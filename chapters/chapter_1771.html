<h1>Chapter 1762: The Poison Curse</h1><p>Having ascertained Qin Sang's purpose, You Yishi left Qin Sang where he was and went into the inner hall.</p><p>After a stick of incense.</p><p>You Yishi returned, “It can be done! The Xuanji Gate master and that senior are close friends. If you can present credentials and visit them, the senior will write a letter requesting the Xuanji Gate master to come out of seclusion.”</p><p>Encountering a close friend of the Xuanji Gate master was fortuitous, but Qin Sang wasn't surprised; most Dan Dao masters had wide-ranging connections.</p><p>This would be a one-time solution, allowing him to focus on seclusion and breakthrough after completing the Mandate.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this, clasped his hands and said, “This Daoist is willing to accept this Mandate.”</p><p>He still didn’t know the Mandate’s specific contents.</p><p>Only after selecting the person would You Yishi transmit the Mandate.</p><p>Unexpectedly, You Yishi did not directly grant the Mandate, but said indifferently, “When you go to visit, another Daoist has also been chosen for this Mandate.  According to custom, one must be selected from the two of you. Of course, both Daoists can also negotiate and accept the Mandate together.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Completing the Mandate together might be easier, but it meant the reward would also be split, which he didn't want.</p><p>Furthermore, cooperating with an unknown stranger might not be pleasant.</p><p>Qin Sang trusted himself more, and said solemnly, “How does Your Excellency intend to choose?”</p><p>Depending on the Mandate's task, the Daoist Court had corresponding methods to select suitable candidates.</p><p>You Yishi nodded, “Seeing that you don't plan to cooperate with that Daoist, it seems you both agree. You may face a strong enemy this time, so let's decide with strength…”</p><p>Saying this, You Yishi gestured with a hand and walked towards the inner hall.</p><p>Qin Sang followed You Yishi through the main hall. His vision blurred, and a sea of mist appeared before him.</p><p>Entering the mist, his vision was obstructed, and Qin Sang felt an invisible pressure.</p><p>After a few breaths, he saw the mist parting ahead, revealing a large open area, forming a misty platform. A tall, thin Daoist was waiting ahead.</p><p>Seeing the two, the Daoist quickly stepped forward, first bowing to You Yishi, saying a word of thanks, then turning to Qin Sang, “This Daoist is Yun Wei of Lougu Mountain. This Daoist seems unfamiliar. May I ask your Daoist name?”</p><p>“Qingfeng.”</p><p>Qin Sang answered concisely and without emotion, observing Yun Wei.</p><p>Judging by his aura, although not as profound as the Nine Heavens You Yishi, he also possessed late-Yuan Ying cultivation.</p><p>Yun Wei was slightly startled, but quickly regained his composure, saying, “The one vying for the Mandate with this Daoist is you, I presume.  This Daoist has an unassuming request: could you yield this opportunity to this Daoist? This Daoist will not let you go empty-handed; I am willing to offer a bottle of spirit pills.”</p><p>While Yun Wei observed Qin Sang, Qin Sang was also observing him, feeling that Qin Sang's aura seemed erratic, yet with a mysterious quality that was hard to fathom.</p><p>Yun Wei thought quickly. If Qin Sang’s strength was inferior, he would simply deal with him directly; such individuals were the most troublesome.</p><p>If he could dissuade him with a bottle of spirit pills, it would be a win-win situation.</p><p>Yun Wei took out a porcelain bottle, his tone sincere, “This opportunity to commission Lingxu Master to refine pills is extremely important to this Daoist. If you would be so kind as to relinquish it, this Daoist would be eternally grateful.”</p><p>Unfortunately, even with Yun Wei’s eloquent words, Qin Sang remained unmoved, not even checking what pills were in the bottle. “Sorry, this Daoist also has unavoidable reasons.”</p><p>Yun Wei put away the spirit pill with a look of disappointment, “It seems we can only settle this with our hands.”</p><p>…</p><p>You Yishi explained the rules to the two, stepped aside, and left them on the platform.</p><p>The duel had virtually no rules, with no restrictions on methods.  Anyone forced off the platform or who voluntarily surrendered would be judged the loser. The principle was to stop when appropriate, but if both sides fought fiercely or were too intense to hold back, deaths were not unheard of.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the center of the misty platform, quietly watching his opponent without any other movements.</p><p>Yun Wei did not summon any troops; he raised a finger and pointed before him, a yellowish-brown talisman manifested, and then a Bagua Xuan shield appeared beside him, slowly rotating around him.</p><p>“It seems this person cultivates the Golden Seal Sect…”</p><p>Seeing Yun Wei not forming a battle array, Qin Sang was slightly relieved.</p><p>He hadn't had the chance to fight a military sect Daoist before, but through various information, he could judge that military sect Daoists were the most troublesome.</p><p>A Yuan Ying level military sect Daoist would surely have a transformed-stage great demon by their side, with countless demon soldiers under their command. The power of the divine ability displayed by the combined demon soldiers was formidable.</p><p>His delay was to see what school Yun Wei belonged to before considering his countermeasures.</p><p>He planned to keep using the identity of Daoist Qingfeng; he had spent considerable effort cultivating this identity over the years.</p><p>What he showed before the Nine Heavens You Yishi now, he would have to maintain in the future; ideally there should be no inconsistencies.</p><p>Using only physical strength to disguise himself as a Dragon Tiger Sect Daoist would be easiest.</p><p>However, he hadn’t yet perfected the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" and two physical strength divine abilities, and he wasn't entirely confident facing a military sect Daoist.</p><p>Yun Wei conjured three dark shields, preparing to cast a spell. Qin Sang, without hesitation, dashed towards his opponent.</p><p>The misty platform proved too small a battlefield.</p><p>If all went well, Qin Sang could reach Yun Wei in an instant.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's aggressive momentum, Yun Wei remained calm, flicking his wrist. A blue light shot through the air.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>A rush of water. The blue light shattered before Qin Sang, and a gigantic figure leaped from the void.</p><p>The giant was at least ten feet tall, immensely strong, clad in blue armor that shimmered like a lake.</p><p>"Seize him!"</p><p>Yun Wei pointed at Qin Sang, a cold command.</p><p>The giant looked down on Qin Sang, as if at an ant.  Following the order, he raised his arms, his enormous hands clapping together.</p><p>Qin Sang was caught between the giant's palms, feeling the wind buffet him, incredible pressure bearing down.</p><p>He formed the Lotus Seal, his figure shimmering, and vanished from between the giant's hands.</p><p>Yun Wei's eyes narrowed, quickly scanning the area around the giant.  Spotting Qin Sang, his expression changed instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, the giant roared, bringing his fists to his forehead and smashing them down.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang appeared before the giant, his hand forming the Demon-crushing Seal, gently pressing it against the giant's forehead.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Water sprayed everywhere.</p><p>The giant fell backward, his body instantly disintegrating, killed by Qin Sang's single blow.</p><p>Yun Wei hadn't expected the giant to be so easily defeated, but he was no novice.  He didn't panic; a ball of energy erupted from his head, forming a vortex in midair.</p><p>The surrounding mist was drawn into the vortex, swirling and coalescing into bizarre mist beasts.  As they solidified, light flickered in their eyes.</p><p>In an instant, a legion of mist beasts appeared before Yun Wei.</p><p>They surrounded Qin Sang, acting not like lifeless puppets, but like sentient creatures.</p><p>"Spirit-Imbued Army!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression tightened.</p><p>Spirit-Imbued Army was a renowned Daoist technique. He knew of its power.</p><p>This technique created an army from nothing—magical soldiers, similar to the Daoist talismansoldiers.  </p><p>Even without a military training ground, one could have an army using Spirit-Imbued Army or talisman soldiers.</p><p>Talismansoldiers relied on talismans; one destroyed meant one less. Magical soldiers consumed the caster's energy; with enough energy, they were limitless.</p><p>Legend held that at the peak of the Spirit-Imbued Army technique, one could control humans, demons, and ghosts. Yun Wei clearly hadn't reached that level yet.</p><p>These magical soldiers were still inanimate objects, lacking the intelligence of a real army.</p><p>Qin Sang, without hesitation, used the Lotus Seal, moving like a phantom amongst the mist beast soldiers.</p><p>Where he passed, the mist beasts disintegrated, but more kept appearing.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang was surrounded.  Individually weak, the mist beasts possessed an invisible force; once the formation was established, no matter how many Qin Sang destroyed, they regenerated instantly, achieving a form of immortality.</p><p>Yun Wei smiled.  This technique was perfect for wearing down demon cultivators and powerful physical fighters. It always worked.</p><p>He muttered an incantation, about to trap Qin Sang, when his brow furrowed slightly. He stared intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>He sensed a change in Qin Sang, but couldn't quite define it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the besieged Qin Sang remained unhurried, a slight smile on his lips, strolling towards Yun Wei.</p><p>With each step Qin Sang took, the formation vanished. The mist beasts that would normally regenerate indefinitely simply disappeared, leaving large gaps in the array.</p><p>Yun Wei had never encountered a physical cultivator who could so easily break this formation. He was shocked.</p><p>The watching Nine Heavens Inspector's eyes flashed, reassessing Qin Sang.</p><p>*"The Great Unfettered Seal, so it is!"* Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Today, he finally understood some of the mysteries of the Diamond Unfettered Seal.</p><p>If Qin Sang had to describe it in one word, it would be instinct.</p><p>The moment he used the seal, he entered a strange state, where everything on the battlefield was clear to him; his opponent's weaknesses were instantly obvious.</p><p>His perception reached its peak – not a heightened awareness from powerful spiritual sense, but instinct.</p><p>Combat was his instinct!</p><p>If Yun Wei himself had fought, there might not have been many flaws to exploit. But these fog beast constructs were not Yun Wei, and even if Yun Wei controlled them mentally, there was still a distance.</p><p>What seemed like a seamless formation revealed many gaps to Qin Sang, gaps that could be severed with a finger or a palm strike.</p><p>"This seal…"</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in this peculiar state, astonished, and his appraisal of the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals* rose yet another level.</p><p>He had thought the seventh seal was like the previous six, enhancing a single aspect, but he underestimated it. This seal brought about a comprehensive transformation, elevating the technique to a whole new tier.</p><p>With this seal, even Qin Sang, who lacked experience in brute-force combat, had the confidence to face the top experts in this field!</p><p>"If I were to use the Spirit Wood body to cast the Diamond Great Freedom Seal…"</p><p>Qin Sang had this thought, eager to try it out.</p><p>Although the Immortal City lacked the flourishing of ten thousand trees, and the artificial wooden stele was restricted, the Spirit Wood body alone would give his physical body a tremendous boost.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yun Wei continuously cast spells to control the constructs' formations, but no matter what formation he used, he couldn't stop Qin Sang's advance. His expression grew increasingly grave.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang rapidly approach, Yun Wei finally made up his mind. The light in his brow flickered, illuminating the void.</p><p>In the void, it was as if an invisible hand sketched an extremely complex rune, completing it in one go. The fog beast constructs below seamlessly integrated with the rune's aura, each beast a node in a connected network, instantly forming a huge spirit talisman!</p><p>"Subdue!"</p><p>Yun Wei roared.</p><p>With a resounding boom, all the constructs shattered, transforming into streams of pure spiritual energy that flowed into the talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang felt something above him; looking up, he saw a ruler-shaped blue talisman descending, an awe-inspiring pressure bearing down from the heavens.</p><p>At this moment, both figures on the mist platform vanished. The vortex above Yun Wei expanded countless times, engulfing the entire stage.  Qin Sang was undoubtedly at the vortex's center.</p><p>While casting the spell, Yun Wei quickly took out a bronze whistle and brought it to his lips, about to blow it, when he suddenly felt a violent tremor in the void.</p><p>The source of the tremor was his talisman.</p><p>'Rip!'</p><p>The tremor intensified, followed by a tearing sound.</p><p>A withered arm, like a blade, pierced through the vortex, its palm transforming into a blade, slicing downwards, instantly splitting the vortex in two.</p><p>Streams of water erupted from the shattered vortex, revealing a tall tree-like figure, standing erect and firm as a mountain.</p><p>Yun Wei stared at the tree-person, momentarily stunned, and instinctively blew the whistle.</p><p>A whistle sounded.</p><p>Yun Wei's true energy poured into the whistle, then spewed out a purple rainbow. The rainbow touched the water in the void and instantly disappeared.</p><p>What followed was a strange change in the seemingly harmless water flow.</p><p>Countless tadpole-like, writhing runes swam in the water, everywhere, twisting and forming faces like malevolent ghosts.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The water, carrying countless ghosts, surged towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before reaching Qin Sang, the water flow abruptly dissipated, the ghosts vanishing.</p><p>Simultaneously, a gray ghost-like image suddenly appeared on Qin Sang's chest, like a tattoo on his body, flashing by in an instant—it had invaded his body.</p><p>Yun Wei smiled.</p><p>Since the start of the fight, he had laid out his traps layer by layer, and finally succeeded!</p><p>These streams of water looked like harmless aftereffects of the talisman, but he secretly cast a spell. Once the whistle was blown, the two forces merged, instantly becoming a rare and potent poison, coupled with his poison curse, catching his opponent off guard. Before they could react, they would be poisoned, their combat power severely weakened.</p><p>The next moment, Yun Wei's smile froze.</p><p>Qin Sang swept towards him, swift as thunder, showing no signs of poisoning whatsoever.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The overwhelming momentum shook Yun Wei's spirit, causing him to hurriedly raise three八卦玄盾  in front of him.</p><p>With a series of bangs, Qin Sang's blows shattered and sent the shields flying, offering no resistance.</p><p>Yun Wei's expression shifted, seeming hesitant, eventually sighing and gritting his teeth, "I concede!"</p><p>He still had unused techniques, mostly related to poison curses, but judging by his opponent's current state, it was uncertain how effective they would be.</p><p>There were other great alchemists in the world besides Master Lingxu, so why risk exposing all his cards here?</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Destroyer Seal, accompanied by wind and thunder, arrived, stopping almost against Yun Wei's face.</p><p>Qin Sang swayed, stepping back half a pace, retracted his Spirit Wood body, and clasped his hands, "I yield!"</p><p></p>
