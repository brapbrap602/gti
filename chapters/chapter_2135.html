<h1>Chapter 2125: The Dharma Body Strikes</h1><p>A misty rain shrouded the battlefield.</p><p>The army advanced silently.</p><p>Initially, the front was merely dim, but it suddenly plunged into utter darkness. Countless eerie figures seemed to lurk within the shadows—the thunder soldiers conjured by the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique.</p><p>The two sides had clashed many times before, and without hesitation, they collided again. In an instant, blinding lightning flashed, and magical treasures flew through the air.  The scene in the downpour grew increasingly chaotic, shimmering with the light of various magical powers, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe.</p><p>In a short time, the battle became incredibly fierce.</p><p>On the battlefield, Li Yue and others searched for Qin Sang’s whereabouts.</p><p>“Form the formation!”</p><p>Without finding Qin Sang, Li Yue didn’t persist. He transmitted his order, his gaze shifting to Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo nodded gravely, chanting an incantation and forming a peculiar magical seal. His figure gradually became translucent, and white clouds surged around him.</p><p>In a flash, Min Zhuo transformed into a cloud of mist. The dense clouds seemed endless, continuously expanding outwards without thinning.  Min Zhuo’s figure vanished into the mist, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>Min Zhuo’s position was the eye of the formation. His action signified the activation of the great array.</p><p>While engaging the thunder soldiers, the Lu Wang army's battle formations had undergone multiple shifts, but previously they had performed poorly, not exhibiting significant power.  The activation of the array now revealed its true ingenuity!</p><p>'Whoosh…whoosh…'</p><p>A chilling wind whipped through the rain.</p><p>White clouds billowed across the battlefield, their light forms drifting upwards, morphing into various shapes.  Simultaneously, these clouds expanded, and new clouds continued to form, gradually merging into one.</p><p>In an instant, a massive white cloud enveloped the battlefield.  The appearance of the cloud did not amplify the storm's fury but, conversely, seemed to weaken the downpour.</p><p>The cloud expanded, the vapor continuously rising.</p><p>In fact, the vapor wasn't as light as it appeared. After the cloud formed, the void frequently trembled, as if a giant hammer incessantly pounded the heavens, attempting to shatter the Nine Heavens Azure Pool!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>…</p><p>The cloud stirred up a tempest, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>Since Qin Sang unleashed the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique, the rain curtain had never been so significantly affected. In some areas, the rainfall suddenly weakened, becoming intermittent, with some places even clearing up.</p><p>Whenever this phenomenon occurred, the nearby thunder soldiers' power would be affected; severely affected ones even disintegrated before they could self-destruct.</p><p>In these areas, the Lu Wang army launched counterattacks. They had been suppressed until now, but finally gained the upper hand.  With the reversal of battles in multiple areas, the morale of the Lu Wang army soared.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could not allow the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique to be broken.  Lightning flashed across the sky, suddenly becoming denser, carrying terrifying power,</p><p>striking towards the cloud.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>…</p><p>Each lightning bolt tore a large hole in the cloud, ripping apart the vapor. The aftermath of the lightning could be clearly seen ravaging the inside of the cloud, annihilating countless wisps of cloud. But as the lightning's power dissipated, an endless stream of vapor immediately replenished it.</p><p>Under the furious assault of lightning, the cloud was riddled with holes, repeatedly tearing and mending, yet these attacks still couldn’t stop the cloud’s ascent.  The clash between the two intensified!</p><p>Gradually, the vapor, initially a small clump, grew into a boundless, vast sea of clouds, exhibiting the potential to rival the thunderstorm.</p><p>Once the vapor filled the nine heavens, it might truly be able to obliterate the Nine Heavens Azure Pool and devour all the 'rain'!</p><p>While Min Zhuo and others exerted all their strength to activate the formation, Li Yue stood ready, activating his spirit eye technique to scan every corner of the battlefield.</p><p>Failing to find Qin Sang, he looked up at the sky and murmured, “How much longer can you endure? You should make your move now!”</p><p>As soon as this thought crossed his mind, Li Yue felt a sudden warning.</p><p>Within his perception, four auras appeared simultaneously in four different directions. These four auras were very familiar—Qin Sang, the Frost Weasel, the stone statue, and the fire bird—old adversaries who had repeatedly appeared on the battlefield.</p><p>The moment they appeared, they erupted with astonishing power and speed, charging towards a certain point within the cloud.</p><p>Li Yue knew that this was where Clan Chief Min Zhuo was located—the enemy was indeed aiming to destroy the formation's eye!</p><p>Everything was as the Grand Patron had foreseen. Li Yue quickly identified Qin Sang's aura and personally intercepted him.</p><p>Qin Sang, once alone, had dared to charge into the enemy ranks facing a multitude of experts.</p><p>His strength had been proven, his past performances truly awe-inspiring.  Among those present, only Li Yue dared to face Qin Sang alone!</p><p>Of course, the others had previously been hesitant before Qin Sang, fearing the Five Elements Crown. Now, with a way to counter both the Crown and the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique, their fear was lessened.</p><p>Without Li Yue's command, the cultivators had already taken out the Six Harmonies Decree, but they held back, preparing a surprise for Qin Sang.</p><p>Li Yue flew forward, his brow flashing with spiritual light, shooting out three white beams that landed before him, transforming into three companion beasts.</p><p>These three were all rare types of demonic oxen, tall, strong, and exceptionally powerful.  But their breeds differed: one a green ox, one black, and one white ox with a rhinoceros horn, its lineage unknown.</p><p>'Moo!'</p><p>The three demonic oxen roared like thunder, each expelling a breath of green, black, and white respectively from their nostrils, all converging on Li Yue.</p><p>The next moment, the three breaths transformed into a three-colored suit of armor on Li Yue. The armor was incredibly thick, its surface shimmering with tri-colored spiritual light.</p><p>Li Yue's body wasn't particularly large, but clad in this armor, he exuded a terrifying aura, supremely imposing and possessing boundless power. His eyes were like two deep pools, surveying all creation!</p><p>Years ago, Lu Gan and Qin Sang had a brief encounter, revealing Qin Sang to be a body cultivator.  The Grand Deacon then specifically invited Li Yue to counter Qin Sang. However, due to apprehension about the Five Elements Divine Light, they had only been probing, Li Yue rarely having a chance to strike.</p><p>Clad in his armor, Li Yue stepped forward, instantly traversing countless sand dunes to block Qin Sang's path.</p><p>If Qin Sang only possessed the strength he had shown before, with the Five Elements Crown and the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique countered, Li Yue was confident he could stop him.</p><p>Li Yue could even spare some attention to his surroundings, lest someone launch a surprise attack.</p><p>The next moment, Li Yue suddenly noticed something amiss with Qin Sang, his pupils contracting sharply.</p><p>He had not fought Qin Sang many times, and for some reason, the Qin Sang before him seemed strange and unusual.</p><p>"That spirit-tablet-like treasure is gone…"</p><p>This thought crossed Li Yue's mind, as Qin Sang was already closing in.</p><p>Giving Li Yue no time to think, five-colored radiance flashed from Qin Sang's sleeve, and the Five Elements Crown spun out.</p><p>Instantly, the Five Elements Divine Light bypassed Li Yue, shooting towards the array eye.</p><p>Qin Sang's immediate use of the Five Elements Divine Light was unexpected, but Li Yue and the others were prepared.</p><p>Red flames appeared in the mist, instantly forming into balls of fire. Within the flames, the Six Harmonies Decrees emerged, turning to face the array eye. The gems inlaid on the Decrees shone with blue light, and blue flames erupted before the array eye.</p><p>The blue flames raged, forming a circular ring of fire, with the Five Elements Divine Light striking its very center.</p><p>Behind the ring of fire, in the array eye, mist swirled, and Min Zhuo's figure flickered.</p><p>At this moment, all the masters on the battlefield anxiously watched the array eye. The figure within it swayed slightly, then moved away with the array eye, Min Zhuo unharmed!</p><p>"It worked!"</p><p>The crowd rejoiced.</p><p>It was proven: the Six Harmonies Decree could counter the crown!  From now on, they no longer had to fear the Five Elements Divine Light!</p><p>Watching the Five Elements Divine Light be dispelled, Qin Sang remained composed, showing no surprise.  It would have been strange if, after so many times, they *didn't* have a countermeasure.</p><p>Without pause, Qin Sang's advance continued unabated, his distance from Li Yue shrinking.</p><p>At this moment, Li Yue's feelings were diametrically opposed to the others.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang attacked, he finally understood the source of the strange feeling.</p><p>"Nascent Soul Mid-stage! No! That's not a Dharma Image, could it be…"</p><p>Initially, Li Yue thought Qin Sang was using some secret technique to conceal his cultivation, but when a sword light pierced his eyes, he instantly realized a possibility.</p><p>In an instant, his vision was filled with countless sword shadows, each incredibly sharp, tearing apart the void.</p><p>"Sword cultivator!"</p><p>Li Yue was furious and shocked. He had prepared for a fierce battle with Qin Sang, all his preparations based on Qin Sang being a body cultivator.</p><p>He had been guarding against ambushes, never expecting the change to come from Qin Sang himself!</p><p>The consequences of this misjudgment were severe. Although he and Qin Sang were at similar levels, losing the initiative meant he had already lost half the battle. Moreover, one of his companion beasts remained within the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram, meaning he wasn't at full strength!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Surrounded by sword shadows.</p><p>Li Yue instinctively raised his arm and swung a powerful palm strike.</p><p>A terrifying hurricane, born from a single palm strike, swept across the battlefield.  Within the hurricane, a gigantic palm shadow materialized, capable of flattening mountains with ease.</p><p>The sword-light was obliterated, but Li Yue’s spirits weren't lifted. He found himself plunged into a deep, starlit sky, surrounded by countless celestial bodies that resembled spiritual swords, each imbued with potent sword intent.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Even in this boundless expanse, the colossal palm appeared small.  It struck the void, causing the star-swords to flicker momentarily before returning to their normal state.</p><p>…</p><p>While Li Yue fell into the sword array, Si Lu and the others engaged the enemy.  Three fierce battles erupted simultaneously, each a spectacle of light and energy, while Qin Sang's area remained eerily silent.</p><p>To avoid the Five Elements Divine Light, Min Zhuo was forced to shift the array's eye, causing a brief pause in the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity. The power of his Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique surged, unleashing a torrent of thunder that smashed down on the cloud formation, suppressing the Si You Clan experts.</p><p>The tide turned.  Despite their smaller numbers, their momentum was unstoppable, making it unclear who would ultimately prevail.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the edge of the storm, a figure emerged: the Grand Deacon.</p><p>His eyes gleamed as he fixed his gaze on Qin Sang.</p><p>"Body and cultivation dual cultivation!"</p><p>Only now did the Grand Deacon realize he had greatly underestimated Qin Zhenren.  He had achieved astonishing mastery in both aspects of his cultivation.</p><p>With merely early Transcendence stage cultivation of his Dharma Image, he had defeated numerous experts. What level of power did his Dharma Body, a far higher cultivation, possess?  And he'd even escaped the Heavenly Binding Golden Lock!</p><p>Qin Zhenren’s true strength might be comparable to that of a late-stage cultivator.  He could easily stand as a pillar for Si Lu!</p><p>The Grand Deacon mused to himself, Xia Changshi must have fallen. Otherwise, with two late-stage cultivators in their ranks, they could have openly challenged the battlefield, instead of resorting to underhanded tactics.</p><p>Even the Si Emperor would hesitate before confronting two such powerhouses.</p><p>Their opponent's trump card had been revealed, though it was unexpected.</p><p>However, this outcome might prove better than having Xia Changshi unscathed.  While Qin Zhenren possessed the strength of a late-stage cultivator, he hadn't yet reached that realm, possessing weaknesses that a true late-stage expert would not have.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to sense this, glancing up. His gaze, piercing the downpour, was unfathomable.</p><p>Yet it seemed a mere casual glance; his real target remained the array's eye and the clan leader, Min Zhuo, stationed there. Eliminating him would resolve many problems.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand towards the array's eye.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Unusual thunder echoed from the heavens.</p><p>The Azure Pool within Qin Sang began to churn, and a point of lightning emerged from his fingertip, shooting towards the heavens!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Within the downpour, lightning exploded, illuminating everything in brilliant detail. Electric threads danced between raindrops, enveloping the storm zone and forming a dense net in the sky.</p><p>The darkness vanished, replaced by a blinding light.</p><p>Heaven and earth's energy surged, drawn by the lightning threads, forming a spiritual tide. New lightning then birthed from this tide, monstrous thunder serpents and pythons rising to the surface, stepping through the void to form mysterious lightning glyphs.</p><p>The glyphs hung in the air, beams of light showering down.  The shape of a thunder seal manifested, high in the heavens, like the heart of the heavens, the master of thunder!</p><p>It was a complete Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal!</p><p>Today, following the possession by the Thunder Ancestor, Qin Sang finally unleashed the complete Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal glyph! Its power echoed faintly with that of the ancient days!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The rolling thunder made the cultivators in the storm squint, their hearts filled with terror.</p><p>The Grand Deacon outside the rain, his face slightly changed, flicked a finger. A golden light shot out, revealing the Heavenly Binding Golden Lock; he had secretly summoned it, guarding against unforeseen events.</p><p>Its power in his hands far surpassed that when wielded by Lu Gan.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and the Grand Deacon reacted swiftly, the golden light erupting almost simultaneously with the appearance of the thunder seal. Heaven and earth were split—one half blazing with lightning, the other ablaze with golden light.</p><p>The golden light forcefully penetrated the downpour, a gigantic golden lock materializing at its center, confronting the Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal in the sky.</p><p>Meanwhile, the lightning shone, threatening to engulf the array's eye and Min Zhuo.</p><p>"It's over!"</p><p>Someone thought.</p><p>Facing such terrifying power, Min Zhuo, alone, stood little chance; it all depended on whether Lu Gan and the Grand Deacon could save him in time.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The sound of the lock latch closing was faint, yet clear amidst the thunder, releasing an invisible wave that seemed to restrain both heaven and earth, and the thunder itself!</p>
