<h1></h1><p>Main body of the Ice Palace.</p><p>The light and shadow of the ethereal blue sky illuminated every corner of the Ice Palace.</p><p>For a long time, the appearance of the Ice Palace had remained unchanged, sitting quietly within the Immortal Sect's legacy grounds.</p><p>Without intrusion, the ethereal blue skylight barely flickered.</p><p>Only where Guailanren and Qiling Dongzhu walked, the ethereal blue of the skylight suddenly deepened, and the power of remnant formations continuously attacked them.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The gate of one of the Ice Palaces was blasted off, slamming heavily onto the ground and shattering into pieces. A wave of green energy surged out from the Ice Palace, causing nearby runes to dissipate and the binding force of the restrictions to collapse.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the two walked through the empty doorway and emerged.</p><p>A ball of green light floated in front of Guailanren's chest, which was a wooden bead.</p><p>The wooden bead had just withdrawn its spiritual light; it was this treasure that had blasted open the Ice Palace gate and shattered the restrictions here.</p><p>As the two stepped out of the Ice Palace, they felt the pressure surge. They both looked up in unison and saw the skylight pressing down on them. The skylight was gloomy, and the heavy pressure was suffocating.</p><p>Clearly, breaking the Ice Palace gate had triggered a chain reaction in the remnant formations.</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu calmly formed a hand seal.</p><p>The red flower magical treasure floating above his head vibrated gently, emitting a soft force that lifted upwards, supporting the descending skylight.</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu didn't directly confront the remnant formation. Using gentleness to overcome force, he resisted for a moment, and the skylight calmed down on its own, the pressure disappearing along with it.</p><p>The spirit formation was incomplete. Among the Ice Palaces, some were intact, while others were severely damaged.</p><p>The remnant formations were fragmented and couldn't form a whole. They only needed to deal with the power of the remnant formations within a certain range around them. As long as they were careful not to make any large movements, dealing with them wasn't too difficult.</p><p>For the two of them, the threat within the Ice Palaces was not as great as the Qilin Shadow Wall.</p><p>"There aren't many palaces left. Based on the layout of the Wood Aspect Hall, the remaining ones should all be core palaces, similar to the Ancestral Hall…"</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu estimated the distance they had traveled within the Ice Palaces. They were already close to the core, and Guailanren still hadn't found that unknown precious wood.</p><p>"The aura is still ahead," Guailanren's senses became clearer, and he asserted, "It won't be too far!"</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu rubbed his hands together. "It seems that precious wood is highly valuable, and the Water Aspect lineage treasures it greatly. By following the aura, we can not only obtain the precious wood but also have the opportunity to find the Water Aspect lineage's treasury and strike it rich. It's killing two birds with one stone!"</p><p>"If we find the treasury, that precious wood belongs to me, and Dongzhu can choose from the other treasures first."</p><p>Guailanren wasn't greedy. For the upcoming journey to Emperor Bestowal Mountain, Qiling Dongzhu was an indispensable helper, and it wasn't worth falling out over the Water Aspect lineage's treasury.</p><p>"I thank you in advance, fellow Daoist."</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu laughed heartily and quickly followed Guailanren into the next palace.</p><p>Not long after they left.</p><p>A figure flashed, gradually solidifying in front of the gate fragments. It was Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>He stood openly beneath the skylight, yet he didn't suffer any attacks.</p><p>"What a pity. It seems these two don't plan to separate. Otherwise, defeating them individually would be much easier…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the direction the two had left, thoughts flashing through his mind. A cold glint appeared in his eyes, clearly revealing his killing intent.</p><p>Guailanren's divine abilities were too strange. His avatar was hidden in the secret chamber of the Ice Palace, yet he could still sense it. Moreover, this person coveted his avatar's body relentlessly, posing a constant threat in the future.</p><p>Before, Guailanren's focus was on the Formless Immortal Sect. Once this matter was over and he freed up his hands, he would inevitably target his avatar. This person had gained benefits from the Formless Immortal Sect, and his future strength was hard to gauge.</p><p>He couldn't possibly hand over the Dao Manifestation Tree, nor could he constantly be on guard, never allowing his avatar to leave his main body.</p><p>One coveted the spiritual tree.</p><p>The other needed to protect his avatar.</p><p>There was no possibility of resolving the grudge between them!</p><p>Qin Sang understood the principle of striking first and wouldn't sit still and wait for death.</p><p>At this moment, the enemy was in the open, and he was in the dark. Even if the opponent had a helper, it was a chance not to be missed, worth a try!</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered and disappeared.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Inside the secret chamber.</p><p>The avatar sat cross-legged beside the ice platform, his mind entirely focused on the remnant formations.</p><p>Through the remnant formations, the avatar could perceive the actions of those within the spirit formation and was well aware of Guailanren and Qiling Dongzhu's movements. As expected, these two were heading straight for the Ancestral Hall, getting closer and closer!</p><p>His true body was following behind them.</p><p>Their every move couldn't escape the avatar's perception.</p><p>With the avatar's assistance, the true body followed the two calmly, without worrying about being discovered.</p><p>"Almost there…"</p><p>The avatar muttered to himself, his expression becoming increasingly serious.</p><p>The remnant formations corresponding to the treasure banner and the damaged banners were near the Ancestral Hall, ahead of Guailanren and Qiling Dongzhu. Qin Sang planned to ambush them there, currently separated from them by only two rows of palaces!</p><p>A great battle was imminent.</p><p>This battle must eliminate Guailanren; Qiling Dongzhu was secondary.</p><p>Of course, if he could kill both of them, Qin Sang wouldn't hesitate in the slightest.</p><p>Fighting two top experts alone, even with the advantage of time and place, Qin Sang didn't dare to relax in the slightest. His mind was tense, and he had already run through countless simulations in a short period.</p><p>A tense atmosphere filled the secret chamber, the void almost solidifying.</p><p>The surface of the treasure banner tightened, its spiritual light flickering unsteadily. After ten thousand years of dormancy, it finally had the opportunity to fight again!</p><p>In the blink of an eye.</p><p>Guailanren and Qiling Dongzhu passed through another palace.</p><p>Only one row of palaces remained between them and the ambush location!</p><p>Qin Sang's true body abandoned his previous leisurely pace. His speed suddenly increased, traversing rows of palaces at maximum speed, closing in on the enemy!</p><p>A great battle was imminent!</p><p>At this critical juncture.</p><p>Guailanren and Qiling Dongzhu passed through the ice garden between the two rows of palaces and were about to enter the main hall of the last row of palaces when Guailanren suddenly noticed a pavilion in the corner of the ice garden and let out a soft "Eh? The Uncaring Pavilion!"</p><p>The two stopped in their tracks, halting before the last row of palaces.</p><p>Qin Sang and his avatar nearly cursed out loud.</p><p>"Do you recognize this spirit pavilion, fellow Daoist?" Qiling Dongzhu followed his gaze.</p><p>Guailanren nodded. "I recall reading a classic that recorded some anecdotes of brilliant predecessors from the five lineages. Among them, there was an Uncaring Venerable from the Water Aspect lineage. The Formless Immortal Sect doesn't adhere strictly to Buddhist or Daoist paths, or any other for that matter. It is said this person was a Buddhist cultivator who once sealed his cultivation, taking only an alms bowl and a kasaya, and wandered the mortal world practicing ascetic cultivation. After returning, he built the Uncaring Pavilion in the Ice Ritual Palace, secluded himself for a hundred years, attained great enlightenment, and emerged directly as a Nascent Soul cultivator. It's a legendary tale!"</p><p>"This Uncaring Pavilion is the legacy site of a Nascent Soul cultivator?"</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu's eyes lit up. He glanced up and down, seeing that the Uncaring Pavilion was intact, and rushed forward impatiently.</p><p>Guailanren hesitated for a moment before flashing to follow.</p><p>Compared to the other palaces, the Uncaring Pavilion wasn't grand, only two stories high.  Tucked away in a corner of the ice garden, there was nothing remarkable about it. Presumably, its inconspicuousness was the reason it had been spared from destruction.</p><p>Arriving in front of the Uncaring Pavilion.</p><p>Guailanren and Qiling Dongzhu fumbled for a while, finding the weakness in the Uncaring Pavilion's entrance restriction. One wielded the wooden bead, the other unleashed wooden thorns, joining forces to break open the door.</p><p>Golden light suddenly appeared.</p><p>Buddha light formed a wall of light, but some areas of the wall were thick, while others were weak.</p><p>The two had sharp eyes and attacked precisely the weak points of the Buddha light.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The wall of light was continuously worn down by the two, the Buddha light dimming.  Amidst the cracking sound, it was torn open.</p><p>A vine shot into the wall of light, pushing open the door of the Uncaring Pavilion.</p><p>Seeing nothing unusual, the two entered.</p><p>But soon, they emerged from the Uncaring Pavilion with disappointed faces.</p><p>Inside the Uncaring Pavilion, there was only a meditation cushion, an incense burner, and a burner full of incense ash. Where were the legacy items of a Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p>That Uncaring Venerable had truly embraced the mortal world. The meditation cushion and incense burner were ordinary mortal items, made of very common materials, not even considered magical artifacts.</p><p>The legacy site of a Nascent Soul cultivator was a misnomer!</p><p>The two had wasted their efforts. Their gazes swept across the row of palaces, their interest greatly diminished.  Finding the precious wood and the treasury was the priority.</p><p>They walked out of the Uncaring Pavilion, not returning to the main hall, but instead choosing a nearby path, breaking restrictions along the way, passing through this row of palaces.</p><p>This seemingly ordinary action caused Qin Sang's true body and avatar to change expressions.</p><p>Behind this row of palaces was an ice lake.</p><p>Mist drifted across the ice lake. Several jade bridges spanned the shores, along with islands and pavilions in the center of the lake, appearing and disappearing within the cold mist, like a fairyland.</p><p>Although there were damaged areas, they didn't detract from its beauty.</p><p>Strangely, despite being a single lake, some areas were frozen, while others had clear, rippling water.</p><p>This ice lake was precisely the area controlled by the treasure banner!</p><p>The frozen areas were due to the incomplete spirit formation, with the formation's power overflowing and affecting the surroundings. The unfrozen, seemingly calm surface of the lake was precisely where the spirit formation was most intact and could be manipulated by the treasure banner. Under the avatar's deliberate concealment, there were no fluctuations of the spirit formation on the ice surface.</p><p>The jade bridge connected to the main hall almost crossed the center of the water, the perfect location for an ambush.</p><p>If the two hadn't been attracted by the Uncaring Pavilion and suddenly changed their path, they would definitely have passed over this jade bridge and entered the trap. Qin Sang could fully utilize the spirit formation's power to separate them and defeat them one by one.</p><p>Yet, they took a small path and stepped onto another jade bridge!</p><p>No matter how well-prepared a plan was, accidents were always unavoidable.</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated for many years and had long understood this truth. He wasn't affected by this, his mind racing, pondering countermeasures.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two figures appeared on the shore of the ice lake.  They paused for a moment, seeing that the ethereal blue skylight around the ice lake was no different from elsewhere, showing no anomalies. They chose a jade bridge and walked onto it.</p><p>This jade bridge wasn't far from the one connected to the main hall.</p><p>But the scenes beneath the two jade bridges were worlds apart.</p><p>The one they chose had an ice surface below. Fortunately, the ice on the right side wasn't large and was close to the water, considered to be on the edge of the treasure banner's control range.</p><p>However, these top experts had extremely fast reactions.</p><p>Once the avatar activated the spirit formation and caused anomalies, they could immediately react. Trying to drag them both into the formation was almost impossible.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two quickly reached the middle of the jade bridge.</p><p>After crossing the ice lake, the Ancestral Hall was not far ahead. There was no opportunity for an ambush.</p><p>Qin Sang had to decide immediately.</p><p>On the jade bridge.</p><p>Guailanren and Qiling Dongzhu walked side by side.</p><p>Guailanren was on the left, and Qiling Dongzhu was on the right, closest to the water.</p><p>If Qin Sang acted, he could only pull this person into the formation. Guailanren would most likely be able to escape.</p><p>"To be safe, I can only deal with one first!  It's him!"</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind, unwilling to give up this great opportunity. He still decided to act. Even if he couldn't eliminate Guailanren, weakening him was still good. He would consider how to deal with him later!</p><p>Inside the secret chamber.</p><p>The avatar pressed his palm firmly against the ice disk, ready to activate the remnant formation at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body had also infiltrated the shore of the ice lake.</p><p>"Most of the buildings here are preserved, and there are fewer traces of battles…"</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu observed the surroundings of the ice lake, conversing with Guailanren.</p><p>Guailanren hummed in agreement, looking down at the ice lake.  He felt a bit more wary of the deeply cold ice surface. He opened his mouth, about to say something, when he suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The ice lake suddenly churned.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the secret chamber.</p><p>The avatar's palm slammed down, his entire body's true essence surging out, pouring into the ice disk.</p><p>The illusory scene within the ice disk changed instantly.  Visible cold煞 energy flowed rapidly within the ice disk, its aura overflowing. A thin layer of ice climbed up the ice platform, about to encase the avatar's arm in ice.</p><p>Just then, the ice platform suddenly brightened, the light instantly flaring to a blinding intensity. The cold, eerie light illuminated the entire secret chamber as if it were daylight.</p><p>A powerful suction force erupted from within the ice platform.</p><p>'Crack, crack, crack...'</p><p>The newly formed thin ice shattered.</p><p>All the cold煞 energy was instantly absorbed by the ice platform, and the chill within the secret chamber greatly decreased.</p><p>The ice platform could absorb spiritual veins, replenishing the ice disk's energy.  It was also the medium between the ice disk and the Ice Palace's grand formation.</p><p>Activated by the avatar, the ice platform transformed into suction, drawing the cold煞 energy within the ice disk continuously, flowing down through the ice disk, and finally injecting it into the formation's core.</p><p>In an instant, the spirit formation runes flashed one after another.</p><p>Guided by the avatar, the cold煞 energy converged, flowing toward where the treasure banner was located.</p><p>Even the damaged banners weren't spared.</p><p>Qin Sang always acted this way.  Once he decided to act, he held nothing back!</p><p>He wouldn't hesitate to collapse the entire Ice Palace's grand formation, activating both the damaged banners and the treasure banner!</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The treasure banner's surface tightened as the cold煞 energy was injected into it through the spirit formation. The treasure banner's form instantly changed, transforming into numerous cold煞 banners, exuding a chilling aura and an imposing presence.</p><p>At the same time, a 'clanging' sound rang out.</p><p>These sounds came from the other damaged banners.</p><p>Some of the damaged banners didn't even have their surfaces left, only bare flagpoles remaining. As soon as the cold煞 energy was injected, the flagpoles vibrated wildly, clear cracks appearing on their surfaces.</p><p>The avatar multitasked, exerting all his effort to control the cold煞 energy, trying to make those damaged banners last as long as possible.</p><p>Meanwhile, above the ice lake, the power of the spirit formation had erupted!</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The calm lake surface was suddenly torn apart, waves surging as water columns shot towards the sky.</p><p>All the power of the remnant formations, under the avatar's control, surged towards this location. The ethereal blue skylight converged madly above the ice lake. Covered by the dense skylight, the ice lake became strangely dark.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The water columns crashed into the skylight.</p><p>A boundless cold wind, seemingly from nowhere, swept across the surface of the water where there was no ice. Visible white gusts of cold wind raged above the water.</p><p>Illusory phenomena vanished, and chilling煞 soared to the heavens!</p><p>In an instant, the ice lake completely transformed into a domain of extreme cold.</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu was right at the edge of the cold wind!</p><p>“Careful!”</p><p>Guailanren roared, his heart sinking.</p><p>Along the way, they had triggered the remnant formations countless times and had already grasped their patterns.</p><p>This kind of phenomenon was clearly not something the remnant formations would produce on their own.</p>
