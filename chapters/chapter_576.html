Chapter 569: Bring Out His Remains


"You don't need to go."
Qin Sang was startled by these words and hurriedly searched around.
The Little Northern Dipper Astral Formation was in tatters, nearing its limit. Several cracks had appeared in the star chart, and the stars were dim.
The cultivators wielding the secrets of the Purple Star were the most numerous group to enter the Purple Star Palace this time.
They had hidden within the Little Northern Dipper Astral Formation, luckily escaping the Abyss of Sin under the formation's protection. But with the formation's collapse, some were unfortunately less lucky.
Fortunately, the formation didn't disintegrate instantly.
Except for the corner that collapsed first, everyone else was prepared and escaped in time.
Qin Sang caught sight of Yun Youzi successfully dodging a crack and felt relieved.
The cultivators present were scattered by the formation's fissures.
After searching for a while, Qin Sang finally saw Granny Jing in a corner of the Little Northern Dipper Astral Formation.
Granny Jing was hunched over, leaning on a cane, appearing very inconspicuous.
Unless someone was looking for her, they would hardly notice her presence.
Leng Yuntian was not far in front of Granny Jing, gathering his disciples. He was completely unaware that the old woman behind him, like a venomous snake, had already set her sights on him.
Granny Jing glanced at Qin Sang and directly told him the location of an ancient hall.
"If you can really go inside and see his remains..."
Granny Jing hesitated, sighing almost imperceptibly, and said softly, "Bring his remains out and let him rest in peace."
Qin Sang understood.
The five-story pagoda tainted by the Blood Defilement Divine Light must be the Yuan Mirage Sect's inherited treasure.
The power of the Eternal Blood Mulberry Formation meticulously arranged by the Abyss of Sin far surpassed Qin Sang's Ebony Sword.  The pagoda was clearly unusable, and Leng Yuntian couldn't possibly restore it so quickly.
During this time in the Purple Star Palace, without the pagoda's protection, Leng Yuntian's power had greatly diminished. No wonder Granny Jing no longer needed Qin Sang's assistance.
Qin Sang was unsure of Granny Jing's true cultivation level.
Back then, when Granny Jing brought him to infiltrate Duke Dongyang's cave, Qin Sang thought she was a Nascent Soul expert, possibly even stronger than the Duke.
However, during the battle at Finger Peak, despite various limitations, Granny Jing didn't seem as dominant against Elder Palmstar as he had imagined.
These two contradictory observations puzzled Qin Sang.
He estimated that Granny Jing's strength was definitely greater than Leng Yuntian's, otherwise she wouldn't be so confident.
Qin Sang glanced at Chen Yan, wondering if she had noticed Granny Jing's transmission. However, Granny Jing's words didn't reveal the reason, so even if Chen Yan had sensed it, there was no need to worry.
Fortunately, Granny Jing kept her word. Although she didn't need his help, she still paid him.
Qin Sang was overjoyed. Saving the Blood Defilement Divine Light was a good thing. After each use, this divine ability required a recovery period, essentially giving him only one chance to use it in the Purple Star Palace.
He now had an extra trump card in case of danger later.
Hearing Granny Jing's last words, Qin Sang realized that she and Senior Qingzhu indeed had a deep connection, though he didn't know the nature of their relationship.
Qin Sang decided that if he encountered Senior Qingzhu's remains, he would definitely bring them out, perhaps earning Granny Jing's favor.
The Abyss of Sin's sneak attack was vicious, causing heavy losses to both realms, especially the Heavenly Path Alliance.  They would certainly retaliate.
After leaving the Purple Star Palace, the cultivation world would likely descend into chaos.
What slightly reassured Qin Sang was that his sect had two Nascent Soul cultivators.  It was better to be under a large tree's shade.  He was more fortunate than disciples from small sects or rogue cultivators.
However, no one would complain about having more support.
Lost in these thoughts, Qin Sang, Qiu Mubai, and the others were flying with Chen Yan when they suddenly felt a tightening sensation, followed by a blinding white light.
A boundless sea of clouds came into view.
They had finally broken through the Immortal Formation and entered the Purple Star Palace!
Before smiles could grace their faces, Chen Yan, instead of flying towards the Heavenly Gate, plunged them into the sea of clouds.  Everything spun.
"So the Purple Star Palace isn't behind the Heavenly Gate, but within the sea of clouds?" Qin Sang still had the leisure to ponder this amidst the dizziness.
A faint force kept them together, preventing them from scattering. With Chen Yan's protection, there was naturally nothing to worry about.
"The Heavenly Gate is above, but the Purple Star Palace is below. Entry isn't through the gate. Is this place below the true Purple Star Palace? Or did the original Purple Star Palace fall from the heavens into the sea of clouds in ancient times?"  Qin Sang felt the logic was flawed.
He had clearly seen emptiness behind the Heavenly Gate, with only the gate itself standing solitary atop the clouds. The view was identical both inside and outside the Immortal Formation.
Qin Sang's suspicion wasn't unfounded. When those senior cultivators first discovered the Purple Star Palace, they had the same doubts.
But no one had ever unravelled the mystery. Whether the Cloud Sea Palace was the fallen Purple Star Palace or another structure remained unknown. Because the Heavenly Gate bore the inscription "Purple Star Palace," they continued to use that name.
However, the Cloud Sea Palace's true identity didn't matter to them.  Even now, no one had fully explored it.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*
In a desolate courtyard, several figures plummeted from the sky, crashing to the ground, crushing yellowed grass and sending dust flying.
Qin Sang grabbed a branch of an ancient tree in the courtyard, lessening the impact before landing on the ground with the broken branch, barely managing to stay on his feet.
Qiu Mubai fared similarly, but the other three were less fortunate, tumbling like gourds, their hair and clothes covered in withered leaves and grass.
After they scrambled up, looking dishevelled, Chen Yan gracefully descended.
She seemed completely unaffected, not even a wrinkle on her robes.
Qin Sang and the others straightened themselves and bowed to Chen Yan.  "Thank you, Grand Ancestor, for your protection."
Chen Yan had revealed her Nascent Soul cultivation. They now treated her with the same respect as Duke Dongyang, offering deep obeisance.
While shocked, Qiu Mubai and the others couldn't hide their joy, clearly understanding what another Nascent Soul expert meant for the sect.
Unexpectedly, Chen Yan declined their reverence, saying indifferently, "I am not your Grand Ancestor.  You may continue to address me as 'Senior' as before."
Qiu Mubai and the others exchanged glances, puzzled, but obeyed. "We understand, Senior!"
Chen Yan stood silently in the courtyard with her hands clasped behind her back.
Qin Sang and the other five waited beside her, observing their surroundings.
The courtyard was vast, overgrown with weeds. Towering ancient trees, each requiring more than a dozen people to encircle, grew along its edges, their age unknown.
At the other end were the ruins of a dilapidated palace, completely collapsed, leaving only broken walls that hinted at its former function.
The entire courtyard was a scene of desolation and decay.
