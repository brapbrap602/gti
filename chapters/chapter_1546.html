<h1>Chapter 1537: Zhulan Temple (4k)</h1><p>While traveling,</p><p>the Abbot heard that Qin Sang had come from afar, seemingly to discuss Buddhist doctrines with him.</p><p>The ultimate truths of the world, Buddhism and the Dao, are interconnected.</p><p>However, Buddhist debates have their own set of rules.</p><p>After entering the Western Desert, Qin Sang had studied the essence of Buddhism and could manage to cope. He disguised himself as a lay Buddhist devotee, not a wandering monk, and fabricated this explanation for that very reason.</p><p>After listening, Abbot Seng Yan understood that Qin Sang wasn't a true convert to Buddhism and wouldn't have excessively high expectations of him.</p><p>“Recently, I heard that a devotee has been worshipping Buddha in the vast desert, behaving with reverence.  I presume this must be Devotee Ming Yue,” Seng Yan inquired. “Since Devotee Ming Yue has repented and intends to eliminate karmic obstacles, why not choose a temple and convert to Buddhism?”</p><p>“This humble student worries about unresolved worldly affairs, fearing they would disturb a place of purity.”</p><p>Qin Sang replied respectfully.</p><p>Hearing this, Seng Yan imperceptibly shook his head, believing he had seen through Qin Sang's intentions.</p><p>This person's worship of Buddha and desire to eliminate karma was likely a pretense. The truth was he had encountered a bottleneck in his cultivation, his ascetic practices yielding no results, and he sought a breakthrough opportunity in Buddhism.</p><p>In the Desert Buddha Kingdom, countless followers did the same.</p><p>Such situations were common.</p><p>Some even shaved their heads and became monks, completely changing their affiliations and cultivating Buddhist techniques, while holding no genuine reverence for the Buddha in their hearts.</p><p>However, even among those true Buddhist masters, how many truly believed in the Buddha? Otherwise, why couldn't they even refute a brazen imposter claiming to be a 'Bodhisattva'?</p><p>If not for the fact that many Buddhist techniques and divine abilities could find validation in Buddhist scriptures, and even offer opportunities for advancement, they probably wouldn't even open the scriptures.</p><p>Seng Yan wished to change the Buddhist atmosphere but knew his own limitations.  Sighing inwardly, he didn't expose Qin Sang. "Devotee Ming Yue has traveled through the Three Thousand Buddha Kingdoms. What are your thoughts on that Moonlight Bodhisattva?"</p><p>As he spoke, Seng Yan subconsciously glanced at Qin Sang.</p><p>One Ming Yue (Bright Moon), one Moonlight. What a coincidence.</p><p>“This humble student dares not speak carelessly, but understands one principle.  Regardless of the Moonlight Bodhisattva's origins, since they understand Buddhist doctrines and comprehend Buddha-nature, they are a revered teacher, and this humble student admires them.”</p><p>Qin Sang tactfully replied.</p><p>Seng Yan was dumbfounded, standing rigidly for a while before snapping back to reality. He bowed deeply to Qin Sang. "I am grateful for Devotee Ming Yue's enlightenment.  This poor monk was fixated on appearances!"</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless. He wasn't interested in Seng Yan's thoughts and only wanted to steer the conversation towards Yin Chan Temple quickly.</p><p>With this move, Seng Yan became even more enthusiastic towards Qin Sang, even claiming that he possessed inherent Buddha-nature. "If Devotee Ming Yue is unwilling to be ordained, you might as well stay at the temple for a few days of cultivation.  This poor monk wishes to have a long conversation with you."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred. After feigning hesitation, he nodded in agreement.</p><p>For a period after this, Qin Sang continued as usual, leaving in the morning to visit various temples, meticulously burning incense and worshipping Buddha, returning to Bei Shan Temple in the evening.</p><p>Every evening when the lamps were lit, Abbot Seng Yan would come and discuss scriptures and Buddhist principles with him.</p><p>Seng Yan was a true believer, a rarity among the Buddhist cultivators Qin Sang had encountered recently.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang only intended to appease Seng Yan, waiting for the right moment to inquire about Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>After a few days, Qin Sang became increasingly interested, even beginning to diligently study the Buddhist scriptures.</p><p>Having achieved his current level of cultivation through unwavering determination, it was impossible for him to truly convert.  The reason was that he discovered that studying the scriptures seemed to benefit the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*.</p><p>He had already mastered the first four seals of the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*. Now, upon revisiting them, he realized there were many subtleties within the first four seals that he had overlooked.</p><p>The *Seven Masters Buddha Seal* was not simply a technique for killing; it was also aligned with Buddhist principles. The first four seals he had "mastered" echoed each other, and the order in which they were arranged also held hidden profound meaning.</p><p>For this reason, Qin Sang borrowed Bei Shan Temple's collection of Buddhist scriptures from Abbot Seng Yan and perused almost all of them.</p><p>He certainly hadn't forgotten his true mission.</p><p>After patiently laying the groundwork, he naturally steered the conversation towards Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>"While worshipping Buddha today, I happened to hear a secret from a master," Qin Sang said with a curious expression. "Many years ago, the vast desert was not bathed in Buddha's light. A virtuous eminent monk traveled here alone, establishing the first Buddhist temple, spreading the Dharma, and delivering sentient beings from suffering. I wonder which sacred temple it was?"</p><p>Hearing this, Seng Yan smiled. "The sacred temple Devotee Ming Yue speaks of is Yin Chan Temple. That virtuous eminent monk was Venerable Hong Yi. Yin Chan Temple is the present-day Zhulan Temple."</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. "Why the name change?"</p><p>Venerable Hong Yi was the eminent monk who left behind the Buddha Bone Relic.</p><p>This Venerable was not a Venerable of the Cang Lang Sea Merchant Alliance, but a Buddhist title for Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Zhulan Temple was the current leader of the Seven Stars of the vast desert and had inherited the lineage of Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>It was so simple, yet he hadn't discovered it before.</p><p>"It wasn't a name change."</p><p>Seng Yan shook his head. "Venerable Hong Yi's original Dharma name was Dao Yu. He cultivated at Zhulan Temple from a young age. After achieving a certain level of cultivation, he traveled extensively and witnessed the rampant demons in the vast desert. He made a great vow to help the people of the vast desert escape their suffering. The demonic forces were powerful, and Venerable Hong Yi worried about bringing disaster upon his sect, so he concealed his identity and built Yin Chan Temple. Later, as Venerable Hong Yi gained ground, Zhulan Temple happened to be pressured by powerful enemies and moved its monks to the vast desert."</p><p>Mentioning Venerable Hong Yi, Seng Yan didn't hide his admiration. "Venerable Hong Yi once said that merit lies in the heart and in action, not in empty fame. In his later years, he restored his original Dharma name, lived a simple life with scripture and lamp, until his passing. Only after the decline of Zhulan Temple's enemies was the name 'Zhulan Temple' restored, and a stupa was built within the temple for Venerable Hong Yi. Every ten years, Zhulan Temple holds a Dharma Assembly, initially to commemorate Venerable Hong Yi, but now it has become a place for disciples from various temples to compete with each other."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, thinking, "So that's how it is."</p><p>When Xiao Xiang Zi discovered the Buddha Bone Relic, Zhulan Temple was still called Yin Chan Temple.</p><p>Seng Yan was wrong about one thing. Venerable Hong Yi did not pass away peacefully.</p><p>Xiao Xiang Zi analyzed that Venerable Hong Yi likely encountered an accident while attempting to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, resulting in his death and the leaving behind of the Buddha Bone Relic.</p><p>Normally, even if Venerable Hong Yi failed his own breakthrough and left behind a special relic, it wouldn't be able to help others break through the same realm.</p><p>However, Xiao Xiang Zi discovered something unusual about the Buddha Bone Relic, suspecting that Venerable Hong Yi had used some kind of Buddhist treasure during his breakthrough. At the moment of his passing, the relic and the treasure unexpectedly fused, forming the unique Buddha Bone Relic.</p><p>This kind of relic was impossible to replicate.</p><p>Zhulan Temple built a stupa for Venerable Hong Yi.</p><p>Was the Buddha Bone Relic enshrined within the stupa?</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced inwardly, thinking he had finally found a clue.  He continued inquiring and learned that the next Dharma Assembly would be in two years. On the day of the Dharma Assembly, disciples from all temples could enter Zhulan Temple, possibly offering an opportunity to approach the stupa; it was the best time to observe.</p><p>He and Liuli had traveled from afar and didn't mind waiting two more years.</p><p>After learning this news, Qin Sang didn't stop worshipping Buddha, steadily progressing from one oasis to another, his demeanor remaining respectful.</p><p>One year later.</p><p>Qin Sang finally arrived at the largest oasis, where Zhulan Temple was located.</p><p>Zhulan Temple was built on the mountainside by a lake.</p><p>The temple complex was vast, serene, and majestic.</p><p>As expected, Zhulan Temple was not as lenient as Bei Shan Temple. Visiting monks could worship Buddha and stay temporarily, but they were only allowed to move about in the front temple. The back mountain was a forbidden area.</p><p>The stupa was built in the back mountain.</p><p>According to the information Qin Sang had gathered, Zhulan Temple had three Venerables.  Among them, Venerable Cheng Yuan was at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  This Venerable was in constant meditation and hadn't left Zhulan Temple for many years. Whether his cultivation had progressed further was unknown.</p><p>One mid-Nascent Soul and two early Nascent Soul cultivators. Qin Sang believed he and Liuli could handle them.</p><p>The most troublesome aspect was Zhulan Temple's protective spirit array.</p><p>When Qin Sang entered Zhulan Temple to worship Buddha, the spirit array was routinely activated. Even without unleashing its full power, he could sense the array's extraordinary nature.</p><p>Buddhist spirit arrays were very different from the formations he had learned at Yuan Shen Sect, particularly in their defensive capabilities.</p><p>The forbidden stupa area was located at the core of the spirit array.</p><p>How to infiltrate the forbidden area, obtain the Buddha Bone Relic, and escape unscathed while being besieged by three Venerables required careful planning.</p><p>If they couldn't retreat in time, they would face the combined attack of experts from various temples, both inside and outside!</p><p>After briefly observing Zhulan Temple's layout, Qin Sang returned to Bei Shan Temple, waiting for the opportune moment while diligently studying Buddhist scriptures.  His *Seven Masters Buddha Seal* showed noticeable improvement.</p><p>He didn't agree with Seng Yan's philosophy but held respect for everyone with unwavering beliefs, even though Seng Yan's cultivation was far inferior to his.</p><p>Without revealing himself, he would sometimes subtly offer guidance. Abbot Seng Yan wouldn't sense anything for now, but as his cultivation deepened, he would discover the profound meaning within.</p><p>The Dharma Assembly arrived as scheduled.</p><p>Zhulan Temple opened its doors wide, holding the Dharma Assembly in the back mountain, a good opportunity to approach the stupa.</p><p>Abbot Seng Yan disliked this kind of Dharma Assembly and ordered one of his junior brothers to lead the temple's true disciples to Zhulan Temple. Qin Sang secured the opportunity to join them.</p><p>The Dharma Assembly's procedures were quite complicated.</p><p>It was said that in the past, the Dharma Assembly consisted of two equally important parts: scriptural debate and combat. Various temples in the vast desert would offer treasures as rewards to encourage the winning disciples.</p><p>Later, combat became the focus, and scriptural debate was neglected due to its tediousness. Some even suggested abolishing it.</p><p>Qin Sang could understand these Buddhist disciples.</p><p>In the current era, achieving Deity Transformation was as difficult as ascending to heaven. It was a case of advance or perish.</p><p>How many dared to risk delaying their cultivation, diverting their attention to meticulously studying ethereal Buddhist doctrines?</p><p>The so-called karmic retribution, six paths of reincarnation, and pure land of Sukhavati mentioned in the scriptures were believed by mortals but doubted by cultivators.</p><p>Immortal ascension, at least, had legends.  These things only existed on the thin pages of Buddhist scriptures; there were no accounts of Buddha manifesting himself.</p><p>Those who could gain enlightenment from the scriptures and greatly advance their cultivation were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p><p>Frankly speaking, the cultivation of contemporary cultivators was too low, and the techniques and divine abilities they could access hadn't yet reached the level of profound doctrines.</p><p>Qin Sang, a dabbler who had superficially studied Buddhist scriptures for a few years, already had enough knowledge to comprehend the first four seals of the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*.</p><p>Of course, he couldn't cultivate the last three seals for the time being; that was a different matter.</p><p>Now, the turmoil caused by the Moonlight Bodhisattva was intensifying. This person possessed unparalleled debating skills, refuting countless so-called eminent monks. As long as this person's title of Bodhisattva wasn't removed, Buddhism would continue to lose face.</p><p>Therefore, this Dharma Assembly was different from previous ones. Scriptural debate received unprecedented attention.</p><p>The Dharma Assembly proceeded with great fanfare.</p><p>Qin Sang found an opportunity to slip away from the assembly hall and effortlessly located the stupa.</p><p>In the back mountain of Zhulan Temple, stupas stood like a forest, enshrining the remains of past eminent monks.</p><p>"Amitabha."</p><p>Just as Qin Sang approached the stupa forest, a monk appeared, blocking his path.</p><p>Judging by the monk's expression, he clearly wasn't allowing passage.</p><p>"Greetings, Master," Qin Sang calmly bowed and explained his purpose. "This humble student has learned of Venerable Hong Yi's virtuous deeds of spreading the Dharma single-handedly and feels deep respect. Hearing that there is a stupa built for Venerable Hong Yi in the stupa forest, I wish to burn incense and pay my respects before the stupa. I wonder if Master could grant me this convenience?"</p><p>Qin Sang observed his surroundings as he spoke.</p><p>Although the stupa forest was a sacred place within the temple, the guarding monk was only at the early Golden Core stage. This was because, unlike a true treasure vault, this place served more as a memorial.</p><p>However, this didn't mean it would be easy to succeed.</p><p>During the Dharma Assembly, the protective spirit array was at full power, and the stupa forest was heavily protected.</p><p>Standing outside, one could see the golden light radiating from the stupa forest, the tops of the stupas shining brightly with Buddhist light.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's respectful demeanor, which didn't seem feigned, the monk's expression softened slightly. In a gentle tone, he returned the bow. "This devotee is thoughtful. The stupa forest is a forbidden area and cannot be entered without the Abbot's decree. The devotee can burn incense and pay respects outside the stupa forest to show sincerity. That stupa over there was built for Venerable Dao Yu..."</p><p>Saying this, the monk turned and pointed towards a stupa in the center of the stupa forest.</p><p>Qin Sang had already awakened his Heavenly Eye Butterfly and scanned each stupa with his gaze.</p><p>The purpose of the stupas was to enshrine the relics of eminent monks within the temple.</p><p>Through the Buddhist light at the top of the stupas, he could see that some contained relics, while others held alms bowls, kasayas, prayer beads, and other personal belongings of the eminent monks.</p><p>Though mundane objects, they were imbued with extraordinary meaning.</p><p>Following the monk's finger, Qin Sang saw a white relic within the Buddhist light.</p><p>The relic was oval-shaped, pure white, and seemingly no different from other relics.</p><p>Zhulan Temple had enshrined this relic for many years without discovering its wonders. The naked eye couldn't discern anything special about it.</p><p>The color was right.</p><p>But to verify its authenticity, he had to hold it in his hand and use the secret technique taught by Xiao Xiang Zi.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered inwardly. Zhulan Temple wouldn't go to great lengths to replace a common relic with a fake, would they? Otherwise, wouldn't it lose the meaning of enshrinement?</p><p>He followed the monk to the incense burner in front of the stupa forest and completed the rituals, contemplating the possibility of making a move now and forcibly seizing the relic.</p><p>During the Dharma Assembly, Zhulan Temple was heavily guarded, with experts from various temples gathered together. He and Liuli were not fully prepared.</p><p>They only had one chance to act.</p><p>Once their purpose was exposed, Zhulan Temple's Venerables would realize the relic was a treasure.</p><p>After assessing the situation, Qin Sang felt that the chances of success this time were slim.</p><p>When he learned that the Venerables' meditation hall was located on the cliff face behind the stupa forest, Qin Sang completely abandoned the idea of acting now.</p><p>Even if he breached the array, he wouldn't be as fast as the three Venerables.</p><p>If the three Venerables acted together, they wouldn't need to defeat him. As long as they could cooperate with the spirit array to stall him for a moment and take away the offerings from the stupa forest, his efforts would be in vain.</p><p>Using the pretext of admiring Venerable Hong Yi's deeds, Qin Sang struck up a conversation with the monk, while secretly activating his Heavenly Eye divine ability to memorize the operational patterns of the protective spirit array, intending to analyze it further upon returning.</p><p>As the Dharma Assembly drew to a close,</p><p>Qin Sang left Zhulan Temple with the crowd and met with Liuli that night to explain the situation. </p>
