<h1>Chapter 492: Clash of Magical Treasures</h1><p>The dense Peach Blossom Miasma churned and roiled under the onslaught of the Flying Night Devil's surging deathly aura and Priest Jiupao's billowing demonic energy.</p><p>If someone were standing above the valley at this moment, they would see black plumes of energy rising from the depths of the pink miasma, growing more and more prominent.</p><p>Priest Jiupao's power, though not quite at the true Golden Core realm, was formidable.  The Flying Night Devil's speed and physical strength, usually significant advantages, were no longer as effective against him.  Previously, the Flying Night Devil's ability to appear and disappear at will had kept the Black Jiao serpent on the defensive, but that tactic wouldn't work against Priest Jiupao.  Qin Sang's goal wasn't simply to defeat the priest; he needed to keep him constantly engaged, denying him any chance to recover.  Thus, he commanded the Flying Night Devil to meet Priest Jiupao head-on.</p><p>The stone house was gone, reduced to rubble.</p><p>The entire space was filled with deathly and demonic energy, chillingly cold.</p><p>Priest Jiupao made several attempts to manipulate the surrounding spirit array, but Qin Sang easily saw through his intentions and countered them, rendering the powerful array useless.  Without anyone actively controlling it, the array, battered by the conflicting energies, began to crumble.</p><p>Amidst the raging chaos, even the remaining ruins of the stone house were obliterated, leaving a large crater in the ground.  Swathes of the surrounding peach trees were destroyed, leaving the valley scarred with broken branches and scattered blossoms.</p><p>Trapped within the swirling energies, Qin Sang felt vulnerable and adrift.  His senses were dulled, but thankfully, he could perceive Priest Jiupao's movements through the Flying Night Devil, ensuring he wouldn't be caught off guard.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A violent wind ripped through the battlefield.</p><p>Priest Jiupao roared in fury.</p><p>Within the surging demonic energy, a whirlwind suddenly erupted, like a black dragon, tearing through the deathly aura and smashing towards the Flying Night Devil with terrifying speed.</p><p>The whirlwind's power was frightening.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil vanished, dodging the attack just in time, but its offensive momentum faltered.</p><p>Just as it reappeared, preparing to renew its assault, an exceptionally powerful aura erupted from within the demonic energy.  An even darker, deeper energy than the demonic aura spread outwards, forming a black storm that threatened to engulf the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a flicker of recognition. Looking closer, he saw that the darkness within the demonic energy was actually black flames, concealed within the storm!</p><p>Anyone unaware of this would be caught completely off guard.</p><p>Nine Nether Demonic Fire!</p><p>Ten Yama Banners!</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.  He'd suspected as much.</p><p>Of the Yin Corpse Sect's five Ten Yama Banners, Priest Jiupao possessed one. It had been damaged during the Sect Master Yuan Zhao’s self-destruction at the Yuan Zhao Sect.</p><p>However, many years had passed, and Priest Jiupao had returned to the Yin Corpse Sect. He wasn’t completely destitute.  While his injuries might not have fully healed, repairing a magical treasure was likely within his capabilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated that Priest Jiupao would have a magical treasure.</p><p>He knew the terrifying power of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, especially its effectiveness against spirits – the Flying Night Devil's weakness. To kill Priest Jiupao, he had to disable the Ten Yama Banner first!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately ordered the Flying Night Devil to evade the flames and harass Priest Jiupao, while his mind and spirit entered his Nascent Soul space, secretly activating the Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>With a flash from his brow, the Ebony Wood Sword flew out, its light subdued, pointing remotely towards the depths of the demonic energy.</p><p>Qin Sang’s focus was razor-sharp, not solely on the Ten Yama Banner, but also on the surroundings.</p><p>Yu Hua had mentioned that Priest Jiupao only had two magical treasures, his lifebound treasure destroyed during Sect Master Yuan Zhao’s self-destruction.</p><p>Logically, a fugitive like Priest Jiupao, severely injured and constantly on the run, wouldn't have the resources or time to refine a new lifebound treasure. He should only have the Ten Yama Banner.</p><p>Indeed, Priest Jiupao hadn’t used any other treasures.</p><p>But there were always exceptions. Cultivators of this level were cunning and adept at deception.  Qin Sang himself often employed similar tactics.</p><p>He couldn’t afford to relax, lest he face utter destruction.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully probed, finding no trace of other treasures.  Meanwhile, the battle was shifting.</p><p>Empowered by the Ten Yama Banner, Priest Jiupao unleashed waves of demonic fire, forcing the Flying Night Devil into a defensive retreat.</p><p>Against the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the Flying Night Devil was hampered and its attacks were less effective.</p><p>Qin Sang commanded the Flying Night Devil to keep Priest Jiupao occupied while he secretly maneuvered the Ebony Wood Sword, cloaked in invisibility, closer to the priest.</p><p>This opportunity wouldn’t come again.  He couldn’t miss.</p><p>However, the pervasive demonic energy acted as Priest Jiupao's sensory extension. Even the Ebony Wood Sword's Shadowless Flight couldn't remain completely hidden. Before it could get close, Priest Jiupao sensed it.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>Priest Jiupao raged, flicking the banner and launching a stream of demonic fire towards the Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>An ordinary magical tool would likely be destroyed by the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>But the Ebony Wood Sword, also a magical treasure, wasn't afraid. Qin Sang, seeing this, hardened his resolve and directed the sword straight into the demonic flames!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Priest Jiupao’s expression froze.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword pierced through the Nine Nether Demonic Fire seemingly unscathed.  After a brief pause, it continued its flight towards him.</p><p>“A magical treasure?”</p><p>Priest Jiupao’s eyes widened in shock, but his sharp gaze quickly discerned the truth. Qin Sang’s cultivation was insufficient to fully utilize the treasure's power; he was relying on the material itself to resist the demonic fire.</p><p>In his hands, the treasure was wasted.</p><p>Priest Jiupao relaxed, sneering, "Leave that treasure for me!"</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>He unleashed several more bursts of demonic fire, forcing back the Flying Night Devil while he personally wielded the Ten Yama Banner against Qin Sang.</p><p>This was it!</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for this moment. His gaze sharpened as he silently chanted, "Thunderclap Sword Qi!"</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A blinding flash of lightning, like a heavenly thunderbolt, tore through the obscuring demonic energy.</p><p>“Thunderclap Sword Qi!”</p><p>As Priest Jiupao watched in astonishment, the Ebony Wood Sword closed the distance between them in an instant, appearing before him with a razor-sharp aura, aimed directly at his vital point.</p><p>Priest Jiupao hastily raised the Ten Yama Banner to block.</p><p>The massive banner crackled, erupting in demonic flames. The entire surface ignited, transforming into a blazing inferno. The power unleashed by the Ten Yama Banner in that instant made even Qin Sang’s heart tremble.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword hurtled forward.</p><p>Just as the two treasures were about to collide, a crimson glow enveloped the Ebony Wood Sword, spreading rapidly across its surface until it became a blood-red blade!</p>
