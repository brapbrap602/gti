<h1>Chapter 2087: Yonghe</h1><p>The light illuminated Min Zhuo's small frame, making him appear incredibly imposing in the eyes of the elders.  The elders were incredulous. They knew Min Zhuo had reached the bottleneck of the second stage of the Void Realm, but they never expected him to break through so quickly.  Furthermore, Min Zhuo directly activated the Sacred Lake Formation, clearly confident in this breakthrough attempt.</p><p>The elders were well aware of their clan leader's talent. They initially believed that the effectiveness of the Azure Spirit Qi would diminish later on, and that he might fail to break through the second stage of the Void Realm. No one was confident in his success.</p><p>It now seemed that the power of the Azure Spirit Qi remained potent, otherwise the clan leader wouldn't have broken through so swiftly. This meant that as long as they controlled the Azure Spirit Qi, they too might one day reach the second stage of the Void Realm!</p><p>Shock, elation…</p><p>Complex emotions surged within them, overwhelming them.</p><p>If the clan leader successfully broke through to the second stage of the Void Realm, they could easily defeat their centuries-old enemies, seize the Azure Spirit Qi for themselves, and the Changyou Clan's status would undergo a fundamental transformation.</p><p>The presence or absence of a second-stage Void Realm expert within the clan was a world of difference. Without one, they wouldn't even qualify to attend the Yuanjiao Sea Market, the greatest gathering of extraordinary individuals.</p><p>They fervently wished for the clan leader's success, hoping that the Changyou Clan would gradually rise to become a powerful clan. One elder even knelt before the ancestral hall, praying to their ancestors for protection.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Giant waves surged from the Sacred Lake, and the earth rumbled.</p><p>It was like a ground dragon turning, shattering the long-standing tranquility.</p><p>The clear lake water was thrown into the sky, and the resulting mist formed rainbows in the air, seeming like an auspicious omen.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>…</p><p>The waves grew larger and larger, flooding the shore.</p><p>In an instant, the buildings around the lake were submerged, and the water level continued to rise.</p><p>Simultaneously, the tremors from the lakebed intensified. Suddenly, a pillar of light shot up into the sky.  Blue light pillars erupted one after another, dyeing the sky a lake blue, creating a beautiful harmony between the lake and sky.</p><p>At the center of the Sacred Lake, around the ancestral hall, it remained calm, but the hall itself began to change. Its walls, tiles, and pillars became transparent, like pure jade.</p><p>The jade hall shone with a幽蓝光芒, and a wave of light rapidly expanded outward, sweeping across the entire lake surface.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Something at the base of the light pillars seemed to be activated, about to burst forth from the water. Min Shu and the elders felt an incredible pressure sweeping over them.</p><p>"The clan leader has activated the formation!  Quickly retreat!"</p><p>An elder shouted, and everyone scrambled to flee the Sacred Lake. The Sacred Lake surged with monstrous waves, chasing after them, sweeping across the land, engulfing the surrounding mountain range.</p><p>Changyou Clan cultivators who couldn't resist their curiosity and failed to evacuate in time were swept away by the waves, their fate unknown.</p><p>The elders felt the momentum of the waves behind them weaken, so they slowed their escape and looked back. Before them was a vast expanse of blue, a wall of water reaching the heavens, water flowing in the sky.</p><p>Through the curtain of water, they could vaguely see the scene within the Sacred Lake.  They saw numerous statues rising from what was once the lakeshore, each representing a member of the Changyou Clan, each with a different appearance and posture.</p><p>Bathed in the Sacred Lake's water, they radiated a divine light, seeming almost alive.</p><p>The elders were seeing the true Sacred Lake Formation for the first time. This formation protected the Sacred Lake and the ancestral hall and was only activated when the Changyou Clan faced a life-or-death struggle with invaders entering the Sacred Lake.</p><p>Because of an ancient pact and the will of the Zhuyan Clan, the various clans, despite their grievances, would never resort to destroying each other's ancestral halls.</p><p>They saw Clan Leader Min Zhuo descend from the sky, landing above the ancestral hall, sitting cross-legged in mid-air.</p><p>All the statues turned simultaneously to face Min Zhuo, gazing at him.</p><p>By this time, more and more water filled the sky, the current becoming increasingly dense, gradually obscuring the scene within.  Worried about disturbing the clan leader, the elders did not dare to use their spiritual vision, and could only wait anxiously outside.</p><p>Min Shu went to reassure the people, urging them to continue evacuating before returning to wait with the elders.</p><p>Days that once passed quickly during seclusion now felt unbearably long.</p><p>Unknowingly, half a year had passed, and there was still no movement from the Sacred Lake.  No one dared to leave, and they continued to watch.</p><p>One day, a strange fluctuation startled everyone. Soon, a terrifying pressure descended, causing everyone to shudder in fear.</p><p>"He succeeded!"</p><p>Someone whispered, but everyone remained tense.  Only after surviving the tribulation could they truly rest easy. They had not heard of the clan leader preparing any tribulation-conquering treasures.</p><p>They saw shadowy forms swirling within the water curtain, like ethereal flames.</p><p>“It’s the Yin Fire!”</p><p>Everyone instinctively retreated, their eyes filled with terror.</p><p>After an agonizing wait, a fierce wind erupted, clearly the arrival of the wind tribulation.  Thunder and lightning followed.</p><p>When the storm subsided, the sacred lake water remained suspended in mid-air.  The tribal leader hadn't emerged.</p><p>They exchanged uneasy glances, none daring to approach.</p><p>Inside the Sacred Lake.</p><p>Min Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, a deep wariness in their depths.  Only after a long moment did he confirm he was back in reality, having successfully overcome the Heart Demon Tribulation!</p><p>Recalling his ordeal, a chill ran down his spine, and he realized he was drenched in a cold sweat.</p><p>“It’s done.”</p><p>Min Zhuo looked at his hands, muttering to himself.</p><p>He could clearly feel the immense power of Heaven and Earth.  Before, he could only barely manipulate it; now, he could control it completely, capable of carving mountains into valleys or raising peaks from the lakebed in an instant.</p><p>“So this is the power of Empty Realm level two…”</p><p>Min Zhuo closed his eyes, carefully absorbing the feeling, lost in the experience.</p><p>He had imagined this countless times, but never in his wildest dreams did he expect to attain this power so quickly.  It still felt unreal.</p><p>Then, a sudden tremor shook Min Zhuo's composure.  This power wasn't achieved through his own arduous cultivation.  The mysterious person had not only given him the breakthrough elixir and secret techniques, but also a treasure to aid him in overcoming the tribulation. Without them, he would have perished under the heavenly tribulation!</p><p>Min Zhuo snapped out of his reverie. Instead of immediately consolidating his cultivation, he took out the orb the mysterious person had given him, stroking it before his expression hardened and he infused it with his true energy.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The orb exploded into a mist, forming hazy human-like shapes.</p><p>This time, the figures were clear to Min Zhuo.</p><p>However, as the figures appeared, Min Zhuo felt a sudden intuition. His sharp gaze shot towards the lake's edge, settling on a figure atop a mountain.</p><p>The person wore a golden dragon-embroidered yellow robe, with crimson hair and eyes, the latter seeming to burn like flames.</p><p>Facing the sacred lake, he bowed along with the figures in the mist, offering a congratulatory message: “Congratulations, Min Zhuo, on your breakthrough!”</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>Min Zhuo seemed to recognize him, his expression changing slightly as he instantly appeared before the man.</p><p>The man looked at Min Zhuo calmly, saying, “It’s always been me. You didn’t expect that, did you?”</p><p>Min Zhuo was incredulous. He truly hadn't expected the mysterious benefactor to be him.</p><p>This person's name was Zai Zhen, of the Yonghe clan. Only slightly older than Min Zhuo, they were practically peers. Zai Zhen had been a prodigy since youth, living up to expectations and reaching Empty Realm level two two hundred years ago.</p><p>In his younger days, Min Zhuo had traveled and encountered Zai Zhen several times. Later, the gap between them widened, and their already-shallow friendship faded, so Min Zhuo made no attempt to cultivate a closer relationship.</p><p>The Yonghe clan had always been stronger than the Changyou clan, occasionally producing an Empty Realm level two expert. However, thousands of years ago, the Yonghe clan suddenly declined until Zai Zhen's emergence halted the decline and signaled a potential resurgence.</p><p>Because of this, Min Zhuo didn't believe Zai Zhen's words.</p><p>Even at its height, the Yonghe clan likely couldn't have amassed so many rare treasures, let alone give them away. Besides, wouldn't it be better to keep such treasures for their own people?</p><p>“Brother Zai, do you think I'm so easily deceived?”</p><p>Min Zhuo frowned. “Even if the treasures came through you, someone else must be behind you, right?”</p><p>“You see through me, as expected.”</p><p>Zai Zhen readily admitted it, bowing slightly towards the sky. “There are only a few who could be behind this. You can probably guess who it is.  However, I cannot reveal their identity. I can only convey your wishes. Whether or not they will meet you is their decision.”</p><p>Min Zhuo frowned.  Among the nearby tribes, only the Zhu Yan and a few other powerful clans could easily produce such treasures.</p><p>He had initially suspected a foreign power, fearing detection by clans like the Zhu Yan, hence the clandestine actions.  Now, seeing that even Zai Zhen was willing to act for this person made it even more intriguing.</p><p>He was about to speak when Zai Zhen continued.</p><p>“However, since they wish to remain anonymous, I think you should avoid pressing the matter further.”</p><p>“Jade Yang Divine Milk, superior secret techniques, the Mind-Calming Gathering Essence Pill…”</p><p>Zai Zhen clicked his tongue in admiration.  “Back then, if I had obtained even one of these, my breakthrough wouldn't have been a life-or-death struggle.  Yet Min didn't even break a sweat! Remember, whoever has the power to give such treasures also has the power to take them back!”</p><p>“No need for Brother Zai’s reminder, I understand perfectly.”</p><p>Min Zhuo coldly snorted, not pursuing the identity of the benefactor, and asked in a low voice, “For such a great favor, I don't know how to repay. What does this person want me to do in return?”</p><p>“Brother Min is indeed straightforward!”</p><p>Zai Zhen smiled slightly. “The time is not yet right. What Brother Min needs to do now is to quickly close himself off and consolidate his cultivation, but don't let your guard down against those foreign tribes.”</p><p>“Is this benefactor targeting those foreign tribes? Or do they have a grudge against the powerful figures behind the tribes?”</p><p>Min Zhuo’s eyes flashed. He didn’t think those foreign tribes were worth the trouble for such a mysterious strong person; it must be related to the previous powerful demon beast experts.</p><p>Zai Zhen said solemnly, “Brother Min needn't ask. Once your cultivation is stable, send a message. I will explain what to do next.”</p><p>Min Zhuo nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>It seems the existence of Mount Taiyu hasn't been exposed yet; he still has a chance.</p><p>But besides him, some people among the foreign tribes also know about Mount Taiyu, though they don't know its origins. If those foreign tribes suffer a crushing defeat and someone captures them, the news might leak out, and the sacred mountain would be lost to him forever.</p><p>Ancient texts recording Mount Taiyu are rare, but certainly not exclusively held by the Changyou tribe.</p><p>For years, he has thoroughly investigated countless times. Before his breakthrough to the second level of the Void Realm, he lacked the strength to obtain Mount Taiyu.</p><p>Now he has the strength, but before the ebb of the miasma, he dare not act rashly. He must wait for the miasma to recede before he has a chance, and he must also conceal the disturbances caused by moving Mount Taiyu.</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to control it. Once a violent disturbance occurs, not only might it be noticed by experts from other tribes, but it might also alarm the powerful beasts deep within the miasma.</p><p>According to Min Zhuo's original plan, he still had ample lifespan.  A steady breakthrough would allow him to claim Mount Taiyu for himself.  Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned, and unexpected guests arrived, making the situation incredibly complicated.</p><p>He himself has become another's pawn.  While pawns aren't without room to maneuver, his people are here, and he cannot abandon them all and flee.</p><p>Min Zhuo felt constrained, sighing inwardly.</p><p>“Brother Min now has the power to protect himself, so I don't need to stay here,” Zai Zhen bowed slightly. “I’ve been away from the tribe for too long and should return.  I believe there will be good news from Brother Min soon.”</p><p>“Brother Zai, wait!”</p><p>Min Zhuo hurriedly stopped him. “I’ve just broken through; I’m no match for those established experts. And there’s more than one of them…”</p><p>“Brother Min, don’t worry, there will be help!”</p><p>Zai Zhen looked at him deeply, performed a hand gesture, and his figure instantly disappeared.</p><p>Min Zhuo sensed a deeper meaning in his words. Besides Zai Zhen, were there other helpers?</p><p>His heart settled slightly.  Looking at the empty mountaintop, he pondered for a long time before returning to the Sacred Lake.</p><p>The stone statue slowly sank to the bottom, the lake level receding.</p><p>The anxious elders rushed in.  Sensing the aura of their clan leader, they couldn't contain their joy and prostrated themselves.</p><p>“I have just broken through and need to close myself off. During this period, strictly seal the news, and let all clan affairs proceed as usual…”</p><p>Min Zhuo issued orders one by one.</p><p>An elder asked, “Clan leader, how should we deal with those foreign tribes…”</p><p>“Don't inform Min Shan for now. Send him a message, telling him to continue his previous plan and act as the situation dictates.”</p><p>Min Zhuo waved his sleeve and entered the ancestral hall.</p><p>Although the others were somewhat puzzled, they dared not disobey the clan leader's orders and only rose after the ancestral hall door closed.</p><p>…</p><p>Beyond the North Sea, behind the Changyou tribe's army.</p><p>On a certain island.</p><p>Min Shan, unaware of his clan leader's breakthrough, had various intelligence reports on his desk, pondering and strategizing his next moves.</p><p>In the quiet hall, Min Shan paced back and forth.  As he was pondering, he suddenly sensed a strange fluctuation.</p><p>His expression shifted, a look of expectation flashing in his eyes. He tapped a finger in the air, repeating a familiar technique. A strange current flowed along the ocean currents, silently passing through the army, arriving near a reef, and solidifying into a Min Shan's clone.</p><p>Simultaneously, a wisp of black mist rose from the cracks in the reef, transforming into a human form before him.</p><p>“Hmm?  Why is my friend so free to grace me with a visit this time?” Min Shan said amiably.</p><p>For years, the other party had repeatedly delivered true and useful information, and their cooperation had been very pleasant.</p>
