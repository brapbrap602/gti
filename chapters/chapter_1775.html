<h1>Chapter 1766 Refining the Void</h1><p>The most magnificent mansion in the Demon City was Marquis Liu's estate.</p><p>Within the estate, a chilling air of肃杀 (grim anticipation) prevailed.</p><p>Following Marquis Liu's orders, the generals and commanders under his command methodically deployed the demon troops, dispatching them company by company.</p><p>At this moment, all of Marquis Liu's forces were mobilized, which coincidentally left his estate at its most vulnerable.</p><p>And at this very moment, above a black stone hall within the estate's forbidden grounds, a figure abruptly appeared.</p><p>By the time the demon guards noticed this person, a world-shaking sword light descended from the heavens.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword light cascaded down, striking the stone hall directly.</p><p>The protective formations of the stone hall shattered instantly. The demon guards could only watch helplessly as the sword light cleaved through the protective barrier and plunged straight into the hall.</p><p>A sword scar appeared in the center of the stone hall, splitting it in two. The ensuing shockwave caused the hall to collapse, sending debris flying in all directions.</p><p>This sword strike was too fast, too sharp. The demon guards had no time to react.</p><p>All the demon guards were stunned.</p><p>This stone hall was not only the forbidden ground of the estate but also its treasury, where all the treasures of Marquis Liu's fiefdom were stored.</p><p>Without Marquis Liu's permission, not even Commander Ying dared to trespass. Yet, at this moment, it was cleaved open by a single sword strike!</p><p>Dust and smoke billowed from the ruins. The person who had unleashed that sword strike was nowhere to be seen, evidently having already entered the treasury.</p><p>Thinking of the terrifying consequences of the treasury being plundered, the demon guards were overcome with terror. Their eyes bloodshot, they charged towards the stone hall, roaring furiously.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The fastest demon guards had just reached the ruins when—</p><p>Suddenly, a white light flashed. Another sword beam, like a bolt of lightning, pierced through the dust and smoke, passing right by the demon guards.</p><p>These demon guards instantly froze, collapsing to the ground. Their bodies shattered into several pieces, their lives extinguished in an instant.</p><p>No one could clearly see how that sword light had slain these demon guards. The remaining guards involuntarily hesitated.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The Marquis' estate trembled violently. The sword light burst forth, transforming into a startling rainbow and soaring away.</p><p>…</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang was moving south according to his plan.</p><p>Traveling swiftly, Qin Sang encountered an increasing number of demon troops, causing him to marvel inwardly at Marquis Liu’s military might.</p><p>This was merely the fiefdom of a single Demon Marquis. No wonder the Ghost Fang Kingdom had been able to contend with the Dao Court for so long without falling behind.</p><p>He hadn't encountered any formidable opponents along the way, and the demon troops' objective was clear: they were all heading northwest.</p><p>Based on this, he was moving away from the chaotic vortex and shouldn't be affected.</p><p>Qin Sang gradually relaxed, secretly speculating about what major event had occurred in the Ghost Fang Kingdom. Unfortunately, the information he had obtained was too limited to deduce anything, so he stopped wasting his energy.</p><p>Gradually, the demon troops Qin Sang encountered became noticeably sparser.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang believed he was safe, the Skyeye Butterfly suddenly sent a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. He flashed to the highest peak nearby and looked towards the horizon.</p><p>He saw a magnificent expanse of rosy clouds in the east.</p><p>Amidst the rosy clouds, a white rainbow was streaking across the sky.</p><p>This was clearly an escaping light. The opponent's speed was astonishing, faster than a shooting star. Even before the escaping light arrived, Qin Sang could sense the surging, overwhelming aura emanating from the other party.</p><p>“Nascent Soul cultivator!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>He didn't detect a monstrous demonic aura from the other party, indicating that it was likely a human cultivator.</p><p>Moreover, judging by the direction of their movement, they were heading straight towards him.</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically as he immediately thought of something.</p><p>Could this person be the one who caused havoc in Marquis Liu's fiefdom?</p><p>This person, pursued by countless demon troops, had actually broken out of the encirclement.</p><p>Qin Sang had deliberately headed south to avoid the storm.  He hadn’t expected such an unforeseen turn of events, ending up right in the thick of it. He couldn’t help but feel annoyed.</p><p>The situation didn't allow him much time to think.</p><p>A thought immediately arose in Qin Sang's mind: he absolutely couldn't be exposed!</p><p>The escaping light's movement had created a tremendous commotion, and the demon troops would certainly be attracted.</p><p>Behind this escaping light, a dark cloud was faintly rolling in, possibly the enemies pursuing him.</p><p>It was almost certain that the newcomer was a Demon Marquis!</p><p>At this moment, this place was the eye of the storm. Once exposed, he would inevitably be considered an accomplice of this person.</p><p>The Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom were bitter enemies. Qin Sang didn't expect any mercy from a Demon Marquis.</p><p>Fighting a Demon Marquis in the Ghost Fang Kingdom was by no means a wise move. Even at his peak, Qin Sang wouldn't take action without absolute certainty.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang didn’t even know what this person had done to attract the pursuit of several Demon Marquises.</p><p>“The enemy's attention is on this person. If I conceal myself with all my might, I should be able to slip through unnoticed…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>It was too late to escape now. The escaping light was rapidly approaching.</p><p>The Wood Spirit Body excelled at agile and unpredictable movements amidst vegetation, but its escaping speed was ordinary.</p><p>Remaining still, merging with the vegetation, was the easiest way to conceal himself.</p><p>Thoughts racing, Qin Sang immediately left the mountaintop. He rapidly leaped several times through the forest, avoiding the path of the incoming escaping light, and appeared in a secluded, low-lying valley.  He merged his body with an ancient tree, instantly becoming silent and still.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>White light, like a rainbow, pierced through the air and arrived.</p><p>Suddenly, the white light dimmed and paused mid-air, transforming into sword light that descended from the sky and landed on a peak, revealing a Daoist.</p><p>A spiritual sword circled around him.</p><p>The Daoist’s breathing was somewhat labored, and his robes were slightly wrinkled, as if he had just experienced a fierce battle.</p><p>He glanced back, seeing the rolling black clouds behind him, his face darkening further.  He let out a turbid breath and took out a porcelain bottle, pouring out a jade-white pill.</p><p>The Daoist swallowed the pill and was just about to circulate his Qi to refine it when his body stiffened slightly, his eyes flashing with a sharp light.</p><p>“Who!”</p><p>As he shouted, his spiritual sword trembled, and the sword shot out like a dragon!</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>With a single swing, the Daoist unleashed three thousand-foot sword energies, targeting an inconspicuous valley.</p><p>The valley was lush with vegetation, its dense canopy forming a green carpet that covered the entire area, leaving no gaps.</p><p>At this moment, the valley wasn't quiet. Insects and beasts, frightened by the terrifying pressure, were in a state of panic.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>As the sword energies descended, the vegetation in the valley was instantly shredded, countless wood chips flying, leaving a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, a metallic clang rang out.  The sword energy in the center dispersed upon impact, as if it had struck something incredibly hard.</p><p>From the debris, Qin Sang was forced to reveal himself, his gaze as dark as water.</p><p>He hadn't expected this person to stop here to take medicine, nor had he expected this person's spiritual sense to be so acute, attacking without warning.</p><p>Even the Wood Spirit Body couldn't escape this person's perception and was forced out by a single sword strike.</p><p>The Daoist raised his sword, about to strike again, when he saw Qin Sang in his tree form.</p><p>Qin Sang also saw the other party's appearance clearly.</p><p>Their eyes met, both stunned.</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>The Daoist recognized Qin Sang at a glance. After all, this Wood Spirit Body was too unique.</p><p>Seemingly oblivious to Qin Sang's gloomy gaze, the Daoist recalled his spiritual sword and said joyfully, “What a coincidence! Fellow Daoist showed mercy that day, and I've always been grateful.  I've been preoccupied with matters and haven't had the chance to visit Immortal City, but I never expected to meet Fellow Daoist again.”</p><p>“Indeed, it's quite a coincidence!”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Daoist with a grim expression.</p><p>The Daoist was the very same sword cultivator he had encountered in Star Valley!</p><p>Since arriving in Ju Mountain to treat Crane Cry Mountain, Qin Sang had only left the city twice, and both times he had encountered this person.</p><p>Even excluding the boundless孽原 (karmic wasteland) and孽海 (karmic sea), the Two Mountains and Two Regions were vast and boundless. What were the odds of such a coincidence?</p><p>This encounter was even more absurd.</p><p>He had received a decree from the Dao Court, traveled a long distance, infiltrated the Ghost Fang Kingdom to gather medicinal herbs, and yet he still encountered this Daoist even when he wasn't in Ju Mountain!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's expression and scanning the surrounding terrain, the Daoist seemed to understand and apologized, "I thought the one hiding in the shadows was a demon waiting to ambush me.  I didn't expect…"</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang glanced behind the Daoist.</p><p>There, the black clouds were churning, and the imposing aura of a Nascent Soul stage Great Demon was fully revealed. The black clouds showed no sign of stopping.</p><p>Now wasn't the time to bicker with the Daoist. Qin Sang remained silent, withdrawing his Wood Spirit Body with a flicker. Lightning crackled around him as he spread his wings, instantly transforming into a bolt of lightning and escaping.</p><p>At this time, the Daoist, having mostly refined the pill, hurriedly summoned his sword light and followed closely.</p><p>Qin Sang shot a cold glance at the Daoist. He needed to understand the situation first. Reason kept him from unleashing a sword strike.</p><p>Their situation was extremely precarious, and it was largely the Daoist's fault.</p><p>If he hadn't been exposed and had remained hidden, cooperating with the Daoist, they might have had a chance to slay this Demon Marquis.</p><p>But his strength hadn’t fully recovered, and the only means he had that could threaten a Nascent Soul cultivator were extremely taxing. The Daoist also seemed to have gone through many battles and wasn't in peak condition either.</p><p>In a direct confrontation, given their current states, even if they joined forces, they would be locked in a protracted battle.</p><p>"I apologize for dragging Fellow Daoist into this," the Daoist said sincerely. "Since the situation has come to this, we must first find a way to escape this danger. This place is teeming with demons, and there's more than one Demon Marquis pursuing me.  The demon kingdoms near the Ghost Fang Kingdom have likely received orders, so the path ahead is also perilous. However, I've prepared an escape route.  If we work together, we can definitely escape!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned deeply.  What exactly had this Daoist done to attract so many Demon Marquises?</p><p>He knew the Daoist wasn't trying to scare him.</p><p>The decree had listed information about Marquis Liu.  Marquis Liu was a Lightwing Bird that had attained Dao. This black cloud was clearly not Marquis Liu’s divine ability.</p><p>This meant there were at least two Demon Marquises here!</p><p>The Daoist confirmed that there were even more. When he escaped, he was besieged by two Demon Marquises besides Marquis Liu. One of them possessed extraordinary innate escaping techniques.  The Daoist had risked mutual destruction to severely injure this demon, thus gaining a chance to breathe.</p><p>Once that Demon Marquis suppressed its injuries, it would quickly catch up.</p><p>This Demon Marquis behind them was also very cunning, keeping a distance, waiting for its companions to arrive.</p><p>If he were at his peak, Qin Sang could have a chance to shake off his pursuers by using his Lightning Escape with all his might.</p><p>Unfortunately…</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Daoist, neither agreeing nor disagreeing with his words.  He said coldly, "You dared to cause such chaos in a Demon Marquis' fiefdom. Did you not anticipate being besieged?"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that even in this situation, the Daoist didn't seem anxious.</p><p>If the Daoist had exhausted all his options, Qin Sang would find a way to escape alone and definitely wouldn't die with him.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist has sharp eyes. I indeed have one or two last resorts prepared, but they are not easily employed. I thought I might have to fight to the death today, but unexpectedly, I encountered Fellow Daoist..."</p><p>As he spoke, the Daoist glanced at their pursuers, his tone turning cold.  "I was just about to ask for Fellow Daoist's opinion on whether we should join forces and slay this demon! Bringing a Demon Marquis's corpse back to the Dao Court would be a great merit!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p>Did this Daoist enjoy taking risks so much?</p><p>He pondered. He did possess the means to threaten a Demon Marquis, but none of them came without a great cost. Even if they could slay this demon, what if they encountered another powerful enemy later?</p><p>He had only met the Daoist twice, and both times they had clashed, albeit due to misunderstandings. Qin Sang couldn't completely trust him.</p><p>He hadn't forgotten that the goal of this trip was to retrieve the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flower.</p><p>His own breakthrough was paramount. There would be plenty of opportunities in the future. Why take such a risk?</p><p>Qin Sang firmly refused.</p><p>The Daoist couldn't help but admire, "Fellow Daoist is indeed cautious! In that case, let's find a way to scare this demon away."</p><p>As they spoke, they had flown over countless mountains and rivers, spotting demon troops ahead, seemingly planning to intercept them.</p><p>The Daoist transmitted his voice. Qin Sang's expression showed surprise. After pondering for a moment, he agreed.</p><p>Soon, both of them descended from their escaping lights.</p><p>Below was a vast jungle. As the wind swept past, the sea of trees rippled with layers of green waves.</p><p>The two figures plunged into the forest and disappeared.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the black cloud arrived, and a majestic black-spotted leopard demon stood atop the cloud.</p><p>At this moment, the Daoist sat cross-legged beneath a tree, his spiritual sword suspended upside down before his chest.  The sword’s body trembled slightly, as if resonating with something.</p><p>The Daoist's eyes were tightly closed, oblivious to the outside world.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beside the Daoist, observing this scene with some surprise. The Daoist had focused all his attention on controlling his sword, leaving everything else to him.  Wasn't he worried that Qin Sang might have malicious intentions?</p><p>However, since Qin Sang had made a promise, he wouldn't betray his word. He glanced upwards and raised his palm.</p><p>In his hand was a palm-sized, archaic bronze bell with distinct octagonal sides, slightly translucent.</p><p>This was because the bell wasn't a physical object but a talisman given to him by the Daoist.</p><p>Judging by the Daoist’s tone, he had great confidence in this talisman. Most importantly, this talisman could be activated purely with blood essence.</p><p>Just then, the black-spotted leopard demon opened its mouth and spewed a stream of black flames, setting the jungle below ablaze.</p><p>The raging black flames surrounded the two, and under the cover of the roaring fire, an extremely fine black light, as thin as a thread, stealthily attacked them.</p><p>Although the black light was concealed, it couldn't escape the Skyeye Butterfly's sight.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly activated the bronze bell, while remaining vigilant.</p><p>The bronze bell flew high into the air and instantly transformed into a giant bell, covering both of them beneath it.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>Amidst the earth-shattering ringing, the giant bell vibrated violently. The fine black light possessed an unbelievably powerful force.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, his face flushing, inwardly astonished by the power of this talisman. He steadily withstood the Demon Marquis’s attack.</p><p>However, Qin Sang sensed that the talisman's power wouldn't last long, and no matter how much blood essence he infused, he couldn't stop it from dissipating.</p><p>The black-spotted leopard demon saw through the bronze bell's nature.  It snorted coldly, a glint of malice flashing in its eyes, and suddenly retracted the black flames, the scorching flames burning the bronze bell.</p><p>The talisman’s power rapidly dispersed.</p><p>However, this time was enough.</p><p>The Daoist abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp like two swords. The spiritual sword hummed and shot out.</p><p>The sword light was dazzling, causing the world to lose its color.</p><p>Wherever it passed, the surrounding Yuan Qi violently churned.</p><p>It wasn't just a simple stirring.</p><p>The surrounding Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi seemed to be drawn by some force, converging madly towards the spiritual sword. The sword light instantly expanded countless times, its terrifying power causing both Qin Sang and the leopard demon to tremble in fear.</p><p>This sword strike seemed to have severed them from the world itself.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes shone with astonishment. The technique the Daoist displayed at this moment was like that of a legendary Void Refining cultivator, capable of manipulating the Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi!</p><p>The black-spotted leopard demon was even more incredulous, crying out in shock, "Grand True One?"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
