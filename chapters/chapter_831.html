<h1>Chapter 823: External Avatar</h1><p>As the man had said, Qin Sang encountered several patrol squads along the way.</p><p>Sensing danger, he proceeded cautiously, bypassing them until he finally left the Broken Wind Islands.  He remained vigilant even after leaving the southwestern sea region, only then releasing his Two-Headed Hound.</p><p>…</p><p>Azure sea, blue sky.</p><p>High noon, the scorching sun hung overhead.</p><p>Not a single cloud dotted the sky, nor a breath of wind stirred the surface of the sea.  The air was stiflingly hot.</p><p>A lone dragon-headed ship sailed across the waters.  Its prow was secured with ropes tethering tamed sea beasts. Though not demonic beasts, they were enormous and imposing, cleaving the waves and propelling the ship forward at high speed.</p><p>Compared to the vastness of the ocean, the ship appeared minuscule.</p><p>Its hold was filled with cargo, and the deck bustled with the activity of mortal crew members.</p><p>With the sea so calm, they grumbled amongst themselves about the oppressive heat, yet none dared to speak too loudly, their eyes darting nervously towards the cabin with expressions of awe.</p><p>All seemed peaceful.</p><p>Suddenly, the ship lurched violently.</p><p>The crew cried out in alarm, stumbling and falling, realizing that one of the sea beasts pulling the ship was thrashing wildly, attempting to break free from its restraints.</p><p>The beast, several meters long and immensely strong, caused the ship to rock precariously.</p><p>These creatures had been tamed from a young age, serving faithfully without incident until now.  The reason for its sudden frenzy was a mystery.</p><p>Confused and clinging to anything within reach, the crew watched the cargo shift dangerously and shouted for help.</p><p>The ship's captain rushed out from the cabin, yelling, "Quick! See what's happening!  Blow the conch to calm them!"</p><p>Crew members scrambled to the bow. One of them produced a conch shell and blew into it with all his might.</p><p>The conch was a tool for controlling the beasts.  In the past, its sound had always soothed them when they grew agitated.  This time, however, it had no effect. The beast seemed deaf to the sound, roaring in apparent terror.</p><p>Moreover, the other beasts began to show signs of unrest as well.</p><p>Chaos threatened to erupt.</p><p>Just as the captain's anxiety peaked, several streaks of light shot out from the cabin and landed on the bow, revealing five figures of distinguished bearing.</p><p>"Immortal Masters! The sea beasts are agitated. Can you help subdue them?"</p><p>The captain, seeing his saviors, rushed to their side.  He was surprised to find all five staring intently at the empty sea, as if searching for something.</p><p>He followed their gaze but saw nothing.</p><p>"Cut the ropes!" the eldest, a middle-aged Immortal Master, barked suddenly.</p><p>The captain, bewildered but startled by the intensity in the Immortal Master's eyes, felt a jolt of fear. Sensing something amiss, he immediately relayed the order, "Quick! Do as the Immortal Master says!"</p><p>*Thud* *Thud* *Thud*…</p><p>One by one, the ropes were severed.</p><p>The now-frenzied beasts had strained against the tight ropes, which snapped with loud reports, finally setting them free.  They scattered at once.</p><p>The captain's heart sank.</p><p>His distress over the loss of the beasts was quickly eclipsed by terror.</p><p>The beast that had fled first had not gone far when a flurry of bubbles erupted on the water's surface ahead. The beast was then dragged beneath the waves with tremendous force, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>A moment later, crimson blood welled up, staining a large patch of the sea a shocking red.</p><p>Then, another beast disappeared.</p><p>Such massive creatures, devoured without so much as a ripple, by some unseen horror lurking below.  The crew was petrified.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's expression darkened.  "It's a demonic beast, a Bluefin Shark! Turn back, head back!" he exclaimed.</p><p>The captain paled. "A demonic beast… How could such a powerful beast be here…?"</p><p>The ship turned and fled.</p><p>Behind them, the remaining beasts met the same fate, hunted down one by one.  The Bluefin Shark never fully surfaced, yet the sea was painted red with blood, a gruesome spectacle.</p><p>Their brief respite ended as they noticed a dense cluster of bubbles rising rapidly behind them.</p><p>Panic gripped everyone, cultivators included.  Only the middle-aged cultivator maintained his composure.  "Don't panic! We can't just wait to be killed! Form a defensive formation!" he commanded.</p><p>The other four, faces etched with fear, scrambled to form a rudimentary battle array.</p><p>Each one summoned their magical weapons, awaiting the middle-aged cultivator’s command.  At his shout of "Attack!", they unleashed their weapons towards the bubbling water.</p><p>Beams of light, each a different color, shot into the sea, striking the heart of the bubbling zone.</p><p>They hoped to kill the beast or drive it away.</p><p>Instead, the bubbling intensified, and a terrifying dark shape slowly ascended from the depths.  As the horrified crew watched, the Bluefin Shark emerged. It bore several wounds, but they were superficial, not life-threatening. The attack seemed only to have enraged it.</p><p>“No! Dodge!”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator yelled, but it was too late.</p><p>The Bluefin Shark opened its massive jaws and spewed forth a torrent of water that transformed into a barrage of water arrows, hurtling towards the people on the bow.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator used his weapon to shield himself, but the others reacted too slowly.</p><p>One young man was struck in the abdomen by a water arrow, a gaping hole torn through his body. He fell into the sea, lifeless.</p><p>“Xiao Ning!”</p><p>Cries of despair echoed as the remaining survivors succumbed to hopelessness.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the distance, a young man rode a two-headed beast, his eyes closed, cultivating with a spirit stone clutched in his hand.</p><p>This was Qin Sang, having journeyed a long way.</p><p>He sensed the commotion in the distance, roused from his meditation. “This is close to Tianxing Island. The nearby islands are densely populated, the most prosperous area for humans. Major demonic beasts have been eliminated or driven to remote waters, but some inevitably slip through the net. It seems someone has died.  My demonic seed has finally matured. I can find a body and refine my external avatar…"</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang patted the Two-Headed Hound, directing it to change course.</p><p>He had left Tianxing Island years ago for the Broken Wind Islands, the demonic seed within him gestating until it finally matured recently. Now he was ready to create his external avatar.</p><p>The requirements for the body were not stringent; a low-level cultivator would suffice. The avatar’s cultivation speed would depend on his own.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang spotted a battered ship being pursued by a Bluefin Shark.</p><p>Only two low-level cultivators were still holding out, but their situation was dire.</p><p>The Bluefin Shark, clearly far stronger, was toying with them.  A dozen corpses floated on the sea, ignored by the beast.</p><p>Qin Sang located the body of a young cultivator.</p><p>He recalled his Two-Headed Hound and, cloaked in invisibility, darted onto the Bluefin Shark's back. With a single press of his hand, he subdued the beast, forcing it to dive.</p><p>After killing the shark, Qin Sang approached the young man’s body, confirming his death before transferring the demonic seed into him.</p>
