<h1>Chapter 1839: What is a God?</h1><p>A sword’s hum seemed to originate from Qin Sang’s heart, causing him to tremble. He immediately retreated to a safe place and calmed his mind.</p><p>Inside his Purple Mansion.</p><p>His Yuanshen wore the Yin-Yang armor, concealing the Buddha light.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly shifted his thoughts, removing the Yin-Yang armor. Buddha light filled the space, along with a sword glow!</p><p>Then a small, crystal-clear sword emerged from his Yuanshen, circling briefly in the Purple Mansion before flying out from his brow!</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, gazing at the spiritual sword, filled with emotion.</p><p>“Old friend, long time no see!”</p><p>The Yunyou Sword seemed to sense Qin Sang’s thoughts, hovering before him, its body trembling slightly, emitting a buzzing hum, full of spiritual energy!</p><p>His mind connected with the spiritual sword. Qin Sang carefully sensed it, murmuring, “This is… the spiritual embryo…”</p><p>The Yunyou Sword had clearly reached the level of a spiritual treasure, directly bypassing the pseudo-spiritual treasure stage, giving birth to a spiritual embryo.</p><p>From the ‘spiritual embryo,’ Qin Sang sensed a familiar aura.</p><p>The true spirit of the Jiao wood, the remnant true spirit of Yunyouzi, had nurtured this embryo.</p><p>The formation of a spiritual embryo is the prerequisite for becoming a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Although the Yunyou Sword had been dormant for hundreds of years, for a spiritual treasure, the time was still not long enough. If it weren't for that trace of true spirit, it would have taken even longer.  After all, his previous cultivation was low, his knowledge insufficient, offering almost no help; it simply nurtured naturally.</p><p>The treasures Qin Sang possessed—the gauntlets fused with the deer antler-forged palm sword, and the Mingshan armor imbued with fragments of true treasure—might surpass some spiritual treasures in certain aspects, but none had formed a spiritual embryo.</p><p>The palm sword was merely a pseudo-spiritual treasure.</p><p>The Mingshan armor didn’t even possess spirituality; its unique nature, forged from special materials, could only be considered a magic treasure.</p><p>Their power wasn't weak, but their potential couldn't compare to true spiritual treasures.</p><p>Nurturing spirituality is an untold secret in the art of refining weapons.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned some of the true techniques from Master Gu, but still didn’t understand how to quickly nurture spirituality.</p><p>Possessing a spiritual embryo meant the Yunyou Sword had the potential for further transformation, to give birth to a weapon spirit and become a post-heaven spiritual treasure!</p><p>“A weapon spirit…”</p><p>Qin Sang understood this step was still far away, but he couldn't help but anticipate.  If the Yunyou Sword developed a weapon spirit, could Yunyouzi awaken?</p><p>He hadn't used his natal spiritual sword for hundreds of years, solely to protect Yunyouzi's true spirit, hoping for their reunion.</p><p>The cold sword light illuminated Qin Sang’s face. He seemed to be reminiscing, his expression tinged with melancholy.</p><p>‘Buzz…buzz…’</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts were interrupted by the spiritual sword.</p><p>“From now on, you’ll fight alongside me again!” Qin Sang whispered.</p><p>Instantly, the sword light intensified.  A soaring sword intent accompanied a clear sword hum as it leaped into the air. The sword tip turned, targeting the illusion that had just forced Qin Sang back, and slashed through the air.</p><p>Sword energy like a rainbow smashed open the gateway!</p><p>Qin Sang’s clothes billowed as he stepped inside.</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Jushan Prefecture, Star Island Fairy Lake, a deserted island in the north.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a reef, surrounded by a formation, summoning a furnace.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede flew out of the furnace, landing in Qin Sang’s palm, swallowing the last Qing Frost Pill.</p><p>“Success or failure rests on this!”</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped his forehead, his essence blood transforming into a blood seal, flying into the flames on the Fire Jade Centipede’s body, then melting away.</p><p>The next moment, the blood seal spread beneath the Fire Jade Centipede, forming a complex diagram out of thin air.  Each thread of the diagram was made of blood, all of Qin Sang’s essence blood.</p><p>Blood energy filled the air. The flames on the Fire Jade Centipede, and its body itself, gradually turned blood-red, becoming a blood centipede.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede then coiled into a ball, enduring the pain of the pill’s power.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored it for now, concentrating on perfecting the seal array. This was a secret technique recorded in the *Panhu True Scripture*. It couldn’t directly increase the chances of the Fire Jade Centipede’s breakthrough, but it could stimulate the essence blood energy it had absorbed over this time, paving the way for it.</p><p>With the two Qing Frost Pills as a foundation, this was already Qin Sang’s maximum support.</p><p>The seal array was complete!</p><p>Blinding blood light was blocked by the outer formation.</p><p>Within the blood light, the Fire Jade Centipede let out a shrill cry, soaring into the air, like a blood dragon swimming.</p><p>Qin Sang gently exhaled, stopping his movements, staring at the Fire Jade Centipede, waiting for the moment of breakthrough.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Blood fire filled the air, constantly howling.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede’s aura violently fluctuated, then transformed into a momentum, launching an assault on the bottleneck to the higher realm.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious. He felt the fire jade centipede's intense desire to break through, and also the immense difficulty of the challenge.  After all, the fire jade centipede's potential was inferior to the celestial eye butterfly, and it hadn't undergone any mutation.  For such a spirit insect to forcibly trigger a fifth molt was extremely rare, and even if successful, its future path would be arduous unless it encountered further fortuitous circumstances.</p><p>Its hissing grew sharper.  The fire jade centipede's body tensed, launching itself skyward like an arrow released from a bowstring. Its aura surged dramatically at that moment.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively stood, his pupils contracting slightly as he sighed softly.</p><p>That explosive surge of energy, at the moment of its peak, abruptly subsided. The fire jade centipede froze mid-air, unable to continue its ascent.</p><p>Its shrill cries echoed through the high heavens as it circled relentlessly, filled with boundless frustration.</p><p>Qin Sang empathized with this frustration, having experienced something similar himself.  With a sigh, he gently beckoned.</p><p>The fire jade centipede slowly descended into his palm, remaining prostrate, like a child who had misbehaved.</p><p>"You still have a long time ahead…" Qin Sang murmured. Spirit insects didn't face a forty-nine day tribulation; they had opportunities until their lifespans ended.</p><p>However, he couldn't dedicate more energy to the fire jade centipede in the near future.</p><p>His three Frost Jade Pills were gone.  The accumulated effects of the pills had dissipated; even more pills wouldn't yield better results than this time.  He could only wait for the fire jade centipede's own stroke of luck.</p><p>His own progress had been meteoric, but the fire jade centipede had stagnated, unable to keep pace.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of loss, but he was also prepared.  As he continued to advance, some companions would inevitably be left behind.</p><p>Like the East Sun Princess to him, like him to his senior sister Qing Jun.</p><p>Whether they could catch up, whether they would meet again someday, or if they were forever separated—it was a question of fate.</p><p>The fire jade centipede had simply been following him for a longer period.</p><p>Stowing the fire jade centipede in his spirit-beast pouch, Qin Sang dismantled his setup on the islet and flew towards Sword Heart Island.</p><p>He paid his respects to the Sword Master on Sword Heart Island, discussing sword techniques, and inquired about recent developments before leaving Star Lake Isle to visit Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Upon seeing Mo Xingdao again, a significant change was apparent. His features were lively, his eyes bright, indistinguishable from a normal person.  It was nearly impossible to discern his puppet body with the naked eye.</p><p>"Thanks to the spirit objects you provided, I have hope of restoring my cultivation in this puppet body," Mo Xingdao expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Qin Sang.</p><p>Without Qin Sang's wholehearted assistance, his fate would have been uncertain.</p><p>"I hope you recover soon so we can explore the Heavenly Altar together," Qin Sang said with a relieved nod.</p><p>Detecting something in Qin Sang's words, Mo Xingdao's eyes lit up. "Have you been to the Heavenly Altar again?  Any progress?"</p><p>"I've been there several times. I haven't located the Red Gold Spirit Needle, but I have some leads," Qin Sang paused, then gestured to display a series of scenes. "Take a look, friend.  Do any of these feel familiar?"</p><p>He projected the various illusions he had encountered in the Heavenly Altar.</p><p>Mo Xingdao watched intently, marveling at the strangeness of the illusions and awed by Qin Sang's strength. Although he didn't see Qin Sang entering the illusions, he could sense the inherent dangers through the images.</p><p>After their exchange, Qin Sang left Mo's residence and began his journey home.</p><p>His inquiries had revealed no significant changes in the situation; the Ghost Fang nation and the Daoist Court were still at an impasse. But after his previous experiences, Qin Sang preferred to take a longer, safer route.</p><p>He returned safely to his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang resumed his usual routine of meditative cultivation.</p><p>But shortly after, he awoke, taking out an object—the thunder tortoise's demon pill, its luster now considerably dull.</p><p>Since reaching the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang had relied primarily on the thunder tortoise demon pill's power to refine his spirit-beast pouch.</p><p>The thunder tortoise had possessed mid-Nascent Soul cultivation in life, but with continuous use, a single demon pill couldn't sustain his cultivation to the peak of the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"A pity. I haven't found any Nascent Soul-level beasts in the Abyssal Wasteland…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  With his current strength, he could even confront a late-Nascent Soul beast and stand a chance of killing it.</p><p>However, the Abyssal Wasteland was currently unsafe.  Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to linger there.</p><p>He might have to try the Azure-Luán primordial thunder power.</p><p>After some contemplation, Qin Sang summoned his spirit-beast pouch and continued extracting thunder power, sketching runes.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang maintained a regular schedule, refining his spirit-beast pouch and cultivating simultaneously, tackling the illusions periodically, returning to contemplate countermeasures whenever he encountered resistance.</p><p>In his third year of cultivation, Qin Sang left his cave dwelling once more, having made a decision to press on and finally locate the Red Gold Spirit Needle.</p><p>Passing through various illusions, Qin Sang successfully reached the point where he had previously stopped.</p><p>Ahead lay a vast expanse of white mist.</p><p>A thick fog, like a great river within the sacred grounds, stretched endlessly in both directions, a barrier across their path. The fog drifted from right to left, seemingly slow, yet possessing a force far more terrifying than any torrent.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his last attempt.  He'd managed only halfway, his Cloud Wanderer Sword useless against this peculiar obstacle; he'd had to rely solely on his physical strength to traverse it.  But after careful reflection, a sudden insight struck him – he’d overlooked something. This time, he came to test his theory.</p><p>With the Cloud Wanderer Sword hovering above, Qin Sang activated only the Vajra Wheel Seal and stepped into the fog.</p><p>The instant he entered the misty river, a forceful current struck him, tossing him about. He focused solely on survival, offering no resistance, like a small boat adrift.</p><p>Drifting aimlessly downstream, seemingly resigned to his fate, Qin Sang's eyes flashed with intense light.  An incredibly powerful sword intent erupted.  The Cloud Wanderer Sword vanished, replaced by the constellation of Sword Stars.</p><p>The seven-mansion sword formation, though identical, wielded with the Cloud Wanderer and the Grey Warbler swords displayed a significant difference in power. This was unsurprising; the Cloud Wanderer was his spiritual sword, perfectly attuned to his will, and superior in quality to the Grey Warbler.</p><p>The Sword Stars appeared.</p><p>Only the swirling fog was contained within the array.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the center of the formation, a smile slowly spreading across his face.  “Something’s behind this, manipulating the fog.  It's not a living creature…in fact, I haven’t encountered any real living things within these sacred grounds…”</p><p>The chaotic fog, trapped and unable to escape, began to coalesce in the center, forming the outline of a tiger-like beast, which roared at the Sword Stars.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang was engrossed in his training and exploration, a storm was brewing elsewhere.</p><p>In the northern part of the Baishi sacred grounds, at a certain temple, dark clouds gathered, and heavy snow fell, plunging the region into the depths of winter overnight.</p><p>A Daoist priest, his expression grave and his movements hurried, strode through the snow, entering the temple.</p><p>"Greetings to the Imperial Inspector!"</p><p>Those he met along the way bowed in reverence.</p><p>This was Wan Zhenren, the same Daoist who had briefly met Qin Sang at the Jushan sacred grounds.</p><p>With an urgent matter pressing upon him, he merely nodded slightly to his fellow priests before hurrying past, leaving them filled with wonder and speculation about what momentous event had transpired.</p><p>Wan Zhenren headed straight for a secluded hall deep within the temple.  He slowed his pace at the entrance, adjusted his robes, and bowed before seeking an audience.</p><p>"Enter," a strong voice boomed from within.</p><p>Wan Zhenren gently pushed open the door and entered, finding an elderly Daoist seated behind a desk.  With utmost respect, he addressed him as "Uncle-Master."</p><p>The old Daoist was a high-ranking Grand Master from the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy.  His official rank was equivalent to a high court official, holding immense authority within the Daoist court.  His position in the academy was second only to the highest-ranking official.</p><p>Wan Zhenren's use of "Uncle-Master" indicated a close relationship.</p><p>"What is this urgent matter?" the old Daoist asked, his gaze calm and unperturbed.</p><p>Wan Zhenren said gravely, "The Gui Fang nation has begun their operation."</p><p>"Oh?" The old Daoist's eyes flickered. "Confirmed?"</p><p>Wan Zhenren nodded. "Experts from the two academies have been entangled with demons in the Abyss of Woe for years, with neither side gaining a clear advantage. However, a decree has just been issued from the sacred grounds confirming that the treasure they fought over was not lost to the Jushan sacred grounds, but rather, originated from within!"</p><p>The old Daoist pondered this, then nodded. "If that's the case, given the demons' nature, they won't wait a moment longer. They must be gathering their forces for a large-scale incursion into the sacred grounds."</p><p>"I beg to receive the imperial order! I will immediately mobilize personnel to enter the sacred grounds to slay demons and eliminate evil; we will not let them succeed," Wan Zhenren bowed, eagerly volunteering for the mission.</p><p>The old Daoist rose and stepped out of the hall, gazing at the dark, snowy night sky. His expression was unreadable, and he sighed softly, "The storm is coming! The demons' conspiracy has been uncovered, and their desperation will lead to a fierce battle. I will join you."</p><p>Wan Zhenren rejoiced. "With Uncle-Master stationed outside the sacred grounds, evil will surely be repelled!"</p><p>"Not so," the old Daoist gently shook his head.  "I will accompany you into the Jushan sacred grounds."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Wan Zhenren was stunned.</p><p>As he knew, the Jushan sacred grounds were one of the most unique places in the world.  A Grand Master entering would trigger a violent reaction from the sacred grounds' power, leading to certain death—a fact repeatedly proven throughout history, and unavoidable.</p><p>Meeting the old Daoist's profound gaze, Wan Zhenren suddenly understood, and his face paled. "Uncle-Master, you intend to…"</p><p>It wasn't entirely impossible for a Grand Master to enter the grounds.  For instance, by sacrificing their cultivation.</p><p>"Uncle-Master, please reconsider!"</p><p>Wan Zhenren was horrified, falling to his knees and imploring him.  To sacrifice one's cultivation, to fall back to a lower level, even if recovery were possible, would be a monumental undertaking.  For a Grand Master, to risk their life in such a manner would be a tremendous loss to the Daoist court.</p><p>Wan Zhenren could scarcely imagine what could be so important as to warrant such a decision from his Uncle-Master! What exactly were the Daoist court and the demons fighting over?</p><p>The old Daoist slowly returned to his seat, gently stroking the jade desk.</p><p>"With your current cultivation, you are privy to some secrets…"</p><p>The old Daoist's eyes were deep and distant, as if recalling something, before asking a question.</p><p>"What is a god?"</p><p>(End)</p>
