<h1>Chapter 827: A Choice</h1><p>Chapter 827: A Choice</p><p>“It seems like quite some time has passed…”</p><p>Qin Sang entered the courtyard, summoning the message token into his hand.  It was indeed from two years prior. The message didn't specify the matter, only instructing Qin Sang to contact the informant upon his return, and the two would meet again at a later date.</p><p>He probably missed a good opportunity due to his absence.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's eyes, the senior, Qingzhu, was far more important than Xiang Yi; he had no regrets.</p><p>After returning, he had been closely following news from the Liefeng Islands.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang, cloaked, crushed the message token, left the courtyard, and headed towards the appointed shop.</p><p>The shop owner was still the same white-haired elder.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the man’s face lit up.  “Senior, you’re finally back! The master returned once two years ago, but left the next day.”</p><p>“I had urgent matters to attend to, resulting in this delay,” Qin Sang said gravely. “Did Madam Liu leave any message before she departed?”</p><p>The shopkeeper whispered, “Before leaving, the master instructed me to inform her upon your return. She will personally visit you, Senior. Since you are back, I shall contact the master immediately.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I shouldn’t be leaving Tianxing Island for the next few years. Madam Liu can simply visit me at my courtyard upon her return.”</p><p>After settling his affairs, it was nightfall when Qin Sang returned to his cave.</p><p>The stars shone brilliantly.</p><p>He immediately resumed cultivating the *Tianyao Lianxing* technique.  Just past midnight, Qin Sang let out a soft whistle; a crackling sound resonated within his body, and a thin layer of sweat broke out on his skin.</p><p>“Broken through to the mid-second stage!”</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with joy. He tested his strength with a punch; his physique had indeed significantly improved.</p><p>During his time at the Liefeng Islands, his cultivation had been intermittent, between travelling and investigating, but he had finally broken through to the mid-second stage.</p><p>“I bought some pills beneficial for physical enhancement.  Barring unforeseen circumstances, I should reach the late-second stage in a little over ten years and be ready for a breakthrough.”</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time, making plans.</p><p>“To break through to the third stage, the requirements for Star Yuan Infusion are extremely high. Even with a treasure like the Star Spirit Net, it wouldn’t be enough. I must find a suitable location. Or I must find the two other spirit herbs and use their power to forcibly break through.  I need to prepare both aspects simultaneously…”</p><p>Thinking of the herbs, Qin Sang's mind stirred. He took out the Ba Xue Fruit and approached the two-headed… creature.</p><p>“This fruit is called the Ba Xue Fruit. It’s especially effective for your kind. Take it. The effect is quite potent and extremely painful. Remember to use your bloodline power to refine the medicinal energy. Your cultivation is not bad, so you should be fine…”</p><p>Qin Sang kept his promise, giving the promised fruit to the two-headed… creature and explaining its effects.</p><p>The two-headed… creature, unable to contain its excitement, snatched the fruit and swallowed it whole.</p><p>After swallowing the fruit, the two-headed… creature made a series of… noises.</p><p>Qin Sang guarded it, adding several layers of protective barriers while observing the two-headed… creature.</p><p>The two-headed… creature was already a top-tier cultivator at the mid-Yao Dan stage. After consuming the Ba Xue Fruit, it would likely reach the peak of the mid-Yao Dan stage, but a breakthrough to the next stage was unlikely.</p><p>Before transforming, it's even more difficult for demon beasts to break through than cultivators.</p><p>The Ba Xue Fruit wasn't a spirit herb designed to refine bloodlines or assist breakthroughs.</p><p>The calm didn't last long.</p><p>Shortly after swallowing the Ba Xue Fruit, the two-headed… creature suddenly let out a roar, its body arching violently before crashing to the ground, a faint blood glow emanating from its body.</p><p>Under the blood glow, the two-headed… creature’s… body writhed; insects crawled everywhere, its bones seemed to shift, making clicking sounds, accompanied by even more intense pain.</p><p>Its… features became fragmented.</p><p>Its four claws dug into the ground; its two heads swayed wildly, unsure where to turn, its vertical pupils closed tightly, its face contorted in pain.  Then, its body curled up tightly and began to tremble violently.</p><p>“What a potent effect. It’s not even fully mature. Truly a ferocious medicine.”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly apprehensive seeing the two-headed… creature’s state.</p><p>He imagined that he would suffer even worse if he took it.</p><p>The medicinal power continued to impact the two-headed… creature.  Its… sounds became raspy, its body curled into a ball as it struggled against the Ba Xue Fruit’s power, its external appearance showing no sign of cultivation advancement.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t worried; the two-headed… creature would easily overcome the effects of the fruit.</p><p>After a while, seeing that the two-headed… creature’s condition hadn’t worsened, Qin Sang ignored it. He was about to resume his cultivation when he caught sight of something that made his expression change drastically.</p><p>A small lump appeared between the two heads of the twin-headed beast!</p><p>A late-stage twin-headed beast will develop a large lump between its two heads. When the lump grows into a third head, it signifies the beast's transformation into its final form.</p><p>The appearance of the small lump meant the twin-headed beast was on the verge of breaking through to the next stage.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>He faced a dilemma.</p><p>If the twin-headed beast broke through its current stage, it would exceed the limits of the Hun Yuan concentric ring, breaking free from his control. Unexpectedly, consuming a Dominating Blood Fruit had allowed it to achieve such a breakthrough.</p><p>Stopping it would maintain control.</p><p>Finding another beast at its peak mid-stage would be difficult, especially one as good as this. Otherwise, he would have considered replacing it long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, but ultimately, he did nothing, simply watching.</p><p>Remembering their years together, the twin-headed beast had served him faithfully, and if it was destined to break through, he would grant it freedom.  His own strength was now considerable, and he didn't need the twin-headed beast anymore.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>By dawn, the lump on the twin-headed beast pulsed, sometimes growing larger, sometimes smaller, but it remained unable to break through, its aura noticeably weakening.</p><p>Another attempt at breaking through failed.</p><p>The twin-headed beast whimpered, its eyes looking at Qin Sang with a weak, pleading gaze.</p><p>Qin Sang understood; it wanted his help.</p><p>He sighed softly, saying, "You know that breaking through will free you from all restraints. Don't blame me for taking advantage, if you can break through on your own, I will let you go, otherwise…"</p><p>Qin Sang produced a Dominating Blood Fruit and placed it before the beast.</p><p>"I can give you this fruit, but you must submit to me as your master. For decades, you've accompanied me through countless dangers, and you've witnessed my abilities. I'm not boasting, but I believe I'm no less skilled than any Golden Core cultivator, and I'm determined to reach the Nascent Soul stage. Being my spirit beast isn't beneath you; I can also help you find demonic cultivation techniques. Besides, humans live far shorter lives than demonic beasts; Nascent Soul cultivators live only a thousand years or so. I promise to release you from your bond before I die."</p><p>Qin Sang took a step back.  "Consider it carefully."</p><p>After submission, it would be his own, and he could impart the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" technique.  However, Qin Sang didn't mention this; he suspected the technique was linked to many secrets and leaking it to a transformed demonic beast could bring disaster.</p><p>The twin-headed beast stared intently at the Dominating Blood Fruit, struggling with the decision.</p>
