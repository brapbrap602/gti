<h1>Chapter 414: In the Blink of an Eye</h1><p>Chapter 414: In the Blink of an Eye</p><p>After settling Ning Youwei and his son, Qin Sang went alone to the Wuyagu Valley.  In the Qingyang Market, the shop's inventory wasn't very valuable, so Qin Sang wasn't worried about them absconding with the funds.  Although his ebony sword was reduced to a sword core and unusable, Qin Sang had plenty of protective artifacts.  With Sun Xin's map, he spent most of his time in the second layer of Wuyagu Valley, hunting monsters.  The second layer was sparsely populated, and his cautious approach allowed him to gradually adapt to the trials of the valley, finding it not much different from the ancient Immortal battlefield.</p><p>After a period of training, or when he had gathered enough materials, he would return to Qingyang Market to focus on cultivation and the study of refining, delving into the contents of the jade slips.  Finally, he would apply his understanding to the ebony sword, with considerable success. This greatly reduced the time it took the sword to absorb energy, and even strengthened their connection. Although this slightly affected his cultivation, the rewards were far greater.</p><p>…</p><p>In the blink of an eye, twenty-eight years had passed.  'Sword Pavilion' had become quite well-known in Qingyang Market. Initially, it was an inconspicuous little shop, selling only low-grade artifacts. The staff were taciturn, and most customers were cultivators below the sixth level of Qi Condensation.  Fair prices attracted a loyal clientele.  As Qin Sang's refining skills improved, the grade of artifacts on the shelves gradually increased, with other types of artifacts becoming increasingly rare, until the vast majority were various types of spirit swords. The shop, filled with spirit swords, lived up to the name 'Sword Pavilion'!</p><p>This unique shop gradually gained fame, attracting many cultivators. Many who came to Qingyang Market would make a point of visiting Sword Pavilion to see if any new swords were available. While it wasn't exactly a rush, business was always steady.  When Qin Sang began incorporating cold gold into his spirit swords to improve their quality, demand exceeded supply.  That was in his thirteenth year in Qingyang Market.  For thirteen years, he never stopped studying refining, consistently producing a large batch of lower-quality artifacts for practice. He had a certain success rate in creating high-grade artifacts. The shop gradually became profitable, but it didn’t make much spiritual stones.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had looted Yu Hua's pouch, leaving him with ample funds to sustain himself for this extended period. However, when he attempted to refine top-grade artifacts, he hit a bottleneck.  Several consecutive failures resulted in costs he could no longer bear. The stone fire generated by the spirit array was insufficient for refining top-grade artifacts, requiring him to rent the city’s underground fire veins at a high price.  Not all underground fire veins were suitable for refining artifacts or pills; he needed a stable flame, complemented by various spirit arrays and restrictions to control the fire vein.  This was a difficult task for Qin Sang alone.  He had to spend this money.</p><p>Even more painful was the significant waste of precious materials with each failure.  After much reflection, Qin Sang realized he couldn't continue this reckless spending, as he didn't have unlimited resources.  He decided on a roundabout strategy: refine high-grade artifacts and then enhance the quality of spirit swords using various precious materials; this would be less challenging. Once he could refine spirit swords comparable to top-grade artifacts, he would have accumulated enough experience to try again.</p><p>He learned this approach from the notes of the Wu family ancestors.  Generations of Wu family ancestors had dedicated themselves to refining, but limited by talent, few managed to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage; this method was how they improved their refining skills.  This led Qin Sang to focus on a piece of cold gold. The cold gold refined from the cold gold ore was one of his best materials, and using it on low-grade artifacts was wasteful.  For the ebony sword, Qin Sang didn’t worry about this.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang failed several times before mastering the nature of cold gold. Artifacts incorporating cold gold not only possessed extreme cold properties but also had enhanced durability.  The same artifact, with added cold gold, immediately stood out. When news spread that someone had found an artifact with cold gold in Sword Pavilion, its reputation soared, and customers came in a steady stream.  Many more people took notice of the Sword Pavilion, including various factions and trading houses.  By inquiring about the changes in the artifacts sold over the years, it wasn't difficult to guess that the owner of 'Sword Pavilion' was likely a refiner. To achieve this level of skill in just over a decade pointed to either exceptional talent or a strong family background.</p><p>Several merchant guilds tried to recruit the owner of the Sword Pavilion, but the owner was elusive, rarely seen by anyone.  They left messages with his assistant, hoping for a response, but to no avail.  Even those who did manage to meet Qin Sang were politely refused.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang realized he'd been too secretive. He used his identity as a weaponsmith to conceal his true origins, but he didn't want to attract the attention of powerful factions, as that could lead to unforeseen complications.</p><p>Fortunately, Ning Youwei suggested sourcing magical tools elsewhere, buying low and selling high, or diversifying into other businesses to keep the shop afloat.</p><p>By now, Ning Youwei was a forty-year-old man with a goatee. His cultivation had stagnated at the fourth level of Qi Condensation, and he'd long given up on the pursuit of immortality. He was married with children, cared for his mother, and lived a quiet life, indistinguishable from the ordinary townsfolk of the market.</p><p>Qin Sang only returned from his training to craft batches of magical tools.  The shop's business was booming, with items quickly sold out, forcing him to close shop most of the time, hence Ning Youwei's suggestion.</p><p>For over a decade, Ning Youwei had served Qin Sang diligently and capably, never making a mistake. Qin Sang didn't care much for the shop and planned to give it to Ning Youwei after leaving as a reward for his years of loyalty. So he agreed to the suggestion.</p><p>In the following years, Qin Sang rarely crafted low-grade spirit swords, focusing instead on studying the jade slip. The high-quality spirit swords he produced were not sold at the Sword Pavilion but supplied to a few friendly merchant guilds, while he remained hidden behind the scenes.</p><p>With Ning Youwei managing the shop, the business remained stable despite several changes.</p><p>The regulars, however, were heartbroken. Initially, they visited frequently, but after failing to find any spirit swords on display for a long time, they became disheartened, speculating that the weaponsmith might have left the market town to travel the world.</p><p>The former glory of the Sword Pavilion was short-lived, flourishing only for a few years before fading into obscurity, a source of much regret.</p><p>With his skills honed to a high level, Qin Sang finally crafted a top-tier magical tool! The success rate was still low, but the reward was immense; he finally understood the words of the Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Xu Ling Sect in the jade slip.</p><p>In his twenty-first year in Qingyang Market Town, the Ebony Sword successfully absorbed the Bloodless Sang! Afterwards, Qin Sang refined the Blood Droplet Mushroom and the vial of Qi Condensation Pills. His third killing talisman was complete, and his cultivation advanced smoothly to the later stages of Foundation Establishment!</p>
