<h1>Chapter 277: Daoist Priest Qingfeng</h1><p>Yunyouzi also told Qin Sangming that the spirit medicine that emitted this mysterious yellow energy was not limited to the Xuanwen Yellow Essence; the probability that there was a Xuanwen Yellow Essence below that mysterious yellow energy was only fifty percent.</p><p>Besides the mysterious yellow energy, there was the possibility of finding similar spirit medicine below other energy of other colors. Yunyouzi promised that regardless of the type of spirit medicine, as long as it could help repair hidden injuries, he would do his utmost to help Qin Sang gather and refine the pills, free of charge.</p><p>Similarly, Qin Sang also had to return the favor and provide assistance to Yunyouzi when he was in need.</p><p>Yunyouzi suspected that there was a high possibility that these spirit medicines had guardian spirit beasts, and that even if they managed to arrive safely, gathering the medicine would not be easy; they would need to work together in unity.</p><p>This request was reasonable, so Qin Sang did not hesitate to agree.</p><p>However, before that, the first thing they needed to consider was how to find this suspected medicine garden.</p><p>The discovery of this place had many twists and turns.</p><p>Originally, this place was an ancient immortal’s cave in the middle of Jiuyong Pass and Xuanlan Pass, in the area where the inner and middle zones intersected, beyond the reach of major sects and a place of chaos since ancient times.</p><p>The commotion of the cave’s emergence attracted a lot of attention, including that of many Foundation Building stage immortal cultivators.</p><p>However, after breaking the outer restriction, people found that the cave was empty and contained no valuables, so the people who entered the cave returned empty-handed.</p><p>Fortunately, the remaining restrictions of the cave were still intact, so later on, some immortal cultivators repaired the restrictions and built a market here called Qiuhong Market.</p><p>Because of its location, Qiuhong Market had no other markets or towns nearby, and the restrictions of Qiuhong Market were powerful so as to remain standing for decades, thus it was an extremely safe haven. Consequently, the people in the market gradually increased, and its reputation became greater and greater.</p><p>Until one year, a natural phenomenon came, and unexpectedly, a large group of cloud beasts comparable to the Foundation Building stage came out from the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and wandered to Qiuhong Market, leading to its destruction and the encirclement of the market's owner by the beasts. People were shocked to discover that there was a hidden universe inside Qiuhong Market!</p><p>Deep within Qiuhong Market, there was actually a great protective array concealed, and within the protective array was where the genuine cave was located!</p><p>That was where the ancient immortal’s real treasure trove was!</p><p>Because of the huge commotion created by the emergence of the cave, many people knew about this place. The owner of the market could not have kept it for himself, so he came up with an idea to spend a large sum of money to repair the restrictions, then borrowed the market to hide his intentions while secretly trying to break the protective array.</p><p>After the protective array was exposed, people came in droves to explore Qiuhong Market, but the protective array was very dangerous, so it was not easy to get in. Many people died within the array.</p><p>Later, the pattern of the protective array was finally understood: about every thirty years, the array would enter a low point. During the low point of the array, if Foundation Building stage immortal cultivators formed an array to enter together, there was also a high probability of succeeding.</p><p>Over the years, batches of immortal cultivators had come and gone, but this secret path had never been discovered before.</p><p>The scene in the jade pendant was made by the first person to discover the secret path, who had copied down what they saw. However, after this person left, they mysteriously died and the information had never been leaked out.</p><p>Until two years ago, some news that seemed to be true or false suddenly began to spread, about the secret path and the medicine garden, with the trend of gaining momentum. Of course, most people did not believe it.</p><p>Because in Qiuhong Market, besides several important places, every other corner had been searched countless times. It was not an exaggeration to say that the ground had been dug three feet deep. If there was any secret path or treasure, it would have already been found.</p><p>Moreover, this kind of rumor was not the first time it had been spread, and it was not only spread when Qiuhong Market emerged. Almost every time a similar situation occurred, there were people with ulterior motives who spread various rumors and attempted to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>After receiving the news, Yunyouzi followed the principle of not missing any opportunity and personally went on a trip. Coincidentally, he saw the scene in the jade pendant and thus confirmed that the news was very likely true.</p><p>Since the person who had left the scene in the jade pendant was dead, Yunyouzi did not know the exact location of the secret path and could only think of other ways.</p><p>After a meticulous investigation, Yunyouzi suspected that the person’s death was greatly related to the companions who had entered Qiuhong Market with him thirty years ago. Finally, he focused on three people.</p><p>These three people were also going to enter during the next low point of the array, and they were currently gathering people and practicing the array.</p><p>The first thing they needed to do was to mix into the ranks of these three people before the protective array reached its low point. By secretly observing these people’s movements, they could determine who the murderer was.</p><p>So, besides Qin Sang and Yunyouzi, there was another person traveling with them.</p><p>The three of them needed to act separately.</p><p>Having determined the goal, then look for a chance to contact.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang put away the jade pendant. After ten more days, it will be the appointed time for him and Wanderer to set out to Qiu Hong Market and seek an opportunity to blend into one of the teams.</p><p>Qin Sang tidied himself up. After the Wumu Sword swallowed the Black Yan Zhang, its power has increased by another point. The Shifang Yanluo Banner and Treasure Talisman Ruyi are his last trump cards, plus the Nine Dragon Tiannian Talisman, which has been mostly restored, with these treasures, as long as he is careful, Qin Sang is not worried about his safety.</p><p>However, some of them cannot be seen by others. After using them, he must be prepared to kill and silence the people.</p><p>Before this, it is best to keep a low profile.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qin Sang walked out of the cave mansion, closed the ban, and went straight to Xuanlu Pass, spent some spirit stones to replenish several magic weapons, and made full preparations.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The Wanderer arrived as promised.</p><p>"Brother Qin, there is a message from there..."</p><p>The Wanderer came in a hurry,"The great array of the Qiu Hong Market, this time the low tide will appear later, it may be postponed by one to two years. At that time, there may be more people entering the Qiu Hong Market. However, the longer the time, the easier it is to gain each other's trust. For us, it may not be a bad thing. But Brother Qin must act with caution, even if you have confirmed the person's identity, before my fellow Taoist Ge Yuan and I arrive, don't startle the snake."</p><p>The Wanderer is still a bit worried about Qin Sang, so he told him a thousand times to be careful.</p><p>Ge Yuan was the third person who joined forces with them. Qin Sang had not seen him yet.</p><p>This person is now潜伏in the town of Xihuang, which is the town closest to Qiu Hong Market, and is always monitoring the changes in the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang also knows that this matter is of great importance. For one person to blend into the other party's team and make a rash move is not a wise move. It is very likely to be besieged.</p><p>"Senior, don't worry, I know the importance of it, I will be careful."</p><p>The Wanderer said, "Brother Qin understands. By the way, have you decided what identity to use as a disguise?"</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "After this, senior can call me Daoist Qingfeng."</p><p>Chapter 277: Daoist Qingfeng</p><p>Wandering Scholar also spoke with Qin Sang, explaining that the mystical yellow aura wasn't unique to the Striped Yellow Essence. The chance of finding Striped Yellow Essence beneath that aura was only fifty percent.  Other colored auras might also indicate similar spiritual herbs. Wandering Scholar promised that no matter the herb, as long as it could heal internal injuries, he would assist Qin Sang in gathering it and refine it into medicine free of charge.</p><p>In return, Qin Sang would have to reciprocate, aiding Wandering Scholar when needed.</p><p>Wandering Scholar suspected these spiritual herbs might be guarded by spirit beasts. Even if they reached the location, harvesting the herbs wouldn't be easy and would require joint effort.</p><p>This request was reasonable, and Qin Sang naturally agreed.</p><p>However, before that, their primary concern was how to find this suspected medicinal garden.</p><p>The discovery of this place was quite a story.</p><p>It was originally the cave dwelling of an ancient cultivator, located between Nine Serenity Pass and Hanging Skull Pass, in the border region between the inner and middle zones, beyond the reach of the major sects, and a chaotic land since ancient times.</p><p>The unearthing of the cave dwelling caused a great commotion, attracting many, including Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>However, after breaking the outer restrictions, they found the cave empty, devoid of treasures. Everyone returned empty-handed.</p><p>Fortunately, the remaining restrictions were intact.  Later, a cultivator repaired them and established a market there, named Autumn Goose Market.</p><p>Due to its isolated location, with no other markets or towns nearby, and its strong defensive restrictions, Autumn Goose Market stood for decades, becoming a safe haven.  Its popularity and traffic steadily increased.</p><p>Until one year, a celestial phenomenon occurred.  Unexpectedly, a large swarm of Cloud Beasts, comparable to Core Formation cultivators, emerged from the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and wandered to Autumn Goose Market, destroying it. The market's owner was killed by the Cloud Beasts.  Only then did everyone discover a hidden secret within Autumn Goose Market!</p><p>Deep within the market, concealed by a larger protective formation, lay the true cave dwelling!  That was the true treasure trove of the ancient cultivator!</p><p>Because the cave dwelling's initial discovery had caused such a stir, many knew of its existence.  The market's owner couldn't claim it for himself.  Instead, he devised a plan, spending a fortune to repair the outer restrictions, using the market as a cover while secretly working to break the protective formation.</p><p>After the protective formation was revealed, countless treasure hunters flocked to Autumn Goose Market. But the formation was perilous, and many died trying to enter.</p><p>Eventually, they deciphered the formation's pattern: every thirty years, it weakened. During this period, Foundation Establishment cultivators could form formations and enter together, with a high chance of success.</p><p>Over the years, groups of cultivators came and went. But this secret passage had never been discovered before.</p><p>The image on the jade pendant was a recording made by the first person to discover the passage. However, this person died mysteriously after leaving, and the news never spread.</p><p>Until two years ago, rumors of a secret passage and a medicinal garden began to circulate, gaining some traction, though most dismissed them.</p><p>After all, every corner of Autumn Goose Market, except for a few key areas, had been thoroughly searched countless times.  If any secret passages or treasures existed, they would have been found long ago.</p><p>Moreover, these rumors weren't new.  They surfaced not just when Autumn Goose Market was first discovered but almost every time similar events occurred.  Opportunists would spread all sorts of rumors, attempting to profit from the chaos.</p><p>Wandering Scholar, believing that no opportunity should be missed, investigated personally. By chance, he saw the image on the jade pendant and confirmed the rumor's potential validity.</p><p>Since the person who left the jade pendant was dead, Wandering Scholar didn't know the passage's exact location and needed another approach.</p><p>After a thorough investigation, Wandering Scholar suspected that the person's death was related to their companions from thirty years prior, who had entered Autumn Goose Market together.  He narrowed his focus to three individuals.</p><p>These three were also planning to enter during the formation's weakening period, currently gathering people and practicing formations.</p><p>Their first task was to infiltrate these three individuals' group before the formation weakened, observe them, and identify the killer.</p><p>Therefore, besides Qin Sang and Wandering Scholar, there was one other person.</p><p>The three of them would act separately.</p><p>After setting his target, he would look for opportunities to make contact.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang put away the jade pendant. In ten days, he was to meet Wandering Scholar as agreed and head to Autumn Wilds Market, looking for a chance to infiltrate one of the groups.</p><p>Qin Sang assessed his current state.  The Ebony Sword's power had increased after absorbing the Blackflame Camphorwood.  The Ten Yama King Flag and the Jade Ruyi Talisman were his trump cards. Coupled with the mostly recovered Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, with these treasures, as long as he was cautious, Qin Sang wasn't worried about his safety.</p><p>However, some of these items couldn't be exposed to the light. After using them, he would need to be prepared to silence any witnesses.</p><p>Before that, it was best to conceal his identity.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang left the cave, sealed the restrictions, and headed straight for Skull Gorge Pass.  He spent some spirit stones replenishing a few magical tools, making thorough preparations.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Wandering Scholar arrived as promised.</p><p>"Brother Qin, there's news from that side…"</p><p>Wandering Scholar said hurriedly, "The weakening of Autumn Wilds Market's grand formation will be delayed.  It might be pushed back by one or two years. There might be even more people entering the market then. But a longer timeframe makes it easier to gain their trust, which might not be a bad thing for us. However, Brother Qin, you must be cautious.  Even if you confirm the target's identity, don't act rashly before Fellow Daoist Ge Yuan and I arrive."</p><p>Wandering Scholar was still a bit worried about Qin Sang and gave him repeated warnings.</p><p>Ge Yuan was the third person they were collaborating with, someone Qin Sang hadn't met yet.</p><p>This person was currently lying low in West Wasteland Town, the town closest to Autumn Wilds Market, keeping track of the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang also knew the importance of this matter. Infiltrating the enemy group alone and acting rashly wasn't wise and could lead to being surrounded.</p><p>"Rest assured, Senior, I understand the gravity of the situation and will be careful."</p><p>Wandering Scholar hummed in agreement. "Good that you understand, Brother Qin. By the way, have you decided on a disguise?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "From now on, Senior, please call me Daoist Clearwind."</p>
