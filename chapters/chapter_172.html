<h1>Chapter 165: Anomalous Zombie</h1><p>Although tougher than zombies, corpses are also lifeless and lack intelligence. All the corpses we encountered before were both hideous and dull, with a natural bloodlust and tendency to murder.</p><p>Could this corpse have been constantly absorbing spiritual power in the cave, thus developing intelligence over time?</p><p>Having activated the Tears of Celestial Stars in advance for protection, Qin Sang was still worried, so he grabbed a bunch of spirit charms out of his mustard seed bag and was also holding the Soul Devouring Awl and the Dark Yin Bomb in his hands.</p><p>These two magical treasures would be destroyed after one use. They were very valuable, but they were nothing compared to his own life.</p><p>…</p><p>The spacious hall was far grander than the other two Qin Sang had encountered. The two huge black iron doors were even taller. The ancient corpse drawings on them looked even more formidable, with their menacing eyes gazing ahead and frightening the living daylights out of people.</p><p>After entering the hall, all three of them felt a sudden, intense oppression and looked around the hall with apprehension. The hall was just as messy, with shattered stone pillars and blocks of stone everywhere. The ground and walls were covered in trenches, showing that it had clearly experienced a great battle. However, there were far fewer corpses and they did not see any other zombies.</p><p>In the corner to the left of the hall, there was a strange skeleton. The skeleton was leaning against the wall with a noticeable knife wound on its rib cage. The ribs covering the heart area had been completely severed. This should be the fatal wound.</p><p>In front of the skeleton on the ground, there was a black iron stake covered in dust. One could vaguely make out drawings of flying dragons and clouds with some fine cracks on it. It looked like a magical treasure that was broken beyond repair. One couldn’t tell whether it could be used or not.</p><p>Around the iron stake, dozens of broken pale jade blocks were neatly arranged. These were spirit stones which had had their spiritual energy drained and shattered. The placement of the blocks was neat, resembling a magic formation.</p><p>Among the entire hall, this was the only intact skeleton, making it the most eye-catching.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the skeleton and noticed a small black satchel under its butt. The satchel was facing up, allowing him to see inside and he noticed that it was empty. It was not a mustard seed bag.</p><p>The skeleton’s left hand was tightly holding onto an ancient token that was identical to the black iron token the White Cloud Hermit found. The back of it faced up while ‘Heavenly Corpse Cult’ was written on it in the same handwriting.</p><p>However, this ancient token was silver in color instead. A thick layer of dust could not hide its silvery color.</p><p>At Mount Shaohua, the waist tokens used by disciples in the Foundation Establishment Period were different from those used by disciples in the Qi Refinement Period. They were used to distinguish status. The person before them must have had a higher status than the others outside when alive because he was wearing a different token. Qin Sang glanced at it and ignored it.</p><p>The White Cloud Hermit and Wu Yuesheng did the same because they had also found Liu Jiang quickly.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Liu!”</p><p>The White Cloud Hermit stared at a corner of the hall and suddenly exclaimed out loud.</p><p>Following his gaze, Qin Sang also felt slightly stunned.</p><p>The zombie was standing behind a broken stone pillar, hiding in the shadows and had inserted its hand into Liu Jiang’s chest, grabbing his heart and lifting him up. A pair of fangs were piercing Liu Jiang’s neck as it sucked his blood and energy. Fresh blood dripped from the corners of its mouth.</p><p>‘Drip, drop…‘</p><p>The bloody smell was enough to make one’s nostrils flare. The scene was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Terror and fear still lingered in Liu Jiang’s eyes as he looked with wide eyes. In this short period of time, his energy had been drained by the zombie and his figure withered before their eyes, turning into a dried corpse.</p><p>The wounds on his chest and neck dealt by the zombie were spreading with a dark green corpse poison that began eating away at his body, causing a strong stench.</p><p>The person who had been alive just now met with such an end in the blink of an eye.</p><p>‘Pa!’</p><p>A cracking sound rang out.</p><p>After draining Liu Jiang’s energy, the zombie casually tossed his body aside and licked the corner of its lips with its scarlet tongue. It looked at the three of them with greed in its eyes as though they were three delectable treats.</p><p>Finally getting a clear view of the zombie's appearance, Qin Sang’s heart sank. He had been right earlier: this zombie was indeed different from the ones before.</p><p>The same strong earth devil qi lingered around its body, but by looking through the earth devil qi at its true appearance, one would realize that except for its nails, fangs, and crimson eyes, it did not look like a zombie at all.</p><p>After being refined by the earth devil qi, other zombies had their flesh and blood condensed, making them comparable to iron and greatly strengthening their defenses. However, this came at the cost of their bodies being disfigured, making them look like evil spirits.</p><p>The evil corpse still retained its appearance from when it was alive. Although its face was pale, its features were sunken, and its expression distorted, one could see that it was a handsome young man before it died.</p><p>After absorbing Liu Jiang's blood and vitality, a touch of rosy color appeared on its body, and the sunken skin slowly filled out, especially its face, which looked almost the same as that of a living person after it recovered.</p><p>This strange scene shocked Qin Sang, who couldn't help but wonder if it could still be called an evil corpse. Which corpse refiner had spent many years cultivating it or was it a special corpse refining technique of the Heaven Corpse Sect?</p><p>"Heh heh..."</p><p>The evil corpse licked the blood clean from its two hands, and made a series of strange laughs. Its blood-red eyes stared at the three of them, and its greedy look grew stronger.</p><p>When the White Cloud Mountain Man saw Liu Jiang's miserable corpse, a look of sadness filled his face. He immediately took out his wooden staff and glared fiercely at the evil corpse. With a roar, he shouted, "Kill it!"</p><p>The White Cloud Mountain Man raised his wooden staff, and spiritual power疯狂涌入 the magic artifact. With a sudden jab at the evil corpse, a large patch of flowers, plants, and trees was created out of thin air.</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>The grass and leaves instantly wilted, turning into a mass of flying daggers and swords, which shot towards the evil corpse like a torrential downpour. If a cultivator with slightly weaker cultivation dodged it too late, they would be beaten into a hornet's nest.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>There were only crisp sounds as the grass and leaves shattered, turning into countless specks of green light that dissipated. After a moment of chaos, the evil corpse disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed, and he shouted a warning, "White Cloud Daoist friend, be careful!"</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, there was a loud 'boom', and the White Cloud Mountain Man's figure retreated abruptly. He held his wooden staff horizontally to block the evil corpse's sharp claws, but he couldn't withstand the enormous force and was knocked back several steps.</p><p>After suffering this blow from the White Cloud Mountain Man, the evil corpse was completely unharmed.</p><p>Its nails were covered with corpse poison, which shone with a black-green light. It relentlessly pursued the White Cloud Mountain Man, and in the blink of an eye, one of the evil corpse's hands bypassed the wooden staff and nearly pierced the White Cloud Mountain Man's chest.</p><p>The White Cloud Mountain Man was shocked into a cold sweat. He hurriedly swung his wooden staff to flick the sharp claws away, and then his figure retreated abruptly.</p><p>However, this turn of events actually worked to their advantage.</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Yuesheng exchanged glances, and without rushing to rescue the White Cloud Mountain Man, they immediately spread out to the sides, bypassed the White Cloud Mountain Man, and their formation changed in an instant. The three of them formed a three-才 formation, surrounding the evil corpse in the middle.</p>
