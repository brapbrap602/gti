<h1>Chapter 1398: Nine Rings Island</h1><p>Chapter 1398: Nine Rings Island</p><p>“The Spirit Sea…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the famous sea areas he knew in the Boundless Sea, but there was no Spirit Sea among them.</p><p>Elder Luo saw Qin Sang’s confusion and explained, “Friend Daoist, don’t misunderstand.  Whether it was called Clear Lake before, or the current Spirit Sea, it’s not very well-known in the Boundless Sea, nor are there any remarkable rumors about it. It’s just a name on a nautical chart. Daoists active in the southern Boundless Sea might be more familiar with it.  It’s said that the Spirit Sea has no islands, the seawater is exceptionally clear, and there are no storms year-round. Ships sailing here don’t have to worry about capsizing due to storms, which is rare in the south.  Traveling here, one’s heart becomes tranquil.  It was called Clear Lake before, probably for this reason…”</p><p>Saying this, Elder Luo took out a nautical chart and pointed out the location of the Spirit Sea to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Spirit Sea is even further south than Nine Rings Island, and the two places are not close. But for a Nascent Soul cultivator, it's only a three or five-day journey.</p><p>It can’t be a coincidence!</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that Valley Master Mu’s Clear Lake was this place.</p><p>To his surprise, there were no rumors related to ancient ruins or secret realms in Clear Lake.</p><p>“The Witch Clan’s legacy couldn’t have sprung from a crack in a rock. Perhaps something is hidden. Did Valley Master Mu have a new discovery upon returning to Clear Lake?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the nautical chart and pondered.</p><p>Clear Lake, now the Spirit Sea, is a vast sea area. Searching alone for a possibly existing secret realm here would be truly looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Furthermore, without any related legends for so long, even if there is some secret hidden, it won’t be easy to discover.</p><p>For now, the best course of action is to meet Valley Master Mu first.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired with the Nine Stars Sect about news of the Xuan Tian Palace, asking if there were any recent rumors or unusual activities.</p><p>Elder Luo was surprised by Qin Sang’s far-reaching requests, saying with difficulty, “Most of our forces are in the west-central Boundless Sea. Unless the Xuan Tian Palace attacks the Boundless Sea, or a Xuan Tian Palace expert does something in the Boundless Sea, otherwise, the news wouldn’t reach us so quickly…”</p><p>Afterwards.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Nine Stars Sea area, no longer hesitating, and flew directly towards Nine Rings Island.</p><p>Months after bidding farewell to Lan Jingsi, Qin Sang finally arrived at Nine Rings Island.</p><p>The current island master of Nine Rings Island is only at the early Nascent Soul stage, but thanks to Nine Rings Island’s reputation, it’s well-known in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>This is because the first island master of Nine Rings Island, Nine Rings Real Person, was an undeniable strong cultivator, said to be only one step away from becoming a Grand Cultivator, once renowned alongside the Demon-Mixing Elder.</p><p>Ultimately, the Demon-Mixing Elder successfully took that step, while Nine Rings Real Person stopped short, eventually falling.</p><p>“So much time has passed, I wonder if anything has changed in the meantime.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Nine Rings Island and slowly flew into the island, landing before the city gate.</p><p>Nine Rings Island is quite prosperous, with cultivators and mortals living together without any obvious segregation.</p><p>The city streets were bustling with people.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired briefly and easily found the place, a medium-sized shop called the Treasure Light Pavilion.</p><p>There were no customers in the shop, only an old shopkeeper.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the shop, and the old shopkeeper glanced at him, quickly rising to greet him, “Friend Daoist, do you need pills or magical artifacts?”</p><p>“Are you Zhang Xuan?”</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings. Seeing the old shopkeeper nod, he said, “This Daoist is Mingyue, and I am here at the invitation of Daoist Mu.”</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang took out the token Lan Jingsi had given him before his departure.</p><p>The old shopkeeper's face changed slightly, and he whispered, “Please follow me to the back hall, Senior!  Senior Mu has already prepared a high-grade cave abode for you…”</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. “How long will it take Valley Master Mu to see me?”</p><p>The old shopkeeper replied, “Senior Mu specifically instructed me a few days ago. After sending a message, he will arrive within five days at most.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, handing the old shopkeeper a guiding talisman, “Give this talisman to Daoist Mu when he returns. Ignite it, and you will be able to find this Daoist.”</p><p>Leaving behind the talisman, Qin Sang turned and left the shop decisively.</p><p>The old shopkeeper dared not stop him and could only watch helplessly as Qin Sang disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about the Spirit Sea in the city, and the information was similar to what he had learned at the Nine Stars Sect, so he didn't stay long and left Nine Rings Island that night.</p><p>Five days later.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had casually carved out a cave abode on a deserted island and was in seclusion, was suddenly awakened by a wave of fluctuations.</p><p>The talisman in his hand ignited spontaneously without fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he immediately dropped the talisman and disappeared.</p><p>Shortly after, a streak of light, without concealment, tore through the air from the direction of Nine Rings Island, landing on the deserted island, revealing a man.</p><p>The man appeared to be about forty years old, with a handsome appearance, bright eyes, and he wore a Taoist robe embroidered with the same spiritual insects as the disciples of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>It was Valley Master Mu!</p><p>He noticed the existence of the cave abode and was about to speak when he suddenly felt something and turned to see Qin Sang walking out of the woods.</p><p>"Are you Master Mingyue?"</p><p>Mu Guzhu's expression brightened, and he asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "This Daoist was delayed on the journey, keeping Mu Guzhu waiting."</p><p>He secretly sized up Mu Guzhu.</p><p>It was difficult to judge the man's strength from his aura alone.</p><p>"Not at all! Not at all! It's good that the Daoist arrived safely," Mu Guzhu laughed heartily. "The Daoist is very cautious.  I shouldn't have gone to so much trouble making all those preparations on Jiujie Island!"</p><p>"When traveling, one must be careful. Please don't blame me, friend.  Seeing you, Mu Daoist, puts my mind at ease."</p><p>Qin Sang invited Mu Guzhu into his cave dwelling for a detailed discussion.</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, they got down to business.</p><p>"Three months ago, my junior sister used a secret communication technique to tell me about the Daoist… I'll ask directly, Daoist, are you truly seeking to learn the Ascending Spirit Ritual?"</p><p>Mu Guzhu asked in a low voice.</p><p>"Yes," Qin Sang nodded. "Mu Daoist, please state your conditions. If I can manage it, I will do my best."</p><p>Mu Guzhu hesitated for a moment, then said: "Daoist, you've traveled a long way, so I won't beat around the bush. The Ascending Spirit technique is not impossible to teach you, but I need to confirm one thing first: do you possess a Three-Change Fire Jade Centipede?"</p><p>Mu Guzhu looked at Qin Sang expectantly.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's mind stirred.</p><p>Indeed, there was a reason why Mu Guzhu invited him instead of Feng Shangshi, with whom he had a closer relationship.</p><p>He was after the Fire Jade Centipede's treasure-finding ability.</p><p>"Treasure-finding? I wonder what kind of treasure it is, and what its connection to the Witch Clan is?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he readily opened his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede landed in Qin Sang's palm, oblivious to its impending fate, happily devouring a Fire Melting Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Fire Jade Centipede with affection, saying tenderly, "This Daoist is learning the Ascending Spirit Ritual for this little fellow."</p><p>Mu Guzhu stared for a moment, then exclaimed joyfully, "It's indeed a Fire Jade Centipede, and it's about to enter its late third transformation stage. If the legends are true, it should meet the requirements!"</p>
