<h1>Chapter 2124: Six Harmonies Decree</h1><p>“Reporting to Clan Leader, the Tainted Qi shows signs of receding!”</p><p>The clan elder reported in a low voice, his heart filled with trepidation, unsure if this was a good time.</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression shifted slightly, and he nodded. “You and Tenth Elder return to the Sacred Lake immediately, and lead the others to the Tainted Lands. Await my command!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>The clan elder accepted the order and left.</p><p>The cave dwelling sealed shut once more. Min Zhuo rose from his meditation mat, gazing eastward with a solemn expression.</p><p>For him, the receding of the Tainted Qi during the battle was the best opportunity. The only imperfection was that the fighting wasn't fierce enough.</p><p>How could he make that Qin Zhenren lose focus?</p><p>Min Zhuo's eyes flickered.</p><p>No matter what, he had to find a way to escape from here, personally go to the Tainted Lands, and retrieve Mount Daiyu!</p><p>He paced back and forth within the cave dwelling, pondering for a long time. He then sat back down on the meditation mat and waited quietly for several days. Upon learning that those who had attempted to breach the formation had returned, he left the cave dwelling and flew towards Lu Wang's imperial carriage.</p><p>The army was arrayed before the carriage, their morale slightly low, suggesting that the battle hadn't yielded favorable results.</p><p>Sweeping his gaze across the ranks, Min Zhuo saw some familiar faces, all elites of the Changyou Clan. However, many familiar faces were also missing.</p><p>A year ago, the Changyou Clan elites were incorporated into Lu Wang's army and suffered heavy losses in the great war. The number of fallen experts might have exceeded that of the past century. He himself had fought many times and had even been injured. This was the price they had to pay, though the Siyou Clan's losses were even greater.</p><p>Stepping into the carriage, Min Zhuo heard someone describing the battle situation. He quietly entered the main hall, where Lu Wang and several Siyou Clan experts looked over and nodded to him amicably.</p><p>In this assault on the Storm Realm, Min Zhuo had not only sent his clan members to fight but had also never shirked his own duty. While his contributions might not have been significant, they had earned him the increasing favor of Lu Wang and the others.</p><p>Min Zhuo stood silently to the side, listening to the Siyou Clan expert named Si Lan's account. Learning that they had found a way to counter the Five-Colored Crown, he couldn't help but feel secretly delighted.</p><p>Since the beginning of the war, they hadn't even left the desert, largely due to their apprehension towards the crown. Now that they had found a method to restrain it and were approaching the Great Compassion Monastery, they might launch a full-scale attack when the time was ripe.</p><p>Min Zhuo saw an opportunity, his face betraying no emotion. He wouldn't abruptly jump out and agitate; it was best to use subtle hints to push things forward, lest he arouse suspicion.</p><p>At this moment, as Si Lan finished recounting the details of the fight, everyone looked towards the Grand Preceptor.</p><p>How to break the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art was secondary; what they cared about was whether they could enhance the power of the tokens and truly suppress the crown.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor fell into deep thought. After a moment, everyone sensed a faint fluctuation emanating from his fingertips, as if he already had an idea and was in the process of deduction.</p><p>Lu Wang said softly, “Let us not disturb the Grand Preceptor. Everyone, follow me to the side hall.”</p><p>Arriving at the side hall, Lu Wang said, “Refining treasures is not something that can be accomplished overnight. During this period, I ask everyone to continue probing the power of the enemy's thunderstorm techniques. Clan Leader Min Zhuo…”</p><p>Min Zhuo stepped forward in response.</p><p>“Was the Great Compassion Monastery the leading sect of the Western Lands before?” Lu Wang asked.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Min Zhuo nodded, his voice filled with hatred. “The Western Lands are dominated by Buddhist sects, with the Great Compassion Monastery as their head. The abbot, Master Huaiyin, is the foremost monk of the Western Lands and has slaughtered countless experts of my clan!”</p><p>Lu Wang pondered, “In Clan Leader Min Zhuo's opinion, could one of the three auxiliary altars be hidden within the Great Compassion Monastery?”</p><p>Previously, Lu Wang had informed everyone of the Grand Preceptor's deduction about the Thunder Altar. With a structure of one main and three auxiliary altars, the main altar was most likely located in the Central Continent or the Eastern Sea, while the other three regions each had an auxiliary altar.</p><p>However, the enemy had hidden the auxiliary altars too well, and they had yet to deduce their specific locations. Only by destroying one of these auxiliary altars could they achieve a true victory!</p><p>Hearing these words, Min Zhuo's heart stirred. Feigning contemplation, he said, “There is indeed some possibility. The Great Compassion Monastery was once on the verge of destruction, and it was only saved thanks to Fairy Liuli. Although it is a Buddhist sect, it has close ties with the Azure Goat Temple. It is rumored that Master Huaiyin and Qin Zhenren also have a connection. There is no force in the Western Lands more trustworthy to Qin Zhenren than the Great Compassion Monastery!”</p><p>Pausing, Min Zhuo continued, “After numerous clashes, fellow Daoists must have also realized that Qin Zhenren is cunning and adept at using strategies of deception. To ordinary people, placing an auxiliary altar in the Great Compassion Monastery seems unwise, but Qin Zhenren might very well do the opposite. These are merely my personal thoughts. I hope Lu Wang will consider them carefully.”</p><p>Having said this, Min Zhuo knew that it was enough. He only needed to plant a seed in everyone's minds, and then he bowed and retreated.</p><p>Those present were all shrewd and experienced individuals. These could be considered reasonable deductions. If he were too eager and made unfounded speculations, it would definitely arouse suspicion.</p><p>As expected, someone nodded slightly, agreeing with Min Zhuo's words.</p><p>“The Great Compassion Monastery holds such a high status. Even if it's not an auxiliary altar, it must house an important formation altar. Conquering the monastery is imperative!” Mountain Lord Mo Shan declared decisively.</p><p>Lu Wang remained noncommittal. As usual, he set the strategy for breaking the formation and then dismissed everyone.</p><p>For nearly two months afterward, Lu Wang's side repeatedly sent people to challenge the formation. When they emerged from the torrential rain once again, the Grand Preceptor finally exited seclusion and produced a new type of token.</p><p>The size and shape of the tokens were similar to before, the difference being that a precious pearl was inlaid at the center of each token, with blue light circulating within.</p><p>“I have named these decrees the Six Harmonies Decrees. The pearl within is called the Six Harmonies Inscription Pearl. It is a set of extraordinary treasures that I obtained by chance. Integrating them into the Six Harmonies Decrees is quite fitting. Everyone, infuse a drop of your lifeblood into the decree and diligently refine it, and this treasure will recognize you as its master. During combat, by activating the Six Harmonies Decrees together, you can restrict that crown!”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor's tone was full of confidence. With a wave of his hand, the decrees flew towards everyone.</p><p>Upon receiving the decrees, some immediately forced out a drop of lifeblood and attempted to refine them, while others cautiously observed for a moment before putting them away.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor looked around at everyone and continued, “I have discussed with His Majesty, and we agree that the Great Compassion Monastery is the leading sect of the Western Lands. Conquering this monastery is of great significance, and we must strive to take it! Fellow Daoist Li…”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor turned his head towards the side of the hall, where a person was sitting on a high chair. This person had a youthful appearance yet gave off a weathered and world-weary aura, as if his edges had been smoothed by the passage of time. Sitting there, he resembled the most ordinary and common person, easily overlooked.</p><p>Of course, the others in the hall would not overlook him.</p><p>This person was named Li Yue, his cultivation having reached the second level of the Emptiness Realm, mid-stage. He wasn't one of Lu Wang's subordinates, nor did he belong to any of the factions under the One Emperor and Four Kings. This person acted discreetly and wasn't particularly renowned within the Siyou Clan, yet all factions would give him some face.</p><p>Initially, everyone was surprised to see Li Yue; Lu Wang had actually managed to invite him.</p><p>During this time, Li Yue had only participated in a few crucial battles, and his performance had lived up to his reputation.</p><p>“What instructions does the Grand Preceptor have?” Li Yue rose, his voice as gentle as his demeanor.</p><p>“This battle is crucial. I request Fellow Daoist Li to lead the army into battle! I will personally provide support for you!” The Grand Preceptor said gravely.</p><p>In the ongoing struggle of over a year, both sides had been exchanging blows and using various means to probe each other's strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>As Lu Wang's army pressed forward step by step, in addition to Qin Sang and Si Lu's companion beasts, a sinister and eerie stone statue and a firebird spirit had subsequently appeared on the battlefield.</p><p>Openly, the Storm Realm had revealed four experts of the Soul Formation Realm.</p><p>With the army about to reach the gates, if Qin Zhenren intended to defend the Great Compassion Monastery at all costs, it was time to reveal any remaining hidden cards!</p><p>The one they were most wary of was the elusive Attendant Xia. The Grand Preceptor had been waiting for him to appear.</p><p>Li Yue nodded slightly, readily agreeing, “I will do my utmost!”</p><p>He then looked at everyone and bowed, saying, “I ask for the full support of all fellow Daoists!”</p><p>With the commander appointed, the next step was to deploy the troops. A ball of white light flew out from the Grand Preceptor's sleeve, revealing a jade slip.</p><p>With a touch of divine sense, the contents of the jade slip appeared in the void.</p><p>Everyone's gaze was drawn to it, their eyes fixed on the intricate formation displayed.</p><p>“Thanks to everyone repeatedly venturing into the thunderstorm to investigate, His Majesty and I have deduced a method to break it, which is to counter formation with formation! Unless Qin Zhenren has other hidden variations, with this formation, we have more than a seventy percent chance of success. However…”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor paused, waiting for everyone to understand the formation, then continued, “This formation has a critical eye position that requires a powerful expert to occupy at all times. Once the formation is activated, this position cannot be concealed and will be the most likely target for the enemy. I wonder if any fellow Daoist is willing to volunteer? I will surely offer a handsome reward!”</p><p>Silence fell upon the imperial carriage.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor's meaning was clear. If Attendant Xia remained hidden and chose to strike, he would undoubtedly target the formation eye first. At that time, with the formation engaged against the thunderstorm, others would find it difficult to protect the formation eye, making it the most perilous position.</p><p>While a handsome reward was tempting, one's own safety was paramount. No one wanted to stumble at the finish line after coming so far.</p><p>No one responded.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor was disappointed. Just as he was about to appoint a trusted aide to take on this task, he saw Min Zhuo step forward from the crowd.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor was overjoyed. “Clan Leader Min Zhuo wishes to occupy the formation eye?”</p><p>Min Zhuo said, “Indeed! I am willing to accept this task. The monks of the Great Compassion Monastery have stained their hands with the blood of my clan. I have sworn to slaughter all those bald donkeys and raze all their monasteries to the ground, to appease the spirits of my fallen clansmen!”</p><p>He then bowed again and added, “That person commanded me to assist Lu Wang with all my might, but Lu Wang has numerous powerful experts under his command, and I have yet to find a chance to prove myself. I can't help but feel anxious. After this matter is concluded, I request that the Grand Preceptor put in a good word for me before that person.”</p><p>Even now, Min Zhuo still didn't know the true identity of 'that person', only guessing at their origins based on Zai Zhen's hints. But it didn't prevent him from bringing up 'that person' to justify his actions.</p><p>The Tainted Qi was about to recede, and he had to escape quickly. Being seriously injured on the battlefield and retreating to the rear for healing was the most justifiable and least suspicious reason.</p><p>However, these experts were all discerning, and feigning injury wouldn't work. He had to find an opportunity!</p><p>Now, the opportunity had arrived.</p><p>Min Zhuo believed that the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability couldn't be that simple. Even if it was countered, there must be a way to escape. He specifically mentioned 'that person' to increase his weight in the Grand Preceptor's mind.</p><p>For Mount Daiyu, it was worth the gamble!</p><p>Sure enough, the Grand Preceptor didn't suspect anything.</p><p>He didn't know that Min Zhuo had never directly interacted with that person. From his perspective, Min Zhuo's fawning and obedience towards that person was perfectly normal. The Changyou Clan had already offended the Zhuyan Clan, and in this territory, only that person could protect them. Min Zhuo had no other choice.</p><p>The others didn't know what riddles Min Zhuo and the Grand Preceptor were playing, aware that it must involve some great secret. They pretended not to hear, lest they attract trouble.</p><p>…</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>West of the Great Compassion Monastery.</p><p>Four figures hovered in the void.</p><p>Among them were Qin Sang and Si Lu's Frost Weasel, along with a black stone statue and a firebird.</p><p>The stone statue was sent by Su Nu. It was similar to a puppet that could be remotely controlled. It was called the Stone Ghost Warrior and possessed considerable strength.</p><p>The firebird was a manifestation of Zhu Que.</p><p>They gazed westward and saw shadowy figures beyond the curtain of rain. The battle formation resembled a sky-obscuring dark cloud, advancing towards the rain.</p><p>Countless soldiers had been dispatched by Lu Wang this time, and who knew how many experts were hidden within the ranks. One thing was certain: this was the largest offensive since the war began!</p><p>The enemy clearly came with the determination to win.</p><p>“Brother Qin’s divine calculations are accurate. The enemy is indeed launching a major assault,” the stone statue’s mouth opened and closed, transmitting Su Nu’s crisp and melodious voice.</p><p>Qin Sang showed no sign of complacency; this wasn't difficult to guess.</p><p>The enemy had found a way to counter the Five Elements Divine Light and had also arrived near the Great Compassion Monastery. It was highly likely they would launch an all-out attack.</p><p>“Hee hee…”</p><p>Zhu Que’s manifestation, ever the one to revel in chaos, let out an excited chuckle. “It’s a pity they don’t know you cultivate both body and dharma, possessing not only a Dharma Image but also a Dharma Body, and the Dharma Body's strength far surpasses the Dharma Image!”</p><p>Su Nu also laughed. “This time, they’re definitely in for a big surprise. I wonder if we can eliminate a few first!”</p><p>“Difficult!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “Killing companion beasts is easy, killing people is not!”</p><p>He stared at the rolling green mountains beyond the curtain of rain. Having sensed something amiss earlier, he had switched the positions of his Dharma Body and Dharma Image, leaving the Dharma Image to preside over the main altar while the Dharma Body returned.</p><p>While seemingly the same physical body, they were now fundamentally different.</p><p>The thunder talismans were inscribed into the formation altar, and it was the Thunder Altar, not Qin Sang himself, that executed the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Grand Art. The Dharma Image could also activate it.</p><p>While the enemy sought a way to counter the Five Elements Divine Light, Qin Sang was also devising ways to prevent their rescue. Though he had achieved some success, he still felt that this wasn't the full extent of that mysterious land's power.</p><p>With the Dharma Body's emergence, if all went well, this might be the final test.</p><p>The Great Compassion Monastery held a special status in the Western Lands, and Qin Sang knew the enemy would strive to conquer it. He retreated all the way to the monastery's exterior, intending to use this opportunity to make a move!</p><p>Now it seemed that the situation was developing as he had anticipated. Unfortunately, there had been a slight unexpected development: the Tainted Qi was receding during this period.</p><p>“The enemy is entering!”</p><p>Among the four, the most tense was Si Lu, who hurriedly alerted them upon seeing the vanguard of Lu Wang's army enter the rain.</p><p>Once the vanguard had fully entered the rain, it would be their turn to act.</p><p>Qin Sang’s lips moved slightly, transmitting instructions. His figure flickered, and he took the lead, diving into the depths of the torrential rain, vanishing without a trace in an instant. The other three figures also disappeared.</p>
