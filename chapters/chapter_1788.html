<h1>Chapter 1779: A Visit</h1><p>In the hall,</p><p>Grandmaster Qi and an elderly man with a red face, wearing a robe adorned with thunder patterns, sat facing each other.  They were old acquaintances.</p><p>Grandmaster Qi got straight to the point.  "I've come to ask Elder Li for a favor."</p><p>The red-faced elder laughed heartily. "I just told my attendant that you wouldn't come unless you needed something!"</p><p>Grandmaster Qi showed a hint of embarrassment.</p><p>The red-faced elder, after teasing his old friend, turned serious.  "What important matter is it, friend?  Is it related to this young friend?"</p><p>The red-faced elder looked at the young Daoist standing silently behind Grandmaster Qi. He recognized most of Grandmaster Qi's disciples and attendants, but he had never seen this one before.  Unbeknownst to him, the young Daoist was Qin Sang, disguised as a disciple of Master Mingyue, accompanying Grandmaster Qi.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Li," Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>This Elder Li was an elder of the Right Thunder Prefecture.</p><p>Grandmaster Qi nodded. "You have sharp eyes, friend. He is the disciple of an old friend of mine. As you can see, his cultivation has reached the peak of the Morality Dharma Position, ready for a breakthrough, but he hasn't been granted second-order Dharma powers yet."</p><p>Elder Li had already guessed, so he wasn't surprised.  He said kindly, "May I ask when this young friend was initiated? Those initiated in our Right Thunder Prefecture are clearly destined for our sect. Even if they are not our sect's disciples, as long as they haven't done anything detrimental to our sect, the sect won't make things difficult during the advancement ceremony."</p><p>He examined Qin Sang carefully.</p><p>"He's not an initiate of the Right Thunder Prefecture; otherwise, there'd be no need to trouble you," Grandmaster Qi shook his head.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Elder Li pondered. "I wonder where he initially received his Dharma powers? You should know that the High Celestial Thunder lineage of our sect is long-standing and not comparable to ordinary Dharma powers. Even within the Thunder Department, not all Dharma powers can be advanced in our sect; only a few are barely compatible."</p><p>Grandmaster Qi said meaningfully, "His initial Dharma powers are precisely the High Celestial Thunder powers."</p><p>Elder Li was slightly startled, then understood immediately.</p><p>In Jushan, besides the Right Thunder Prefecture, only the Left Thunder Prefecture granted High Celestial Thunder powers.</p><p>This young man was an initiate of the Left Thunder Prefecture, yet he sought advancement in the Right Thunder Prefecture.  There was only one possibility: he or his master had offended the Left Thunder Prefecture.</p><p>Elder Li hesitated.</p><p>The Right and Left Thunder Prefectures were not on good terms; he was happy to cause some trouble for the Left Thunder Prefecture, but if this young man's master had a major feud with the Left Thunder Prefecture, helping him could lead to an open conflict between the two prefectures, something the sect wouldn't want.</p><p>Grandmaster Qi said solemnly, "Rest assured, friend. This young man has no major karmic entanglements. If any conflict arises, I will take full responsibility."</p><p>Elder Li nodded slightly. He could trust his old friend.</p><p>The fact that Grandmaster Qi was involved made this young man's background worth pondering. Grandmaster Qi was a renowned artifact refiner from Xingdao Xianhu. Many powerful factions had tried to recruit him when he was less famous, but Grandmaster Qi, with his pride, had refused them all. It was rare to see him asking for help.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Elder Li took out a thunder talisman. "Young friend, remember to bring this talisman to our sect on the day of the advancement ceremony in two years."</p><p>"Thank you for your understanding,"</p><p>Grandmaster Qi bowed.</p><p>Qin Sang received the talisman, noticing its similarity to those of the Left Thunder Prefecture, with subtle differences, and also thanked him repeatedly.</p><p>Grandmaster Qi and Elder Li chatted for a while longer before taking their leave.</p><p>Back in Hu Zhong City, Qin Sang bid farewell to Grandmaster Qi, but Grandmaster Qi stopped him. "When your master leaves seclusion, tell him I have something to discuss with him."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised and agreed.</p><p>He wondered what Grandmaster Qi wanted.</p><p>After waiting for a few days, Qin Sang changed his appearance before visiting Grandmaster Qi, only to be led directly to the furnace room. He found Grandmaster Qi disheveled, sitting carelessly in the furnace room.</p><p>Fragments of a true treasure were laid out before him, surrounded by a chaotic pile of spiritual materials.  Most of these materials were rare treasures; anyone else would have been speechless and breathless at the sight.</p><p>Grandmaster Qi's hair was a mess; if his robe hadn't had self-cleaning properties, it would have been in a sorry state too.</p><p>He stared at the scroll, occasionally scratching his head, seeming to ponder something, yet constantly rejecting his own ideas.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Wrong!"</p><p>"Yes, it should be like this! But…"</p><p>Grandmaster Qi was lost in his own world, completely oblivious to Qin Sang at the doorway.</p><p>Qin Sang coughed lightly.</p><p>Grandmaster Qi was startled awake, looked up, his eyes still a little dazed, his consciousness slowly returning.  "Oh! It's Master Mingyue, please sit!"</p><p>He patted the nonexistent dust off himself, put away the scattered items, took out two cushions, and eagerly greeted Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sat opposite him, glancing at the scroll. "Master summoned me urgently; have you had a new epiphany?"</p><p>Only fragments of a true treasure could enthrall Grandmaster Qi like this.</p><p>Grandmaster Qi, however, asked first, "I remember you recently obtained a set of spiritual armor?"</p><p>"Correct, it's this armor."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, a thought flitting through her mind.  She activated the Hui Feng armor, her eyes peering through the faceplate curiously at Master Qi, guessing his intentions.</p><p>Master Qi stared at the Hui Feng armor for a moment, then nodded slightly, a rare hesitant expression on his face.  "After pondering the fragments of the True Treasure for many days, I've conceived an idea, but I'm not entirely certain of its success. This treasure belongs to you, so I must first discuss it with you…"</p><p>"Master, please speak freely," Qin Sang readily replied.</p><p>Master Qi then laid out his plan completely.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. Master Qi had devised a method to utilize the True Treasure fragments.</p><p>It wasn't about repair; Master Qi stated clearly that even with a further increase in his cultivation, repairing the True Treasure was impossible.</p><p>His idea was to integrate the True Treasure fragments into another magical artifact.</p><p>Fusing the two artifacts into one was impossible, but he could link their energies. With luck, this might activate some of the True Treasure fragment's power, greatly enhancing the other artifact.</p><p>However, no one knew how much power remained in the fragments.</p><p>And Master Qi himself lacked confidence.</p><p>If they failed, the artifact would certainly be lost, and the True Treasure fragments might be damaged further, compounding the loss.</p><p>Pseudo-Spiritual Treasures are extremely valuable; a mishap would result in a significant loss. Qin Sang's Hui Feng armor was considered top-notch among her artifacts, making it the most suitable candidate.</p><p>"Based on my judgment, this True Treasure, when intact, was likely a defensive treasure. If you agree, I will use the Hui Feng armor as a base, supplementing it with certain spiritual materials to re-forge a top-tier spiritual armor, aiming for better compatibility with the True Treasure fragments…"</p><p>Master Qi’s gaze towards Qin Sang was somewhat anxious.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang was the owner of the True Treasure fragments. He worried she might take them back and seek out a Daoist refiner.</p><p>Master Qi knew he couldn't compare to the true masters of the Daoist sect, so he could only promise to do his utmost to preserve the fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the True Treasure fragments, and without much hesitation, gave Master Qi a reply that filled him with joy, allowing him to proceed as he saw fit!</p><p>However, Qin Sang made one request, "Master, when refining this treasure, may I assist you with controlling the fire?"</p><p>Saying 'controlling the fire' was actually a way to observe the refining process.</p><p>Qin Sang reasoned that, firstly, it was not easy to find and hire a Daoist master of that caliber, and secondly, the Daoist sect was vast and powerful, likely having seen countless intact True Treasures; they might not take the task seriously, and even if they agreed, they wouldn't let her observe.</p><p>The True Treasure fragments were an unexpected boon. Failure meant only losing a suit of armor, which she could afford.</p><p>Success would yield a spiritual armor with far greater power, along with invaluable refining experience.</p><p>Master Qi would undoubtedly use all his skills this time; Qin Sang would essentially become a close disciple of Master Qi.</p><p>Master Qi was overjoyed, "Thank you for your trust! I need to carefully consider this before I begin. Please stay here for a few more years."</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't be leaving Star Island Lake for a while, waiting for the initiation ceremony of the Liu Jin Huo Ling.  She immediately withdrew the mark within the Hui Feng armor, restoring it to its original form before giving it to Master Qi.</p><p>The Hui Feng armor's base was a small bronze suit of armor, no larger than a palm.</p><p>Master Qi carefully received it, and began discussing the art of refining with Qin Sang.</p><p>Leaving Master Qi's residence, Qin Sang’s next task was simple: to cultivate diligently and await the initiation ceremony.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang finished her cultivation and pondered whether she should visit Sword Heart Island.</p><p>The time she'd agreed upon with the Sword Master had passed, and now that she had received a first-order spell and had a clear path to a second-order one, she needed to consider how to obtain a third-order spell.</p><p>The third-order spell of the High Shang Shen Xiao Sect was called the Five Thunder Secret Art.</p><p>As far as she knew, the Left and Right Thunder Palaces of the sect did not bestow the Five Thunder Secret Art; as the Sword Master said, it was possible that it was not just a matter of it not being openly taught, but that they were simply incapable of doing so.</p><p>"I should visit the Sword Master,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang flew out of Hu Zhong Island and headed north, arriving at a relatively empty expanse of water after two days.</p><p>The center of this water area contained only a small circular island.</p><p>The island was covered in a type of spirit tree called Sword Heart Orchid, which gave the island its name.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the Sword Heart Orchids from afar, resembling countless sharp swords pointing towards the sky, standing upright.</p><p>Before she approached, ripples suddenly appeared in the water, and a water-formed spiritual sword shot out, blocking Qin Sang's path. A stern voice commanded, "Halt!"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped her flight, and saw a somewhat stooped old man in black robes flying out from Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, the old man's eyes lit up, "Could you be Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>"It is I. I came at the Sword Master's invitation. May I ask for your name?" Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>An elderly man bowed deeply.  "My master is in seclusion. I await Qingfeng Daozhang on my master's orders.  I was simply lacking in observation just now; please forgive me, Daozhang."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>This elderly man was a late-Yuan Ying cultivator, yet he called himself a humble servant. Such humility.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't underestimate him because of his subservient demeanor.</p><p>Learning from the elder that the Sword Master would be in seclusion for some time, Qin Sang prevented him from disturbing the Sword Master and settled into a cave dwelling on Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Half a year passed in a flash.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang felt the cave's protective barrier being triggered.  Opening the door, he first heard a hearty laugh.</p><p>The Sword Master, smiling broadly, strode in. "I've kept you waiting... eh?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the Sword Master was taken aback, then scrutinized him carefully. "Since our last meeting, you seem to have made great progress?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, *This person's eye for talent is indeed sharp,* and smiled without answering, inviting him to sit.</p><p>The Sword Master sighed. "I heard from Valley Boat Daoist about you. For decades, you've been in seclusion at Crane Cry Mountain, unconcerned with worldly affairs. Your unwavering resolve is admirable.  Several years ago, after attending to some matters, I intended to visit you at Crane Cry Mountain, but then received your letter, so I waited for you here in this cave. I wouldn't dare to travel far without your arrival."</p><p>"You overestimate me," Qin Sang said with a questioning look. "Is there something you need?"</p><p>The Sword Master shook his head. "I owe you a great debt of gratitude, and it weighs heavily on my mind. If you ever need anything, please do not hesitate to ask!  Also, I'd like to introduce you to several experts, fellow cultivators of compatible temperaments. They are all reclusive individuals, however, and may not be to your liking."</p><p>Since they were friends of the Sword Master, their cultivation base must be considerable.  Qin Sang was certainly interested.</p><p>First the tribulation, then the ascension, Qin Sang had been occupied with these two matters and hadn't had the chance to interact properly with the strong cultivators of this realm.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an unspoken implication in the Sword Master's words. Since the other party wasn't clarifying, he wouldn't pry.</p><p>After agreeing to a meeting time, Qin Sang changed the subject. "I do have something I wish to ask you, Daoist."</p><p>The Sword Master straightened up, listening intently.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully asked, "Could you tell me about the process of obtaining a third-order technique?"</p><p>He had already investigated and found that there was no such thing as a sword technique.</p><p>Daoist techniques and the Celestial Gods of the Heavenly Court corresponded, mainly those of the Thunder and Star Departments.  The Star Department encompassed a vast range; for instance, the nine Nine Luminaries Star Lords incorporated the Five Elements and Yin-Yang.  Heavenly Court legends made no mention of a Sword God position.</p><p>Yet the Sword Master hadn't displayed a ritual altar when wielding his sword. Until now, Qin Sang still didn't know what technique the Sword Master cultivated.</p><p>Hearing this, the Sword Master was initially surprised, then astonished.</p><p>"You're not a Daoist lineage descendant?"</p><p>He had told Qin Sang that he obtained his third-order technique from the Daoist Court.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang seemed like a powerful cultivator concealing his strength; he showed no fear even in the Gui Fang Kingdom.  If he were a profound Daoist cultivator, investigating these secrets wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The Sword Master exclaimed that this explained things, and solemnly said, "I did obtain my third-order technique from the Daoist Court! Do you remember what I said in Star Valley? I can tell you with certainty that while there might be hidden sects in the entire Jushan region, I haven't yet discovered any sect altar capable of bestowing third-order techniques!"</p><p>Upon hearing this, the last of Qin Sang's hopes vanished. It seemed he would have to appeal to the Daoist Court.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't try to hide his intentions, and the Sword Master naturally understood, explaining straightforwardly, "Within the Daoist tradition, the Daoist Court and the Taoist temples should be viewed separately.  If you have affinity with a particular sect, obtaining eligibility is easier, but temples only possess their own inheritances, which may not be suitable for everyone.  You should know that switching techniques mid-way, even if they are of the same path, can lead to an unstable foundation."</p><p>Qin Sang understood the implication.  He exclaimed in surprise, "Does the Daoist Court unify all techniques under heaven?"</p><p>The Sword Master shook his head slightly. "Only the celestial officials of the Daoist Court know for certain!  However, I did receive the third-order technique I desired from the Daoist Court. Even if I hadn't, with the Daoist Court's capabilities, they could find the most suitable third-order technique for you; there's no doubt about that!"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, once again sensing the Daoist Court's powerful control over this realm.</p><p>"Obtaining ascension eligibility from the Daoist Court...must be difficult, yes?"</p><p>The Sword Master's tone was deeply meaningful.  "It's both easy and difficult; it depends on whether you're willing to accept another layer of constraint."</p><p></p>
