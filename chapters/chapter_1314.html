Chapter 1306: The Siege

The Abyssal Ruins.

At this moment, the Abyssal Ruins were experiencing their most violent tremors, and not a single soul could be seen. A streak of crimson light shot into the ruins like a bolt of lightning, vanishing into a sea of mist. Not long after, four more streaks of light arrived in quick succession—Daoist Canghong, Immortal Qiu Zhi, and the others. The crimson light ahead belonged to none other than the fleeing Demon Lord Ye.

"His target is the Palace of Condemned Gods!"

The entrance to the Palace of Condemned Gods lay deep within the misty sea.

"Hurry!"

The four of them wasted no time and plunged into the mist. Suddenly, a thunderous roar erupted from the depths, deafening and soul-shaking. Immediately after, a terrifying wave of energy surged outward, accompanied by an overwhelming pressure.

*Boom...*

The misty sea was thrown into chaos, with countless turbulent currents crashing wildly, each one carrying immense destructive power. This was the epicenter of the Abyssal Ruins' tremors, and now the shaking grew even more violent. Despite being top-tier experts, the four felt suffocated, struggling to stabilize themselves and avoid being swept away by the chaotic currents, lest they become lost in the mist.

At that moment, the four suddenly halted, staring dumbfounded at what lay ahead. Through the thick mist, the faint outline of an Immortal Gate began to emerge. The gate was colossal, towering between heaven and earth. As it manifested, strange phenomena unfolded around it. However, these phenomena were not the auspicious signs of an immortal realm but rather scenes akin to the tortures of the deepest hells—mountains of blades, seas of fire, heavenly thunder, and pools of blood. Every imaginable form of torment was on display, with the condemned writhing in eternal suffering.

Though they knew it was all an illusion, it was still enough to send chills down their spines.

The Immortal Gate was tightly shut, and at its center was a crimson ancient character: "罪" (Condemnation). Surrounded by the horrifying phenomena, the character glowed an eerie, blood-red hue.

In the next moment, the Immortal Gate trembled, and under the stunned gazes of the four, it slowly cracked open. But before it could fully open, with a deafening *boom*, the gate slammed shut once more. In that split second, an inconspicuous crimson shadow darted through the gap and into the gate.

"Demon Lord Ye has entered!"

A cultivator surnamed Shan exclaimed in shock.

The group was left dumbfounded, finally understanding why Demon Lord Ye had dared to defy the world. He had already secured a safe haven, an absolute sanctuary!

Since ancient times, such a thing had never happened. The Immortal Gate of the Palace of Condemned Gods only opened when the Purple Palace emerged. No one had ever been able to open it on their own. Demon Lord Ye was the first!

Until the next emergence of the Purple Palace, no one could pursue him into the Palace of Condemned Gods.

The shadow of the Immortal Gate gradually faded.

The four shouted in alarm and rushed toward the gate's location, but by the time they arrived, it had already vanished. All that remained was a massive vortex of mist. Standing at the edge of the vortex, their expressions varied, but none dared to enter. The vortex was filled with chaotic currents that could easily tear any intruder to shreds.

The entrance to the Palace of Condemned Gods—the Immortal Gate—was usually hidden deep within the vortex. Only when the Purple Palace emerged and triggered the ancient restrictions would the gate appear and open.

"How did Demon Lord Ye do it?"

Daoist Canghong muttered to himself, unable to believe what he had just witnessed.

They began to experiment, trying to summon the Immortal Gate, but no matter what they tried, the vortex remained unresponsive, and the gate showed no sign of reappearing.

The four were disheartened. Demon Lord Ye had committed countless atrocities, yet they were powerless to stop him.

"Demon Lord Ye's intentions are unclear. We must guard against his return, but the situation in Yu City is critical. Fellow Daoist Qi and the others are no match for the True One Daoist alone."

A trace of weariness appeared on Daoist Canghong's brow. This was a true crisis, with internal strife and external threats. The Heavenly Elder was still severely injured, and he alone could not handle everything.

After a moment of contemplation, Daoist Canghong instructed, "Fellow Daoist Shan, you two stay here and keep watch. Immortal Qiu Zhi, I recall that your sect's Heaven-Spanning Locking Formation has the power to trap individuals. Set it up here as a precaution in case Demon Lord Ye tries to force his way out. We'll make further arrangements once we've sorted out the chaos."

Immortal Qiu Zhi nodded. "I'll go retrieve the formation disk immediately. Daoist Canghong, you must return to Yu City quickly to stabilize morale. The chaos in the city won't escape the notice of the Two Realms Alliance, and they certainly won't miss this golden opportunity..."

Though they had weathered many storms, even this unprecedented upheaval did not leave them panicked. They methodically prioritized their tasks, addressing the most urgent matters first.

As Daoist Canghong and Immortal Qiu Zhi flew out of the Abyssal Ruins, they saw a young Golden Core cultivator pacing frantically like an ant on a hot pan, his face filled with anxiety.

"Seniors, something terrible has happened..."

Upon seeing them, the young man hurried over and urgently relayed a few words.

Daoist Canghong's expression changed drastically, his earlier composure completely gone.

...

Yu City.

The lotus had vanished.

The city's protective formation had been shattered!

Cultivator Qi had led his forces to retreat into the inner city.

The outer city, having endured the ravages of war, was now a wasteland, bearing no resemblance to its former prosperity. The armies of the Two Realms Alliance were gathering here, preparing for their next move.

The enemy was at the gates!

The inner city was the original Yu City, and it still possessed an intact ancient defensive formation, which Cultivator Qi had activated. Above the inner city, a golden, semi-circular barrier now enveloped it like a turtle shell, firmly protecting the city.

The Two Realms Alliance was in no rush to attack. Their Nascent Soul cultivators gathered to discuss their next steps. The internal strife within the Sin Abyss had already claimed more than half of their top experts. Defeating them was only a matter of time, but they had to be wary of the Sin Abyss making a desperate last stand. No one wanted to fall on the eve of victory.

Inside the inner city.

The Sin Abyss's Nascent Soul cultivators also gathered in a grand hall, but unlike the high spirits of the Two Realms Alliance, the atmosphere here was heavy with tension. Those who had taken the Withering Origin Pills and were now suffering from the backlash were slowly deteriorating in both body and spirit. Faced with an uncertain future for themselves and their sects, their faces were dark, and they remained silent.

Cultivator Qi silently observed their expressions, well aware that morale had hit rock bottom. He could guess what was on their minds.

Previously, they had been willing to take the initiative and enter the battlefield to refine the Withering Origin Pills. But now that they knew the pills were a trap, what was the point of continuing to fight?

However, the situation had reversed. The Two Realms Alliance held the upper hand.

If the roles were reversed, and they had been the ones suppressed for over a century, they too would want to vent their frustrations. Whether or not the war could be stopped was no longer up to them.

The reason no one had spoken up yet was that they were all waiting for news from Daoist Canghong. They still held onto a sliver of hope that he could capture or kill Demon Lord Ye, potentially turning the tide and finding a way to resolve the Withering Origin Pills' side effects.

Of course, capturing Demon Lord Ye alive and forcing him to reveal his plans would be even better.

Demon Lord Ye had been scheming for centuries, manipulating the world and plotting something grand. It was likely related to some unimaginable treasure or an opportunity to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage—or even beyond.

Compared to that, the outcome of this war seemed almost insignificant.
