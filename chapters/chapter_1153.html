<h1>Chapter 1145: The Retreat</h1><p>The commotion caused by the phantom of the Azure Phoenix was too overwhelming, and it had already been detected by the demonic beasts. If they delayed any longer, they would be trapped like turtles in a jar. The falcon demon, restrained by Qin Sang, couldn't move an inch. Desperate to escape but unable to do so, it grew frantic as Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>Qin Sang snapped out of his daze, realizing that he had to leave immediately. He couldn't afford to break through here. While enduring the impact of the Azure Phoenix's power, Qin Sang had sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough. The "Heavenly Demon Refinement Technique" had a strong chance of advancing to the fourth layer. However, comprehending the Heavenly Demon's manifestation required time and couldn't be achieved in an instant. By the time he began his breakthrough, the Demon King Qianji would have already arrived.</p><p>"Let's go!" Qin Sang made a decisive decision.</p><p>His expression darkened as he exerted all his strength to suppress the power of the Azure Phoenix and stabilize his phoenix wings. Fortunately, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was also absorbing the energy, helping to share the burden. For now, Qin Sang could still manage, forcing himself to multitask. On one hand, he silently recited his cultivation technique to regulate the chaotic energy within his body, and on the other, he fled for his life.</p><p>In a flash, his figure appeared at the entrance of the treasure vault. Within the azure light of his escape, streaks of silver shimmered, accompanied by the sound of thunder. The speed was beyond Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>"This is Thunder Escape..." Qin Sang was momentarily stunned. After his wings merged with the power of the Azure Phoenix, he had somehow instinctively grasped the Thunder Escape technique. It was an unexpected boon.</p><p>His speed had become even faster than before. However, this state couldn't last long. The power of the Azure Phoenix could spiral out of control at any moment, potentially shattering his phoenix wings.</p><p>"Big brother! Master! We have no grudges between us. I beg you, show mercy and release the restriction on me. I won't trouble you, I can escape on my own!" The falcon demon suddenly changed its tone, pleading desperately.</p><p>Just moments ago, it had been cursing vehemently, but now it was addressing Qin Sang as "master." This little demon truly knew when to bend and when to stand firm!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't bear to look at it. With a flick of his finger, he released the restriction on the falcon demon and rushed out of the tunnel. He saw that the private chambers of the Demon King's favorite concubine had already been destroyed, reduced to ruins with dust and smoke billowing everywhere.</p><p>Keeping the falcon demon alive might prove useful later. He could interrogate it about the Boundless Valley and search for the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld. Among the Ten Divine Trees, one could never have too many. However, taking the falcon demon with him was out of the question. Its survival would depend on its own luck.</p><p>The falcon demon, now free, followed closely behind Qin Sang as they rushed out of the tunnel. Its eyes flickered as it suddenly realized that the aura within Qin Sang's body held an immense allure for it. Its entire bloodline was stirring with excitement. The phantom of the Azure Phoenix within the stone slab was the true object of its desire. But for now, the falcon demon only sought to survive, with no thoughts of treasure hunting.</p><p>The lesser demons noticed the disturbance and began shouting, charging toward them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't pause for a moment, his eyes fixed on the exit of the formation.</p><p>"Seeking death!" The white-feathered eagle was the first to spot Qin Sang and flew into a rage.</p><p>It had been tasked with guarding the Demon King's palace, and yet, at this very moment, a thief had managed to infiltrate it. The location of the incident made the white-feathered eagle's head spin—it was the private quarters of the Demon King's favorite concubine! It didn't even know whether the concubine was alive or dead. The thought of the Demon King's wrath and the consequences it would face made the white-feathered eagle wish it could devour the intruder alive.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A white shadow shot forward, leaving the lesser demons far behind.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a gust of wind as the white-feathered eagle intercepted him.</p><p>The eagle let out a piercing screech, its voice shaking the heavens, filled with fury.</p><p>Demonic energy surged as its claws became like sharp swords, and its wings transformed into long blades. The white-feathered eagle multiplied into countless shadows, and in an instant, a storm of blades and swords filled the sky, an awe-inspiring sight.</p><p>At this moment, the power of the Azure Phoenix within Qin Sang's body was on the verge of exploding. Desperate to escape and find a place to break through, Qin Sang couldn't afford to hold back.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A sword light shot out, swift as a meteor.</p><p>The white-feathered eagle's heart filled with alarm. Before it could react, the space before it was filled with cold, glinting points of light. To its horror, it found its attacks instantly dismantled, and then it was struck by the sword's momentum.</p><p>The eagle's mind was overwhelmed by the sword's force, its body stiffening in terror.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>A cry of pain echoed.</p><p>The white-feathered eagle was sent flying by Qin Sang, blood spraying across the sky, feathers scattering everywhere. It was severely injured. At the last moment, the eagle mustered all its strength to save its life, narrowly avoiding death by the sword.</p><p>This was also due to Qin Sang's unwillingness to waste time on it.</p><p>The spirit sword cleared the path!</p><p>Qin Sang's figure didn't pause for even a moment.</p><p>The lesser demons only saw a blur before them, and then their target was gone.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang burst out of the formation, then abruptly changed direction, shooting upward into the sky.</p><p>At that moment, a thunderous roar echoed in Qin Sang's ears, shaking his mind.</p><p>"Get down here!"</p><p>Demon King Qianji!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart raced. He had finally drawn the Demon King's attention.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a streak of rainbow light shooting toward him from the direction of the banquet. The demonic energy was overwhelming, the red light blazing, a clear sign of the Demon King's fury.</p><p>As the voice reached him, Qin Sang felt a heavy pressure descend upon him, the Demon King's aura bearing down.</p><p>Simultaneously, a gray mist condensed in the air, and Qin Sang felt as though he had entered a swamp. His escape light dimmed, and his speed began to slow.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was beset by troubles both internal and external.</p><p>"Break!" Qin Sang's face twisted, his voice hoarse with desperation.</p><p>The Ebony Sword seemed to sense its master's urgency, its ringing becoming sharp and mournful. A sword array formed around Qin Sang in an instant.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword array erupted, a pillar of light shooting into the sky.</p><p>The surrounding gray mist was swept away by the sword array.</p><p>Above the Ten Thousand Serpents Abyss, the guards were tightly stationed. Just as they were about to intercept Qin Sang, the pillar of light blasted through their formation, creating an opening. The formation was thrown into chaos, and Qin Sang didn't look back, charging straight out of the abyss.</p><p>It was the dead of night, and the world was silent, but the peace was shattered.</p><p>Within the abyss, Demon King Qianji was momentarily stunned. His failure to capture the thief was unexpected, leaving him both shocked and suspicious.</p><p>This thief gave him a very strange feeling. Despite exuding an incredibly pure demonic aura, his swordsmanship rivaled that of the most elite human sword cultivators. His aura was even more peculiar—it didn't resemble that of a transformed great demon or a human Nascent Soul cultivator. Yet, he showed no fear of the Demon King's pressure, easily dispelling his divine abilities, and his escape technique was something even Demon King Qianji couldn't match.</p><p>Such strength shouldn't belong to someone at the Golden Core stage.</p><p>"A great demon who has been injured, or... a trap?" Demon King Qianji couldn't help but speculate.</p><p>Suddenly, Demon King Qianji recalled the thief's aura, finding it strangely familiar.</p><p>"The stone slab! The Azure Phoenix! Could it be that the thief possesses the bloodline of the Azure Phoenix and has stolen the stone slab?"</p><p>After obtaining the stone slab, Demon King Qianji had tried every method to uncover its secrets but failed. He had eventually placed it in the treasure vault, nearly forgetting about it. He never expected that a descendant of the Azure Phoenix still existed in the world.</p><p>Somehow, news of the mysterious stone slab had leaked.</p><p>Realizing that this wasn't a trap but the theft of a priceless treasure, Demon King Qianji couldn't allow the thief to escape so easily. His eyes glinted coldly as he let out a cold snort, chasing after Qin Sang as he fled the Ten Thousand Serpents Abyss.</p><p>The falcon demon, born with the innate ability of Thunder Escape, and with Qin Sang drawing all the attention, managed to slip out unnoticed.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had released the restriction on it, the falcon demon felt no gratitude. After all, the entire situation had been caused by Qin Sang. However, seeing Qin Sang repel the white-feathered eagle and break through the Demon King's blockade in one swift motion, the falcon demon couldn't help but marvel at his strength.</p>
