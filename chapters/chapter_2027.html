<h1>Chapter 2018: A Millennium Too Late</h1><p>A sharp point jutted out from the fragment of the Ziwei Palace, directly in front of Qin Sang and Qu Zhen.  Qin Sang was looking at a broken mountain on the edge of the fragment, to the right of the point.  A mostly collapsed palace stood on the mountain; a figure emerged from the palace and headed deeper inside.</p><p>Qin Sang only glimpsed the figure, yet the familiar feeling intensified.</p><p>"Find somewhere to hide," Qin Sang instructed Qu Zhen, not waiting for a reply before transforming into a streak of lightning and rushing towards the broken mountain.</p><p>Qu Zhen opened his mouth to speak, feeling a little disheartened that Qin Sang wouldn't take him.  However, considering the dangers within this Sword Pavilion, he secretly rejoiced that Qin Sang hadn't used him as a scout. He looked around and vanished into the dark void.</p><p>From the outside, it appeared as a thin fog. Upon entering, however, the mist revealed an unknown energy significantly obstructing vision and spiritual sense. It wasn’t an emergency, so Qin Sang didn't awaken her Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>As she approached the broken mountain, a fierce gust of wind suddenly struck.</p><p>Qin Sang's sword light flashed, and her Huiying Sword sliced out, meeting a grey short dagger.  With a ‘clink’, the dagger snapped in two, the pieces dissolving into white vapor mid-air.</p><p>This demonstrated the pervasive danger within the Ziwei Palace fragment.  Undeterred, Qin Sang's speed increased, and within a few blinks she had reached the top of the broken mountain.</p><p>After surveying the palace, Qin Sang flew to the broken edge, scanning her surroundings. The fog ahead was thick, and the figure had vanished. However, the ancient prohibitions within the Ziwei Palace fragment made it almost impossible to pass through unnoticed, leaving no trace.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately locked onto a faint energy fluctuation and pursued without hesitation.</p><p>She remembered a large expanse of unknown towering ancient trees behind this mountain; their lush green leaves, like crystals, emitted a pure green light, forming a tangible light membrane above the trees—a clear sign of a manifested ancient prohibition for experienced cultivators.</p><p>Now, not a single tree remained.  Everything was scorched black, with occasional dead stumps, looking like it had been ravaged by fire.  The light membrane was gone.</p><p>Qin Sang cut a path with her sword light, quickly traversing the dead forest.  Soon, however, she noticed the energy fluctuation becoming intermittent and constantly shifting direction. The other party had undoubtedly sensed pursuit and was trying to evade her.</p><p>"Friend, wait…" Qin Sang channeled her true energy, transmitting her voice.  But there was no response.</p><p>The ancient prohibitions blocked the transmission, extending only a short distance.  Qin Sang had no choice but to continue the pursuit, finally unleashing her Qingluan True Lightning.</p><p>Using the Qingluan True Lightning for lightning-遁术 (escape technique), her speed surpassed almost all cultivators of her level.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A lightning bolt pierced the mist at incredible speed. Qin Sang finally sensed a stronger energy signature and vaguely saw a green glow, disappearing into a valley.</p><p>As she neared the valley, the green glow suddenly accelerated, rushing towards the right side of the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang pursued into the valley, losing her target again. The right slope was riddled with cracks; the figure had vanished into one of them.  However, Qin Sang was too fast. Despite the figure’s efforts at concealment, residual energy fluctuations remained in the crack.</p><p>She followed into the crack, finding the mountain severely fractured and riddled with fissures. Worse, it wasn't an ordinary mountain; each stone was infused with prohibitions, making the rock incredibly hard even when cracked.  It was impossible to shatter it.</p><p>Qin Sang could only follow the energy trail through the maze of cracks, her pursuer clearly familiar with the terrain, having been there before.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>Their subterranean chase caused the mountain to tremble, the vibrations attracting attention from nearby cultivators.</p><p>Cultivators who were breaking ancient prohibitions stopped, looking over.  They could roughly guess what was happening and decided to observe rather than interfere.</p><p>The underground chase raged on.  The figure repeatedly used the ancient prohibitions as obstacles, but Qin Sang countered them all. Her speed advantage was gradually closing the distance.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang sensed the crack’s end, the figure having already left.  With a flash of lightning, she burst from the crack.</p><p>The moment she emerged, a furious roar echoed from above, followed by an intensely cold aura descending from the sky.</p><p>A black, pointed, magical artifact, resembling a sharp cone, hung in the air.  Its extreme sharpness caused ripples in the void, as if piercing even empty space.</p><p>From its appearance to the eruption of energy, it happened in an instant.  The ambient energy surged, transforming into a gloomy black current, rushing down like a waterfall, amplifying the cone's power.</p><p>The cone was aimed directly at Qin Sang's Baihui acupoint.  A direct hit would undoubtedly pierce his body.</p><p>But Qin Sang, seemingly anticipating this, stood his ground.  His Gray Warbler sword hummed, and a brilliant sword light shot upwards.</p><p>The dazzling sword energy appeared instantly beneath the cone, seemingly piercing the void, and counter-attacked.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>Like a collision of black and white suns, they merged into a larger, more powerful entity.  The shockwave spread in all directions with tremendous force.</p><p>Within this "sun," the Gray Warbler sword slashed, narrowly avoiding the tip of the cone and striking its body.  With a thud, the cone veered sharply, and the ambient energy it had gathered began to dissipate.</p><p>However, the attack wasn't limited to the cone.  A green light shot into the air, transforming into a dark green jade bracelet. The bracelet rapidly expanded, forming a black vortex at its center—heavy, violent, capable of tearing everything apart, even more terrifying than the cone.</p><p>Just as the bracelet was about to descend, Qin Sang's voice, tinged with surprise, echoed from below.</p><p>"Friend Su Nu, is it really you?!"</p><p>As they expected, the appearance of the Sword Pavilion had attracted cultivators from the lower realms. After the ancient artifact, the Jade Heart Blade, Qin Sang had encountered an old friend!</p><p>Su Nu of the Canglang Sea!</p><p>This woman left a deep impression on Qin Sang.  Due to her unique constitution, she was chosen by the Three Great Merchant Alliances to be a vessel for an ancient demon, a fate far more desperate than his own.</p><p>Yet she never gave up, stubbornly fighting for survival, even becoming another's soul slave to carve a path to freedom. She played a crucial role in sealing the ancient demon.</p><p>After the demon sealing battle, Qin Sang, returning to Xiao Han Domain, entrusted the severely injured and unconscious Su Nu to the Four Sacred Palaces, destroying the soul-control seal.</p><p>Returning to the Canglang Sea after reaching the Transcendence stage, he learned from Bao Zhengnan's siblings that Su Nu had failed to escape during her ascension from the Seven Killing Hall and disappeared.</p><p>Below the black and white sun, Qin Sang looked up, his gaze fixed on the figure above, his expression strange.</p><p>Her face gradually merged with his memory.  Less youthful, more mature and sophisticated, but her determination remained unchanged.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu again shocked Qin Sang.  She was now a Void Refinement cultivator!</p><p>Considering Su Nu was younger than him, and he only achieved his current cultivation after Lei Zu's body tempering in the Talisman Realm, how did she do it?</p><p>What incredible talent!</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had predicted that given the chance, Su Nu's nature would lead her to remarkable achievements.  Indeed, during her time in the Four Sacred Palaces, her cultivation progressed rapidly, contributing greatly to humanity.</p><p>No one expected Su Nu to already have broken through to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang spoke, Su Nu, her identity revealed, stiffened slightly. The cone and bracelet's attack faltered, transforming into two black lights that flew back, their power dissipating.</p><p>Su Nu, a look of disbelief on her face, gazed downwards.  She clearly remembered Qin Sang. Upon seeing his face, her expression changed, and she exclaimed,</p><p>"Qin… friend, is that you?!"</p><p>"Long time no see, friend.  You still remember me," Qin Sang said with relief.</p><p>After recognizing Qin Sang, intense joy flashed in Su Nu's eyes. Her lips moved, about to speak, when she sensed disturbances in the distance—others were approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed them; evidently, they were trying to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>"Friend Qin, this isn't the place to talk. Come with me," Su Nu, seemingly familiar with the area, quickly led Qin Sang away from the fragment of the Purple Micro Palace, towards a scene of illusory divine power.</p><p>After flying for a while, ensuring they weren't followed, Su Nu landed on a cracked piece of land, turning to Qin Sang.</p><p>Her emotions had calmed down.  Her gaze lingered on Qin Sang's face, and she opened her mouth, unsure where to begin.  "I inadvertently made a couple of enemies.  To avoid them, I was forced to close myself off for a while before coming out."</p><p>"I didn't know it was Qin Dao You before," she said, "I thought it was an enemy still chasing me."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly thought, "No wonder. When Su Nu made her move, her aura seemed a little sluggish."  "I just arrived here," she replied, "I only caught a glimpse and wasn't sure if it was you."</p><p>Su Nu nodded, paused, then said softly, "I fell into a coma back then and couldn't say goodbye to you. It's been my biggest regret. All these years...have you been well, Qin Dao You?"</p><p>"There have been ups and downs, but I've managed to get by," Qin Sang said with a carefree smile. "But you've given me a huge surprise. When I returned to the Cang Lang Sea, I learned from the Four Saints Palace that you were unable to leave in time during your ascension at the Seven Kill Hall, and were swept into the Void Chaos. Everyone was very worried about your safety.  Meeting you today, I find you not only safe and sound, but have also achieved far more than anyone could imagine. If Bao Zhengnan and his sister knew, they would be overjoyed…"</p><p>His biggest curiosity was how Su Nu had survived the 'ascension'.</p><p>According to the Jade Bone Devil Lord, even using the Ascension Platform and leveraging the Zi Wei Palace to break through the void and withstand the Void Chaos, one would need at least the late Yuan Ying stage to have a chance of survival.</p><p>There was no Ascension Platform on Yi Tian Peak, and Su Nu wasn't a Transcendence cultivator. She faced the Void Chaos directly. Logically, there was almost no chance of survival.</p><p>Could it be that, since the Seven Kill Hall brought Su Nu to this Greater World, her senior sister and Bai might also have been brought here instead of the Demon Realm?</p><p>"Qin Dao You is indeed from the Outer Regions," Su Nu said, "No wonder I couldn't find you when I searched the Cang Lang Sea. Do you remember the ancient Demon Lord under Yi Tian Peak?"</p><p>Su Nu's expression turned reminiscent as she recounted what happened.</p><p>"The ancient Demon Lord didn't die, and he's been trying to break the seal. During the ascension, the Seven Kill Hall was in turmoil, and numerous immortal restrictions were triggered. At the same time, countless ancient restrictions and formations were destroyed.</p><p>"The seal on Yi Tian Peak was inevitably affected. The Demon Lord sensed the changes outside and frantically attacked the seal. I couldn't escape in time.  Desperate, I could only try anything. I rushed towards Yi Tian Peak, hoping to use the Demon Lord's power to fight for a chance of survival.</p><p>"With attacks from both inside and outside, cracks soon appeared in the seal. The Demon Lord, eager to escape, used all his power.  The power leaking from the cracks in the seal did help me withstand much of the pressure.</p><p>"But it didn't last long. The Seven Kill Hall was torn apart by the Void Chaos, and countless ancient restrictions were destroyed. I struggled to hold on, but eventually fell into a coma.  I thought I was dead, but when I woke up, I found myself miraculously in the Greater World."</p><p>Hearing Su Nu's story, Qin Sang could only marvel at the unpredictability of life.  Su Nu's tragic experiences were all caused by the ancient Demon Lord, yet in the end, the Demon Lord became her protector.</p><p>Qin Sang asked about other details, and Su Nu thought hard, "During the ascension, I did see a palace in the distance, and a stone archway inscribed with the words 'Zi Wei Palace', but I was at my wit's end by then, and then I lost consciousness."</p><p>Learning that Su Nu hadn't seen her senior sister and Bai, Qin Sang felt somewhat disappointed, sighing inwardly. He then asked, "Did the Demon Lord break free?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Su Nu shook her head.  "When I woke up, I wasn't nearby. I was thrown somewhere else.  I was fortunate enough to become a disciple of a master and followed her for many years. Later, my master passed away, leaving me alone. I then heard that the Zi Wei Palace had appeared near Feng Ju Yu Men, and remembering that the Seven Kill Hall had many mysterious places—but lacked the strength to explore them at the time—I came here."</p><p>To have taught Su Nu, a cultivator at the Void Refinement stage, her master must have been extraordinary.  Seeing that Su Nu didn't intend to introduce her master, Qin Sang didn't press further.</p><p>The seal on Yi Tian Peak, weakened by years of erosion, was severely damaged during the ascension and certainly couldn't contain that demon.</p><p>What was the Demon Lord's cultivation level at his peak?</p><p>The thought gave Qin Sang a headache. He hadn't been very strong during the sealing, but had contributed significantly.  He wondered if the demon remembered him, and thus he might have gained another enemy.</p><p>However, if the ancient Demon Lord was also brought to this Greater World, with all the outside demons being hunted, he might not fare so well.</p><p>While Qin Sang was lost in thought, Su Nu had been gazing at his face, her eyes flickering.  Suddenly, she said, "Qin Dao You, may I call you Qin Xiong?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. "Of course."</p><p>"Qin Xiong, thank you."</p><p>Su Nu said her thanks solemnly, a relieved smile blooming on her face, radiant and beautiful.</p><p>"This is a thank you a thousand years overdue, but thankfully not too late."</p>
