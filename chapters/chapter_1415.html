<h1>Chapter 1407: Jing Hai Sect</h1><p>The decline was slow.</p><p>A scorching aura billowed, the sky ablaze with crimson. Any nearby islands would have been reduced to charcoal.</p><p>Even at night, the sea area was illuminated as bright as day by the light column.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others hadn't moved for days, periodically approaching the Buddha Lotus to assess the intensity of the fluctuations.</p><p>As night fell,</p><p>the light column's brightness was significantly dimmer than its peak.</p><p>The sea pit had also shrunk.</p><p>A streak of light shot out from the center of the sea pit.</p><p>Master Mu went down for another probe, then returned to the air, cautiously saying, "It's now within our tolerance.  In two or three hours, we should be able to enter."</p><p>Simply withstanding the impact of this fiery aura wasn't enough.</p><p>They needed the phenomenon to weaken further before they could handle other dangers.</p><p>They'd waited this long; a few more hours wouldn't matter.</p><p>A Qi cultivator breathed a sigh of relief.  "Finally! I never expected this to happen, being forced to wait these extra days, attracting so many people…"</p><p>The Qi cultivator glanced towards the distance.</p><p>Waves surged, gathering a large crowd of cultivators.</p><p>Figures stood on ships or hovered in mid-air, some Golden Core, some Foundation Establishment, even some reckless Qi Condensation cultivators joining the fray.</p><p>All were drawn by the spectacle in the Kong Ling Sea.</p><p>Several were even junior members of the Qi and Wang families.</p><p>Inquiries revealed the phenomenon was clearly visible hundreds of miles away.  Who knew how many more cultivators were on their way?</p><p>This was unexpected, but unstoppable.</p><p>"No matter who comes, we'll still have the advantage.  As long as we're fast enough, one or two people won't be a problem. It's just a shame some treasures might be taken,"</p><p>Master Mu said calmly.</p><p>Then, remembering something, he looked around, scanning the sea surface.  "Has True Person Chi Jie appeared yet?"</p><p>The Qi cultivator shook his head, coldly snorting, "No! Jiu Jie Island and the Kong Ling Sea aren't far apart. If that guy hasn't left Jiu Jie Island, he must know about this and wouldn't miss it! He's always been cunning, probably lurking somewhere, plotting. Everyone be careful inside."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's curiosity,</p><p>Master Mu explained, "Brother Qi's cultivation ground is not far from Jiu Jie Island.  There were some disagreements between their disciples, later escalating into a feud due to an accident…The phenomenon only appeared two days ago; other Nascent Souls, even if informed, would find it difficult to arrive so quickly. Chi Jie's strength is similar to Brother Qi's.  Facing the four of us alone, he shouldn't pose much of a threat. Of course, caution is always better."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>The vast, sparsely populated Unbounded Sea was chaotic, a mix of all kinds; even Nascent Soul cultivation grounds were far apart.</p><p>If they acted quickly, they had a chance to plunder the Jing Hai Sect before other Nascent Souls arrived.  But how dangerous was the Jing Hai Sect itself?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't optimistic, silently watching the Buddha Lotus, his gaze flickering.</p><p>As time passed,</p><p>the accumulated fiery aura continued to vent, its intensity gradually weakening. The Buddha Lotus, having endured the massive impact, was severely damaged.</p><p>It was barely recognizable, only fragments of Buddhist light remaining.</p><p>Yet, the clash between the two forces remained fierce.</p><p>Two hours passed.</p><p>After repeated probes, Master Mu and Qin Sang decided to storm the Jing Hai Sect!</p><p>The damaged Buddha Lotus presented no obstacle.</p><p>The four appeared before the Lotus, vaguely seeing a chaotic center of fiery aura, seemingly a doorway-shaped entrance, distorted by the impact.</p><p>Qin Sang saw it more clearly.</p><p>Behind the entrance, a powerful, intense fiery aura remained, with faint golden light flickering within, though its nature remained unclear.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Master Mu commanded.</p><p>He held the Serpent Spear, not pointing it at the entrance, but holding it across his chest.</p><p>'Hiss…'</p><p>A python's roar echoed, the spear twisting, suddenly erupting with profound light, transforming into a hundred-zhang-long black python.</p><p>The ethereal python coiled in the air, its head even extending out of the sea pit, overlooking the people on the surface.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and the others entering the sea pit, those who intended to get lucky and salvage something were instantly chilled by the python's cold gaze, their bodies stiffening.</p><p>Hei Mang’s dark snake darted back, shrinking rapidly until it coiled around Mu Guzhu, like a suit of scale armor. The snake spear proved to be a weapon equally adept at offense and defense.</p><p>Qi and Wang stood together.</p><p>The female cultivator Wang produced a tortoise shell-shaped artifact.  With a clap of her hands, the shell vanished, replaced by a shimmering tortoise shell phantom above their heads.  The inverted shell showered them with light, creating a protective aura—another defensive treasure.</p><p>The cultivator Qi stood ready with a spirit sword.</p><p>Qin Sang outwardly still wielded the Jin Chen sword, but the eighteen demonic banners were concealed within his sleeves.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Guzhu led the way, followed by Qi and Wang.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Sword energy and spear shadow struck simultaneously, targeting a weak point in the Buddha Lotus formation.</p><p>With a tremendous roar, a breach was blasted open in the light pillar, which then rapidly sealed itself.  Qin Sang and Mu Guzhu exchanged a glance, continuing their assault on the pillar.  The opening grew larger, wide enough to pass through, and they dashed inside.</p><p>Their judgment was precise, their execution flawless. The Buddha Lotus formation was unable to displace the intruders.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others reached the center of the light pillar, where they saw the entrance.</p><p>It was a passageway wide enough for a dozen people to walk abreast, originally resembling an ornate gate, now severely damaged. Only a single stroke of what was likely the character for “Purity” remained above.</p><p>Jing Hai Sect!</p><p>They’d found the right place!</p><p>A hint of elation flickered in Mu Guzhu’s eyes. After a brief observation, he plunged inside without hesitation.  Qin Sang, Qi, and Wang followed closely behind.</p><p>As the four figures disappeared, the light pillar returned to its original form.</p><p>The onlookers waited a considerable time before cautiously approaching the sea pit.</p><p>“Did the four masters really go in?” someone asked, utterly bewildered.</p><p>The energy fluctuations from the phenomenon were terrifying. Even Golden Core cultivators could barely maintain their footing at the edge of the pit; those of lower cultivation dared not approach.</p><p>A Golden Core cultivator beside him nodded repeatedly, envious.  “With such a powerful restriction, there must be incredible treasures inside.  What a stroke of luck, but not for us!”</p><p>“You think you can compete with Yuan Ying cultivators for treasure?” his companion rolled his eyes.  “If I can get a sip of the broth after the phenomenon subsides, I’ll be content.”</p><p>…</p><p>Unnoticed, two ethereal figures quietly approached the Buddha Lotus formation.</p>
