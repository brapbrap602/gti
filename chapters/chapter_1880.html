<h1>Chapter 1871: Uproar</h1><p>“Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!”</p><p>The White-robed Demon King’s maniacal laughter echoed across the altar as his dragon tail swept away the twenty-four fragments of the Heavenly Prison map and the demons.</p><p>The hearts of the righteous cultivators were filled with a mix of emotions, but they had no time to dwell on them. The storm unleashed by the dragon tail was relentlessly consuming one illusion after another.  They witnessed firsthand how the illusions they had just passed through were swallowed by the storm, their peaceful forms ripped apart, their fragments pulverized and drawn into the maelstrom, which then surged onward with even greater force, impacting other illusions. The storm was a harbinger of doom; one step behind, and annihilation was certain.</p><p>Above the altar,</p><p>golden light erupted from the large hole in the center of the auspicious clouds as the dragon tail finally withdrew from the altar.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The dragon tail vanished into the clouds like a startled bird, disappearing from sight.  Then, a brilliant golden light sped away into the distance.</p><p>The clouds churned, accompanied by wind and thunder.</p><p>From beginning to end, no one saw the true form of the great demon saint.</p><p>From the moment the dragon tail pierced the altar to the moment it carried away the map fragments, the entire process took only a blink of an eye.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bronze bell was blocked by the black wings, and the Star Jade Talisman was trapped within the thunder realm.</p><p>‘Ding-ling-ling…’</p><p>The bell tolled urgently.</p><p>Concentric sound waves erupted from the bell, forming dense, interconnected waves that resembled swirling yellow-brown energy rippling through the void, surging towards the black wings.</p><p>There were no tumultuous waves, only layer upon layer of sound waves.  They seemed to push gently, but as they expanded, an astonishing power steadily accumulated.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The sound waves repeatedly struck the black wings, but the wings remained unyielding, their downward pressure irresistible, like the collapse of the heavens.</p><p>The impact created a deafening roar – a direct confrontation between a Daoist master and a powerful beast in the Integration stage.</p><p>The feathers on the black wings were no longer smooth but disheveled, yellow light spreading across the feathers, gradually engulfing the wings and the beast's entire body, finally revealing the beast's full form.</p><p>A pair of wings spread across the vast expanse of the heavens, obscuring the sky, swooping down from above.</p><p>It was a beast resembling a hawk or falcon, its giant eyes like the sun and moon, radiating a terrifying aura.</p><p>However, no earthly hawk or falcon could possess such a colossal size. Anyone who witnessed this beast would be reminded of the Great Peng, capable of carrying mountains and obscuring the sky, as described in the Daoist scriptures.</p><p>The bronze bell, small enough to be dwarfed by a single feather of the beast, emitted yellow sound waves that enveloped the entire creature.  Its tiny mouth was aimed directly at the beast; the sound waves, like a net, sought to swallow the colossal beast whole.</p><p>On another battlefield,</p><p>the Star Jade Talisman was deeply embedded within the thunder realm.</p><p>Streams of gray lightning rained down relentlessly, striking the Star Jade Talisman, yet it seemed to strike empty space, even the thunder sounding muffled.</p><p>Looking towards the center of the thunder realm, the talisman had vanished, replaced by a mass of starlight.</p><p>The starlight wasn't condensed but dispersed; between the points of starlight lay a dark night sky.</p><p>This starry expanse was now expanding outward. Unlike the illusory starry sky that had appeared before, these stars were real; they merely existed on a single plane, forming a star chart.</p><p>The talisman transformed into a star chart.</p><p>As the star chart unfolded, gray heavenly thunder repeatedly struck it, shattering the stars, yet unable to destroy the chart itself, the thunder muted, as if striking the boundless void.</p><p>Finally, the star chart expanded beyond the limits of the thunder realm, continuing its expansion until the realm became part of the star sea.</p><p>Soon, the star chart surpassed the bronze bell, reducing it to an insignificant yellow star.</p><p>The stars within the star chart were now incomparably brighter than before, illuminating the sky, forming a genuine starry sky.</p><p>Darkness fell upon this world.</p><p>When the beast's wings had previously obscured the heavens, it also brought darkness, but people could distinguish it and were only consumed by fear.</p><p>In this moment, if the star chart ceased to change, people wouldn't doubt what they saw; they'd simply think night had fallen.</p><p>Beneath the starry sky, a figure condensed from starlight gradually emerged.</p><p>His body was ethereal, clothed in starlight, his appearance identical to the Daoist priest from the golden hall of the Zhongmao altar.</p><p>As the Daoist priest's phantom appeared, the star chart expanded at an accelerated rate, instantly engulfing the black-winged beast into the star sea.</p><p>The Daoist pointed at the void.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Stars shot out starlight, the starlights interweaving to form a celestial net, aiming to subdue both beasts with his own power.</p><p>‘Liiiit!’</p><p>Enraged, the beast let out a shrill cry, its wings vibrating as it violently struck the star chart.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Huang Tongling's bell gathered sound waves, vibrating slightly, transforming into a red light that pierced past the ferocious beasts and shot towards the Great Sage of the Yaozu.</p><p>At this time, the dragon's tail had already vanished into the clouds.</p><p>The dark clouds receded like a tide, the red light and golden glow chasing each other, disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>The Daoist's figure shifted slightly, as if about to step out of the star sea, but paused.</p><p>The two ferocious beasts would obviously not be trapped so easily, and the Daoist couldn't be certain whether they would pursue him after he left or charge towards the Daoist cultivators below.</p><p>If beasts of the Great Sage level were to break through the battle formations, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>Beyond the altar, smoke and dust billowed in the rear, forming a monstrous tide in the distance.</p><p>Deeper within the  Neiyuan, the Daoist sensed obscure auras, restless and agitated.</p><p>The Guifang Kingdom's use of the summoning drums here was undoubtedly a risky move.  A single misstep could result in heavy losses for the Daoist sect, leaving Guifang Kingdom unable to remain unaffected.</p><p>The Daoist gazed towards the horizon, his brows furrowed.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the altar, unprecedented chaos reigned.</p><p>Here, even Nascent Soul cultivators were like ants, streaks of escaping light flitting through endless illusions.</p><p>Some frantically fled, others acted against the flow, while still others watched, searching for refuge.</p><p>One bolt of lightning shot towards Qin Sang's cave dwelling.</p><p>After Left Zhenren's departure, Qin Sang immediately set off, not following Left Zhenren, but hurrying back to his cave dwelling with utmost speed.</p><p>“That was a Great Sage of the Yaozu…”</p><p>The image of the dragon's tail remained imprinted in his mind, lingering persistently.</p><p>Coupled with Left Zhenren's actions, the truth was self-evident.</p><p>“I still don't know the situation outside the altar. Since a Great Sage of the Yaozu made a personal attack, the Daoist True Monarch must have appeared as well… a single strike and then retreat. Could the Divine Court already have fallen to the Great Sage of the Yaozu?”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of unease.</p><p>He wasn't a member of the Daoist sect, yet relied on its power to establish himself in this world. If the Daoist sect were to fail and lose the Divine Court, wouldn't his path be at the mercy of demons and fiends?</p><p>Until now, Qin Sang hadn't imagined this battle to be so significant, involving so much.</p><p>Moreover, the battle's impact on him went beyond this.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head towards the depths of the altar.  If he guessed correctly, the dragon's tail targeted the place Left Zhenren had mentioned earlier, not far from the Crimson Gold Spirit Needle. The needle had probably been swept away by the storm.</p><p>It was impossible to predict what impact this battle would have on the interdimensional passage, potentially hindering the return plan.</p><p>However, these were matters for later. The urgent task at hand was the Flower Spirit in his cave dwelling.</p><p>Under no circumstances could the Flower Spirit be destroyed again.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The escaping light pierced the barrier, stopping above the flower field formation.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the flower field, seeing the Flower Spirit swaying. The dragon's tail had shaken the altar, and the vibrations had already reached here.</p><p>His expression was grave, his mind racing. He hesitated for a moment, not immediately moving the Flower Spirit, deciding to observe further.</p><p>A single strike from a Great Sage of the Yaozu shouldn't shake the entire altar, unless the Daoist True Monarch and the Great Sage of the Yaozu were to engage in further battle within the altar.</p><p>This cave dwelling might have a chance of survival.</p><p>Going outside now and being caught in the battlefield of the Unity Stage powerhouses might not be safer than here. The altar itself served as a barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered above the flower field, focusing on the depths of the altar, attentively sensing the fluctuations of the illusory storm, and occasionally looking up at the sky.</p><p>His mind remained taut, prepared at any moment to take the Flower Spirit away.</p><p>The storm raged more fiercely.</p><p>Illusions were constantly being swallowed by the storm, which continuously expanded outwards.</p><p>Qin Sang's location in the cave dwelling had not yet been affected by the storm, but the perceived fluctuations were growing stronger.</p><p>Soon, even areas untouched by the storm's main body were significantly affected. Illusions everywhere had their foundations shaken, displaying strange phenomena, mirroring the golden light bursts.</p><p>There was a rumbling sound beneath Qin Sang's feet, caused by the flower field formation shaking.</p><p>As time passed, the shaking became increasingly violent. Qin Sang entered the formation, his eyes flashing with brilliance, as if he were calculating something.</p><p>“It seems the storm's expansion rate is slowing down…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>Apparently, the balance maintained by the altar for so long wasn't that fragile. The ancient remaining divine powers had been stable for countless years, and could themselves resist the storm to a certain extent.</p><p>When a certain limit was reached, the storm would stop expanding. A turning point had appeared.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't sure where the storm's limit lay.</p><p>The impact on the formation continued to intensify. Even with Qin Sang's efforts to stabilize the formation, the flower field remained unsettled.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>A sudden thought struck Qin Sang.  He dashed into the eye of the flower field formation and discovered that the poisonous fruit within the eye was shaking violently.</p><p>The poison array hidden within the flower field was a later addition, cleverly integrated into the main formation.  When the main formation was attacked, the poisonous fruits were also affected.</p><p>If this continued, the remaining essence would likely be destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang had to divert some of her attention to protect the poisonous fruits while continuing to manage the main formation outside.</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>The expansion of the storm slowed noticeably.</p><p>However, the poison array could no longer hold. Qin Sang quickly returned to the hidden chamber, sighed, harvested the poisonous fruits, and stored them in a jade bottle.</p><p>The flower spirits needed a long time to recover after being transplanted, and this essence was crucial for him to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage; it couldn't be destroyed here.</p><p>With the removal of the poisonous fruits, the poison array immediately crumbled, and because of their interconnected energy, the flower field formation was weakened, creating a significant vulnerability.</p><p>Qin Sang struggled to maintain the formation, fending off wave after wave of attacks.  She watched in anguish as the flower spirits below swayed and wilted, some already showing signs of withering.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang protected her cave dwelling, the Daoist priests and others were desperately fleeing.</p><p>Along the way, they consumed countless precious talismans and treasures.</p><p>Finally, they encountered a fellow cultivator.</p><p>“Master Lei!”</p><p>The Purple-robed Daoist called out, his voice filled with relief.</p><p>Having just endured a fierce battle and protected so many junior cultivators, they were exhausted and relieved to find reinforcements.</p><p>After the South Heavenly Gate appeared, Daoist masters were rushing towards it. Even with the storm, these masters didn't abandon their fellow cultivators; instead, they chose to move against the storm.</p><p>The newcomer was a seemingly twenty-something, refined young man with a goatee, possessing an extraordinary bearing.</p><p>Seeing the Daoist priests, Master Lei visibly relaxed, and with a wave of his hand, cast over a dozen talismans.  The talisman light enveloped the group, greatly increasing their escape speed.</p><p>“Where are the others?”</p><p>After joining forces, the Purple-robed Daoist noticed he was alone and inquired.</p><p>“I haven't encountered any other fellow cultivators. As for the younger generation, they're waiting behind…”</p><p>Master Lei then joined the formation, sharing the burden with the four Grand Masters.</p><p>Gradually, more Grand Masters arrived to aid them, and finally, Master Zuo appeared.</p><p>With the combined efforts of the masters, the pressure lessened, and the storm’s expansion slowed.</p><p>Eventually, the masters stopped and looked back at their path.</p><p>From their position, they could see with their own eyes a dark, chaotic storm consuming everything, leaving no trace of any illusionary scene within.</p><p>Masters Zuo and the others already knew the truth.</p><p>Gazing at the storm, the masters fell into a long silence.</p><p>“The Divine Court’s reappearance…was it real?”</p><p>Master Lei was stunned, his voice a murmur, filled with frustration, “Was it… merely a lure by the Gui Fang nation?”</p><p>The masters remained silent.</p><p>What the Divine Court's return meant was clear to all. Hope, then dashed, was difficult for even them to accept.</p><p>Even if half the Divine Court had been taken by the demons, it would still have been better than this.</p><p>"Was the anomaly during the ritual a hundred years ago just a regular tremor?"  Master Ruochuan frowned, looking at the old Daoist.</p><p>Devising the plan wasn't hard; the difficulty lay in convincing the Daoist Court and the True Monarchs that the Divine Court had truly reappeared.</p><p>The Gui Fang nation's plot had been brewing for a long time – likely since the ritual anomaly.</p><p>If it was merely an ordinary tremor, no matter how realistic the Divine Court's decree was, it would be hard to convince the Daoist Court to risk everything.</p><p>The old Daoist remained silent.</p><p>No one could answer Master Ruochuan's question.</p><p>They could hear the frustration in her question. They too wished that the Jushan ritual held some unknown secret, rather than being a pure deception.</p><p>After a while, the Purple-robed Daoist sighed softly, “The twenty-four Prison fragments were lost in our possession. We don't know how to explain this to the Yintian Palace.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone cautiously looked at the old Daoist.</p><p>Perhaps out of guilt and unease, the old Daoist remained tight-lipped.</p><p>The Purple-robed Daoist said this to share the guilt of losing the artifacts.</p><p>Someone muttered, "For the Yintian Palace, it might not be a bad thing. The Gui Fang nation plotted for over a hundred years, with several demon kings self-reducing their cultivation. The Divine Court's reappearance was so realistic; it shows the demon saints' determination to obtain the twenty-four Prison fragments. Even if we hadn't brought them, there must have been a backup plan to lure away the two True Monarchs… If the demon saints personally attacked the Heming Mountain, it's likely that the loss would be far greater than just the fragments."</p><p>That being said…</p><p>The masters knew this was something they could only say amongst themselves, not to the Yintian Palace.</p><p>“The True Monarch will certainly compensate the Yintian Palace’s losses. I don’t know what the situation outside is, but we can't stay here long. Let's get out quickly; we can still kill some demons and make amends!”</p><p>Master Zuo responded.</p><p>The masters nodded in agreement, no longer lingering, and flew towards the outside of the ritual grounds.</p><p>(End)</p>
