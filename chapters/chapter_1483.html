Statement

Recently, an individual (QQ: 2xxxxx7355) has impersonated me, Yu Da Qingshi, the author of *Seeking the Path of Immortality*, and has been recklessly attacking others online, inciting disputes, causing significant harm to others, and also bringing negative repercussions to me.  
I hope this individual can recognize their mistake and cease such behavior.  
I reserve the right to pursue further action.  
My official author QQ account is 2261467554, which is solely used for managing reader groups, contacting editors, and handling commercial matters. To date, I have only joined the reader group for *Seeking the Path of Immortality* and have never made any remarks attacking others elsewhere.  
This statement is hereby issued.
