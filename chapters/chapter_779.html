<h1>Chapter 771: Ancient Cultivator's Legacy</h1><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, recalling the Nightfiend, then summoned his Ghost Banner, drawing upon Nine Nether Demonic Fire to envelop himself in a protective black shroud.</p><p>He took two steps forward, the fiery shroud flickering around him.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sensed the aura of the demonic flames. This aura was incredibly violent and terrifying, yet upon touching his fiery shield, it immediately softened.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire itself showed no signs of agitation.</p><p>The shield trembled, the external aura blocked.  Though it could easily break through, it didn't.</p><p>Despite its extraordinary origins, the demonic fire was ultimately inanimate.  Encountering the Primordial Fire, it displayed a sense of kinship. As long as it wasn't provoked, it wouldn't actively attack Qin Sang.</p><p>Even shielded, the impact on his Nascent Soul was unavoidable.  With the Jade Buddha's protection, this effect was negligible.</p><p>“It really works…”</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy as he returned the Fat Silkworm to its basket.</p><p>As he neared the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the purple mist dissipated.</p><p>No matter how powerful the purple mist was, it couldn't compare to the demonic flames and was firmly held at bay.  The Fat Silkworm, having maintained its poison-repelling shell for so long, could finally rest, immediately falling asleep upon returning to its basket.</p><p>Qin Sang, pressed close against the cliff face, cautiously inched forward.</p><p>The black demonic flames were right before his eyes.</p><p>Eyes wide, heart pounding, he held his breath, fearing any unexpected event.</p><p>If anyone were to disturb the Nine Nether Demonic Fire at this moment, causing even the slightest ripple, he wouldn't even have a chance to escape, instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p>The area occupied by the demonic flames wasn't large, but to Qin Sang, it felt incredibly vast.  His back was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang successfully passed through the fiery blockade. He let out a sigh of relief, taking deep breaths.  Casting a wary glance back at the flames, he then focused on observing the space before him.</p><p>Grayish-white ghostly mist drifted everywhere.  There was no wind, yet the air was bone-chillingly cold, the environment similar to the Immortal Graveyard.</p><p>Just how large was this space?</p><p>How many ghosts lurked within?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, choosing not to immediately leave the vicinity of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  If anything went wrong, he could quickly retreat.  Standing where he was, he released the Nightfiend to scout ahead.</p><p>Corpse Qi surged around the Nightfiend as it silently merged into the ghostly mist.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, using the soul imprint within the Nightfiend to guide it deeper into the mist.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the ancient teleportation formation, and their simultaneous appearance…</p><p>With so many coincidences, if anyone claimed there was no connection between the Seven Kills Sect and the Violet Citadel, Qin Sang wouldn't believe it.</p><p>If this place was similar to the Immortal Graveyard, it wouldn't be surprising.</p><p>The Nightfiend traveled a certain distance into the mist without encountering any tombs, gravestones, or anything similar.</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, “It seems this isn't an ancient burial ground! There are no immortal graves!”</p><p>His expression eased considerably.</p><p>The Immortal Graveyard of the Violet Citadel was a place feared by both Duke Dongyang and Chen Yan, a place where Ghost Kings with power comparable to Nascent Soul ancestors resided. If this place also contained immortal graves, Qin Sang would have hesitated.</p><p>Even stranger, after venturing in for so long, the Nightfiend hadn't encountered a single ghost.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted.</p><p>The Nightfiend also stopped, its head twisting, its eyes gleaming strangely as it stared at the ground to its left.</p><p>A piece of bronze, seemingly a corner of armor, protruded from the earth.</p><p>The bronze was heavily rusted, mostly buried underground, likely the remnants of an ancient cultivator's battle armor.</p><p>The Nightfiend glanced left and right, then walked towards the armor.</p><p>It extended a ghostly hand, gently touching the bronze.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the seemingly sturdy armor crumbled at the Nightfiend's touch, instantly turning to dust.  Eroded by countless years, it had completely decayed.</p><p>“The armor has decayed? Could there still be a lingering soul? If there's no lingering soul, how did this ghostly place form?”</p><p>Qin Sang whispered, a hint of melancholy in his eyes.</p><p>This armor was clearly no ordinary object. The person who once wore it must have been an incredibly powerful ancient cultivator. Now, the armor lay buried, its power gone, and the ancient cultivator had vanished without a trace, not even their remains left behind.</p><p>Even such a powerful ancient cultivator couldn't achieve immortality, perishing in this hidden valley, unknown to the world.</p><p>Could cultivators of this era truly attain the Dao and shine alongside the sun and moon?</p><p>The Nightfiend continued forward, encountering a broken sword, which similarly crumbled to dust at a touch.</p><p>Then, a skeleton came into view.</p><p>This skeleton, whether severed at the waist during life or damaged after death, only consisted of the upper body.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted. Finally, something unusual. He immediately ordered the Nightfiend to investigate.</p><p>The Nightfiend silently approached, its eyes scrutinizing the skeleton.</p><p>It paused briefly, then bent down to touch the bones.</p><p>At that moment, a pale white light flashed across the skeleton, followed by an ethereal figure screaming as it lunged at the Nightfiend.</p><p>Suddenly assaulted by the ghostly shriek, the Nightfiend merely blinked, its form flickering as it instantly retreated several meters.</p><p>The wraith, devoid of reason, relentlessly pursued, its cries filled with extreme hatred.  It was a vengeful spirit, intent on tearing the Nightfiend apart.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A ghostly hand appeared without warning, piercing directly into the wraith, stirring gently as corpse Qi surged.</p><p>The wraith froze, letting out a final shriek before being torn apart by the ghostly claw.</p><p>“It looks frightening, but its power isn't significant, likely comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  The Immortal Graveyard holds many deceased cultivators. The more cultivators who die, the more Nascent Souls devoured, the stronger the ghosts become, eventually giving rise to Ghost Kings. Since no cultivator has entered this place before, there likely aren't any extremely powerful ghosts…”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the wraith's power and made his analysis.</p><p>The Nightfiend flickered, returning to the skeleton.</p><p>Touching the bones again, no wraith emerged.</p><p>Emboldened, Qin Sang instructed the Nightfiend to accelerate its exploration.</p><p>The further it went, the more weapons and armor littered the ground – swords, spears, halberds, and all manner of implements.  None had survived the passage of time.  Even those seemingly intact crumbled to dust with a touch.</p><p>There were also more and more skeletons.</p><p>In some places, the bones piled high, forming massive heaps, a chilling sight, suggesting a past battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang had the Nightfiend test individual skeletons.  A small portion had wraiths attached, all of similar strength, none particularly powerful.</p><p>The Nightfiend even disturbed a small bone pile, releasing a dozen wraiths, all of comparable power.</p><p>All the wraiths had completely lost their sanity, driven only by endless resentment and killing intent.</p><p>“If all the ghosts here are similar to this wraith, it will be manageable. However, this isn't enough…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, ordering the Nightfiend to avoid the skeletons and proceed directly to the deepest part of the space, to see just how large it was and how many skeletons lay buried within.</p>
