<h1></h1><p>After leaving Chaos Demon Island, Tan Hao flew for a while and met Qin Sang, who had come to greet him. He finally breathed a sigh of relief and followed Qin Sang to an underwater reef.</p><p>Parting the water to enter, Tan Hao looked around, feeling something was amiss.</p><p>"I've set up a great formation here, but it's not yet complete; it's short on some spirit materials to refine formation artifacts," Qin Sang explained simply, taking the mustard seed pouch from Tan Hao. After opening it, he saw it was filled to the brim with spiritual objects.</p><p>Most of them were prepared for the Spirit Ascension Ritual.</p><p>He had bought three portions of each, almost exhausting Qin Sang's savings.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't decided yet whether to help the Fat Silkworm ascend in spirit, but it was never wrong to prepare in advance.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tan Hao hadn't managed to buy any of the three most important spiritual objects for the Spirit Ascension Ritual, nor could he inquire about them in Ten Thousand Demon City, showing how rare they were.</p><p>He could only wait for tomorrow's trading conference.</p><p>If he couldn't buy them, Qin Sang would have to go to Hundred Flowers Valley and trade for them with the Myriad Spirit Fruit.</p><p>Stowing away the mustard seed pouch, Qin Sang said, "I'll send you to Ebb Tide Island first. It's controlled by the Chamber of Commerce and is very safe. You wait for me there. If I don't return within three days, go back to the cave abode."</p><p>Tan Hao's heart skipped a beat. He looked at the formation Qin Sang had set up, his expression changing slightly. "Is it very dangerous?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "Just in case. It won't be a big deal."</p><p>Tan Hao gave a hum and silently followed Qin Sang, flying an unknown distance, and arrived at Ebb Tide Island.</p><p>After sending Tan Hao off, Qin Sang returned to the reef, took out the spiritual materials Tan Hao had bought, and piece by piece, formation artifacts took shape in his palm, completing the entire great formation.</p><p>The function of this formation was very singular, and its name was also very ordinary; it was simply called the Lost Trace Formation (or Maze Formation).</p><p>Unlike those common low-level Lost Trace Formations, this one was created by a senior of the Yuan Mirage Sect who was proficient in the Dao of formations, after comprehending ancient remnant formations.</p><p>This formation could trap a Nascent Soul cultivator, but it had no killing power. It required a considerable amount of time to set up in advance, and the formation artifacts could only be used once before they self-destructed.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose in setting up the formation was not to kill people. Once he found that the situation was not good, he would use the Lost Trace Formation to delay his opponent's footsteps so that he could escape.</p><p>This was Old Demon Chaos's lair, not suitable for entangling in battle.</p><p>Of course, if there was an opportunity to kill the enemy, he would not miss it.</p><p>Ever since he decided to bring the mysterious Ice Box to participate in the Ten Thousand Demon Assembly to probe the Profound Heaven Palace, Qin Sang had made double preparations, the Lost Trace Formation and Dan Ding Mountain, on the basis of improving his own strength, and should be able to ensure foolproofness.</p><p>As the last formation artifact was completed and put into the great formation.</p><p>A faint fluctuation silently emerged on the reef. Qin Sang flew up, looked down, and saw the reef flicker for a moment, then return to its original state.</p><p>He retracted his gaze, looked in the direction of Chaos Demon Island, returned to the reef and sat down, waiting for the trading conference to begin.</p><p>The next day, early in the morning.</p><p>Before dawn, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, took out his mask and put it on, and added a layer of barrier with his divine sense. He rode the escape light and flew towards Chaos Demon Island.</p><p>He encountered some cultivators along the way.</p><p>Those low-level cultivators sensed the aura released by Qin Sang and hurriedly avoided him.</p><p>Before long.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the outline of an island appear on the sea horizon. The area was indeed not small, and there were many mortals and cultivators on the island.</p><p>"Is Old Demon Chaos considered to be greatly hidden in the city?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Old Demon Chaos's Dao arena, restrained his aura, flashed this thought, suddenly felt something, his figure paused slightly, turned his head and looked west.</p><p>Before long, a black rainbow was speeding towards him from the horizon.</p><p>At this time, the person in the black rainbow discovered Qin Sang. The black rainbow stopped, revealing a figure wearing a white bone mask and wearing a wide black robe, a Nascent Soul Early Stage cultivator.</p><p>This person noticed Qin Sang's gaze and secretly became vigilant.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to him, indicating that he had no malice. In his heart, he sighed at the benefits of a powerful divine sense.</p><p>The two exchanged glances and were about to enter Chaos Demon Island.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang seemed to sense something again, his eyes suddenly changed, he suddenly raised his head, looked north of Chaos Demon Island, and at the same time, without saying a word, flashed into a jungle on the island.</p><p>The person wearing the white bone mask discovered Qin Sang's strangeness, his heart was stunned, and subconsciously followed his gaze to look north, the corner of his eye twitched violently.</p><p>A dark cloud floated in from the north at some point.</p><p>At this time, the sky was clear, the moon and stars were sparse, and this dark cloud seemed very abnormal. The dark cloud seemed slow but was actually fast, and its target was obviously Chaos Demon Island.</p><p>Seeing the dark cloud approaching, the Immortal Mountain in the northern part of Chaos Demon Island suddenly burst out with soaring strange light, illuminating half of the sky, and then a phantom slowly appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was actually Old Demon Chaos.</p><p>As soon as this figure appeared.</p><p>A sharp long laugh came from the dark cloud, and then the cloud gas rapidly converged, outlining a phantom of a Peng bird with cloud wings that covered the sky.</p><p>Above the cloud wings, there were actually several powerful figures standing, looking at Old Demon Chaos on the peak of the Immortal Mountain with different expressions, some fearful, some wary.</p><p>Demonic Qi soared into the sky!</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>The laughter stopped abruptly, and the Peng bird phantom shattered, revealing a man wearing a golden robe and an imperial crown in front of the demon kings.</p><p>The man's eyes were as sharp as arrows, and the tip of his nose was hooked. He stood with his hands behind his back in mid-air, and was majestic without anger.</p><p>His aura was not inferior to that of Old Demon Chaos. He said, "Old Demon, what do you mean by blocking this Great Sage's path? Could it be that you don't welcome this Great Sage to participate in the Ten Thousand Demon Assembly?"</p><p>"Great Sage Heavenly Peng has arrived in person, Chaos Demon Island is shining brightly, how can there be any reason not to welcome you? This old man is worried that his subordinates are ignorant and neglect the Great Sage, so he has to personally accompany you."</p><p>Old Demon Chaos's voice was flat, but his tone was quite dignified.</p><p>Great Sage Heavenly Peng chuckled, "It was agreed to be held in seven years, but it was suddenly advanced. Fortunately, this king has successfully cultivated this divine power, almost missing it."</p><p>Old Demon Chaos did not ask what divine power it was, and personally sent them into Ten Thousand Demon City.</p><p>In the forest.</p><p>Qin Sang restrained his aura and watched this scene from afar, thoughtfully saying, "This is the Great Sage Heavenly Peng in the late stage of transformation, indeed a demon king, worthy of his reputation, and a tricky character. I didn't expect that even he was alarmed by the Ten Thousand Demon Assembly. Hmm, Old Demon Chaos's energy is restrained by Great Sage Heavenly Peng, which is a good thing. The more chaotic the situation, the better."</p><p>While thinking, seeing Old Demon Chaos and Great Sage Heavenly Peng enter the city, Qin Sang walked out of the jungle with a normal expression and slowly flew towards Ten Thousand Demon City.</p><p>Entering the city, Qin Sang clearly felt that the atmosphere was not right.</p><p>A person's name, the shadow of a tree.</p><p>The appearance of Great Sage Heavenly Peng made the cultivators feel inexplicably depressed, even though there were more human race Nascent Souls in Ten Thousand Demon City, even though this was Old Demon Chaos's Dao arena.</p><p>The center of Ten Thousand Demon City.</p><p>There was actually a lake here. The address of the trading conference was the Lake Heart Island. At this time, a faint white mist was floating on the lake, isolating the line of sight.</p><p>At this time, many guards were guarding outside.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed repeatedly, heading straight for the lake shore. Immediately, a series of gazes shot over. Sensing the Nascent Soul aura emanating from him, the guards said nothing, stepped aside to make a path, and knelt down to salute in unison.</p><p>Then, the mist separated, revealing a light bridge leading directly to Lake Heart Island. A beautiful woman stood respectfully at the head of the bridge.</p>
