<h1>Chapter 860: The Kui Dragon</h1><p>“Fourth Junior Brother, is he the Junior Brother Xue you took as a disciple in Master's stead?”  Another black-robed figure looked over, appraising the shopkeeper from head to toe.  The gaze from beneath the hood was exceptionally sharp.</p><p>The shopkeeper looked a little uncomfortable. He hastily cupped his hands in greeting, bowing in a circle, and respectfully said, “Junior Brother Xue Ming greets Second Senior Brother and the other Senior Brothers.”</p><p>The Second Senior Brother grunted in acknowledgement, nodding slightly. “I trust Fourth Junior Brother’s judgment. Junior Brother Xue, as long as you work diligently, Master will not treat you unfairly.  Although we are not of the same race, with our Divine Rune paths exhausted, we too have been forced to cultivate your human cultivation methods, and even the Insect and Gu arts can only be used as supplementary techniques.  Aside from bloodline, there is no other difference between us.  A few pointers from Master can benefit you for life. By the way, this is a magical treasure Master asked me to give you.  Refine it when you return; it can be used for self-defense.”</p><p>As he spoke, the black-robed figure took out a long saber and handed it to Xue Ming.</p><p>Xue Ming was overjoyed. He received it with both hands and knelt facing south, “Disciple will never forget Master’s grace in bestowing this treasure.”</p><p>The Second Senior Brother chuckled and waved his hand. “There will be many more treasures bestowed by Master in the future. Go now, and do as your Fourth Senior Brother instructs…”</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue Ming, having received the treasure, left happily.</p><p>At this moment, the Fourth Junior Brother asked doubtfully, “Second Senior Brother, was that saber truly bestowed by Master?”</p><p>“I encountered an insolent human cultivator on the road and took it after killing him.”  The Second Senior Brother said nonchalantly, “The Xue Ming you recruited will be quite useful stationed in Tianxing City. Moreover, Master isn't like other members of our race who harbor deep-seated hatred for humans. Taking him as a personal disciple is quite possible. Consider the treasure a gift to one of our own.  We shouldn't delay any longer. Let's set off quickly.  We must set up the Beast King Banner in time, lest we jeopardize the important matter.”</p><p>The group set off, pursuing the direction Qin Sang and the others had left.  However, this was the heartland of human territory, so they were very cautious in their movements, avoiding contact with human cultivators.</p><p>At this point, another person asked, “Second Senior Brother, Fourth Senior Brother, First Senior Brother has been traveling with those human cultivators for so long, won't his identity be discovered?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Fourth Junior Brother asserted, “The ancient treasure Red Origin Gauze bestowed by Master can conceal our Witch Clan identities and allow us to disguise ourselves as human cultivators. Unless we encounter a Nascent Soul cultivator, there won't be any accidents. I've relied on this treasure to interact with human cultivators in Tianxing City and have never been exposed.  It’s a pity that this treasure is incomplete, and Master has no way to repair it. It will be destroyed after a few more uses.”</p><p>“That’s good. But I heard from First Senior Brother's message that this matter seems rather complicated. Since it's about finding a treasure for Master, why has it shifted to hunting a demon?  A late-stage Demon Core demon, with our combined efforts manipulating the Beast King Banner, we should be able to capture it, right? Why go through so much trouble?”</p><p>The Fourth Junior Brother’s tone was also somewhat puzzled. “First Senior Brother mentioned earlier that this demon beast seems to be a spirit beast raised by a cultivator. To obtain that treasure, we must start with these people.  And they are not easy opponents.  This trip should be to probe their strength. Master is absent, so we must act cautiously. That's precisely why First Senior Brother made such arrangements. When we arrive, we must not act rashly. We’ll wait for First Senior Brother’s signal.”</p><p>…</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others arrived in an unfamiliar sea region, still flying on their magical treasures.</p><p>Over the past few days, they had continuously practiced their formation, and now the five of them had completely mastered the Glacial Wind and Raging Fire Formation.  Their coordination was impeccable, allowing them to unleash the true power of the spirit formation.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang was very satisfied with this.</p><p>At this time, a small island appeared ahead.  After a slight turn, their flying light headed straight for the island.  Then, after circling briefly, they landed.</p><p>The group set foot on solid ground and flew to a higher vantage point, looking around.  They discovered that the island was not large, and the spiritual energy was exceptionally thin. There were no signs of demonic beast activity.  It didn't look like a place where a powerful demon would nest, which puzzled them greatly.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Fang, you’ve brought us to this desolate place, what demon are you planning to hunt?”</p><p>Unhurried, the young man surnamed Fang found a clean spot and sat down.  “Fellow Daoists, don’t be anxious.  The time is not yet right. We just need to wait.”</p><p>“Wait?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang nodded, pointing northeast. “The beast’s lair is over there, but it only emerges during stormy weather. The terrain of that island is unique.  Whenever there is heavy rain, there will surely be thunder and lightning.  It’s this thunder that attracts the beast. This place is at the edge of the Northern Sea. We won't have to wait long.”</p><p>“Thunderstorm…” Qiu Ji said suspiciously, “Could it be a Thunder Beast?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang smiled but didn't answer.</p><p>Seeing this, the others could only wait patiently, clearing out spaces nearby and quietly awaiting the arrival of the thunderstorm.  To be safe, they continued to practice their spirit formation, striving for perfection.</p><p>They waited for five days.</p><p>On the night of the sixth day, a violent wind suddenly arose, and dark clouds gathered rapidly in the sky, obscuring the stars in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Huge waves surged.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The salty sea breeze carried abundant moisture.  The rumbling of thunder came from afar, and silver light flickered and lightning snaked through the depths of the dark clouds.</p><p>Everyone abruptly stood up, exchanging glances, a mix of excitement and anticipation in their eyes.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Fang, can you tell us what kind of demon beast it is now?”  Ma Debo stroked his beard and asked, unable to contain his curiosity any longer.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang stared intently in the direction of the demon's lair, his eyes gleaming.  Then he turned and glanced at the dark and stormy weather behind them, retracting his gaze inconspicuously, and said calmly, “Since things have come to this, I won't hide it any longer. Our target is a Kui Dragon!”</p><p>“Kui Dragon!”</p><p>“It’s actually a Kui Dragon!”</p><p>Everyone exclaimed in surprise, never having expected such a demonic beast!</p><p>“No wonder it only appears during thunderstorms!  No wonder Fellow Daoist was so secretive!  It is said that the Kui Dragon is a divine beast that can control thunder and lightning.  With every breath, lightning flashes and fades. Magical treasures forged from its hide and bones can easily bestow the power to command thunder, transforming them into supremely yang and unyielding treasures, greatly increasing their power!  If news of a Kui Dragon’s appearance were to spread, even Nascent Soul Patriarchs wouldn’t be able to remain calm, would they?”</p><p>Qin Sang, being proficient in refining tools, had an encyclopedic knowledge of rare spiritual materials.  Treasures imbued with the power of thunder and lightning were incredibly rare, but using the hide and bones of a Kui Dragon could directly bestow this power.</p><p>The Kui Dragon was a treasure trove; no wonder the young man surnamed Fang was so cautious.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang chuckled.  “If it were a true Kui Dragon, it would indeed be as Fellow Daoist described. But the Kui Dragon is an ancient divine beast. How could it possibly exist in this era? This beast only possesses a portion of the Kui Dragon’s bloodline. It’s not that exaggerated. However, its ability to control thunder and lightning should not be underestimated.  At that time, I can only ask Fellow Daoists to activate the spirit formation to resist the lightning and suppress the beast.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. This made more sense. True descendants of ancient divine beasts were rare even in the Demon Sea.</p>
