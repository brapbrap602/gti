<h1>Chapter 1737:  Breaching the Gates</h1><p>The Yaohai Phoenix Clan's ancestral grounds were not located on an island.</p><p>In the northern reaches of the Yaohai, lay a verdant expanse, an ancient and majestic forest.  This area was far larger than any terrestrial jungle, yet its entirety was rooted underwater. White roots drifted in the sea like countless white serpents, the longest reaching into the unfathomable depths.  The underwater root system was a tangled, endless expanse, so interconnected that one might wonder if it all sprang from a single tree.</p><p>Countless magical birds inhabited this place.  Each sunrise, as the morning mist cleared, their chirping filled the air, and flocks of birds took flight, their colorful feathers shimmering in the sunlight, adorning the azure sky.</p><p>The Phoenix Clan resided at the heart of this forest.</p><p>One such morning...</p><p>A woman flew in from the sea, clad in colorful robes, with delicate features and a resolute expression.  Her serious demeanor and piercing gaze radiated an imposing aura, causing others to feel an overwhelming pressure in her presence.</p><p>Even the birds nesting at the forest's edge trembled at her approach, cowering in their nests, afraid to move.  Their fear stemmed not only from the imposing aura of a Yao King, but also from a unique bloodline.  It was the aura of a descendant of the Celestial Phoenix.</p><p>The Yaohai's queen!</p><p>Even the intelligent, non-Phoenix birds living there, upon seeing the woman from afar, initially intended to approach.  But one look at her eyes caused their hearts to tremble, and they dared not approach, offering their respects from a distance.</p><p>The woman's movement was incredibly swift, heading straight for the forest's center.  Nearing the Phoenix Clan's territory, she encountered a patrol of magical birds.  Their leader, though only at the Yaodan stage of cultivation, was a direct descendant of the Phoenix Clan, bestowed with Imperial Dew early in life, granting him sentience.</p><p>“Greetings, Ninth Phoenix King!”</p><p>The leader, along with his subordinates, prostrated themselves on the treetops, their heads bowed low. This was their customary greeting to those of higher rank.</p><p>The Ninth Phoenix King didn't even glance at them, continuing at the same speed, flying directly over them.  The bird leader didn't dare show any displeasure. The Ninth Phoenix King was their sovereign, second in rank within the Phoenix Clan, only to the Phoenix King.</p><p>The Yaohai's magical creatures did not use the title "Great Sage." Transformed Yao Kings were all addressed as Kings, but the titles Phoenix King and Phoenix Queen were unique and hereditary.  Male rulers were called Phoenix Kings, females, Phoenix Queens. In this generation, there was a Phoenix Queen but no Phoenix King.</p><p>The Ninth Phoenix King received her title early in her transformation, seemingly presumptuous, yet it was bestowed by the Phoenix Queen herself.  Being one of many siblings hatched from a single egg, she was the ninth, with eight older brothers. Yet, she surpassed them all in ability, earning the title of Ninth Phoenix King.</p><p>The Ninth Phoenix King had disappeared for a long time, prompting various speculations among the clan.  After the two domains were connected, the Ninth Phoenix King finally reappeared, achieving numerous feats of valor in battles against humans. Her reputation now rivaled even that of the Phoenix Queen in the entire Yaohai.</p><p>The Phoenix Queen rarely appeared, and all clans of the Phoenix tribe were under the Ninth Phoenix King's command. The Yao armies sent out were also under her leadership, highlighting her influential position.</p><p>The deeper she went, the more vibrant and lush the ancient trees became, possessing a beauty unmatched elsewhere.  Wherever the Ninth Phoenix King passed, the tribes prostrated themselves, her path unobstructed until she reached the Phoenix Clan's ancestral grounds.</p><p>Unlike her expectations, the ancestral grounds at the forest's center were surprisingly a hollow, revealing the open sea, resembling a lake on land.  Scattered across the surface were small tree islands, some important Phoenix Clan sites, others the caves of Phoenix Yao Kings, exuding powerful auras.</p><p>The ancestral grounds were heavily guarded, protected by magical formations.  Even with the Ninth Phoenix King's status, she couldn't simply force her way in.</p><p>The ancestral grounds' guards had already been informed. Two teams of Yao guards, radiating potent energy, and all elite Phoenix warriors, flew in from either side.  Unlike those encountered earlier, they weren’t intimidated by the Ninth Phoenix King's presence. If she disobeyed clan rules, they would dare to act.</p><p>The Ninth Phoenix King produced a slender, colorful feather and swiped it through the air, creating an unseen connection.</p><p>The guards' expressions softened as they prostrated themselves: “Greetings, Ninth Phoenix King.”</p><p>Simultaneously, a black streak of light shot from the depths of the ancestral grounds, landing before the Ninth Phoenix King, revealing a handsome man with black wings sprouting from his ribs.</p><p>“Ninth Phoenix, you weren't on Luo Ying Island. Why have you returned to the ancestral grounds?”</p><p>His tone wasn’t accusatory, but rather affectionate, his eyes full of admiration.</p><p>“Human activity.”</p><p>The Ninth Phoenix King didn't give him much attention, her response concise. She then attempted to bypass him.</p><p>The man politely stepped aside, but followed behind her, “The clan received reports, aware of the situation on Da Huang Island.  In previous years, you personally oversaw and monitored human movements.”</p><p>“I’ve traveled far to return to our ancestral lands.  Has something terrible happened?”</p><p>King Nine-Phoenix seemed impatient, his expression darkening. His speed suddenly increased. “I must see the Phoenix King immediately. If you wish to know, ask her yourself.”</p><p>The man, rebuffed, dared not press further. Watching King Nine-Phoenix’s back, a look of sorrow flashed in his eyes.</p><p>The Phoenix ancestral lands weren’t vast.</p><p>Flying past numerous wooded islands, King Nine-Phoenix soon saw a true spirit island.</p><p>A thin mist shrouded the island, filled with abundant spiritual energy.  Luxurious palaces were visible amidst the exotic flowers and plants.</p><p>As King Nine-Phoenix approached, before even landing, a powerful pressure descended upon them.</p><p>King Nine-Phoenix hovered in mid-air, unable to move.</p><p>A moment later, a voice, full of authority, echoed from the island’s center, “Nine-Phoenix, you returned without notice. What brings you here?”</p><p>King Nine-Phoenix bowed slightly. “The situation has changed. I dared not act on my own. I ask the Phoenix King for guidance.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The mist parted slowly to the sides, revealing a woman in a multicolored gown and phoenix crown. She was squatting by a flowerbed, seemingly admiring the vibrant blooms.</p><p>The woman stood and looked over.  Her beauty was breathtaking, eclipsing even King Nine-Phoenix.</p><p>“Have the humans taken Luo Ying Island?”</p><p>The Phoenix King’s gaze was steady, her tone even.</p><p>At this question, King Nine-Phoenix shuddered.</p><p>The Phoenix King sighed softly, “Do you know why I allowed you to enter?”</p><p>This was clearly not directed at King Nine-Phoenix; her gaze shifted behind him.</p><p>She walked gracefully, her colorful gown swaying.  “The humans captured Luo Ying Island, sealing it off, believing the news wouldn’t leak. But our clan has its own methods of perception.  I didn’t expect that Nine-Phoenix, with your abilities, would fall into their hands, let alone be enslaved and lead the enemy here to assassinate me.  It seems you’ve mastered some incredible new power…”</p><p>As the Phoenix King approached, her voice grew harsher.</p><p>Simultaneously, the surrounding mist fluctuated, revealing numerous figures.  Powerful auras emanated from them—clearly, they were all demon kings, encircling King Nine-Phoenix.</p><p>The demon kings, who should have been in secluded cultivation, had been summoned back to the island by the Phoenix King, lying in wait.</p><p>This was a clear trap!</p><p>King Nine-Phoenix's arrival was sudden. Few demon kings remained guarding the ancestral lands, but those present, along with the Phoenix King, were enough to subdue any intruder!</p><p>King Nine-Phoenix seemed to regain her senses.</p><p>With each word from the Phoenix King, despair and shame deepened on her face, yet an invisible force held her in place, immobile.</p><p>Her eyes bloodshot, she struggled to speak, but couldn’t. Finally, overcome with grief, she vomited blood, the light in her eyes fading rapidly.</p><p>“A fierce one, at least.”</p><p>A voice suddenly came from behind.  A figure slowly materialized—a Daoist priest.</p><p>With his appearance, Nine-Phoenix’s body collapsed, transforming back into a  small, feathered bird in mid-air before falling into the sea, eliciting cries of sorrow.</p><p>The large body’s splash was enormous,  the bird already lifeless.</p><p>The Phoenix King stared intently at the seemingly appearing Daoist, killing intent surging from her eyes, yet mingled with surprise and doubt.  “Who are you?”</p><p>The Daoist was Qin Sang’s external avatar, of course, unknown to the Phoenix King.</p><p>The other demon kings were incredibly surprised. This person showed no fear before the Phoenix King, a powerful, unfamiliar cultivator.  When did the human race acquire such a powerful individual, willing to risk their life alone to infiltrate the Phoenix ancestral lands to assassinate the Phoenix King?</p><p>The avatar remained silent.  A dark glow flickered in his right palm, revealing a tattered banner.  With a flick of his wrist, demonic energy soared, coalescing beside the avatar into a humanoid form.</p><p>This was Su Zi Nan, transformed into a demon soul.</p><p>Su Zi Nan’s expression was emotionless. A black ruler hovered before him, his eyes icy and merciless; anyone meeting his gaze would feel a chill in their heart.</p><p>After refining the Three Corpse Death God Banner, the avatar had yet to encounter a worthy opponent to unleash his full power.</p><p>With the demon soul’s appearance, the Phoenix King’s pupils constricted, causing an uproar behind her.  This person was not only a powerful cultivator but also controlled a demon soul almost as strong as his physical body. Fortunately, he hadn't succeeded; otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The avatar pointed forward.</p><p>Murderous intent filled the demon soul’s eyes. The black ruler instantly multiplied into thousands of shadowy images, momentarily obscuring the sunlight, casting the surrounding sea in darkness.  The shadowy images suddenly converged, striking with immense force towards the Phoenix King's forehead.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The Phoenix King roared.</p><p>This expert must not be allowed to escape!</p><p>Her colorful dress erupted with divine light.  The three exquisitely painted phoenixes on the dress came to life, circling and soaring into the sky, just as the black scepter was about to take shape.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The dark light and multicolored radiance merged into a single mass, making it impossible to distinguish between the scepter and the phoenixes.</p><p>Simultaneously, a strange transformation occurred beneath the avatar. A crimson vortex appeared out of thin air, emanating an immense suction force, like a gaping maw.</p><p>The vortex contained not only suction, but also an unknown, chaotic energy.</p><p>However, the avatar seemed prepared.  A green light flickered on its chest, and a piece of wood armor, resembling tree bark, materialized.  The armor flashed to the top of the vortex, emitting a steady stream of green light, imbued with immense power.</p><p>The wood armor seemed to become embedded in the vortex, neither rising nor falling, rendering the crimson vortex helpless against it.</p><p>But, since the Phoenix Clan was prepared, they couldn't have only this one method.</p><p>As the spirit attacked, mist dispersed, revealing numerous demon king figures who surrounded them.  Most shared similar bloodline auras and used identical abilities.</p><p>Behind each demon king, a phantom demonic body appeared, varying slightly in form but all bearing the hallmarks of Phoenix bloodline.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang's true form's dharma image, these were manifestations of their abilities.  The phantom bodies shattered instantly, transforming into strange beams of light—green, red, and other colors—corresponding to their different clans.</p><p>The man who had glared at the avatar with hatred fired a black beam of light.</p><p>All the light beams targeted the avatar.</p><p>Suddenly attacked, the avatar remained calm.  Just as it was about to retaliate, it sensed something amiss.  It discovered, to its surprise, that the beams of light dissipated a hundred meters from its body, as if they didn't exist.</p><p>The next moment, the avatar felt a dizzying sensation.  The surroundings changed drastically, and it found itself sealed within a multicolored barrier.</p><p>It could still see the demon kings, with streams of light swirling between them, seemingly pushing them further away.</p><p>The avatar looked around.  It remained in place, yet it felt that even if it tried to pursue the enemy, it would likely exhaust itself before catching up.</p><p>This was of course an illusion, but a cultivator of lower level would indeed exhaust themselves to death.</p><p>Streams of light flowed like a tide, everywhere.</p><p>The avatar looked up, seeing what appeared to be a multi-colored sun in the sky, with more light continuously converging towards it.</p><p>Sensing the threat, it knew it couldn't allow the sun to fully form.  With a flick of its sleeve, it shot out a cold light, finally unleashing the four-tiered  serpent seal!</p><p>The blue cold light formed an aura of brilliant light, dense as a sheet of icy flames.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Two colossal beings appeared within the icy flames, playfully chasing each other.</p><p>Upon seeing this, the confident demon kings’ expressions changed. Someone exclaimed, "A spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Before the words left their mouths, the two serpents raised their heads, fixated on the multicolored sun.  Riding the icy flames, they roared and charged towards the sky. Simultaneously, the spirit also launched the black scepter at the multicolored sun.</p><p>At this moment, an outsider observing the battlefield would have seen the avatar and spirit surrounded by demon kings, with no apparent abnormalities, leading one to assume that they were simply facing off.</p><p>Then came a thunderous roar.</p><p>Waves crashed over the Phoenix Clan's ancestral land.</p><p>The void around the avatar suddenly shattered like a mirror.  The colorful beams of light reappeared, but now chaotic and disordered. The two majestic serpents burst forth, spewing forth a torrent of icy flames.</p><p>The demon kings were shocked and unprepared.</p><p>The Phoenix King, who was chanting an incantation, hadn't expected her ability to be broken so quickly. Her face shifted through various expressions. With a cold snort, she lightly tapped her hand, and a phoenix claw suddenly appeared above the two serpents, seeming to strike from thin air, ghostly and unpredictable.</p><p>With the appearance of the claw, the chaotic streams of light found their focus, stabilizing and converging towards the claw, transforming into a giant claw that swiped at the serpents.</p><p>This was equivalent to the Phoenix King and all the demon kings attacking together.</p><p>The serpents roared, spewing icy flames.  The two streams merged in mid-air, joining forces with the spirit, striking the giant claw directly.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A dazzling array of light and color erupted.</p><p>Just as the Phoenix King was about to strike again, she seemed to sense something and her expression drastically changed.  She cried out in alarm, and retreated from the battlefield, instantly appearing above the spirit island.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>In front of an ancient hall on the spirit island.</p><p>Qin Sang's true form, somehow, had appeared here.  Gazing at the hall sealed by a five-colored light barrier, he pressed his palm against it, his eyes glowing strangely.</p><p>In his perception, the barrier was extraordinary, with a familiar energy flowing through it, likely originating from the broken feather.</p><p>The Phoenix King arrived in alarm.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, smiled slightly, and lightly tapped his finger. The Seven Mansions Star Division Sword Array materialized in the starry sky, enveloping a vast expanse of heaven and the Phoenix King, isolating her from the seal within the hall.</p><p>Then, he raised his palm, revealing a spirit tree.</p><p>Six firebirds shook their wings and flew from the tree, charging toward the hall!</p><p>(End)</p>
