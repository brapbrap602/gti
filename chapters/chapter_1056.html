<h1>Chapter 1448: Hidden Valley</h1><p>Chapter 1448: Hidden Valley</p><p>After a moment, the High Priestess manipulated the divine runes, reaching towards the stone pillar.  The pillar glowed, runes pulsed, and a strange spectacle appeared, only to vanish immediately.</p><p>Undeterred, the High Priestess tried again and again, each attempt making the pillar's glow last longer.</p><p>Hope grew among the onlookers.</p><p>Elder Fang remained quietly by the side, not disturbing the High Priestess.</p><p>She would try, then pause for reflection.</p><p>After a considerable time, the High Priestess seemed to understand something, a look of enlightenment crossing her face.  Quickly forming hand seals, she sent wave after wave of incantations into the eight stone pillars.</p><p>In an instant, the pillars blazed with light.</p><p>The entire stone chamber was illuminated, bright as day.</p><p>Strange energy emanated from the eight pillars, converging towards the center of the formation, but it faded quickly, threatening to dissipate.</p><p>The High Priestess paused, then made a soft sound of surprise.  Changing her hand seals, she activated more divine runes, pushing the array to its limits.</p><p>Finally, the formation stabilized, and the energy in the center of the pillars became more pronounced.</p><p>The others sensed something, their expressions shifting.</p><p>"It's…"</p><p>Before they could finish, the formation fully activated, and a gentle, moonlit array appeared on the stone platform, radiating a soft light.</p><p>Even the High Priestess was stunned by the complete formation.</p><p>The group exchanged bewildered glances.</p><p>An elder gasped, "A teleportation array! It has to be! How can there be a teleportation array here? And where does it lead?"</p><p>The High Priestess had activated a teleportation array!</p><p>On Witch God Mountain, there was a teleportation array leading to the Demon Sea. Though vastly different in appearance, both arrays shared a unique energetic signature.</p><p>No one expected to find an ancient Wu clan teleportation array here.</p><p>External restrictions and two layers of sealing arrays protected it – solely to seal this teleportation array?</p><p>The strangeness of it all left them baffled.</p><p>"Those seals were likely to conceal the array's existence," the High Priestess mused. "We can't know now whether the Wu and human clans were allies or enemies in ancient times. This place is deep within human territory; our ancestors might have taken such precautions to prevent the humans from discovering it…"</p><p>The others nodded; the High Priestess's theory was plausible.</p><p>Countless years had passed, making it impossible to uncover the truth.</p><p>Where did this array lead?</p><p>Could it connect to another cultivation world, similar to the Demon Sea?</p><p>At this thought, several elders became excited. A new cultivation world meant greater hope – perhaps the chance for ascension, the possibility of finding another branch of the Wu clan, or at least, more resources.</p><p>Elder Fang saw through their hopes. He sneered, "Don't get ahead of yourselves. The array is in the Seven Kills Hall. With our strength, we can't wrest it from human control. Even if we find a new cultivation world, we could only travel there secretly once every few decades. Besides, I suspect this array doesn't transmit very far…"</p><p>The question remained: what was on the other side, and was it dangerous?</p><p>Elder Fang remained motionless, seemingly unconcerned.</p><p>Traveling there, facing unknown dangers, might mean no return. He would absolutely not risk it for others.</p><p>Then, an elder stepped forward, patting his spirit beast pouch and summoning a Core Formation spirit beast.</p><p>"We'll find out if there's danger on the other side."</p><p>The elder then ordered the beast to enter the array.</p><p>The High Priestess placed several mid-grade spirit stones and activated the array.</p><p>In a flash of light, the spirit beast vanished.</p><p>Everyone looked at the spirit stones; very little spiritual energy had been consumed.</p><p>"The transmission distance is very short, likely within the Seven Kills Hall's range, perhaps to some hidden realm,"</p><p>the High Priestess deduced.</p><p>Before she finished, the elder's face turned pale, and he groaned.</p><p>To everyone's astonishment, he swallowed a pill, his complexion slowly returning to normal.  He sighed, "The spirit beast is dead!"</p><p>Everyone was shocked. "It died the instant it arrived?"</p><p>The elder nodded gravely.</p><p>The others were stunned.</p><p>This elder was skilled in beast taming, and his spirit beasts were exceptionally strong.  A Core Formation beast, adept at escape, hadn't even lasted a moment.</p><p>The group fell silent.</p><p>Despite the risks, they had to investigate their ancestors' legacy.</p><p>But who would scout the way?</p><p>"Grand Shaman, in a few years I will face a great tribulation. I believe I have little chance of survival, so dying here is not a pity.  Before I die, I can do something for my clan, and that will be a worthy death. I have no disciples. If I don't return, I have several descendants, I hope the Grand Shaman can take care of them."</p><p>An old man stepped forward and said solemnly.</p><p>The Grand Shaman said gravely, "Master Wan, rest assured. I will take them to Wushan for seclusion."</p><p>The old man surnamed Wan nodded, stepped forward, and activated the teleportation array.</p><p>Everyone began to wait anxiously.</p><p>After a while, the teleportation array suddenly lit up. Everyone was overjoyed, but upon seeing Master Wan's condition, they were all greatly surprised.</p><p>Master Wan's face was inexplicably black, emitting a faint dark aura, his breath weak.</p><p>A cultivator in gray robes noticed something, immediately rushed over, checked briefly, and quickly produced a bottle of elixir, giving it to him.</p><p>"Master Wan has been poisoned!"</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator said softly.</p><p>Master Wan nodded his thanks to the gray-robed cultivator, sat cross-legged, refined the elixir's power, and slowly expelled the poison from his body, his complexion gradually improving.</p><p>"No wonder that spirit beast died upon arrival," Master Wan chuckled bitterly, "The other side is a highly toxic wasteland, filled with colorless and odorless poison. I was caught unaware. I felt something was wrong, took the antidote I carried, but it had little effect on this potent poison. I had to return for help without a thorough inspection. From what I observed, apart from the poison, there should be no other dangers. However, fellow cultivators, please do not underestimate this; if poisoned too deeply, even Yuan Ying stage cultivators could perish here!"</p><p>After hearing this, the Grand Shaman and Old Master Fang exchanged glances.</p><p>Old Master Fang chuckled, "If I'm not mistaken, that's the Shadow Valley. Unexpectedly, this teleportation array connects to the Inner Sanctuary. The Inner Sanctuary has always been occupied by humans; now we can also have a share."</p><p>The Grand Shaman hummed, "Among the Seven Killing Hall's three major poisonous lands, the Purple Mist Wasteland with its pervasive purple mist, and the Flower Fairy Lake with its poisonous algae, are all in the Outer Sanctuary. Unless you are in the very core, these two poisonous places cannot have such potent poison. Yuan Ying stage cultivators poisoned will immediately suffer from the poison, making it difficult to resist. Only the Shadow Valley in the Inner Sanctuary, it is said to be filled with colorless and odorless poison, extremely difficult to guard against."</p>
