<h1></h1><p>“You dare!”</p><p>Yu Gu returned to the Blood Altar, the scene before him driving him into a furious rage.</p><p>Above the Blood Altar, the sky was gloomy. The void seemed to be torn apart by an immense force, filled with visible spatial turbulence. A mysterious diagram, woven from cyan light, slowly rotated. The Blood Altar itself was affected, chaotic power forming a tempest with the diagram at its heart.</p><p>Old Devil Ye floated beneath the diagram. Even with his formidable cultivation, he seemed unsteady against the tempest’s onslaught. Strange light flickered around him as he channeled a protective secret art to maintain his footing within the storm.</p><p>At this moment, another figure appeared opposite Old Devil Ye, precisely where Yu Gu had just been.</p><p>It was Bai!</p><p>This time, he was no longer a hidden observer but had revealed himself in broad daylight!</p><p>Bai floated in mid-air, seemingly oblivious to Old Devil Ye, preoccupied with his own actions. His fingers danced like butterflies, weaving incredibly complex and unprecedented hand seals. These seals flew from his hands like flowing water, merging with the Blood Altar.</p><p>As he continued, strange phenomena manifested around the altar. The most striking was the diagram. Its cyan light intensified, illuminating the surroundings with stark clarity. Ghostly mists and spectral souls were tinged with cyan as the diagram spun rapidly, its runes becoming increasingly distinct and complete.</p><p>Grand and mysterious! A vast, ancient aura emanated from the diagram, soaring towards the heavens.</p><p>Bai tilted his head slightly, gazing at the diagram, the surprise in his eyes deepening.</p><p>Old Devil Ye stood motionless, making no move to interfere, silently watching Bai’s actions.</p><p>Seeing the transformation of the diagram, a strange glint flashed in Old Devil Ye’s eyes, filled with profound astonishment. He scrutinized the mysterious figure who had suddenly appeared. He never imagined that, in this era, besides that lingering demonic fiend, someone else understood how to activate the restrictions on the altar.</p><p>Bai made no attempt to conceal his aura. Old Devil Ye easily discerned that Bai possessed a Corpse King physique. Bai’s cultivation should be inferior to his own, but for some reason, Old Devil Ye sensed a faint threat from Bai, arousing a hint of apprehension within him.</p><p>He racked his brains but couldn't recall such a figure ever appearing in the Northern Chen Realm.  There were many Corpse Dao cultivators in the Northern Chen Realm, but few had broken through to the Nascent Soul realm, as the righteous path had held the upper hand in the major regions.  Old Devil Ye had interacted with most of them, yet he couldn't connect any with the person before him.</p><p>“How did a Corpse King appear out of nowhere? Could it be another ancient being?  Just how many similar existences are there in the cultivation world, hidden in seclusion, waiting for the right moment?”</p><p>For the first time, Old Devil Ye felt that the Northern Chen Realm still harbored many secrets, secrets even he was unaware of.  Yu Gu was using this to force his hand. If Bai could activate the altar, it might not be a bad thing. Old Devil Ye pondered and remained passive, allowing Bai to continue, observing the unfolding situation.</p><p>However, Old Devil Ye’s peripheral vision remained locked onto the direction Yu Gu had departed.</p><p>As expected, as soon as Bai began, Yu Gu sensed it.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Yu Gu roared in fury, lunging towards the altar.</p><p>Bai calmly withdrew his gaze from the diagram, glancing at Yu Gu, then turned to Old Devil Ye, saying meaningfully, “I urge fellow daoist to reconsider!”</p><p>These words were clearly a reminder to Old Devil Ye, urging him to grasp the situation.</p><p>Old Devil Ye sneered.  However, to his surprise, Old Devil Ye didn't intervene, clasping his hands, adopting a neutral stance.</p><p>Bai, having warned Old Devil Ye, shifted his gaze, coldly fixing it on Yu Gu.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Yu Gu's entire body was enveloped in violet light, like a cocoon. Within the violet light, Yu Gu's true form was obscured, but his increasingly tyrannical aura could be felt, an astonishing pressure erupting from the cocoon.</p><p>In an instant, Yu Gu closed in, a giant violet palm slamming down towards Bai.</p><p>Bai stood motionless, seemingly stunned, making no move to defend himself.</p><p>Old Devil Ye frowned slightly, wondering if his judgment was wrong. Even if Bai was concealing his strength, he shouldn’t be so arrogant against Yu Gu. Otherwise, why would he be so wary of Yu Gu?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Yu Gu was within striking distance.</p><p>Suddenly, an ethereal starlight burst forth beneath the altar. Initially faint, it instantly erupted into a massive beam of light, soaring skyward.  Yu Gu, flying directly into its path, was swallowed by the pillar of light.</p><p>Within the light beam, specks of starlight shimmered.  It resembled a miniature starry sky. These shimmering points were Star Essence Stones.</p><p>And at the base of the light beam, amidst the Star Essence Stones, a slender figure materialized, revealing the long-absent Qing Jun!</p><p>Qing Jun’s eyes were downcast, her jade-like fingers manipulating threads of light, arranging the stars. The Star Essence Stones became pieces in her hands, moving back and forth like true stars, seemingly chaotic, yet following a unique pattern.  These were the same Star Essence Stones Qin Sang had retrieved from Finger Sky Peak.</p><p>The Yuan Mirage Sect had collected numerous ancient formations, some of which required Star Essence Stones for deployment.  This spirit formation was one of them. It could be said that Qing Zhu's tragedy stemmed from these very stones.</p><p>Having occupied the Yuan Mirage Sect, Qing Jun had perused the ancient texts and comprehended this spirit formation. When Bai flew to the altar and activated the diagram, she had concealed herself, secretly laying down the spirit formation, waiting for Yu Gu’s return.  Enraged by Bai, Yu Gu had been careless and fallen into the trap!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The starlight trembled. Within the pillar of light, beams of starlight crisscrossed, forming a cage, trapping Yu Gu within.  This formation possessed a binding effect!</p><p>Unfortunately, Qing Jun’s opponent was too powerful. Trapped within the spirit formation, Yu Gu launched a frantic counterattack. The intense violet light threatened to overwhelm the starlight, causing it to dissipate. The cage was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The Star Essence Stones shattered one after another under the impact.  Yu Gu’s demonic flames raged.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Qing Jun’s calm gaze. She hadn’t anticipated Yu Gu’s strength. His experience was also vast, constantly targeting the weak points of the formation, leaving her no time to reinforce them.</p><p>At this rate, it wouldn’t take long for Yu Gu to break free.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A swathe of starlight extinguished. The violet energy surged even more fiercely.</p><p>Qing Jun, needing to maintain the formation from within, wouldn't have time to escape.</p><p>At this critical juncture, a chain shot through the air, flashing into the spirit formation, weaving through the violet energy like a serpent.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang arrived immediately afterward, his breath ragged.</p><p>Even at full speed, he had nearly missed the timing, but he had made it just in time.  He didn’t dare hesitate.  With a hand seal, the diagram corresponding to the Demon Binding Rope appeared above his head.  With a flick of his finger, it floated above Yu Gu.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The violet light dispersed, revealing Yu Gu's true form.</p><p>Around him, chains coiled – the Demon Binding Rope!  The Demon Binding Rope constricted, unleashing countless tiny black lightning bolts from its iron links, piercing towards Yu Gu like needles. </p>
