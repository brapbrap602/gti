<h1>Chapter 1442 Shi Xue and Liu Li</h1><p>Lake Heart Island.</p><p>In a bamboo building.</p><p>Puppet maidservants stood guard silently outside the door.</p><p>Inside the room, two women sat on bamboo chairs.</p><p>One woman wore a silver half-mask, her hair elegantly styled. The mask revealed a high, straight nose and lips like glazed porcelain, curving into a subtle smile.</p><p>She wore a vibrant green silk dress, her figure slender and graceful. Leaning slightly against the bamboo chair, she exuded a languid air.</p><p>Her hands rested casually on the armrests, her wrists delicate and white, the icy crystal bracelet on her wrist sparkling brilliantly.</p><p>Her almond-shaped eyes held a hint of curiosity as she gazed at the darkness outside the room.  She then tapped her chin thoughtfully, seemingly eager to break the barrier and see what lay beyond, curious about the machinations of the Demon Assembly.</p><p>Opposite her sat a woman dressed in pristine white.</p><p>This woman wore a veil, her legs together, sitting upright on the bamboo chair, radiating a cold aura, like a statue of ice.</p><p>She also wore a similar bracelet on her wrist, but no other adornments.  The features visible beneath her veil were almost flawlessly delicate; her lips were slightly pursed, revealing only a faint touch of color.</p><p>Her eyes were closed, a faint, ethereal glow surrounding her, separating her from the world, aloof and solitary.</p><p>These two women were Shi Xue and Liu Li, the ones mentioned by the Xuan Tian Palace elder.</p><p>Shi Xue looked at the darkness outside, finally abandoning the idea of testing the barrier.  She turned her gaze to Liu Li, who remained motionless, a slight smile playing on her lips as she teasingly remarked, “Junior Sister, you refused to change into that dress. Anyone seeing you in this attire will surely guess our connection to Xuan Tian Palace. This robe is too formal, it doesn’t do justice to your beauty!  Well, perhaps it's for the best. It prevents those old demons from discovering such a stunning beauty, and carrying you off to be their wife. Then I'd have nothing left to admire.”</p><p>Liu Li slowly opened her eyes, her pupils deep, like pools of dark blue light, ethereal and somewhat lonely.</p><p>Seeming displeased with Shi Xue’s words, a flicker of emotion crossed Liu Li's face, her eyebrows furrowing slightly.</p><p>“Alright, alright…”</p><p>Shi Xue quickly appeased her, “How could I let our beautiful junior sister fall into the hands of those demons? If Master knew in the heavens, he’d surely scold me!”</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>Liu Li paused, repeating the word softly.</p><p>Shi Xue, realizing she’d misspoken, quickly changed the subject. “Junior Sister, if we can find suitable treasures at the Demon Assembly, let’s go to Di Tong Island on our way back. We can try to obtain some Di Tong fruits. You could attempt to break through your bottleneck; with luck, you might successfully cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light to its peak, meeting the Saint Land’s requirements.”</p><p>Seeing her junior sister nod imperceptibly, Shi Xue breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Knowing her junior sister's reserved nature, she continued, “Junior Sister, have you noticed anything unusual lately? I think I saw people from the Enforcement Hall in the city, perhaps even an elder.”</p><p>Liu Li seemed distracted, pausing before realizing her senior sister was asking her a question. Her eyes flickered, and she replied calmly,</p><p>“Possibly.”</p><p>Satisfied with the answer, Shi Xue twisted the bracelet on her wrist and continued, “The Enforcement Hall’s actions aren’t easily noticed, so their target probably isn’t us, and they haven't tried to hide from us.  Is something big going to happen at the Demon Assembly? I feel strangely uneasy.  Sigh, there are not only powerful demons on the island but also a great Yaozu saint. If we encounter trouble, we should immediately ask the elder for help…”</p><p>Before she finished, the bracelet suddenly glowed faintly.</p><p>Shi Xue’s mouth parted slightly. She abruptly stood up, her spiritual sense scanning the bracelet.  Exchanging a look with Liu Li, she whispered in surprise, “It's Elder Mei…”</p><p>Then, Shi Xue cautiously set up a barrier around them, gently tapping a crystal on the bracelet.  Elder Mei's familiar voice echoed from within.</p><p>“Shi Xue, Liu Li, are you on Lake Heart Island?”</p><p>Shi Xue replied in a low voice, “Yes! Elder Mei, what’s happened?”</p><p>…</p><p>While Shi Xue and Elder Mei conversed in hushed tones, Liu Li stood up from her bamboo chair, her hands resting on her knees, her gaze fixed on the darkness outside the bamboo building.</p><p>Gradually, her brow furrowed deeper, her lips pressed tightly together, and a hint of puzzlement appeared in her eyes.</p><p>Elder Mei quickly summarized the situation.</p><p>Shi Xue was shocked, bombarding the speaker with questions before finally accepting the unbelievable news: the sacred artifact of Xuan Tian Palace had been stolen by a traitor!</p><p>"Remember to stay hidden, avoid the Dark Sorcerer's minions.  Elder Lan and I will be waiting for you outside the island,"</p><p>Elder Mei cut off the communication.</p><p>The bracelet's light extinguished.</p><p>Shi Xue's expression was grave, tinged with anxiety. "Elder Mei ordered us to leave Dark Sorcerer Island immediately and help recover the sacred artifact. What should we do?"</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Liuli looked away, her expression returning to normal. She turned and walked towards the door.</p><p>…</p><p>In another bamboo hut.</p><p>Qin Sang remained oblivious to the turmoil outside.</p><p>He appeared to be resting with his eyes closed, but he was actually monitoring the mysterious ice box.</p><p>Up to this point, the ice box showed no unusual activity.  This made it difficult for Qin Sang to determine whether Xuan Tian Palace could sense the ice box; he could only pay attention to his surroundings when leaving.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>The mist on Lake Heart Island parted frequently, revealing Yuan Ying Masters arriving on the island, guided by the puppet maidservants into the bamboo huts.</p><p>Remaining in his hut, Qin Sang couldn't see what was happening outside, so he had no way of knowing how many Yuan Ying Masters had arrived.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>Suddenly, a bell tolled.</p><p>Then, the protective barrier outside the hut was triggered. Qin Sang called for entry, and a puppet maidservant entered carrying a jade token.  Already familiar with the Wan Mo Assembly rules, Qin Sang took the token and examined it carefully.</p><p>Later, when the trading session began, participants would take turns describing the treasures they wished to acquire or sell.</p><p>The jade token would light up to indicate Qin Sang's turn.</p><p>Of course, many people didn't have specific goals and could activate the token's restriction to skip their turn.</p><p>Furthermore, the token served as a disguise; everyone's voice would be exactly the same.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>Two more bell tolls followed in quick succession.</p><p>Three bell tolls—the trading session began!</p><p>"The time has come.  Those who should be here have arrived. The trading session will now commence!"</p><p>A deep, old voice boomed from outside the hut.</p><p>Elder Zhongtai!</p><p>The name flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  This individual had presided over the last two Wan Mo Assemblies.  He was said to be immensely powerful, only a step away from becoming a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>"The procedures are as the puppet maidservants have explained. I won't waste your time reiterating them. The rules remain the same… I trust you won't disappoint us!"</p><p>The elder's voice echoed, both a reminder and a warning to everyone on Lake Heart Island.</p>
