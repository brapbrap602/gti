<h1>Chapter 900: Interconnected Events</h1><p>Those present were all cunning and experienced individuals, naturally not easily fooled.</p><p>However, it was true that Lan Dou Sect had two Yuan Ying Masters.  Lu, the sect leader, publicly acknowledged the other party as a fellow sect member from the most mysterious lineage.</p><p>Furthermore, they didn't know what was happening inside the Bamboo Pavilion; they only heard the accusations, not Lu's rebuttal.</p><p>Although the Bamboo Pavilion was shrouded in a sea of blood, unlike righteous methods, everyone was unaware of Dou Niu Peak's true teachings.  Keeping it so secret certainly had a reason; even if they cultivated some demonic art, it wouldn't be surprising.</p><p>Various coincidences intertwined, leading them to become suspicious.</p><p>If they got involved in Lan Dou Sect's internal conflict, their own safety was secondary.  If their sect was implicated, a single misstep could lead to the destruction of their ancestors' legacy.</p><p>With the situation unclear, everyone was hesitant, closely watching the Bamboo Pavilion, considering many things, unsure whether or how to intervene.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang didn't expect to keep the secret for long.  As long as they could restrain Lu, once his junior disciples succeeded, they would immediately retreat.</p><p>…</p><p>Amidst the chaos, nobody noticed that Daoist Mingyue had disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang was speeding towards his avatar's location.</p><p>He held the Qingfu coins; the daughter coin had clearly returned.</p><p>Before the incident in the Bamboo Pavilion, Qin Sang sensed something strange with the Qingfu coins, discovering a message from his avatar, indicating an unknown event. Just as he was anxiously trying to figure out how to escape, the attack on the Bamboo Pavilion began.</p><p>Lan Dou Sect's internal strife involved Dou Niu Peak, which he was most concerned about.</p><p>He was naturally incredibly curious about what happened in the Bamboo Pavilion, but he never expected his avatar to get into trouble at this time.</p><p>Now, he could only put this aside, seize the opportunity to escape, and rescue his avatar first.</p><p>"My avatar has the Devouring Yuan Cone and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. What on Dongming Island could threaten him?  It's a terrible coincidence they clashed. I wish I hadn't let him go out…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed regretfully.</p><p>He used his escape technique with all his might, racing against time, and quickly arrived near Lan Dou Sect's territory.</p><p>At this time, he saw chaotic escape lights flying towards him, clearly Lan Dou Sect disciples who had discovered the anomaly at the entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang melted into the shadows, his speed not slowing down in the slightest. He slipped past them, and soon after, Qin Sang finally sensed his avatar's location, his heart suddenly relieved.</p><p>His avatar was safe.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, silently passing through the restriction, simultaneously capturing his avatar's thoughts, learning about his recent experiences, and was instantly astonished.</p><p>"Go with them, and escape!"</p><p>Qin Sang made a decisive decision, arranging for his avatar to withdraw.</p><p>The avatar was no longer needed. He needed to get away from the conflict as soon as possible and find a safe place to hide, to avoid being implicated.</p><p>He was just a Qi Condensation cultivator; as long as he was careful enough, those experts wouldn't notice him.</p><p>The avatar nodded slightly and left.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the mountaintop, looking at the dark forest ahead, still with a surprised expression. He never expected things to develop like this; he seemed to have run into an old enemy.</p><p>The avatar and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly discovered Zhao Songqiao's unusual behavior and witnessed Zhao Songqiao releasing a Wu tribe insect Gu.</p><p>This made the avatar think of the Black Serpent Mountain cultivators who had infiltrated human territory and also harmed his main body.</p><p>The avatar felt it was unlikely to be such a coincidence, but he could be certain that Zhao Songqiao was backed by a group of Wu tribe cultivators, also eyeing Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>However, he didn't know their purpose.  Why would they arrange someone to sneak into the Dark Thunder Wood forest with an insect Gu?</p><p>Therefore, the avatar ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly not to disturb Zhao Songqiao and to observe the situation.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao released the insect Gu and continued flying into the forest, eventually reaching the deepest part of the forest, the edge of the Dongming Island formation, sealed by white mist.</p><p>Then he took out more than a dozen black flags the avatar had never seen before and planted them in a nearby empty space, disappearing without a trace; they seemed to be some kind of forbidden artifact.</p><p>Then he stopped moving, seemingly waiting for a certain moment.</p><p>The insect Gu began flying around the forest, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly followed the insect Gu, seeing it finally stop above an inconspicuous pool, pausing slightly before returning to Zhao Songqiao's side.</p><p>If not for the insect Gu leading the way, others would hardly notice anything unusual here.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly looked at the pool and discovered that it was sealed by a restriction, far stronger than the two restrictions he had seen after entering Dongming Island, incomparable.</p><p>There's definitely a secret hidden within the Lan Dou Gate!</p><p>Seeing this, just as the avatar was considering whether to inform the main body, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao and the insect Gu finally made their move.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao cast spells towards the open space, and the black flags rose from the ground, forming a large flag array.  滚滚 black smoke billowed from the flags, growing denser and denser.</p><p>Simultaneously, the insect Gu's wings fluttered, and its figure disappeared into the black smoke.</p><p>The black smoke gathered by the formation rose slowly, drifting towards the mist above. As the two distinctly colored mists met, it was like oil thrown onto a fire, a violent clash ensued.</p><p>The black smoke seemed to possess a corrosive power, gradually polluting the white mist.</p><p>At the same time, strange activity appeared outside the Dongming Island.</p><p>Seeing this, the avatar immediately understood: the enemy was coordinating an attack from both inside and outside to break the Dongming Island formation!</p><p>This formation was created by the Lan Dou Gate leader, combining the power of several sects; even a Yuan Ying master would find it difficult to break. But now, because the formation's magical power is weakened, and these flag arrays seem specifically designed to break formations, judging by the signs, with this inside-outside cooperation, they might actually be able to break through the white mist and enter.</p><p>How many people are outside the island, and what are their cultivation levels?</p><p>There shouldn't be any Yuan Ying cultivators involved, otherwise they wouldn't need to go to such lengths to infiltrate.</p><p>The avatar's cultivation is too low; worried about being exposed, it didn't dare to stay nearby. It quickly crushed a Qingfu coin to inform the main body, and instructed the Tianmu butterfly to proceed cautiously.</p><p>After learning everything, Qin Sang immediately realized that the Bamboo Pavilion incident wasn't an internal conflict within the sect; those three Dou Niu Peak disciples were cooperating with those outside to infiltrate Dongming Island!</p><p>The control panel for the Dongming Island formation is in the hands of Master Lu. As soon as an external attack on the formation occurs, Master Lu will immediately notice it. With so many Foundation Establishment cultivators on the island, it's impossible for the enemy to simply break in.</p><p>Currently, Master Lu is trapped in the Bamboo Pavilion, sealed off by the sea of blood, unable to send a message. The attention of the others is also diverted, making it difficult to discover the anomaly here in the short term.</p><p>By the time the situation outside is resolved, these people will have already succeeded and escaped.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang connected more pieces of the puzzle.</p><p>Witch Clan insect Gu, Lan Dou Gate, Dou Niu Peak, the unknown treasure.</p><p>Dark Thunder Woods, the restricted water pool…</p><p>Black Serpent Mountain.</p><p>The mysterious figure, capable of subduing a Kui dragon and cultivating terrifying thunder techniques.</p><p>All these events seem to be interconnected!</p>
