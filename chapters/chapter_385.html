<h1>Chapter 378: Blood Rain</h1><p>Chapter 378: Blood Rain</p><p>Walking through the cracks in the restriction, the strange light was dazzling and ubiquitous, as if they were in a rainbow.</p><p>These rainbows represented danger. Qin Sang followed Yun Youzi, obediently walking along the crack, not daring to make any rash moves.</p><p>The crack wasn't entirely safe.</p><p>The map marked all the dangerous areas, allowing them to prepare accordingly.</p><p>Upon reaching the exit of the crack, Yun Youzi turned around. Qin Sang understood and summoned his magical artifact, hiding himself in the shadows, watching Yun Youzi leave.</p><p>There couldn't be an ambush inside the crack. Unless one was sure of a one-hit kill, even a slight leakage of spiritual energy, touching the ancient restriction, could trigger a counterattack.</p><p>Any thieves would only lie in wait at the exit.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a while. Yun Youzi returned, confirming there was no ambush ahead, before they both exited the restriction.</p><p>The second level of the Wuyaya Valley was similar to the first.</p><p>Only the blood clouds in the sky pressed down lower, making people feel incredibly suffocated.  At the edge of their vision, many places shone with strange lights or diffused mists of various colors.</p><p>These places were clearly not good, far denser than the first level.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>On the barren stone ridge, entirely composed of piled white stones, no vegetation grew.</p><p>Similar stone ridges were numerous in the surroundings, like protruding graves, a desolate scene.</p><p>Yun Youzi stood on the stone ridge, his breath slightly disordered, but he didn't regulate his breathing. Instead, he gazed intently into the distance, his expression showing a hint of worry.</p><p>Qin Sang was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Suddenly, Yun Youzi's eyes lit up.</p><p>A sword light, like a meteor, streaked across the sky from afar, rushing towards them and landing near the stone ridge, revealing Qin Sang's slightly disheveled figure.</p><p>"Qin Lao Di, how are you? Not injured?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed his sword, steadied himself, gasped a few times, and shook his head. "These Yin Beasts are really tenacious. Luckily, senior lured away most of them."</p><p>They were now deep within the second level of the Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>Following the map's markings, the first half of their journey was smooth, but later, the map's markings became ambiguous, many places marked with conjecture, leaving them to judge for themselves, inevitably leading to danger.</p><p>Fortunately, their cultivation was high, and they were very vigilant, managing to escape danger each time.</p><p>This time was the most dangerous. They inadvertently stumbled into a Yin Beast nest.  Caught off guard, they were separated before they could regroup, and had to agree on a meeting point, fleeing separately.</p><p>After separating, Qin Sang was able to act more freely, unleashing the living corpses and the Ten Directions Yama Formation, killing a group of Yin Beasts. He found that the Yin Beasts only turned into Yin energy upon death, leaving nothing behind, so he didn't linger and rushed to meet up.</p><p>"It's good that Qin Lao Di is alright."</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded, relieved, and looked around. "This white stone wilderness is unchanged from my memory. From here, east for over three hundred miles, lies the third level of the Wuyaya Valley, the edge of the inner valley. If the two demon groups haven't been disturbed, the path I took before should still be there."</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang turned his head to look to the left.</p><p>The dark abyss where the dragon was hiding was in the north of this wilderness.</p><p>Half a day later.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi appeared before a range of towering mountains. These mountains stretched endlessly, one majestic peak after another, reaching towards the blood clouds.</p><p>On the mountains and between the mountain ranges, layers upon layers of ancient restrictions were faintly visible, leaving no gaps, making one's scalp tingle.</p><p>"Qin Lao Di, this is the barrier to the third level of the Wuyaya Valley!"</p><p>Yun Youzi pondered for a moment, then leaped to the front of a mountain valley, gazing intently for a long time, a hint of joy appearing on his face. "Excellent! For decades, the restrictions here have remained unchanged and haven't been discovered!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed and, seeing the scene before him, his face turned pale, and he chuckled dryly. "Senior, you don't intend to cross through here, do you?"</p><p>What met their eyes was a valley raining 'blood'.</p><p>This blood rain wasn't real rain. The raindrops were actually countless red threads of light, densely filling the entire valley.  These seemingly weak threads gave Qin Sang an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p>These threads were surely a manifestation of the ancient restriction, each one as sharp as the finest sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that if he entered the valley, his body would instantly be pierced into a sieve by the blood rain, leaving no chance of survival, even the seven-colored parasol couldn't block it.</p><p>He thought Yun Youzi had found a flaw in the restriction, was he planning to force his way through?</p><p>Yun Youzi glanced at Qin Sang and said with a smile, "Don't be fooled, Qin.  This restriction, while seemingly dangerous, has been weakened by time, much like the strange light at the edge of the second level.  It has flaws, but they aren't easily visible. Watch..."</p><p>With that, Yun Youzi opened his palm, and spiritual energy materialized a sparrow which chirped and flew towards the valley.</p><p>Near the edge of the bloody rain, the sparrow paused. After a few breaths, Yun Youzi urged, "Go!"</p><p>The sparrow flew into the bloody rain, immediately causing a change.</p><p>A strange suction seemed to emanate from the sparrow, drawing in the surrounding rain. It looked as if the sparrow was about to be crushed, but the raindrops passed right through it unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang watched in astonishment as the sparrow, completely unscathed, flew into the valley.</p><p>The bloody rain seemed like an illusion.</p><p>Yun Youzi dispersed his spiritual energy, a smile on his face.  "The restriction hasn't changed, following the same pattern. The flaw doesn't always exist; it only appears for a moment at intervals.  Qin, stay close, and we'll be fine if we time it right."</p><p>Seeing Yun Youzi's confidence and having witnessed the sparrow's passage, Qin Sang felt reassured. He summoned his ebony sword and stood beside Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi stared intently at the bloody rain, motionless.</p><p>Time passed slowly. After fifteen minutes, Yun Youzi suddenly shouted, "Now!"</p><p>He then flew on his sword, charging into the bloody rain from where the sparrow had entered.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely behind.</p><p>As he entered the bloody rain, Qin Sang saw the raindrops swirling around him. He was on high alert, but soon discovered that they were harmless.  Relieved, he followed Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi moved like lightning, his path not straight but incredibly winding. It was inconceivable that anyone would dare find this route through such danger.</p><p>They had gone quite far into the valley when Yun Youzi suddenly stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a change, and lowered his sword, discovering that they were out of the bloody rain, and before them stood a cave.</p>
