<h1>Chapter 1148: Thunder Butterfly? Calamity Butterfly?</h1><p>Chapter 1148: Thunder Butterfly? Calamity Butterfly?</p><p>A glint of greed flashed in the Qianji Yao Wang's eyes, and his figure vanished on the spot.</p><p>The Yao Fei reacted swiftly, leading her subordinates in pursuit.</p><p>She knew why the Yao Wang was so excited.</p><p>Intelligent insects are rare, their innate abilities are usually limited, and their power cannot compare to that of transformed demons or Yuan Ying masters. However, most possess unique uses.  Especially those exceptionally rare insects; the power of their innate abilities might even surpass those of their level, capable of overcoming stronger opponents.</p><p>A four-stage insect is incredibly rare.  Capturing one would be akin to obtaining a treasure.</p><p>Naturally, the Yao Wang would be tempted.</p><p>The fact that such a high-level insect was hidden near the Wan Snake Abyss, and they hadn't noticed it all this time, was quite alarming.</p><p>But remembering the thief from before, a sense of foreboding washed over the Yao Fei.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>On the mountain peak.</p><p>Before the heavenly tribulation descended, Qin Sang and Bai had moved far away to protect the Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>Of course, if the Tianmu Butterfly failed, Qin Sang wouldn't give up easily. He had prepared for the worst, ready to fight no matter what.</p><p>His cultivation of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* had already broken through.</p><p>If the Tianmu Butterfly successfully advanced, it would be an unexpected bonus.</p><p>With these two boosts, Qin Sang was confident about his own breakthrough.</p><p>Bai observed the tribulation clouds, noticing Qin Sang's tense expression. He comforted him, “Don't worry, the tribulation clouds are nearing their peak; the power isn't as terrifying as you think. Your Tianmu Butterfly absorbed the Azure Luan's true blood. If it can't even survive this small tribulation, it would be a dishonor to the Azure Luan! You're just panicking; it's better to quickly regulate the remaining power within you."</p><p>“Azure Luan's true blood?”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. That Azure Luan power was from its true blood?</p><p>He hadn't felt any impact on his own blood.</p><p>Bai countered, “Though I didn't see the stone tablet, your wings can solidify, and the Tianmu Butterfly has undergone such significant changes. Besides the Azure Luan's true blood sealed within the tablet, what else could it be?”</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Bai continued, “The reason you haven't felt it is because you're human. The Azure Luan's true blood could only flow into your wings, reshaping them into phoenix wings. The pair on your back—it's not an exaggeration to call them true phoenix wings now. The Tianmu Butterfly's ability to absorb the Azure Luan's true blood is beyond my expectations, likely related to the mutation you mentioned. After this second mutation, the Tianmu Butterfly has transcended the category of mere insect, with an immeasurable future ahead!”</p><p>Bai's tone was filled with awe, envious of Qin Sang's luck in obtaining such an insect.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A tribulation thunderbolt descended from the heavens, interrupting their conversation.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively clenched his fists. After his breakthrough, both his body and phoenix wings were more stable, capable of withstanding the impact of the Azure Luan's power. He forcibly suppressed his own power and focused on the Tianmu Butterfly's tribulation.</p><p>The moment the thunderbolt appeared.</p><p>Luminous threads appeared on the Tianmu Butterfly's wings.</p><p>In an instant, its wings were enveloped in thunder.</p><p>Countless slender electric filaments intertwined, forming a thunder net that continued to solidify, eventually coalescing into a single lightning bolt centered on the Tianmu Butterfly, striking back at the tribulation thunderbolt!</p><p>Its momentum and scale were no match for the tribulation thunderbolt.</p><p>One couldn't help but wonder if it would be instantly destroyed by a single strike.</p><p>At that moment, the Tianmu Butterfly suddenly soared high, unafraid, embracing the thunder, and actively confronting the tribulation thunderbolt!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The two lightning bolts collided, the resulting spectacle shaking the heavens.</p><p>Thunder clashed and annihilated each other, leaving a silver-white expanse in the sky.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.</p><p>The lightning bolt condensed by the Tianmu Butterfly was shattered by the tribulation thunderbolt.</p><p>The tribulation thunderbolt, no longer impeded, struck directly at the Tianmu Butterfly's body.</p><p>Qin Sang was terrified and immediately rushed towards the Tianmu Butterfly without hesitation.</p><p>Bai didn't stop Qin Sang, his expression somewhat awkward. He had predicted that the Tianmu Butterfly would easily pass the tribulation, only to be proven wrong. The Tianmu Butterfly's improvement wasn't as significant as he'd imagined.</p><p>“Could it be that it awakened too early, lacking sufficient foundation?”</p><p>Bai pondered, glancing behind him warily at the Yao Wang.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang moved, another change occurred.</p><p>The tribulation thunderbolt descended again in an instant.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly gently vibrated its wings, and its eyes suddenly opened wide. Two beams of strange light shot out from its eyes.  Green and silver light flickered alternately, like two sharp swords, piercing into the tribulation thunderbolt!</p><p>Qin Sang stopped short in astonishment.</p><p>He saw that after being struck by the light, the tribulation thunderbolt was torn apart, dissipating before it could even reach the Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>Then, an even more shocking sight unfolded.</p><p>The two beams of light converged in mid-air, forming a net.</p><p>At this time, the tribulation thunderbolt hadn't completely dissipated. Its last trace of lightning was captured by the light net.</p><p>Then, the light net and the tribulation thunder were forcibly drawn into Tianmu Butterfly's Tianmu (Third Eye).</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The thunder power on Tianmu Butterfly went haywire.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly transmitted a painful consciousness; its body trembled, forcibly closing its Tianmu, and gradually calmed down.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>Bai's eyes went wide.</p><p>"Controlling tribulation thunder?"</p><p>Bai's expression contorted, his voice distorted.</p><p>Qin Sang was even more shocked by Tianmu Butterfly's actions.</p><p>Tribulation thunder is no ordinary thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang, possessing the  "Thunder Control Technique,"  knew the difference well. He practiced this secret technique by summoning thunder during storms, but he would never dare to do this with tribulation thunder—unless he wanted to die.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly, audacious as it was, dared to capture tribulation thunder and swallow it, seemingly succeeding.</p><p>Even a sliver is unimaginable to ordinary people.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had to believe Bai's words.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly, having absorbed the Azure Luan's true blood, combined with its original mysterious Tianmu ability, created a chain reaction that enabled this incredible feat; otherwise, it's hard to explain.</p><p>"Phoenix Butterfly? Thunder Butterfly? Or... Tribulation Butterfly?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared blankly at Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>Overnight, he realized he no longer knew his own spirit insect.</p><p>Transformation and mutation weren't the end; Tianmu Butterfly gave him a greater surprise—absorbing tribulation thunder.</p><p>The tribulation ended. Tianmu Butterfly quietly floated in the void. After absorbing the tribulation thunder, no new changes appeared, but Qin Sang knew it wouldn't be that simple.</p><p>If it can absorb tribulation thunder at the fourth transformation, what about the fifth, or even the legendary ninth?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine.</p><p>'Whew!'</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly's breath gradually calmed. Suddenly, it flashed, rushing into Qin Sang's embrace like a young swallow.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly opened his arms and held it close.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly hugged him tightly, gently rubbing against him, conveying affection, fear, and affection—far clearer and more accurate than before, indicating a higher level of intelligence.</p><p>"Go! The tribulation is over, but the Qieji Demon King is catching up!"</p><p>Bai warned gravely, retreating into the corpse puppet bag.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, allowing Tianmu Butterfly to return to his Qi Sea to recover.</p><p>He glanced back, crushed a Qingfu coin to signal the willow spirit to leave, and with a tap of his foot, his phoenix wings flapped, transforming into a green light and speeding away.</p><p>After breaking through in the  "Sky Demon Refining Form," he no longer feared transformed great demons as before, but the Azure Luan power within him was not yet fully subdued, hindering his combat abilities.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The green light tore through the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced. After his breakthrough, his escape speed had increased significantly; shaking off the Qieji Demon King would be no problem.</p>
