<h1>Chapter 1561: The Innate Wooden Man Stele</h1><p>“Wood spirit aura?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression darkened.</p><p>He had known Lu Zhang for decades and understood his strength fairly well.  Even against a powerful cultivator, Lu Zhang should have been able to hold his own for a while, not be completely helpless.</p><p>He never imagined the opponent's poison would be so potent, rendering Lu Zhang incapacitated in a single exchange.  Even more unexpected was that the attacker targeted him.</p><p>He was full of questions.</p><p>What kind of aura did this person refer to as “wood spirit aura”?</p><p>Bai had clearly stated that the Evolution Dao Tree, though a spirit tree, was an immaculate entity, incredibly pure.</p><p>Having refined an external manifestation from the Evolution Dao Tree, Qin Sang himself hadn’t sensed any unusual aura from it.</p><p>Before this, no one had ever discovered the tree's true nature.</p><p>Especially after his Nascent Soul transformed into a real Core Formation, even the external manifestation's identity was concealed; his main body and manifestation played their respective roles, and Lu Zhang was still unaware of the truth.</p><p>Of course, this was also due to Qin Sang’s cautious approach. He had always avoided having his manifestation directly confront powerful cultivators. Even when visiting Mount Unknowing, he carefully chose the time to avoid the sect leader.</p><p>Unexpectedly, an accident happened.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man sized Qin Sang up and down, his greed unconcealed. His eyes seemed to strip Qin Sang bare. He took a deep breath, a look of intoxication twisting his features, making him appear even more terrifying.</p><p>“Such purity, truly unprecedented in my lifetime! Could it be the legendary Ten Divine Trees? Heaven has favored me! I was just about to cultivate the Innate Wooden Man Stele, and fate has delivered you to me…”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The jade insect flew back into the grotesque-faced man's hand.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man played with the jade insect, calmly saying, “Hand it over, and I’ll give you a fair exchange – one treasure for both your lives!”</p><p>His tone was confident.</p><p>And he had reason to be confident.</p><p>Although he hadn’t managed to poison Lu Zhang to death as he had planned, his accomplishment was still astonishing.  A respected Law Enforcement Elder of Mount Unknowing, seriously injured in a single encounter and forced to retreat into his protective bell, his fate unknown.</p><p>From his earlier probe, the grotesque-faced man could tell that the protective bell was extraordinary, likely Lu Zhang's strongest life-saving technique, and difficult to break in a short time.</p><p>For someone of Lu Zhang's background, not having such a life-saving technique would be more surprising.</p><p>However, the grotesque-faced man was certain that Lu Zhang was poisoned by the Gu King and wouldn't easily regain his fighting strength.</p><p>…</p><p>So, the opponent hadn’t discovered the Evolution Dao Tree.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, staring at the grotesque-faced man’s vine-like arm and branch-like hand, vaguely guessing the reason. He suspected it was related to the man's cultivation techniques and unique spiritual perception.</p><p>The opponent was after his main body—he certainly couldn’t hand it over.</p><p>Earlier, Lu Zhang, using his remaining strength, had broken free from the grotesque-faced man's grasp and landed not far from Qin Sang, transmitting a message in his final moments, his voice weak, barely a whisper.</p><p>“I have a way to suppress the potent poison. The Sitting Meditation Bell can help us escape.  Please buy us some time…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Sitting Meditation Bell, his mind racing. He said coldly, “First, you ambush and attempt to steal, then poison your opponent, and you still dare to speak of fair trade?  Is that not laughable?”</p><p>As he spoke, the Snow-Stepping Divine Blade flew back. Qin Sang grabbed the Sitting Meditation Bell and fled.</p><p>“Incorrigible!”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man sneered. “Kill him!”</p><p>No reminder was necessary; the grey-robed man had already attacked.  He was more focused on Lu Zhang within the Sitting Meditation Bell.  After all, whatever treasure his master obtained from Qin Sang was his master's; the stone toad was his.</p><p>The five-colored whip crackled, streaks of poisonous whip shadows exploding in the air like blossoming poisonous flowers, ubiquitous, vibrant yet deadly.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man’s right hand remained in its vine form, his rough palm spread wide, grabbing a wooden bead.  Intense green light suddenly erupted from his palm.</p><p>Where the light shone, life spread across the smooth stones and walls, sprouting tender green shoots, vibrant and alive.</p><p>The shoots grew rapidly, forming patches of grass, wild weeds transforming into countless vines.  The vines were covered in sharp thorns, more agile than snakes, and shot out.</p><p>In an instant, the entire space became a tangled web of vines.</p><p>Qin Sang’s vision was filled with intense green, with poisonous flowers blooming around him. His situation was extremely dangerous.</p><p>However, his face showed no anxiety as he held the Sitting Meditation Bell.</p><p>The Sitting Meditation Bell was light; he felt no weight in his hand.</p><p>As he held the bell, Qin Sang sensed its power rapidly draining away, a shocking sight.</p><p>Lu Zhang had nearly died; although his life was saved for now, it came at a great cost. The Sitting Meditation Bell might be destroyed because of this.</p><p>Lu Zhang transmitted a message before escaping into the Zuo Nian Zhong, and was never heard from again.</p><p>Qin Sang was now facing two opponents, one of whom was a powerful cultivator.  </p><p>It's a pity my true body isn't here; otherwise, they wouldn't dare act so arrogantly!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, dismissing distracting thoughts.  A large, energy hand burst forth from the top of his head.  The hand grasped, solidifying the surrounding vines.  Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang unleashed the Ta Xue Divine Blade, slashing backward to forcibly carve a path through the countless vines, retreating rapidly outward. He had to abandon the Bao Se Bell, unable to retrieve it.</p><p>The blade's energy surged like a tide, collapsing one stone wall after another.  The underground area was in utter chaos. Low-level cultivators searching for treasures in the basin felt the ground tremble repeatedly, mistaking it for an earthquake at the basin's center.</p><p>Qin Sang fled quickly, but the vines pursued even faster.  The strange-faced man, holding a wooden bead, remained stationary while countless vines, like surging waves, propelled him forward, flattening everything in their path.  Green light moved with his figure. Wherever the green light passed, the weeds and vines withered and disappeared at a visible speed, while new vines grew in their place.</p><p>Qin Sang fearlessly charged directly through the poisonous flowers.  Poison seeped through his protective energy and entered his body.  He realized the poison acted similarly to miasma, primarily threatening the physical body, and having a limited effect on him, so he ignored it.  If it had been the Gu King's poison used by the strange-faced man, he wouldn't have been so careless. However, the strange-faced man showed no signs of using the Gu King.</p><p>Seeing his meticulously cultivated poison techniques proving ineffective, the man in gray robes was both shocked and furious. He hastily retracted his five-colored whip, whistled sharply, and summoned five-colored poisonous spiders to pursue Qin Sang.  Behind him, waves of vines surged, with the strange-faced man appearing and disappearing.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed the Four-Riding Serpent Seal in his sleeve but didn't rush to use it. Deploying a spiritual treasure would undoubtedly improve his situation. However, spiritual treasures consumed vast amounts of energy, and the strange-faced man wouldn't stand there to be attacked. He needed to consider how to escape if the treasure failed to repel his opponents.</p><p>Lu Zhang had claimed to have an escape method, but Qin Sang wasn't going to entrust his life entirely to another person.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang suddenly changed direction, not upward, but unexpectedly plunged into the depths of the earth.  The deeper he went, the denser the miasma became, obscuring vision and hindering his opponents' perception. He could allow the poisonous miasma to envelop his body without resistance, suppressing his energy fluctuations to the minimum to conceal his whereabouts.  The prerequisite was to temporarily shake off his pursuers.</p>
