<h1>Chapter 1617: Who is the Mantis, Who is the Oriole?</h1><p>Taiyue Sect.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon intensified.</p><p>A massive hole had been torn in the sky, and the Immortal Mansion was shining into reality.</p><p>The storm within the passage showed no sign of abating, but the expansion of its edges gradually slowed. According to Zhu Wudao, the passage was stabilizing.</p><p>However, the altar trembled far more violently than before, and the force grew stronger. Cultivators on the periphery were flung away, only Mo Xingdao, the Cave Master of Qiling Cave, and a few others managed to hold their ground.</p><p>After a while, the breathing of Zhu Wudao's group of five also grew ragged.</p><p>Zhu Wudao gritted his teeth, his expression grim, staring fixedly at the passage above without a word. Without his command, Su Zinan and the others dared not release their hold, only persevering.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>It felt incredibly long to them.</p><p>Finally, the passage stopped expanding, suspended above Taiyue Sect. The turbulent flow remained terrifying, but now it was possible to enter.</p><p>Of course, those who dared to enter still had to be extremely cautious, lest they face utter destruction.</p><p>Zhu Wudao gave the order.</p><p>"Enter!"</p><p>The altar trembled, carrying everyone skyward. They plunged headfirst into the passage and vanished in an instant, swallowed by the turbulent flow.</p><p>The other disciples of the Formless Immortal Sect split into two groups.</p><p>One group, confident in their strength, banded together and followed Zhu Wudao into the passage.</p><p>The others, seeking stability, led their disciples to withdraw from Taiyue Mountain. Firstly, to wait for the turbulence to weaken, and secondly, to prevent retaliation from Taiyue Mountain. They would soon be grateful for their decision.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the distance, using his enhanced vision to observe everything.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others entered the passage, and the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect retreated.</p><p>For a time, the entrance to the passage fell into a brief period of calm.</p><p>Judging by the intensity of the turbulent flow, it wouldn't be easy to force entry, so there was no need to rush.</p><p>Qin Sang was in no hurry to leave. He stood still, his gaze sweeping back and forth, searching for the Eight Sceneries Sect. The legacy had appeared, would True Person Zilei not reveal himself?</p><p>His gaze swept over the mountain peaks. He saw escaping lights flickering at the edge of the Taiyue Mountain range. The nearby cultivators had been alerted by the celestial phenomenon and were rushing towards it, but he didn't see any cultivators from the Eight Sceneries Sect.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's gaze was drawn to the main peak of Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>When the celestial phenomenon erupted,</p><p>Both the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation and Taiyue Mountain's protective formation were breached from within. However, the protective formation was rooted in the earth and the main peak, its foundation not destroyed, and could be easily repaired.</p><p>On the main peak,</p><p>The formation shimmered, and several figures flew out. The leader was none other than Hua Chenzi, the Grand Elder of Taiyue Mountain.</p><p>The remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect hadn't gone far, but there was no time to settle accounts with them now.</p><p>Hua Chenzi looked around and channeled his Qi to form talismans.</p><p>Dozens of Profound Yellow Talismans floated before him. Then, Hua Chenzi pointed his fingers repeatedly, and streams of light shot out, embedding the Profound Yellow Talismans into the various peaks of Taiyue Sect.</p><p>The earth rumbled.</p><p>The mountains shook.</p><p>The protective formation reactivated!</p><p>No one stopped Hua Chenzi, and this step was completed smoothly.</p><p>Then, an astonishing scene unfolded.</p><p>Dust and smoke suddenly rose from the ground. Under the influence of the formation, the main peak and several other crucial peaks of Taiyue Sect sank deep into the earth. A thick layer of profound yellow light enveloped the ground, then slowly contracted into the size of a mirror, also vanishing into the earth.</p><p>It was foreseeable that a fierce struggle would revolve around the Formless Immortal Sect in the near future.</p><p>It was unknown how many experts would be drawn here.</p><p>Unless someone moved the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Taiyue Sect was close by, its foundation here. If they didn't find a way to protect it, in case it was affected, the sect was in danger of being destroyed.</p><p>"Without the Sect Master's and my orders, no one is allowed to leave!"</p><p>Hua Chenzi's voice echoed into the earth.</p><p>At the same time,</p><p>Outside Taiyue Sect, radiant light burst forth from a valley.</p><p>Qin Sang, watching from afar, reacted slightly, thinking that the main players had finally appeared!</p><p>The radiant light, like shimmering moonlight, arced across the void and landed before Hua Chenzi.</p><p>Both parties were acquainted and dispensed with formalities, nodding to each other. They looked at the empty passage, their expressions varied.</p><p>Moonlight flowed like water around True Person Zilei. Each person had a bright moon suspended behind their head, their Qi interconnected. It turned out they were also preparing a formation.</p><p>Gazing at the passage, True Person Zilei pondered.</p><p>Yue Lingtian said in a deep voice, "The Formless Immortal Sect's formation is more powerful than expected. The Five Phase Tokens and that altar are the keys to opening the legacy. They should also provide protection and guidance within the turbulent flow. The remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect are numerous and powerful. If they get there first, Fellow Daoist Hegao alone may not be able to stop them."</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>True Person Zilei remained calm. "Fortunately, we also have preparations, and they don't have all five tokens. The altar shouldn't last much longer."</p><p>Saying this, True Person Zilei activated a talisman and crushed it.</p><p>The moonlight behind everyone brightened, enveloping Hua Chenzi and the others.</p><p>Their figures blurred, and they entered the passage, guided by the formation.</p><p>"Both sides are prepared, with numerous experts. I only have my avatar accompanying me, which is somewhat insufficient…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. After the Eight Sceneries Sect and Taiyue Sect cultivators disappeared, he finally moved.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang and his avatar were about to depart, they abruptly stopped.</p><p>A black mist suddenly rose from the former site of Taiyue Sect, circling the entrance of the passage twice, observing carefully before flashing into the passage.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly in surprise. Although he hadn't approached, his spiritual sense detected a hint of threat from the black mist.</p><p>"Could it be another Grand Cultivator? Was this person invited by one of the sides, or did they happen to be passing by? Just how many mysterious experts are there still hidden in Zhongzhou?"</p><p>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</p><p>Just how many mantises and how many orioles are there?</p><p>The waters of the Formless Immortal Sect might be even murkier than imagined!</p><p>Qin Sang no longer hesitated, and he and his avatar flew towards the bottom of the passage.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The closer they got, the more they felt the might of the turbulent flow.</p><p>The passage was dim and filled with visible chaotic energy, not entirely without pattern, clearly showing fluctuations of layers of restrictions and formations.</p><p>But this wasn't good news. It might be necessary to break through formations while resisting the onslaught, making it even more difficult!</p><p>The power and chaos here were no less than that of the Hall of Delusion. However, the interior of the Formless Immortal Sect was complete, so there shouldn't be any Grey Tide.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Golden Sinking Sword, using its sword light to clear the path.</p><p>His avatar kept a distance from his main body, wielding the Snow-Treading Divine Saber, remaining vigilant.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly focused on the depths of the passage, pushing its Celestial Eye power to the limit, peering through the chaotic scene to guide him.</p><p>Though Qin Sang came alone, he wasn't lonely.</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang entered,</p><p>The first wave of cultivators attracted by the celestial phenomenon arrived, mostly Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Arriving here, they witnessed a scene even more shocking than the celestial phenomenon.</p><p>"Where is Taiyue Sect?"</p><p>They stared at the empty ground, dumbfounded.</p><p>These people mostly came from the outer regions of Taiyue Mountain, from smaller sects and cultivation families, more or less connected to Taiyue Sect. Some had even visited Taiyue Sect just a few days ago.</p><p>The less important outer peaks remained, but the main peak and other core areas had vanished, razed to the ground overnight, leaving them terrified!</p><p>"Was it caused by the celestial phenomenon?"</p><p>Someone gulped, their voice trembling. "Who would dare to go in there?"</p><p>"Didn't we see someone go in just now? It must lead to a secret realm. The storm should weaken; it can't stay this dangerous forever. There must be a way…"</p><p>A cultivator in green robes looked at the passage with anticipation. Before he could finish his sentence, a short scream echoed.</p><p>A cultivator, too close to the passage, was caught by the escaping turbulent flow. Before he could escape, he was swept inside, leaving no trace.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone was horrified and retreated, circling the outer area, not daring to approach.</p><p>At this moment, a streak of light shot from the sky, stopping before the passage. A vigorous old man appeared, the first Nascent Soul cultivator drawn by the celestial phenomenon.</p><p>"It's the Patriarch of Magpie Mountain!" someone whispered.</p><p>The Magpie Mountain Patriarch stared at the passage for a moment, pondered briefly, then raised his right hand. His thumb ring flashed, and a spiritual crow flew out, cawing twice before diving into the passage.</p><p>The Magpie Mountain Patriarch stared at his thumb ring, seemingly lost in thought, but actually sensing the crow.</p><p>A short while later,</p><p>The Magpie Mountain Patriarch's expression changed slightly, and his right hand trembled. The thumb ring suddenly dimmed.</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>A burst of laughter echoed from behind.</p><p>Space distorted, and a short, stout cultivator appeared beside the Magpie Mountain Patriarch. "It seems it's even more chaotic inside than outside. It seems you've suffered a small setback, old man!"</p><p>The Magpie Mountain Patriarch lost some face and snorted coldly. "Old Ghost Chou, you're welcome to try it yourself!"</p><p>"No need to try. Even if I force my way in, I'll be struggling. Why not wait for a few more fellow Daoists and enter together?" Old Ghost Chou suggested, glancing sideways.</p><p>The Magpie Mountain Patriarch didn't refuse, looking down at the ground. "Has Taiyue Sect truly been leveled?"</p><p>"Absolutely impossible!"</p><p>Old Ghost Chou said with certainty. "Yue Lingtian seems crude, but he's actually very deep. There's no way he'd be so easily destroyed. Taiyue Mountain secretly possesses the 'Thick Earth Record,' unmatched in the earth element arts. They likely have a way to connect with the earth veins and hide their sect. The celestial phenomenon was most likely created by Yue Lingtian!"</p><p>The Magpie Mountain Patriarch nodded, gazing at the mirage deep within the passage.</p><p>Old Ghost Chou asked, "Did you think of something?"</p><p>"Didn't you?" the Magpie Mountain Patriarch retorted.</p><p>After waiting for a while, several more Nascent Soul cultivators were drawn to the scene.</p><p>Old Ghost Chou and the others attempted to enter once, but found the passage too deep. They were a disorganized group, fighting individually, unable to last long. They retreated again to discuss formations.</p><p>Just then, two figures arrived gracefully.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please wait…"</p><p>Old Ghost Chou instinctively invited them, but upon seeing their faces and cultivation levels, his expression froze. He instantly regretted his words, wishing he could slap himself.</p><p>The Magpie Mountain Patriarch and the others' expressions also changed drastically, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p><p>The newcomers were none other than the Poison King and Master Huaixin.</p><p>Master Huaixin wasn't well-known in Zhongzhou, but the Poison King's reputation was formidable.</p><p>The Poison King, with a faint smile, landed before them, glancing at the passage and then at the former site of Taiyue Sect. "Can fellow Daoists tell this King what has happened to Taiyue Sect?"</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the passage.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and the others propelled the altar with the Five Phase Tokens, constantly pushing forward. The five-colored light couldn't penetrate far in the turbulent flow, compressed into an oval-shaped shield that enveloped them.</p><p>The Five Phase Tokens were indeed worthy treasures of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Protected by the shield, the pressure on them greatly decreased.</p><p>The formations and restrictions of the passage dissipated silently upon contact with the shield, posing no obstacle. The turbulent flow generated by the agitated formations was also weakened.</p><p>Unfortunately, the good times didn't last.</p><p>As time went on, the flaws of the replica tokens became apparent. Zhu Wudao had previously used other methods to forcibly maintain the balance between the tokens, but now he couldn't sustain it any longer.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The altar rocked violently, and the light of the Five Phase Tokens fluctuated wildly, their power unstable.</p><p>The two replica tokens, in particular, became the weakest points!</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Seeing the situation was hopeless, Zhu Wudao warned, withdrawing his hands and retreating.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others weren't slow either, instantly separating from the altar.</p><p>With a loud 'boom,' the altar exploded.</p><p>Fragments scattered, immediately swallowed by the turbulent flow and reduced to dust.</p><p>The Five Phase Tokens were also blasted away.</p><p>Five streaks of light were conspicuous within the turbulent flow.</p><p>Seeing that they were about to be swept away by the turbulent flow,</p><p>Golden light erupted from Zhu Wudao's eyes, and beams of light shot towards the Gold Phase Token. The Gold Phase Token froze in place, enveloped by a small golden sphere. Pulled by the golden light, Zhu Wudao retrieved it.</p><p>The strange-faced man and the swordsman did the same.</p><p>The swordsman was even faster than Zhu Wudao. While retreating, he casually unleashed a blade of energy, disrupting the trajectory of the Earth Phase Token and easily retrieving it.</p><p>The strange-faced man transformed his arm into a wooden vine, wrapping around the Wood Phase Token and bringing it back to him.</p><p>However, the two replica tokens weren't so lucky. Zhu Wudao refining replica tokens to serve as keys to open the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy was already the limit of his abilities.</p><p>Su Zinan and the white-robed man went to grab their tokens, but just as they were about to succeed, the replica tokens exploded in their hands, whether due to the altar's explosion or their energy being depleted, or perhaps both.</p><p>The white-robed man watched helplessly as the token fragments were swept away by the turbulent flow, a frustrated grunt coming from beneath his mask.</p><p>Su Zinan managed to grab a handful of fragments, but they were clearly beyond repair.</p><p>His expression darkened slightly, then quickly returned to normal. He inconspicuously glanced at Zhu Wudao, the strange-faced man, and the swordsman. Seeing they had all retrieved their Five Phase Tokens, unable to rely on a single token to navigate the formation, he gave up.</p><p>Having lost the altar's protection,</p><p>Zhu Wudao and the others were still manageable, but the others struggled to cope.</p><p>The passage was open, the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy lay ahead. Without external threats and having lost the basis for cooperation, various thoughts arose within them. It was difficult to cooperate sincerely again.</p><p>Although they didn't disperse immediately, Su Zinan and the others tacitly maintained a certain distance, each acting independently.</p><p>Those with weaker cultivation could only continue to huddle together, gradually falling behind.</p><p>A similar situation occurred behind them.</p><p>The Eight Sceneries Sect and Taiyue Sect joined forces, navigating the formation. Initially, they advanced rapidly, but their speed gradually slowed as they went deeper.</p><p>Although the formation ensured their safety, it somewhat hindered the speed of True Person Zilei and Yue Lingtian.</p><p>"Junior brothers, please send this poor Daoist and Sect Master Yue ahead. You can follow later!"</p><p>Having not seen Zhu Wudao and the others for a while, True Person Zilei grew impatient.</p><p>Being fellow disciples, sharing both glory and loss, the Nascent Soul cultivators naturally didn't object. They immediately changed their formation, surrounding True Person Zilei and Yue Lingtian in the center, combining their power to clear the path ahead for them.</p><p>The two's speed surged, their figures vanishing without a trace.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Tomorrow is New Year's Eve, Happy New Year everyone!</p><p>I wanted to add another chapter today, but I really couldn't write it. I couldn't calm down at all, pacing back and forth before finally grinding out this chapter. I apologize.</p><p>I'll take a break during the New Year and update on the second day. Just consider it a three-day break.</p><p>It's a good stopping point before entering the legacy. I'll carefully organize my thoughts and strive to present the most exciting content after the New Year.</p>
