<h1>Chapter 1020: Sunü</h1><p>Soon after.</p><p>Sunü was startled awake. She abruptly turned her head to look behind her, her face full of vigilance. "Who's there!" she shouted.</p><p>"Junior Sister, don't worry, it's me."</p><p>A figure flashed out, it was the handsome young man.</p><p>"Senior Brother..."</p><p>Sunü's expression relaxed, the vigilance in her eyes dissipating, as if she trusted the young man completely.  She let out a long sigh of relief, a radiant smile of extreme joy appearing on her face. "Senior Brother arrived first! Where are the others?" she asked in a delicate voice.</p><p>The young man was momentarily stunned by Sunü's bright smile.</p><p>But he didn't notice that as she spoke, a complex look flashed in Sunü's eyes.</p><p>"They should be here soon. I didn't expect the first trial to be a puppet battle. Otherwise, we could have met in the previous stage..."</p><p>The handsome young man walked forward. He then noticed the blood on the ice and Sunü's condition. His expression immediately became anxious. "Junior Sister, are you injured?" he asked repeatedly.</p><p>Sunü nodded, her voice tinged with weakness and grievance.  "I was accidentally injured in the first stage. I suppressed it, but just now, I was besieged by Ice Lizards, and the hidden injury was aggravated. I had to stop to heal."</p><p>"With Junior Sister's cultivation, passing the puppet battle shouldn't be difficult! I understand... it's because Master and the others have been too protective of you!  The puppet beasts in the final stage of the puppet battle are indeed difficult to deal with.  You're too focused on cultivation, and although your cultivation has improved rapidly and is unparalleled, you haven't experienced enough trials. You have too few practical combat opportunities.  When facing a strong enemy, you don't know how to respond and become flustered..."</p><p>The handsome young man clapped his hand, thinking he had found the crux of the problem. "After we leave the Seven Kills Hall, Junior Sister, you should ask Master and the others to let you go out and train.  I will accompany you and protect you," he advised.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother."</p><p>Sunü curtsied, put away her meditation mat, and said, "With Senior Brother here, I'm relieved.  Let's go quickly before the Soul Cleansing Liquid is taken by someone else. The other Senior Brothers should catch up eventually."</p><p>"Okay!"</p><p>The young man, unsuspecting, flashed to Sunü's side.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as the young man approached, the smile on Sunü's face vanished abruptly.  She looked at the young man coldly and suddenly struck him fiercely with her palm.</p><p>A black palm print formed by demonic energy went straight for the young man's vital points.</p><p>"Junior Sister, you..."</p><p>The young man was shocked.</p><p>He never expected that this pure and innocent girl, who in his eyes was exceptionally simple and naive, would suddenly attack him.</p><p>The two were too close. Caught off guard, the young man only had time to dodge sideways.</p><p>As soon as he moved, the young man felt something was wrong. He thought to himself, 'This is bad.'</p><p>Jade bracelets suddenly appeared from within the ice.</p><p>Observing their distribution, they formed a spirit array, and the young man's foot had just stepped into the array's range.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The ice layer exploded completely, countless ice fragments flying everywhere.</p><p>'Ding-a-ling-ling...'</p><p>The jade bracelets trembled, like bells, emitting a clear ringing sound.</p><p>But to the young man, this sound was like a death knell. He hurriedly summoned his natal magic treasure, a silver chain.</p><p>The young man named it the Immortal Binding Chain.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as the chain appeared,</p><p>A gust of wind suddenly struck.</p><p>The young man only caught a glimpse of a black light flashing in his peripheral vision. Then, he was horrified to discover that there seemed to be a barrier between him and his natal magic treasure. The connection suddenly became sluggish.</p><p>On the silver chain, there was now a small black snake formed from demonic energy.</p><p>The snake's tail was held in Sunü's left hand.</p><p>Her other hand quickly formed seals, then her red lips parted slightly, and she softly said, "Explode!"</p><p>The jade bracelets trembled even more violently, suddenly rushing towards the young man, exploding in his terrified gaze.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The spirit array self-destructed, everything around it was blown to smithereens.</p><p>Sunü retreated, avoiding the aftershock, then cautiously glanced into the distance.  After confirming that there were no other figures, she flashed back to the center of the explosion.</p><p>There was no more sound inside, the young man seemed to have been killed by the explosion.</p><p>"No need to pretend, I know you're not dead."</p><p>Sunü said disdainfully, demonic energy surging in her palm, transforming into a demonic blade, which she slashed out swiftly.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The blade was blocked.</p><p>The young man reappeared, his hair disheveled, his appearance drastically different from before.  He was holding only a fragment of his natal magic treasure, and his aura was very weak.</p><p>He stared at Sunü's pretty face, his eyes filled with deep hatred.  "Vicious woman!  I have no grievances with you, why did you set a trap to harm me!"</p><p>"Vicious woman? No grievances?"</p><p>Sunü sneered without answering, attacking again.</p><p>The seriously injured young man was naturally no match for Sunü, and in the end, he was captured alive.</p><p>Sunü threw the young man onto the ice, her eyes complex. "Senior Brother, for the sake of our decades of close companionship, if you honestly answer one question, I'll give you a quick death and spare you the pain of soul searching."</p><p>The young man remained silent, only staring at her with hateful eyes.</p><p>Sunü, as if she didn't see it, asked, "Were you sent by the Alliance Leader and your master, that old ghost Xun, to monitor me? What is their purpose in taking me in?"</p><p>Hearing this, the young man's expression changed, shock flashing in his eyes.</p><p>"As I thought!"</p><p>Sunü sighed slightly. "Are you wondering how I figured it out?  Yue Xiangu set me up, pretending that I was accidentally discovered by the Alliance Leader and taken in as a disciple because of my outstanding talent. In reality, she offered me as a gift to the Alliance Leader.  She thought I had lost all my memories, but I remember everything!"</p><p>At this point, deep-seated hatred appeared on Sunü's face.  "She used us, dozens of sisters, as sacrifices, using evil methods to refine the so-called Five Yin Exquisite Body. In the end, only I managed to survive! Yue Xiangu succeeded, she offered me up, and now she should have achieved her goal, right?  For these past decades, I've pretended to be ignorant and naive, letting you manipulate me, but I'm getting more and more afraid! Even with the Five Yin Exquisite Body, my cultivation shouldn't be improving this fast. What do you want to do to me that you're willing to cultivate me at all costs? You came here ostensibly to meet up with me, but in reality, you were monitoring me, right? There are people from the Alliance guarding the entrance to the inner hall, aren't there?"</p><p>Sunü stared intently into the young man's eyes, her voice shrill, demanding answers.</p><p>"Junior Sister, you're overthinking it.  You gained the Alliance Leader's attention simply because of your outstanding talent. For the past few decades, Master and the Alliance Leader have often guided your cultivation. How have they ever mistreated you?"</p><p>The young man sighed and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>Seeing the young man's stubbornness, Sunü didn't hesitate. She pressed her palm against his forehead.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>The young man died.</p><p>"As I thought, he was deliberately approaching me under the instructions of that old ghost, it's a pity he knew too little.  Did you think I would let you manipulate me?"</p><p>Sunü snorted coldly, looking down at the young man's corpse.  After a moment of hesitation, she conjured a flame, incinerating the body to ashes.</p><p>She took out a token and waved her hand, wanting to destroy it.</p><p>However, the token was incredibly hard and linked to her bloodline, preventing her from discarding it.</p>
