<h1>Chapter 502: A Meal</h1><p>The next morning, after watching the sunrise, Qin Sang returned to his cave. He collected the treasures he had left there and resealed the cave entrance, leaving the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid to grow undisturbed.</p><p>Passing by the small island, he didn't see Cloud Wanderer or Li Yufu. He left a message talisman, arranging to meet Cloud Wanderer there in a month.  Cloud Wanderer's movements were unpredictable, so they had agreed to use the island as a contact point, and Qin Sang tried to allow ample time between meetings.</p><p>Qin Sang then returned to the Earth Sinkhole and summoned the Night Devil from within the Earthly Yin energy.</p><p>The Earthly Yin energy churned.</p><p>A shadowy figure, seemingly born from the underworld, slowly materialized from the swirling energy.  Even upon seeing its master, its face remained expressionless.</p><p>It had been almost a year since Qin Sang had placed the Night Devil in the Earth Sinkhole to recover, having been preoccupied with preparing for his Core Formation.</p><p>From the outside, the wound on the Night Devil's dantian had closed, and the external injuries had completely healed.  Its body was no longer as withered as it had been immediately after the injury, and it seemed to be in good condition.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang probed the Night Devil's energy sea with his divine sense, he was disappointed to find that the Night Devil's Corpse Core was still covered in cracks and dim.</p><p>It looked almost the same as it had a year ago.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, carefully examining the Night Devil's Core. He realized that there had been improvement, albeit slow and imperceptible without close scrutiny.</p><p>The signs of improvement indicated that the healing method was correct.</p><p>But the recovery was far too slow!</p><p>"Three years..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his brow furrowed.</p><p>The Violet Firmament Palace would open in three years.</p><p>If he failed to form his Core, the Night Devil would be his greatest reliance in the face of danger, and he would have to bring it with him no matter what.</p><p>"It might not be impossible..."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized he had been thinking about it the wrong way.</p><p>The Night Devil's slow recovery in the first year was due to the severity of its injuries. The initial stage was bound to be the most difficult, and the rate of recovery should accelerate later.</p><p>Moreover, once the Night Devil's injuries had healed halfway, he wouldn't risk damaging its Corpse Core by trying to control it. He could then attempt to control the Night Devil, making it devour the Earthly Yin energy faster, which might aid its recovery.</p><p>However, this would mean his own plans would lose the Night Devil's assistance.</p><p>After his examination, Qin Sang returned the Night Devil to the Earth Sinkhole.</p><p>...</p><p>Returning Dragon Monastery.</p><p>Soaring Dragon Mountain.</p><p>The mist clinging to the mountainside had persisted for a century, preventing ordinary people from ascending and fostering the belief that it was a sacred place.</p><p>It was widely believed that the mountain was the abode of immortals, a reputation it held for hundreds of miles around. Over the past century, its fame had spread not only throughout the Ancient Abyss Kingdom but also to neighboring lands.</p><p>Seekers of immortality flocked to the mountain.</p><p>Over the past century, the village at the foot of the mountain had grown into a town, which eventually became too small to accommodate the influx of seekers. The ruler of the Ancient Abyss Kingdom then ordered the construction of a city below Soaring Dragon Mountain.</p><p>Over time, a small city rose from the ground.</p><p>The ruler personally gave it a name that resonated with the people:  Destiny City.</p><p>Due to its location near the capital of the Ancient Abyss Kingdom and not in a strategically important area, the sudden appearance of a fortified city often intrigued newly arrived merchants.</p><p>#(Red envelope event)# Follow the VX public account [Book Friends Base Camp] to read popular novels and win cash prizes!</p><p>Although no one had ever encountered an immortal on the mountain, countless legends, constantly embellished, emanated from Destiny City.</p><p>One year, Zhang San was chosen by an immortal master and taken up the mountain; the next year, Li Si, due to his handsome appearance, became the consort of an immortal maiden; there were also stories of Daoist children, herb gatherers, alchemists' assistants...</p><p>Countless stories, each more fantastical than the last.</p><p>Twisting and turning, captivating and enthralling.</p><p>They filled people with yearning, wishing they could trade places with the protagonists.</p><p>In previous years, only commoners and seekers of immortality would kneel at the foot of the mountain during festivals, praying for the blessings of the immortals.</p><p>Five years ago, the Ancient Abyss Kingdom suddenly designated Soaring Dragon Mountain as a sacred mountain and erected an altar there. Every winter solstice, the ruler, despite his advanced age, would personally climb the mountain to burn incense and preside over the Heaven Worship Ceremony.</p><p>After the ceremony, the ruler would dismiss his attendants and remain alone at the altar for an hour.</p><p>Each time, he would descend the mountain with a look of disappointment.</p><p>This year, just after the winter solstice, unusually, it was the Crown Prince who presided over the Heaven Worship Ceremony.  That very night, snow began to fall, and the temperature plummeted.</p><p>The land was covered in a blanket of white.</p><p>The following morning.</p><p>The residents of Destiny City rose early to clear the snow from their doorsteps, while children played in the snowdrifts.  There were fewer merchants entering the city today, and the streets were sparsely populated, with only the charcoal seller calling out his wares.</p><p>Destiny City was located directly west of Soaring Dragon Mountain, its main street aligned with the mountain, running east-west. The west end connected to the city's west gate, from which a straight stone road led directly to the capital.</p><p>At this moment, a young Daoist walked along the main street from the east.</p><p>He wore a clean but worn Daoist robe.  The snow had stopped, and the sun was shining, melting some of the snow on the streets.  His leg wrappings were speckled with mud, but this didn't detract from his presence.</p><p>He looked young, only about twenty years old, but he possessed an undeniable aura.</p><p>This was Qin Sang.</p><p>He had returned to Soaring Dragon Mountain and checked all the message talismans in Returning Dragon Monastery. Finding nothing urgent, he recalled Qi Yuanhu's suggestion and entered the city, changing into ordinary Daoist robes and disguising himself as a wandering Daoist.</p><p>He walked through the slush without using his spiritual power, unconcerned about the dirt on his clothes, strolling aimlessly, looking left and right, unsure of what he was searching for.</p><p>He realized that his timing for descending the mountain was poor.</p><p>In the depths of winter, few commoners ventured outside, and the streets were deserted.  He wanted to observe the world, but there were few people to observe.</p><p>"Young Daoist..."</p><p>Qin Sang strode down the main street, pondering whether he should go to the capital, where there would likely be more people.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a call.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. He was the only Daoist on the street.  Following the sound, he saw a courtyard with its gate ajar. An old woman stood at the entrance, beckoning to him.</p><p>The old woman was bundled in a worn cloth jacket, layered with patches, but it was neat and clean.</p><p>Her face was wrinkled, and she appeared to be over seventy. However, with Qin Sang's discerning eyes, he could tell that her true age was younger. Hardship had aged her prematurely.</p><p>"Young Daoist, are you also seeking the immortals?"</p><p>The old woman took a step forward, but her foot slipped.  She steadied herself against the wall, still warmly inviting Qin Sang, "Coming down the mountain so early, it must be freezing up there.  Who would have thought the snow would come so early this year!  Haven't eaten yet, have you? I just finished cooking. Come in and have something to eat, warm yourself up."</p><p>Qin Sang, unsure of where to go, had a change of heart. He nodded and walked over, bowing slightly. "Thank you, kind lady.  I am indeed hungry.  I will gratefully accept your offer."</p>
