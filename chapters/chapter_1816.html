<h1>Chapter 1807: The Change in the Numinous Wasteland</h1><p>Outside Realized Sword Master's cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, placing the Chengying Sword on his knees.  Stroking the sword's body, he followed Realized Sword Master's instructions, sensing the seal.</p><p>While Realized Sword Master was in seclusion for his breakthrough, Qin Sang acted as his protector. The Sword Slave activated the island's protective formation, guarding the entrance to the spirit island.</p><p>The grass and trees withered, and autumn arrived once more.</p><p>The door to the cave dwelling opened, and Realized Sword Master stepped out. Qin Sang, who had long since risen and was waiting respectfully, said, "Congratulations, Dao Brother!"</p><p>In just half a year, Realized Sword Master had successfully broken through to the middle stage of Deity Transformation, much faster than Qin Sang had anticipated!</p><p>"Many thanks, Brother, for protecting me."</p><p>Realized Sword Master smiled, his gaze falling upon the sword in Qin Sang's hand. "How is your progress?"</p><p>"I have a clue," Qin Sang replied confidently.</p><p>Most inherited swords were forged for future descendants and possessed unique seals requiring specific methods to unlock.</p><p>Without knowing the unlocking method, he could only follow Realized Sword Master's advice, painstakingly experimenting bit by bit.</p><p>Fortunately, as Qin Sang had expected, the Chengying Sword's seal, eroded by time, was no longer as potent as it once was.  He should be able to break the seal soon.</p><p>"Dao Brother has just had a breakthrough and must have many matters to attend to.  I shall not disturb you further.  I will celebrate with you another day," Qin Sang said, bowing slightly before turning and walking toward his own cave dwelling.</p><p>Realized Sword Master watched Qin Sang depart, pondered for a moment, then summoned the Sword Slave, instructing him to bring the talismans and letters that had arrived on the island during this period.</p><p>…</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sealed the formation restrictions. The Chengying Sword flew from his hand and hovered before him.</p><p>His mind entered the sword's body, and a thoughtful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Several days later, he suddenly moved, consecutively performing several hand seals, striking them into the Chengying Sword from afar.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A clear sword cry echoed. The Chengying Sword abruptly released a dazzling sword light that illuminated the entire cave dwelling.</p><p>But the light vanished in a flash, and the spirit sword returned to stillness.</p><p>A joyful glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.  Raising his hand, he transformed into a stream of light that enveloped the sword's body. Hand seals continuously flashed, the light changing and shifting.</p><p>A moment later, the Chengying Sword began to vibrate frequently, until finally, a crisp sound like shattering porcelain emanated from the sword's body.  A tremendously sharp sword energy erupted within the cave dwelling, threatening to pierce the formation restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  True Essence surged before him, practically forming a True Essence vortex in the void.</p><p>The light dissipated, and the vortex was empty.</p><p>Even the sword's shadow was gone.</p><p>But Qin Sang could clearly perceive the powerful sword intent and the formless sword that carried it.</p><p>Or perhaps, the Chengying Sword itself was formed from this sword intent.</p><p>The instant Qin Sang's mind entered the Chengying Sword, he felt himself pulled into a strange space.</p><p>In a trance, he seemed to see a person.</p><p>This person stood with their back to him, atop a cloud-wreathed mountain peak, holding a sword in one hand, and slashing forward.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword went forth.</p><p>There were no surging clouds, no collapsing mountains, nor any rivers flowing in reverse.</p><p>It was an ordinary sword strike, yet it stirred Qin Sang's mind profoundly. He abruptly withdrew from the sword, his breath slightly ragged, a look of shock on his face.</p><p>That single strike was the inheritance of sword intent!</p><p>The Chengying Sword contained no cultivation method, no written words, not even a clear view of the senior's appearance. There was only pure sword intent.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang understood that the senior who had refined this sword intent inheritance also cultivated the Dao of the Killing Sword!</p><p>However, Qin Sang also sensed a significant difference between this person's Dao and the *Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter*.</p><p>Even within the Dao of the Killing Sword, there were multiple emphases and branches, not to be confused.</p><p>The Dao of the *Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter*, which was also the Dao Qin Sang sought, emphasized 'killing,' comprehending the sword through slaughter.</p><p>The person within the sword emphasized the sword itself; the sword controlled the Killing Dao. In the eyes of a sword cultivator, this might be the true and proper path.</p><p>The cultivation process of the *Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter* revealed that its creator gained new insights into the Killing Dao with each breakthrough, experiencing a transformation.</p><p>The changes in swordsmanship were less pronounced than those in the Killing Dao. Even upon reaching the Deity Transformation realm, there was still only the Seven Soul Killing Formation, ultimately derived from the continuous evolution of the seven Killing Talismans.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang understood that the owner of the Chengying Sword and the creator of the *Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter* might have had a connection, but their Daos were not the same.</p><p>He needed to follow the path of the *Divine Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter*.  The sword intent within the Chengying Sword could not directly enhance his own Dao.</p><p>However, accepting the Chengying Sword's sword intent would still greatly benefit him, at the very least significantly improving his swordsmanship.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's impatience subsided. After pondering for a moment, he flickered his brow and summoned the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword spiraled and danced, its body translucent, its spirit already quite apparent, transforming towards a nascent spirit.</p><p>After repeatedly consulting Master Qi and Master Gu, Qin Sang continuously improved his sword refinement method, with gratifying results.</p><p>With a thought, the Cloud Wanderer Sword hovered beside the Chengying Sword.</p><p>The Chengying Sword was formless; only the Cloud Wanderer Sword was visible. Qin Sang intended to try refining the Chengying Sword using the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>After breaking the seal, Qin Sang had a clearer understanding of the Chengying Sword.</p><p>As an inherited sword, the Chengying Sword was meticulously condensed from sword intent by that senior.  It was not only a formless sword but could be said to be not a sword at all, but a pure and extremely refined sword intent.</p><p>As the sword intent was refined, it would merge with the Qi of the refiner's spirit sword, transforming into the spirit sword's sword shadow.</p><p>Simply put, the Chengying Sword might only attach itself to the Cloud Wanderer Sword rather than merging with it.</p><p>After all, tempering one's own spirit sword was also part of a sword cultivator's practice. The purpose of an inherited sword was to provide guidance and rapidly enhance the inheritor's strength.  Tempering the spirit sword still relied on oneself.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang believed the Chengying Sword might not affect the Cloud Wanderer Sword's nascent spirit formation.</p><p>These were merely speculations.  If it proved impossible, Qin Sang would have to wait until the Cloud Wanderer Sword's nascent spirit was born before refining the Chengying Sword, or he would have to use another sword.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword was connected to his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang urged the Cloud Wanderer Sword, generating sword light that enveloped the Chengying Sword, carefully probing.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>The tension on Qin Sang's face gradually disappeared, replaced by relaxation.  The facts proved that refining the Chengying Sword would not disrupt the Cloud Wanderer Sword's nascent spirit.  He could proceed with confidence.</p><p>However, after a while, Qin Sang still withdrew both swords, pausing the refinement process.</p><p>Since refining the Chengying Sword was not particularly helpful to his cultivation, Qin Sang was not in a hurry.  He still prioritized cultivation, placing the refinement of the Chengying Sword after comprehending the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal*.</p><p>Despite the short duration of his study, Qin Sang had benefited immensely.</p><p>A sword light leaped from the Thousand鈞 Ring.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword appeared, and the scenery within the cave dwelling instantly transformed, as if the starry sky had been drawn into the sword.</p><p>Gazing at the Seven Constellations Domain Sword Formation, a contemplative look appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Before this, he knew he hadn't fully grasped the Seven Constellations Domain Sword Formation. Whenever he had time, he would contemplate it.</p><p>Obtaining the sword intent inheritance not only greatly increased his swordsmanship but also broadened his horizons.</p><p>"Perhaps, the completion of the Seven Constellations Domain Sword Formation is not far off.  I can devote more time to this for now…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he thought to himself.</p><p>…</p><p>News of Realized Sword Master's breakthrough spread, and Realized Youhuang and others came to offer their congratulations.</p><p>Qin Sang also emerged from seclusion during this time, occasionally visiting Pot City, but he frequently consulted Realized Sword Master on swordsmanship.</p><p>Sensing Realized Sword Master's sincere guidance, Qin Sang benefited greatly and felt grateful.</p><p>During this period, Master Lingxu sent someone to deliver a bottle of Clear Flower Pills. Qin Sang gave one to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly at regular intervals.</p><p>Both man and butterfly were rapidly improving.</p><p>One day.</p><p>A streak of light flew to the waters above Sword Heart Island.</p><p>The newcomer was a fair-skinned young man.  He circled the nearby waters for a while, finally locating Sword Heart Island. Overjoyed, he increased his speed and flew towards it.</p><p>"Who goes there?"</p><p>A shout came from ahead as he approached within ten miles of Sword Heart Island, accompanied by a powerful oppressive aura.</p><p>The young man's face paled, and he hurriedly stopped.  "This junior has been sent by his master, Mountain Man Boh Xian, to deliver a letter to Senior Qingfeng."</p><p>"Oh? Bring the letter here, and this old man will pass it on to Senior Qingfeng," an old man in black robes appeared ahead.</p><p>The young man dared not ask further questions. He handed over the letter and waited respectfully outside the island.</p><p>Inside his cave dwelling, Qin Sang, alerted by the Sword Slave's report, awakened from his meditative state and murmured, "I didn't expect to wait ten years.  Grand Sovereign Qingdan has prepared for so long and is finally setting off."</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the letter landed in his palm.</p><p>After reading it, Qin Sang said in a deep voice, "Tell Fellow Daoist Boh Xian that I will definitely meet him in ten days."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The Sword Slave took his leave.</p><p>A thoughtful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Ten years later, Qin Sang was no longer as interested in the Venomous Domain as he once was.</p><p>Before agreeing to Grand Sovereign Qingdan, he didn't know the origins of the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal* or the details of the Chengying Sword.</p><p>Mastering these was enough to guarantee his combat prowess.</p><p>Adding the Venomous Dao seemed like biting off more than he could chew.  In fact, Qin Sang already felt stretched thin.</p><p>Going to the Venomous Domain was just to find a way.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang also wanted to verify whether his understanding of the cultivation methods was correct.</p><p>He had already decided to venture deep into the Numinous Wasteland and challenge a single Demonic Beast above the middle stage of Deity Transformation.</p><p>Countless ferocious beasts roamed the Numinous Wasteland. If they could help him comprehend the Killing Dao, he wouldn't lack opponents in the future.</p><p>If the effect was poor, his understanding might be flawed.</p><p>"Conclude this matter quickly and enter closed-door cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, slowly closing his eyes and circulating his profound arts.</p><p>…</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Without alerting Realized Sword Master, Qin Sang informed the Sword Slave and flew northwestward on his sword.</p><p>Soon, he arrived above a stretch of reefs and islets.</p><p>The islets here were small and appeared desolate, devoid of human life.</p><p>"Realized Qingfeng is truly a man of his word.  Please come quickly."</p><p>A figure flew out from a small island. It was Realized Boh Xian, who greeted Qin Sang with a relieved smile.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly and landed on the island alongside Realized Boh Xian.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Realized Boh Xian revealed an immortal abode: "This is one of this humble Daoist's cultivation retreats…"</p><p>As they spoke, the two entered the immortal abode and met Grand Sovereign Qingdan.</p><p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they got down to business.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Grand Sovereign Qingdan and asked, "Why don't I see Realized Yunwei?"</p><p>Grand Sovereign Qingdan shook her head.  "Our sect suffered heavy losses last time, and the remaining disciples are insufficient to deploy the formation.  Over these ten years, Fellow Daoist Boh Xian and I tried to improve the formation, but to no avail. Yunwei and the others, without the formation's protection, would only be a burden.  Only the three of us will go this time!"</p><p>Realized Boh Xian interjected, "Realized Qingfeng must have made some preparations as well, right?"</p><p>"I have done my best."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He had consulted Master Lingxu about antidote pills and discovered that highly potent pills were extremely valuable.  Even Master Lingxu couldn't easily refine them.</p><p>And pills with weaker potency were inferior to Fat Silkworm's poison pills.</p><p>Grand Sovereign Qingdan nodded. "I have collected some additional poison-warding treasures.  With the three of us working together, entering the depths of the Venomous Domain will be no problem. We will still prioritize caution this time. If it doesn't work, we will try again next time."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>He truly didn't want to waste too much of their time.</p><p>Moreover, various signs indicated that the Numinous Wasteland was not peaceful. The Demonic God worship was rampant.</p><p>The Ghostfang Kingdom and the Dao Court were scheming something. Beneath the calm surface, a volcano was brewing.</p><p>In such a situation, frequent travel between the two regions was unwise.</p><p>"Have you two Fellow Daoists heard anything? How does the Dao Court plan to deal with the Demonic God?" Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>Grand Sovereign Qingdan was taken aback and said sheepishly, "This humble Daoist has been focused on the Venomous Domain and has neglected to stay informed about the situation…"</p><p>Sects like Mole Cricket Mountain were accustomed to the Dao Court's presence. The threat of demons and devils was the Dao Court's responsibility.</p><p>They only needed to wait for the Dao Court's decree, dispatch disciples to the battlefield, and repel the demonic forces.</p><p>Countless years of history proved that the Dao Court was relatively just.</p><p>Mountain Man Boh Xian scoffed. "Have you two forgotten about those Earthly Gods? The highest-ranking Mountain Lord only holds the Dharma Rank of Ascendant Profound. What kind of god are they?  They are just dogs guarding the house for the Dao Court! What kind of waves can the Ghostfang Kingdom's demons and devils create by trying to follow that path?"</p><p>Qin Sang disagreed with Mountain Man Boh Xian's assessment but didn't say anything.</p><p>Grand Sovereign Qingdan said, "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist.  I have inquired.  Neither the Dao Court nor the Ghostfang Kingdom has sent anyone into the Jushan Governance Altar.  At least within the altar, we are safe. If there is a next time, I will definitely investigate thoroughly."</p><p>Next, the three discussed their upcoming journey.</p><p>They had all made preparations before their meeting.  Without further delay, they departed from the island that same day, flying directly north, arriving at the border of Star Island's Immortal Lake.</p><p>No one was competing with them for the Venomous Domain, so there was no need to rush, unlike last time.</p><p>The three concealed their auras, employing concealment techniques as they landed and proceeded slowly on foot, so as not to disturb the ferocious beasts.</p><p>They were not afraid of the beasts, but they needed to be wary of the Ghostfang Kingdom's demons and devils.</p><p>Half a month later.</p><p>The three stood on a mountaintop, gazing at a mountain valley ahead, their expressions serious.</p><p>"It's a Demonic Temple. The rumors are true. The demonic influence has almost reached the heartland of the Dao Court," Mountain Man Boh Xian said gravely.</p><p>It was said that even in the distant Middle Luxuriant Governance and White Stone Governance, the shadow of the Demonic God had appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the Serpent Demon he had subdued years ago.</p><p>Could the inheritance the Serpent Demon received be a hidden hand left by the Ghostfang Kingdom, blooming everywhere, forcing the Dao Court to fight on multiple fronts?</p><p>The Dao Court had not yet launched a large-scale campaign to destroy demonic temples and purge the demonic atmosphere.  The demons and devils would surely become even more rampant in the future.</p><p>"Let's go around."</p><p>Grand Sovereign Qingdan said in a deep voice.</p><p>The three took one last look at the crude temple in the mountain valley and the kneeling ghost citizens before quietly bypassing the area.</p><p>Along the way, they were forced to detour many times, avoiding combat as much as possible. Finally, they safely returned to the Jushan Governance Altar.</p><p>The auspicious clouds enveloping the altar had stabilized, the fluctuations no longer spilling outwards. The ferocious beasts had returned to the plains before the auspicious clouds, a lively scene.</p><p>Out of caution, the three lingered nearby for several days, scouting the area, then crossed the plains as quickly as possible, entering the Jushan Governance Altar.</p>
