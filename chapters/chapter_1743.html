<h1>Chapter 1734: The Taiyi Star Carriage</h1><p>Following this sentence was a large section of text, recording Bao Gu's situation at that time.  The general meaning was that the Cang Lang Sea and the Demon Sea were protected by an invisible barrier, but also isolated from the outside world.  They did not know which world lay beyond. Bao Gu, upon leaving the Cang Lang Sea, might travel to the Middle Continent and learn about Mount Daiyu and the ascension paths pioneered by past cultivators, but she was unaware of these before her departure.</p><p>……</p><p>Upon reading this, Qin Sang withdrew his focus and inquired of Bao Zhengnan whether anyone in the Cang Lang Sea had discovered traces of Bao Gu since then. He received a negative response.  Bao Gu cared deeply for the world.  If she had discovered the secrets of ascension in the Middle Continent, she would have certainly relayed them back to the Cang Lang Sea, but she had not returned. From this, it could be deduced that the one-way restriction of the invisible barrier was not only meant to block outsiders but was equally effective on native cultivators.  Before her departure, Bao Gu might have had a premonition, which is why she made such arrangements.</p><p>Qin Sang continued reading.</p><p>It turned out that the Wu Clan had long-held legends passed down through generations.  Spirit Severing cultivators, attuned to Heaven and Earth, could sense the Gate of Ascension and ascend through it. However, the path was arduous and required utmost caution.</p><p>Furthermore, the legends of the Wu Clan mentioned the name of the Returning Ruins!</p><p>From this, it was evident that the Returning Ruins existed in ancient times, but it was unclear whether ferocious beasts roamed there then.</p><p>What followed were the arrangements Bao Gu made before her departure.</p><p>After reading them, Qin Sang was both astonished and delighted, and felt deep admiration for this predecessor from millennia past.</p><p>The Four Saints of the Cang Lang Sea truly lived up to their title of 'Saint'!</p><p>Bao Gu, having reached the Spirit Severing realm and capable of ascension, did not think of her own individual transcendence but sought a path for her people.</p><p>Bao Gu referred to the invisible barrier as a boundary.  To find a way out, the first step would be to break through this boundary and find a method to connect the inside and the outside.  It needed to allow both exit and entry.</p><p>Unfortunately, fate was fickle. While experimenting with various secret techniques and treasures, the Four Saints triggered a calamity in the Seven Kills Hall, nearly releasing the Demon Lord. Three of the Four Saints sacrificed themselves to seal the demon.</p><p>Although Bao Gu survived, she was gravely injured.</p><p>Most terrifyingly, to complete the demon-sealing formation, Bao Gu was forced to overdraw her own vital essence, significantly shortening her lifespan.</p><p>Even after her injuries healed, the fundamental damage could not be repaired.  Her remaining lifespan was only one or two hundred years, which, for a Spirit Severing cultivator, might be equivalent to a single closed-door cultivation session.</p><p>However, resources in the lower realm were scarce.  Neither the Cang Lang Sea, the Demon Sea, nor the Seven Kills Hall possessed any miraculous pills that could restore her lifespan. Only by ascending to the upper realm could she find a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Despite her own precarious situation, Bao Gu did not forget her original aspiration.  Alas, she was powerless. The affairs of the lower realm could only be entrusted to future generations.</p><p>After reading the jade slip's inscription, Qin Sang's gaze returned to the landscape screen, fixated on the full moon in the painting.</p><p>What Bao Gu left for posterity was a secret treasure, called the Taiyi Star Carriage!</p><p>This treasure was a celestial flying carriage obtained by the Four Saints from the Seven Kills Hall.  A cultivator riding the Taiyi Star Carriage would have the hope of traversing the outer boundary, entering and exiting freely.</p><p>Now, the invisible barrier had vanished, but in Qin Sang's eyes, the Taiyi Star Carriage's value had not diminished but increased!</p><p>The Taiyi Star Carriage was a damaged treasure. The Four Saints had racked their brains to repair it, but unfortunately, they were unable to fix it before the calamity struck, forcing Bao Gu to ascend.</p><p>Because it was damaged, it was difficult to say how powerful the Taiyi Star Carriage originally was.</p><p>The Four Saints speculated that riding the Taiyi Star Carriage would be like being in the Lunar Palace of the Vast Cold Heavens, surrounded by starlight and moonlight, riding the moon across the celestial dome, flickering in and out of sight, ethereal and untraceable.</p><p>The carriage's flight speed might not be exceptionally fast, but it likely possessed concealment and protective abilities!</p><p>Because of this, Bao Gu left another instruction: regardless of whether her ascension succeeded or failed, she would do her best to leave a special marker in the Returning Ruins. This marker would resonate with the restrictions on the Taiyi Star Carriage. If future generations could repair the Taiyi Star Carriage, they could use it to infiltrate the Returning Ruins and search for her.</p><p>With the aid of this treasure, finding the Gate of Ascension would become much easier.</p><p>This full moon on the landscape screen was the Taiyi Star Carriage!</p><p>Qin Sang closed the jade slip and sighed, involuntarily recalling those predecessors who had paved the path of ascension for this realm.  Bao Gu was their epitome. They ventured into the Returning Ruins, and even if they perished, they would strive to leave something behind to guide those who came after.</p><p>“I wonder if Senior Bao Gu ever visited the Middle Continent, if she knew about Mount Daiyu…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>However, considering Bao Gu's dwindling lifespan at the time, even in the vast world, miraculous medicines that could replenish her vital essence were unlikely to be readily available. Bao Gu probably didn't have the time to travel in this realm.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and the other two silently watched the jade slip in Qin Sang's hand, extremely curious about its contents. But since Qin Sang held onto it, they couldn't very well ask for it.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang snapped back to reality and handed the jade slip to Bao Zhengnan. He walked directly to the landscape screen and extended his right hand, gently touching the screen.</p><p>The screen's texture was soft, like silk yet not silk, like gauze yet not gauze, with a warm and smooth feel.  It was also a treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang's palm covered the full moon.  Applying slight pressure, his hand sank entirely into the painting, with only his wrist remaining outside. As he withdrew his hand, it cradled a bright moon.</p><p>Looking at the landscape screen again, the painting, now devoid of the moon, had lost all its artistic conception!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed as he examined the Taiyi Star Carriage in his hand.</p><p>A clear, bright light flowed like water, gently brushing over his fingers, sparkling and shining as if he had truly plucked the moon from the sky.</p><p>At the center of the moon, a palanquin, carved from mutton-fat jade, was faintly visible.</p><p>Calling it a palanquin wasn't entirely accurate; it resembled a refined and magnificent divine palace. Unfortunately, it was covered in cracks and damage, marring the treasure's ethereal beauty.</p><p>This was the true form of the Taiyi Star Carriage. While it appeared small and exquisite, it possessed otherworldly properties when activated.</p><p>The light fluctuated, causing the Taiyi Star Carriage to flicker in and out of existence, as if it could shift between reality and illusion.</p><p>Even without using divine sense, it was clear to the naked eye that the treasure was severely damaged.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the damaged areas, recalling the contents of Bao Gu's inscription.  The Four Saints had failed to repair it, but they had left behind a wealth of valuable experience.</p><p>However, according to Bao Gu, completely restoring this treasure was practically impossible. They could only strive to mend it, restoring a portion of its power, enough to make it usable.</p><p>By now, the Bao siblings and Zhuo Ming also knew the contents of their ancestor's inscription.  Looking at the Taiyi Star Carriage in Qin Sang's hand, although they had anticipated it, they couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p><p>There was only this single supreme treasure within their ancestor's legacy, and it wasn't a miraculous pill capable of aiding breakthroughs.</p><p>More importantly, their ancestor clearly stated that repairing the Taiyi Star Carriage required at least Spirit Severing cultivation. Even if it were fully repaired, a Nascent Soul cultivator would find it extremely taxing to control, perhaps even impossible to command.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, can you repair this treasure?”</p><p>Bao Zhengnan inquired.</p><p>Although Bao Gu left behind her insights, they hadn't been able to deduce a reliable repair method back then. They had left behind a few conjectures, which required Qin Sang to verify one by one.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned contemplative. After pondering for a while, he said, “I have some skill in the Dao of Artifact Refinement, but this treasure is exceptionally profound. It will require some time to comprehend and gradually verify the repair methods Senior Bao Gu theorized. The Middle Continent has numerous Spirit Severing sects and countless talented individuals, as well as many spiritual materials and rare treasures not found in the outer realms. I plan to bring this treasure back to the Middle Continent. The chances of repairing it there are greater. What are your thoughts?”</p><p>The three exchanged glances.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan bowed and said, “Our ancestor stated that this treasure should be gifted to the Spirit Severing descendant who opened the cave dwelling. Moreover, Fellow Daoist Qin has toiled tirelessly, also seeking a path for the cultivators of this realm, which aligns with our ancestor’s will. It rightfully belongs to you.”</p><p>Qin Sang did not refuse, nor could he.</p><p>He reiterated his previous promise:  “Regardless of any future developments, I will not forget the Cang Lang Sea.”</p><p>“We are grateful to Fellow Daoist Qin for paving the way for us!”</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and the others, their expressions solemn, bowed deeply to Qin Sang.</p><p>The chairs and meditation mats within the cave dwelling were ordinary objects. The landscape screen was specifically refined by Bao Gu to store and nurture the Taiyi Star Carriage.</p><p>Qin Sang took the landscape screen as well and returned to the quiet chamber arranged for him by the Four Saints Palace. Bao Zhengnan and the others remained behind, setting up various restrictions within Bao Gu's cave dwelling. From now on, this place would be a sacred ground for the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>Closing the door to the quiet chamber, Qin Sang took out the Taiyi Star Carriage and held it in his hand, scrutinizing it carefully, his eyes sparkling with fascination.</p><p>With his expertise in the Dao of Artifact Refinement, he could naturally discern the great difficulty of repairing this treasure. It was not a task that could be accomplished overnight.</p><p>However, he could still afford to wait!</p><p>Achieving Spirit Severing before the age of eight hundred was rare throughout history. Neither lifespan nor heavenly tribulation posed an immediate problem.  Moreover, he had the Jade Buddha; the Demonic Sounds of the Heavenly Dao couldn't affect his mind.</p><p>If he couldn't find a second Ascension Platform, venturing eastward to the Returning Ruins might be the only option.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Carriage possessed protective and concealment abilities.  The Four Saints also speculated that it had the ability to traverse boundaries.</p><p>These abilities were crucial in the Returning Ruins.  Not only would they significantly increase his chances of survival, but they might also allow him to infiltrate the Returning Ruins and Mount Daiyu using this treasure, scout the area, and then return to make preparations, allowing him to act with a clear purpose.</p><p>Of course, the Taiyi Star Carriage was still damaged, and the extent of its power remained unknown.</p><p>Considering the Taiyi Star Carriage's origins, Qin Sang was confident in it.  It all depended on how well he could repair this treasure.</p><p>Having unexpectedly obtained this extraordinary treasure, Qin Sang felt elated and immersed himself in its study.  He remained in the quiet chamber for an entire month without emerging.  The maidservants dared not disturb him and could only wait outside. Even Bao Zhengnan hadn't seen him.</p><p>During this time, the Four Saints Palace was bustling with activity.  Following Qin Sang's instructions, they invited all parties to gather on Tianxing Island.</p><p>Although they invited all sects and factions, the number of individuals qualified to participate in this gathering wasn't large. Most factions sent representatives.</p><p>The Cang Lang Sea was different from other realms. Due to years of war, sects, large and small, were forced to form alliances and support each other. The strongest force was undoubtedly the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>Now, the conflict between righteous and demonic sects no longer existed, or rather, it had been overshadowed by a greater conflict.  The various alliances all deferred to the Four Saints Palace, and the human race as a whole was relatively tightly organized.</p><p>As the appointed day approached, it was time for them to depart.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan arrived at the door of the quiet chamber and activated the restriction. The restriction dissipated, and he pushed the door open, his face revealing astonishment.</p><p>He saw Qin Sang sitting cross-legged, a full moon suspended before him, his face etched with exhaustion.</p><p>“Overcome with excitement, I lost myself in my studies and almost forgot the important matter…”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly.</p><p>“There is still ample time. Fellow Daoist, do you need to rest for a few days?”</p><p>Bao Zhengnan asked with some concern, glancing curiously at the Taiyi Star Carriage.</p><p>Previously, they had sent all the sect's secret manuals related to artifact refinement into the chamber.  These inheritances naturally came from the Four Saints.  He wondered if Qin Sang had gained any insights.</p><p>“There's no need,” Qin Sang shook his head, storing the Taiyi Star Carriage.  A spiritual light circulated throughout his body, and the fatigue vanished.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Ripples stirred across a vast expanse of the sea surface, imperceptible to ordinary people.</p><p>In the next moment, four figures flew through the air, their speed neither too fast nor too slow.  It was Qin Sang and the other three.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan pointed south, saying, “From here, heading south, we will reach Tianxing Island in less than an hour.”</p><p>This timeframe, of course, was based on their flight speed.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed southward, feeling a sense of revisiting a familiar place.  Recalling something, he asked, “Have there been any news about the old friends I entrusted you to find?”</p><p>Bao Xi replied, “I instructed the palace disciples to investigate. There should be some leads by now. As long as their origins are clear, it shouldn't be difficult to track down the whereabouts of our clan's cultivators. Searching for demonic beasts is a bit more troublesome. When the demonic clans of the Demon Sea invaded, the demonic beasts of the Cang Lang Sea were beguiled by them, and there were even cases of spirit beasts turning on their masters. After repelling the Demon Sea's demonic clans, large demonic beasts have become a rare sight in the Cang Lang Sea.  The demonic beasts Fellow Daoist is looking for, did they attack you?”</p><p>Recalling Qin Sang's experiences in the Cang Lang Sea, he was either searching for the Seven Kills Hall or on his way to search for it.  The number of fellow daoists he had truly befriended could be counted on one hand.</p><p>Among the humans, besides the Wang sisters, there was a disciple, named Bai Ying'er, who, while not formally his disciple, held a student-teacher relationship with him.</p><p>Among the demonic beasts, he had been acquainted with the two-headed 曜匪 for many years and also had some connection with Yuan Zhu, who had been abandoned by the Demon Sea's demonic clans.</p><p>Having come this far, Qin Sang naturally wanted to see his old friends.</p><p>However, after nearly six hundred years, were they still alive?</p><p>Thinking of the Wang sisters, like twin lotus flowers yet with completely opposite personalities, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Their Nascent Soul formation had been so arduous; he wondered if either of them had been able to reach the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Opening his mouth to speak, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he suddenly paused, looking towards the right.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and the other two were puzzled.  After a moment, they also sensed cultivators flying swiftly in that direction. Judging by their trajectory, they were also heading towards Tianxing Island, and their auras were not weak.</p><p>“In this direction, it might be the Sect Master of the Lan Dou Sect…”</p><p>Bao Zhengnan said.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>The four slightly altered their course. After flying for a distance, they saw a hawk-like spirit beast soaring in the sky ahead.  This spirit beast had a wingspan of over ten zhang and a back as broad and flat as the ground, upon which several cultivators sat or stood.</p><p>The person in the center, with white hair and a white beard, was Bai Lu Zhenren, the current Sect Master of the Lan Dou Sect, and also a mid-Nascent Soul expert.</p><p>The two groups saw each other from afar.</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren immediately led his group down, flying towards them.</p><p>They were all acquaintances and exchanged greetings. Bai Lu Zhenren's gaze shifted to Qin Sang, the only stranger.  “Who is this fellow daoist?”</p><p>The more Bai Lu Zhenren looked, the more puzzled he became.</p><p>Qin Sang stood among the three top experts of the Four Saints Palace, his expression calm and unconstrained.  The positioning of Bao Zhengnan and the others seemed to center around him.</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren considered himself a good judge of character, but he couldn't see through this person, indicating that the other party's cultivation was no weaker than his own. He could be certain that he had never seen this person before.</p><p>“Could it be that another top expert has emerged in the world and been recruited by the Four Saints Palace?”</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren pondered inwardly.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan glanced at Qin Sang, thinking about how to introduce him.</p><p>Qin Sang took the initiative and bowed, saying, “This humble one’s surname is Qin.  Greetings, Sect Master Bai Lu.”</p><p>As he spoke, his gaze swept over those behind Bai Lu Zhenren.  Not seeing anyone cultivating the Yin Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art, he asked, puzzled, "Why is the Yin Yang lineage's First Seat not present?"</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren was slightly taken aback, then his heart leaped with joy. "Martial Brother Yang has gained new insights and is currently in closed-door cultivation at his residence.  Does Fellow Daoist know Martial Brother Yang?"</p><p>Surnamed Yang?</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred. Could it be that Martial Uncle Yang?</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
