<h1>Chapter 1524: The Storm (4k)</h1><p>Liuli, daring as she is, must have been confident.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was grave.</p><p>Shi Xue was even more anxious.</p><p>Which cultivator chooses to breakthrough except when in peak condition?</p><p>Liuli's risky move—failure is a minor concern, but if it triggers backlash, she might be unable to stabilize her cultivation, harming her foundation and leaving incurable hidden injuries.</p><p>Liuli's face showed no hesitation or worry, only intense focus.</p><p>On the wild plain,</p><p>plants were charred, craters dotted the landscape, and life was extinguished.</p><p>Only Liuli sat alone, struggling against the Dao and herself.</p><p>Her expression shifted constantly. Shi Xue thought Liuli was suffering from the forced breakthrough, but only Qin Sang knew she was enduring the fierce backlash of the demonic art's imprint.</p><p>Every second felt agonizingly long, causing intense anxiety.</p><p>Liuli's breath was erratic, waxing and waning, increasingly frequent and unstable, threatening to spiral out of control.</p><p>It seemed Liuli was about to suffer a painful defeat.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's eyes, Liuli remained steadfast, the situation gradually improving!</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The tribulation clouds had dissipated, the sky clear and bright.</p><p>Yet, a muffled thunderous sound echoed through the void.</p><p>In an instant, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged, madly rushing towards the center of the plain.  The energy, like a tide, rapidly gathered around Liuli.</p><p>At that moment, Liuli's body seemed to become a funnel, absorbing the spiritual energy like a whale swallowing water, while her breath grew stronger, breaking through the bottleneck with unstoppable momentum!</p><p>"She did it?"</p><p>Shi Xue, watching the astonishing celestial phenomenon on the plain, found it hard to believe.</p><p>Her junior sister had actually done it!</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, her admiration for Liuli evident.  "Congratulations! To breakthrough under a heavenly tribulation, few besides Liuli could achieve this."</p><p>"Congratulations to you too…"</p><p>Shi Xue grinned, genuinely happy for Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang waved, setting up several formation flags to seal off the plain, then turned and said, "Let's go back. We shouldn't disturb her. She needs time to consolidate her realm after the breakthrough."</p><p>Shi Xue reluctantly glanced at Liuli, then followed Qin Sang back to the temple.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang looked Shi Xue up and down, a thought stirring in her heart. She smiled and said, "Should I offer my congratulations in advance to the Abbot?"</p><p>"Thanks to my junior sister's guidance, I gained a deeper understanding of the Ice Soul Divine Light, a true epiphany. My own cultivation has also benefited. However, whether this understanding will allow me to breakthrough remains uncertain. I don't have my junior sister's talent."</p><p>Shi Xue smiled brightly, yet remained humble.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded slightly. It seemed Liuli's improvements to the Ice Soul Divine Light were showing progress.</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Qingyang Island.</p><p>Gentle waves lapped against the rocky shore, splashing white foam and making a pleasant sound.</p><p>Five people stood on the shore.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli stood side-by-side, their backs to the sea and sky, watching the three people seeing them off: Tan Hao, Jing Yu, and Shi Xue.</p><p>Over the past two years, Liuli had consolidated her cultivation and returned to the Northern Star Territory with Qin Sang, visiting the ruins left behind by the Purple Micro Palace after its ascension.</p><p>After settling their affairs, they decided to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang mainly had matters concerning Qingyang Temple and some old friends to attend to; she had no other attachments.</p><p>Qingyang Temple was on track, and her task was complete.</p><p>Liuli's situation was simpler.</p><p>She had few connections with Xuan Tian Palace, and following her master's orders, she returned to the Snow Listening Pavilion, presenting herself as a cold beauty, with almost no friends besides Shi Xue.</p><p>Her improvement of the Ice Soul Divine Light was ample repayment to their sect.</p><p>Though cultivating this divine ability remained difficult, at least now the disciples of the Snow Listening Pavilion had hope of mastering it, preventing the sect from becoming a minor branch.</p><p>"Farewell, three friends. There's no need to see us off any further!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, smiling freely.</p><p>Only Shi Xue of the Snow Listening Pavilion knew Liuli's whereabouts.</p><p>Shi Xue held Liuli's hand, her worry evident. "Junior Sister, be careful. If Central State is as prosperous as described, there must be many top experts and powerful forces.  You both left too soon. It would have been safer to wait until you reached the later stages of breakthrough before leaving."</p><p>Jing Yu smiled gently.  "I've never doubted Daoist Qin's abilities, and now with Daoist Liuli's help, we'll surely overcome any danger! We'll guard Daoist Qin's lineage here, waiting for your triumphant return with good news!"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded heavily. "We won't disappoint you!"</p><p>At their level, they were long accustomed to life and death.</p><p>There was little further discussion.</p><p>Watched by the three, Qin Sang and Liuli quietly departed, their figures fading into the waves.</p><p>They avoided notice, secretly leaving the Cui Ming Islands, then accelerated, heading northeast towards the edge of the eastern storm belt of the Demon Realm.</p><p>Their first step toward the Central Plains wasn't south, but east!</p><p>The pair made adjustments in the storm belt, refreshed their energy, and immediately set off.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang and Liuli turned back, gazing for a long time.  They knew they might not see such peace and tranquility again for a long time.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>Qin Sang said softly to Liuli.</p><p>Liuli kept her gaze fixed on the north, finally looking deeply at the distant sky, before summoning the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle.</p><p>The two vanished inside, the shuttle transforming into a green light that plunged into the storm belt.</p><p>After their departure, rumors spread from Qingyang Temple and the Listening Snow Pavilion: Qin Sang and Liuli, husband and wife, were in seclusion on Qingyang Island, jointly pursuing the Dao, vowing not to emerge until they both reached the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Qin Sang had hinted at this during the Qingyang Temple celebration.</p><p>After their departure, the legends of the North Star Fiends not only didn't weaken, but grew even more outlandish, yet no one ever saw their true forms again.</p><p>The battle at the Sacred Land had far-reaching consequences.</p><p>For a long time afterward, the North Sea saw no large-scale wars.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace was in internal turmoil and severely weakened.  Tong Lingyu had to prepare for her own late Yuan Ying stage breakthrough, help Luo Yun recover, and stabilize the sect; she lacked the energy to expand, only managing to secure a few key islands in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's death left the Nine-Headed Great Sage unchecked, stirring unrest.</p><p>However, with the Heavenly Peng Great Sage and many demon kings defeated at the Sacred Land, even with its formidable strength and all the Demon Realm's might, the Nine-Headed Great Sage couldn't break out and confront all of humanity, and was forced to remain within the Demon Realm, continuing its hibernation.</p><p>As for the demonic path, it lost not only top experts but also many demonic inheritances, buried beneath the Exquisite Tower. It would likely take a millennium for them to recover.</p><p>The Boundless Sea, once a paradise for demonic forces, had become the opposite.  These demons were unable to stop the righteous sects from infiltrating, frequently hunted and forced to flee, leading difficult lives in hiding.</p><p>The Great Demon Assembly continued, but it was no longer what its name implied, instead becoming a general North Sea gathering.</p><p>Qingyang Temple prospered amidst this changed environment.</p><p>The North Star Fiends' fearsome reputation remained strong.</p><p>Qingyang Temple and Xuan Tian Palace clearly had close ties.</p><p>Although the North Star Fiends never appeared, Qingyang Temple wasn't short of Yuan Ying cultivators: Tan Hao openly, and Jing Yu, secretly, were rumored to be mysterious experts.</p><p>Initially, no one dared to underestimate Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Disciples traveling abroad, upon learning of their origin, were invariably treated with great respect.</p><p>Much later, after the North Star Fiends completely disappeared without ever making a public appearance, the legends began to lose credibility.  Some started to doubt their existence.</p><p>Perhaps they were afflicted by backlash from secret techniques and died in their secluded cultivation place, all these years deceiving everyone.</p><p>Perhaps they were critically wounded and perished.  If they truly suppressed so many powerful demon kings and cultivators, how could they have paid no price at all?</p><p>…</p><p>By then, Qingyang Temple would have grown strong enough to weather such rumors.</p><p>However, all this was irrelevant to Qin Sang and Liuli, far away from home.</p><p>They couldn't predict the future of the North Sea; their focus was entirely on surviving the storm's assault.</p><p>The sky was dark and tumultuous.</p><p>Hurricane winds, like erratic ink splatters across the heavens, ravaged the land, destroying all serenity and bringing an apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic hurricane.</p><p>A faint green light twisted and turned, moving rapidly.</p><p>The green light was not bright; compared to the overwhelming storm, it was as dim as a dying candle, causing one to worry it might be extinguished at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang, his avatar, and Liuli huddled within the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle, minimizing its presence to avoid attracting unwanted attention.</p><p>Liuli was currently piloting the shuttle.</p><p>Qin Sang looked sideways at the outside, his gaze deep.</p><p>He was no stranger to storm belts, but this was different.</p><p>Upon entering the North Sea, despite significant energy depletion, he was confident that continued forward progress would take him through the storm zone and into the North Sea.</p><p>This journey was fraught with uncertainty.</p><p>They needed to take a long detour, utilizing numerous safe havens to reach Central State.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that even under ideal conditions, the journey would take years.</p><p>The storm zone was extremely hazardous; any unforeseen event could prove fatal.  Reaching a haven demanded extreme caution, carefully verifying the safety of the path ahead.</p><p>This would exponentially increase travel time.</p><p>The first haven was due east, depicted on the sea chart as an underwater tree.</p><p>Based on the estimated distance, Liuli and the external manifestation, using the divine shuttle without consuming pills or spirit stones, should reach the vicinity of the tree before the manifestation's energy was depleted.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body possessed the strongest capabilities.</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, his main body's combat strength should be preserved for emergencies.</p><p>'Whoosh... whoosh... whoosh...'</p><p>One grey hurricane after another narrowly missed the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle, speeding past.</p><p>The storms were unpredictable.</p><p>Liuli, clutching the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn, skillfully maneuvered the shuttle, sometimes soaring high, sometimes making sharp turns, expertly navigating the dangers like dancing on a knife's edge.</p><p>Lower-level cultivators wouldn't even be able to control the shuttle; constantly facing such peril, with their minds on high alert, they would likely collapse before long.</p><p>They delved deeper into the storm zone.</p><p>Even sheltered within the shuttle, Qin Sang felt increasingly oppressed, but this wasn't the storm's worst aspect.</p><p>Qin Sang gently exhaled, clearing his mind, a demonic banner appearing in his palm.</p><p>He entered a meditative state, activating the fire lotus in his Purple Mansion, silently refining demonic fire, cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique.</p><p>His external manifestation sat beside Qin Sang, also cultivating secret techniques.</p><p>Liuli had kept her promise and imparted the "Ice Soul Divine Light" technique.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to have the manifestation attempt the "Ice Soul Divine Light" first.</p><p>Though extremely difficult, once mastered, the intangible Ice Soul Divine Light could assist the main body in restraining opponents, proving surprisingly effective.</p><p>It was better suited to the external manifestation than the Netherworld God Ban and the Profound Heaven Unitary Great Capture Hand.</p><p>Furthermore,</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit insects were also working hard.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly had recently advanced, but was still far from the late fourth transformation stage.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had failed to advance to the fourth transformation.  Qin Sang had commissioned the refinement of numerous Fire Melting Pills, enough for the journey, hoping that a massive quantity of pills would help it break through its bottleneck.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm fell silent after consuming the poison sacs of the frogs and fish, showing no signs of hunger and remaining asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang was uncertain if the Fat Silkworm would undergo a transformation, only hoping it wouldn't cause trouble within the storm zone. A spirit insect tribulation, while less powerful, would still be a major problem in this location.</p><p>As for Ya Gu, Qin Sang still had no effective solution.</p><p>He had completely inscribed the bone curse taught by Bai onto Ya Gu.</p><p>The effects were significant.</p><p>Ya Gu's soul was stable, her breathing even, her face rosy; she showed no signs of aging, appearing as if asleep, yet remained unconscious.</p><p>Qin Sang could only hope that the Fat Silkworm's advancement to the fourth transformation might bring about a change in Ya Gu's condition.</p><p>...</p><p>'Rumble... rumble...'</p><p>The roar of the hurricane drowned out the sound of the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle.</p><p>There was no day or night in the storm zone.</p><p>After an indeterminate period of flight, the end remained invisible.</p><p>Even though the shuttle's energy consumption was low, Liuli's true energy had been depleted by 70-80%, and a hint of weariness was visible in her focused expression.</p><p>Her eyes flickered; taking advantage of a lull in the storm, she awakened Qin Sang's external manifestation.</p><p>The external manifestation awoke, acknowledged her efforts, and immediately took control of the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn and the shuttle.</p><p>Liuli nodded, closed her eyes, and began to recover.</p><p>However, the spiritual energy in the storm zone was too chaotic, unlike the stable environment of the havens; recovery was inefficient.  In such a place, reliance on spirit pills and spirit stones was necessary.</p><p>They both had ample supplies of these.</p><p>This differed somewhat from Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>After the external manifestation's energy was depleted, Qin Sang took over and flew for a while before reaching the location indicated on the sea chart.</p><p>The scenery within the storm zone was monotonous.</p><p>This location was no exception.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the raging waters below, simultaneously using secret incantations to sense the surroundings.  After a moment, his expression brightened, and he suddenly piloted the shuttle downwards at high speed.</p><p>The sea was not a safe haven; chaotic forces were everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang dodged the turbulent currents, his target clear. Not far from their current position, the Sky Eye Butterfly spotted a slender shadow.</p><p>Just as the sea chart depicted.</p><p>It was a tree, its trunk slender, remaining unmoved by the currents, growing from the seabed, its depth unknown, its trunk straight, widening into a crown at the very top.</p><p>It wasn't like a terrestrial tree, but resembled coral.</p><p>The crown was about the size of a house, but incredibly small in the vast ocean.</p><p>The entire coral tree was grey, emitting no unusual fluctuations, and was completely invisible from the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at this, wondering how the cartographer had discovered this place.</p><p>He surveyed the surroundings, ensuring there was no immediate danger, and piloted the shuttle directly towards a branch. Feeling no obstruction, it landed lightly.</p>
