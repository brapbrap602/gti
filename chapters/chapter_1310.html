Chapter 1302: The Killing Intent of Humanity

Qu Huan smiled leisurely and spoke unhurriedly, "I know you all must have many questions. However, the most pressing matter now is to breach Yu City." He pointed in the direction of Yu City. "With the loss of the Dark Crystal Tower, the city's protective formation has a critical flaw they cannot quickly mend. This is the perfect opportunity to break through. Once we breach the outer city, the Sin Abyss will have no choice but to retreat to the inner city. By the time our main forces arrive, we can surround and trap them. With nearly half of their Nascent Soul cultivators already lost, I wonder how long they can hold out!"

"What did you say? Nearly half of their Nascent Souls were lost to the Old Demon Ye?" Even the usually composed Daoist Zhenyi could not remain calm upon hearing this news. His hand gripping the Thousand Jade Whisk tightened abruptly, and he exclaimed in shock.

Qin Sang and the other two were equally stunned.

According to the intelligence Qu Huan had previously relayed, the Old Demon Ye had openly betrayed the alliance in Yu City, slaughtering his former comrades. Naturally, the others would have united against him. Yet, under the watchful eyes of so many, the Old Demon Ye had managed to kill and injure so many before escaping. How terrifying was his strength?

Even a true late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator could not have achieved such a shocking feat. Only a legendary Deity Transformation stage powerhouse could have accomplished this.

A chill ran down Qin Sang's spine. Had the Old Demon Ye been hiding his true strength all along? If the Old Demon Ye were to unleash a massacre at Blood Lake, Qin Sang doubted whether he and his senior sister could escape unscathed.

"Indeed, but there is more to it. Most of the Nascent Souls lost were newly advanced in the past two centuries. The Old Demon Ye has been playing a grand game, and what's even more frightening is that we still don't know his true intentions behind all this!" Qu Huan's face showed a deep sense of awe.

Under Qu Huan's guidance, the group adjusted their strategy to exploit the flaws in the city's protective formation. They unleashed their most powerful treasures and launched a full-scale assault. As they attacked, Qu Huan revealed the inside story.

"The origin of all this traces back to the Sin God Palace. At that time, the righteous and demonic factions of the Sin Abyss were not exactly at each other's throats, but they were far from harmonious. The reason they joined forces was because of that incident. My cultivation was too low at the time, so I wasn't qualified to enter the Sin God Palace. I only learned the general details later. To know the specifics, one would have to ask those who were directly involved. We once made a solemn oath at the Star Eternal Sect, but now that the Old Demon Ye has gone on a killing spree, the foundation of that oath no longer exists, so I need not hold back."

Qu Huan slowly revealed a secret. "Back then, the Old Demon Ye and others discovered a demon in the Sin God Palace. It was said to be an ancient demonic entity that had been imprisoned there and was still alive! The demon was extremely vicious, and they nearly released it, which would have caused a catastrophe. In the end, the righteous and demonic factions joined forces and paid a heavy price to kill the demon!"

A demon!

Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, and he sensed Qing Jun's gaze. The two exchanged a glance, both feeling a sudden realization. This so-called demon was likely an ancient demon, possibly related to the Demon Lord of the Seven Slaughter Palace. No wonder there had been an ancient demonic shadow among the Sin Abyss forces during the battle at the Purple Micro Palace's immortal formation! No wonder he had sensed an aura similar to the Demon Lord from the Dark Crystal Tower!

The Sin God Palace had imprisoned an ancient demon, yet the Sin Abyss cultivators had managed to kill it. Qin Sang was secretly astonished. He was certain that the demon's remaining strength was far inferior to the Demon Lord's. Otherwise, even if all the cultivators of the North Star Realm had united, they would not have been its match.

"What did they find on the demon's body?" Qing Jun keenly grasped the crux of the matter.

The others also realized that the alliance between the righteous and demonic factions of the Sin Abyss, the ambush at the Purple Micro Palace, and their military campaign against the Skywalk Plateau had all occurred after the demon's death. It must be related to this!

Qu Huan glanced at Qing Jun in surprise and nodded. "A great deal! As the demon was on the verge of death, they took advantage of its weakened state to perform a soul-searching technique. The demon was caught off guard, and the technique succeeded. Although the demon quickly counteracted it, they still gained much. For example..."

Qu Huan paused slightly, and his next words sent shivers down everyone's spines.

"The Dark Crystal Tower, a pill known as the Withering Origin Pill, the secrets of Blood Lake, and... the passage between the Sin God Palace and the Purple Micro Palace!"

The ambush at the Purple Micro Palace's immortal formation had nearly doomed the Cold Domain and the Skywalk Alliance. That battle had also marked the beginning of the North Star Realm's turmoil.

"So that's how it was," everyone murmured, their expressions varied as they recalled the past.

"After killing this demon, they tasted the sweetness of success. Through the soul-searching, they learned that another demon was imprisoned in Blood Lake and sought to repeat their feat. However, the demon's strength left them with lingering fears. Worried that they might fail and bring disaster upon themselves, they waited until recently, when the demon had weakened, before entering Blood Lake. Unfortunately, they were too late and only found a jade skeleton..."

Qu Huan sneered slightly. "But now, it seems there might be more to it. From the very beginning, the hunt for the demon in the Sin God Palace might have been a scheme orchestrated by the Old Demon Ye. Today is the day he reaps the rewards!"

Daoist Zhenyi frowned deeply. "What do you mean by that, fellow Daoist? And what is this Withering Origin Pill? Is it a pill, or...?"

The others also pricked up their ears. Earlier, Qu Huan had deliberately mentioned the Withering Origin Pill but had not explained it. It sounded like a pill, yet it was mentioned alongside the Dark Crystal Tower and was a pill from the ancient demon's memories. It must be of utmost importance!

"The Withering Origin Pill is the true reason behind the alliance between the righteous and demonic factions of the Sin Abyss and the outbreak of this war," Qu Huan said, flipping his palm to reveal a dull gray pill. He displayed it before the group. "This pill can significantly increase the chances of breaking through cultivation bottlenecks. Not only can it help Golden Core cultivators form their Nascent Souls, but it also has miraculous effects for Nascent Soul cultivators!"

"What?"

"A divine pill for breaking through bottlenecks! No wonder the Sin Abyss suddenly saw a surge in Nascent Souls!"

"How much does it increase the chances?"

...

The moment these words were spoken, an uproar ensued. Everyone's gaze fixed on the Withering Origin Pill, burning with desire. The pill looked unremarkable, dull gray with no intricate patterns or alluring fragrance. It was hard to imagine it possessed such divine efficacy!

Qin Sang was also tempted, his eyes locked on the pill. However, he did not lose his rationality. Qu Huan's words clearly hinted at something. Holding the Withering Origin Pill but not consuming it himself, instead displaying it openly, surely there was some trick involved. The method of refining the Withering Origin Pill came from the ancient demon's memories, and it was likely not benign. There might be hidden dangers.

Qu Huan noticed the greed in everyone's eyes but was not surprised. The Sin Abyss cultivators had also been driven by this greed, dragging countless lives into this calamity. Thinking this, Qu Huan inwardly mocked himself. Who was he to judge others? Upon learning of the Withering Origin Pill's effects, hadn't he nearly lost his own mind as well?

"According to the memories extracted from the demon, the Withering Origin Pill has no obvious side effects. With such divine efficacy, one can imagine how ecstatic the Heavenly Righteous Elder and the others must have been. In their joy, they almost immediately decided to refine the Withering Origin Pill. However, one of the materials required for its refinement is something profoundly mysteriousâ€”the Killing Intent of Humanity!"
