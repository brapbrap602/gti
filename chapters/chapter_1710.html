<h1>Chapter 1701: Towards Buddhahood</h1><p>Central Plains.</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe and Qing Hu Sheng Wang sat in quiet meditation on their cushions.</p><p>Above their heads hung a yellow cloud, seemingly composed of swirling sand, slowly rotating and casting hazy reflections of their figures. This was the method they used to project their thoughts into Baichuan Ruins.</p><p>Upon hearing Qing Hu Sheng Wang mention the Ancient Gathering Spirit Array,</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe opened his eyes and looked over.</p><p>Noticing Hui Guang Shengzhe's gaze, Qing Hu Sheng Wang chuckled playfully, "You also desire the Ancient Gathering Spirit Array? This array holds profound secrets; it's only effective for humans.  For other races, it would be more harmful than beneficial.  If I give you the array, and in the future, humans flourish, launch an expedition against the East Sea, and annihilate the demon race, wouldn't I become a traitor to my own kind?"</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe remained silent.</p><p>Judging by Qing Hu Sheng Wang's demeanor, she likely didn't care about the fate of the East Sea demons.</p><p>Unless Qing Hu Sheng Wang's previous actions were merely a pretense of indifference.</p><p>"Old monk, don't bother. If this array were truly that valuable, I would have used it to force your compliance long ago,"</p><p>Qing Hu Sheng Wang stated frankly, calmly continuing, "I discovered this array, a fragmented one, in a secluded realm called Pure Sky Island in the East Sea before my breakthrough to the Divine Transformation stage. I attempted to modify the Ancient Gathering Spirit Array to suit the demon race, but failed repeatedly. I can assure you, no one in this world can modify or repair this array. Even if you manage to copy it, your human race would not be able to recreate the Gathering Spirit Array. It's not just the lack of necessary celestial treasures."</p><p>Qing Hu Sheng Wang's certainty hinted at her confidence.</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe was well aware of Qing Hu Sheng Wang's mastery of formations and prohibitions. Her knowledge extended far beyond demon heritage, as demonstrated in the Wuwang Hall.</p><p>During the Demon Subduing War, the suspended lake and bright moon that trapped the demonic body were testament to Qing Hu Sheng Wang's profound understanding and creation of divine powers.  Their effectiveness was undeniable.</p><p>"This array possesses a powerful effect unmatched by other Gathering Spirit Arrays. Besides gathering spiritual energy, it also purifies it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't fully unravel its mysteries," Qing Hu Sheng Wang sighed regretfully.</p><p>Modern cultivators would find it difficult to comprehend the workings of such a unique Gathering Spirit Array.</p><p>However, this world was full of strange phenomena. The Immortal Palace housed even more extraordinary things beyond their imagination and comprehension, remaining unsolved enigmas.</p><p>"After my repeated attempts, and further damage, this Ancient Gathering Spirit Array will gradually self-destruct during use.  Of course, it's more than enough for one person to cultivate with."</p><p>A hint of sarcasm flickered in Qing Hu Sheng Wang's smile. "Judging by this person's aura, he must have recently broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage yet possesses such formidable combat strength. Regardless of his cultivation level, it makes no difference. In this world, only you and I have few equals. Once we cross the East Sea and return to the Netherworld, there will be no one to oppose us.  Wouldn't it be in your best interest to have him break through to the Divine Transformation stage as soon as possible?"</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe remained silent, his eyes lowered.</p><p>Their conversation didn't interfere with the communication in Baichuan Ruins.</p><p>After Qing Hu Sheng Wang's brief description, the avatar already understood the power of this Ancient Gathering Spirit Array.  It was difficult to remain unmoved.</p><p>If Qing Hu Sheng Wang wasn't exaggerating, this array would significantly reduce the time it took for the main body to cultivate, allowing more time to focus on the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>No one would dislike faster cultivation progress.</p><p>But the avatar didn't commit, "Anything else?"</p><p>"Are you seeking treasures that can help break through the Divine Transformation bottleneck?"</p><p>Qing Hu Sheng Wang, seeing through his thoughts, smiled enigmatically. "Such treasures are the rarest in this world. Even in prominent sects, most cultivators rely on their innate talent. Otherwise, wouldn't there be far more Divine Transformation cultivators?  My old monk and I searched the Wuwang Hall for hundreds of years and only found a single Five Elements Pill. I do possess a demon race breakthrough secret technique, but it's not suitable for humans. However, if you know any leads, I can help you obtain it."</p><p>Qing Hu Sheng Wang's every word and action exuded dominance.</p><p>She was tempted to persuade Hui Guang Shengzhe to use Ganlu Zen Temple's treasures to trade with Qin Sang.</p><p>However, these treasures were incredibly precious. Even with the Heavenly Dao Demon Sound obstructing their path, they couldn't easily be given away. Besides, Buddhist treasures required Buddhist cultivation and were unsuitable for Qin Sang.</p><p>Who knew if the Heavenly Dao Demon Sound would inexplicably disappear, or if a solution could be found by chance?</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe's emphasis on the Soul-Calming Incense formula indicated a glimmer of hope that an improved, superior version might have unexpected effects, potentially offering a lifeline for future generations.</p><p>Seeing this request was fruitless, the avatar pressed on, "Are there any clues about the whereabouts of the Ten Divine Trees in the East Sea?"</p><p>Because Yunyou Sword contained Yunyouzi's true spirit, Qin Sang hadn't integrated any more spirit wood into it for many years, fearing it might defile Yunyouzi's true spirit.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang, being in the Yuan Ying stage, focused more on his own cultivation and didn't spend much effort collecting spirit wood.</p><p>Fortunately, the Yunyou Sword had a strong foundation, having previously absorbed the Wujian Blood Mulberry and the Soul-Nourishing Wood, two of the Ten Great Spirit Woods; its material was far superior to ordinary magic treasures.</p><p>With the "Sacrifice Yuan Technique," the cultivation process accelerated significantly.</p><p>In the future, once the Yunyou Sword develops sentience, it can continue absorbing spirit wood.  Collecting them in advance avoids future travel.</p><p>"Ten Great Spirit Woods? Your appetite is quite large!"</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King coldly snorted, her impatience evident.</p><p>Unfortunately, circumstances dictated the situation; she was the one seeking the trade, so she could only suppress her anger and said, "There were rumors of the Ten Great Spirit Woods in the past, but such extraordinary treasures, once they appear, are either secretly taken away, remaining unknown; or are seized by powerful cultivators, refined into useful treasures, and taken away from this world during ascension.  My palace does possess a seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo that has bloomed. While not as good as the Ten Great Spirit Woods, it is still a rare treasure."</p><p>The avatar's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>He had seen the name of the seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo in a certain text.</p><p>While he didn't fully understand its power, even if the Yunyou Sword didn't need it, the entire seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo could be used as a spiritual medium for cultivating the "Post Heaven Wooden Man Stele," surpassing the Chi Xuan Ancient Tree.</p><p>This would eliminate the need to choose between a spirit wood body and an external avatar.</p><p>Before the avatar could respond,</p><p>the Qinghu Saint King proactively offered other treasures.  "I observe your powerful spiritual sense, unmatched by cultivators of your level.  Are you a spiritual cultivator, or do you practice similar secret techniques? I heard you sought such treasures at the Yi Bao Fair, trading Spirit-Subduing Incense for almost a Dragon's Saliva. I also have several treasures beneficial to spiritual cultivation. Of course, if you're confident in breaking through to the Divine Transformation stage, I also have human cultivation techniques for that realmâ€¦"</p><p>Then, the Qinghu Saint King quickly mentioned several names and gave brief introductions.</p><p>Her attitude was quite straightforward; she simply listed the items for Qin Sang to choose from.</p><p>At this time, the Huiguang Saint reminded him that the duration of the secret technique was running out, urging him to decide quickly.</p><p>Mo Xingdao silently observed everything. From the moment he learned of the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound, his actions were no longer his own.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and the Qinghu Saint King haggling, unaware of the situation, it's unknown what was going through Mo Xingdao's mind.</p><p>However, none of the three could see the avatar's current expression.</p><p>Upon hearing the power of one of the secret techniques mentioned by the Qinghu Saint King, the avatar fell completely silent, not uttering a single word; his eyes flickered incessantly, seemingly continuously calculating something.</p><p>His expression revealed surprise, astonishment, and a hint of nervousness.</p><p>Reminded by the Huiguang Saint, the avatar steadied himself, feigning normalcy as he asked some questions, narrowly avoiding blurting out an agreement.</p><p>Of course, he still possessed some self-control.</p><p>He needed to return to Luye and jointly analyze the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of this trip with his original body, determining whether the risk was worthwhile.</p><p>Dismissing distracting thoughts, the avatar continued to ask questions.</p><p>He had too many questions; this rare opportunity to directly consult a Divine Transformation cultivator had to be seized.</p><p>The avatar's following questions were no longer about the trade.</p><p>"Why did the ferocious beasts suddenly riot in the storm? As far as I know, there were no ferocious beasts around the cultivation world before. They always lived in their nests, the Abyss of Return. Did something happen in the Abyss of Return?"</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli met, naturally learning secrets from her, including the name and approximate direction of the Ascension Land.</p><p>The Yan Yue Monastery's texts recorded that the Dao Marker was located in the East Sea Abyss of Return, where ferocious beasts lurked, danger abounded, and even Divine Transformation cultivators dared not venture in.</p><p>For many years, the ferocious beasts seemed to be under some kind of constraint and generally would not leave the Abyss of Return to cause trouble. Qin Sang had traveled through the Canglang Sea, the Demon Sea, the Central Plains, and the North Sea, and had never heard of ferocious beasts appearing.</p><p>There might be exceptions, but such a dense appearance of ferocious beasts was definitely abnormal.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King desperately wanted the Spirit-Subduing Incense formula.</p><p>A thought arose in the avatar's mind: Could it be related to this?</p><p>"I'm also curious why the ferocious beasts are rioting. I've sent my subordinates and the old monk's disciples to patrol the outskirts of the storm belt, preparing to capture a ferocious beast to investigate the cause. If you're willing to help, I'll reserve a spot for you during the hunt."</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King unexpectedly tried to coax him into helping hunt the beasts, not surprised that he might think of this connection.</p><p>In fact, those who knew the relationship between the East Sea Abyss of Return and the Dao Marker all speculated that something had happened in the Abyss of Return.</p><p>But no one could have predicted that it wasn't Gui Xu that changed, but the entire Xia Qian world!</p><p>It wasn't the Ascension Path that was severed, but the Transcendence Path!</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe explained, "In the past, the reason they were called ferocious beasts was because they were inherently bloodthirsty, with low intelligence, driven by cruel instincts, and were one of the most dangerous things to be wary of in Gui Xu."</p><p>So, the ferocious beasts didn't suddenly go mad.</p><p>Hua Shen thought, that's normal.  With the terrifying power of the ferocious beast tribes, if they possessed intelligence, the cultivation world would have long since become a beast's lair.</p><p>"During the hunt, Qin might send an external avatar to assist the Sheng Seng. However, if the Sheng Seng obtains any information from the beasts, I hope to share it with Qin."</p><p>Hua Shen added a condition.</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe responded, "Master Qin agrees?"</p><p>"My avatar is out on its own and needs to discuss with me first. I will give the Sheng Seng an answer as soon as possible."</p><p>With that, the glow on Mo Xingdao's talisman faded.</p><p>Silence returned to the cave dwelling.</p><p>Two shadowy figures melted away like ice and snow.  Hui Guang Shengzhe left a single sentence:</p><p>"Master Mo, please return to Xiao Fangcun Mountain."</p><p>...</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The talisman shattered.</p><p>The avatar emerged from its hiding place.</p><p>The moonlight was like water.</p><p>This place was far from Bai Chuan Xu, and the scene there was invisible. The avatar didn't even look towards Bai Chuan Xu, disappearing in a flash.</p><p>Then, the avatar traveled through the Northern Wastelands for a month.</p><p>He seemed aimless, like he was sightseeing in the Northern Wastelands, rarely stopping.  Neither treacherous mountains and rivers nor the raging Nine Calamities of the Northern Wastelands could impede his progress.</p><p>It was during this wandering period that the avatar communicated with his original body.</p><p>No physical contact was needed.</p><p>From a distance, Qin Sang's original body, hidden in Lu Ye, subtly perceived the avatar's experiences and the content of his exchanges with the two tribes' Transcendence stage cultivators through telepathy.</p><p>Even after the exchange, the avatar wasn't called back.  He had prepared to stay away for a long time before leaving.</p><p>Upon learning the details, the original body in the cave dwelling stood up, his expression shifting.</p><p>After all, they were one entity; the expression of the original body when weighing his options was very similar to that of the avatar.</p><p>It must be said that the conditions offered by Hui Guang Shengzhe and Qing Hu Sheng Wang were too tempting. To escape the threat and gain time for peaceful cultivation was something Qin Sang desperately desired.</p><p>But he also knew he had to be prepared to sacrifice this avatar.</p><p>The key question was whether the benefits were great enough, whether it was worth the gamble.</p><p>...</p><p>Shortly after the avatar's negotiations with the two tribes' Transcendence stage cultivators.</p><p>The high-level officials of the Dao, Buddha, and Demon sects left Gui Yan Plateau together.</p><p>Some personnel were left in the relic to continue exploration, but the sects' focus was clearly elsewhere.</p><p>Following this, the high-level officials of the three sects became very active.  Various signs indicated that something big was about to happen. Those well-informed sensed something unusual and felt uneasy.</p><p>Surprisingly, the first action of the three sects was to jointly clear the name of one person, and it was Hui Guang Shengzhe himself who stepped forward.</p><p>Xie Family Ancestor, Qingfeng Daochang!</p><p>At this time, people finally learned that the rumors were true. In a moment of crisis, Qingfeng Daochang had saved the situation, offering the supreme treasure to subdue the demon, preventing a catastrophic loss of life.</p><p>Even more enviable were the subsequent rewards.</p><p>Bo County and two other counties were given to the Xie family, with forces within the counties being withdrawn by various parties.  In addition, there was various support declared by different sects; it was no exaggeration to say he had risen to the top in a single step.</p><p>Apart from being treated as a VIP by various sects, Qingfeng Daochang himself didn't seem to gain much. Only a few people knew that he had taken the Five Elements Pill, the greatest benefit.</p><p>With Qingfeng Daochang's current reputation, probably no one dared to openly compete for the Five Elements Pill.</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe fulfilled his promise.</p><p>Qin Sang, far away in the Northern Wastelands, already knew everything.</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>Ganlu Chan Yuan suddenly struck the welcome bell.</p><p>The bell tolled eighty-one times, clearly audible even in Fei Yun Du.</p><p>Fei Yun Du was in an uproar.</p><p>This was Ganlu Chan Yuan's signal for welcoming its most honored guests. The last time the bell was struck was when Lu Lao Mo, with the might of a Transcendence stage cultivator, arrived in a light boat from the south.</p><p>However, various factions in the Central Plains had already learned the news through various channels.</p><p>The mysterious Qingfeng Daochang finally appeared, paying a visit to Ganlu Chan Yuan.</p><p>Moreover, some busybodies from various sects had arrived at Ganlu Chan Yuan early to have a glimpse.</p><p>The mountain temple was serene.</p><p>But today, it was unusually bustling.</p><p>A figure ascended the steps calmly and confidently, captivating everyone.</p><p>The bell tolled eighty-one times.</p><p>The gates of Ganlu Chan Yuan swung open.</p><p>Master Xingji personally greeted him.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, the two exchanged greetings.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar said aloud, "This poor Daoist has always had a heart inclined towards Buddhism, and although I have entered the Daoist sect, I have not forgotten my earlier aspirations.  I wish to stay in the Chan Yuan for a while, to comprehend Buddhist principles and seek peace and tranquility in the Pure Land.  Would the Sheng Seng be so kind as to grant this?"</p><p>Master Xingji was slightly surprised, but readily agreed, "Excellent! Excellent! The Buddha is compassionate and embraces all beings, opening the door to convenience.  But by the wisdom of convenience, from the fire house of the three realms, to save sentient beings."</p>
