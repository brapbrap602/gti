<h1>Chapter 2001: Mister Hong</h1><p>‘Clip-clop, clip-clop…’</p><p>A carriage traveled at a leisurely pace along the official road. The carriage wasn't large, with room for only three or four people, yet it was drawn by a rare pair of horses.</p><p>Other travelers on the road were drawn to this unusual carriage.</p><p>The carriage lacked extravagant decorations, yet it possessed a unique quality.</p><p>The two horses were also extraordinary. Tall and powerfully built, their coats were blood-red, shimmering like the finest brocade under the scorching sun.</p><p>The carriage driver sat ramrod straight. Though a mere driver, his gaze held a lofty disdain as he looked upon the other travelers, an air that even the drivers of high-ranking officials in the city lacked.</p><p>The twin horses moved with swift, powerful strides. A small town appeared ahead on the road.</p><p>“Daoist Master, look, Hanwan Town is just ahead…”</p><p>The driver bowed slightly, addressing the person inside the carriage, his demeanor unconsciously becoming more respectful.</p><p>“Stop the carriage.”</p><p>A calm voice drifted out from within.</p><p>The driver acknowledged the command, gently tugging the reins. Both horses simultaneously raised their forelegs, stamping heavily on the ground, coming to a halt in perfect unison with the carriage. The carriage body didn't even sway, causing the onlookers to widen their eyes in astonishment.</p><p>The carriage door opened, and a Daoist priest stepped out, squinting as he surveyed the town ahead.</p><p>The driver, his face wreathed in smiles, attentively attended to him, following the Daoist's gaze, a flicker of curiosity in his heart.</p><p>This man was clearly a master, yet he wondered why such a person would come to this insignificant town, even by mortal standards.</p><p>He had specifically inquired about the route before finding this place.</p><p>The Daoist nodded slightly, tossing a small pouch to the driver. “You may return.”</p><p>The driver opened the pouch, his face breaking into a wide grin. “Yes! Daoist Master, safe travels. I'm often in the Sanqi Isles. If you ever need anything, just call for me.”</p><p>Knowing the temperament of such masters, the driver didn't dawdle or dare to ask further questions. He immediately turned the carriage around and sped back the way he came.</p><p>After traveling for some time, reaching a deserted stretch of road, the driver flicked his wrist. The horsewhip cracked, not striking the horses, but instead dissolving into a cloud of mist. Both the horses and the carriage gradually faded away.</p><p>The flanks of the twin horses rippled, revealing a pair of blood-red wings. With a gentle flap, they lifted off the ground, soaring into the clouds, swift as falcons, vanishing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The Daoist who had disembarked was, of course, Qin Sang.</p><p>He strolled into Hanwan Town, listening to the cries of the street vendors, immersing himself in the bustle of human life.</p><p>After the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's successful tribulation, Qin Sang had first assisted Taiyi in mastering the Thunder Altar and then imparted swordsmanship to Yulang. Calculating that the time was right, he had chosen an auspicious moment to embark on this journey.</p><p>For this trip, Qin Sang brought Guihou and Luohou with him. On the day of his departure, those who saw him off included Taiyi, Yulang, Lingshi, Hongmei, and Er’yao, the core disciples of the Green Ram Temple. The only outsider present was Gu Yunsuo.</p><p>The identity Qin Sang had carefully cultivated for Gu Yunsuo was that of a disciple from a powerful sect traveling abroad, so there was no need for concealment. Openness and honesty were more believable.</p><p>To the outside world, he proclaimed that he was entering secluded cultivation, devoting himself to arduous practice, and would henceforth withdraw from worldly affairs.</p><p>When Venerable Yue delivered the yellow leaf token, he kindly warned Qin Sang about some restless areas on the road to Extreme Heaven Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang avoided these areas. Although it added some distance to his journey, it ensured a smooth journey to Extreme Heaven Peak.</p><p>The cultivation world of Extreme Heaven Peak was similar to Mooncry Bay, centered around a giant island, encompassing the vast surrounding sea and countless smaller islands.</p><p>However, when local cultivators spoke of Extreme Heaven Peak, they referred to a specific mountain peak.</p><p>This peak was the highest on the island, said to reach the Nine Heavens, immeasurable in height, with an exceptionally majestic presence.</p><p>The reason for such legends was that the most powerful sect, the Extreme Heaven Palace, occupied the summit, shrouded in awe and mystery.</p><p>Unlike the Mooncry Bay cultivation world, the top sects here were all gathered in one place, their gates built on Extreme Heaven Peak, countless sects arranged along the mountain slopes, constantly within sight of each other.</p><p>This demonstrated the sheer scale of Extreme Heaven Peak. The eastern side of the island, occupying more than three-tenths of the island's area, could be considered the mountain's base.</p><p>This place gathered all the spiritual energy of the island. Layers upon layers of mountain ridges accumulated, creating a towering momentum, a solitary peak piercing the sky.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators lacked the power to make such a grand alteration. It was unknown whether it was the work of a Spirit Severing cultivator or perhaps truly a marvel of nature.</p><p>The unique terrain shaped this arrangement.</p><p>After landing on the island, Qin Sang didn't go to Extreme Heaven Peak. He rented a flying horse carriage and instructed the driver to seek out a place called Hanwan Town.</p><p>Mister Hong resided in this mortal town.</p><p>Passing through the town, the hustle and bustle gradually faded. North of the town lay a mountain. The other party hadn't deliberately concealed themselves, and Qin Sang sensed the aura of a formation from afar. This mountain was undoubtedly a blessed land.</p><p>Qin Sang reached the foot of the mountain and saw a village below, wisps of smoke curling upwards, reminding him of Seven Rows Village and his days of seclusion at the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>绕过村落，一条林中小径通往山脚，曲径通幽，秦桑很快便看到一个篱笆小院。</p><p>清泉之畔，三间茅屋，院内有一园圃，植满各种鲜花，争奇斗艳。</p><p>一位老农正在花园里侍弄着，大咧咧蹲在地上，双手占满泥土。</p><p>几个小孩子在花园里嬉闹。</p><p>秦桑隔着篱笆打了个稽首，“敢问可是洪先生？”</p><p>老农抬起头，眯眼打量了秦桑一会儿，随意在衣服上拍去手上的泥土，起身道：“是清风道长吧？”</p><p>“正是贫道，”秦桑看了看那些孩子，都是凡人。</p><p>“好了，洪爷爷家里来客人了，你们也该回去吃饭了，等会儿又要被爹娘骂，”洪先生拍了拍手，折下几枝花儿，一人送了一枝。</p><p>小孩子排队接过花儿，乖巧地挥手告别，“洪爷爷再见。”</p><p>“道长请进。”</p><p>洪先生邀秦桑进来，问道，“灿金城还要十年方到，道长可等得？”</p><p>秦桑回道，“等得。”</p><p>洪先生点点头，又问道：“此地粗陋，道长可耐得？”</p><p>“山不在高，有仙则名，水不在深，有龙则灵，何陋之有？”</p><p>秦桑微微一笑，反问道。</p><p>“哈哈，道长也是个妙人，”洪先生大笑，抬手指山，“山上的庐舍洞府皆是无主之物，道长可随意择一处歇息。”</p><p>秦桑道了声谢，谨遵樾上师的提醒，其他事决不多问。</p><p>只是在进入小院后，忍不住多看了眼园圃。</p><p>洪先生大概率也是一位丹道宗师，这种人养的花，恐怕每一株都是世间罕有的天材地宝。</p><p>可园圃里都是凡间的花儿。</p><p>进来之前，他本以为是什么高明的大阵，连他都看不透，进来后才确定，这些花真的就是凡花，甚至有田地里最常见的野花。</p><p>这位洪先生气息深沉隐晦，定是一位高人，难道也在入凡历世吗？</p><p>许是秦桑的回答令洪先生产生了好感，注意到秦桑的视线，洪先生主动解释道：“走得远了，回过头看看，这些凡间草木不像灵花灵草那般娇贵，老夫可以随心所欲，倒也颇有妙趣……”</p><p>他指向园圃旁一陇稻花，“据说外面在争什么大乘、小乘，道长觉得，我若培育出一种良米，解决世间饥饿，能不能封一个农圣？”</p><p>“怪不得汗宛镇周围的稻米，长势格外喜人。”</p><p>秦桑笃定道，“先生如果真能做到，封圣是一定的，而且是诸族共圣！”</p><p>心里却在思忖，看来所谓大乘之道，不在于称王称祖。</p><p>如果真能够走通这些‘道’，有一点是肯定的，大能心系黎民、造福世人，将会给大千世界带来翻天覆地的变化。</p><p>问题是究竟能不能走得通。</p><p>“封圣又如何？能让你我一步登仙吗？”洪先生摇摇头，挥动衣袖，茅庐后面现出一条小径，示意秦桑自行上山。</p><p>见洪先生没有深谈的欲望，秦桑也不便多言，随意在山上挑了一间洞府，布下阵法，闭门静修。</p><p>内视气海。</p><p>已经是渡劫后的第二十个年头，天目蝶依然在呼呼大睡，没有苏醒的迹象。</p><p>不过能够感觉到，天目蝶的气息渐趋沉稳，想必是正在消化体内的劫雷之力。</p><p>查看了一下，秦桑便继续自己的修行。</p><p>此后他将以提升修为为重，但四象剑阵还是要参悟的。</p><p>尤其南方朱雀剑阵，完善之后，四象演其二，威力也不容小觑。</p><p>每次参悟剑阵，秦桑都要唤醒朱雀，请它帮助，此次也不例外。</p><p>“见到洪先生了？”朱雀醒来，立刻迫不及待发问。</p><p>秦桑嗯了一声。</p><p>“终于能够见识真正的大千世界！沧海桑田，不知大千世界变成什么样了，”朱雀感慨，语气充满沧桑，犹如一位历经无数岁月的老前辈。</p><p>秦桑斜觑，“你记起来以前了？”</p><p>“没有！”</p><p>朱雀理直气壮，反咬一口，“还不都怪你太慢！”</p><p>突破化神期后，朱雀的修为又开始迅速提升，如今距离化神后期亦不远矣。</p><p>不过，朱雀声称，它感觉自己的潜力快用尽了，两枚真羽以及自己以前的底蕴，估计无法支撑它突破炼虚期。</p><p>以后可能只能靠自己苦修了，这让它怎能习惯。</p><p>“确定了？”秦桑问。</p><p>看之前朱雀的势头，秦桑本以为他很快就能再多一个炼虚期的帮手呢。</p><p>“不知道！”</p><p>朱雀嘴上够硬，却有些垂头丧气，抓住秦桑的袖子，连声埋怨，“你还不抓紧时间，这都过去多少年了！”</p><p>秦桑无奈，他也希望早日炼化麒麟源种。</p><p>现在面对同阶修士，他的神识毫无优势，反而受到限制。</p><p>如果不顾一切吞噬，可能已经完成了，但朱雀提出种种要求，难度增加了何止几倍。</p><p>之前便感应到了生命的波动，可那个临界点迟迟没有到来，也不知朱雀的说法靠不靠谱，能不能孵出一枚麒麟卵。</p><p>麒麟卵诞生之后，可能还要时间去孵化，也就是炼虚修士足够长命，否则都要被麒麟源种熬死了。</p><p>“等你修炼到化神巅峰再说这些吧，到时候先设法帮你突破炼虚。”</p><p>秦桑传音道了一句，衍生剑阵，命朱雀入阵。</p><p>等到第三年。</p><p>秦桑感知到山中出现了一道陌生的气息，走出洞府，见到一个头戴斗笠的人。</p><p>斗笠垂纱，遮住面目和整个上身。</p><p>此人行走时低着头，斗笠是一件异宝，在斗笠的遮掩下，此人的气息混沌不明。</p><p>似乎没料到山中有人，突然见到秦桑，斗笠人猛地顿住。</p><p>秦桑打了个稽首，正要开口，却见斗笠人微微拱手，一语不发，匆匆进入一间空的精舍，封闭门户。</p><p>秦桑暗道古怪，有宝物蒙蔽，不施法进行探查，他也不能确定斗笠人的真正修为。</p><p>在洪先生的道场不好深究。</p><p>此人想必也是要前往大周的，希望途中不要引来麻烦。</p><p>秦桑在门口站了一会儿，转回洞府，继续修炼。</p><p>到了第二年，又有一人进山。</p><p>此人比斗篷人活泛多了，见到秦桑，立即热情招呼，自称法号怀庭，修为和秦桑相当。</p><p>萍水相逢，双方都知晓分寸，不会深究对方的来历，秦桑只知怀庭也非极天峰修士。</p><p>“道长也是要往大周去吧？早就听闻极天峰修仙界的格局迥异于别处，以后不知何时才能回来，途径此地，何不去见识见识？”怀庭热情邀请秦桑同去。</p><p>秦桑暗想，自己此行正是为了游历大千，修行也不在这一时，便应承下来。</p><p>二人知会洪先生一声，结伴飞向极天峰。</p><p>汗宛镇离极天峰不算远，二人不紧不慢飞了两个时辰到达山脚。</p><p>在汗宛镇就能看到东方山影，临到近前，更能感受到此山的宏伟。</p><p>层层山梁，地貌万千。</p><p>山中有荒野、丛林、江河湖泽，亦有无数城池，又有奇光闪动，乃是一些修仙宗门所在。</p><p>这么多凡人、修士和门派聚集在一座山上，也不显拥挤。</p><p>二人远远欣赏了一会儿，隐藏修为，低调入山，在山中盘旋数日，果然见识到许多极天峰独有的风貌。</p><p>极天峰修仙界以极天宫为首，其他门派也都隶属于极天宫。</p><p>这些门派都被称为某某宫，宗门之主有参与极天宫议事之权，相当于在极天宫任职。</p><p>组织比一些联盟紧密，但又不像道门符��派，将道庭和宫观分隔开。</p><p>一个宗门就是极天宫的一个分部，行使某个方面的职权。</p><p>各个宗门各自独立，又彼此约束着，结成一张复杂且畸形的网，就这么运转到现在，看得秦桑和怀庭啧啧称奇。</p><p>他们最终也没有显露身份，拜访极天宫，游览一番便返回汗宛镇。</p><p>出人意料，后面就没有其他人来了。</p><p>直至秦桑到来的第十年。</p><p>这一日清晨，秦桑被一声鼓响惊醒。</p><p>秦桑推门出去，闪身掠至山顶，见洪先生手擎一面铜鼓，轻轻一抛，铜鼓膨大开来。</p><p>除了洪先生，就只有他们三个人。</p><p>“三位请上来吧，灿金城的执事到了。”</p><p>待三人登上铜鼓，洪先生御使铜鼓向北飞去，一直飞出海外。</p><p>Bypassing the village, a small path through the forest led to the foot of the mountain, winding and secluded.  Qin Sang soon came upon a fenced-in courtyard.</p><p>Beside a clear spring stood three thatched cottages. Within the courtyard was a garden, filled with a vibrant array of flowers, each vying for attention.</p><p>An old farmer was tending the garden, squatting casually on the ground, his hands covered in soil.</p><p>Several children frolicked amidst the flowers.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed from outside the fence.  "Might I inquire if you are Mister Hong?"</p><p>The old farmer looked up, squinting at Qin Sang for a moment.  He casually wiped the dirt from his hands onto his clothes and stood up. "Are you Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>“Indeed, I am,” Qin Sang replied, glancing at the children, all mortals.</p><p>“Alright, children, Grandpa Hong has a guest.  It’s time for you to go home for dinner, or your parents will scold you.”  Mister Hong clapped his hands and plucked a few flowers, giving one to each child.</p><p>The children lined up, politely accepting the flowers and waving goodbye.  “Goodbye, Grandpa Hong.”</p><p>“Daoist, please come in.”</p><p>Mister Hong invited Qin Sang inside and asked, "Goldenlight City is still ten years away. Can you wait?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "I can wait."</p><p>Mister Hong nodded and asked again, "This place is humble. Can you endure it?"</p><p>“A mountain isn't famous for its height, but for the immortals who dwell there. Water isn't deep, but for the dragons that inhabit it. What's humble about this place?” Qin Sang countered with a slight smile.</p><p>"Haha, Daoist, you are a man of wit," Mister Hong laughed heartily, pointing up the mountain. "The huts and caves on the mountain are all unoccupied. Feel free to choose one to rest in."</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, heeding Venerable Yue's warning and refraining from asking any further questions.</p><p>However, after entering the courtyard, he couldn't help but glance at the garden again.</p><p>Mister Hong was most likely a master alchemist.  The flowers cultivated by such a person were probably all rare and precious heavenly treasures.</p><p>Yet, the garden was filled with ordinary mortal flowers. Some were even common wildflowers found in fields.</p><p>Mister Hong's aura was deep and obscure, clearly a master.  Could he also be experiencing mortal life?</p><p>Perhaps Qin Sang's response had earned him some favor. Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Mister Hong offered an explanation, "Having traveled far, looking back, these mortal plants are not as delicate as spiritual flowers and herbs. I can tend to them as I please, which is quite enjoyable…"</p><p>He pointed to a patch of rice flowers beside the garden. "I hear the outside world debates about the Greater Path and the Lesser Path. Daoist, what do you think? If I were to cultivate a superior strain of rice, solving the world's hunger, could I be bestowed the title of Agricultural Sage?"</p><p>“No wonder the rice around Hanwan Town grows so exceptionally well.”</p><p>Qin Sang affirmed, "If you truly achieve that, Mister, you would certainly be recognized as a Sage, revered by all races!"</p><p>Inwardly, he pondered. It seemed that the so-called Greater Path wasn't about becoming a king or an ancestor.</p><p>If one could truly walk these 'Paths', one thing was certain:  A powerful being concerned for the common people, benefiting the world, would bring earth-shattering changes to the vast world.</p><p>The question was, could such a path truly be traversed?</p><p>"What good is being a Sage? Can it grant us instant ascension?"  Mister Hong shook his head, waving his sleeve.  A small path appeared behind the cottage, gesturing for Qin Sang to ascend the mountain.</p><p>Seeing Mister Hong’s lack of desire for further conversation, Qin Sang refrained from speaking further, casually choosing a cave on the mountain. He set up a formation and closed the entrance to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>He looked inwards to his spiritual sea.</p><p>It had been twenty years since his tribulation, and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was still sound asleep, showing no signs of awakening.</p><p>However, he could sense that the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's aura was gradually stabilizing, likely digesting the power of the tribulation lightning within its body.</p><p>After checking on it, Qin Sang continued his own cultivation.</p><p>From now on, he would prioritize improving his cultivation, but the Four Symbols Sword Formation still needed to be comprehended.</p><p>Especially the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation. Once perfected, with two of the Four Symbols manifested, its power shouldn't be underestimated.</p><p>Every time he contemplated the sword formation, Qin Sang would awaken the Vermilion Bird for its assistance. This time was no exception.</p><p>“Did you meet Mister Hong?” The Vermilion Bird asked eagerly upon awakening.</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in affirmation.</p><p>"Finally, I can witness the true vast world!  Seas change into mulberry fields, I wonder what the vast world has become," the Vermilion Bird sighed, its tone filled with the vicissitudes of time, like an ancient elder who had lived through countless ages.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways.  “Have you remembered your past?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Vermilion Bird retorted righteously, turning the tables.  “It’s all your fault for being so slow!”</p><p>After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, the Vermilion Bird’s cultivation had begun to rapidly increase again, now not far from the Late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>However, the Vermilion Bird claimed it felt its potential was nearly exhausted.  The two true feathers and its previous foundation were likely insufficient to support its breakthrough to the Spirit Severing stage.</p><p>In the future, it might have to rely on its own arduous cultivation, which it found difficult to accept.</p><p>“Are you certain?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Seeing the Vermilion Bird’s previous momentum, Qin Sang had thought he would soon have another Spirit Severing helper.</p><p>"I don’t know!”</p><p>Despite its tough words, the Vermilion Bird sounded dejected, clutching Qin Sang's sleeve and complaining repeatedly, “Hurry up! How many years has it been!”</p><p>Qin Sang was helpless. He also wished to refine the Qilin Source Seed sooner.</p><p>Currently, when facing cultivators of the same rank, his divine sense held no advantage and was, in fact, restricted.</p><p>If he had devoured it recklessly, he might have already finished, but the Vermilion Bird had made various demands, increasing the difficulty severalfold.</p><p>He had previously sensed the fluctuations of life, but that critical point had yet to arrive.  He didn’t know how reliable the Vermilion Bird’s claims were or whether a Qilin egg could truly be hatched.</p><p>After the Qilin egg was born, it might take even more time to hatch.  Only Spirit Severing cultivators lived long enough; otherwise, they would be consumed by the Qilin Source Seed.</p><p>"Let's talk about this when you reach the peak of Nascent Soul.  At that time, I’ll find a way to help you break through to Spirit Severing."</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted his voice, then manifested the sword formation, ordering the Vermilion Bird to enter.</p><p>In the third year…</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an unfamiliar aura in the mountains.  He exited his cave and saw a figure wearing a wide-brimmed hat.</p><p>A veil hung from the hat, obscuring the person’s face and entire upper body.</p><p>The figure walked with its head lowered. The hat was a magical treasure, and under its concealment, the person’s aura was chaotic and indistinct.</p><p>Seemingly surprised to encounter someone in the mountains, the hat-wearing figure abruptly stopped upon seeing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, about to speak, but the figure simply gave a slight bow in return, remaining silent, and hurried into an empty hermitage, sealing the entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang found this odd.  With the treasure's concealment, without using spells to investigate, he couldn’t determine the hat-wearing figure’s true cultivation level.</p><p>It wouldn't be appropriate to pry too deeply within Mister Hong’s domain.</p><p>This person was likely also headed to the Great Zhou Dynasty. He hoped they wouldn't cause any trouble along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance for a while, then returned to his cave to continue cultivating.</p><p>The following year, another person arrived in the mountains.</p><p>This person was much more sociable than the hat-wearing figure. Upon seeing Qin Sang, they greeted him warmly, introducing themselves as Huaiting, a cultivator of similar realm.</p><p>A chance encounter, both sides knew their boundaries and didn’t pry into each other’s origins. Qin Sang only knew that Huaiting wasn’t a cultivator from Extreme Heaven Peak.</p><p>“Daoist, are you also heading to the Great Zhou Dynasty? I've long heard that the cultivation world of Extreme Heaven Peak is unique. I don't know when I'll have the chance to return. Since we’re passing through, why not go and see for ourselves?”  Huaiting enthusiastically invited Qin Sang to join him.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that this journey was precisely for experiencing the vast world, and cultivation could wait.  He agreed.</p><p>The two informed Mister Hong and set off together towards Extreme Heaven Peak.</p><p>Hanwan Town wasn't far from Extreme Heaven Peak. They flew at a leisurely pace for two hours, reaching the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The mountain's shadow could be seen from Hanwan Town, but up close, its grandeur was truly awe-inspiring.</p><p>Layer upon layer of mountain ridges, a myriad of landscapes.</p><p>Within the mountains were wildernesses, forests, rivers, lakes, and countless cities.  Flickering lights indicated the locations of various cultivation sects.</p><p>So many mortals, cultivators, and sects gathered on one mountain, yet it didn't feel crowded.</p><p>The two admired the view from afar, concealing their cultivation, and entered the mountain discreetly.  They explored for several days, witnessing many unique sights of Extreme Heaven Peak.</p><p>The Extreme Heaven Peak cultivation world was led by the Extreme Heaven Palace, and all other sects were subordinate to it.</p><p>These sects were all referred to as “something-something Palace,” and their sect masters had the right to participate in the Extreme Heaven Palace’s council, akin to holding office within the palace.</p><p>Their organization was tighter than some alliances, but unlike the Daoist Talisman Sects, they didn't separate the Dao Court and the temple-monasteries.</p><p>Each sect was a branch of the Extreme Heaven Palace, exercising authority in a specific area.</p><p>The sects were independent yet also restrained each other, forming a complex and unusual web that had somehow functioned until now, leaving Qin Sang and Huaiting marveling.</p><p>In the end, they didn’t reveal their identities or visit the Extreme Heaven Palace. After exploring for a while, they returned to Hanwan Town.</p><p>Unexpectedly, no one else arrived after them.</p><p>Until the tenth year of Qin Sang’s arrival.</p><p>One morning, Qin Sang was awakened by the sound of a drum.</p><p>He pushed open the door, flashed to the mountaintop, and saw Mister Hong holding a bronze drum. With a gentle toss, the drum expanded.</p><p>Besides Mister Hong, only the three of them were present.</p><p>"Please come aboard, you three. The steward from Goldenlight City has arrived."</p><p>Once the three boarded the drum, Mister Hong steered it northward, flying out over the sea.</p>
