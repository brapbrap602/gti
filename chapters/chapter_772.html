<h1>Chapter 764: Reversal of Fortunes</h1><p>Qin Sang knew the young man was going all out.</p><p>He remained hidden within the Ten Directions Yama Array, refusing to emerge.</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Fire burst from the banner array, engulfing the golden ring.  For a moment, the golden light was shrouded in demonic flames, seemingly merging, but in reality engaging in a fierce contest, each attempting to suppress the other in a confined space.</p><p>The golden ring, capable of binding enemy artifacts, seemed helpless against the Netherworld Demon Fire, its emitted rings shattered by the flames.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's cultivation was inferior to the young man's, wearing his poison-resistant armor he needn't fear the poisonous mist.  He prioritized a steady defense, while the young man had to constantly divert his attention to counter the mist and was desperate to kill Qin Sang quickly.</p><p>The three Ten Directions Yama banners formed an array far surpassing ordinary mid-grade artifacts.  As a result, the more anxious the young man became, the less effective his attacks were.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Fire, buffeted by the golden ring's relentless assault, fluctuated and trembled, yet held firm.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave.  The disparity in their strengths was evident.  Destroying the jade bracelet had given him the upper hand, but he had to guard against the young man's last-ditch effort; a single lapse could lead to his demise.</p><p>Before the destruction of the bracelet, the young man had been hesitant, constrained in his attacks to protect it, unwilling to engage in a direct confrontation. Now, he had no choice but to gamble everything.</p><p>His eyes blazed with murderous intent, his attacks relentless.</p><p>Qin Sang's strength surpassed his expectations.  This mere mid-stage Core Formation cultivator possessed not only astonishing swordsmanship but also such a powerful artifact.</p><p>With this artifact, overcoming Qin Sang quickly was nearly impossible.</p><p>Witnessing the power of the Ten Directions Yama Array, the young man doubled down, relentlessly and recklessly pouring his true essence into the golden ring to press his attack.</p><p>The young man's offensive was like a raging storm.</p><p>Qin Sang concentrated all his attention on controlling the artifact.  The two-headed beast beside him panted, then unleashed a gust of wind blades to ease the pressure on Qin Sang.</p><p>The combined efforts of man and beast almost managed to suppress the golden ring.</p><p>At that moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Green light erupted from the ground, instantly covering the area in a carpet of verdant growth, with plants rapidly growing, fiercely attacking Qin Sang's position.  These were not plants, but incredibly sharp sword energies!</p><p>‘Swish swish…’</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Array was enveloped by the sword energies; the young man intended to pierce Qin Sang with a thousand swords!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, knowing the young man was fighting for his life.  This all-out assault meant he could no longer spare any energy for the poisonous mist, and couldn’t last long.</p><p>Once the poison entered his body, there would be no saving him.</p><p>Qin Sang and the two-headed beast roared in unison.  The Netherworld Demon Fire reversed, burning the vegetation, and the two-headed beast fought with all its might, its vertical pupils emitting gusts of wind to fend off the golden ring.</p><p>But the young man's attack was too fierce; even Qin Sang and the two-headed beast couldn't withstand it.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't remain and wait to die. His strength lay in his escape techniques.  Combining talismans with sword energy and thunder, his speed might even surpass the young man’s.</p><p>Seeing the overwhelming attack, Qin Sang recalled the two-headed beast and immediately began to evade, buying time and waiting for the young man to succumb to the poison.</p><p>Qin Sang's strategy proved effective.</p><p>The most ferocious assault failed to kill Qin Sang. The young man's face grew increasingly pale; the poisonous mist had pierced his protective true essence; purplish-red marks spread across his skin, invading his meridians, bringing waves of excruciating pain.</p><p>Finally, the young man could bear it no longer and had to stop, lest he die from the poison before killing Qin Sang.</p><p>The golden ring suddenly halted, and the illusory scene receded like a tide.</p><p>The young man retracted his artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang landed, his breath ragged, his back soaked in sweat. He had survived. The young man's condition was clearly worsening, his desperate gamble having failed, and he was now being consumed by the poison.</p><p>A formidable opponent indeed.  The most challenging he’d ever faced.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could breathe a sigh of relief, he noticed that the gray sword, being withdrawn, unexpectedly changed direction and lunged towards him.</p><p>The gray sword emitted a dazzling green light, its sword energy soaring through the air, majestic and imposing.</p><p>"Why not hurry and dispel the poison? You're already at the end of your rope; what good is this?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the gray sword, questioning the young man’s motive.  As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he sensed something amiss, and suddenly understood, his face turning pale.</p><p>Immediately, his dragon spirit and sword energy manifested, and his figure retreated rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang swept his arm, unleashing the Netherworld Demon Fire without reservation.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The gray sword plunged into the demonic flames.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was anxious, as if he had reached a point of extreme danger.</p><p>The next moment, a green light erupted from the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, shattering it.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A thunderous roar sent ripples through the purple mist.</p><p>The young man, as if struck by lightning, coughed up blood, his face devoid of color, his breath suddenly weak.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He hastily withdrew the Ten Directions Yama Banner, immediately feeling a powerful wave impacting him.  He was thrown back, stumbling as he landed, barely managing to regain his footing.</p><p>He then eagerly summoned the Ten Directions Yama Banner, carefully examining it.  Seeing that it was undamaged, he finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>The explosion had been the young man's decisive self-destruction of his natal spirit sword!</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't been constantly vigilant and possessed exceptional escape techniques, even if he himself could have escaped, one or two parts of the Ten Directions Yama Banner might have been destroyed, making the demonic formation unusable.</p><p>Clearly, the young man hadn't been desperate enough yet. Attempting to escape the Purple Mist wasteland might still have offered a chance.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated such ruthlessness, the self-destruction of his natal spirit sword at this moment!</p><p>A natal treasure is linked to a cultivator's spirit.  Destroying it causes injury, and for cultivators with unique cultivation methods, it can even lead to a drop in realm.</p><p>Once a natal treasure is destroyed, re-refining one requires not only rare materials but also a vast amount of time for nurturing, an immense expenditure of effort for the cultivator.</p><p>The young man took a pill, his breathing stabilizing slightly. His eyes fixed expectantly on Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was only injured, he showed disappointment, then quickly brightened. The Nine Nether Infernal Fire had been scattered by the self-destruction of the grey sword.</p><p>That had been his target.</p><p>His sharp eyes had seen the Ten Directions Yama Banner’s reliance on the Infernal Fire. Without it, Qin Sang would lose his only means of contending with him.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's reaction and speed were too quick, preventing the destruction of the treasure's core.</p><p>Qin Sang also took a pill, suppressing his injuries.  He sneered, pointed at the Ten Directions Yama Banner, and black flames surged as another wave of Nine Nether Infernal Fire erupted.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner contained the core of the Infernal Fire. As long as the banner remained intact, there would be an endless supply of Nine Nether Infernal Fire, regardless of the young man's self-destruction of his treasures.</p><p>Seeing this, the young man's eyes dimmed.  He knew his only chance had been lost, that a counterattack was impossible, and he felt the urge to retreat.</p><p>The young man, decisive as ever, put away his golden ring and fled.</p><p>After a hard-fought battle and the achievement of a hard-won victory, Qin Sang would not let him escape and immediately pursued him.</p>
