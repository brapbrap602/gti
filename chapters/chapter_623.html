Chapter 615: Darkness Dwells, Light Prevails


‘Pitter-patter…’
The rain outside intensified, and the roof began to leak. One drop landed right on Qin Sang’s shoulder.
Ya Gu quickly reached out, shielding Qin Sang, and helped him move. She then took a piece of wood from the fire pit and wrote on the ground, “The first time you saw me, there was no disgust in your eyes.”
Then, Ya Gu looked up at Qin Sang. In the firelight, her eyes shone brightly.
Qin Sang looked at Ya Gu's writing. Her handwriting was elegant. Her grandmother had taught her to read when she was alive. Later, alone and lonely, she practiced calligraphy, remembering her grandmother.
Qin Sang had not learned the local script and language, but he recognized these characters. They were the same as those used in Xiaohan Realm!
Moreover, Qin Sang could easily understand the language spoken by the Qianhu Village natives, though their accent was slightly different from that of Xiaohan Realm.
It was akin to the difference between the official language and regional dialects in his previous life!
This discovery startled Qin Sang.
Even a small area in his past life could develop thousands of languages. How could the vast cultivation world use only one? Could it be that he was still within Xiaohan Realm, unable to escape the clutches of Duke Dongyang?
Qin Sang, who had been somewhat relaxed, immediately tensed up again. He instructed Ya Gu not to meet with outsiders, lest news leak out and increase the risk of exposure.
During this time, only Ya Gu and the old witch doctor had seen him and knew about his missing arm.
The Qianhu Village natives called this place the Western Frontier.
Qin Sang recalled the map of Xiaohan Realm. He didn't remember any place called the Western Frontier.  If going by direction, the western part of Xiaohan Realm was the territory of the Skydemon Hill's demon cultivators, and all the mortals had been relocated.
The Heavenly Alliance was a unified force, with no Western Frontier division.
Qin Sang had also never heard of any place that worshipped a Witch God.
However, mortals' knowledge was limited. He needed to meet cultivators to ascertain his location.
“The first time you saw me, there was no disgust in your eyes.”
Qin Sang sighed inwardly.
He hadn't asked directly, but through their time together and snippets of conversations he’d overheard, he had learned Ya Gu’s story.
Ya Gu would turn sixteen in a few days.
She was from Qianhu Village, and her father, known for his martial prowess, was the bravest warrior in the village. He had been designated to be the next village chief.
But Ya Gu had never lived in the spacious, bright stilt houses of the front village, not even for a day. She had lived in a hut in the back mountain since birth, up until now.
The reason was her title: 'Calamity Star'.
On the day Ya Gu was born, her father, leading a hunting party, was attacked by wild beasts and almost his entire team perished.  Her mother passed away three days after giving birth, following her father.
Coupled with the birthmark on her face, which made her appear fierce, there were rumors in the village that she was the reincarnation of an evil spirit who had cursed her parents to death and would curse the entire village.  She was branded 'Calamity Star' and was to be drowned in the river.
Later, Ya Gu’s only remaining relative, her grandmother, known as 'Grandmother' in the Western Frontier, took Ya Gu away from the village and lived with her in the back mountain, protecting her.
But the misfortune didn't end there.  After Ya Gu turned three, it was discovered she couldn't speak; she was mute. At the age of seven, in another accident, her grandmother also died, right in front of her.
Since then, the title of 'Calamity Star' had stuck to Ya Gu, and everyone called her Ya Gu. No one knew her real name.
Although no one had died because of Ya Gu in the past ten years, the people of Qianhu Village still wouldn't allow her to return.  The seven-year-old Ya Gu had lived alone in the back mountain ever since.
It was hard to imagine how a seven-year-old child had endured.
Fortunately, there were no wild beasts on the mountain where Qianhu Village was located. The village arranged for people to patrol the river below the mountain day and night by boat, and the back mountain was safe.
Also, the elders in the village were reasonable.  Remembering the past contributions of Ya Gu’s family, they often helped her, especially the witch doctor grandfather, who had some connection with Ya Gu’s grandmother and cared for her the most.
But they didn’t dare go against the villagers' anger and bring Ya Gu back to the village.
Despite experiencing so much hardship, Ya Gu held no resentment in her heart. Her eyes were so clear and pure.
She didn’t resign herself to her fate. She became self-reliant. From the age of twelve, she supported herself through labor and weaving bamboo wares, refusing charity.
Having seen countless people, Qin Sang saw the innocence and naivety that still resided in Ya Gu’s heart. She longed for acceptance, for companionship.  That’s why, even when those girls spoke ill of her, she still desired to be close to them.
The words written on the ground expressed Ya Gu's true feelings.
She saw hope of acceptance in Qin Sang.
Looking into Ya Gu’s hopeful and trusting eyes, Qin Sang couldn’t bear to say much.
Ya Gu didn't know that although he looked young, he was a cultivator over a hundred years old, who had seen countless real evil spirits. He wouldn't be scared by a mere birthmark.
Qin Sang was long past the age of judging by appearances.
What skin, no matter how beautiful, could compare to the true forms of Chen Yan and Granny Jing?
And what ugliness could match the ugliness of the human heart?
In his eyes, Ya Gu was more beautiful than those with pretty faces. Such a good girl deserved to be blessed by heaven.
"Everything will be alright!"
Qin Sang said.
…
The mortal herbs had no effect on his injuries, but Qin Sang couldn't refuse Ya Gu’s kindness, so he drank them all.
After he finished the herbal concoction, Ya Gu helped him to the inner room to rest. She then returned to weave bamboo wares by the firelight. The Witch God Festival was approaching, and she wanted to make as many as possible.
Through the thin curtain, Qin Sang saw Ya Gu’s slender figure busy by the fire pit.
A moment later, Qin Sang closed his eyes and entered a meditative state.
The rain fell all night and gradually stopped near dawn, leaving only a light drizzle.
Suddenly, Qin Sang, who seemed to be asleep in bed, opened his eyes. A hint of surprise flashed in them. He had thought it would take two more days, but his recovery was faster than expected. A sliver of his divine sense had returned.
"I should be able to open the Qianjun Ring!"
Qin Sang carefully controlled that sliver of divine sense, touched the Qianjun Ring, finally opened it, and quickly retrieved a few items before his divine sense was exhausted again.
A needle-like pain shot through his head.
Enduring the pain, Qin Sang fumbled for a jade bottle containing spirit pills that aided in the recovery of divine sense.  He eagerly opened it, popped a few pills into his mouth, and the pain subsided significantly.
After meditating for an hour, another sliver of his divine sense returned. Qin Sang opened the Corpse Puppet Pouch and summoned the transformed Flying Night Fiend.
He finally felt at ease.
The Flying Night Fiend’s appearance had changed drastically. It looked like the most ferocious evil spirit.  Its skin had turned black, gleaming with a metallic sheen, like cast iron, and contained terrifying power.
This was the true Flying Night Fiend!
