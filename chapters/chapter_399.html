Chapter 392: The Power of the Magical Artifact


A magical artifact!
It’s actually a magical artifact!


Yu Hua’s cultivation is at most at the False Core Realm; this is undeniable. Yet, he can now control those main souls to raise the true Ten Directions Yama Banner. The banner flutters, emitting a rustling sound, and black flames roll, clearly showing the activated power of the artifact.

It turns out that by utilizing the power of the Ten Directions Yama Formation, Foundation Establishment cultivators can use magical artifacts!


It’s common knowledge that one cannot wield a magical artifact without reaching the Golden Core stage. Only in rare exceptional cases, such as the “Meta-Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter”, can this ironclad rule be broken.


Qin Sang hadn't considered this possibility before.


The genuine Ten Directions Yama Banners refined by the Kui Yin Patriarch, only five remain in existence. Even within the Kui Yin Sect, these artifacts are mostly controlled by Golden Core cultivators; few know this secret, and even fewer can use it.

Liang Yan's cultivation and status were not high, so he didn't have the clearance to know such secrets; he was evidently unaware.


Sun De might have known, but when Qin Sang dealt with him, he didn’t yet know the "Soul Seizing Curse."  Back then, Qin Sang was weak and had to tread carefully, daring not risk keeping Sun De alive; otherwise, it would be like playing with fire. Sun De clearly wasn't telling the truth and was hiding many secrets.


The method of refining the Ten Directions Yama Banner artifact was passed down by the Kui Yin Patriarch, and it has a close relationship with the Ten Directions Yama Banner itself.  Using the Ten Directions Yama Formation, finding an alternative path to wield the artifact is this formation's greatest power!


This Ten Directions Yama Banner artifact should be the one Zhao Yan left in the clam shell at the bottom of the lake on Yuanzhao Peak, which was used to trap that Yuanzhao Sect Foundation Establishment disciple guarding the Nine Illusory Heavenly Orchid.


At the time, although Qin Sang coveted the artifact, he dared not take it, for releasing the trapped person would certainly lead to his death.  He could only leave with regret.


It seems that Yu Hua must have returned to the lake bottom later, taking the artifact during the chaos.  This man is not simple; seeing the Kui Yin Sect destroyed, he clearly had the intention of seizing the treasure, relentlessly searching for Zhao Yan in order to steal the Nine Illusory Heavenly Orchid.  Even if Zhao Yan hadn't been killed by his own doing, he would have died at Yu Hua's hands.


Qin Sang secretly rejoiced. Fortunately, his disguise misled Yu Hua, and Yu Hua never imagined that someone could ignore the threat of the heart-eating insect Gu; he didn't suspect Qin Sang at all. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.


……


Yu Hua's figure emerged from behind the main souls. His face was exceptionally pale, the pallor of severe blood loss, yet he wore a cruel smile and a murderous intent.


“Forcing me to expend my lifeblood and use a magical artifact, you have every reason to be proud! Hand over the Nine Illusory Heavenly Orchid, and I’ll grant you a quick death. Otherwise, you'll enter the Yama Banner and taste the torment of a thousand ghosts devouring your soul!”


Qin Sang clenched his fists, coldly watching Yu Hua. He had long known Yu Hua's goal. If it weren’t for the fear of not finding the Nine Illusory Heavenly Orchid after his death, Yu Hua would have already activated the heart-eating insect Gu and struck him down.


As if he hadn't heard Yu Hua's threat, Qin Sang’s mind raced, pondering something.


Magical artifact…
Life blood…


Qin Sang’s gaze shifted, fixed on the Ten Directions Yama Banner artifact.  The artifact released rolling black flames from its surface, far deeper and purer than the ghostfire created by the Yin soul threads.  The sight sent a wave of fear through Qin Sang, shocking him.


He didn't know what kind of flame this black fire was, but its power was undoubtedly terrifying.


The following scene confirmed Qin Sang’s guess. Yu Hua gestured, sending a stream of black flames downward. Like an arrow, it easily pierced the thunderous magma and surged towards the Flying Horned Dragon. The power of the black flames only slightly diminished.


The Flying Horned Dragons sensed the danger from the black flames and immediately panicked, emitting terrified screams. They even abandoned their attack on the intruders who had entered their lair and fled into the deep pool.


For a moment, the scene was utterly chaotic. These ancient beasts had sharp senses, and their reaction indirectly demonstrated the black flames' terror.


Yu Hua had great confidence in the artifact. Without looking at the situation below, he seemed certain that the black flames would drive back the Flying Horned Dragons, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang.


Giving Qin Sang no chance to breathe, Yu Hua immediately launched the remaining black flames.


‘Whoosh…’


The surface of the artifact banner violently vibrated. The strange black flames, seemingly slow but actually fast, swept over with a chilling aura, a kind of cold that could freeze a person's primordial spirit, like the demonic flames of the Nine Netherworlds!


Qin Sang couldn’t help but shiver.


‘Hiss…’


When the black flames collided with Qin Sang’s Yin soul threads, a shocking scene occurred.


The powerful soul threads, like cotton encountering a fierce flame, offered no resistance.  The black flames easily ignited and consumed them.

The black flames swept through, destroying the soul threads with devastating ease.  Qin Sang hastily gathered the remaining threads, desperately focusing his power to create a shield of black fire against the onslaught.

The black fire conjured by the Ten Directions Yama Array resembled the black flames from the magical artifact, likely sharing a common origin, yet the difference between them was vast.

Despite Qin Sang’s best efforts, he was forced back, inch by inch.  Then, he heard a buzzing from the Ten Directions Yama Array.  Looking closer, he saw the ghostly banners trembling, their dark energy dissipating, threatening the array’s collapse.

If the black flames breached the array, it would be destroyed instantly!

Qin Sang's face paled, his heart pounding with terror.  He had no time to think, immediately activating his talisman-artifact.

The silver blade flashed brilliantly. Qin Sang poured the talisman's remaining power into a blinding, desperate attack on the black flames, burning with its last reserves.

The talisman bore the brunt of the flames.

For a brief moment, the pressure on the Ten Directions Yama Array lessened.  But the respite was fleeting, as the silver blade talisman, already weak, was swiftly consumed by the black flames.

Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang instantly retracted the Ten Directions Yama Array and the living corpses.  Simultaneously, the dragon from his dantian emerged, draining his remaining spiritual energy to activate the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot talisman as he fled.

"A talisman-artifact?" Yu Hua frowned, surprised that Qin Sang possessed such an item, allowing him to escape the artifact's suppression. He felt a surge of relief, glad he’d acted swiftly, unleashing his artifact without hesitation, preventing Qin Sang from gaining the upper hand.  Otherwise, while he could summon the Heart-Eating Insect Gu to kill Qin Sang at any time, the lead on the Nine Illusory Heavenly Orchid would likely be lost.

"Hmm? This is an Upper Yuan Quiet Palace seal?"  Seeing the dragon spirit glowing on Qin Sang, Yu Hua recognized the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot talisman, muttering, "Killing Zhao Yan, then joining the Upper Yuan Quiet Palace... possessing such treasures... it seems he holds a high position. Our Kui Yin Sect has truly produced a remarkable talent…"

Yu Hua snorted coldly.

The black flames surged, engulfing the silver blade talisman.  Yu Hua didn't retract his artifact; instead, he enveloped the Ten Directions Yama Array and pursued.
