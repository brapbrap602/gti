<h1>Chapter 1868: The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons</h1><p>Two Demonic King Avatars materialized. One was a ferocious Earth-Armored Dragon, the other humanoid, its body flickering with crimson light, a figure of pure fire, like a fiend walked from the inferno itself.</p><p>As the two sides clashed, the Demonic Kings silently channeled their avatars, linking them to a nearby illusionary realm.</p><p>That illusionary realm was a world of fire. Rivers of magma crisscrossed the land, radiating intense heat. The ground was strewn with black rocks, gleaming with a metallic sheen, hardened over eons by the tempering flames.</p><p>Countless flames danced in the void, omnipresent.</p><p>A sea of fire reached the heavens, incinerating the eight desolate corners of the world!</p><p>The Demonic Kings’ target was this very realm. The Earth-Armored Dragon pried at the earth and rock, while the Fire Spirit gathered the flowing flames of the sky.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A crimson hurricane erupted within the illusionary realm.</p><p>The wind of fire continuously absorbed the surrounding flames, deepening in color and growing in intensity.</p><p>At the same time, a rumbling echoed from the earth, the ground splitting open, ravines crisscrossing, and boulders soaring into the air.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The wind of fire swept over, engulfing the boulders. Sounds of collisions reverberated within the flames.</p><p>Rocks pierced the sky, streams of fire shot out in all directions.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, the fire and black stone underwent a bizarre transformation, their essence extracted, their impurities purged. The fire and earth energies within the illusionary realm were channeled by the two Demonic Kings.</p><p>Soon, a massive black stone, ablaze with flames, appeared, suspended in mid-air.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The giant stone trembled slightly, causing the entire illusionary space to violently shake.</p><p>As the chaos intensified, the giant stone finally moved, erupting with extreme speed, shooting out of the illusionary realm.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The barrier between the illusionary realms was pierced.</p><p>The adjacent illusionary realm was a pitch-black void. A massive meteorite crashed in, shattering the silence, dyeing half the sky with firelight, a dazzling crimson glow.</p><p>The flaming boulder, like a comet, trailed a long tail as it flew through the void, leaving behind a crimson scar in the heavens, lingering for a long time.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The flaming boulder pierced through one illusionary realm after another, drawing closer and closer to the battlefield.</p><p>The two Demonic King Avatars retreated to the edge of the battlefield, slightly tilting their heads upwards, gazing in the direction of the incoming flaming boulder. Divine light erupted from both their bodies, merging together, their auras constantly rising, their eyes gleaming with excitement and bloodthirsty ferocity.</p><p>The Immortal Sect side sensed something amiss and tried to interrupt the two Demonic Kings' divine ability, but it was too late.</p><p>The demon cultivators, noticing the Immortal Sect's battle formation attempting to move towards the two Demonic Kings, desperately tried to block them.</p><p>“There! What is that thing?”</p><p>An Immortal Sect True Master looked up, saw the sky dyed crimson, faintly discerned a scarlet rainbow, and felt a great shock in his heart. His expression changed drastically, and he cried out in alarm.</p><p>More and more True Masters noticed the anomaly. Everyone felt the suffocating, terrifying power.</p><p>The three Grand True Masters' faces were now ashen.</p><p>The old Daoist remained calm and collected amidst the crisis. He reached into his robes, retrieved a gleaming golden rope, and secretly transmitted a message to the other Grand True Masters, preparing to throw the golden rope.</p><p>At this critical juncture, the auspicious clouds experienced an unprecedented, violent tremor.</p><p>This tremor was not only intense but also carried a peculiar fluctuation, emanating from the center of the auspicious clouds.</p><p>On the battlefield, even the lowest-ranked demon soldiers could sense the unusual nature of this fluctuation.</p><p>For a moment, all eyes were drawn to the auspicious clouds.</p><p>The White-Robed Demonic King had advanced another ten zhang, but it didn't obstruct everyone’s view, as the auspicious clouds had become extremely thin during the tremors.</p><p>The Imperial Decree had vanished. The White-Robed Demonic King stared intently into the depths of the auspicious clouds, indifferent to the gazes behind him.</p><p>His gaze was fixed on the source of the tremors, where a five-colored vortex had appeared.</p><p>The vortex churned the clouds, initially minuscule, but expanding rapidly. Half of the Imperial Decree was at its center, sinking deeper into the vortex moments later.</p><p>This fluctuation was clearly related to the Divine Court, originating from the depths of the vortex.</p><p>The White-Robed Demonic King, having seemingly discovered some secret, appeared to have opened a passage to the Divine Court.</p><p>The demon cultivators of the Ghost Fang Kingdom were ecstatic, while the Immortal Sect True Masters' expressions changed dramatically.</p><p>To make matters worse, the meteorite had appeared within the True Masters’ field of vision. Heavenly might descended, hurtling straight towards them.</p><p>The True Masters could already imagine the gruesome scene of being struck by the flaming boulder.</p><p>However, compared to the meteorite, the more urgent matter was breaking through the demon formation and stopping the White-Robed Demonic King from entering the Divine Court first.</p><p>Should the Divine Court fall into the hands of demons, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p><p>Unable to handle both threats simultaneously, the True Masters were filled with anxiety, all looking towards the old Daoist.</p><p>The old Daoist’s movements stiffened slightly, his expression shifting several times. He unexpectedly returned the golden rope to his robes and retrieved a small seal instead.</p><p>This seal was carved from black jade, one cun and two fen square, small and exquisite, yet emanating an ancient aura, seemingly a divine seal from antiquity.</p><p>Several prominent cracks marred the surface of the divine seal, but the seal itself remained intact.</p><p>With a flick of the old Daoist’s wrist, the treasured seal flew up, allowing the cultivators to see the characters inscribed on its surface.</p><p>"North Pole Supervisory Execution Divine Seal!"</p><p>A Demonic King exclaimed upon recognizing the inscription, a flicker of fear flashing in his eyes.</p><p>This fear wasn't true terror, but an instinctive reaction, stemming from his ancestors.</p><p>This Demonic King’s ancestors were once Ghost Gods under the command of the Dao Court, belonging to the Fengdu Underworld, under the jurisdiction of the North Pole Exorcism Court.</p><p>As its name implied, the North Pole Supervisory Execution Divine Seal held the power to subdue the Ghost Gods of both the Yin and Yang Divisions. Holding this seal granted the authority to monitor the merits and demerits of Ghost Gods and control their life and death.  All Ghost Gods were in awe of it.</p><p>After countless years, the descendants of the Ghost Gods had long since separated from the Dao Court, but the fear of this divine seal remained within their bloodline.</p><p>This seal was still preserved within the Dao Court, seemingly relatively intact, its power possibly not much diminished.</p><p>While surprised, the demons were also puzzled. Among the Demonic Kings who had entered the Governance Platform, none cultivated the Divine Dao.</p><p>The current generation of Divine Dao demon cultivators practiced Divine Dao techniques independently developed by the Ghost Fang Kingdom. Although derived from the Dao Court's Ghost God Dao, they were different and might not be suppressed by this divine seal.</p><p>What was the old Daoist's intention in retrieving this seal?</p><p>The demons didn't remain puzzled for long.</p><p>The old Daoist raised the North Pole Supervisory Execution Divine Seal but did not activate it. With a flick of his sleeve, he retrieved another item, a yellow scroll.</p><p>The yellow scroll slowly unfurled.</p><p>Primordial Yellow light diffused, as heavy as the earth itself.  At the center of the Primordial Yellow light, a black qi emerged, radiating a chilling coldness, like Yin Qi drawn from the Nine Netherworlds.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The yellow scroll fully opened, slightly smaller than the Governance Platform beneath the old Daoist’s feet, its shape irregular, like a fragment torn from a larger piece of cloth.</p><p>‘Whooosh… Whooosh… Whooosh…’</p><p>Yin wind howled, and all the cultivators on the battlefield felt a bone-chilling cold.</p><p>“Could this be?”</p><p>A Demonic King recognized something, his face revealing shock. The other Demonic Kings quickly understood as well.</p><p>Exclamations immediately arose, “The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons Pictorial Record! It’s the Yin Heaven Palace’s fragment of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons!”</p><p>With the exclamations, the Primordial Yellow Qi within the yellow scroll suddenly spread rapidly, causing the scroll to expand. The small yellow scroll seemed boundless.</p><p>In an instant, the sky above the cultivators was filled with an endless expanse of Primordial Yellow Qi.</p><p>The cultivators felt as though they were beneath a vast Primordial Yellow earth, their hearts filled with awe.</p><p>Amidst the Primordial Yellow, the Yin Qi persisted, expanding along with the yellow scroll.</p><p>The Yin Qi rolled and churned, dense and unyielding, like a mountain on the Primordial Yellow earth.</p><p>Within the Yin Qi, there indeed was a mountain, emitting cries of ghosts and strange howls, as if ten thousand ghosts resided within.</p><p>This mountain was a Heavenly Prison!</p><p>This yellow scroll was the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons Pictorial Record refined by the Hou Tu Celestial Master in ancient times for the development of the Divine Dao. It captured demons and ghosts, refining them into ghost soldiers, testing their merits and demerits. Those willing to submit were merged with divine power and bestowed the title of Ghost God.</p><p>However, now, it wasn't even a complete fragment, merely a shard, obtained by the ancestor of the Yin Heaven Palace. This ancestor founded the Yin Heaven Palace and based on this fragment, created a new technique for the sect—the North Emperor Demon Subduing Secret Art.</p><p>But limited by cultivation, the North Emperor Demon Subduing Secret Art had only reached the third stage.</p><p>The North Emperor Demon Subduing Secret Art connected to the fragment of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons, not the Divine Court. Therefore, the Yin Heaven Palace was the most unique existence within the Immortal Sects. And because it was a fragment, it had limitations.</p><p>The fragment contained Heavenly Prisons, capable of holding ghost soldiers, and also contained Talisman Deities left by ancient mighty figures.</p><p>In ancient times, when Fengdu connected with the Divine Court, the Divine Dao wasn’t the only power. Within Fengdu, both Ghost Gods and Talisman Deities coexisted.</p><p>The Yin Heaven Palace selected some ghost soldiers, merging them with some Talisman Deities, transforming them into Ghost Gods.</p><p>Ghost Gods commanded ghost soldiers and obeyed the commands of the Yin Heaven Palace True Masters.</p><p>Yin Heaven Palace cultivators had an advantage over other Immortal Sect cultivators: they could perform the art of summoning spirits and deities, commanding the Talisman Deities within the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons Pictorial Record for their own use.</p><p>The Yin Heaven Palace established its sect in Ju Shan Zhi, rooted in the Yellow Springs Path, precisely to capture demonic beasts on the battlefield, replenish the Heavenly Prisons, and train ghost soldiers.</p><p>In a sense, the fragment of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons was also a treasure for amassing troops.</p><p>Within the Governance Platform, the environment was unique, preventing the use of extremely powerful treasures.  The fragment of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons could be utilized effectively. The Dao Court had secretly borrowed this treasure and brought it into the Governance Platform!</p><p>The Heavenly Prison manifested!</p><p>Overwhelming Yin Qi, echoing ghostly wails, instilled fear and trepidation.</p><p>The wails grew increasingly sharp and piercing.</p><p>Because it was only a fragment, the Heavenly Prison’s foundation was unstable. The Yin Heaven Palace had established a grand formation in Crane Cry Mountain, placing the fragment within the formation to stabilize the Heavenly Prison.</p><p>Now, brought into the Governance Platform, the ghost soldiers felt the restraining force weaken.  Some of the more ferocious ones began to stir.</p><p>Even those ghost commanders who had already submitted to the Yin Heaven Palace and been bestowed titles had ulterior motives. They appeared above the Heavenly Prison, exchanged glances, and looked up beyond the prison.</p><p>Some eyes gleamed, others hesitated, but ultimately they allowed the ghost soldiers to clamor, making no attempt to restrain them, letting the chaos spread.</p><p>However, they were also bound by the Heavenly Prison, unable to easily escape, and prepared to wait and see.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The old Daoist saw through their intentions. With a flick of his dust whisk, the North Pole Supervisory Execution Divine Seal transformed into a beam of light, shooting towards the Heavenly Prison.</p><p>The next moment, the Ghost Gods felt an inexplicable chill, then saw six crimson characters appear above the Heavenly Prison.</p><p>It was the North Pole Supervisory Execution Divine Seal!</p><p>They couldn't see the entire seal, only the inscription. The six characters seemed dyed in blood, exuding a terrifying, ferocious aura, descending from the heavens.</p><p>The Ghost Gods were terrified, feeling that being touched by the inscription would obliterate their souls.</p><p>In their fright, they prostrated themselves, trembling, daring not to harbor any wicked thoughts.</p><p>“By decree of the North Emperor, descend and obey.</p><p>You ghost soldiers, reveal yourselves!”</p><p>The old Daoist roared.</p><p>“Obeying the decree!”</p><p>The Ghost Gods kowtowed, rose, looked towards the Heavenly Prison, and waved their tokens.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The prison gates opened, waves of black qi surged out, and the ghostly wails intensified several times over.</p><p>The Ghost Gods were enraged, glaring at the troublesome ghost soldiers, and fiercely lashed out with their whips.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack! Crack!’</p><p>A chorus of ghostly wails and howls, all the clamor abruptly ceased.  They formed orderly ranks and, at the old Daoist’s command, charged out of the Heavenly Prison.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>“Hee hee hee hee…”</p><p>Strange cries resounded continuously.  Though called ghost soldiers, most were ferocious beasts and demon cultivators of the Ghost Fang Kingdom captured by the Yin Heaven Palace over the years. Confined within the Heavenly Prison for so long, their nature had changed, becoming even more bloodthirsty.</p><p>The Ghost Gods led the ghost soldiers, charging towards the enemy, and immediately engaged in a frenzied slaughter.</p><p>The old Daoist’s movements didn't stop. He looked up at the fragment of the Heavenly Prisons, made hand seals, stepped on the Heavenly Gang positions, and chanted.</p><p>“Eastern Mountain Divine Incantation, summon the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Crimson script decree, control Fengdu Mountain.</p><p>Bind demons and dispatch ghosts, utterly destroy them all.</p><p>Gather at the Wooden Palace, dare not delay!”</p><p>Finishing the incantation, the old Daoist flicked his dust whisk towards the east.</p><p>With the sound of the incantation, the Primordial Yellow Qi within the fragment of the Heavenly Prisons fluctuated. Where the Qi gathered, figures seemed to appear.</p><p>The next moment, beams of golden light shot out from the Primordial Yellow Qi, towards the direction indicated by the old Daoist’s dust whisk.</p><p>‘Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!’</p><p>Golden light descended from the heavens, landing upon the heads of the eastern troops. Faintly visible within each beam of golden light was the illusory figure of a Talisman Deity.</p><p>The Talisman Deities were mindless, like statues in temples, their postures and expressions varied.</p><p>Their appearances weren't necessarily humanoid.  There were majestic deities with three heads and six arms, and also strange, ferocious deities with menacing appearances.</p><p>The incantation chanted by the old Daoist was called the Lingbao Crimson Script Secret Text Ghost Incantation, an art for summoning Talisman Deities, passed down from ancient times within the North Pole Exorcism Court, primarily for commanding the Talisman Deities of Fengdu.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>As the Talisman Deities descended, they transformed into golden light, engulfing the troops.</p><p>In an instant, all the troops were clad in golden armor, feeling an influx of boundless divine power, roaring repeatedly, their aura surging!</p><p>Empowered by the Talisman Deities, their strength was transformed.</p><p>“Crimson script commands spirits, North commands Fengdu Mountain.</p><p>Bind and dispatch the demonic sects, sever the roots of evil.</p><p>The Talisman teachings prosecute, clearly listing the crimes.</p><p>Southern Mountain Divine Incantation, subdue all directions.</p><p>All demons annihilated, utterly destroyed!”</p><p>The old Daoist stepped on the Heavenly Gang and Dipper positions, the chanting continued, his dust whisk flicked towards the south.</p><p>“Crimson script jade characters, Nine Heavens true text.</p><p>Summon all spirits, universally return to the Emperor.”</p><p>The dust whisk pointed towards the west.</p><p>“Northern Mountain Divine Incantation, incite Yang and raise thunder.</p><p>Flowing bells descend, shaking the heavens, suppressing with might.</p><p>North Fengdu’s legions, annihilate all demons.”</p><p>When the northern troops were also bathed in golden light, almost all the True Masters' troops had received divine empowerment.</p><p>Golden light soared into the sky above the battlefield, as if the demon soldiers had become true divine soldiers.</p><p>The so-called summoning of celestial deities wasn't simply an infusion of divine power. The demon soldiers, imbued with the power of the Talisman Deities, were involuntarily guided by the divine power, even abandoning their instincts, allowing the True Masters to command them with perfect control.</p><p>The coordination between the troops reached a seamless level, and with the aid of the Talisman Deities, they could unleash powerful Dao techniques exceeding their own capabilities.</p><p>“By decree of the North Emperor, open the Ghost Gate.</p><p>Exterminate inauspiciousness, let none stand before us!”</p><p>The old Daoist glared, his voice booming like thunder, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>All the troops roared in response!</p>
