<h1>Chapter 1952 The Abyss</h1><p>Qin Sang wandered through a sea of stars, drawing the constellations into his cave.</p><p>The starlight was actually sword energy forming star-shaped swords.</p><p>These sword-stars were constantly changing, unpredictable, arranging themselves into various formations.</p><p>The gathering and scattering of the stars represented Qin Sang's deduction of the Southern Seven Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>In this star sea, one point of red light was the most dazzling – a cluster of blazing flames.</p><p>This flame was currently shapeless, in its nascent form.</p><p>However, within the flames was a Vermillion Bird, poised to take flight, manipulating the true fire, coordinating with the changing sword-stars.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to use the Vermillion Bird to comprehend the Southern Seven Mansions Sword Formation.  It proved incredibly difficult, but his recent deductions had given him a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Normally, Qin Sang would use his understanding of the sword path to deduce the formation, at least constructing its basic structure, cultivating a unique sword intent, and finally transforming this intent into a Vermillion Bird凶煞 .</p><p>Now, a real Vermillion Bird could replace the凶煞, and Qin Sang, using the Seven Mansions' division sword formation as a reference, could deduce the formation. By finding the point of convergence, he could achieve fusion between the bird and the formation.</p><p>Then, to a certain extent, it could be considered a formation spirit!</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure if this idea would succeed.</p><p>He hoped for a successful start; otherwise, comprehending the other two Four Symbols Sword Formations would be even harder.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword light suddenly disappeared.</p><p>“This Vermillion Bird is done for!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, complaining. Before Qin Sang could speak, it tilted its head and fell asleep. It was truly exhausted, completely worn out from cooperating with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly reflected on the insights gained from his deduction. After a while, he left the cave.</p><p>…</p><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>Fu Xiao was at his wit's end. Luckily, the terrain here favored him, allowing him to narrowly escape several near-fatal attacks.</p><p>But would this place help him escape his enemies?</p><p>Fu Xiao wryly smiled to himself; he feared he had less than a 10% chance.</p><p>But his will to survive remained undiminished. Cultivators who reach the Nascent Soul stage are all strong of spirit.</p><p>Surrounded by magma, the temperature felt increasingly lower, and a chilling aura gradually spread.</p><p>Behind him, the green fire was catching up again.</p><p>Fu Xiao squeezed the object in his palm, his body suddenly plummeting deeper into the magma.</p><p>As expected, his pursuers immediately reacted.</p><p>The tall man suddenly spat out a mouthful of foul blood, falling into the green fire. The fire surged, and more than a dozen black chains shot out.</p><p>At the end of each chain was a head engulfed in green flames, its expression ferocious, its eyes replaced by green fire, emitting the howls of a devil.</p><p>These grotesque heads moved through the magma without hindrance, instantly catching up to Fu Xiao, surrounding him in a chaotic dance.</p><p>The heads shrieked, opening their gaping maws and lunging at Fu Xiao.</p><p>Fu Xiao seemed truly exhausted, only managing to throw out a fiery jade bracelet. The bracelet expanded into a fiery ring, but instead of repelling the heads, it only lasted a moment before being shattered.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The sound of breaking was sharp.</p><p>The heads fell upon Fu Xiao, tearing at his flesh.</p><p>Simultaneously, in the lower layer of magma, Fu Xiao's figure appeared, his breath ragged. He forcefully circulated his true essence, striking downwards with his palm.</p><p>Where he struck, an unusual light flickered.</p><p>Within the light, a dilapidated palace emerged.</p><p>The palace, long deserted, was silent and desolate, giving a dilapidated impression.</p><p>Yet, the patterns on the palace walls were still vibrant, depicting various fire beasts.</p><p>These fire beasts were lifelike, surrounding a fire phoenix. Their positions held a hidden meaning, like a grand formation.</p><p>Some fire beasts were particularly striking, seeming to burn with flames, about to step off the wall.</p><p>Not all the beasts were so; many had lost their luster, but the condition was better than Fu Xiao had expected.</p><p>Fu Xiao's face lit up. He immediately took out a bronze mirror, shone it on the fire phoenix at the center of the beasts, muttering incantations, sucking the phoenix into the mirror. Then, gathering all his strength, he threw the mirror.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The fire phoenix burst from the mirror, soaring majestically through the magma.</p><p>The palace exploded simultaneously.</p><p>Amidst the palace fragments, red streams of light shot out, transforming into spectral fire beasts. Drawn to the fire phoenix, they surrounded it, mirroring the patterns on the wall.</p><p>However, the "Beast Image" came alive at that moment.</p><p>Roars erupted one after another.</p><p>The beasts surrounded the fire phoenix, circling it faster and faster, as if all the fire beasts were caught in a vortex of flames, a terrifying aura brewing rapidly.</p><p>At this time, the tall man realized he'd been tricked. The flesh and blood torn from the heads had turned into pieces of dry wood.</p><p>He snorted coldly, about to cast a spell to capture Fu Xiao, when he suddenly felt something, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>A tremendous explosion occurred below, followed by an astonishing surge of fire elemental energy.</p><p>The scene was like an eruption of underground magma veins, but even more powerful and destructive!</p><p>The tall man was the first to bear the brunt. By the time he noticed anything amiss, the crimson torrent was almost upon him.</p><p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p><p>The tall man, without flinching, quickly recalled the heads, the iron chains weaving a net around him.</p><p>At the same time, green fire erupted from every pore of his body, transforming into a thick fire armor that protected his entire body.</p><p>Almost the instant the fire armor formed, the tall man was swallowed by the torrent.</p><p>The next moment, the power of the fire beast formation completely exploded.</p><p>From above, one could see the surrounding magma and mountains violently shaking, bulging upwards before erupting in a torrent of incandescent magma, filling the entire sky.</p><p>The magma continued to erupt, the crimson torrent reaching towards the heavens, far larger than any mountain.</p><p>Amidst the terrifying scene created by the fire beast formation, the tall man could no longer maintain his footing.</p><p>The heads and chains finally couldn't hold, making cracking sounds as they shattered piece by piece.</p><p>However, this fire beast formation was not enough to kill the tall man.</p><p>Green fire continuously surged from within him. He put on a pair of obsidian gloves and repeatedly struck with his palms, using his physical strength to resist the torrent, and slowly began to regain his footing.</p><p>His eyes were deep and piercing, searching for something within the fiery torrent.</p><p>Suddenly, his brow furrowed, a strange unease washing over him.</p><p>Soon, the unease was confirmed. He felt his internal energy flow strangely obstructed, a slight discordance, as if he'd been poisoned.</p><p>"Poison?"</p><p>Since joining the Luohun Abyss and becoming a corpse cultivator, immune to all poisons, he hadn't felt this in a long time.</p><p>At that moment, a mocking voice suddenly rang out in his ear.</p><p>"Didn't that old corpse demon teach you the lesson of not pursuing a defeated foe?"</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>The tall man was startled, catching a glimpse of a figure to his left, instantly recognizing Ling Shi.  "It's you!"</p><p>"And this Marquis! We invite you, friend, to return to our residence for a chat!"</p><p>A figure appeared on his right, approaching rapidly, flanking him.</p><p>The tall man's heart sank.</p><p>...</p><p>After activating the fire beast formation, Fu Xiao used the chaos created by the torrent to conceal himself, fleeing desperately beneath the magma, hoping that the formation would buy him some time.</p><p>He was truly exhausted, doing all he could, leaving the rest to fate; a faint sense of despair filled his heart.</p><p>After escaping a distance.</p><p>Fu Xiao couldn't help but look back. Behind him was chaos; he couldn't sense anything. He was only concerned about the corpse demon – it hadn't pursued him!</p><p>"The weakened formation actually trapped the corpse demon!"</p><p>Fu Xiao, surviving the ordeal, couldn't contain his elation, fleeing while silently thanking the ancestral master of the Liuhe Sect.</p><p>Shortly after his escape.</p><p>The magma in the sky gradually subsided, and two figures burst from the flames.</p><p>Gui Hou carried a person, the now powerless tall man.</p><p>Their combined ambush, coupled with the poison, resulted in a swift victory.</p><p>...</p><p>The dojo.</p><p>Gui Hou returned with the tall man and received orders to take him to the fire chamber.</p><p>"Reporting to Master, the man is here. During interrogation, he revealed a partner hiding elsewhere. Daoist Ling Shi has gone to capture him."</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged atop the bronze pillar, his Huiying Sword floating before him, being refined with his essence blood.</p><p>Gui Hou stood quietly beside him.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang stopped the refinement and looked at the tall man lying prostrate.</p><p>The man's five senses had not been sealed; seeing Qin Sang and the fire chamber's setup, he was shocked.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't see the reaction he wanted.</p><p>Without any movement from Qin Sang, an object flew from the tall man's chest – a crimson jade pendant, the Yanxin Jade.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Yanxin Jade. From this pendant, he sensed a familiar energy, the same as the bronze pillar!</p><p>That's why he'd decided on the spur of the moment to have Gui Hou bring the man here.</p><p>One could see from this man's behavior that he didn't recognize the bronze pillar.</p><p>"Where did the jade disc come from?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked calmly.</p><p>Gui Hou released the tall man from his restraints, whispering a threat, "Friend, you're a smart one.  It's best to know when to yield.  If our master uses the soul-searching technique, you'll regret it."</p><p>In fact, the tall man had no intention of resisting.</p><p>Seeing Gui Hou's respectful demeanor towards Qin Sang, addressing him as "master," a terrifying thought struck him, filling him with dread.</p><p>"I… I reply, senior. The Yanxin Jade was a gift from the ancestor.  Lord Feiluo led us to infiltrate the Fire Domain to find something that would react with the jade disc…"</p><p>The tall man revealed everything without reservation.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He subtly activated the Fire Chamber spirit array, leaking a trace of the bronze pillar's energy, and the Yanxin Jade glowed.</p><p>The tall man's eyes widened.  The ruins they had found didn't contain such a pillar. The jade's reaction reminded him of an event from two hundred years ago.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed an anomaly.</p><p>Before he could investigate further, the Yanxin Jade shattered with a crack, but Qin Sang acted faster, instantly sealing its core.</p><p>"It's a forgery!"</p><p>The creator of the Yanxin Jade was extremely cautious, planting a hidden mechanism, but it also allowed Qin Sang to discern certain things.</p><p>The genuine Yanxin Jade and the bronze pillar clearly shared a common origin, likely a crucial component.</p><p>"What is the origin of these objects, and what is the Luohun Abyss ancestor searching for them?"</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed the secret of the pillar was lost to history.</p><p>He glanced at the tall man. The Luohun Abyss ancestor certainly wouldn't reveal the true secret to them; he couldn't extract any valuable information.</p><p>After inquiring about the other ruins, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then waved his hand.  "Take him away."</p><p>Gui Hou bowed and retreated from the Fire Chamber.</p><p>…</p><p>Months later.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi stood side-by-side on a rock, watching two streaks of light flash across the sky.</p><p>"Lately, mysterious figures have been roaming the Fire Domain, making it unsafe to go out. Fortunately, we harvested enough medicinal herbs beforehand," Gui Hou said.</p><p>Ling Shi pointed at one of the streaks of light, "The escape technique used resembles the renowned Xiaoyun Transcendent Sky Technique from Yun Du Tian!"</p><p>"Yun Du Tian?  It's related to the incident from a few months ago, isn't it?  Did Liuhe Sect's Fu Xiao escape back to their sect and report it to Yun Du Tian?" Gui Hou speculated.</p><p>"Is Yun Du Tian simply targeting the Luohun Abyss, or are they also interested in the treasure the old demon seeks? What kind of treasure is worth this much?"</p><p>Ling Shi was equally curious, turning towards the cave on the mountaintop, "The senior hasn't given any orders yet.  What are their plans? Secretly seize the treasure, or watch from the sidelines?"</p><p>"The master prioritizes cultivation and comprehending the Dao.  A few remnants of uncertain value are not worth rash action.  Don't speculate unnecessarily; we only need to obey orders," Gui Hou shook his head and flew back to the cave.</p><p>The entire Daoist temple, as per Qin Sang's instructions, had its spirit array activated and was concealed.</p><p>…</p><p>Luohun Abyss.</p><p>Named after the abyss, the entire sect is located in a sunless chasm.</p><p>The abyss is west of the Mulu Mountain, a fissure in the earth, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom.</p><p>Deeper into the abyss, tomb-like caves and coffins hanging from the cliffs gradually appear.</p><p>Even insects and beasts dare not enter. There are no other sounds, only gusts of cold wind, creating an increasingly eerie atmosphere.</p><p>Shadows flash occasionally, like ghosts.</p><p>At the very bottom of the abyss is a river, its water black and murky, leaving muddy traces on both banks, yet emitting a fragrant aroma.</p><p>The Black River flowed silently.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure in black robes descended and stood by the bank, respectfully saying, "Master, your disciple seeks an audience!"</p><p>The river remained silent.</p><p>The black-robed person waited patiently, finally hearing a voice, "Speak."</p><p>The voice was icy, devoid of emotion.</p><p>The black-robed person, without hesitation, said, "Feiluo and the others revealed their whereabouts.  Yun Du Tian has sent experts into the Fire Domain, and they must have noticed we're searching for the Panlong Ancient Array. Feiluo feels he has failed his mission and is kneeling outside awaiting your judgment."</p><p>This time, the river didn't remain silent for long, but the voice was still emotionless.</p><p>"Sooner than expected.  But once it begins, it will undoubtedly be noticed by Yun Du Tian.  Anything else?"</p>
