<h1>Chapter 907: The Power of Heaven and Earth</h1><p>Deserted Island.</p><p>The setting sun painted the sky with hues of red, as crimson tides crashed against the shore.</p><p>A streak of light, like a shooting star, flew towards the island, paused briefly above it, then swerved downwards, vanishing into the dense forest at the island's center. A figure carrying a black coffin emerged.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>After receiving the message from his avatar, he flew non-stop for a day and a night in a fixed direction.  Once he was certain of his safety, he descended upon this island for a short rest and to examine his spoils.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, then used his Ebony Sword to dig a cave at the base of an old tree. He set up several concealment and sealing formations before entering.</p><p>Silence returned to the deserted island.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang adjusted his breathing slightly, then retrieved two storage pouches and placed them before him.</p><p>The pouches were sealed with hastily applied restrictions, which Qin Sang swiftly dispelled before emptying their contents.</p><p>Initially, he didn't notice the stone platform, and after searching, he couldn't find the treasure he had expected.</p><p>He did find a dozen or so Beast King Banners. Qin Sang placed them together with the one he had previously acquired, intending to study them carefully later; perhaps he could replicate the set.</p><p>He also collected numerous spirit stones, pills, and crafting materials.</p><p>Both the black-robed cultivator and the dwarf were Foundation Establishment cultivators from a major Wu Clan sect, holding high positions and possessing considerable wealth.</p><p>With these, combined with the astonishing haul he'd obtained from killing the Fourth Elder of Black Serpent Mountain, he wouldn't have to worry about cultivation resources for at least the next few decades before the Seven Killing Palace opened.</p><p>However, after careful consideration, Qin Sang realized that his cultivation would soon stagnate.  Focusing solely on body refinement and nurturing his avatar wouldn't consume that many resources.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang beckoned a jade slip into his palm and eagerly examined its contents.</p><p>The jade slip contained two parts.</p><p>One was a cultivation method called the "Yuanchen Scripture".</p><p>The other was a Dao technique, the "Lightning Mastery Technique."</p><p>"Lightning Mastery Techniqueâ€¦"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and a hint of joy appeared on his face. "This technique must be the terrifying lightning method used by the cultivator from Bullfighting Peak."</p><p>The "Lightning Mastery Technique" had left a deep impression on him. The situation back then had been perilous. Despite the five Foundation Establishment cultivators controlling the "Cold Sky Fierce Wind Formation" from a considerable distance, the lightning had forcibly broken through their formation, and its residual power had been devastating, destroying his Golden Radiance Armor.  Even now, the memory still sent chills down his spine.</p><p>If not for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's lightning resistance, his escape would have been far more difficult.</p><p>The presence of baleful star power within the lightning had also piqued Qin Sang's curiosity.</p><p>However, the "Lightning Mastery Technique" wasn't Qin Sang's immediate priority.  He skimmed through it before carefully examining the "Yuanchen Scripture," a look of disappointment spreading across his face.</p><p>It wasn't what he had expected.</p><p>The true inheritance of Bullfighting Peak wasn't a cultivation method but this immensely powerful Dao technique. The "Yuanchen Scripture" seemed to be a supplementary cultivation method specifically designed for practicing the "Lightning Mastery Technique," perhaps created or found due to a lack of a suitable original pairing.</p><p>The "Yuanchen Scripture" and the "Lightning Mastery Technique" weren't inherently linked.</p><p>The "Lightning Mastery Technique" was a standalone inheritance. Perhaps it originally had a corresponding cultivation method, but for some reason, it was lost, making independent cultivation impossible. This likely led to the adoption of the "Yuanchen Scripture."</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered similar situations before and wasn't surprised.</p><p>The "Yuanchen Scripture" was a rather mediocre cultivation method.</p><p>Its only merit was its ability to resist and dispel baleful star power within the body.</p><p>The essence of the Dao technique was to harness baleful star power to control the might of lightning, hence the name "Lightning Mastery Technique." This was why Qin Sang sensed the peculiar coexistence of baleful star power and lightning when he was struck.</p><p>People marvel at the beauty of the constellations but fear the chaotic and sinister baleful star power.</p><p>Yet, they fail to realize that the countless powers of heaven and earth are all mysterious and potent, inherently neither good nor evil. To the world, cultivators are merely slightly larger ants than mortals, and fear stems from the unknown.</p><p>While others dread baleful star power, brilliant predecessors from both human and demon races have attempted to control this power, forging two distinct paths.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Body Refining Art" uses the power of the constellations for body refinement, drawing upon baleful star power to temper the bloodline, ascending step by step towards the Heavenly Demon realm.</p><p>The "Lightning Mastery Technique" harnesses baleful star power to command another force of heaven and earth, creating a supreme Dao technique.</p><p>Unfortunately, humans lack the natural advantages of demons, and the technique harbors hidden dangers.  Practicing the "Lightning Mastery Technique" makes one vulnerable to baleful star power infiltrating the Nascent Soul, a difficult affliction to eradicate, often leading to madness or worse. The only recourse is to find a way to dispel it.</p><p>The Falling Star Sect likely sought the "Yuanchen Scripture" to address this hidden danger, but they probably failed, as evidenced by the abandonment of the Bullfighting Peak lineage.</p><p>Neither the "Yuanchen Scripture" nor the "Lightning Mastery Technique" mentioned Stellar Infusion, suggesting that path was a dead end.</p><p>Nevertheless, his meticulous planning and nearly year-long scheme had yielded considerable rewards.</p><p>He had thwarted his enemies' plans, exacting a measure of revenge, and obtained a useful cultivation method and a Dao technique.</p><p>The cultivation method he referred to was naturally the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art."</p><p>Protected by the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of baleful star power, making the "Yuanchen Scripture" largely irrelevant to him.</p><p>Among the cultivation methods Qin Sang had encountered over the years, excluding unique inheritances like the "Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter" and the "Heavenly Demon Body Refining Art,"</p><p>the one that impressed him most was the Falling Star Sect's Yin-Yang lineage's "Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art."</p><p>During his Foundation Establishment, he had inadvertently condensed Yin and Yang energies, granting him a deeper understanding of the Dao of Yin and Yang than others.</p><p>The "Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art" surprisingly involved the cultivation of Yin and Yang Armor and Yin and Yang energies from the very beginning of cultivation.  His avatar's acquisition of the first level of the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art" had proven to be quite profound, suggesting it was a major orthodox inheritance from ancient times.</p><p>It stood to reason that cultivating this method would be beneficial for forming a Gold Core.</p><p>However, the decline of the Yin-Yang lineage made Qin Sang suspect that the predecessor who created the subsequent levels might not have fully grasped the original method's true essence, hence his diminished interest.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Yin-Yang Armor could conceal the Buddha's light, resolving a minor concern.</p><p>What truly delighted Qin Sang was the "Lightning Mastery Technique."</p><p>This technique possessed immense power.  While others feared cultivating it due to the risk of baleful star power, Qin Sang had no such worries. Moreover, his simultaneous cultivation of the "Heavenly Demon Body Refining Art" would prove advantageous in mastering this Dao technique.</p><p>If he could master the "Lightning Mastery Technique," it would undoubtedly be a devastating weapon, surpassing even the Star Conch in power, and would pose a threat even to Nascent Soul ancestors once he reached late-stage Foundation Establishment.</p><p>As long as his "Heavenly Demon Body Refining Art" progressed smoothly, achieving late-stage Foundation Establishment power through dual cultivation of body and Qi wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang was self-aware and wouldn't provoke Nascent Soul ancestors lightly. However, life was unpredictable, and the Seven Killing Palace was fraught with peril.  No one could predict the future.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed the "Lightning Mastery Technique" several times, imprinting it deeply in his mind.  After careful contemplation, he concluded that there were no issues and that he could indeed cultivate it.</p>
