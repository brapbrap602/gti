<h1>Chapter 1195: The Heavenly Scar</h1><p>The Abyss of Sin, anciently known as the Heavenly Scar, is the largest chasm in the Northern Star Realm. This scar runs almost perfectly north-south, bisecting the entire region and dividing it into east and west halves.  After cultivators discovered the Sin God Palace deep within the Abyss, some began calling the entire area the Abyss of Sin, a name that eventually became the common term for the surrounding territories.</p><p>On the topographical map drawn by Senior Sister Qing Jun, most of the prominent sects in the Abyss of Sin are built along the Heavenly Scar. Some sects are even situated very close together, sharing a major spirit vein, in their efforts to be as near as possible to the Scar.</p><p>Spirit veins can move, but doing so requires significant effort and formations, especially for superlative veins that serve as a sect's foundation – they cannot be moved too far. The reason is the abundance of cultivation resources within the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>It is said that the Heavenly Scar is several hundred miles wide at its narrowest point, and its widest point is immeasurable. It's an insurmountable barrier to mortals, teeming with spiritual herbs, treasures, and opportunities.  The most fortunate might even discover ancient cultivator relics, achieving instant ascension.</p><p>However, opportunity always comes with danger.  Deeper into the Heavenly Scar, the terrain becomes increasingly constricted, and the area is riddled with ancient prohibitions, incredibly dangerous and having claimed countless cultivator lives. It’s somewhat like the Boundless Valley, only far larger, though it cannot compare to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>At the deepest, most dangerous heart of the Heavenly Scar lies the Sin God Palace.  Since its discovery, the Sin God Palace has always appeared at the same time as the Purple Micro Palace, strongly suggesting a connection between the two realms.</p><p>During periods of calmer relations, cultivators from both regions had repeatedly collaborated to explore both realms, attempting to unlock the mysteries of the Purple Micro Palace, but always to no avail.</p><p>It wasn't until Ye Laomo led his forces to attack the Purple Micro Palace's Immortal Array, ambushing cultivators from both realms, that the connection between the Sin God Palace and the Purple Micro Palace was confirmed.</p><p>“…The Abyss of Sin is heavily guarded, with most of the experts stationed on the Heavenly Path Plateau, leaving the interior vulnerable.  Going to the Abyss of Sin now will be safer than usual,” explained the Serpent King.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, “The Serpent King is also going to the Abyss of Sin. What a coincidence.” The Serpent King's description of the Great Demon's lair as being deep within the Heavenly Scar was still quite vague.  Since Qin Sang intended to go to the Abyss of Sin anyway, traveling with them would offer mutual protection, regardless of the treasures found. However, Qin Sang didn't immediately agree, deciding to ask for more information first.</p><p>“Besides the two of you, who else is going?”  Qin Sang assumed, unless something unexpected happened, they would all be demon kings; only they would have the leisure to seek treasures in the Abyss of Sin under these circumstances.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Serpent King shook his head. “To be frank, Qienji's strength is insufficient; he cannot go.  My other companions are not demon kings from the Sky Demon Mound, but rather friends I made while traveling through the desert.”</p><p>“There are transformed cultivators in the desert?” Qin Sang asked in surprise.</p><p>Then, he thought again. The vastness of the Northern Star Desert means that even if it is barren, the emergence of several Yuan Ying or transformed great demons is quite normal.</p><p>The Serpent King nodded. “That's right! That lair was actually discovered by another friend. After the gambling duel, I immediately contacted them, hoping to invite Daoist Mingyue to join us. However, they were concerned that Daoist Mingyue, having only recently transformed, had not yet fully mastered their abilities and might become a burden, so I was unable to persuade them. It was only after news of Daoist Mingyue’s recent defeat of Elder Pei spread through the cultivation world, confirming your exceptional strength, that they finally agreed. If you feel it's difficult to explain your absence to the human cultivators, you can have Qienji temporarily take your place in Sandie Pass; we are, after all, one family…”</p><p>The Serpent King spoke at length, addressing all of Qin Sang's concerns.</p><p>After hearing this, Qin Sang hesitated and asked, "May I inquire, how confident are you about this treasure hunt? And what is the precise location of the lair?"</p><p>Something felt wrong.</p><p>Qienji's strength wasn't weak for a cultivator at the early stage of transformation; only because he was countered by Qin Sang was he defeated so quickly.  Yet he was deemed unqualified to join the expedition.  Even with the assistance of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to break through prohibitions, they remained so cautious, indicating a substantial level of danger.</p><p>Qin Sang was starting to reconsider his participation.</p><p>The Serpent King hesitated. "I hope you understand, Daoist Mingyue. Once you agree, I can provide all the information. Or you could make a heart demon oath…"</p><p>Qin Sang had a good impression of the Serpent King and didn't want to trick him with a heart demon oath. He waved his hand. "I'll name several locations; just tell me if the great demon's lair is near any of them…"</p><p>Qin Sang then listed several place names.</p><p>The Serpent King readily agreed, "I didn't expect Daoist Mingyue to be so knowledgeable about the Abyss of Sin!  Indeed, the cave is near one of their strongholds.  You must understand why we're so cautious."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>The locations he'd mentioned were the mountain gates of prominent factions within the Abyss of Sin, and important sites similar to the Sinful God's Palace.  Some of these places even his senior sister Qing Jun avoided.</p><p>"I'm afraid I'm not up to the task…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He mentally weighed the risks against the potential rewards of raiding a powerful demon's lair.</p><p>Seeing this, the Serpent King hastened to add, "The ancient barrier weakens in a few months. We've gathered several methods to break it. With Daoist Mingyue and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's help, we'll be able to slip into the demon king's cave without alarming the Abyss of Sin. Their hesitation stems from not wanting to share the treasure. After we succeed, Daoist Lu, who discovered the cave, gets first pick of one item. The rest will be evenly divided. But, in my opinion, those are secondary concerns.  The most important thing is the demon's collection of cultivation techniques and secrets—these are to be shared by everyone, not hoarded by a single individual!"</p><p>The Serpent King's words were laced with temptation.</p><p>An untouched ancient demon king's cave was a huge draw for any demon king.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was dealing with Qin Sang.</p><p>"Thank you for your kindness, but I'm afraid I can't join you."</p><p>Qin Sang rose, bowed, and politely declined.</p><p>"Won't you reconsider?"</p><p>The Serpent King was incredulous.</p><p>He hadn't anticipated Mingyue's refusal.</p><p>Finding a cultivation technique in an ancient demon king's cave would be a significant gain.</p><p>Discovering an ancient tribulation-crossing technique would be incredibly fortunate.</p><p>Mingyue was adept at lightning escape techniques and possessed other supernatural abilities and treasures, giving him ample means of self-preservation. If a little danger deterred him, he wasn't worthy of the title "Demon King"!</p><p>"I appreciate the offer…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't elaborate.</p><p>He couldn't exactly say he was a fake demon king, and demon cultivation techniques weren't particularly tempting to him.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* only covered physical body cultivation.  While he'd unexpectedly acquired Azure-luán blood essence, it could only be integrated into his wings.</p><p>If the risk wasn't so high, he might consider it.</p><p>Stirring up trouble in enemy territory, only to obtain techniques he likely couldn't cultivate, was a pointless endeavor for Qin Sang.</p>
