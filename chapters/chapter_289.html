<h1>Chapter 282: Setting Off</h1><p>Ge Yuan chuckled and said, "Senior, you overestimate me. Even if we can't find the medicinal garden, I know a few places in Autumn Fair Market where treasures are stored. If we work together, we're bound to find something, and you won't return empty-handed."</p><p>Yun Youzi smiled and nodded, only perfunctorily echoing Ge Yuan.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that Yun Youzi, like himself, was primarily interested in healing herbs. If they couldn't find them, their efforts would truly be in vain.</p><p>The three of them each dripped a drop of their blood essence onto the Harmony Pendants, merging them together.</p><p>After absorbing the blood essence, the pendants became linked to each other.</p><p>Each of them took one pendant, and after further discussion, they parted ways, each going their own way.</p><p>They agreed not to contact each other unless absolutely necessary before entering Autumn Fair Market.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>In the small courtyard.</p><p>Everyone stood together as Yu Kong explained the Convergence Formation to them in detail.</p><p>The principle of the Convergence Formation wasn't complex. It could gather a portion of the power of the nine people within the formation and focus it onto one person, combining the strength of all nine to deal with any critical situations that might arise when breaking the formation.</p><p>The formation didn't strictly require nine people, but if the number was insufficient, its power would be greatly reduced. If there were only three or two people, it would be almost useless. In such cases, it would be better to act independently and adapt to the circumstances.</p><p>The Convergence Formation reached its maximum effectiveness with nine participants.</p><p>Among the nine, the person receiving the power was also the leader of the formation, known as the Formation Eye. The Formation Eye could be rotated, but it took time, which might not be available in a crisis.  Only if the current leader was injured and couldn't perform their duties would they consider switching to someone else.</p><p>Among the group, Yu Kong had the highest cultivation level and had previously entered Autumn Fair Market, making him the undisputed leader.</p><p>After carefully studying the Convergence Formation, Qin Sang felt it differed significantly from the Nine Radiance Star River Formation. The biggest difference lay in the autonomy of the participants.</p><p>Once the Nine Radiance Star River Formation was activated, everyone's power formed a river of stars, immensely powerful, but the participants lost all freedom.  The formation continuously drew their spiritual energy, and they couldn't even leave the formation.</p><p>Unless they deeply trusted each other,</p><p>or, like when they explored the ancient cultivator's ruins, there was a powerful figure overseeing them,</p><p>they wouldn't agree to use this formation.</p><p>The formation, as improved by Sikong Muyue, mitigated this flaw somewhat, but it still existed.</p><p>However, every advantage has its disadvantage. Precisely because of its rigidity, mastering the Nine Radiance Star River Formation didn't take long.</p><p>The Convergence Formation was different. Though the leader still held considerable power, their control over the others wasn't as absolute. In a dire situation, each person could flee without being dragged down by the leader.</p><p>---</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that Yu Kong chose the Convergence Formation out of necessity. After all, they were strangers and couldn't establish much trust, but this also increased instability.</p><p>Yu Kong specifically issued a warning about this.</p><p>"Unless your life is truly in danger, no one is allowed to leave the Convergence Formation without permission. Otherwise, if you endanger others, don't blame me for being ruthless! I've made this clear in advance, so don't say I didn't warn you!"</p><p>Yu Kong's smile vanished as he swept his gaze coldly over everyone, reminding them that he was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, not a benevolent scholar.</p><p>Under Yu Kong's gaze, Qin Sang nodded solemnly. He glanced at the others, noting their varied expressions, finally landing on the three people who had joined later.</p><p>These three were also rogue cultivators recruited by Yu Kong.</p><p>One was a withered old man in a black robe.  His hands were incredibly thin, like a pair of eagle's claws. He was known as Old Man Mu Teng.</p><p>His wood-elemental spells were incredibly powerful.</p><p>The second was a short, stout middle-aged man named Wu Chen. Like Qin Sang, he was skilled in swordsmanship, but his sword was hidden in a fan he carried. The seven fan ribs were seven sharp blades.</p><p>The last was a woman dressed in revealing red gauze. She had a seductive aura, eyes like flowing waves, as if she were flirting with everyone. Her name was equally alluring: Crescent Moon Fairy.</p><p>Xiu Zhirui also possessed a certain charm, but compared to Crescent Moon Fairy, she seemed rather naive. As women, they seemed to dislike each other, with unspoken tension between them.</p><p>Crescent Moon Fairy's magical tool was a ball of red thread, capable of various transformations.</p><p>Like Wu Chen's fan, it seemed more like a concealed weapon.</p><p>Including Qin Sang, each person demonstrated impressive strength, making them stand out even among rogue cultivators.</p><p>"These jade slips contain the various transformations of the Convergence Formation. After you memorize them, we'll begin practicing the formation. We'll set off in three months," Yu Kong said, distributing the jade slips.</p><p>Crescent Moon Fairy reacted to Yu Kong's decision with exaggerated surprise, covering her mouth with her hand. </p><p>"Senior Yu, why such haste? Isn't the Autumn Wilds Market still at least a year away from opening?"</p><p>Crescent Moon Fairy's voice, like her appearance, was utterly enchanting, igniting a warmth in the listener's core. Those with weaker wills could be easily captivated by her voice alone.</p><p>Yu Kong, however, remained unfazed by Crescent Moon Fairy's charm, patiently explaining, "The protective formation around the Autumn Wilds Market is unpredictable. I've just received news that it has shifted again.</p><p>The weakened state of the formation is fleeting, leaving us with little time.</p><p>It's best we arrive early and wait outside the market.  The moment the formation weakens, we'll enter immediately. Even a few extra minutes inside could mean acquiring another treasure.</p><p>Moreover, the journey from West Wasteland Town to the Autumn Wilds Market is considerable.  An early departure allows for a less hurried journey, giving us time to train, familiarize ourselves with each other, and improve our chances of breaking through the formation."</p><p>Following this, they adhered to Yu Kong's instructions.</p><p>Three months passed swiftly. The group cultivated and practiced their formation, becoming incredibly proficient with the Return to Origin Formation. As soon as the time arrived, they departed West Wasteland Town together, heading north.</p><p>Well-stocked with cloud artifacts, spirit pills, and other necessities, they gradually approached the Autumn Wilds Market. As they became more acquainted, they occasionally joined forces to hunt cloud beasts, dividing the spoils evenly. On the surface, the atmosphere within the group was harmonious.</p><p>As time went on, they drew ever closer to the Autumn Wilds Market.</p><p>Along the way, everyone except Yan Wu subtly inquired about Qin Sang's plans once inside the market. After a period of 'consideration,' Qin Sang accepted Yu Kong's invitation.</p><p>He also realized that Yu Kong had extended the invitation to others, likely everyone in the group.</p><p>However, unlike Qin Sang who had ulterior motives, most of the others seemed hesitant.</p><p>Despite his observations, Qin Sang couldn't discern anything unusual about Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong seemed unconcerned by the rumors. Whenever they were mentioned, he would dismissively remind everyone that such an opportunity only arose every thirty years. It would be a shame to waste it on rumors. Instead, they should focus on strategizing how to obtain the most treasures.</p><p>Through Yu Kong's accounts, they gained a general understanding of the Autumn Wilds Market.</p>
