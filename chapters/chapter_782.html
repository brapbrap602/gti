<h1>Chapter 774: Failure</h1><p>Chapter 774: Failure</p><p>The figure approached the demonic fire, activating a secret technique to carefully examine it.  Although the other party was cautious, erasing their tracks upon leaving, it couldn't escape his keen eyes; he found traces.</p><p>“I tried every method to probe it before, nearly perishing in the demonic flames. Even a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator would only be able to watch helplessly.  Who was it?  The two late-stage Nascent Soul experts who entered the Seven Killing Hall, the Demon Lord and the Great Shaman, entered the Sky Tower and haven’t been seen since.  The other old demons, their cultivations are at most comparable to mine. Unless they possess ancient treasures or cultivated some special demonic technique.  The origin of this demonic fire is extraordinary; it wasn't naturally formed but is a supernatural power of an ancient demon. If they cultivated a similar ancient demonic technique, it's indeed possible. I know the backgrounds of these old geezers inside and out. Is there something I’ve overlooked…?”</p><p>The blackness in his eyes receded, returning to normal. He paced back and forth, guessing the other person's identity.</p><p>“Did the demonic fire undergo some change, its power weakened?”</p><p>He was uncertain, suddenly darting towards the demonic fire.</p><p>Entering the range of the demonic fire's power, a layer of blue flame suddenly appeared on the figure.  The flame was thin but extremely tough, like a protective shield.</p><p>Under the protection of the blue flame, the figure stepped forward, inching closer to the demonic fire's core.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the range of the demonic fire's power, his eyes suddenly dimmed, his gaze vacant, and then a confused expression appeared on his face, as if he were losing his mind.</p><p>At that moment, the figure forcefully bit his tongue. The sharp pain jolted him awake, and he immediately retreated, fleeing in a panic.</p><p>He moved far away from the demonic fire, gasping for breath, still terrified.</p><p>The demonic fire's power hadn't changed from before; its primordial power hadn't erupted yet, and he nearly succumbed. The strangeness and terror of the ancient demonic cultivator's methods are unimaginable to later generations.</p><p>Even someone as strong as himself couldn’t withstand it. How did that mysterious person manage it?</p><p>He shook his head, staring at the demonic fire's core. “Never mind, let's try taming the demonic fire! Even if someone else got to the treasure first, as long as I can claim this demonic fire, dominating the Canglang Sea will be imminent. Perhaps there’s even a chance to break through to the Divine Transformation stage. What treasure can't I obtain then?”</p><p>The figure made up his mind.  Maintaining a distance from the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, he sat cross-legged.</p><p>A blue light flickered at his brow, and then a tiny blue flame flew out from his forehead, floating in front of him.</p><p>This blue flame was crystal clear, suspended in mid-air, gently swaying, exquisitely beautiful.</p><p>Maintaining the blue flame seemed strenuous; his face was flushed, and sweat dripped from his temples.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>He softly called out, his consciousness surging.</p><p>The blue flame swayed slightly and then drifted lightly towards the demonic fire's core.  It wasn't dispersed by the demonic fire's aura.</p><p>He opened his eyes, watching the blue flame with anticipation. Seeing it successfully traverse the distance and approach the core, he was overjoyed.</p><p>The blue flame hovered before the demonic fire's core, its fluctuation more pronounced than before.</p><p>Seeing this, the figure knew that if it continued, the blue flame wouldn't be able to withstand the demonic fire's pressure, and he immediately began to operate his cultivation technique to attempt to subdue the demonic fire.</p><p>He continuously changed hand seals. A powerful suction force appeared within the blue flame, aimed at the demonic fire, attempting to draw out a wisp of the demonic fire to be consumed by the blue flame.</p><p>The cultivation technique worked. The demonic fire wasn't angered; a small flame seemed to actually detach from the core, about to be drawn in by the blue flame.</p><p>A look of joy just appeared on the figure's face.</p><p>At that moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>As the demonic fire approached, the blue flame shook violently, its flames shrinking back, seemingly fearing and dodging.</p><p>The figure was startled and quickly used all his mental strength to maintain the blue flame.  Unexpectedly, the blue flame exploded without warning.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Like fireworks blooming, the blue flame completely shattered.</p><p>Fragments of flame dissipated into the void, beautiful and ethereal.</p><p>The wisp of demonic fire immediately returned to its original place; the demonic fire's core remained unchanged.</p><p>Simultaneously, a shrill scream rang out.</p><p>The moment the blue flame exploded, the figure screamed, falling to the ground. He clasped his head tightly, his body curled up, trembling uncontrollably, enduring immense pain.</p><p>After a while, he trembled as he sat up, his hair disheveled, his eyes bloodshot, and blood flowing from his seven orifices.</p><p>He was covered in dust, a sorry sight.  Ignoring this, he quickly entered a meditative state to regulate his breathing. After a while, his breath steadied, and he slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>“It’s still not working! Unless I can find more spirit flames to strengthen the seed… this level of spirit flame is incredibly rare. I only found out about it by chance…”</p><p>He sighed deeply. Another failure.  The blue flame was so afraid of the demonic flame; before even making contact, the seed shattered.  Trying to directly use a cultivation technique to condense the demonic flame into a seed was unthinkable. He’d probably burn himself to ashes before completing the technique.</p><p>He tried several more times, each attempt ending in failure. Finally, he gave up, stood up, and his gaze fell on the space beside the main demonic flame, his eyes flickering.</p><p>“What method did that person use to resist the demonic flame and move through it? If I could get my hands on it… there are demonic flames blocking the way outside, and the inner restrictions are likely even more dangerous. He might not be able to take the treasure! And seeing such a high-level demonic flame, wouldn't he be tempted?  He might return here later…”</p><p>His eyes suddenly lit up. He carefully wiped away any trace of his presence and disappeared.</p><p>The canyon fell silent once more. The demonic flame flickered, and poisonous mist drifted.</p><p>…</p><p>At the edge of the forest.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from behind an ancient tree, looking out at the wilderness with alertness. He had changed his clothes and wasn't wearing his cloak. As long as Cui Ji and Xiang Yi were still alive, he couldn't appear as Qingfeng Daozhang. He wasn't afraid of Cui Ji, but Xiang Yi's background was too powerful; he feared that he would use his influence to have him secretly assassinated.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the others had already left, and Qin Sang didn't know where to find them. He decided to focus on his own task first.</p><p>The wilderness stretched endlessly, devoid of any other figures.  Qin Sang moved along the forest edge, heading towards the mountains.</p><p>Soon, he reached the first mountain.  It wasn't particularly tall, but it extended endlessly, blocking the forest and wilderness, like a high wall forming a clear dividing line.</p><p>Beyond this mountain, rolling hills stretched as far as the eye could see, filled with countless hidden realms and dangers lurking everywhere. Some places were even more notorious than the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>His poison-proof armor was useless in such places, leaving him to rely entirely on his own caution.</p><p>The Sky Tower was located behind the mountains.  After crossing a few mountains, the Sky Tower would come into view.  There was no fixed path to the Tower from here, but certain dangerous areas could be avoided.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a simple map, located himself, and discovered that entering the mountains from this point was a relatively good choice. After planning a route, he set off.</p>
