Chapter 696: The Deal


“What price are you asking?”
Qin Sang fiddled with the bone flute for a moment, feigning great interest, then looked up and asked the stall owner.


The stall owner had been silently observing Qin Sang as he examined the flute. Upon hearing the question, he didn't answer immediately. He paused, lost in thought, but finally couldn't resist asking, “Have you recognized the origin of this bone?”


Qin Sang, having already prepared an excuse, shook his head. “No, but I sense something from this bone, something that seems somewhat compatible with my cultivation technique.”
He was using the *Dun Ling Jue* technique to mask his aura. Since the stall owner's cultivation level was similar to his, he wasn't afraid of being exposed.


The stall owner's eyes flickered. “Forgive my boldness, but may I ask what cultivation technique you practice?”


Qin Sang snorted coldly. “That is indeed a bold question! However, even without my saying, you can probably guess. It doesn't matter if I tell you. My cultivation technique is unique; it requires the power of the stars. That is why I am interested in this bone. You should know that whether in the Inner Sea or the Outer Sea, treasures like this bone, imbued with the power of the constellations, are rare. Having encountered one, regardless of its use, I don't want to miss it.”


The stall owner let out a hoarse, strange laugh. “As far as I know, considering both human and witch clans, cultivation techniques that utilize the power of the stars are rarer than such treasures. It seems this object is indeed destined for you.”


Qin Sang's face showed impatience. “Have you decided? Are you selling or not?”


“I'll sell!”
The stall owner gritted his teeth and agreed decisively. However, when it came to discussing the price, hesitation returned to his face. He unexpectedly said, “Just one magic treasure, and you can have it.”


Qin Sang's expression darkened abruptly. He said angrily, “Are you toying with me? Or are you taking advantage of my interest and demanding an exorbitant price? Not only do I not have any spare magic treasures, even if I did, I wouldn't trade them for something of unknown use. I see you have no sincerity.”


The stall owner's face showed embarrassment. He hurriedly called Qin Sang back. By this point, the commotion of their argument had attracted the attention of others nearby. The stall owner waved his hand, casting a soundproof barrier, and whispered, “Fellow Daoist, please don't be angry. Take a closer look at this object. It appears to be bone, but it's actually a strange material, neither bone nor otherwise. This material is unique in the cultivation world; even we Core Formation cultivators can't see through it. This material alone is worth no less than a magic treasure, not to mention the unknown secrets it may hold.”


Then, abandoning his pretense, the stall owner began to play the victim.


“Before you, Fellow Daoist, I won't hide anything. Look at my current state, all thanks to those witch clan scoundrels. I barely escaped with my life after self-destructing my natal magic treasure. All my savings have gone to healing elixirs; I have nothing left to buy another magic treasure. Without a magic treasure, even if my injuries heal, how much of my strength will remain? This setback makes my path to immortality even more hopeless. This bone flute is a relic left by my master, of great significance to me. If I weren't forced into this desperate situation, I would never have considered parting with it.”


Qin Sang's earlier feeling had been correct; this man was indeed seriously injured and hadn't recovered.  It seemed the injuries were quite severe; even after consuming so many elixirs, his complexion hadn't improved.


Hearing the stall owner's seemingly heartfelt words, Qin Sang's expression softened slightly, but he remained unwilling to budge. “I don't care how you acquired it. You’ve held it for years, so you must know it better than I. In my opinion, it’s unlikely to hold any secrets. It's most likely a fragment of some treasure. If one could gather all the fragments, that would be different, but with only this small piece, its value is greatly diminished. The vast Demon Sea makes it impossible to gather the rest. I'm only willing to gamble on a slim chance. I'll offer one talisman treasure at most.”


Qin Sang placed a talisman treasure in front of the stall owner.


The stall owner’s face fell, seeing that Qin Sang had easily seen through the object. He said dejectedly, “As expected of a cultivator of stellar power, your insight is sharp... but this object is no ordinary treasure.  No matter how weakened I am, I wouldn't sell it for a mere talisman treasure. If you're unwilling to offer a higher price, I can only wait for the trade fair or return to Hutian Island and see if the Island Master is interested.”


The stall owner’s expression was resolute; negotiations seemed to have reached an impasse.


Although Qin Sang knew he was bluffing, he didn’t dare gamble that no one else would recognize the flute’s value. He thought for a moment and asked, “Do you know where your master obtained this bone flute?”


The stall owner shook his head.  “When I met my master, he already had it. I later heard him mention that he seemed to have bought it at a trade fair in the Inner Sea.  I have no idea of the specific location.  If we knew its origin, my master and I would have searched for the rest long ago.  We wouldn't have waited until now.”


So it was from the Inner Sea, though it was also possible it had originated in the Demon Sea and ended up there.


Qin Sang had hoped to find some clues through this person. If there were other fragments, he could follow the trail. He had been too optimistic.


However, since he already had one piece, he couldn’t miss this opportunity.


Thinking this, Qin Sang’s expression became troubled. He glanced cautiously around and transmitted his voice, “Forgive my bluntness, but you've probably approached others with this, haven’t you, and failed to reach a deal? How about this, I can offer a bit more, a natal magic treasure in exchange... but let's be clear, after we leave this place, I will absolutely deny that this natal magic treasure came from me.”


“A natal magic treasure?”
The stall owner was taken aback, looking at Qin Sang suspiciously. “Someone else’s natal magic treasure?”


“Could it be my own?”
Qin Sang sneered. “Don’t look at me like that. This magic treasure is spoils of war, seized from a witch clan scoundrel. I don’t want trouble, so I'm making this clear upfront.”


Understanding dawned on the stall owner’s face. “In these times, such situations are not uncommon. I haven't heard of anyone kindly returning such items. Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. It’s just… a natal magic treasure is refined with the owner's life essence. In the hands of another, its power is inevitably diminished. This…”


“With careful nurturing, the magic treasure's power can be gradually restored. It won’t be much different.”
Qin Sang snorted.  “A fragment of unknown origin for a magic treasure. If you're still not satisfied, I can only take my leave.”


“Fine! Take it, Fellow Daoist!”
The stall owner reluctantly handed the bone flute to Qin Sang. The corner of Qin Sang's mouth curled up slightly as he retrieved another person’s natal magic treasure and gave it to the stall owner.


Seeing that it was a spirit sword, most adept at killing, the stall owner's eyes lit up with delight.


Qin Sang didn't linger, turning to leave.


After a few steps, he deliberately placed the bone flute into his storage pouch, but it immediately popped back out.


Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation and quickly left.


Only then did the stall owner, who had been secretly watching Qin Sang's back, look away, lovingly fondling the spirit sword in his hand.
