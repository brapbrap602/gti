<h1>Chapter 1786: The Altar of Jushan Prefecture</h1><p>The two stood in the heart of a mountain range, nestled between two towering peaks.  Night had fallen, the moon yet to rise.</p><p>The normally dark mountain pass was bathed in a radiant glow.  This vibrant light illuminated not only the two individuals, but the entire northern foothills of the mountain range, extending to the northern plains and the vegetation that thrived there.  The land and its creatures seemed draped in a shimmering tapestry.</p><p>This wasn't the sunset's afterglow. The light emanated from the direction they were facing.  Vast, multicolored auspicious clouds drifted across the horizon, their expanse seemingly limitless.</p><p>These clouds were not stationary; they flowed constantly, yet never strayed from their location.  Thick cloud cover obscured the land, the mountains, all living things.  </p><p>Strange light emanated from deep within the clouds, piercing through to create a breathtaking, multicolored spectacle.  It seemed as if an eternal sun resided within, its light illuminating the world endlessly, day and night.</p><p>This area was perpetually bathed in daylight. Even when the moon rose, its outline was barely visible to the cultivators' eyes, overwhelmed by the radiant glow.  The light was almost blinding; despite being more than ten miles away, they were enveloped in it, their figures appearing indistinct.</p><p>However, the light didn't harm the local creatures. The nearby vegetation was even more lush than elsewhere. Certain light-seeking beasts were drawn to the area and gathered there.  </p><p>Yet, a profound silence reigned around the two. The area surrounding the auspicious clouds was eerily quiet.  This was because, shortly before, the clouds had vibrated intensely, the resulting waves triggering an instinctive fear in all living things, forcing them to flee in terror.</p><p>The herd Qin Sang and his companion encountered was comprised of such fleeing creatures.  This wasn't unusual; the clouds were unstable and vibrated periodically. After calming down, the beasts would gradually return.</p><p>Now, the clouds were calm.</p><p>The dark-skinned man gazed into the depths of the auspicious clouds, his eyes gleaming with a strange light, as if activating some sort of spiritual vision. He saw vague, fleeting images within – what seemed like celestial palaces, magnificent buildings, a vast starry sea, and a meandering celestial river, all shifting and changing with the movement of the clouds.</p><p>"Why is such a place in the Evil Origin?" he asked, voicing his confusion.</p><p>Entering the Evil Origin evoked only one sensation: desolation!  Common understanding painted the Evil Origin as an undeveloped wilderness; yet this scene was breathtaking, clearly not a natural formation.</p><p>"Look there," the Imperial Censor of Nine Heavens pointed to a palace image that had just flashed into view, "Doesn't it seem familiar?"</p><p>"Familiar?"</p><p>The dark-skinned man frowned, images flooding his mind. He had accompanied the Imperial Censor on visits to several Daoist sects, some of whose temples resembled celestial scenes, yet none matched this in scale.</p><p>Could it be...?</p><p>The dark-skinned man gasped, "The Altar?"</p><p>The Imperial Censor nodded slightly, "Correct! According to ancient texts, this was once the altar of Jushan Prefecture."</p><p>The altar is the core of a prefecture; the altars of Zhongmao and Baishi prefectures are also central to the two Daoist academies.</p><p>"The altar is here? How large was Jushan Prefecture before?" The dark-skinned man was astonished.</p><p>Currently, Jushan Prefecture is the largest of the four prefectures.</p><p>The dark-skinned man had heard the Imperial Censor mention that the altar not only conferred authority but also housed a Daoist artifact called the Du Gong Seal.</p><p>The two Daoist academies each hold the Du Gong Seals of Zhongmao and Baishi prefectures.</p><p>As for the altar's other powers and the Du Gong Seal's capabilities, the dark-skinned man didn't have the answers, nor did the Imperial Censor seem to know everything.</p><p>It is certain that the altar is the foundation of a prefecture, located at its center.  The ability for cultivators to cultivate peacefully after receiving their authority is undeniably connected to the altar; Grand Masters cannot conceal their aura within the Evil Origin, supposedly because they're too far from an altar.</p><p>But this place is so far from the northern border of Jushan Prefecture.  Considering this, how vast was Jushan Prefecture in the past?</p><p>It was larger than the other three prefectures combined.</p><p>The Imperial Censor flicked a golden light, which transformed into a golden mirror before him, displaying the edge of the auspicious clouds. "Daoist records state that Jushan Prefecture was once the foremost of the four, until its altar was destroyed in a cataclysmic battle, leading to its decline."</p><p>"Look..."</p><p>The Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor shifted the image in the mirror, focusing it on the auspicious cloud. The mirror reflected the scene deep within the cloud.  He tapped a few times with his finger. "The shadows of these mountains and rivers might be illusions, or they might truly exist. But they are certainly not the mountains and rivers known to mortals; they are manifestations of divine powers and Taoist techniques. I have ventured deep into the Jushan Altar many times. I once witnessed two star rivers formed by divine powers converging, locked in a stalemate. We paid our respects and quietly retreated. If we had disturbed them, my friend, you probably wouldn't be seeing me now."</p><p>The Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p><p>The legacy of the ancient war, its divine powers still lingering.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor, a late-stage Dong Xuan realm cultivator, just a step away from becoming a Grand Master, yet admitted he couldn't even guarantee his own survival.</p><p>"A battle between True Masters? Or perhaps... a Celestial Master?" The dark-skinned man was utterly shocked.</p><p>Daoist Court Grand Masters remained hidden within the altar, True Masters and Celestial Masters seeming like mere legends.</p><p>The sight of the Jushan Altar indicated that at least in ancient times, this world's Daoist sect had True Masters and Celestial Masters.</p><p>Shaking his head, the Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor said, "It's enough that you know how dangerous it is inside, my friend. There are divine powers of ancient powerhouses, folded and shattered spaces. For countless years, every tremor of the auspicious cloud has been these powers adjusting themselves, maintaining a precarious balance.  Grand Masters, unable to control their own aura, can trigger powerful disturbances, and dare not enter the Jushan Altar. We must be even more cautious. The outer edges of the auspicious cloud are relatively safe, but venturing deep into the Jushan Altar is often a one-way trip!"</p><p>The dark-skinned man, with his current cultivation, naturally understood the importance of caution.</p><p>His expression turned grave. He asked, "Are we going deep into the Jushan Altar this time?"</p><p>The Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor hummed, "Based on your description, the scene you saw before losing consciousness resembles the depths of the Jushan Altar. I suspect you fell into the Jushan Altar after breaking through dimensions and were somehow flung out.  After all, there are countless eternal rifts inside, possibly connecting to other realms. Also, I discovered that before I found you, there was a disturbance in the depths of the auspicious cloud, far more violent and prolonged than any previous record."</p><p>Knowing the origin of the auspicious cloud, and hearing the Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor's account, the dark-skinned man felt a wave of fear.</p><p>He had been subjected to a terrible shock when he broke through to this world, falling unconscious instantly.  Upon waking, he found himself rescued by this Imperial Censor.</p><p>The Jushan Altar was fraught with peril; while unconscious, even a slight disturbance could have easily crushed him.</p><p>Being flung out of the altar, despite his injuries, was an incredible stroke of luck.</p><p>Thinking of this, the dark-skinned man sighed almost imperceptibly. "I remember fragments, surreal images. If I find that place, I might recall more."</p><p>Finding the place in his memory offered hope of finding the gate between the two worlds.</p><p>Not only did he want to leave, but the Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor was also very interested in that place.</p><p>"Unfortunately, despite sending out numerous letters, I haven't found any trace of your companion. Since she was in better condition than you, perhaps she didn't lose consciousness and escaped the Jushan Altar on her own… We needn't rush.  Our primary objective is to investigate the Ghost Fang Kingdom's plot.  We'll have a look around when we have the time, prepare thoroughly, then explore fully later.  Of course, it would be ideal to accomplish two goals at once..."</p><p>Just then, the Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor paused, a soft "Hmm?" escaping his lips. "Someone's arrived."</p><p>The image in the mirror moved rapidly, revealing another valley.</p><p>The valley was overgrown with weeds, as tall as small trees, incredibly dense, yet there were no figures visible.</p><p>Seeing this, the Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor exclaimed, "Excellent concealment! It's fortunate too, with the auspicious cloud's vast expanse, they happen to be nearby. A little farther, and my Celestial Scene Talisman wouldn't have reached them."</p><p>He pointed at the center of the golden mirror; ripples spread across its surface, revealing four blurry figures.</p><p>The four individuals were hidden in the tall weeds, admiring the auspicious cloud. They seemed to be in discussion.</p><p>"Four people, they should be able to cause some trouble for the Ghost Fang Kingdom…"</p><p>The Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>The Jushan Altar contained treasures left over from the ancient war, and some incredibly lucky individuals had received grand legacies from dying powerhouses.</p><p>However, after countless years of exploration by the Daoist Court and demons, very few treasures remained. Even if any slipped through the net, they would be in extremely dangerous places, impossible for ordinary people to obtain.</p><p>Again and again, their efforts proved fruitless.</p><p>Nowadays, fewer and fewer cultivators dared to enter the Jushan Altar.</p><p>The arrival of four Dong Xuan realm cultivators must be in response to the Daoist sect's summons, sent to scout the way.</p><p>Peeking from afar with a divine talisman, the Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor worried about being discovered, so he didn't push the talisman's power to its limit. He also recognized Youhuang Zhenren among the four.</p><p>The other three were with Youhuang Zhenren, so their strengths were probably similar.</p><p>A celestial official, wielding immense power, wiped away the image from a magical mirror and proceeded to cast several talismans, setting up a protective array in preparation for his upcoming plans.  He failed to notice the unusual reaction of the dark-skinned man standing beside him.</p><p>The moment the four figures in the mirror came into view, the dark-skinned man’s gaze froze, fixated on one of them. This individual, standing at the forefront of the group, remained silent during their discussions, his hand repeatedly clenching and unclenching, seemingly lost in thought.  Then, as if sensing something, he looked up.  At that very instant, the celestial official dispelled the magical image. The mirror's reflection vanished, but the blurry face remained imprinted in the dark-skinned man's mind, a flicker of surprise crossing his eyes.</p><p>“How could it be him? Coincidence? Or…”</p><p>“Was he involved in that ascension tribulation?”</p><p>A storm raged within the dark-skinned man, yet his expression remained unchanged.  He glanced at the celestial official, still engrossed in his work, then fell silent, standing respectfully at his side.</p><p>…</p><p>In another valley, Qin Sang and three others battled through waves of monstrous creatures, finally reaching the foot of their target mountain range and finding refuge in a secluded valley.</p><p>"This is the place," said Youhuang Zhenren, gazing at the auspicious clouds with a wistful look. "Shortly after breaking through to the Dongxuan realm, I explored this area with fellow cultivators. We witnessed breathtaking sights."</p><p>"You never mentioned this before," remarked Guyun Zhenren. "You actually entered the heart of the cloud? I only explored the outer regions and returned empty-handed. Did you find any ancient cultivator relics?"</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren chuckled and shook his head. "What ancient relics? The Daoist Court and Guifang Kingdom have countless experts.  It wouldn’t be our turn to find any treasures. I simply went to broaden my horizons and inspire my pursuit of the Dao."</p><p>"That makes sense," Guyun Zhenren turned to Zhijiejian Zhenren. "Might those demon lords have ventured deep into the cloud?  An encounter within would be extremely dangerous.”</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren had been observing the clouds on the horizon. Their appearance was constantly shifting.</p><p>After observing for a while, he said, “The clouds are still unstable. Now isn’t the ideal time to enter. Once they stabilize, cloud paths will appear on three sides, excluding the north. The location of these paths changes each time, but they all lead to the same place – a boundary between the inner and outer regions, quite extensive. The demon lords were previously active in that area. We'll search nearby first, attacking any lone demons we find. If we find nothing, we'll reassess the situation and adjust our plan.”</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren nodded in agreement. "The heart of the auspicious clouds isn't uniformly dangerous.  The risk increases gradually as you go deeper. If we feel threatened, we’ll retreat. We can attack them when they’re least expecting it.”</p><p>The group engaged in a discussion. Qin Sang spoke little, focusing on two tasks at once: listening to their conversation while continuing to comprehend the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" scriptures.  Throughout previous battles, he had repeatedly practiced two of the seal techniques, gradually grasping their intricacies.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang looked up, feeling the radiant light intensify, and sensing turbulent energy deep within the clouds.</p><p>"The clouds are about to shake again. Let's seize this opportunity to enter and look for a cloud path," Zhijiejian Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>Everyone nodded.  They were only ten or so miles from the auspicious clouds – a negligible distance for cultivators, but they couldn't rule out the possibility of demon patrols. The cloud's upheaval should mask their approach.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sea of clouds surged outwards, but didn't spread far, as if encountering an invisible barrier, before retracting.  As the clouds shifted, the radiant light became blinding; a single glance would cause permanent blindness.</p><p>The four found themselves as if standing before the sun, bathed in its intense light.</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren and Youhuang Zhenren each deployed concealment artifacts, shielding the group, while Qin Sang and Guyun Zhenren suppressed their auras. The four dashed from the valley, swiftly traversing the plain, and entered the auspicious clouds in a flash.</p><p>The radiant light within was even more intense.  They channeled their spiritual energy to protect their eyes, severely limiting their vision.  Qin Sang, however, was an exception. He used his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to scout ahead and found no signs of other people.</p><p>"Whether this cloud disturbance is a coincidence or orchestrated by demons, we should wait a little longer for the cloud paths to appear before proceeding," Zhijiejian Zhenren transmitted his message.</p><p>The four nodded silently, following Zhijiejian Zhenren deeper into the auspicious clouds, then stopped to wait.</p><p>Soon, the inner turmoil subsided, the radiant light diminished, and after some time, a cloud path materialized before them.</p>
