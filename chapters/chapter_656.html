<h1>Chapter 648: Butterfly Hunt</h1><p>Chapter 648: Butterfly Hunt</p><p>Only one piece of Red Fire Gilded remained. Qin Sang placed it in a crevice by a small stream.</p><p>Dawn was approaching, the light at its dimmest.</p><p>The Butterfly Valley, bustling all night, seemed somewhat peaceful.</p><p>A flock of butterflies flew over the stream.</p><p>Suddenly, all the butterflies above this section of the stream froze, maintaining their flying poses, suspended in mid-air, motionless.</p><p>Time seemed to stop.</p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared on the stream bank.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the butterflies, then fell upon the riverbank stones. He hesitated for a moment, then reached out and beckoned. A butterfly, shaped like a small white butterfly, flew out of the crevice.</p><p>It was small, its snow-white wings speckled with black spots—a very common type of butterfly.</p><p>Frightened, it flew blindly, but an invisible barrier seemed to surround it, blocking all escape routes, bringing it before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the small white butterfly. Even at this close distance, he still couldn't see any flaws.</p><p>He was certain: it was a Sky Eye Butterfly!</p><p>The moment he sensed the Red Fire Gilded disappear, he used his spiritual sense to seal this space.  Originally, there were no butterflies in the crevice; only after the space was sealed did this small white butterfly suddenly appear.</p><p>Only the Sky Eye Butterfly possessed such powerful concealment and camouflage abilities.</p><p>"Finally caught a spirit insect, not easy,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, sighing with relief. After tirelessly searching six locations, he finally had some gain; otherwise, he would have had to return with only a silk worm.</p><p>Having captured the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to refine it into a life-bound insect Gu.  He still had two places left to check, and perhaps there were better choices.</p><p>Recalling the restrictions used by the Imperial Spirit Sect to confine spirit insects, Qin Sang chose one and cast a series of restrictions onto the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly didn't give up struggling.</p><p>It seemed to sense the danger of the restriction, struggled for a while, and seeing its futility, became more agitated. It changed its form, transforming into a beautiful swallowtail butterfly, attempting to deceive him.</p><p>The transformation was incredibly fast; the small white butterfly disappeared the instant the swallowtail butterfly appeared.  It was hard to notice if one wasn't paying close attention.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. "Such a naive spirit insect, still lacking in wisdom."</p><p>This further confirmed the butterfly's identity for him.</p><p>After a while, the restriction was complete, and the small white butterfly abandoned its disguise, reverting to its original form.</p><p>"A second-stage Sky Eye Butterfly… seemingly in the late second stage. No wonder its concealment ability is so strong."</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the small white butterfly, making it land on his fingertip.</p><p>Everything matched the ancient texts. The Sky Eye Butterfly's true form was breathtakingly beautiful; it seemed bathed in sky-blue light. Any other butterfly in the Butterfly Valley would pale in comparison.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly's wings had concentric circular patterns, already very close to the pattern of an eye. Once its third transformation was complete, the Sky Eye would open.</p><p>Qin Sang fed the Sky Eye Butterfly a few drops of spirit fruit juice, released the other butterflies, glanced back at the still-beautiful Butterfly Valley, and left contentedly.</p><p>…</p><p>Hundred Legs Village.</p><p>A peculiar name, yet widely known in Western Xinjiang.</p><p>Xiong Mountain region is remote, located in the far northwest corner of Western Xinjiang, a barren land most cultivators avoid. Hundred Legs Village is in the southern part of Xiong Mountain region, far away, the largest and most powerful village accessible in Xiong Mountain region.</p><p>Nearby Wu-tribe cultivators would choose to trade and gather information in Hundred Legs Village.</p><p>It was equivalent to the market town in the Xiaohan domain’s cultivator world.</p><p>Qin Sang, dusty and travel-worn, appeared at the foot of Hundred Legs Village, looking upward.</p><p>Hundred Legs Village's scale was comparable to a city.  Rows of stilt houses stood close together, with obvious Wu-tribe architectural style, occupying the entire mountain range. It was countless times larger than Yiyi Viper Village.</p><p>The market was built on the highest peak of Hundred Legs Village. Several factions and trade guilds from Western Xinjiang had established outposts there, including the guild Cui Xuanzi interacted with most frequently.</p><p>By then, over a month had passed since Qin Sang left Butterfly Valley.</p><p>As expected, the last two locations were empty, without any spirit insects. Qin Sang didn't want to wander the wilderness any longer, so he directly flew back on his sword.</p><p>This trip, including travel and capturing spirit insects, took almost four months, yielding only the silk worm and the Sky Eye Butterfly, and that was only because he had the Red Fire Gilded.</p><p>Of course, his high standards played a part in this.</p><p>Upon his return, Qin Sang didn't rush back to Xiong Mountain region, instead heading to Hundred Legs Village first.</p><p>Before his departure, Qin Sang had visited Hundred Legs Village once and met with several guild managers.</p><p>Most of the information about these nine types of spirit insects came from them.</p><p>Before his departure, Qin Sang paid a large sum of spirit stones in advance, asking them to use their various channels to investigate some matters.</p><p>Four months should be enough for them to gather information.</p><p>Qin Sang put on a hooded cloak and activated the *Dunling Jue* technique, disguising himself as a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Being a newcomer, he had many secrets, and as a human, he didn't want to interact too early with Wu cultivators whose cultivation surpassed his own.  He didn't want to risk them discovering his true identity.</p><p>The saying "those of different races will always have different hearts" is particularly true in the Canglang Sea region.</p><p>The conflict between the Wu and human races never ceases.  Only after leaving the Western Frontier and interacting with humans did Qin Sang dare to act so freely. In Wu territory, discretion was the better part of valor.</p><p>It's said that the chieftain of the Hundred-legged Village is a Nascent Soul stage expert, but this person's cave is not located in the village. Qin Sang, using the *Dunling Jue*, was not afraid of being discovered by others.</p><p>Having completed his disguise, Qin Sang walked up the mountain.  He encountered other cultivators along the way, most of whom were hurrying about.</p><p>Upon entering the Hundred-legged Village, Qin Sang proceeded directly and confidently to a grand wooden building.</p><p>The Bai Shan Trading Company sign hung prominently on the building.</p><p>Qin Sang paused momentarily before entering the building. Inside, the hall displayed various magical artifacts and spirit pills, attended by a dozen Wu maids with exotic appearances.</p><p>Displaying his Foundation Establishment cultivation, a maid led him to meet the Bai manager of the Bai Shan Trading Company.</p><p>"Friend Cultivator, you're back so soon looking for insects? Have you had any success?"</p><p>The Bai manager remembered Qin Sang; few people made such unusual requests.</p><p>"I spent almost two months in the two places you mentioned, but I didn't even see a shadow of a spirit insect.  Do you really think I could catch any?"</p><p>Qin Sang pretended to be angry, his tone unfriendly.</p><p>The Bai manager calmly sipped his tea, smiling. "Friend Cultivator, haven't you forgotten? I made it clear beforehand that the list of spirit insects you gave me was extremely peculiar—mostly those at the very end of the Wu Insect List. Only the disciples of the top sects on Wu God Mountain would dare use these insects as their spirit insect familiars. Few people in the Western Frontier seek them out, and the information cannot be guaranteed accurate. Your empty-handed return was to be expected; there's no need to be angry."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, ceasing to argue. "What about the information I asked you to investigate?  Do you have any results?"</p>
