<h1>Chapter 1336: The Variable</h1><p>Chapter 1336: The Variable</p><p>The underground caverns of the Bewitching Grotto are incredibly complex, twisting and turning, seemingly endless.  However, by focusing solely on descending, one can find the hidden chamber.</p><p>With inner turmoil and earth spirits blocking the way outside, the journey is far from easy.</p><p>Another tunnel within the Bewitching Grotto.</p><p>Su Nu and the others are making rapid progress.</p><p>This time, Elder Ye leads the way.</p><p>He appears even more relaxed than Qin Sang.</p><p>Elder Ye, having reached the Yuan Ying stage, possesses a far superior temperament to cultivators at the Golden Core stage. He can easily shield himself from the influences without resorting to secret techniques or magical artifacts.</p><p>He moves through the tunnel as if strolling, his hand raised, fingers spinning like a wheel, emitting delicate, hair-like needles of energy that effortlessly pierce skulls and explode within the earth spirits.</p><p>The needles' power isn’t particularly devastating, but Elder Ye's control is masterful, a level unattainable by most Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Elder Ye alone protects Su Nu and the others; their speed surpasses that of Qin Sang and Ming Wei.</p><p>They slay countless earth spirits.</p><p>The seemingly inexhaustible, elusive earth spirits suddenly vanish.</p><p>Elder Ye pauses slightly before continuing.</p><p>He's essentially revisiting familiar territory. Eventually, Elder Ye and his group reach the tunnel's end, entering a vast subterranean chamber.</p><p>The floor is paved with smooth tiles, the chamber eerily silent.</p><p>Thanks to Elder Ye, they are the first cultivators to arrive.</p><p>Except for Su Nu, the other three reveal their excitement and anticipation, their gazes fixed on the chamber's center.</p><p>Black mist drifts through the chamber, but at that spot, a soft, blue glow is faintly visible.</p><p>The source of the light is a semi-circular dome. Inside the dome sits a simple, square stone dais, bathed in blue light.</p><p>On the dais, four jade bottles are arranged in a row, containing spirit liquid that reflects the blue light, even more striking than the dome itself.</p><p>“That's the Soul-Washing Liquid…”</p><p>The alluring woman's eyes are filled with fascination.</p><p>The blue dome seems to contain the world's most beautiful scenery, and the jade bottles are treasures that captivate the soul.</p><p>This is indeed the case.</p><p>They are soon to face the bottleneck of Nascent Soul cultivation, a tribulation that terrifies all cultivators.</p><p>The Soul-Washing Liquid offers a chance of breakthrough, making it a priceless treasure for late-stage Golden Core cultivators!</p><p>However, obtaining the Soul-Washing Liquid requires overcoming a final obstacle—breaking the dome!</p><p>“Wait! Why are there only four bottles of Soul-Washing Liquid?”</p><p>The elder with the long beard snaps out of his trance, noticing the unusual number.</p><p>When the Seven Killing Hall opens, the Bewitching Grotto usually holds around ten bottles of Soul-Washing Liquid. Why so few this time?</p><p>“Master, this…”</p><p>The long-bearded elder is perplexed, looking to Elder Ye for an answer.</p><p>Elder Ye had already noticed the anomaly. He had personally experienced a Soul-Washing Liquid scramble where twelve bottles were present, eventually divided among several major factions.</p><p>Now, only four bottles? It’s not nearly enough to share!</p><p>“Four bottles! There have been suspicions that this Soul-Washing Liquid isn’t a naturally occurring substance; that the trial realm holds unknown secrets!  It seems there’s foul play afoot. The inner chamber appeared prematurely, and the amount of Soul-Washing Liquid is less than half of what it was in previous years!”</p><p>Elder Ye, seemingly expecting this, remains unfazed, coldly snorting, “I intended to take what I could get and avoid conflict with other factions, to avoid unnecessary trouble. It seems that is no longer possible. Four bottles, one for each of you. There’s no need to share.”</p><p>Elder Ye's tone is calm, treating the Soul-Washing Liquid as a foregone conclusion, something entirely expected.</p><p>His disciples' expressions are far from relaxed; instead, they feel a deep unease.</p><p>Outside, even more blood bats wouldn't be a match for Elder Ye.</p><p>But this is within the trial realm.</p><p>The long-bearded elder hesitates, “Master, while seizing the Soul-Washing Liquid would be effortless for you, the trial realm's restrictions limit your strength, forcing you to suppress your cultivation. Among our opponents, the Blood Bats and Daoist Xiao Yun are top-tier Golden Core cultivators.  The others are also elite disciples from major factions, their strength not to be underestimated.  There are those waiting to take advantage of the situation. If we try to monopolize the Soul-Washing Liquid, we will become everyone's target. Then…”</p><p>Elder Ye is limited within the trial realm and must suppress his cultivation; his strength is significantly reduced after being wounded during the crossing of the Immortal Ban.</p><p>Of course, even with their self-cultivated power, Blood Bat and Daoist Xiao Yun are no match for Master Ye.  However, if Master Ye makes too many enemies and is besieged, he'll be overwhelmed.</p><p>Master Ye, keenly aware of the elders' concerns, smiled slightly. "To counteract the restrictions of this trial realm, I cannot recklessly use my Yuan Ying power. However, with preparation, I can temporarily unleash a portion of my strength, delivering a single blow with the power of a Yuan Ying cultivator.  The tasks following the retrieval of the Cleansing Soul Liquid require my Yuan Ying power. Otherwise, what's the point of my risking my life to infiltrate this place?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was overjoyed, their doubts completely dispelled. Even a single attack would suffice.</p><p>Master Ye surveyed his disciples, saying calmly, "The Cleansing Soul Liquid is guarded by Earth Spirits, and they're strong. We must simultaneously defend against the Earth Spirits and attack the protective barrier until the seal is broken.  Then, I will strike unexpectedly to seize the Cleansing Soul Liquid.  Once I succeed, immediately come to my aid and retreat with me.  Once we're inside the cave, navigating the complex terrain, others will find it difficult to surround us."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"  The elders responded, their spirits lifted. After all, they were vying for a chance at enlightenment.</p><p>"Before that, your priority is self-preservation. How well do you control the array flags I gave you?" Master Ye asked.</p><p>"Master, I can now unleash about 70% of the array's power!" replied the elder, along with the other disciples, each holding an array flag.</p><p>Master Ye nodded, giving them a few more instructions.</p><p>At that moment, footsteps echoed from another passage, and several figures emerged.  The dark mist obscured their features, but a distinct crimson glow was noticeable.</p><p>"Blood Bat arrived first! Those with him must be other demonic cultivators!"  The elder's face fell, his voice a hushed warning.</p><p>After Blood Bat's appearance, footsteps and whooshes of air sounded from other passages. Other cultivators arrived, emerging from various openings.  The most powerful figures from various factions had gathered in the cavern.</p><p>"What? Only four portions!"</p><p>Someone exclaimed upon seeing the Cleansing Soul Liquid, causing a collective gasp of surprise.  Others noticed the anomaly and their expressions turned grave. The cavern seethed with tension.  They sensed the fierce competition ahead.</p>
