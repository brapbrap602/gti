<h1>Chapter 1696: The Great Five Elements Sealing and Severing Divine Light</h1><p>A Nascent Soul puppet? Mo Xingdao immediately felt alarmed, his expression changing. Saint Huiguang pretended not to notice, continuing, “The Heavenly Dao’s demonic resonance is like a thorn in our backs. Even we Nascent Soul cultivators are trapped beasts, but we are unwilling to submit to slaughter. The East Sea’s Return to Ruin still offers a glimmer of hope. This poor monk and the Saint King will settle our affairs and then journey east for ascension, not lingering in this realm for long. Time is running out. Even with the combined efforts of our two races, it’s impossible to refine a Nascent Soul stage puppet from scratch. This poor monk has observed Fellow Daoist Mo's puppet.  A mere Nascent Infant level, yet it has comprehended the Yin-Yang Escape Technique, demonstrating extraordinary potential. This poor monk and the Saint King are willing to fully support Fellow Daoist in refining your puppet to the next level!” As a lone cultivator, Mo Xingdao had weathered countless storms and experienced both immense success and crushing defeat.</p><p>His tempered spirit allowed him to swiftly regain his composure, restoring his reason and ability to think. He realized the true purpose of the two Nascent Soul experts.</p><p>So, they had their eyes on his puppet! However, no hardship could compare to the despair brought by the Heavenly Dao’s demonic resonance. Mo Xingdao was engulfed by the hopelessness revealed in Saint Huiguang's words, finding it hard to extricate himself.</p><p>He was somewhat lost and bewildered. Any grand cultivator, upon hearing this, would likely react similarly.</p><p>They had dedicated their lives to arduous cultivation, single-mindedly pursuing their goal of breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, forsaking readily available glory and pleasure.</p><p>Ascension! Transcendence! Now that their goal had crumbled, everything they had pursued had lost its meaning. Could they truly abandon their yearning for the Dao, indulge in worldly desires, or even lead a dissolute and muddled existence for the rest of their lives?</p><p>Did the two Nascent Soul experts want him to surrender his puppet willingly, or did they intend to offer something in exchange? Countless thoughts flashed through Mo Xingdao's mind.</p><p>The Ambrosia Zen Monastery was the leading Buddhist sect, a dominant force in the cultivation world, and surely capable of offering various enticing conditions. Yet, apart from ascension, nothing could pique his interest in the slightest!</p><p>"Ancient Demons! Savage Beasts!" A flash of inspiration struck Mo Xingdao. He blurted out, "Since it's a demonic resonance, you captured the Ancient Demons. Didn't you learn anything from them? And the frenzied Savage Beasts in the Storm Belt, could it be because something happened to their nests?" Seeing Mo Xingdao regain his composure so quickly and grasp the key points, Saint Huiguang couldn't help but regard him with higher esteem. He explained, "Regarding the source of the Heavenly Dao’s demonic resonance, there are currently two speculations: First, the demonic resonance existed originally, and the Immortal Palace was the instrument suppressing it, protecting the living beings of this realm. With the Immortal Palace’s ascension, this realm lost its protector, exposing us to the threat directly. If this is the case, the transformation may have just begun, and no one knows whether it will ultimately lead to the collapse of the barrier and the extinction of all life. The second speculation is that the Immortal Palace’s ascension caused turmoil in this realm, leading to an unknown change in the depths of the Return to Ruin, which is the true source of the demonic resonance. Savage Beasts originally dwelled in the East Sea's Return to Ruin and typically wouldn't roam elsewhere. The Return to Ruin is the most mysterious and unpredictable place in this realm. To this day, no one has been able to explore its depths. Countless Nascent Soul predecessors have ventured there, one after another, only managing to painstakingly forge a path to the Beacon Gate." Saint Huiguang paused, allowing Mo Xingdao to digest these secrets, before continuing, "This poor monk has already ordered people to closely monitor the Storm Belt and strive to capture a Savage Beast alive. As for the Ancient Demons... recently, this poor monk and the Saint King have been trying to help them regain their lucidity. We eventually discovered that the Ancient Demons and the Artifact Spirit seem to be one, and at least three different consciousnesses have fused within them, devouring each other, further compounded by the assault of the Heavenly Dao’s demonic resonance. Their minds are utterly chaotic, consumed by madness, and their intelligence may have been completely annihilated. It would likely take at least a few hundred years, or even longer, to have a sliver of hope of restoring them. Moreover, with the persistent presence of the Heavenly Dao's demonic resonance, it's practically impossible." As he spoke, Saint Huiguang led Mo Xingdao into an inner chamber where he saw the demonic body impaled on the Demon Sealing Stake.</p><p>The demonic body's appearance had become even more horrifying and gruesome. Its flesh was swollen, its features distorted, its blood and flesh twisted, resembling a terrifying ball of meat.</p><p>Through some unknown means employed by the two Nascent Soul experts, the demonic body had calmed down, no longer roaring. But Mo Xingdao could still sense the madness emanating from within.</p><p>Previously, they had all attributed this to demonic corruption, but now they knew the Heavenly Dao's demonic resonance was the true culprit. Saint Huiguang didn't conceal the demonic body's condition from Mo Xingdao, and he also explained their intentions in detail.</p><p>"With the Artifact Spirit losing consciousness, its resistance and rejection of external forces have weakened. This poor monk and the Saint King have contemplated this for a long time. Drawing inspiration from the Formless Immortal Sect's method of controlling artifacts with formations, there should be a considerable chance of manipulating this treasure. One of the Five Elements Crown's most potent abilities is called the Great Five Elements Sealing and Severing Divine Light. 'Sealing' for restraint, 'Severing' for reversal. The reversed Five Elements Divine Light focuses on annihilation, as we experienced during the Demon Subjugation War. The true Five Elements Divine Light excels at sealing, unparalleled among all treasures in the world. It's what this poor monk and the Saint King value most. When encountering Savage Beasts in the Return to Ruin, using the Five Elements Sealing to restrain them allows for a swift escape, preventing further danger. However..." Saint Huiguang's tone shifted, becoming solemn. "Precisely because the Artifact Spirit is driven mad, using the Five Elements Crown will subject one to its influence, requiring multiple people to share the burden."</p><p>"So, my puppet is indispensable to you two seniors." Mo Xingdao smiled wryly, knowing he had no power to resist. He straightforwardly asked, "How do you seniors intend to have me offer up my puppet...?" Saint Huiguang looked at him deeply and said, "It depends on whether that puppet is your Life-Bound Puppet or not." Mo Xingdao replied quietly, "What if it's not a Life-Bound Puppet?"</p><p>"This poor monk and the Saint King will offer treasures, satisfying all your requests within our capabilities. From then on, you will be free to roam the continent and the East Sea, and no one will dare to trouble you. The Ambrosia Zen Monastery and the Mo family descendants will form an eternal alliance..." Saint Huiguang spoke eloquently.</p><p>These promises would have sent others into ecstasy. But Mo Xingdao didn't even bother to blink.</p><p>"What if it *is* a Life-Bound Puppet?" And this was precisely the reason why the two Nascent Soul experts had spent so much time explaining things to him.</p><p>The difference between a Life-Bound Puppet and an ordinary puppet was significant. Similar to a Life-Bound Magical Treasure, it was intimately connected to its master, their foundations intertwined. If the master perished, the puppet's power would plummet, and its potential would be exhausted.</p><p>If they hadn't suspected it was Mo Xingdao's Life-Bound Puppet, something they couldn't forcibly seize, they could simply threaten him to surrender the puppet, confident in his compliance.</p><p>Even if Saint Huiguang, concerned about his reputation as the leader of the righteous path, was hesitant to openly engage in such blatant coercion, he still had numerous methods of intimidation and enticement at his disposal.</p><p>“With only the threat of the Heavenly Dao's demonic resonance, we still have the power to resist. I've heard that puppetry has a secret technique similar to Soul Fusion. We will fully assist in advancing your puppet further. If you use the Soul Fusion secret technique to merge with your puppet, thereby controlling the power of a Nascent Soul stage puppet, could you perhaps circumvent the Heavenly Tribulation?” Saint Huiguang posed a counter-question.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's expression changed upon hearing this.</p><p>"With insufficient cultivation, forcibly fusing with a puppet will inevitably result in backlash. Even if one succeeds in controlling it temporarily, the consequences are dire. At best, future progress will be stunted; at worst, one will lose oneself, truly becoming a mindless puppet!" Saint Huiguang stared at him, silent.</p><p>Mo Xingdao quickly calmed down, realizing that this proposal might be the best option for him.</p><p>Recalling True Person Zilei's fate, Mo Xingdao didn't believe his own mental fortitude surpassed his. Attempting a breakthrough on his own would be a dead end.</p><p>The normal path of Nascent Soul breakthrough and ascension was blocked. He had to find another way. First, escape the confines of this realm. Once he reached the upper realms and encountered a broader world, he could then seek solutions to the lingering dangers. It was a measure born of desperation.</p><p>Even without the pressure from the Nascent Soul experts, this was his only remaining path.  Saint Huiguang and Saint King Qinghu's willingness to help him refine his puppet was a fortuitous opportunity he couldn't refuse.  Relying solely on himself, even with his Life-Bound Puppet fused with the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal, it would be extremely difficult to advance the puppet while he was still at the Nascent Infant stage.</p><p>If he missed this chance, after the two Nascent Soul experts departed, he wouldn’t find such help again.</p><p>Seeing Mo Xingdao's silence, Saint Huiguang continued, "If Fellow Daoist has sufficient confidence, we can also assist you in forcefully breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage. With a puppet protecting you, you might have a slightly better chance of surviving the Heavenly Tribulation than others. However, if Fellow Daoist fails the tribulation and falls before the Heart Devil Tribulation, this poor monk and the Saint King will use a secret technique to extract your remaining True Essence, infusing it into the puppet, allowing it to temporarily avoid regression and enabling us to control it. Of course, this secret technique cannot last forever. Fellow Daoist needn't worry about being perpetually controlled by us, never to be free."  A chilling coldness permeated Saint Huiguang's words, sending shivers down one's spine.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was puzzled.</p><p>"Why must it be this way? Can't we wait until my Life-Bound Puppet reaches the Nascent Soul stage, allowing me to control it and accompany you two seniors?" Saint King Qinghu, who had remained silent until now, let out a scoff, saying disdainfully, "Delusional!  Not to mention the unimaginable dangers within the depths of the Return to Ruin, the simplest issue is that the spiritual pressure there is not something a mere Nascent Infant can withstand. You'll explode before even reaching the Beacon Gate..."  Saint Huiguang nodded slightly.</p><p>"Over countless years, numerous Nascent Soul predecessors have perished in the Return to Ruin.  The path to the Beacon Gate is fraught with peril.  This poor monk and the Saint King will have our hands full. Even with a puppet's protection, Fellow Daoist's safety cannot be guaranteed." ...Savage Prefecture.</p><p>Bottom of the Poison Lake. Weeping Spirit Cave Master's former cave dwelling. Qin Sang’s avatar and Ghost Mother arrived to meet him. His true body and Liuli sensed their presence and came out to greet them.</p><p>Entering the cave, Ghost Mother's eyes lit up when she saw Liuli. She sized her up, clicking her tongue in admiration, then glanced at Qin Sang with a sly smile.</p><p>"What a stunning beauty! No wonder you lingered so long, forgetting all about the poor souls waiting for you back home!"  This wasn't the first time Qin Sang had experienced Ghost Mother's sharp tongue, but his face still stiffened slightly. Who would have thought that an expert who had lived since ancient times could be so unrestrained in her speech.</p><p>And she certainly had the power to back up her words. He glanced sideways at Liuli, seeing her frown but not yet angered.  Qin Sang quickly ushered Ghost Mother inside, changing the subject to ease the atmosphere.</p><p>It just so happened that he had many questions for Ghost Mother. Through his avatar's awareness, Qin Sang already knew about occupying Luye and controlling the Nether Moon Guard. He also knew he now had two more disciples-in-name, forming the beginnings of a faction.</p><p>He hadn't intended to establish a force in Central Prefecture, yet he had been gradually pushed into this position. In the future, he might as well establish a Green Ram Temple branch in Central Prefecture.  Senior Wandering Cloud wouldn't mind seeing his lineage spread there.</p><p>The cultivation techniques and secret arts Qin Sang had acquired from the Formless Immortal Sect alone were enough to support an entire sect. Luye, though small, could serve as a temporary sect grounds.</p><p>However, he still had many unresolved issues, matters he could address later.  After the initial greetings, Qin Sang focused his mind within his Qi Sea, invoking the Cloud Wanderer Sword's intent. He enveloped the slumbering Gu King with the Poison Pearl and slowly drew it out of his body.</p><p>"This venomous insect was something this junior obtained by chance. I haven't found a way to deal with it yet, and there's also the risk of exposure, which is quite troublesome.  Please, Senior, take a look." Recalling his encounter at Emperor Bestowal Mountain, he knew the Poison King had means of tracking the Gu King.  During this period, Qin Sang and Liuli had remained vigilant, closely monitoring news from the legacy cave, ready to flee at any moment.</p><p>Perhaps Ghost Mother had a way to tame the Gu King? The Gu King remained asleep, its body pure white. Qin Sang briefly described the Gu King’s abilities and origins.</p><p>"It's Gu refinement," Ghost Mother nodded.  Unafraid of the Gu King suddenly spewing poisonous light, she reached out her right hand and pinched the Gu King between two fingers, bringing it close for careful examination.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Ghost Mother's pupils shimmer like stars, emitting an unusual light. He sat quietly, not daring to disturb her.</p><p>A quarter of an hour later, Ghost Mother blinked, her pupils returning to normal. She said, "A rather crude Gu refinement technique, but it does have its merits.  From my observation, it appears someone forcibly channeled a certain power, grafting it onto the Gu insect through Gu refinement, thus granting it new vitality. The other party's ability to track it is also based on this connection, but they must be within a certain range to sense it. Finding you isn't that easy." After pondering for a moment, Ghost Mother added, "This matter isn't difficult to resolve." Then, Ghost Mother instructed Qin Sang to withdraw his sword intent.</p><p>Sensing the change in its surroundings, the Gu King's wings trembled, about to awaken.  Ghost Mother flicked her fingers repeatedly, sending puffs of white mist toward the Gu King, quickly enveloping it. Then, she clapped her hands together, and the mist abruptly contracted.</p><p>The Gu King's jade-like body was imprinted with mottled patterns, resembling naturally formed cloud markings. Qin Sang reapplied his sword intent to suppress it.</p><p>Ghost Mother said, "This venomous insect has had its potential exhausted by the crude Gu refinement technique. Its intelligence is minimal, and it has no chance of advancement unless it encounters a heaven-defying opportunity.  Of course, it still poses a significant threat to at least Nascent Infant cultivators.  However, if your ambitions extend beyond that, it's better to let the Poison Pearl devour it. The Poison Pearl, formed from the divine abilities comprehended by the Lazy Silkworm, which possesses the Divine Silkworm bloodline, has far greater potential than this insect." Ghost Mother's words coincided with Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>With Ghost Mother's guidance, Qin Sang could finally make up his mind. However, the Gu King's poisonous light was so potent. If the Poison Pearl devoured it and only enhanced his poison resistance, it would be somewhat of a waste.</p><p>The Poison Warding Armor had a limited range, and poison users were rare in the cultivation world.  Its current power was already adequate.</p><p>If he could tame the Gu King, it would be better to utilize it for a while. He could let the Poison Pearl devour it when he reached the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang consulted Ghost Mother on this matter. Unexpectedly, she glanced at him sideways, saying, "Having devoured so many poisonous substances, only to be used for poison resistance?  The Divine Silkworm bloodline isn't that simple. I later discovered that the Lazy Silkworm's true divine abilities, even those related to the Dao of Poison, haven't been fully awakened.  Do as I say, let the Poison Pearl devour the Gu King, and you'll naturally be able to wield virulent poisons." </p>
