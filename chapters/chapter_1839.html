<h1>Chapter 1830 The Dao</h1><p>Compared to the spoils of war, Qin Sang's greatest gain was his understanding of cultivation techniques and the Dao of Killing.  He meticulously sorted and stored his loot, then sat in meditation, circulating his cultivation technique, silently reflecting on the insights gained from that battle.</p><p>Slaying the Azure Fox Saint King.</p><p>Forcing Xia Hou to self-destruct.</p><p>Settling old and new grudges at once.</p><p>More importantly, the exhilarating feeling of exerting his utmost strength, overcoming a formidable foe, and seizing the ultimate treasure.  Every time he recalled it, Qin Sang felt an urge to let out a long roar to express his feelings.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the mindset of the predecessor who created the "Meta-spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter" at the Nascent Soul stage.  He did not desire to kill, nor did he fear killing. The sword dealt with cause and effect; sheathe the blade and leave!</p><p>This mindset revealed the predecessor's Dao, which was also the Dao of cultivation techniques. Understanding this mindset would greatly aid Qin Sang in comprehending the technique.</p><p>Looking back on his past cultivation, before the Nascent Soul stage, he had been killing incessantly, his killing intent soaring, and the Killing Talisman worked without hindrance; there were no bottlenecks between minor realms.  At the Nascent Soul stage, however, Qin Sang had relied on the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and the Buddha Bone Relic, two external objects, to break through; he had not felt the technique's assistance.</p><p>Looking back now, it wasn't that Qin Sang hadn't understood the Dao within the technique, but that the predecessor was struggling amidst the slaughter, in a state of confusion, wavering between killing and not killing.  This confusion was also a confusion about the Dao.</p><p>Ghost Mother said that the Nascent Soul stage is the beginning of entering the Dao; how true these words were.</p><p>Ultimately, the predecessor established their own Dao, sheathed their sword, and entered the Transformation stage!</p><p>Comprehending the predecessor's mindset at that time is guidance towards the Dao, greatly aiding the comprehension of the cultivation technique.</p><p>So, what choice would the predecessor make above the Void Refinement stage? Would they continue this Dao, or would there be a new transformation?</p><p>Also, what is the Dao of "Heavenly Demon Transformation"?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, thinking about "Heavenly Demon Transformation." The biggest characteristic of this technique is the birth of a Dharma Image projection during the Nascent Soul stage.  Now, Qin Sang knew the power of the Dharma Image, a great divine ability that should only be obtained after the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>He had obtained the Dharma Image so early, perhaps related to the Azure Luan's blood, but ordinary techniques certainly couldn't do it. The Dharma Image, perhaps, is the Dao of this technique.</p><p>Having guidance towards the Dao at the beginning of entering the Dao, guiding cultivators towards their direction and preventing them from going astray.  This, perhaps, is the difference between top-tier cultivation techniques and ordinary ones!</p><p>Collecting his scattered thoughts, Qin Sang returned to the "Meta-spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter," and after careful contemplation, he couldn't help but feel joyful. As expected, the gains from this battle were immense.  His opponents included not only Transformation stage late-stage powerhouses, but also enemies, all slain by his hand.  For anyone else at the Transformation stage early-stage, facing a Transformation stage late-stage powerhouse would only mean running for their life.  It's conceivable how much this battle helped Qin Sang comprehend the cultivation technique.</p><p>Although his cultivation hadn't reached it yet, Qin Sang vaguely felt that there wouldn't be many obstacles before breaking through to the Transformation stage mid-stage.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, got up, left the cave, inspected the flower field, and gathered freshly matured flower essence.  Next, he would focus on diligent cultivation to break through to the Transformation stage mid-stage, which shouldn't be too difficult!</p><p>After this small interlude, Qin Sang continued his recovery. This time, his injuries healed quickly, fully recovered within less than a month.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang take out the Five Elements Crown.  This treasure was Qin Sang's greatest gain from this battle, besides his insights into cultivation techniques.</p><p>Five-colored light illuminated the cave; the five-colored crown floated quietly.  Qin Sang lowered his eyes, activating his divine sense which enveloped the Five Elements Crown, just as he was about to act, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he placed several array flags around, setting up a protective array, and then displayed the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, his Azure Luan Dharma Image standing ready, finally at ease.</p><p>He carefully probed the Five Elements Crown with his divine sense.</p><p>The spirit seemed to sense the intrusion of an outside force and emitted unusual fluctuations. Qin Sang's heart tightened; he slowed down, fortunately, as he had proactively accepted the demonic thoughts' invasion and mimicked the spirit's aura, it didn't provoke hostility. His movements became even gentler.</p><p>In Qin Sang's perception, he seemed to pass through layers of chaotic aura, approaching a mass of light filled with chaos and madness. This mass of light was the demonic spirit. To be precise, it was a fusion of the demonic spirit, Wu Dao's meta-spirit, and the demonic soul; at this moment, they were indistinguishable from one another.</p><p>'Looking' at this mass of light, Qin Sang hesitated. According to Mo Xing Dao, the mutual consumption was dominated by the demonic spirit, but Qin Sang couldn't sense the demonic spirit's intelligence.</p><p>After sensing for a long time, Qin Sang gained some understanding. It was likely that once the consumption was complete, and the three merged as one, a new intelligence would be born.  As for whether this intelligence would still be the original demonic spirit, no one could say for sure.</p><p>"I should be able to do something..."  Qin Sang mused to himself.</p><p>Outsiders dare not interfere with the spirit's consumption, mainly fearing contamination by its malevolent influence.  He, however, is unafraid, able to contact it with his spiritual sense without restraint, attempting to guide its consumption.</p><p>The spirit's chaotic intelligence is advantageous; like a blank canvas, it can be freely manipulated.</p><p>While guiding the spirit's consumption, he subtly leaves his mark, gradually influencing the spirit to recognize him, even aiming for complete subjugation.</p><p>If this treasure can evolve into a postnatal spiritual treasure, it will undoubtedly be a significant asset in the future.</p><p>Worth a try!</p><p>Of course, easier said than done.  The difficulty is immense.</p><p>Qin Sang only has a preliminary plan; its implementation requires careful consideration.</p><p>The process will inevitably be very long.</p><p>Before the consumption is complete, is there a way to control this treasure? Or create a new restriction?</p><p>Even if only a fraction of its power can be utilized, it would significantly boost his strength.</p><p>The blow from the Reverse Five Elements Divine Light that severely injured Xia Hou shows the treasure's power has vastly increased.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered intently, considering all possibilities.</p><p>Soon, he began his attempts in earnest.</p><p>In the quiet cave, multicolored light flickered, illuminating his face, sometimes thoughtful, sometimes furrowed.</p><p>Time slipped away quietly.</p><p>…</p><p>One year after the Mirror Space battle.</p><p>Qin Sang left the flower field for the first time, deciding to leave the Netherworld with Mo Xingdao.</p><p>It's rare for anyone to stay in the altar for so long. Qin Sang gave Mo Xingdao the pills the Swordmaster gave him to stabilize his soul, to alleviate his concerns.</p><p>Before leaving, however, he did the opposite, heading deeper into the altar.</p><p>Deliberately avoiding the Mirror Space, Qin Sang entered from another location, arriving at a relatively open area.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, transformed into a kingfisher, perched on his left shoulder.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>Mo Xingdao pointed with his wing towards Qin Sang's right.</p><p>Qin Sang followed, safely passing through several illusions, until he saw a huge mass of Xuanhuang Qi.</p><p>The Xuanhuang Qi gathered into a ball, roughly egg-shaped, with variations in density revealing the flow of the Qi within.</p><p>Qin Sang stared for a long time, sending Mo Xingdao back to the altar, activating the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, his body radiating a glassy light, before stepping into the mass.</p><p>The moment he entered the Xuanhuang Qi, a tremendous pressure bore down on him, far exceeding the suction in the Mirror Space.</p><p>'Crack… crack… crack…'</p><p>Even his powerful body creaked, his bones seeming to crack under the pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang grunted, immediately summoning his Qingluan Dharma image.  The Dharma image's power entered his body, resisting the pressure as he continued forward.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no other dangers. Qin Sang successfully traversed the Xuanhuang Qi, relieved.</p><p>He was already straining at this point, unsure how far he was from the Ascension Path.</p><p>The road ahead would undoubtedly be arduous; he needed a plan. This time he relied on Mo Xingdao for guidance.</p><p>He summoned Mo Xingdao again.</p><p>Mo Xingdao glanced around, immediately drawn to an illusion, exclaiming, "There! I remember! I saw these cinnabar and gold needles when I was thrown into this realm!"</p><p>Following Mo Xingdao's gaze, Qin Sang looked towards the upper left, where a strange phenomenon was reflected.</p><p>When the altar is stable, most illusions appear calm from the outside, their danger only revealed upon entry.  This was different.</p><p>Visible to the naked eye were millions of cinnabar and gold needles, hurtling towards each other in a chaotic clash.</p><p>Qin Sang approached and observed for a while, only to be disappointed. The spectacle was an illusion, a peculiar reflection from another location; the actual needles were not there.</p><p>Still, it was a major breakthrough. By finding the source of the reflected illusion, they could pinpoint the location of the cinnabar and gold needles.</p><p>They exchanged a hopeful glance.</p><p>Qin Sang, realizing the needles were not nearby and currently unreachable, decided against further exploration, and retreated with Mo Xingdao.</p><p>The man and his puppet quickly reached the edge of the altar, hiding in the auspicious clouds to observe the outside world.</p><p>Qin Sang had made several trips without detecting anything unusual, this time was no different, but he waited a year.</p><p>Atop the auspicious clouds, he used his celestial eye, surveying the heavens, finding no signs of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>He feared Hong Yuzi might have summoned a powerful cultivator.</p><p>After observing, Qin Sang cautiously emerged from the clouds, immediately turning north, making a wide detour, then heading south.</p><p>The journey was smooth, leading him directly to the Gu Shan altar.</p><p>Currently, the Gui Fang kingdom's landscape had drastically changed. The Yao gods' status had risen dramatically, particularly those daring enough to enter the Netherworld to gather followers.</p><p>Due to their relationship with the snake demons, the hyena demons’ status soared, becoming national advisors with numerous residences.</p><p>In a secluded manor, two strangers appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the demonic wolf, surveyed the manor, and nodded.  "This place is tranquil.  Please, Daoist Mo, make yourself at home. I will help you gather the materials for the ritual altar, hoping you can regain your strength soon."</p><p>Daoist Mo had been trained in the Daoist court.  His physical body had perished, but a remnant soul remained. Though the altar was destroyed, his techniques were not lost; he could rebuild it.  Returning to the Daoist court was impossible; he could only hide within the Demon Kingdom.</p><p>"I am deeply grateful!" Daoist Mo bowed deeply, his voice solemn.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled in response. In a way, Mo was similar to him; always vigilant, rarely trusting others.  This was likely why Mo spoke so sincerely.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intend to use this as leverage, viewing it as a transaction. Mo was far behind him in power; Qin Sang himself barely held on to life, let alone returning a favor.  How much longer could he survive with his soul fused into this puppet body?</p><p>Mo probably understood this; that's why he felt compelled to express his gratitude.</p><p>"Daoist Mo, before we proceed, let us make a karmic oath."</p><p>It wasn't that Qin Sang distrusted Mo, but the matter was of great importance; this conflict involved high-ranking officials from both the Gui Fang Kingdom and the Daoist court.  Caution was necessary.</p><p>Mo immediately agreed, "Certainly!"</p><p>The two performed a ritual, making a karmic oath, promising to cooperate sincerely and seek the path to ascension together.</p><p>After the oath, Qin Sang bowed. "Qin has some pressing matters and cannot stay long.  Until next time!"</p><p>"Safe travels, Daoist!"</p><p>After seeing Qin Sang off, Daoist Mo stood in the manor, lost in thought for a long time.</p><p>Outside the manor, Qin Sang gave a few instructions to the demonic wolf and then journeyed west, without stopping, until he reached Hu Zhong Island and Master Qi's residence.</p><p>Upon hearing of Qin Sang's arrival, Master Qi quickly emerged from his furnace room, his face full of reproach. "You've been gone far too long, Daoist!"</p><p>Qin Sang examined Master Qi, frowning, about to speak, when Master Qi grabbed his arm and hurried him into the furnace room.</p><p>"These years, I've been contemplating, and I have new ideas.  Quickly, bring out the Return Wind Armor!" Master Qi urged impatiently.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and produced the scroll.  "The Return Wind Armor is destroyed. It wasted your efforts, Master."</p><p>Master Qi was stunned, but instead of dismay, he showed joy, clapping his hands. "Excellent!  I've long felt the Return Wind Armor didn't quite match the True Treasure fragment. That last forging was rather reckless. I feared you wouldn't part with it."</p><p>He didn't consider the dangers Qin Sang faced, the fact that even the armor was destroyed, all for the True Treasure fragment.</p><p>Master Qi reached for the fragment, but Qin Sang stopped him, causing him to look up, questioning. Qin Sang's face was serious.</p><p>"Master, are you certain you can overcome this tribulation?" Qin Sang asked gravely, sensing the Heavenly Tribulation aura around Master Qi.</p><p>Master Qi's fervor faded, replaced by a wry smile and shake of his head. "During my last tribulation, I humbled myself and sought a technique to overcome it.  It was a life-or-death struggle, but I gained three hundred years of life out of it."</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow.</p><p>Having known Master Qi for years, Qin Sang admired him greatly,  The Return Wind Armor had saved him countless times.  Being relatively young, Qin Sang rarely worried about the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation and hadn’t actively collected any tribulation-defying treasures.  The tribulation-defying formation of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect required specific treasures and was designed for the Three Catastrophes Tribulation.  Unfortunately, Master Qi was still a long way from the peak of late Yuan Ying stage; he didn't have enough time left.</p><p>Master Qi admitted he'd hit a bottleneck, his cultivation stagnant for years. He was devoted to refining, likely unable to focus on cultivation. Otherwise, Qin Sang might have passed on the Tian Linglong refining technique; there might have been a chance to ascend to the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Master Qi took a deep breath. "Daoist, do not worry about me. You know my ambition. In this life, I will likely never create a spirit treasure, but refining the True Treasure fragment into an armor will be enough to comfort me, even in death!"</p><p>Qin Sang gazed into Master Qi's eyes. "The Daoist court might have tribulation-defying treasures. I have accumulated some merit..."</p><p>Before he finished, Master Qi suddenly stood, bowing deeply without a word.  "I hope you will grant my wish!"</p><p>He feared dying with regrets more than death itself.  In his remaining time, he'd rather do everything to create his greatest work before passing away peacefully.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a long time, then sighed softly and nodded slightly.</p><p>Master Qi smiled.</p><p>"Leave this here, Master.  I await good news," Qin Sang handed the True Treasure fragment to Master Qi.</p><p>"I won't disappoint you," Master Qi handled the scroll with care, "For the refining, I'll need your assistance. If you can wait, let's say thirty years from now."</p><p>"I'll follow your instructions, Master," Qin Sang replied, his tone heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed at Master Qi's residence, discussing the art of refinement, encouraging Master Qi to proceed boldly, assuring him he'd overcome any difficulties.</p><p>After more than ten days, Qin Sang left a large amount of spiritual materials and went to visit the Sword Heart Island and the Sword Master.</p>
