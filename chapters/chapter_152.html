Chapter 145: Seven Hero Passes


Fortunately, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is sealed by restrictions left by an ancient almighty, which can prevent cloud beasts from invading the Cold Domain.
I don't know if it was a deliberately left passage, or because the restriction has weakened over time, the ancient restriction now has some defects. The Cold Domain cultivators build passes in the damaged areas, firmly sealing the cloud beasts in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, sending their disciples to hunt them down, not letting them go south to destroy the normal world.
These passes are also the entrances and exits of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.
The introduction in the jade slip is more detailed.
There are seven largest passes on the edge of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Wan Yao City, Jiuyong Pass, Xuanluan Pass, Chun Gang City, Yin Shan Pass, Tian You and Qingyang, two cities.
In addition, there are also some small cities, all occupied by scattered cultivators or some immortal cultivating sects or families, large and small, varying.
Three of the seven passes are guarded by the eight orthodox sects, from west to east are Jiuyong, Xuanluan, Chun Gang. The large areas behind these passes, including the relics found inside, are naturally also in the control of the orthodox sects.
However, the area beyond that is a complete no-man's land, especially the area near the space rift, where temptation and danger coexist. Over the years, I don't know how many Golden Core cultivators have died inside.
In order to guard the passes, clean up the cloud beasts in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and explore the relics in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the major sects will recruit their disciples to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and Shaohua Mountain is no exception.
As for this, Sect Master Yu had already told him about it. Even if Qin Sang doesn't take the initiative to guard the pass, he will be conscripted sooner or later. Generally speaking, after staying there for at least 20 years, his task will be considered complete.
The Wan Yao City in the far west is exclusively occupied by the demon cultivators of Tian Yao Qiu. Although there is only one city, the area of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield behind the city extends all the way to the far west. Human cultivators can hardly reach it, and its range is not less than the area controlled by the orthodox sects.
There is also a big city between the passes controlled by the orthodox and demonic sects, called Yin Shan Pass. The city lord's strength is extraordinary, and it is said that he is also a great cultivator of the Nascent Soul Stage.
The orthodox and demonic sects seem to have reached a tacit understanding long ago, and they have not extended their reach here, using it as a buffer zone. As a result, the Yin Shan City is a mixed bag, with orthodox and demonic evil cultivators, unorthodox and heretical sects, and people from all walks of life.
The two passes in the far east, Tian You and Qingyang, are naturally in the hands of the demonic sects. There is not much information about these two cities in the jade slip.
The cultivators of the orthodox and demonic sects are also distinct in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, operating around their own passes and not daring to cross the border easily. The Xuanluan Pass, jointly guarded by Shaohua Mountain, Taiyi Danzong, and Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, is in the middle of the three orthodox cities and is still a long distance from the demonic sect, separated by Chun Gang and Yin Shan, two cities.
That's why Qin Sang dared to go to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.
You must know that the surviving Golden Core cultivator of that Kuiyin Sect is hiding in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Once Qin Sang's soul eater on the surface of his Nascent Soul enters the Golden Core cultivator's Divine Sense range, it will be detected.
The soul eater is like a sharp sword hanging above his head, constantly reminding him that the crisis has not yet been lifted. Entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he dared not leave Xuanluan Pass too far.
In addition, in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, one must act cautiously. If one accidentally encounters a group of cloud beasts and is besieged, it will be difficult for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to get the better of them.
Qin Sang also prepared to wait until he had accumulated a lot of experience before daring to have the intention of going to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. He only came here to get a general idea.
Qin Sang read the contents of the jade slips carefully, memorized it, and saw that it was getting late outside. He took the information of the two妖灵期妖兽, activated the Flying Shuttle, flew out of Shaohua Mountain, and flew south all the way.
With his heart hanging on the Nine Phantom Heavenly Orchid in his cave house, Qin Sang wished he could go back to the cave house every day to take a look, so he didn't delay for a moment and waited until he flew out of the Shaohua Mountain's control range before lowering his遁光 and 御剑 flew along the water surface.
On the way, he looked through the information of the two妖兽.
One is a snake妖, and the other is a white rhino, both of which are hidden in the depths of the Yun Cang Great Swamp.
Originally, they hid in the cave at the bottom of the water and cultivated quietly, and Shaohua Mountain did not discover their existence. It is a pity that these two妖兽 could not bear the loneliness.
The news of the snake妖 was reported by a senior brother surnamed Wang. He was sent by his sect to deal with a trivial matter in the Yun Cang Great Swamp. On the way back, he was suddenly attacked by the snake妖 while flying in the air.
Fortunately, Senior Brother Wang's strength was not weak. He still protected his vitals while caught off guard and injured the snake妖. However, this妖 was slippery and擅长 water escape technique. After Senior Brother Wang chased into the water, he lost it.

Brother Wang had to let it go for the time being as he was in a hurry to report back to the headmaster, but the more he thought about it after returning to the mountain, the angrier he became. He went back twice, but failed to capture the monster. However, he found a snake slough on an island, which suggested that the monster's cave was nearby, but it was very well hidden and difficult to find.

So Brother Wang reported this matter to the headmaster, leaving a map and claiming that if anyone among his fellow disciples had a way to find the monster and hunt it down, he would show his gratitude.

The white rhino monster was even more daring, and attacked a spiritual stone mine in Lesser Mount Hua.

The spiritual stone mine was on an island, and the vein extended to the bottom of the island. It was not very big, and now the spiritual stones in the mine were almost exhausted. Only some of the Qi Refining Stage disciples were left to guard the mine, squeezing out the last bit of value. Together with the restrictive阵法 left by the sect, it had been very peaceful all along.

Some time ago, a white rhino monster suddenly appeared from nowhere and attacked the spiritual stone mine without any warning.

The white rhino monster was a great monster in the Spirit Monster Stage, and the disciples guarding the mine vein were all Qi Refining Stage disciples. They were very frightened when they were suddenly attacked. They opened the great array in a panic and joined forces to resist.

The white rhino monster could not break through the great array at all, so it left after failing to make any progress. Only then did the disciples feel relieved.

The disciples waited for a while longer. When they saw that the white rhino monster still did not appear, they thought it had left. However, unexpectedly, one of the disciples was attacked by the white rhino monster just as he left the spiritual stone mine.

These two places were far apart, and Qin Sang adjusted his遁光 and flew towards the spiritual stone mine after some consideration.

Firstly, the information there was more accurate. Secondly, there were restrictive arrays in the spiritual stone mine, which made it possible to attack when necessary and defend when needed.

He still did not know how to cultivate and improve the Way of Killing. He did not know whether he should comprehend the state of mind in battle or experience a life-or-death situation to gain something. With the help of the restrictive arrays in the spiritual stone mine, he would be safer.

Qin Sang used sword遁 to travel. Except for finding a place to restore his spiritual power in the middle, he did not stop at all. He did not encounter any setbacks, and after half a month, he saw the island where the spiritual stone mine was located.

This island was much larger than the island of his cave. There was a bottomless canyon that ran almost from east to west across the entire island, which looked very abrupt.

At this moment, there was a golden light罩 over the canyon, and a faint light was shining. This was the guardian great array of the spiritual stone mine.

Qin Sang could vaguely see the figures of cultivators sitting below the light罩.
