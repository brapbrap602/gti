<h1>Chapter 2013: The Sage</h1><p>Qin Sang had envisioned many reunion scenarios, even the possibility of encountering senior cultivators who had ascended from the Storm World.  She never anticipated that her first 'reunion' would be with a spirit embryo she herself had refined.  Years ago, the Xu Ling Sect discovered a fire jade in the Mountains Within Mountains and cultivated a special fire spirit.  Sect Master Bing Han invited her and Xiang Qing of the Qingyang Sect to help refine it into a spirit treasure embryo, hoping to nurture a true spirit treasure for the Xu Ling Sect in the future.</p><p>This spirit embryo had somehow appeared in the Great Thousand World, already a pseudo-spirit treasure, on the verge of transformation.</p><p>Could the woman be a Xu Ling Sect disciple who ascended from the lower realms?</p><p>If someone had ascended to the Great Thousand World less than a millennium after she left the Storm World, did this mean not only was the Heavenly Demon Sound no longer a hindrance, but the ascension path from Gui Xu had also been restored?</p><p>Liuli, Qingyang Temple…could someone have already ascended to the Great Thousand World?</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The woman's jade blade had been snatched away, and she hadn't recovered from her shock when two gusts of chilling wind attacked from behind, two grey-blue streaks aimed at her back.</p><p>The blue streak was an ice arrow, smaller than the one shattered by the jade blade, but its light was purer and sharper, its power evidently far greater.  With the ice arrow came a blizzard.</p><p>Snowflakes fell as large as bowls, a torrent of cold air surging forth, freezing even the wind and sand, seeming to freeze everything in the world.</p><p>The grey streak was a pill, the size of a dragon's eye, surrounded by grey vapor, exuding a chilling aura.</p><p>The instant the pill approached the woman, the earth rumbled, sand dunes collapsed, and the desert split open. A surge of grey vapor erupted from the earth, shooting into the sky.</p><p>Within the vapor was a terrifying apparition: a gigantic grey-scaled serpent, its body as large as a mountain, its scales appearing to be composed of earth and stone. It swallowed the pill, unleashing a terrifying aura, and its long tail lashed out.</p><p>The earth seemed to become a carpet, vibrating rhythmically.  Powerful forces lifted the yellow sand, creating a terrifying dust storm to engulf the woman.</p><p>Above, snow and ice; below, a dust storm. The ice arrow and the grey-scaled serpent were upon her instantly, leaving her no escape.</p><p>Even without being distracted, escaping this intense attack would be no easy feat.</p><p>At this moment, the woman had no time to consider Qin Sang's question. Her survival instinct overpowered her fear, and she surged forward.  Her ceremonial robe was a magical garment that quickly transformed into a cloud banner, erupting in colorful mist, forming a protective aura around her.</p><p>But this was far from enough to save her. Then, she suddenly felt the ambient spiritual energy around her tremble.</p><p>In an instant, all sounds ceased.  The threats behind her vanished simultaneously.</p><p>The void transformed into a beautiful, tranquil painting, as if time itself had frozen.</p><p>The snow, the dust storm, the colorful mist—everything froze.  The ice arrow and the grey-scaled serpent were restrained by an invisible force, unable to move.</p><p>The two pursuers' scalps tingled; a chill far colder than the blizzard permeated their bodies.  Terror-stricken, they tried to retreat, but felt a terrifying pressure descend upon them.</p><p>The man in black robes who had launched the ice arrow spat out an oval-shaped piece of dark ice, its surface inscribed with countless runes—a protective treasure. But the dark ice only flickered with blue light before extinguishing.</p><p>Then, the black-robed man involuntarily flew towards Qin Sang.</p><p>His companion reacted faster, summoning a jade bracelet which transformed into a circle of protective light, but it was futile; the bracelet couldn't protect him, and he was dragged away.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The two men crashed to the ground, speechless.  Qin Sang hadn't even glanced at them.</p><p>"You needn't approach."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>From the wind and sand in the distance, Qu Zhen's voice echoed. The Hengsha Society members, without asking for explanation, immediately retreated to their carriages.</p><p>Two powerful enemies instantly subdued, at her mercy. The woman, still shaken, stared at Qin Sang, suddenly remembering Qin Sang's earlier question, and finally understood.</p><p>“Do you know my master?”</p><p>At that moment, the woman seemed to have just recognized Qin Sang's face.  Her eyes widened, her lips slightly parted in disbelief, and she blurted out:</p><p>“You… you are the Sage Qin!”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the woman's reaction.  She seemed to be Bing Han's disciple and recognized him, but her words were unexpected, causing him to frown.</p><p>Sage? What sage? When did he become a sage, and who made him one?</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's change in expression, the woman, her face full of reverence, said excitedly, “Junior Gu Ya greets the Sage! The Sage once lectured at my master's sect. I was too young then and unfortunately missed the opportunity, a regret I've carried ever since. Later, I went to the Sacred Grounds to pay my respects at the statue.  I never imagined I would have such great fortune to see the Sage in person, and even be saved by the Sage…”</p><p>Statues… Sacred Grounds… What nonsense!</p><p>Qin Sang was completely bewildered, finding it absurd. He waved his hand to stop Gu Ya. “What sage? I don’t know anything about this. Who erected a statue for me, and what is this Sacred Ground?”</p><p>Gu Ya was startled, realizing she had been too excited and hadn’t explained things clearly. After the cataclysm, the Sage hadn't returned, so he probably didn't know what had happened.</p><p>“Years ago, the Sage caused a celestial phenomenon in the Storm Sea, visible across the entire realm. Later, the truth was revealed: the Sage sacrificed himself to lure away a demonic entity, saving countless lives and shattering the prison that had confined the realm.  This allowed the entire realm to ascend into the Greater World, opening a path for future generations. We thought the Sage was…”</p><p>Gu Ya paused,  “To commemorate the Sage’s grace, the Qingyang Temple was consecrated as the Sacred Grounds.  Fairy Liuli and various other powerful factions erected a statue of the Sage there for all eternity.”</p><p>“You said… the Storm Realm ascended into the Greater World?” Qin Sang keenly grasped the most crucial information, his heart jolted. “When?”</p><p>The Talisman Realm had ascended, and now the Storm Realm had joined the Greater World.</p><p>Could this be why the First Sword Servant couldn't sense the Storm Realm anymore?</p><p>But the Talisman Realm was one of the four separate territories established by the Dao Court in ancient times, a realm created by the Dao Court using the power of the Divine Court to separate it from the Greater World.</p><p>What about the Storm Realm?</p><p>What was the Storm Realm's origin?</p><p>Was the Storm Realm's ascension related to the Dao Court's return, or perhaps to the Purple Micro Palace?</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the west. Perhaps the Storm Realm existed solely to contain and hide the Purple Micro Palace, and its recall had broken the Storm Realm's confines. But according to the Ghost Mother and various other clues, before the Purple Micro Palace, the Storm Realm clearly held a great secret; even the First Sword Servant dared not forcefully enter.</p><p>If the Storm Realm was also part of the Greater World, why did its cultivators still face the grey tribulation after ascension? Only cultivators from lesser worlds with incomplete heavens would experience tribulation and comprehend true天道 (Heaven's Way) upon ascension to the Greater World.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if there were any precedents of entire lesser worlds merging into the Greater World.</p><p>This news was completely unexpected, and Qin Sang's mind was racing with questions.</p><p>“I can’t give you the exact time,” Gu Ya replied.</p><p>“It’s said that one day, mist appeared in the storm zone, but no one knows exactly when. The mist first spread throughout the storm zone, then filled the entire area, a blinding white expanse beyond the barrier.</p><p>“Gradually, the invisible barrier that contained the storms seemed unable to withstand the mist's invasion. People were anxious.</p><p>“Eventually, the barrier's power weakened, and the white mist truly crossed over. The mist enveloped the land and the sea, everywhere, the world a hazy expanse. People were terrified, believing the end was near.</p><p>“Then came the fluctuating spiritual energy, powerful spiritual tides roaring high in the sky, as if the heavens were collapsing, the storms were truly breaking through. All living beings were consumed by fear, frantically searching for refuge. Cultivators could only hide in their caves, major sects helpless, sealing their gates to await the end.</p><p>“But as time passed, we found that the end hadn't come, and the spiritual energy became richer during the upheaval. Some broke through long-standing bottlenecks, like a parched world reviving.</p><p>“Finally, some people went outside and discovered that the invisible barrier had disappeared, and the eternal storms had vanished…”</p><p>Gu Ya described the changes during the Storm Realm's ascension, based on her personal experiences.</p><p>According to Gu Ya, the truth was obscured by the mist; no one knew exactly when the Storm Realm merged with the Greater World.</p><p>During their initial arrival in the Greater World, the cultivators from Storm World were bewildered, unsure of what had transpired.  They only knew that the spiritual energy in Storm World had become increasingly abundant, far more conducive to cultivation.  It was much later that they understood the true nature of the events.</p><p>The changes were gradual, without a precise starting point.  The surge of spiritual energy didn't happen instantaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully questioned Gu Ya about her experiences during that period, seeking any evidence to support his own assessment. He had left Storm World, traveling from Central State to the Canglang Sea, even venturing to the edge of the Netherworld.  Earlier, he and Liuli had journeyed from the North Sea to Central State.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't be certain if the "fog" Gu Ya described had begun to coalesce during those times.  Within the Storm Belt, relentless storms perpetually churned the seawater, creating a perpetual mist.  Between the Western Lands and Central State, however, it was perpetually ablaze.</p><p>The transformation of Storm World lasted a long time. The fog was already spreading when he was in the Talisman Realm.  Only after his ascension to the Greater World did Storm World cultivators realize they had become part of it.</p><p>It remains uncertain whether this was related to the Dao Court's return, or perhaps even earlier, to the ascension of the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Ironically, Qin Sang endured countless hardships before ascending to the Greater World, while the people of Storm World were inexplicably "elevated."</p><p>This is deeply disheartening for Venerable Huiguang, Saint King Qinghu, Mo Xingdao, and all those Storm World pioneers who toiled so hard to open the ascension path in the Netherworld;  and for the talented individuals who were tragically cut short before reaching the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Qin Sang had believed he would hardly see any of his old friends from Storm World again, perhaps only one or two at most.  But now, with Storm World's integration into the Greater World, its spiritual energy resurgence, its transformation into a cultivation haven, and the presence of the grey tribulation, countless acquaintances will undoubtedly see a meteoric rise in their cultivation!</p><p>"Where is Storm World now? How did you end up here, being hunted?"</p><p>Qin Sang suspected Storm World might be near the Fengju Jade Gate, raising the possibility of Ziwei Palace's involvement.</p><p>"After our arrival in the Greater World, the fog didn't dissipate.  Whether on land or sea, day or night, a thick fog persisted. Later, we learned we were in a place called the Fog Sea."</p><p>"The Fog Sea was far from peaceful. As we explored, we were discovered by the Changyou, triggering a war."</p><p>"The Changyou are bipedal, like humans, but covered in yellow fur, much thicker than human hair.  They resemble apes but have four ears, and possess an innate water-affinity, thriving in the sea. We were unprepared and suffered heavy losses. My master died in that war."</p><p>Gu Ya's voice fell, her excitement waning.  The integration of Storm World into the Greater World had brought a glimmer of hope to its cultivators, yet her master perished at the very moment that hope arrived – a heartbreaking loss.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. His friendship with Binghan originated from a jade knife. Now, he learns of another loss, and he knows Binghan was certainly not the only one.</p><p>"Later, we discovered that we hadn't entered human territory, but the land of the Heterogeneous People. These beings are all strangely formed, possessing human bodies yet bearing features resembling various demonic beasts. Besides the Changyou, countless Heterogeneous People with unique traits have formed clans and nations across the Fog Sea.  The most powerful are said to be the Feather People and the Merfolk…" Gu Ya suppressed her grief, continuing her tale.</p><p>Fog Sea, Heterogeneous People.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. He had read about the Heterogeneous People – a race distinct from humans, demons, and witches in the Greater World. Legends spoke of a boundless, fog-shrouded sea in the depths of the East Sea, a place of mystery where the Heterogeneous People resided.</p><p>Storm World had fallen into the territory of other races – whether this was fortunate or disastrous remained to be seen.</p><p>"Immortal Liuli and various factions, together with Storm World cultivators, fought back against the Heterogeneous People, but the Fog Sea held more than just these races. There was also the catastrophic Fog Waterfall. I was swept away by it and ended up here."</p><p>Gu Ya recalled the experience, still shaken. After regaining her composure, she continued.</p><p>"The Fog Waterfall struck without warning. It was terrifying. I thought I'd be ripped apart. After a dizzying spin, I lost consciousness. When I awoke, I was severely injured but alive, cast upon an unfamiliar land. After careful investigation, I realized I was far from the Fog Sea, surrounded by dangers, alone, and forced to focus on improving my cultivation.</p><p>"I later learned I'd been thrown into the dark region between the Savage Lands and Great Zhou. By chance, I heard about the Fengju Jade Gate and the reappearance of the Ziwei Palace there.</p><p>"The Ziwei Palace is renowned in the North Star Region. I thought that once news of the Palace spread, cultivators who had ascended from the lower realms might be drawn here…"</p>
