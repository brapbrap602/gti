<h1>Chapter 1637: Reliance</h1><p>Chapter 1637: Reliance</p><p>“It’s your fault!”</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master was furious.</p><p>The Disfigured Man sneered, “Back then, you accepted my payment and hunted with my incompetent disciple.  Two severely injured men escaped. Now they’ve come for revenge; you can hardly claim innocence. Instead of getting worked up, think about how to help me eliminate them and avenge ourselves!”</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master gritted his teeth. “I’m just a remnant soul, with no divine powers or treasures left. What can I do?”</p><p>The Disfigured Man’s tone softened slightly. He promised, “You’ve seen the difficulty of cultivating that secret technique. I need help to increase the chances of success. I’m a lone wolf with many enemies, but I have some connection with you.  Besides you, who else can I cooperate with? After this Imperial Palace matter, as long as you fully assist my cultivation, I promise to help you restore your cultivation and rebuild your physical body. If we find a chance for ascension in Emperor’s Grant Mountain, we’ll share it.”</p><p>“Ascension…”</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master felt bitter. He hated Qin Sang deeply.</p><p>Not long ago, he had ambitions for ascension. Now, he was reduced to this.</p><p>Everything had become a dream.</p><p>Although the Disfigured Man’s words lacked any threat, the Crying Spirit Cave Master knew how ruthless he was.</p><p>His remnant soul was in the other man’s hands.</p><p>He was at the other's mercy.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master had no choice but to trust the Disfigured Man.  Noticing a change in the Disfigured Man’s tone, he exclaimed in surprise, “You want to eliminate them here?”</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master secretly resented him.</p><p>This old scoundrel had the confidence to fight two people alone, clearly hiding his strength, yet he didn't save him!</p><p>“Killing them both simultaneously might be beyond my abilities. Since that person has delivered the spirit wood, I’ll accept it! However, my powers require a specific environment to reach their full potential.  I’ll be greatly restricted in the Ice Instrument Palace,” the Disfigured Man’s eyes flashed with cold light as he explained.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the Crying Spirit Cave Master said, “The attacker used a strange demonic fire, incredibly powerful.  His spiritual sense was the strongest I’ve ever encountered. He used a secret technique targeting the soul, making me disoriented, leading to my defeat…”</p><p>The Disfigured Man hadn’t witnessed the battle within the flag formation. Through the Crying Spirit Cave Master’s description, he learned about some of Qin Sang’s methods.</p><p>“Using demonic fire…”</p><p>The Disfigured Man made a surprised sound, his expression changing slightly.</p><p>“You’ve thought of it too—demonic fire plus sword array…  Unless I’m mistaken, the enemy Su Zinan found is this person! This person obtained the Water Phase Master’s relic; it’s no coincidence that he appeared here and can control the Ice Instrument Palace’s formation. Su Zinan claimed that Old Wu suffered a great loss at his hands. Old Wu has disappeared without a trace, at least he’s severely injured…”</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master’s tone was full of warning. He had barely escaped with his remnant soul and didn’t want any more mishaps.</p><p>The best course of action was to find Su Zinan first and cooperate to take revenge.</p><p>“I just don’t know where Su Zinan is now!”</p><p>The Disfigured Man’s eyes were gloomy. He glanced behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s avatar was in hot pursuit but kept a distance, controlling four serpentine spirit seals, constantly ordering them to attack.</p><p>Earlier,</p><p>The avatar used a spiritual treasure to block the Disfigured Man, and they clashed.</p><p>The Disfigured Man sensed the powerful surge of Nine Nether Demonic Fire erupting from within the flag array, and was startled. He realized that the Crying Spirit Cave Master was likely doomed and began to lose heart.</p><p>Bursting into the flag array to rescue him would be fine if he succeeded, but if he failed, he would likely be entangled by the array and attacked, putting him at a disadvantage.</p><p>Given his nature, would he do something so disadvantageous to himself?</p><p>Even though the Crying Spirit Cave Master was taking the brunt for him.</p><p>But Qin Sang’s avatar was extremely cunning, hiding behind his spiritual treasure, making it impossible to achieve the goal of defeating them one by one in a short time. The Disfigured Man immediately retreated, not in defeat, but to leave the Ice Palace first and then consider how to counterattack.</p><p>After learning the information from the Crying Spirit Cave Master, the confidence in the Disfigured Man’s eyes gradually faded, and his thoughts raced.</p><p>At that moment, thunder roared in the Ice Instrument Palace. A thunderbolt tore through the azure sky, the lightning breaking through the layers of palaces—a lightning escape technique.</p><p>The speed of this escape technique was unparalleled.</p><p>At the same time, the avatar changed its previous entanglement tactic and used its spiritual treasure to attack fiercely.</p><p>The serpent twisted its body, its long tail swept through the air, a terrifying roar as it pounced, leaving a trail of cold flame in the air.</p><p>The man with the grotesque face felt his eyelids twitch. A green light flared behind him. His wooden armor trembled slightly as it replicated the image of a giant tree, its lush crown forming a protective canopy above.</p><p>He quickly looked away, muttering a strange syllable.  He had already escaped the main ice palace and returned to the Qilin screen wall. His gaze swept past the ruins of the screen wall towards the vast forest ahead.</p><p>Instantly, the ancient trees in the lush forest swayed. Clusters of green light floated up from the undergrowth, the aura of wood spirits intensifying to an extreme level.</p><p>The points of light varied in size, some as large as pearls, others no bigger than green peas, yet all exceptionally pure.  Above the forest, the countless green lights coalesced into a sea of green, gently undulating with the swaying trees, creating a bizarrely beautiful sight.</p><p>The green lights flowed, their movement directed at the grotesque-faced man, quickly forming an ethereal path of light leading directly to his feet.</p><p>His speed surged, as if pulled along the light path, traversing the void and rushing into the forest.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A deafening thunderclap echoed.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going, fellow cultivator?”</p><p>With a cold shout, Qin Sang's main body, utilizing both sword and thunder techniques to their limits, broke through the air, catching up to the grotesque-faced man in the forest.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Inside the ice palace, a thunderous roar echoed.</p><p>The azure celestial light seemed to be drawn downwards by a powerful force, hanging lower and lower. From the outside, the ice palace was still enveloped in the azure light.</p><p>Unbeknownst to those outside, the changes beneath the blue light were becoming increasingly violent. After the Ice Lake Formation annihilated the leader of the Weeping Spirit Cave, the formation banners continuously shattered, and the few remaining intact banners couldn't hold for much longer.</p><p>Once all the banners were destroyed, the azure celestial light would begin to disintegrate from within, the spirit formation self-destructing and undoubtedly destroying the entire ice palace.</p><p>Until the ice palace's destruction, the forest would remain unaffected.</p><p>Above the forest.</p><p>Green light rippled.</p><p>Qin Sang and the grotesque-faced man faced each other.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the man's wrist. Sensing an evil spirit's aura, he thought, "So that's the trick."</p><p>When the evil spirits scattered, he had noticed and specifically used the sword array to annihilate them, but the grotesque-faced man was cunning, managing to save one.</p><p>However, the leader of the Weeping Spirit Cave only had a remnant soul left; it couldn’t cause much trouble. Whether it lived or died was of little consequence.</p><p>“Fellow cultivator, we have no grievances between us, why are you so relentless?”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man spoke, attempting a reconciliation.</p><p>The leader of the Weeping Spirit Cave continued to curse.</p><p>Ignoring him, Qin Sang’s main body, using his treasure, pursued, sharply rebuking,  “When we first met in the Southern Frontier, we had no grievances, yet you attacked without hesitation!”</p><p>“Don't you understand the principle of ‘he who possesses a treasure invites calamity’?”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man chuckled darkly.</p><p>His actions showed he had no intention of resolving their conflict; his previous words were merely a delaying tactic.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't waste any more time with him. Eliminating the leader of the Weeping Spirit Cave was half the objective. Today, with his main body and avatar working together, he would deal with the isolated grotesque-faced man – the perfect opportunity to settle their score.</p><p>He silently made a sword gesture.</p><p>The surrounding sword light abruptly stopped. The Golden Sinking Sword flashed, leaving a brilliant arc in the void, striking directly at the grotesque-faced man!</p><p>The grotesque-faced man flicked his wrist, the evil spirit infused with the remnant soul of the leader of the Weeping Spirit Cave being stored in his sleeve. Simultaneously, he pressed his palm downwards, releasing a wooden bead.</p><p>The sword light approached, the razor-sharp sword intent causing the grotesque-faced man's pupils to constrict before radiating a brilliant light.  He casually grabbed at the void, the countless light points bursting into dazzling brilliance. An extremely dense green tide gathered before him, surging forth.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword pierced the green tide, causing a wave to surge.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the invisible resistance transmitted by the Golden Sinking Sword and was about to deploy the sword array.</p><p>Just then, he noticed the wooden bead slipping from the grotesque-faced man's hand, falling into the tree crown, merging with the countless light points, becoming almost invisible.</p><p>From the bead, countless thin spirit threads shot out, each connecting to a point of light, flying outward.</p><p>If the wooden bead connected with all the light points, the entire forest would fall under the grotesque-faced man's control.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn’t let that happen. He raised a finger, unleashing his lightning control technique.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A bolt of heavenly lightning struck without warning.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man's expression changed slightly, but he was prepared. He quickly made a hand gesture, a phantom appearing before him as his wooden armor reformed, blocking the heavenly lightning above.</p><p>The treasure, moments before under attack, was instantly recalled by the strange-faced man.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>Sky thunder struck the wooden armor, causing its spiritual light to flicker wildly.</p><p>Electrical threads scattered, but could only crawl across the surface. Even those bypassing the armor posed no threat to the wooden bead.</p><p>The bead paused slightly, then the spiritual threads resumed their furious advance, quickly connecting more than half the light points.  They resembled a giant net, each point a node, spreading across the forest.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He aimed his sleeve at the ground, releasing demonic fire.  Instead of its usual dragon form, it instantly transformed into countless fire snakes.</p><p>The writhing mass of snakes, horrifying to behold, scattered, pursuing the bead's threads and devouring them.</p><p>The nearly completed spiritual net was rapidly unraveling.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master warned that the demonic fire's power was immense; caution was necessary.</p><p>The strange-faced man, unable to wait, rapidly tapped his right hand, releasing a fist-sized, altar-like spiritual seal. It flashed into the net.</p><p>The wooden bead exploded, but without wood splinters. Pure spiritual light surged through the threads into the light points.</p><p>The forest shook violently. A green disc, amber-like in texture and internally shimmering with starlight, formed around the strange-faced man, a large formation continuously drawing in the forest's wood spirit energy.  Trapped within it would be akin to being imprisoned in a Heavenly Prison.</p><p>Unfortunately, the disc was incomplete. Black lines constantly moved between the light points, staining the green disc black, the darkness rapidly spreading.</p><p>Containing Qin Sang was a futile dream.</p><p>The disc would collapse soon.  Moreover, the Seven Souls Killing Formation was complete, its sword threads cutting into the disc, its power rapidly approaching.</p><p>The strange-faced man continuously changed his hand seals, but couldn't suppress the demonic fire.  He hesitated no longer, brought his hands together sharply, and roared, "Prison Decree!"</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The disc exploded, green light shooting into the sky.</p><p>The countless light points blazed with intense brightness, the threads between them growing thicker, quickly transforming into massive vines that filled the sky.</p><p>Before the word "Decree" fully left his lips,</p><p>The wildly growing vines froze, coated in a grayish-white film, like a faded ink painting.</p><p>Death energy spread.</p><p>The vibrant forest instantly transformed into a death trap—clearly a power far surpassing the Hell's Withering Prison.</p><p>A vortex of death energy appeared beneath Qin Sang's feet, accompanied by a powerful binding force. He immediately activated the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, and the scattered demonic fire returned, coalescing into a fire dragon that plunged into the vortex!</p><p>From above, one could see the fire dragon's body extending into the vortex. The demonic fire didn't resist, but instead sped up.</p><p>Flames poured into the vortex.</p><p>Strange whooshing sounds echoed from within. The bottom of the vortex quickly turned black, its rotation slowing drastically.</p><p>Seizing the moment of stagnation, Qin Sang spread his phoenix wings, flashing out of the vortex.</p><p>Before he could regain his footing, he again spread his wings, his figure flickering twice. He reappeared hundreds of feet away.  Three white beams of poison appeared where he'd vanished, clearly striking empty space.</p><p>Three poison beams flashed.</p><p>Their source: light points floating in the void.</p><p>Upon Qin Sang's arrival, the light points instantly transformed into jade armored insect phantoms, appearing without warning and spewing poison.  The poison was swift, but only hit afterimages.</p><p>The jade armored insect's body rested in the strange-faced man's palm, half-embedded in his flesh, greedily devouring his blood, its jade-white body turning pinkish.</p><p>The strange-faced man's face turned ashen, watching Qin Sang unharmed.</p><p>A stinging pain shot through his hand.  The jade armored insect, no longer harmless, became ferociously aggressive, tearing a bloody hole in his palm.</p><p>Since the insect's maturation, the strange-faced man hadn't felt such a powerful backlash from his pet.</p><p>"Is this your trump card?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was playful.</p><p>The move was indeed insidious. The jade armored insect had merged with the strange-faced man's power, transforming the light points into itself—a surprise attack.  Another person would have been hit, but the change was invisible to the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>This was a battle of two spirit insects, with the Sky Eye Butterfly currently holding the advantage.  With Qin Sang's powerful spiritual sense, he likely could have sensed the fluctuations during the light point transformation if he were attentive.</p><p>However, most people would be distracted by the death energy vortex.</p><p>The strange-faced man didn't answer, but coldly snorted and clenched his fist.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body remained motionless.</p><p>A blinding white light, carrying chilling frost energy, suddenly descended from the heavens like a waterfall of ice, plunging from the sky.</p><p>His other self had finally caught up.</p><p>With four Multi-headed Snake seals above his head, his other self appeared in the sky above the forest.</p><p>Without the snakes, the seals slowly rotated, gathering power.</p><p>His true energy was heavily depleted from using his spiritual treasure for so long, so he now used his Ice Soul Divine Light, equally powerful.</p><p>Behind the divine light, the Snow-Treading Divine Blade cut a path through the snow, slashing towards the strange-faced man!</p>
