<h1>Chapter 2019  The Red Dress</h1><p>Chapter 2020 The Red Dress</p><p>Qin Sang recalled how he and Su Nu first met.  The first time, invited by Yue Xiangu, he brought Su Nu back.  He didn't want to get involved and ignored her subtle actions. Later, they met again at the Qisha Palace. Su Nu gave him the Ghost Seal and asked for his help; it was more of a transaction than a conversation.</p><p>Both meetings were coincidental.  They shared hardship during the Demon Sealing War, but Su Nu had been possessed by an ancient demon and was unconscious.</p><p>That these two people would reunite in the vast world, both having reached such heights, is truly unpredictable.</p><p>"Su Nu…"</p><p>Su Nu called him Brother Qin, so Qin Sang didn't use the formal "Daoist friend," but addressed her by name.</p><p>Pausing, Qin Sang asked, "What impressions did you retain of the Lower Realm?"</p><p>Since Su Nu had brought up the past, Qin Sang took the opportunity to ask about her feelings towards the Lower Realm.</p><p>Before the Demon Sealing War, Su Nu suffered greatly. While the Demon Lord was the mastermind, the three major merchant alliances of Canglang Sea and Yue Xiangu were all accomplices.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't have been surprised if Su Nu harbored resentment towards the Lower Realm.</p><p>"The Lower Realm? Brother Qin means Canglang Sea, right?"</p><p>Su Nu, quick-witted, understood immediately, sighing softly in a low voice.  "To be honest, Brother Qin, until I entered Qisha Palace and learned the truth, my heart was filled with resentment. I secretly vowed that once I escaped and had the power for revenge, I would slaughter the three major merchant alliances. I even believed that everyone in Canglang Sea, in the entire world, owed me, and that only killing could alleviate my pain! Until I met Brother Qin…"</p><p>"Brother Qin didn't treat me as a soul slave.  You destroyed the Ghost Seal and entrusted me to the Four Saints Palace.  The Bao siblings at the Four Saints Palace were also kind to me, healing my injuries and letting me cultivate there. Although I wasn't a disciple, the Four Saints Palace treated everyone equally.  I could obtain caves, pills, and magical treasures like other disciples through hard work… I finally understood what normal cultivator life was like and that the world wasn't entirely dark. My resentment gradually disappeared, and I broke through to the Yuan Ying stage…"</p><p>Su Nu reminisced, her eyes soft.  Even after a thousand years, the memories were vivid, every detail clear.</p><p>Before and after the Demon Sealing War, her circumstances had changed drastically. She emerged from the darkness, where there was no light, into the sunshine, a crucial turning point in her life, impossible to forget.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu's expression, Qin Sang nodded silently. It seemed her resentment had faded, and there were no lingering grievances.</p><p>Therefore, telling her about the ascension to the Storm World, he could perhaps invite her to go to the Mist Sea with him and help. Even if his identity was exposed and he was forced to flee, Su Nu could take Gu Ya back and protect the Storm World.</p><p>However, it was only a recent reunion, so Qin Sang didn't bring it up immediately.  People's hearts are hard to fathom; he needed to observe further.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, Su Nu let out a sigh of relief, pulling herself out of her memories. With some curiosity, she asked, "Before Brother Qin ascended, you must have traveled throughout the Lower Realm.  How many places similar to Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea are there? Where did Brother Qin come from?"</p><p>Back then, she hadn't been able to leave Canglang Sea before being taken to the vast world by the Qisha Palace.</p><p>"To my knowledge, Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea are very close, almost the same sea area. Besides them, there's the North Sea, the almost entirely landmass of the Western Lands, and the largest and strongest Central Plains, located on opposite ends of a vast continent. The ascension path is in the Abyss…"</p><p>Qin Sang briefly described the Storm World.</p><p>Qin Sang had also been curious about whether there were any other large shelters in the Storm World. After asking Gu Ya, he learned that there were indeed only the North Sea, the Central Plains, the Western Lands, Canglang Sea, and the Demon Sea. Did this mean only five Sword Pavilions remained?</p><p>Su Nu was surprised. "The North Sea and Canglang Sea are so far apart! And the Storm Precipice! How did Brother Qin cross it back then? Could it be…"</p><p>"Yes, the Ziwei Palace is located in Beichen, one of the four regions of the North Sea.  The Ziwei Palace and the Qisha Palace are connected," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>"No wonder…"</p><p>Su Nu murmured, relieved. "Brother Qin must have also come after hearing about the emergence of the Ziwei Palace. Thankfully, the Sword Pavilions exist; otherwise, I don't know when I could have thanked Brother Qin in person."</p><p>Qin Sang thought Su Nu was right.  He had arrived not long ago and already received good news. "The Sword Pavilion in the Western Lands has never been discovered, its name unknown. The Central Plains has the Tianxiang and Tian Tong Sword Pavilions, but I haven't been to either.  However, I've entered the Ziwei Palace three times and reviewed some classics in Central Plains sects.  Since you understand Qisha Palace, if we work together to explore the fragments of the Sword Pavilions, we might have unexpected gains.</p><p>"That's exactly what I had in mind!"</p><p>Su Nu smiled charmingly.  "There are several places I couldn't even approach, likely those sword pavilions Qin mentioned.  This time, with you, we'll surely clean them out!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, noncommittal. His true goal wasn't the pavilions' treasures, but if the opportunity presented itself, he wouldn't mind a visit.</p><p>Besides, there was something else…</p><p>Qin Sang channeled a thread of true energy, conjuring an image between them: a mountain peak brimming with mystery.</p><p>Mount Tianshan of the Ziwei Palace!</p><p>Liuli's master, Bing Yao, was trapped there, ascending with the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>He'd promised Liuli he'd find her master. He'd inquired diligently at the Jade Gate Pass and when speaking with Qu Zhen, but had found no trace of Mount Tianshan. News reaching the Jade Gate Pass was never a secret, and Qu Zhen and his peers, limited by their cultivation, dared not venture too deep.  Su Nu, having been in the area of the Jade Gate for many years, certainly knew of more hidden fragments of the sword pavilions.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's serious expression, Su Nu studied the image for a long time before gently shaking her head. "I've never seen such a mountain! However, the sword pavilion fragments were ravaged by void storms during the ascension. They're all disfigured, many shattered or collapsed celestial mountains. I'll take you to look, maybe we can find it."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his true energy, musing that if Mount Tianshan was the core of the Ziwei Palace, it might still be sealed, and Bing Yao might not have escaped.</p><p>Then Qin Sang remembered Qu Zhen. "My trip isn't solely for the fragments. I hired some helpers, one of whom is waiting outside. I'll let him act independently."</p><p>Qin Sang dashed out, found Qu Zhen, led him to a safe place, and instructed him to rendezvous with the others.</p><p>Su Nu secretly followed. After Qu Zhen left, she reappeared. "Qin, I've selected a few fragments. Shall we start there?"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>They set off immediately.  Su Nu possessed initial Perfected Void cultivation, needing no assistance from Qin Sang. They moved quickly, delving deeper. After some twists and turns, they reached the first fragment.</p><p>The fragment floated silently in the void, emitting a faint white light in the darkness, quite conspicuous.  It was strangely quiet, seemingly deserted. This was a region where even Metamorphosis cultivators dared not tread; any visitor would be a Perfected Void expert or higher.</p><p>Even Qin Sang and Su Nu, working together, dared not be careless. After cautious observation, they cautiously approached.</p><p>In the center of the fragment lay a collapsed mountain peak, now a pile of rubble. The surroundings were in disarray, but a subtle, powerful formation could still be sensed.</p><p>"Have you been here before, Qin?" Su Nu asked expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, then slowly shook his head. It wasn't any place he recognized, impossible to determine if it was from the Ziwei Palace or another pavilion.</p><p>This was normal. His three visits to the Ziwei Palace were superficial, and even the powerful Eight Scenery and Ganlu Monastery had only explored a small portion of the Tian Tong and Tian Xiang Halls.</p><p>They didn't linger, moving on to the next fragment, several more proving unrelated to Mount Tianshan.</p><p>Their search wasn't solely for Mount Tianshan; they also sought suitable fragments to explore.</p><p>Some fragments were conspicuous, visited by many, offering little chance of discovery. Others were rarely visited, implying significant danger, requiring careful consideration. They planned to survey all of them before acting.</p><p>As the two long-separated acquaintances journeyed together, the strangeness between them gradually faded, making their shared past all the more precious.</p><p>"The last fragment resembled a place mentioned in the Eight Scenery records.  Perhaps we should revisit it…"</p><p>As Qin Sang and Su Nu discussed the previous fragment, they reached the next one.  The sight within caused his gaze to sharpen, his expression transforming instantly.</p><p>Su Nu, seeing Qin Sang's expression, looked ahead in astonishment.  Was this the place Qin was seeking?</p><p>Before them lay a land almost reduced to ruins.  At the edge stood a broken mountain, once undoubtedly majestic, now only a fragmented base remained, the mountain itself vanished, as if erased by a powerful force.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang landed before the broken mountain.</p><p>He remembered Liuli holding off Dongyang Bo, giving him an escape route.  His solitary descent remained a vivid, terrifying memory.  Though drastically changed, he recognized it instantly.</p><p>This was Mount Tianshan!</p><p>The remains of Mount Tianshan!  The Bei Chen cultivators considered Mount Tianshan an enigmatic, crucial place within the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Who would have thought that the Tianshan Mountains were merely an outer region of the Purple Micro Palace!</p><p>The Tianshan Mountains, separated from the Purple Micro Palace, weren't merely damaged; they were virtually leveled.</p><p>Those within the mountains…</p><p>Qin Sang stared blankly at the shattered mountains, a stubborn, pretty face flashing through her mind.  Speechless, she felt Su Nu appear beside her.  Su Nu asked gravely, “If anyone was in the mountains, would it have been possible for them to survive the ascension?”</p><p>Su Nu dispersed her spiritual sense, carefully scanning the destroyed mountains. Her tone was heavy.  “The mountains are in this state because those attempting ascension had almost no defense against the void currents.”</p><p>The meaning was clear.</p><p>As a witness, Su Nu knew better than anyone how terrifying the situation had been.</p><p>Bing Yao, trapped in the Tianshan Mountains, lacked an ascension platform, and had no Demon Lord to share the burden. With the mountains obliterated, she had virtually no chance of survival!</p><p>Su Nu hesitated, then asked, “That person… was she a friend of Brother Qin?”</p><p>“An old acquaintance.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, finally knowing where Liuli was. But this reunion ‘gift’ was unbearably cruel.  Her master was Liuli’s spiritual pillar, having waited a thousand years and searched tirelessly her whole life. To rescue her master, she was willing to sacrifice everything, even her own life, only to receive such a devastating outcome.</p><p>“Brother Qin, please accept my condolences,” Su Nu softly consoled, standing silently beside him.</p><p>After a long while, the figure before the shattered mountains disappeared, leaving only a faint sigh, gradually dispersed by the wind.</p><p>…</p><p>“Brother Qin, this is a map I drew myself. These marked locations are relatively safe, serving as temporary resting places. I will be in seclusion here…”</p><p>Su Nu materialized a map, pointing to a light spot. “After dealing with those people, rendezvous here.”</p><p>The two wandered through Fengju Jade Gate, passing numerous fragments of sword pavilions, until Qin Sang reached the agreed-upon time with Young Master Xin.  They had agreed to meet periodically to exchange their findings, so Qin Sang took his leave of Su Nu.</p><p>The map's value was self-evident.  Su Nu even revealed her usual seclusion location.  Just as Qin Sang was about to thank her, Su Nu, seemingly anticipating this, smiled slightly.  “Brother Qin, must we be so formal with each other?”</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, said no more, bowed slightly, and vanished in a flash of light.</p><p>Watching the departing light, the smile faded from Su Nu's face. Her brows furrowed slightly, a hint of puzzlement in her eyes.</p><p>After a long gaze, she sighed softly, turned, and vanished. But she didn’t go to the location marked on the map. Instead, she arrived at a small world surrounded by layers of illusionary barriers.</p><p>The sight within the small world was shocking, a breathtaking spectacle.</p><p>Towering stone stelae stood across the land, forming an endless forest, a colossal stelae array beyond imagination.</p><p>Su Nu’s figure flickered, arriving at the center of the array. There, a stone platform was inscribed with countless runes.</p><p>Kneeling on the platform, Su Nu unfastened the beaded bracelet on her left wrist and tossed it upward. The beads scattered, and one jade bead slowly ascended, emitting a bright light like a moon hanging in the sky, radiating strange energy—clearly a magical artifact.</p><p>Then, Su Nu performed a spell, her face suddenly turning pale.  Her lifeblood flowed out, dripping onto the platform, following the runes and staining the entire platform red. The blood light continued to spread outwards.</p><p>A startling scene unfolded.  Each stone stelae quickly became covered in fine threads of blood, until the entire array was enveloped. The earth trembled violently, and the blood light soared into the sky.</p><p>The jade bead seemed surrounded by a sea of blood, its light growing brighter, undergoing strange transformations.</p><p>Su Nu’s lips were bloodless, her breath weak, yet she exerted every ounce of strength to perform the spell.</p><p>Finally, the jade bead transformed into a round mirror. The surface was initially chaotic, but gradually became clear, revealing a blurry image, seemingly transmitted from a distant, unknown place.</p><p>In the mirror, a cold throne stood, and upon it sat a monarch.</p><p>Though the image was extremely blurry, making facial features unclear, one thing was certain: this monarch was an unparalleled beauty.</p><p>Most striking was her crimson dress.</p><p>Her posture was slightly languid, the red dress fiery yet not at all jarring, exuding the majesty of a phoenix, the supreme authority of a monarch.</p><p>Su Nu’s expression was solemn, a trace of reverence in her eyes. She bowed her head slightly. “My Empress, I await him…”</p><p>Before she finished, the mirror shattered.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The stelae forest collapsed, destroyed along with the jade bead.</p><p>The loss of a massive stelae array, a precious jade bead, and the lifeblood of a Nascent Soul cultivator, seemed only to convey that one sentence.</p><p>Su Nu herself was extremely weak, collapsing into the pool of blood, unconscious.</p><p></p>
