<h1>Chapter 1903: Cave Abode</h1><p>Fan Rugui, carrying the formula and herbs, left in a hurry.</p><p>This grand hall is the cave abode arranged for him by Cloudtop Mountain; he wouldn't be charged any spirit stones until he refined the Bright Flower Pill.</p><p>There were also maidservants outside the hall, at his beck and call.</p><p>Shortly after Fan Rugui left, Qin Sang also departed from the grand hall.  Dismissing his attendants, he strolled through the city alone.</p><p>Cloud Peak City thrived in the art of alchemy, which spurred a lively trade within its walls.  Many cultivators, having obtained treasures, came to Cloud Peak City to sell them, regardless of the distance.  Therefore, the city not only housed places to trade pills but also a variety of shops, stores, and auction houses, all neatly categorized and organized.  Among them was a place specializing in the sale of cave abodes, called the Blessed Land Pavilion.</p><p>Learning of such a place, Qin Sang's interest was piqued, and he set off towards the Blessed Land Pavilion.  The Bright Flower Pill was taken care of; now it was time to find a cave abode for himself.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had a general understanding of the Cloud Capital Mountain cultivation world. As he interacted with more local cultivators, he found there was no trace of other ascended beings.  If this place was the exit of the Wicked River, a place of ascension, there should be some clues.</p><p>Qin Sang surmised that the Wicked River ferryman sent people into the Great Thousand randomly, without any specific location.  Waiting here for Liuli and the others to ascend and reunite was impossible.</p><p>However, Qin Sang did not intend to leave.  He had just entered the Great Thousand, and his friends who had ‘ascended’ before were nowhere to be found.  He also had no leads on the Sword Pavilion or the hilt of the Earth-Slaying Sword.</p><p>The Great Thousand world was filled with powerful cultivators.  He decided to wait until he had firmly established himself in the Nascent Soul stage and could contend with other Nascent Soul cultivators before considering traveling.  Until then, it made no difference where he cultivated.</p><p>The First Sword Attendant hadn't set any time limits, for example, requiring him to do something specific or achieve a certain accomplishment within a certain number of years.  The battles between Mahayana-level cultivators were too far removed from his current reality. Qin Sang decided not to be influenced by these karmic entanglements and to continue living according to his own habits and ideas.</p><p>Having decided to stay in Cloud Capital Mountain, he had to consider the Cloud Capital Sect's perspective.  As the saying goes: How can one tolerate another sleeping beside one's bed?  If Cloud Capital Sect discovered a Nascent Soul cultivator hidden nearby, they would surely be uneasy and investigate Qin Sang's intentions.</p><p>If the Cloud Capital Sect had a Unity Stage ancestor, Qin Sang wouldn't want a Unity Stage cultivator visiting him.  Even if their ancestor was only at the Nascent Soul stage, there would be repeated probing and calculations, preventing him from cultivating peacefully.</p><p>Qin Sang had also considered openly visiting the Cloud Capital Sect to obtain the position of guest elder; it should not be difficult.  But he knew that no matter where he went, there would always be entanglements of interest.</p><p>The Cloud Capital Sect could dominate Cloud Capital Mountain, but beyond Cloud Capital Mountain, there were surely larger realms and powers that could rival, or even subdue, the Cloud Capital Sect. Once drawn into this large web, he would inevitably be caught up in things beyond his control.  Getting entangled in a whirlpool of karma was not something he could easily escape.</p><p>For now, he was merely staying here temporarily, seeking nothing from the Cloud Capital Sect, so there was no need to worry about it.</p><p>“It’s best to stay far away from the Cloud Capital Sect, or even leave Cloud Capital Mountain…”</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, he had arrived before the Blessed Land Pavilion.  A grand archway with three gilded characters, 'Blessed Land Pavilion', met his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, gazing at the golden characters. Since entering the Great Thousand world, he had noticed that the language and script here were different from those of the Talisman Realm and the Storm Realm, but showed a common ancestry.  Was the Talisman Realm a world sealed off by the Heavenly Court from the Great Thousand? And where did the Storm Realm obtain its heritage?</p><p>It wasn’t possible that every Lesser Thousand world could spontaneously develop a script identical to the Great Thousand’s!</p><p>Behind the archway stood several cloud-like pavilions, exquisitely crafted.  Qin Sang chose the outermost pavilion and entered.  Immediately, a pretty maid greeted him.</p><p>Qin Sang stated his intentions, and the maid’s smile brightened, as she gracefully led Qin Sang into another, noticeably more luxurious pavilion, where he met an elder in green robes.</p><p>“Manager Lu, this Qingfeng Immortal wishes to purchase a Nascent Soul-level cave abode,” the maid bowed.</p><p>The Blessed Land Pavilion categorized cave abodes according to the cultivation level of the cultivator, making it straightforward.</p><p>Manager Lu also welcomed him with a smile.  “Immortal Qingfeng wishes to purchase a cave abode?  You've come to the right place!  With the trust of many cultivators of Cloud Capital Mountain, our pavilion not only possesses its own cave abodes but also those entrusted to us by others.  Years of accumulation have resulted in an uncountable number of abodes, allowing us to meet any cultivator's needs! You simply can't find such a complete selection anywhere else!”</p><p>It sounded no different from a real estate agency in the mortal world.</p><p>“Manager Lu, your words are quite bold, but I prefer to see for myself,” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Manager Lu wasn't annoyed, smiling as he produced a golden register.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the golden register, secretly praising the renowned Fortune Land Pavilion.  The jade slips contained not only detailed information about the caves, but also clear images viewable with spiritual sense, making everything readily apparent.</p><p>Most of these caves were located in the Yun Du Mountains, though some lacked precise addresses, only indicating general locations.</p><p>Qin Sang examined each entry without changing expression.</p><p>Manager Lu observed his demeanor and said, "Friend, there's no need for worry. These caves are absolutely safe.  During the transaction, you can ask a city official to witness it. Even if you don't trust us, you should trust the City Lord's authority in the Yun Du Mountains.  Besides, the Yun Du Heavens oversee everything. What reckless individual would dare cause trouble there?"</p><p>"Are there any better caves than these?" Qin Sang closed the register and asked.</p><p>"That…" Manager Lu hesitated.  "I believe you can afford a higher price, Friend, but the better caves involve more complexities; they can't be treated as simple transactions... Of course, if your background is substantial enough, these issues can be overlooked."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could reply, Manager Lu added, "The Pavilion also has caves with undetermined classifications, but these test the buyer's discernment."</p><p>"You mean the caves deep within the Yun Du Mountains, right? Are things equally strict outside the Yun Du Mountains?" Qin Sang questioned.</p><p>Manager Lu was startled. "There are indeed commissions from cultivators outside the Yun Du Mountains, but the Pavilion cannot verify their authenticity, and Yun Ding City has limited reach. The Pavilion only acts as an intermediary; we are not involved in anything else. Friend, please consider this carefully."</p><p>Saying this, Manager Lu produced another golden register.</p><p>Its contents were exactly as he described.</p><p>This one also contained what Qin Sang sought—caves in the western wilderness mountains, which the Fortune Land Pavilion called the Sunset Mountain Region.</p><p>Each description was embellished, portraying them as top-tier cultivation sites. But cultivators aren't fools; many entries, some centuries or millennia old, remained untouched.</p><p>How much was true, and how much was a fishing expedition?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about his safety, but he didn't want a wasted trip. Even if he turned the tables, he wouldn't gain anything worthwhile; it would be pointless.</p><p>The seemingly reliable ones didn't meet his requirements.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to personally visit several of the unclassified caves, each having reasons for their indeterminate status.</p><p>These caves harbored secrets, some dangerous, their previous owners lacking the strength to explore them fully.</p><p>They were a mixture of truth and falsehood, relying entirely on one's judgment.</p><p>With Qin Sang's experience, discovering interesting information was not difficult.</p><p>At that moment, Manager Lu's expression shifted slightly, remembering something.</p><p>"Friend Qingfeng, if you are seeking this type of cave, there happens to be one recently listed, and its owner is currently in the city."</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang looked up.  "Tell me about it."</p><p>"This is rather unusual.  The owner is only at the Qi Condensation stage but claims to have information about a cave, at least of the Nascent Soul level! He demands various treasures in exchange but won't reveal specifics unless he sees the goods first. Fortunately, this is in Yun Ding City; otherwise, he would have been exploited long ago... If you're interested, I'll summon him."</p><p>Manager Lu shook his head as he spoke, clearly skeptical.</p><p>"Qi Condensation? Then it must be an ancestral legacy. Since I have nothing else to do, please invite this person," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Manager Lu readily agreed, apologized, and went to give instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in the quiet room, reviewing the register.</p><p>After a quarter of an hour.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed two auras approaching the room—one was Manager Lu, the other was a Qi Condensation cultivator with a rapid, anxious breath.</p><p>Soon, a knock echoed, and Manager Lu brought a young man inside before quietly withdrawing.</p><p>Qin Sang put down the register and examined the youth.</p><p>He appeared sixteen or seventeen, with delicate features and worry etched between his brows, exuding a gloomy aura.</p><p>The youth didn't dare sit, his hands clenched tightly in his sleeves as he stood nervously.</p><p>"Y-yes, senior, you wish to buy my cave?"</p><p>The youth was so eager, he forgot to bow or introduce himself.</p><p>"We must first see if your cave meets my requirements, and what you want in return, and if it's worth the price," Qin Sang said calmly, gesturing to the seat opposite him. "Sit and speak."</p><p>The youth shook his head, urgently saying, "Senior, rest assured, I haven't exaggerated in the least! That cave is at least Nascent Soul level!"</p><p>"Have you seen it yourself?" Qin Sang countered.</p><p>The youth froze, stammering, "Junior... junior hasn't seen it, but I wouldn't dare deceive you..."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "You're a mere Qi Condensation cultivator. How can you be so certain without having seen it?"</p><p>"My father told me. He was a late Gold Core cultivator before his death, and he wouldn't lie to me! He discovered a spirit vein suitable for cave creation, but there were dangers nearby. He went home to prepare, but then... an accident happened..."</p><p>At this, the youth's expression darkened, a flash of hatred in his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the shift in the boy's demeanor.  Instead of pressing further, she asked, "I hear you possess a relic?"</p><p>The boy's eyes narrowed, wary.  "Only if you meet my conditions will I give it to you. My father said it will lead us to the cave dwelling."</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, the boy cautiously revealed some information about the spirit vein.</p><p>"So it's there," Qin Sang murmured, a thought sparking in her mind.</p><p>The spirit vein lay between Yun Du Mountain and Mu Luo Mountain range, to the north of Yan Shui Temple.  North of Chen Kingdom, after passing through several human settlements, the land grew increasingly barren.  Unlike the chaotic Mu Luo range, it was a place even cultivators avoided.  Legends spoke of rampant underground fire veins, volatile and prone to eruption, with chaotic spiritual energy and unbearable heat.  A stark contrast to the sacred Yun Du Mountain.  Like the human settlements nearby, suitable cultivation spots were scarce and already occupied.</p><p>According to the boy, this spirit vein was not only rich in spiritual energy, but the surrounding fire veins were unusually calm, making it a rare treasure.  However, powerful fire spirits roamed the area.</p><p>Could this environment help the Vermillion Bird 'grow'?  Qin Sang had considered this possibility. She mused, "Tell me, what do you want?"</p><p>A late-stage Golden Core cultivator's judgment could be trusted.  Moreover, he could sense the abundant spiritual energy from a distance, suggesting something more was afoot.</p><p>"A Purple Origin Pill, a Wan Li Stone, and a top-tier Water-attribute magic treasure!" the boy blurted out, his grip tightening.</p><p>Previously, Manager Lu had scoffed at his demands, and unsurprisingly, no one else showed interest.  A desirable cave dwelling, but at such a great cost, and requiring the removal of fire spirits, even a Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't take such a deal.</p><p>"What is a Purple Origin Pill?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The boy was stunned, his gaze revealing surprise.  Not knowing what a Purple Origin Pill was?  Was this person truly the powerful cultivator Manager Lu had described?</p><p>"It helps Golden Core cultivators break through to Nascent Soul," the boy explained, bewildered.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. "You dare covet Nascent Soul already?  You still have the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages to overcome. Aren't you aiming too high?"</p><p>She recalled her own excitement when she learned about the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid and its use in Nascent Soul pill refinement.  The boy's ambition exceeded even hers.</p><p>"I have the confidence to overcome these stages. I will become a Nascent Soul cultivator!" the boy declared firmly, his eyes filled with a deeper resentment.</p><p>Without knowing the full story, Qin Sang could guess the situation.  She took out a token given to her by Fan Ru Gui and infused it with spiritual energy.</p><p>Shortly after, the guard captain who had escorted her into the city swiftly arrived at the secluded courtyard, ignoring the boy and bowing before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed him a pouch of spirit stones. "Is this enough to exchange for a Purple Origin Pill?"</p><p>Hope surged through the boy; his face flushed with excitement.</p><p>The guard captain glanced at the boy.  "Reporting to Daoist, it is sufficient. I will retrieve the pill at once."  He then hurried away.</p><p>"With the Yun Ding City guard and Manager Lu as witnesses, you can believe me now," Qin Sang said, turning to the boy.</p><p>Manager Lu stood at the entrance of the room, sharply stating, "Boy, be content with what you have. You won't have such good luck again. Let me remind you, don't try any tricks. Otherwise, even if you escape Yun Ding City, I will find you, regardless of whether Daoist takes action or not!"</p><p>The boy shuddered. Given his cultivation level, being able to stand his ground against Manager Lu and Qin Sang until now was already remarkable.</p><p>"Please wait, Senior. I will retrieve the relic."</p><p>Rushing out of the courtyard, the boy took a deep breath, pumped his fists, and ran towards a certain location within the city.</p><p>The guard captain soon returned, followed by the boy, who quickly entered the room and handed the relic to Qin Sang.</p><p>It was a square stone, fiery red like jade.  Qin Sang held it, sensing its essence, a thought stirring within her.</p>
