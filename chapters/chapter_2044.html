<h1>Chapter 2035: The Jade Handle</h1><p>Countless irregularly shaped rocks of varying sizes floated in the void.  </p><p>The expanse of stones stretched as far as the eye could see, possibly covering tens of thousands of miles.  According to Young Master Xin, this place contained only stones; no spiritual illusions or fragments of smaller worlds existed. An unseen force seemed to hold the stones together.</p><p>These seemingly ordinary stones had withstood countless assaults of wicked winds and strange lightning, yet remained.</p><p>However, the illogical sights within the Fengju Jade Gate were commonplace; the group was long inured to them.</p><p>Entering the stone field, the view was monotonous: grey stones stretching as far as the eye could see, like a vast labyrinth.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>A chilling wind howled incessantly through the stones, less dangerous than the wicked winds, but still a considerable nuisance. Qin Sang and Young Master Xin navigated the rocks, the difficulty of finding a hidden realm in such a place self-evident.</p><p>While searching for the realm, Young Master Xin had gathered information.  This place had been noted long ago and searched countless times, but was considered barren, devoid of treasures, and thus neglected.</p><p>Following his family's patriarch's dying wish, Young Master Xin secretly investigated and located the realm.  However, he had kept it hidden to set a trap for Protector Pei and Wandering Cultivator Zhong Liang.</p><p>The stones’ surfaces varied, but their composition was uniform, indicating a common origin.  Young Master Xin speculated they were fragments of a single, colossal rock.</p><p>If so, how immense must the original stone have been?  Throughout their journey, they had encountered countless stones larger than mountain ranges.</p><p>After a winding path, the wind carried a dampness.  A large, flat stone resembling a landmass appeared ahead, bisected by a river, a jade belt across the stony land.</p><p>The river flowed powerfully, its banks lined with desolate stone mountains.</p><p>The group ascended the river; the realm lay at its source.</p><p>Young Master Xin led the way, and they soon reached a vast marsh.</p><p>The air was thick with moisture, shrouded in mist. Despite the absence of any living creatures, the Xin family cultivators spread out cautiously.</p><p>“Elder Qin, the realm’s entrance is underwater,”</p><p>Young Master Xin pointed below.</p><p>Qin Sang extended her spiritual sense, discovering the water was only a few dozen feet deep, the bottom covered with sand and rocks. Beneath them lay a narrow gully from which water flowed, showing no unusual signs.</p><p>This was normal. If the realm’s entrance were easily discovered, it would have already been claimed.</p><p>Young Master Xin produced a silk scarf and gently tossed it into the water.  The water boiled, emitting thick vapor, quickly obscuring the area in a white haze.</p><p>As it sank, the scarf’s color faded, becoming transparent until it blended seamlessly with the water.</p><p>Then, a faint silver gleam appeared within the gully.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. She surveyed her surroundings. They remained stationary; the mist showed no ripples, yet Qin Sang sensed an unknown change nearby.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A violent wind suddenly erupted, churning the white mist into indescribable shapes.</p><p>The others sensed the anomaly and grew wary.</p><p>The wind intensified, its roar deafening, surpassing thunder, like the earth splitting and the sky collapsing.</p><p>Young Master Xin remained calm, standing beside Qin Sang, awaiting orders.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a moment, signaling the Xin family cultivators to proceed, then took a single step forward. That step felt like entering a new world. The wind grew more violent, white mist engulfing the space, the shifting smoke creating a dreamlike scene, marred only by the terrifying wind.</p><p>The chaotic wind caused unease among the group.</p><p>“Is this it?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded, scanning the area, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>“It seems this realm is on the verge of collapse,” Qin Sang stated.</p><p>This fluctuation was familiar; they had experienced it in the tomb – a sign of impending destruction.</p><p>This was even worse than the tomb; the realm was inherently unstable, and their actions had accelerated the collapse.</p><p>“Elder Qin, look,” Young Master Xin pointed towards the depths of the swirling mist, where a long white shape was faintly visible.</p><p>The shape was cylindrical, floating in the wind, rising and falling.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, drawing the shape towards her. It was a jade pillar, nearly seven feet long and requiring three people to embrace.</p><p>The jade pillars showed several cracks, and none were whole; one end of each had a clear break.</p><p>The jade's quality was clear, its interior like flowing water.</p><p>Seeing the pillar, Young Master Xin breathed a sigh of relief, saying, "The pillars must support this realm.  If they're destroyed, the realm loses its support. There must be more than one here!"</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, sensing carefully.  Indeed, he detected a special energy signature – artificially crafted.</p><p>This was a unique method of crafting, piquing Qin Sang's interest. However, a single broken pillar wasn't enough to understand the whole picture.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang ordered everyone to proceed deeper into the misty area. Soon, they found another damaged pillar, this one even more severely broken.</p><p>After a considerable time without incident, Qin Sang commanded, "Separate and find all the pillars; bring them back."</p><p>Then, he sat cross-legged in mid-air, placing one hand on a pillar and closing his eyes to sense its energy, Young Master Xin standing nearby.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Everyone followed orders.</p><p>Subsequently, more pillar fragments were brought back, unfortunately, none whole.</p><p>Then, someone rushed in, reporting, "Young Master! Elder Qin!  There's a complete pillar ahead, but it's immovable!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately rose and followed the person to the pillar.</p><p>The pillar stood in the void, unattached to the sky or ground, yet exceptionally stable, like a divine needle, almost perfectly intact.</p><p>Qin Sang approached, gently touching the pillar, his eyes flashing.  With this pillar and the previous fragments, he could deduce much.</p><p>"The wind... it seems stronger,"</p><p>someone whispered, worry etched on their face.  This meant the realm was collapsing faster; they had little time and needed a solution urgently.</p><p>Young Master Xin was about to speak when a shout came from afar.  A young man in gray robes, having discovered something, rushed towards them.</p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p>"Old Thirteen, you've reached the Divine Transformation stage, yet you're still so impetuous! What happened?" Young Master Xin frowned slightly.</p><p>Reprimanded in front of everyone, the young man looked embarrassed. Glancing at Qin Sang, he said, "Reporting to the Young Master, we found an unusual place, but we're uncertain. The Grand Elder is guarding it, and we dared not act rashly, so I was sent to ask for the Young Master's presence."</p><p>Young Master Xin hummed, her expression calm, as if she already knew.  Without hurrying, she respectfully asked Qin Sang, "Elder Qin, is there any chance of repairing these pillars?"</p><p>"They can be repaired, and it doesn't require a master refiner. Your summoning me was a bit excessive," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"It's a serious matter; I dare not be careless.  If we repair these pillars, can we stop the realm's collapse?" Young Master Xin asked hopefully.</p><p>"Yes, but only temporarily.  The number of pillars is clearly incomplete. To completely stabilize the realm, new pillars must be crafted and added."</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "The materials needed to craft these pillars... you can't gather them now, can you?"</p><p>Young Master Xin sighed, "Opening the realm revealed its full extent.  I made various preparations, but not everything could be foreseen.  Would you have the time, Elder Qin, to wait until we gather the materials...?"</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, interrupting her, "As I said, knowing the method, crafting these pillars isn't difficult. Repair and support these pillars; the realm will certainly hold for some time. I've grasped the complete crafting method; I'll give it to you, and you can have others craft them later."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't promised to have the Xin family rely on him.</p><p>Even if he did, it would be the Xin family working for him, not the other way around, with him personally attending to everything.</p><p>Young Master Xin replied, "As you command!"</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to start refining. He was also curious about the treasures within the realm and ordered the young man in gray robes to lead the way.</p><p>Soon, they reached the location, and the Grand Elder guarding it immediately greeted them, seemingly having discovered something precious, his tone brimming with delight.</p><p>"Young Master, this place may contain Celestial Frost Rune Silver!"</p><p>Dense fog still filled the area, but a patch of silver mist stood out, different from the rest. The silver mist was dense and unchanging, with a 'whooshing' sound emanating from within, like a spring flowing.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed as he examined the silver mist.  It was unlike anything he'd ever seen; he'd never even heard of Celestial Frost Rune Silver.</p><p>Celestial Frost Rune Silver – it sounded like a material, but the Five Elements Alliance's records didn't mention it.</p><p>"Old Thirteen," Young Master Xin called the gray-robed youth forward, whispering instructions.</p><p>The young man murmured incantations, forming a hand seal.  A shimmer of light undulated around him; he stepped to his left, leaving behind a translucent shadow, shaped like a gray wolf.</p><p>The wolf twisted its neck, leaping into the silver mist, tilting its head with a silent howl. Its body soon became coated in a layer of silver mist.</p><p>Then, silver mist continuously seeped into the grey wolf, quickly absorbed for the most part, revealing the interior.  There was a pool of quicksilver within.</p><p>When the grey wolf emerged again, it had transformed into a silver wolf, vigorous, its body solid, its breath deep – a clear qualitative change.</p><p>The Xin family rejoiced at this sight.</p><p>“It truly is Celestial Frost Silver!”</p><p>The Xin clan's young master also showed delight.  Noticing Qin Sang’s gaze, he quickly explained.</p><p>“With all due respect, Elder Qin, Celestial Frost Silver isn’t a naturally occurring spiritual silver. It’s artificially refined.</p><p>“Our Xin family’s Shadow Transformation technique, combined with certain special treasures, allows for further transformation and greatly increased power, but only a few materials meet the requirements, including Celestial Frost Silver.</p><p>“Celestial Frost Silver is the most suitable. Its refining method has long been lost. My father, by chance, discovered that this place might contain Celestial Frost Silver and that it could regenerate continuously…”</p><p>The ceaseless supply of Celestial Frost Silver was indeed a treasure trove for the Xin family; they had to protect this place at all costs.</p><p>So it was artificially created. No wonder I’d never heard of it before.</p><p>Qin Sang scooped up a drop of Celestial Frost Silver, carefully sensing it, and couldn’t help but murmur at its exquisite nature.</p><p>Unable to immediately discern its use, but acting as any refiner would, Qin Sang collected a box of Celestial Frost Silver for later study. The Xin family naturally had no objections.</p><p>The most important thing in the entire realm was this pool of Celestial Frost Silver.</p><p>What followed was simple. Qin Sang found a place and began repairing the jade pillar.</p><p>The Xin young master summoned Xin family cultivators to queue up and refine the Celestial Frost Silver to enhance their powers.  These were all Xin family elites, core members. After this, the Xin family’s overall strength would undoubtedly rise to a new level, perhaps even surpassing that of their previous patriarch's time, excluding Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>When the first jade pillar was completed and erected, the realm’s collapsing trend indeed eased.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang and the Xin family worked together, four streaks of light were speeding through the Fengju Jade Gate, searching for something.</p><p>The people within the light were clearly Buddhist disciples: one monk and three nuns.</p><p>The monk had nine戒疤  on his head, wore a gold-threaded kasaya, held a string of Buddhist beads, and was surrounded by golden light, like a halo – a highly accomplished monk.</p><p>The three nuns all wore sea-blue robes and nun’s hats. One elderly nun continued to silently chant sutras even while flying. Her aura indicated a cultivation level equal to the monk’s.</p><p>The other two nuns followed the elder. One younger nun’s natural beauty was barely concealed by her simple robes, her uncovered hair suggesting she hadn’t yet fully shaved her head.</p><p>Soon, they reached a fragment of a sword pavilion, the very piece of Ziwei Palace where Tianshan Mountain once stood.</p><p>Seeing the almost entirely destroyed Tianshan, the young nun’s face showed sudden panic.  She darted forward and landed before the mountain.</p><p>The ruins spoke of a terrible event that once occurred.</p><p>If anyone had been on the mountain then, they would have undoubtedly been pulverized along with it.</p><p>At that moment, all hope vanished like a dream.</p><p>The young nun trembled and closed her eyes in pain.</p><p>She had searched for a thousand years, only to find this cruel truth.</p><p>The three exchanged glances and slowly approached.</p><p>Seeing the young nun’s expression, they knew without asking that this was their destination.  They examined the mountain, searching for any positive signs. Finally, the monk and the elder nun exchanged a helpless sigh.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>The monk chanted the Buddha’s name.</p><p>The elder nun sighed, her eyes filled with compassion. “Junior Sister, please grieve not.”</p><p>‘Plop!’</p><p>A tear fell to the ground.</p><p>The elder nun opened her mouth to offer further comfort when a violent tremor suddenly shook the void.</p><p>The change was too sudden.  Except for the young nun, lost in her grief, all three were startled.</p><p>“Is it an evil wind and thunder about to erupt?” another nun asked.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>The monk’s expression was grave. He stared intently towards the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>The next moment, a bolt of lightning, as if traversing thousands of miles, tore through the Fengju Jade Gate, followed by a profound aura that enveloped the entire ancient battlefield!</p>
