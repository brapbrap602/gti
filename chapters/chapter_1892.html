<h1>Chapter 1883: The Celestial Starry Array</h1><p>The grand hall seemed bottomless, the spiritual energy flowing in ceaselessly.</p><p>Inside the hall, Zhang Zhenjun was surrounded by a spiritual tide, his body absorbing the endless influx of spiritual energy, his aura rapidly increasing.</p><p>At this moment, Zhang Zhenjun's cultivation was at the early stage of the River Diagram realm.</p><p>In fact, he was capable of reaching a higher level, but he was limited by the Zhongmao Prefecture's Imperial Seal.</p><p>According to the Daoist Canon, under normal circumstances, even if the Imperial Seal hadn't reached its peak, the prefectural seal could grow alongside it, with cultivation improvement actually aiding the refinement of the Imperial Seal.</p><p>Outside the River of Sin, there was no need to consider the negative effects of the Six Celestial Ancient Qi on cultivators, and there were no restrictions whatsoever.</p><p>The Imperial Seal, connected to the Divine Court, was supposed to aid the Daoist Court's expansion and territorial growth, and should not have been a constraint.</p><p>The origins of the twenty-four prefectures of the Daoist Court, as well as the subordinate, paired, and itinerant prefectures, all stemmed from true cultivators dedicated to territorial expansion. They would first select a geomantically auspicious location, establish a prefecture altar, then refine the Imperial Seal, teach and spread the Dao, gradually expanding their influence.</p><p>The Divine Court's slumber, its self-sealing within a realm, prevented the further refinement of the Imperial Seal.</p><p>The Jushan Prefecture's Imperial Seal, the closest to completion among the four prefectures, was destroyed; the Gangshan Prefecture was occupied by demons; and the cultivators of this realm were unable to escape the Six Celestial Ancient Qi, resulting in this unforeseen predicament for the Daoist Court's ancestors.</p><p>An Imperial Seal that had not reached its peak had limitations in its protective capabilities; the wielder could choose to distribute its 'power' or hoard it.</p><p>If Zhang Zhenjun monopolized the Imperial Seal, the Tianshu Academy would be left without a Grand True Cultivator, while he could advance to the mid-stage. The cost, however, would be the stagnation and disruption of the Daoist school's younger generation.</p><p>He didn't do so; neither did the previous Tianshu Academy's Grand Minister.  Their cultivation remained at the early stage of the River Diagram realm until their final tribulation approached, leading them to venture deep into the Abyss of Sin, using their last strength to pave the way for their successors before vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Before departing, they entrusted the Upper Clarity Tianshu Academy Seal, symbolizing the Grand Minister's position, and the Zhongmao Prefecture's Imperial Seal, to their chosen successors.</p><p>The Daoist Court's True Cultivators acted thus, as did the Great Saints of the Guifang Kingdom.</p><p>Even with years of accumulated cultivation, they could easily break through to the mid-stage of the River Diagram realm and overcome their final tribulation. After all, those who emerged from the Daoist school were all exceptionally gifted.</p><p>Yet, they still willingly met their deaths, so that their legacy could continue.</p><p>Without unforeseen circumstances, Zhang Zhenjun might have followed in the footsteps of the previous Tianshu Academy Grand Minister.</p><p>Until Tianyue Shangren's arrival, bringing a turning point.</p><p>After the Jushan Prefecture altar battle, Left True Person and others self-immolated, allowing Zhang Zhenjun to reclaim the 'power', and he secretly began to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Now, with the Divine Court's return, the Imperial Seal is gradually restoring its connection with the Divine Court, and the limitations no longer exist!</p><p>In the grand halls of Zhongmao Prefecture and Baishi Prefecture, the cultivation of the two Daoist Court True Cultivators is rapidly increasing.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Divine Court.</p><p>Qin Sang rode in the dragon chariot, soaring through the clouds.</p><p>He had almost completely deciphered the talisman, and was using its power to try and control the Divine Inspection Chariot.</p><p>The golden dragon continued its relentless flight, but the frequency of its tail swishes had noticeably increased, its roars increasingly agitated.</p><p>Qin Sang banished distracting thoughts, his hands gripping the jade seat firmly, attempting to harmonize his mind with the chariot.</p><p>On the horizon, the pillars of energy grew more prominent, stirring the clouds into a frenzy. Some pillars of energy weakened and dissipated into nothingness, while others grew increasingly powerful.</p><p>From the signs, they would soon pierce the clouds and enter the Divine Court.</p><p>Inside the Divine Court, the immortal palaces and pavilions were silent, save for a single dragon chariot speeding through the clouds—too conspicuous.</p><p>The eyes within the energy pillars, filled with intense malice, locked onto Qin Sang. His time was running out.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The dragon's roar suddenly turned shrill, causing the Divine Inspection Chariot to become unstable, and Qin Sang's body swayed with it.</p><p>The roar relentlessly assaulted Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Qin Sang still didn't understand what kind of being the golden dragon was.</p><p>Was it living or dead?</p><p>Was it a dragon soul imprisoned within the chariot, the chariot's spirit, or perhaps simply part of the chariot itself, lacking intelligence but appearing animated?</p><p>The Divine Inspection Chariot was beyond Qin Sang's understanding of the art of refinement; he had no time to carefully study it, and could only place his hopes on the talisman.</p><p>The good news was that no matter how 'angry' the golden dragon's roars were, it hadn't launched any attacks on Qin Sang.</p><p>After a brief probe, Qin Sang no longer hesitated, his finger imbued with true essence, drawing the talisman in mid-air.</p><p>Once the talisman was complete, he swept his hand, striking the golden dragon at the back of its head.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The talisman transformed into a streak of light, piercing the scales at the back of the golden dragon's head, and sinking into its body.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The golden dragon suddenly started thrashing its head wildly, as if struggling against something.</p><p>Surprisingly, even in this state, the golden dragon continued to struggle forward.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished, his tense mind relaxing slightly.</p><p>Jinlong's initial ferocity seemed to lessen as the sigil took effect;  resistance against Qin Sang was weakening, showing signs of initial control.</p><p>Qin Sang, diverting a sliver of his attention, opened his eyes, surveying the surroundings within the Divine Court.</p><p>The scene before him differed greatly from his initial view upon entering the South Heavenly Gate.  </p><p>He realized the Divine Court wasn't as idyllic as he'd imagined.  The celestial paradise glimpsed outside was a stark contrast to the considerable decay within:  shattered mountain peaks, and collapsed palaces reduced to ruins.</p><p>Yet, pristine golden palaces also existed, their closed gates radiating a brilliant light, illuminating the mountains with an otherworldly glow.</p><p>The Divine Court appeared to have endured a devastating war, with intact structures being a rare sight.</p><p>His gaze moved past the carriage, drawn to something that captivated Jinlong.  There, amidst shifting clouds and brilliant lights, lay a celestial scene far surpassing the surrounding mountains and palaces.</p><p>Countless mountains and palaces reached towards the heavens, a breathtaking spectacle.</p><p>This was the true celestial palace, the Emperor of Heaven's residence!</p><p>If Qin Sang guessed correctly, this was the heart of the Divine Court, but its nature remained a mystery.</p><p>Awe filled his eyes as he activated his Celestial Eye ability. Sadly, he found the core even more damaged than the outskirts—broken bridges, crumbling mountains, and widespread ruin.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression shifted as his gaze swept across the landscape, taking in the mountains and palaces.  A thoughtful look crossed his face.</p><p>For some reason, the Divine Court felt strangely familiar.</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, he identified the source: the layout of the mountains and palaces.</p><p>"It mirrors the constellations of the heavens! When the Daoist Court created the Divine Court, did they emulate the celestial array?"</p><p>Qin Sang, having studied the "Seven Mansions Sector Sword Formation," possessed a deep understanding of the constellations.</p><p>People divided the celestial bodies into the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Mansions, viewing them as the abodes of gods and imbuing them with extraordinary significance.</p><p>The Three Enclosures—Purple Forbidden Enclosure, Great Brightness Enclosure, and Heavenly Market Enclosure—formed the core of the celestial sphere.</p><p>The Twenty-Eight Mansions surrounded the Three Enclosures, divided into the Four Symbols—Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise—according to the four cardinal directions, encompassing all the celestial bodies.</p><p>The "Seven Mansions Sector Sword Formation" mimicked the Western White Tiger's seven mansions.</p><p>The Daoist sect incorporated the constellations into the Divine Court, each mountain and palace representing a star.</p><p>Qin Sang's current location seemed to be within the Southern Seven Mansions, and judging by the arrangement, the palaces ahead were the Three Enclosures.</p><p>"But what lies above the Three Enclosures?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, a question in his eyes.</p><p>At the center of the Three Enclosures, towering clouds resembled a celestial realm upon a realm, endless tiers of palaces.</p><p>It resembled a colossal celestial mountain, soaring majestically, piercing the clouds, reaching the very limits of the universe.</p><p>Glimmering light and thunder and lightning crackled above.</p><p>Straining his eyes, Qin Sang saw the second heaven, a sight that shocked him.</p><p>It was utterly desolate, with only a few palaces remaining.</p><p>The higher heavens were the same.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, what he saw was the nine heavens of the original Divine Court, created by the Divine Thunder Sect, later called Thunder City.</p><p>After the second Divine Thunder Assembly, the Daoist sect reformed, but the nine heavens were not abandoned; they were integrated with the new Divine Court, dedicated to the Thunder Gods.</p><p>The new Divine Court mimicked the celestial constellations, based on the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Mansions, establishing thirty-two heavens, solidifying the four cardinal directions and eight extreme points, and enshrining gods besides the Thunder Department.</p><p>In the end, the two Divine Courts became indistinguishable.</p><p>"A magnificent Celestial Constellation Array!"</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze from Thunder City, surveying his surroundings in admiration.</p><p>Clearly, the Divine Court's arrangement wasn't a simple correspondence with the stars, but a profound, intricate formation.</p><p>He wondered about any connection between the "Seven Mansions Sector Sword Formation" and the Daoist Court's Celestial Constellation Array.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the comment from the True Person of the Sword concerning the "Seven Mansions Sector Sword Formation," suggesting that by gathering the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Mansions, a new celestial phenomenon would emerge.</p><p>Given the opportunity to study the Divine Court, he might be able to use the "Seven Mansions Sector Sword Formation" as a foundation to create a rudimentary Celestial Constellation Sword Formation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the situation wouldn't allow it.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Jinlong let out a long roar, the reins around its neck suddenly taut, halting its charge.</p><p>Qin Sang held the other end, pulling back with all his might.</p><p>Jinlong, still unwilling to submit, thrashed its head and tail, but couldn't break free.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief; he had managed to gain a degree of control over the Divine Inspection Chariot.</p><p>Although not fully in control,  Qin Sang managed to steer the Golden Dragon away from its previous course.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>Qin Sang jerked the reins. The Golden Dragon shook its head, seemingly reluctant, but obeyed, swishing its tail and changing direction, flying west.</p><p>At that moment, pillars of energy erupted from the clouds, signaling the arrival of demons.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure of the demons' purpose in invading the Divine Court, suspecting their target was likely the San Yuan region at the court's heart.  He naturally tried to avoid that area, instinctively choosing the Western Seven Mansions, a region he knew well, hoping for a peaceful passage.</p><p>However, judging by Tian Yue Shangren's tone, the demons wouldn't let him be.  Qin Sang dared not relax, focusing on mastering the Celestial Inspection Chariot.</p><p>…</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The white clouds churned into a tempest.</p><p>Pillar after pillar relentlessly bombarded the cloud sea. A deafening roar shook the surrounding immortal mountains and caused the palaces to tremble.  Two pillars, one black and one green, underwent a sudden transformation, expanding dramatically.</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>Two shadowy figures burst from the pillars, their laughter echoing as they invaded the Divine Court.</p><p>The laughter sent a shiver down Qin Sang's spine.  He stared in horror as two terrifying demonic beast phantoms loomed in the sky, colossal in size—two Demon King apparitions!</p><p>The black phantom was covered in dark feathers, its giant wings casting a shadow over half the heavens. Qin Sang recognized it instantly—the black demonic roc that had ambushed them outside the Jushan altar.</p><p>The other Demon King was a green-scaled serpent, its crimson tongue flicking, half the size of the roc but exuding an equally powerful aura.</p><p>Two monstrous demons stood before the heavens, their eyes fixed on the Divine Court. It was a scene of imminent demonic occupation.</p><p>The black roc's eyes, sharp as lightning, swiftly scanned the surroundings, pausing at the San Yuan region before looking up at the Thunder City, its admiration and awe undisguised. It exclaimed, "The Daoist scriptures did not lie! Those old fogies weren't exaggerating."</p><p>With a gentle flap of its wings, the roc displayed a look of contentment.  "It seems the Demon God is no myth! Here in the Divine Court, we shall thrive!"</p><p>The green-scaled serpent's scales shimmered, creating a rustling sound as red and blue light alternated.  It nodded in agreement, gazing at Thunder City for a moment before fixating on the Celestial Inspection Chariot.  Its red vertical pupils glowed with a crimson light.</p><p>Sitting on the chariot with his back to the demons, Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>"That must be the Daoist Court's Celestial Inspection Chariot.  I wonder where he obtained it. If the Daoist Court had held onto it, the Divine Court would have been opened long ago.  This treasure, lost for years, has suddenly reappeared. This person must know many secrets!  The Celestial Inspection Chariot might even be useful to us. I'll go capture him, you two go raid the Divine Firmament Upper Palace… Old Serpent, you know where it is, right?"  The black roc turned, speaking rapidly.</p><p>The green serpent glanced coldly at the roc before looking up at the heavens, its gaze piercing the nine layers of the sky towards the summit of Thunder City.</p><p>The Divine Firmament Upper Palace was situated high above the heavens.</p><p>The Daoist Court's officials held varying ranks and positions. For example, Zhang Hai Chan, the Zhang True Monarch, held the rank of Zheng Erpin , the Minister of the Tian Shu Academy, and the Supreme Governor of the Nine Heavens Golden Que.  The "Nine Heavens Golden Que" here refers specifically to the Divine Firmament Upper Palace.</p><p>For the Daoist sect, the Divine Firmament Upper Palace held immense significance, the residence of the Celestial Master, from where celestial mandates originated.  The three Divine Firmament conferences determined the fate of the Daoist sect.</p><p>Furthermore, the Divine Firmament Upper Palace was the core of the Daoist Divine Court, containing the key secrets to controlling it.</p><p>Imperial Edict: Control the Divine Firmament Upper Palace at all costs!</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The green serpent's voice was raspy, its tone as cold as its gaze, as it studied the summit of Thunder City.</p><p>"I'm going!"</p><p>With a boisterous laugh, the black roc beat its wings, creating a whirlwind of clouds, its dark feathers obscuring the sky as it swooped down towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the green serpent slithered, transforming into a crimson streak towards the San Yuan region.</p><p>Other energy pillars subsequently displayed strange phenomena. Some were destroyed, but most managed to hold their ground.</p><p>More and more demon gods entered the Divine Court.</p><p>The immortal realm was on the verge of becoming a demonic dominion. </p>
