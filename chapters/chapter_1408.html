<h1>Chapter 1400: The Three Spirits Pan Wang Array</h1><p>An incense stick later.</p><p>The cave was silent.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave, lost in thought.</p><p>No wonder Valley Master Mu first touted the Jing Hai Sect and the Myriad Spirit Fruit, his words full of guile.</p><p>The so-called Three Spirits Pan Wang Array uses three spirit insects, utilizing an altar, to create an insect formation.</p><p>Under the combined effects of the insect formation and the altar, the power of two spirit insects can be drawn and infused into a third, forcibly enhancing the third spirit insect's abilities.</p><p>This third spirit insect is also called the main insect.</p><p>The Three Spirits Pan Wang Array has no requirements for the insect species.</p><p>However, there is one condition: one of the two insects whose power is being drawn must be of a higher cultivation level than the main insect, and the other must be at least on par with the main insect.</p><p>This condition is easy to meet.</p><p>Valley Master Mu not only possesses the fourth-stage soul insect, the Sea-Drawing Horseshoe Crab, but has also cultivated a late third-stage Black Magic Ant.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't even need to use the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang's hesitation stems from the fact that the Three Spirits Pan Wang Array will severely damage the main insect.</p><p>The insects whose power is drawn will at most be weakened for a short time.</p><p>But the main insect must endure power beyond its limits, forcibly activating its abilities. A single misstep could result in it exploding on the spot.</p><p>Furthermore, there's no guarantee of finding the entrance to the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>"You must have tried it with the Jade-Biting Bees, right?" Qin Sang pondered for a long time before asking.</p><p>Valley Master Mu hesitated, knowing it was impossible to hide this from Qin Sang. He nodded and sighed, "The difference in cultivation was too great. The insect formation didn't run for long before the Jade-Biting Bee exploded from the strain.  Rest assured, Daoist, I will personally oversee the Three Spirits Pan Wang Array and minimize the harm to the Fire Jade Centipede.  As long as we find the Myriad Spirit Fruit, the Fire Jade Centipede will fully recover."</p><p>He was well aware of the value of a third-stage Fire Jade Centipede, so he offered this reassurance.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang silent,</p><p>Valley Master Mu quickly added, "Qi Daoist and the others don't practice insect control. Besides the Ascending Spirit Ceremony given to you, we will split the Myriad Spirit Fruit evenly.  If there are other treasures in the Jing Hai Sect, we'll each use our own methods to obtain them; whoever gets it first keeps it. I swear to this.  Daoist, what do you think?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he added two conditions, "Regardless of success or failure, I require a copy of the Three Spirits Pan Wang Array formation method.  Furthermore, I wish to observe the Hundred Flowers Valley's insect control techniques."</p><p>Valley Master Mu looked troubled.</p><p>The Three Spirits Pan Wang Array was relatively inconsequential; there was little chance of using it again.</p><p>But the insect control techniques were the foundation of Hundred Flowers Valley, something that could not be easily revealed.</p><p>"Then let's start with the Three Spirits Pan Wang Array. After we find the entrance to the Jing Hai Sect, you can fulfill the second condition. I swear on my inner demons that I will not reveal your sect's insect control techniques to anyone," Qin Sang proactively made a vow to ease Valley Master Mu's concerns.</p><p>Valley Master Mu hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement.</p><p>"Good! It's a deal!"</p><p>"It's a deal!"</p><p>…</p><p>Having reached an agreement,</p><p>the two immediately left the cave and flew towards the Kong Ling Sea.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang carefully inquired about the Jing Hai Sect's formations from Valley Master Mu.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised to learn that the Jing Hai Sect was a Buddhist sect.</p><p>Having traveled through Bei Chen Realm, Cang Lang Sea, and spent a long time exploring the North Sea, Qin Sang knew that these three areas were dominated by Daoism, with Buddhism being relatively weak.</p><p>Buddhist traditions were fragmented; even a prominent sect was hard to find.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang encountered such a powerful Buddhist sect.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was clear that Valley Master Mu hadn't revealed everything; he had certainly withheld some information and hadn't told him the full story.</p><p>Perhaps the Jing Hai Sect and the Witch Clan had some connection.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley's founder originated from the Kong Ling Sea and received a legacy from the Witch Clan, while the Jing Hai Sect was a hidden sect in this area. There were surely secrets hidden within.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed to use the Fire Jade Centipede for the Three Spirits Pan Wang Array because the Fire Jade Centipede was approaching a bottleneck and was less important to him than the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>It was a gamble, but an acceptable cost.</p><p>Moreover, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly might be able to break the formation; he might not even need the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Kong Ling Sea was indeed as rumored.</p><p>Surrounded by endless seawater, monotonous and unchanging, they flew for a long time without seeing a single island.</p><p>The sea surface was calm, almost without a ripple.</p><p>After entering the Kong Ling Sea, Qin Sang followed Valley Master Mu for another hour, arriving at a desolate sea area.</p><p>Valley Master Mu suddenly landed on the surface of the sea and flicked his finger, sending a beam of light into the water.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang sensed two auras rapidly approaching from the seabed.</p><p>‘Splash…’</p><p>Two figures broke the surface of the water.</p><p>A man and a woman.</p><p>A tall, slender man, dressed in Taoist robes and a tall hat, with prominent cheekbones, was indeed the Qi Daoist mentioned by Mu Guzhu.</p><p>The female cultivator, also in a Daoist robe, was a close friend of the Qi cultivator, surnamed Wang.</p><p>Both were at the early Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>“Daoist Qi! Daoist Wang!”</p><p>Qin Sang, having been introduced by Mu Guzhu, stepped forward and bowed.</p><p>“Greetings, Daoist Mingyue!”</p><p>The two returned the greeting, both smiling warmly.</p><p>After some pleasantries, the four of them submerged underwater.</p><p>The sea surface quickly returned to calm.</p><p>“How deep is the Jinghai Sect underwater?” Qin Sang asked via voice transmission, seeing them continue to descend.</p><p>“Almost there,” the Qi cultivator turned around, “Didn’t Daoist Mu tell you, Daoist? The Jinghai Sect should be built on an island, but we can’t find that island now.  Moreover, the array is very strange. If it weren’t for a previous anomaly, even if I passed by here, I probably wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and said, “It’s difficult to describe it accurately with words alone. I need to experience it myself to fully understand the array's peculiarities.”</p><p>Mu Guzhu slowed their descent to match their pace, turning to ask the Qi cultivator, “Have there been any new changes these days?”</p><p>The Qi cultivator shook his head. “Since that brief anomaly, nothing else has happened. This time, it depends on the two Daoists' skills. If it still doesn't work, we may have to try our luck at the Wanmo Assembly.”</p><p>“Wanmo Assembly?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes showed surprise.</p><p>Mu Guzhu made a sound of acknowledgement, explaining, “Daoist, you’ve only just arrived in the Boundless Sea, so you may not know. The next Wanmo Assembly will be held in nine years.  It's like an auction or trade fair for Yuan Ying cultivators in the Boundless Sea.  At that time, all the experts of the Boundless Sea will gather at Hunmo Island, regardless of whether they are of the demonic path, and even demon kings may appear. However, all the factions in the Boundless Sea have an agreement—even if they have deep grudges against each other, they may not fight on Hunmo Island; otherwise, they will face joint retaliation. With Hunmo Elder personally overseeing it, there hasn't been a single incident of anyone daring to break the rules in any of the past Wanmo Assemblies. If you are interested, Daoist, you can go and take a look…”</p><p>The Qi cultivator nodded. “That’s right.  In every Wanmo Assembly, valuable treasures appear, and there might be something that can break this array. Before the Wanmo Assembly, a vague list of treasures will leak out. Daoist, you can check if there’s anything you are interested in.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully.</p>
