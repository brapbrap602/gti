<h1>Chapter 1120: Dual Calamity</h1><p>The fierce winds showed no signs of abating. The thick wall of wind nearly blocked out the light of the spirit formation. Just as Qin Sang was filled with doubt and unease, Bai hurried over from the other side, his expression grave. He pointed to the sky and said, "There's something unusual about the heavenly tribulation."</p><p>Li Yufu also flew over, his face pale with panic. "Uncle-Master, why is Grandmaster unable to overcome the wind calamity?"</p><p>Following Bai's pointing finger, they all turned their gaze to the center of the dark clouds above. At this moment, the clouds were densely packed with lightning, countless arcs flickering in and out of existence, each as thick as an arm. The lightning transformed the dark clouds into thunderclouds, which were now evolving into calamity clouds!</p><p>Calamity lightning was part of the heavenly tribulation, fundamentally different from ordinary lightning. This was why cultivators feared it so deeply.</p><p>As the lightning intertwined, the thunderclouds grew larger. Gradually, green arcs of lightning began to appear within the thunderclouds. At first, they were as thin as threads, barely noticeable. But soon, even the thicker bolts of lightning began to transform into green.</p><p>"Green calamity lightning!" Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>For cultivators undergoing tribulation, the lightning of the heavenly tribulation was green! From a distance, the sight of the green calamity lightning sent a shiver through Qin Sang's heart. He could sense a terrifying aura of destruction, along with a hint of the Heavenly Dao's might, filling him with a deep chill.</p><p>He had been struck by lightning countless times while practicing the *Art of Thunder Manipulation*, but he had never felt such fear before. There was no doubtâ€”if anyone dared to practice the *Art of Thunder Manipulation* at this moment and tried to draw the calamity lightning into their body, they would be reduced to ashes. The *Art of Thunder Manipulation* was incapable of controlling calamity lightning.</p><p>However, Bai wasn't pointing at the green calamity lightning.</p><p>"Huh? What's that golden light?" Qin Sang finally noticed a tiny speck of golden light, no larger than a bean, deep within the calamity clouds. It was small, but it stood out starkly against the green calamity clouds.</p><p>At this moment, the fierce winds surrounding Yunyouzi began to dissipate. The calamity clouds were now fully formed. After overcoming the wind calamity, the one undergoing tribulation would only have a brief moment of respite before facing the lightning tribulation.</p><p>What was shocking was that the calamity clouds were not purely green! The speck of golden light grew larger and larger, eventually dyeing half of the calamity clouds gold!</p><p>"Dual-colored calamity clouds!" Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, and he couldn't help but exclaim in shock.</p><p>He quickly turned to look at Bai, only to find Bai staring intently at the calamity clouds, his brows furrowed in silence.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang had never heard of dual-colored calamity clouds. The Nascent Soul tribulation for cultivators should only involve green heavenly lightning. Yunyouzi was also a cultivator, so why were there dual-colored calamity clouds during his tribulation?</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A deafening roar shook the heavens and the earth. The calamity clouds churned violently. The two-colored clouds were clearly distinct, with arcs of green and golden lightning leaping within them. The surrounding dark clouds, unable to withstand the terrifying heavenly might, were torn apart.</p><p>The world brightened slightly, but Qin Sang's face was now clouded with gloom, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>A terrifying scene unfolded. Within the dual-colored calamity clouds, calamity lightning was being simultaneously condensed. Seeing this, everyone's faces turned pale with fear.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The heavens trembled.</p><p>Two bolts of calamity lightning, sharp as swords, shot down from the calamity clouds simultaneously, striking the light barrier formed by the spirit formation with equal force.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were blinded by the dazzling green and golden light, unable to see the true form of the calamity lightning. The moment the lightning struck the formation, the two bolts nearly merged, their power surging to a horrifying level, far surpassing that of ordinary calamity lightning!</p><p>The light barrier dimmed abruptly. The myriad illusions swirling within it shattered in an instant. Some of the formation treasures supporting the barrier cracked, and spirit banners snapped.</p><p>The calamity lightning pierced through the light barrier, its power diminished by the spirit formation. But this was only the beginning. As the first bolt of heavenly lightning fell, the entire space was filled with deafening thunder. One after another, dual-colored calamity lightning bolts shot down from the calamity clouds.</p><p>Most of the lightning was aimed directly at Yunyouzi, but the spirit island was also affected. The island, already small in size, saw its rocks reduced to dust under the lightning, and even the solitary peak was shaved down a layer.</p><p>Wave after wave of calamity lightning struck. The spirit formation struggled to hold on, but scattered threads of lightning penetrated through, only to be blocked by a silver-white orb.</p><p>It was Yunyouzi's treasure, the Flawless Pearl.</p><p>But the respite was short-lived.</p><p>After a brief pause, the calamity lightning struck again, even more powerful than before.</p><p>"Bring it on!" Yunyouzi's silver hair whipped wildly as he roared at the heavens like a madman.</p><p>He hastily consumed a pill and summoned several magical treasures. The power of the calamity lightning grew increasingly terrifying. Under the onslaught of the thick bolts, the spirit formation's light dimmed, and one formation treasure after another was destroyed. The formation was on its last legs.</p><p>This spirit formation had been prepared for the entire lightning tribulation, yet it was being destroyed so quickly!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The spirit formation and the calamity lightning were both obliterated.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye technique to its fullest extent, but all he could see were the green and golden flashes of lightning. He couldn't make out Yunyouzi's condition at all. Even his Heavenly Eye Butterfly began to feel uncomfortable under the intense light.</p><p>Seeing the light of the spirit formation extinguished, Qin Sang's heart sank. There was no longer any hope.</p><p>His face pale, he looked up at the thunderclouds. The calamity clouds churned endlessly, as if containing an infinite amount of thunderous power.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The calamity lightning continued to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a wave of despair. If he were in Yunyouzi's place, he wouldn't be able to survive such a terrifying tribulation either.</p><p>But to everyone's astonishment, Yunyouzi was still alive! He endured wave after wave of calamity lightning, still holding on!</p><p>A glimmer of hope rose in Qin Sang's heart, and he clenched his fists tightly. It was a pity he couldn't offer Yunyouzi any assistance.</p><p>Finally, the calamity clouds began to shrink.</p><p>Seeing this, Li Yufu was overjoyed, but his expression quickly turned to fear.</p><p>Just as it seemed Yunyouzi was about to overcome the lightning tribulation, the dual-colored calamity clouds underwent another transformation. The green and golden lightning began to merge, intertwining until they truly became one.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank to the depths!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The final heavenly tribulation descended.</p><p>The two types of calamity lightning merged into one, forming a massive green-gold bolt that shot out of the calamity clouds like a colossal sword. It carried an overwhelming aura of destruction and heavenly might, striking down toward the solitary peak!</p><p>Even from this distance, they could feel the awe-inspiring power of this calamity lightning, trembling in its presence.</p><p>It was unimaginable what kind of destructive force Yunyouzi, who was facing the tribulation head-on, was enduring.</p><p>"Grandmaster!" Li Yufu cried out, his face filled with grief.</p><p>Qin Sang's lips were tightly pressed together, devoid of any color.</p><p>He had never anticipated something like this happening.</p><p>Yunyouzi had made so many preparations. There shouldn't have been any accidents. Yet, the power of this heavenly tribulation far exceeded that of other cultivators. This was not what a Nascent Soul tribulation should be like.</p><p>If this terrifying tribulation had been an ordinary one, Yunyouzi would have already overcome it long ago.</p><p>Why was this happening?</p><p>When Yunyouzi had entrusted Li Yufu to him earlier, it wasn't just a precautionary measure. Had Yunyouzi foreseen something back then?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered something Yunyouzi had said back in the Purple Star Palace: "In my life, I have faced two great calamities. Beyond these, nothing else is worth worrying about. Forming a Nascent Soul? For me, it's as easy as reaching into a bag and taking something out!"</p><p>The first calamity was the tribulation of incomplete soul and rebirth through fire.</p><p>Could the second calamity be this Nascent Soul tribulation?</p>
