<h1>Chapter 1522: Relocating the Sect (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1522: Relocating the Sect (4k)</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>After visiting Mu Yifeng, Qin Sang spent a month traveling and visiting old friends.</p><p>Most of his time was spent in Xiaohan Region.</p><p>It was like retracing half his cultivation journey.</p><p>Having reached the Yuan Ying stage, Qin Sang’s temperament wouldn't be greatly affected by this journey. His purpose was simply to see things again and reminisce about the past.</p><p>His departure for the Central Plains meant he didn't know when he would return.</p><p>After his travels, Qin Sang finally came to Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Unable to return to the Seven Kills Hall, he could only pay his respects at the tomb of Elder Qingzhu, remembering his final words.</p><p>Inside the wooden pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang placed four wine cups on the table.</p><p>He tried to conserve it, but his treasured Peach Blossom wine was nearly gone. This wine was meticulously brewed by Senior Sister Qingjun, its sweetness and crispness far surpassing others.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t brew it, nor did he want to learn.</p><p>He raised his cup.</p><p>One cup to commemorate Qingzhu.</p><p>Two cups offered remotely to his Senior Sister and Bai.</p><p>…</p><p>Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>A large gathering was held before the restricted area.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, Shangguan Li Feng, Mei Gu, Zhao Ying, and other renowned Golden Core cultivators were all present.</p><p>“Senior Brother, what important matter is the Temple Master announcing? Did he bring back some treasure from the North Sea?” Zhao Ying asked Li Yu Fu softly, beside him.</p><p>Zhao Ying had the least interaction with Qin Sang, her previous understanding limited to rumors, making her both respectful and apprehensive of him.</p><p>After Qingjun ascended, she joined the Green Sheep Temple.  Initially worried about being ostracized, she found the Temple to be mutually respectful and harmonious, lacking any power struggles, and finally felt a sense of belonging.</p><p>“Sect affairs have always been handled by Junior Brother Tan.  If there's any major development within the Temple, Junior Brother Tan should know best. Why isn't he here?”</p><p>Mei Gu interjected, looking around and not finding Tan Yi En.</p><p>“Senior Sister just returned, so you don’t know yet?”</p><p>Bai Hanqiu said enviously, “Senior Brother Tan has made it big.  Senior Tan and the Master reunited in the North Sea and returned together. Furthermore, Senior Tan is now a Yuan Ying cultivator, and the Master has invited him to be the Grand Elder of the Green Sheep Temple.”</p><p>“Yuan Ying!”</p><p>Mei Gu was overjoyed.</p><p>The stronger the Green Sheep Temple, the more its disciples would benefit.</p><p>Jing Yu was close to the Green Sheep Temple, but more in the capacity of a guest elder.</p><p>The Green Sheep Temple was still in its early stages, with only a Temple Master, and no elders.</p><p>Tan Hao was the first.</p><p>After her joy subsided, Mei Gu remembered something and giggled, “Junior Brother Tan probably won't be able to continue his carefree life? Before, I was so envious of his ability to avoid the hardships of cultivation.”</p><p>Bai Hanqiu shrugged, just about to speak when a swirling mist parted in the restricted area, revealing a small path, from which Qin Sang’s voice called out, specifically requesting Li Yu Fu and the others to enter.</p><p>Everyone became silent and respectful, walking into the restricted area without looking around.</p><p>Qin Sang had just returned from the Green Sheep Temple’s spirit vein, planting the root of the Myriad Spirits Fruit tree, setting up protective formations, and carefully nurturing it.</p><p>“Greetings, Temple Master!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the others bowed together.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, gesturing for them to rise, and pointed to Tan Hao, who was sitting beside him, saying, “From now on, Brother Tan will be the Grand Elder of the Green Sheep Temple.  Seeing Elder Tan is equivalent to seeing me.”</p><p>Tan Yi En stood behind Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure how the father and son communicated.</p><p>He only knew that Tan Yi En remained as aloof as ever, while Tan Hao looked helpless.</p><p>“We obey! Greetings, Elder Tan!”</p><p>After paying their respects, Li Yu Fu and the others dared to steal glances at Tan Hao.</p><p>He was tall and strong, with a noble bearing.</p><p>They had all heard Tan Yi En speak of the story between Qin Sang and Tan Hao, knowing him to be someone of great loyalty and a true hero, inspiring their respect.</p><p>Tan Hao returned their bows, looking at these outstanding juniors and secretly nodding in approval. He admired Qin Sang not only for his rapid cultivation progress but also for his ability to establish a sect.</p><p>After introducing Tan Hao, Qin Sang announced two more momentous events: the relocation of the sect and the passing of the Temple Master position to Li Yu Fu.</p><p>He had originally wanted the highest-cultivation Tan Hao to lead, but Tan Hao firmly declined.</p><p>One shocking announcement after another left the disciples stunned, unable to believe their ears, taking a long time to slowly process everything.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t allow for any argument; he already had a plan for the sect’s arrangements and issued orders methodically.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned Li Yu Fu and the others individually.</p><p>Li Yu Fu accepted the responsibility of Temple Master, but requested to remain in Beichen Region.</p><p>Although he longed for a broader world, he understood that cultivation was the foundation and planned to continue his arduous training until he reached the peak of the Golden Core stage, then facing the Yuan Ying bottleneck, he would go to the North Sea to seek opportunities.</p><p>Another reason was that the North Sea's situation was complex, with intense conflicts unlike Beichen Region.</p><p>Compared to powerful factions like Xuan Tiangong, Qingyang Guan is still relatively weak. Tan Hao must personally stay in Beihai to protect it, even Jing Yu often needs to assist.</p><p>Beichen is Qingyang Guan's rear base, and it requires a high-ranking individual to oversee it. Li Yu Fu is the ideal choice.</p><p>The second is Mei Gu.</p><p>She readily requested Qin Sang to take her to Beihai.</p><p>Previously, she was bound by her responsibilities to Moyanmen.</p><p>After Qin Sang's return, Mei Gu shed her burdens, finally able to follow her heart.  She travels extensively whenever possible without hindering her cultivation, her footsteps covering almost all of Beichen, encountering both opportunities and dangers.</p><p>Learning that the three realms of Beihai are far more vast and exciting than Beichen, Mei Gu's eyes lit up; she could barely wait.</p><p>If Qin Sang offered to take her to Zhongzhou, Mei Gu would likely accept without hesitation.</p><p>The third is Shangguan Lifeng.</p><p>He shares Mei Gu's decision.</p><p>However, his goal is to meet fellow swordsmen and witness more exquisite sword techniques.</p><p>His previous focus on blade techniques and the path of killing had delayed his cultivation, nearly preventing him from forming his Golden Core and ending his lifespan prematurely. After obtaining the "Qingzhu Sword Scripture," Shangguan Lifeng became engrossed, completely forgetting his past lessons.</p><p>He frankly told Qin Sang that, knowing he hasn't yet broken through to the mid-Golden Core stage and his chances of forming a Nascent Soul are slim, he only wishes to wholeheartedly pursue the sword path and achieve something.</p><p>If one day he can cultivate a successor to carry on the legacy of Elder Qingzhu, it would be a fulfilling life.</p><p>Then there's Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Over the years, she's enjoyed a happy marriage, bearing one son and two daughters, experiencing the joys of family. While she envies the surpassing cultivation of many younger disciples, she has no regrets.</p><p>She doesn't wish to leave her family and go to Beihai.</p><p>She is content to spend her remaining years there.</p><p>As for Tan Yi'en, Qin Sang knows without asking that he will go to Beihai.</p><p>Tan Yi'en's lifelong ambition has shifted from creating the number one sect in Beichen to creating the number one sect in Beihai. He is eager and ambitious.</p><p>After Tan Yi'en's departure, Bai Hanqiu will take over his administrative duties.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's eldest daughter possesses a cultivation talent, similar in age to Qin Nian Sui.  She had previously asked Qin Sang to arrange a marriage between them.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang took out a jade, cut it into two pendants, suspended them in his palm, and refined them into protective talismans using demonic fire, giving them to Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Finally, there's Zhao Ying.</p><p>She inherited Qing Jun's lineage, and Qin Sang treats her as his own junior disciple.</p><p>Zhao Ying decided to remain in Beichen for now, assisting Li Yu Fu, and move to Beihai when the time is right.</p><p>"Have you ever seen these two items?"</p><p>Qin Sang brought out the Yang Puppet Crystal and the puppet of Gui General.</p><p>He had researched them for a long time without any leads.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qing Jun was not around.</p><p>Zhao Ying, having been close to Qing Jun, might have heard of them.</p><p>Zhao Ying took the crystal and puppet, examining them closely for a while, her brow furrowing deeper.  After apologizing, she sat cross-legged, closed her eyes, and performed a secret technique.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently in silence.</p><p>After two hours, Zhao Ying awoke, pointing at the puppet: "Reporting to the Abbot, I have never seen this type of puppet before. But I have a feeling that it is similar in some way to Elder Qing Jun's Qingluan puppet—created because of the master's imprint, it becomes completely inert and loses all power once the master dies; outsiders cannot control it."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully. He suspected it might be Gui General's lifebound puppet, a highly mysterious and sophisticated type in puppetry.</p><p>After a pause, seeing Qin Sang remained silent, Zhao Ying continued: "I believe Elder Qing Jun mentioned this type of crystal once.  She only briefly mentioned it might be a treasure used by ancient cultivators for making puppets, a lost art. I am unsure of its function.  This puppet hasn't been fully refined with Yin Puppet Crystals. Forgive my dullness, but I can't figure out how to separate them without damage."</p><p>Qin Sang did not reprimand her, instead showing approval.</p><p>The crystal could enhance Yuan Ying-level puppets, and Zhao Ying's insight was quite impressive.</p><p>…</p><p>The following period saw Qingyang Guan seemingly calm, yet currents of change flowed beneath the surface as preparations for the relocation were underway.</p><p>Qin Sang, learning from the Xuan Tian Palace incident, made adjustments to Qing Yang Guan, but understood that lasting peace wasn't guaranteed. The future of Qing Yang Guan rested in the hands of its disciples.</p><p>Besides the Wan Ling fruit tree, he left three things behind.</p><p>First, a map of the Central Plains Sea.</p><p>Second, the formula for Zhen Ling incense.</p><p>He established a rule: only the Guan Zhu (head of the Guan) and the Grand Elder would have access to these two items. Qing Yang Guan would need to focus on collecting the herbs needed for the incense formula.</p><p>Third, the Ji Yuan technique.</p><p>In the North Sea, this secret technique was considered equivalent to immortal arts.  Mastering it, and creating pseudo-spiritual treasures, would allow late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators to significantly increase their power.  Its revelation would cause a huge uproar across the four regions of the North Sea.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace also knew the Ji Yuan technique; it wasn't a secret.</p><p>For various reasons, Qin Sang decided to leave it behind, but placed a divine sense restriction on it. Only disciples who reached the divine sense manifestation stage could access it.</p><p>With these three things, Qing Yang Guan's foundation would rival that of other sects.</p><p>However, Qing Yang Guan remained weak, and it might take a long time before they could fully benefit from these resources.</p><p>…</p><p>Six months later.</p><p>Qin Sang personally attended the Beichen League Assembly for the last time.</p><p>News of Qing Yang Guan’s new Yuan Ying elder spread like wildfire among the sects.  Upon seeing Qin Sang, many approached him, offering their congratulations.  He didn't care about their true feelings and publicly announced his intention to enter seclusion to strive for the late-stage Yuan Ying realm.</p><p>Three days after the assembly.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao, along with Mu Yifeng and the first batch of elite disciples selected from Qing Yang Guan, secretly flew to the southernmost part of the Beichen region to rendezvous with Jing Yu and the forces of the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.</p><p>It was their first such mission, and the group was small.</p><p>Using the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle, they made stops at two shelters and safely navigated the storm belt.</p><p>Entering a new world, the disciples were initially amazed and excited. However, after several days of travel with Qin Sang, they found it rather monotonous, feeling that it wasn't much different from the Beichen region.</p><p>While bypassing the demon realm, Jing Yu, after learning the location of the Cui Ming Islands, ventured into the demon realm for a journey of her own.</p><p>The others continued without pause, arriving smoothly at the Cui Ming Islands.</p><p>Above Qing Yang Island.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared, surveying the area below.</p><p>During his absence, the island’s protective formation remained intact, untouched by anyone.</p><p>Seeing such a vast expanse of sea controlled solely by Qing Yang Guan, and learning that Qin Sang controlled other precious islands such as Jiu Jie Island, Tan Yi'en and the others were overjoyed, their hopes for the future soaring.</p><p>They had built Qing Yang Guan from nothing.  Establishing a branch sect was familiar territory.  Drawing on past experiences and lessons learned, they quickly shaped Qing Yang Island.</p><p>During this time, they finally learned about their Guan Zhu’s remarkable achievements from outsiders.  In just twenty years, he had caused a great upheaval in the Boundless Sea, his reputation spreading throughout the North Sea.  Their reverence for Qin Sang was immense.</p><p>Simultaneously, news of Qin Sang establishing a sect in the Boundless Sea spread rapidly, attracting widespread attention.</p><p>The situation in the North Sea was more complex than in the Beichen region.</p><p>The Boundless Sea was vast, with thriving merchant guilds.  Many guilds, unlike those in the Beichen region, weren't controlled by sects; they were powerful entities in their own right.  Qing Yang Guan needed to learn how to interact with them.</p><p>There were many other challenges.</p><p>But because of Qin Sang’s notorious reputation, things were simplified.  Especially since he had publicly slain the Ghost General years ago, emerging unharmed, his prowess was undeniable. Any lingering doubts were eliminated, and any restless demons and monsters vanished completely.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, representing Qing Yang Guan, frequently interacted with various factions.  Regardless of their cultivation level, everyone treated him with respect, and he enjoyed it.</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Qing Yang Guan was officially established!</p><p>Tong Lingyu emerged from seclusion and led the heads of the various branches to present celebratory gifts.</p><p>In addition, Feng Shangshi, Mu Guzhu, Yin Quan Dao Ren, and other renowned Yuan Ying cultivators from the Xuan Yue region, as well as friends Qin Sang made in the Star Sand Islands, traveled great distances to celebrate with him.</p><p>The powers of the Boundless Sea were naturally present.</p><p>The surviving demons dared not appear in person. After Qin Sang's slaying of the Ghost General, he had contacted Xuan Tian Palace to hunt down the remaining members, keeping them on edge.  They used this opportunity to send gifts as a gesture of goodwill.</p><p>The event was so grand; even the celebratory ceremonies of great cultivators were no match for it.</p><p>The attendees were all influential figures; any one of them could command the winds and rain in the Beichen region. The North Sea had so many such individuals.</p><p>Tan Yi'en and others' slight pride was shattered, realizing they had a long way to go.</p><p>No demon kings from the demon realm attended.</p><p>Jing Yu, after her extended travels, returned.</p><p>Qin Sang warned her that the Nine-Headed Great Sage was likely connected to the Feather King, and they needed to be wary of its possible actions.</p><p>Jing Yu didn't visit the Nine-Headed Great Sage, but she took a look from a distance.</p><p>This demon was a cultivated nine-headed serpent. Surprisingly, it had not yet transformed into human form, remaining in its original form, and its presence was imposing.</p><p>Qin Sang’s decision to not let Qing Yang Guan monopolize the sea chart was precisely to guard against this demon.</p><p>After the ceremony.</p><p>Shi Xue and Liuli remained on Qing Yang Island; Liuli's heavenly tribulation was imminent.</p>
