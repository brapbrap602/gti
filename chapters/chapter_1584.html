<h1>Chapter 1575: Desperate Battle</h1><p>Surrounded by demonic banners, demonic flames surged like dragons.  Qin Sang's cultivation had greatly improved, allowing him to command an even greater number of demonic flames.  The sheer scale of the inferno was so immense that upon its appearance, Wu Lao was startled, hastily stopping his advance and maintaining a safe distance, completely on guard.</p><p>Demonic flames billowed. The violent ice storm, in comparison to the demonic fire, seemed tame, instantly dispersed from a wide area. Wu Lao's pupils contracted; the danger emanating from the demonic flames surpassed even that of the sword formation moments before, prompting him to raise his Blood-Drinking Demon Halberd defensively.</p><p>“What kind of spiritual fire is this? So incredibly strange! When did such a powerful cultivator appear in Central State? This person's sword formation and spiritual flames are unlike any orthodox techniques; not even those demonic sects possess such bizarre demonic fire inheritance… Even the most yang-like flame techniques passed down through the Fire Aspect lineage of the Unseen Immortal Sect don't quite match…”</p><p>Lu Ye, though secluded, had access to information due to his ability to move freely near the Northern Wasteland.  He was familiar with the renowned experts of the major sects of this era. Yet, Qin Sang was completely unknown to him.</p><p>Despite the discrepancy with the Fire Aspect lineage's techniques, the fact that this person was near the suspected tomb of the Water Aspect Master, appearing alongside someone resembling a Water Aspect successor, inevitably sparked suspicion.</p><p>Wu Lao mused, believing the Unseen Immortal Sect to be long in decline, yet it seemed their legacy remained, still producing top-tier experts.  He thought a powerful force had always been hidden within the cultivation world, but they weren’t a match for the Eight Scenic Views or the Ganlu Zen Monastery, thus remaining in hiding. Now, with the disappearance of the Transcendent God cultivator, they dared to stir up trouble.</p><p>Wu Lao linked Qin Sang to the Unseen Immortal Sect, a misconception by a vast margin. These thoughts flashed through his mind before he saw the black fire engulfing the sky.  The Nine Nether Demonic Flames surged in waves, crushing the ice storm and sweeping toward him.</p><p>Wu Lao instinctively swung his halberd forward, slicing out a crimson halberd shadow. The Blood-Drinking Demon Halberd, refined over many years, transcended the level of a mere magic treasure; even a casual strike would leave others flustered.  And this was no ordinary halberd shadow.</p><p>Having witnessed the Seven Souls Killing Formation, Wu Lao did not dare to underestimate Qin Sang. Even his probing attack on the demonic flames was without reservation.</p><p>The shadow transformed into a blood-red halberd.  Bloodlight blazed.  The surrounding ice storm was dyed crimson, morphing into a blood storm, clashing with the black spiritual flames, its eerie nature surpassing even that of the Nine Nether Demonic Flames.</p><p>With a whoosh, the halberd shadow, possessing terrifying momentum, left a crimson scar between Qin Sang and Wu Lao, as if splitting the void.</p><p>Faced with such a formidable attack, Qin Sang remained unmoved. Under his control, the Nine Nether Demonic Flames showed no sign of slowing, transforming into a fiery dragon, seemingly seeking death, charging directly into the halberd shadow.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's audacity, Wu Lao rejoiced, though his joy was short-lived.  The halberd shadow pierced through the flames; one could see a blood-red halberd within the demonic fire dragon, cutting through it relentlessly, disintegrating the flames in its path. But the good times didn't last.  During its assault, the halberd shadow rapidly diminished, vanishing in the blink of an eye, swallowed by the demonic flames.</p><p>The halberd shadow held a hidden mechanism, yet it couldn't break through the demonic flames or approach Qin Sang, dissipating before achieving its purpose.  Qin Sang had complete confidence in his demonic flames. He remained suspended in place, perfectly still, focusing on controlling the flames.</p><p>With a roar, the demonic fire dragon consumed the halberd shadow and swooped down!</p><p>Wu Lao glanced towards the depths of the ice storm. He could faintly sense a battle underway, Yuefei was not yet dead and might even be gaining the upper hand, possibly having a chance to seize the treasure.  Unfortunately, communication with his master was impossible within the ice storm.</p><p>His gaze turned dark, resorting to the same tactic.  The Blood-Drinking Demon Halberd vibrated, leaping upwards, unleashing the God-Fixing Halberd Technique once more!  Thousands of halberd shadows appeared!</p><p>Qin Sang, well aware of the God-Fixing Halberd's power, swiftly changed his hand seals. The demonic flames rapidly converged towards the central fire lotus, the speed of the demonic fire dragon not decreasing but increasing, fiercely charging towards the attack!</p><p>A tremendous boom shook the ground.  Both Qin Sang and Wu Lao were moved by the force.  The God-Fixing Halberd had the power to restrain; with the demonic flames crashing into it, the void sealed by the halberd shadows shook violently, causing countless halberd shadows to shatter.</p><p>Boom! Boom!  The demonic flames continuously assaulted, intending to violently tear apart this God-Fixing Halberd technique!</p><p>Wu Lao was caught on the back foot, suffering the brunt of the demonic flames’ impact, his breathing constricted and his soul stagnated.  He felt an immense, terrifying pressure bearing down on him.</p><p>In shock, Wu Lao quickly raised his right hand.</p><p>A cracking sound echoed from his right arm as the sleeve ripped apart.  The exposed arm was unlike any human limb.  Black, unsettling runes covered the skin, glowing with a dark light that spread to Wu Lao’s fingers, staining his nails black.  He curled his fingers into claws, and with a powerful swipe, unleashed a shadowy black claw.</p><p>“Tearing!”</p><p>A sound like ripping cloth faintly echoed through the air.  The claw, small amidst the myriad spears, appeared insignificant. Yet, with a single grasp, combined with the power of the Divine Spear, it momentarily halted the demonic flames, as if striking a wall.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, a low hum escaping his lips.  Just as he was about to increase his force, a sudden premonition washed over him, darkening his expression.</p><p>Simultaneously, Wu Lao sensed something and glanced towards the heart of the ice storm.</p><p>First, they saw a column of azure light erupting from the storm’s depths, bathing their faces in blue, before feeling the impact and a deafening roar!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Both figures swayed.</p><p>The next moment, the mountain crumbled and the earth split.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the ice cave, Qin Sang's clone, reaching for the ice crystal, froze.  He hadn't anticipated a secondary array.</p><p>The array’s creator was meticulous, concealing the second layer remarkably well, giving no chance for reaction.  The moment the first array was broken, the second exploded.</p><p>Had Lu Ye not interfered, Qin Sang might have noticed the anomaly and prepared accordingly. Now, regret was futile.  He only managed to warn the Yan Shan Elder.</p><p>It was clearly a killing array, possibly designed to destroy the ice crystal, even at the cost of self-destruction.</p><p>Qin Sang shattered an ice pillar, grabbed the crystal, and retreated swiftly.  The Snow-Treading Divine Sword shielded him.  The Ruyi Treasure Pearl spun within him, creating a circular energy shield around his body.</p><p>Knowing he was at the heart of the killing array, Qin Sang still felt uneasy. He swept his hand overhead; his spiritual energy soared, transforming into a gigantic spiritual energy hand.</p><p>Countless blue points of light appeared within the ice cave, solidifying within the ice to form countless tiny blue arrows. While the bottom ice layer lacked arrows, the blue points of light spread, seeming to possess sentience, converging towards three locations – where the three of them stood.</p><p>From the blue light emerging from the ice pillars to the array's eruption, it was a mere instant.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The ice shattered.  A piercing, tearing sound assaulted their ears from all directions.  In an instant, the ice cave glowed a brilliant blue.</p><p>As the tearing sounds began, a powerful force slammed against the energy shield.  The shield shattered, deflecting the oncoming blue crystal arrows. A blue ice flower bloomed before Qin Sang, engulfing him.</p><p>As the one breaking the array, Qin Sang, situated at the array’s center, bore the brunt of the attack, receiving almost half the arrows. His shield was transformed into a veritable hedgehog.</p><p>“Bang, bang, bang…”</p><p>Countless blue crystal arrows rained down like a storm.  The energy shield violently trembled. Qin Sang’s true energy drained rapidly, like a bursting dam.</p><p>Despite the onslaught, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.  As he expected, the blue crystal arrows were limited in power.  Such a hidden array would necessarily sacrifice some power; otherwise, the complexity of the array would betray its presence to those skilled in breaking them.</p><p>The array's strength lay in its surprise attack.  An unwary, unprepared array breaker would have been riddled with arrows.</p><p>But as this thought crossed his mind, the Tianmu Butterfly sounded an alarm. Qin Sang felt a violent surge of energy from below, jolting him.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted instantly, leaping high, and cleaving downwards with his sword.  The Snow-Treading Divine Sword met the threat; the blade’s energy surged like lightning.</p><p>The ice abruptly exploded, emitting a blinding blue light.  A massive, several-meter-wide column of blue light burst forth, containing energy accumulated for who knew how long.  It was a far more potent attack than the crystal arrows.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang’s vigilance hadn't faltered; he deflected the blow with his sword.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>With the clang of the sword, the blue light column’s advance stopped. At the column’s peak, a divine sword hung suspended in mid-air, its blade slightly slanted, as if a god descended, its energy cascading downwards.</p><p>Immediately, the Xuan Qi hand seized the opportunity, following closely behind, its five fingers outstretched to envelop the pillar of light.</p><p>Qin Sang, without looking down, his figure flashing repeatedly, finally arrived at the edge of the light column before the  Snow-Trampling Divine Blade and the Xuan Qi hand collapsed.</p><p>While Qin Sang was dodging with all his might,</p><p>Yue Fei and Yan Shan Lao Ren were also impacted on the other side.</p><p>They were located on the outer periphery of the ice cave.  The number of blue crystal arrows, and the power of the final light column, were both weaker than what Qin Sang encountered.</p><p>However, the two were caught in a fierce battle when the catastrophe struck, making their danger no less than, if not greater than, Qin Sang's.</p><p>Yue Fei had consistently held the initiative.</p><p>As the blue crystal arrows shot forth, a silver light flickered around her. Beneath her clothes was a suit of inner armor, incredibly form-fitting, thin as a cicada's wing, and not hindering her figure at all.</p><p>The inner armor transformed into a phantom suit of armor, completely enveloping Yue Fei, as sturdy as the Ruyi Treasure Orb's protective barrier, blocking all the blue crystal arrows.</p><p>However, facing the ensuing blue light column, Yue Fei's response wasn't as calm as Qin Sang's.</p><p>In a moment of crisis, she actually threw away her inner armor, using it to defend against the blue light column, sacrificing the treasure to momentarily impede the column.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren was a step slower.</p><p>To make matters worse, his two most relied-upon defensive treasures were not at hand.</p><p>The Dragon Head Shield was entangled by the silver bracelets.</p><p>The Primal Yuan Heavy Water, used to restrain Yue Fei, couldn't be retrieved in time.</p><p>In haste, Yan Shan Lao Ren could only retrieve a thin rope, completing a spell. The rope encircled his body, transforming into a protective ring of water.</p><p>“Plop plop plop…”</p><p>This, however, was not a defensive treasure. Water splashed from the ring, becoming increasingly thin.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren gritted his teeth, desperately recalling the Dragon Head Shield.</p><p>Fortunately, Yue Fei was preoccupied and unable to control the silver bracelets at that moment.</p><p>With a “bang,” the blood ring on the Dragon Head Shield shattered, reverting to two silver bracelets. The Dragon Head Shield shot back. Yan Shan Lao Ren had just raised his shield to block the blue crystal arrows and didn't have time to adjust before being engulfed by the blue light column!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The light column grazed the protective barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang only felt a flash of brilliant blue light before being knocked away by a powerful force. His protective barrier creaked. Thankfully, he reacted in time, the barrier only being grazed, not shattered, and he remained unharmed.</p><p>A dizzying sensation swept over him.</p><p>With a “bang,” Qin Sang crashed into the stone wall.</p><p>By this time, the killing array was at its end, the blue crystal arrows exhausted, but the chaos in the ice cave was only just beginning.</p><p>Three strikingly blue light columns were conspicuous, their energy dissipating outwards, forming waves of blue energy that impacted everything within the ice cave.</p><p>A chill ran through his palm.</p><p>Having obtained the Cold Crystal, Qin Sang hadn't had time to examine it closely. He hurriedly looked towards where Yan Shan Lao Ren was.</p><p>At the last moment, he saw Yan Shan Lao Ren engulfed by the light column. The column's energy continued to erupt, the blue light forming a massive tide, the energy within it utterly chaotic.</p><p>Having made an agreement with Yan Shan Lao Ren to obtain the treasure, he couldn't abandon him to his fate.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly put away the Cold Crystal and dashed towards the light column.</p><p>Unexpectedly, halfway there, a figure intercepted him, Yue Fei.</p><p>Without a word, Yue Fei manipulated the Thunder Pearl, forming a net of lightning to block Qin Sang's path.</p><p>“Get out of my way!”</p><p>Qin Sang roared in anger, slashing with his blade.</p><p>The blade qi carved a path through the snow.</p><p>Everywhere around, the cold blue light raged. This was a kingdom of ice and snow.</p><p>Both having cultivated the Ice Dao, in this environment, they were truly a match made in heaven.</p><p>Yue Fei had already experienced the sharpness of the Snow-Trampling Divine Blade. With a cold snort, she threw out two objects, the split silver bracelets, somehow retrieved.</p><p>A familiar scene replayed.</p><p>The bracelets transformed into blood worms, seizing the opportunity while the blade qi was obstructed by the lightning net, attacking the Snow-Trampling Divine Blade from both sides.</p><p>Qin Sang completely ignored the divine blade.</p><p>White vapor rose from his head.  A new Xuan Qi hand, tens of times smaller than the one that had seized the light column, appeared, its power undiminished. Five fingers clawed, striking towards Yue Fei's throat.</p><p>Yue Fei was indeed formidable, still possessing untapped abilities. She slightly opened her mouth, her breath forming a jade screen.</p><p>However, before the screen materialized, it was struck by a lightning thread shot from Qin Sang's dantian and vanished instantly.</p><p>Her divine ability broken,</p><p>Yue Fei still refused to yield, shifting her body slightly, her fair shoulder gracefully tilted, a butterfly tattoo adorning her shoulder, exquisite needlework bringing it to life.</p><p>The butterfly flapped its wings, actually flying, its wings extending wide, like a shield, narrowly protecting Yue Fei's vital point.</p><p>Though intercepted, the Xuan Qi hand's force was not easily stopped.</p><p>The butterfly tattoo was a one-time use.</p><p>Yue Fei groaned, the butterfly dissipating as she was thrown back.  Her right shoulder's clothes were torn, and blood flowed freely.</p><p>Blood also spilled from the corner of her mouth, staining her red lips, yet her smile grew even more alluring. Ignoring her injuries, she turned and charged again.</p><p>“This she-devil is insane!”</p><p>Qin Sang never expected Yue Fei to stop him at the cost of her life.  Even if she killed Yan Shan Lao Ren, what was the point?  The she-devil was severely injured and no match for him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't understand, immediately summoning his spiritual treasure!</p>
