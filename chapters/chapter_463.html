Chapter 456: Star Origin Stones


After Ji Wu arrived, two more figures descended.


At that time, including Qin Sang, there were thirty-three people on Stargazing Island, encompassing all the top-tier Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Turbulent Islands waters.


These individuals mostly hailed from various sects in the Xiaohan Region. The remaining few independent cultivators also had some connection to Yinshan Pass.


They were all human cultivators, with no demon cultivators from the Heavenly Demon Mound.


During the three-year standoff, there were no demon cultivators sighted.


At most, some cultivators' spirit beasts were seen, mostly from the Imperial Spirit Sect.  One such cultivator, Mu Zhige, was present; his spirit beast was a golden eagle, supposedly a descendant of a Heavenly Demon Mound demon king.


As for the power struggles between the various forces in the Xiaohan Region, Qin Sang remained unaware.


When the last person arrived, the great hall's stone door suddenly opened by itself.


Everyone stopped their idle chatter, exchanged glances, and entered in small groups.


The floor was paved with gold bricks, and luminous pearls shone brightly.


Within the resplendent golden hall, there were only a few majestic dragon pillars; there were no other furnishings.


Two people stood in the golden hall.


It was the Snake Madam and Deputy Island Master Xiao!


Such a scene was uncommon.


Upon recognizing the two island masters' identities, everyone was secretly surprised, their faces showing respectful expressions, and their demeanor became more cautious.


"Greetings to both Island Masters!"


The Snake Madam approached, leaning on her snake staff. Her face was aged, her triangular eyes emitting a slightly cold gaze, similar to the snake-bodied man.


Feeling the Snake Madam's gaze sweep over her, although knowing the other woman wouldn't hold malice or pay attention to someone of her low status, Qin Sang still felt a tightening in her chest.


"All of you are outstanding heroes who emerged from the recent great war, each with illustrious achievements…"


For the first time ever, they heard praise from a Golden Core cultivator, and from the Island Master of Stargazing Island, no less.


The crowd looked at each other in astonishment.


Some secretly rejoiced, speculating about potential rewards.


The Snake Madam's speech wasn't fast, but everyone was patient, with no one showing impatience.


"...There is a task that needs to be done."


The Snake Madam's tone was unquestionable.  She paused slightly, then looked deeply at Qin Sang and the others.


"Please instruct us, Island Master!"


Qin Sang and the others bowed without hesitation to receive their orders.


No reward, but a new mission.


While disappointed, they couldn't help but feel apprehensive. The two island masters' presence, summoning all the renowned experts, meant the task wouldn't be simple; there might be great danger.


But their actions were swift and orderly. Years of warfare had trained them to obey orders.


Especially those given by the Snake Madam and Deputy Island Master Xiao—who would dare to object?


Seeing this, the Snake Madam nodded in satisfaction.


Mu Zhige of the Imperial Spirit Sect, being bold, asked, "May I ask, Island Master, is it only us? Or everyone in the squads...?"


"Only you."


The Snake Madam glanced around, seeming to see through their thoughts. She let out a chuckle of ambiguous meaning. "This journey does indeed involve danger. However, for some of you, it might be a chance encounter."


Hearing this, the crowd's eyes lit up, their faces filled with anticipation as they looked at the Snake Madam.


Unexpectedly, the Snake Madam's tone changed.  "Many of you should know of the existence of the Pointing to Heaven Peak.  Its location is beneath the beam of light from last night's battle, sealed by a restriction. Once the restriction is lifted, you will need to go in and collect a peculiar object called a Star Origin Stone."


"Star Origin Stone!"


Before the Snake Madam finished speaking, someone suddenly exclaimed, disregarding their status, eagerly asking, "Senior, the one you mentioned... is it that rare treasure, the Star Origin Stone, born from the power of the stars, capable of harnessing the power of the celestial stars, a treasure seldom found in this world?"


Everyone looked towards the source of the voice, to see that it was a Yuan Shen Gate disciple, known as Jiu Zhenzi.


These people knew each other to some extent.  Jiu Zhenzi was known for his cold and aloof temperament. Even on the battlefield, he had never been this agitated.


Jiu Zhenzi's face was filled with shock, as if the Star Origin Stone were something extraordinary.


Qin Sang carefully recalled, confirming that she had never heard of the Star Origin Stone.


The Snake Madam frowned, coldly glancing at Jiu Zhenzi.  "Could there be a second type of Star Origin Stone in the world?"


"Forgive my transgression, Island Master."


Jiu Zhenzi quickly apologized, looking around and cleverly explained for the Snake Madam.


"Fellow Daoists who are not well-versed in Spirit Arrays might not be familiar with Star Origin Stones.


"There's a type of Spirit Array that can draw down the power of the celestial stars, extremely powerful. The Star Origin Stone is essential for setting up this kind of array.


"Nowadays, such arrays are almost extinct, impossible to create, precisely because of the lack of Star Origin Stones.


"In ancient times, there were legends of those who plucked stars and moved moons. Legends say that some created Star Origin Stones, but this method has long been lost."


I only learned about the legend of the Starstone from my master. I thought it was a myth.  I never expected the Starstone to still exist, let alone in Finger Heaven Peak. The shock was overwhelming, hence my outburst…"

Arrangement artifact?

Qin Sang was startled.

He had assumed Finger Heaven Peak held some rare herbs or magical elixirs.  The Tianxing Alliance and the Xiao Han region went to such lengths, even attracting a Yuan Ying expert, all for a Starstone.  He wondered what grand formation they intended to build.

"As expected of a disciple of the Yuan Shen Sect, you know the secret of the Starstone… Your sect must have quite a collection of ancient arrays."

The Serpent Witch narrowed her eyes, glancing at Jiu Zhenzi.

Jiu Zhenzi's heart pounded. He quickly bowed. "Island Master, forgive me. My cultivation is low, I haven't the clearance to know my sect's secrets, and I don't know if we possess any ancient arrays."

The Serpent Witch coldly snorted, letting Jiu Zhenzi off the hook.

Jiu Zhenzi secretly breathed a sigh of relief, realizing his back was drenched in cold sweat.

"These artifacts are called Soul-locking Bracelets. Take these."

The Serpent Witch produced a large handful of silver bracelets, tossing them to Qin Sang and the others. "These Soul-locking Bracelets are extremely difficult to refine. You'll need them to obtain the Starstone.  Do not damage them; otherwise, you'll return empty-handed."

Qin Sang caught a Soul-locking Bracelet and examined it closely.

It was an artifact beyond simple ranking; such artifacts have unique purposes, not for combat, and the Soul-locking Bracelet was no exception.  It was a slender silver bracelet with a tiny gemstone embedded in it. Qin Sang spent a while trying to identify the material.

The gemstone was flawless, radiating a clear light, like a star descended to earth.

It looked like a beautiful ornament.

One worried that the slightest pressure would break it.

After carefully listening to the Serpent Witch's instructions on how to use the Soul-locking Bracelet, Qin Sang carefully stored it in his dimensional pouch.  However, his mind was already focused on the Serpent Witch's promised reward.
