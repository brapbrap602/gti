Chapter Ninety-Nine: A Ruthless Person

After Qin Sang sat down, Yu Lian bowed slightly and said, "Earlier, Youniang mentioned that Fellow Daoist Qin had something to ask. If there's anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to speak."

"It's not urgent," Qin Sang smiled. "I just overheard Senior Yu talking about major events in the cultivation world, and my curiosity was piqued. I didn't dare interrupt your conversation, so I thought I'd wait until you finished."

Hearing this, the others nodded repeatedly, a few of them smiling kindly at Qin Sang.

Li Youniang brought over several warm cups of wine, offered one to Qin Sang, and sat down beside him.

Yu Lian took a sip of wine and praised, "Youniang's skills are getting better and better! Since Fellow Daoist Han also wants to hear, I'll tell you all about it... The biggest event in the cultivation world recently has to be the sudden attack by the Demonic Sect, the Kuiyin Sect, on the Righteous Sect, the Yuanzhao Sect, a few months ago. Several Golden Core masters fought a series of battles, turning the world dark and shaking the very mountains and rivers. In the end, the Kuiyin Sect was completely annihilated."

Qin Sang, who had been staring at the amber liquid in his wine cup, looked up in astonishment.

The others also began to clamor, "Old man, are you messing with us? How did the Kuiyin Sect end up being annihilated after attacking the Yuanzhao Sect? What happened to the Yuanzhao Sect? And what is the Kuiyin Sect anyway?"

Yu Lian chuckled, "Don't be impatient, don't be impatient. Let me tell you slowly. To understand the reason for this battle, we have to talk about the origins of the Kuiyin Sect and the Yuanzhao Sect. I'm sure some of you have heard of them, but you may not know the full story. Take the Yuanzhao Sect, for example. Although it's declining now, several hundred years ago, its reputation was no less than that of the eight most prestigious Righteous Sects in the Small Cold Region today! The Kuiyin Sect was also an existence comparable to the Yuanzhao Sect."

"The founder of the Yuanzhao Sect was the Nascent Soul ancestor, Yuanzhao. The Kuiyin Sect was founded by a Nascent Soul demonic cultivator, Kuiyin. Both of them were influential figures back then, and the two sects were established almost at the same time. Even the names of the sects are derived from their founders. Isn't that a coincidence? What's even more coincidental is that the two sects are not far from each other, natural rivals, destined to clash. There was bad blood between them from the start."

"Back then, Ancestor Yuanzhao and several of his disciples died unexpectedly in an ancient battlefield. If the Wuji Sect hadn't intervened, Kuiyin would have bullied the weaker sect and wiped out Yuanzhao Peak. It wasn't until Kuiyin passed away that the conflict subsided. Unexpectedly, the Kuiyin Sect never forgot their old grudge and launched an all-out attack on the Yuanzhao Sect, only to be destroyed themselves."

Having said this, Yu Lian took another sip of wine, closed his eyes, and savored it leisurely.

The captivated audience suddenly turned hostile, denouncing Yu Lian.

"You old ghost, always leaving us hanging!"

"That's right, so frustrating!"

...

Qin Sang was also anxious, wishing he could pry open Yu Lian's head to see what was inside. If the Kuiyin Sect was truly annihilated, he wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore, and that mysterious orchid would be his!

Yu Lian, however, looked smug and laughed heartily, "Wouldn't it be too boring if I didn't keep you in suspense?"

After another wave of protests, Yu Lian continued with a chuckle, "This matter has been discussed even within my clan. What's puzzling is why the Kuiyin Sect dared to attack the Yuanzhao Sect. Their protective formation is not to be trifled with. It was set up by Ancestor Yuanzhao and two of his Nascent Soul friends, one of whom was from the Yuan Mirage Sect. It's not something a few Golden Core cultivators can break. What's even stranger is that the formation seems to have been broken!"

"Broken?"

The crowd was surprised. "The protective formation was broken, yet it was the Kuiyin Sect that was annihilated?"

Yu Lian shook his head, "Rumors are flying everywhere, and I wasn't there, so I'm not sure which are true and which are false. Only one piece of news is likely true, as it originated from the Wuji Sect. It is said that on that night, demonic flames filled the sky, and the Kuiyin Sect's attack was fierce, forcing the Yuanzhao Sect's Grand Elder to detonate his Golden Core, taking the protective formation and the sect's spiritual veins with him. The terrifying power instantly killed one of the Kuiyin Sect's Golden Core masters, severely injured two others, and caused countless casualties among their Foundation Establishment cultivators. If the situation hadn't been so dire, why would the Grand Elder resort to such a drastic measure?"

The crowd exclaimed, "Detonated his Golden Core!"

Golden Core masters were beings they could only look up to. It was difficult to imagine the terrifying scene of a Golden Core master self-destructing.


Qin Sang was somewhat lost in thought. The horrifying sight of the Great Sun's eruption that night had given him a vague suspicion, but now, with confirmation, he was deeply shaken. He couldn't help but murmur, "How ruthless..."

The Golden Core, the Sect-Protecting Formation, and the Yuanzhao Peak's spiritual veinâ€”all detonated together. That Grand Elder was truly decisive.

"Indeed, a ruthless man!" Yu Lian sighed with emotion. "His self-destruction, seemingly a pyrrhic victory, preserved his own sect's lineage and severed the roots of his sworn enemy. No wonder he was able to cultivate to the Golden Core stage and become the Grand Elder."

A young man scoffed, "That's because he had a Nascent Soul master as his teacher.  Given the same cultivation resources, our achievements would certainly be no less than his!"

Yu Lian chuckled and nodded, then shifted the conversation back. "I imagine the three Golden Cores of the Kuiyin Sect didn't expect the Yuanzhao Sect's Grand Elder to be so resolute.  One died on the spot, two were severely injured, and they were immediately scared witless, fleeing in panic.  Pursued by another Golden Core master of the Yuanzhao Sect, one more was slain, while the other hid within the Kuiyin Sect, refusing to come out. Later, reinforcements from the Wuji Sect arrived and surrounded the Kuiyin Sect, only to find it abandoned.  The survivor reportedly fled into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. The Kuiyin Sect is now occupied by the Yuanzhao Sect, a true loss on all fronts."

Qin Sang suddenly asked, "Which Golden Core elder of the Kuiyin Sect survived?"  

His heart pounded with anxiety, but his face remained impassive.

Yu Lian frowned. "I'm not sure. The news released by the Wuji Sect only stated that the Kuiyin Sect's leader's misdeeds led to his own demise.  It's assumed this devil is dead.  The other two weren't well-known, so I don't know which one managed to survive. Considering that Kuiyin elder was a notorious fiend, it's surprising that his lineage was severed after only so many years. I wonder what the Kuiyin Sect's leader was thinking. It's said he was already five hundred years old, nearing his natural end, yet he suddenly pulled this stunt, not only losing his own life but also destroying his ancestral foundation."

Qin Sang lowered his head in thought, his brow slightly furrowed. As long as even one Kuiyin Sect Golden Core remained alive, he might not be safe.

Thinking of this, Qin Sang offered a compliment. "The secrets Elder Yu has shared are truly eye-opening. I just heard Elder Yu mention the Eight Righteous Sects. I am ignorant and unfamiliar with many of them.  Could Elder Yu briefly elaborate and enlighten me?"
