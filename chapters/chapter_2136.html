<h1>Chapter 2126: Nine Heavens Kui Gang Yellow Dragon Seizes Life</h1><p>The heavens trembled with thunder, resounding through the void.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, the thunder drowned out all other sounds.</p><p>On the battlefield, friend and foe alike, all cultivators felt their hearts tremble, instinctively looking towards the formation's core.</p><p>Some cultivators engaged in fierce combat saw their exchanges slow down.</p><p>Now, the situation was clear. One side sought to break the formation's core, the other to protect it. The outcome of this clash would determine the course of the battle.</p><p>The Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock possessed extraordinary might. Accompanied by the clicking of its clasps, a faint golden radiance emerged on the battlefield. Wherever the golden light touched, all disturbances were quelled, and a strange calm pervaded the void.</p><p>The lightning dimmed, or perhaps it was more accurate to say that the golden radiance was even more brilliant, obscuring the lightning's glow.</p><p>In the nine heavens above, thunderbolts hung like silver chains on the horizon, frozen in this moment, neither disappearing nor giving birth to new ones. The Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal hung in mid-air, surrounded by flickering golden light, seemingly also imprisoned.</p><p>In the Grand Protector's hands, the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock displayed astonishing power. It lacked the overwhelming momentum of Qin Sang's thunder techniques, but its tranquility was equally awe-inspiring.</p><p>Some in Lu Wang's army rejoiced at the sight of such a treasure on their side. However, their joy was short-lived. With a booming thunderclap, the golden radiance surrounding the Thunder Seal violently shook, and countless cracks burst forth.</p><p>'Clang! Clang! Clang!'</p><p>The Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock trembled violently, ringing loudly.</p><p>Cracks spread through the void at an alarming rate, as if heaven and earth, reflected in a bronze mirror, were shattering into pieces!</p><p>Countless fragments of golden light danced in the air, and along with them, the joy on the faces of Lu Wang's cultivators crumbled.</p><p>The Grand Protector's expression changed abruptly. He had underestimated Qin Sang once again!</p><p>Previously, according to Lu Gan's report, Qin Sang had merely used a secret technique to escape the Golden Lock Domain and did not possess the strength to confront the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock directly.</p><p>Yet here and now, Qin Sang had clearly broken the Golden Lock Domain of the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock with a single thunder technique!</p><p>The Grand Protector had been wary of Xia Changshi intervening secretly, never expecting Qin Sang to be hiding such depths. Caught off guard, he reacted hastily, and the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock's power wasn't fully unleashed. But for Qin Sang to achieve this feat, it was enough to prove his strength!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Azure lightning descended from the sky, piercing the void, passing through the fragments of golden light with unstoppable force.</p><p>Within the formation's core, Min Zhuo's face was filled with shock. The situation had shifted dramatically, each twist beyond expectation. When the Grand Protector had brought out the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock, he had almost believed he was saved, already contemplating how to feign an injury.</p><p>This Thunder Seal was too terrifying. Locked onto by it, Min Zhuo felt his entire body's vital essence solidify.</p><p>With his cultivation, at this moment, employing any spirit treasures or divine abilities would likely be futile. He could only place his hopes on Lu Gan and the Grand Protector!</p><p>He had volunteered to oversee the formation's core to seek an opportunity to escape, but he never imagined the enemy's strength to be so formidable.  Shortly after the battle began, he was already facing the threat of death.</p><p>Among so many powerful figures, they could still pinpoint and strike at the enemy commander!</p><p>If given another chance, he would surely think twice before making such a decision.</p><p>The thunderous might arrived in an instant. At the last moment, flowing water surrounded Min Zhuo, transforming into a surging river, swirling around him.</p><p>The river water was azure blue, and upon closer inspection, countless points of light floated within, like fluorescent jellyfish, drifting along the current.</p><p>From afar, the river twisted and turned around Min Zhuo, transforming into limbs, a torso, and a head, taking the form of a towering giant.</p><p>Min Zhuo desperately tried to save himself, but he knew deep down that whether or not he could escape this calamity depended not on himself.</p><p>At this critical juncture, a mysterious yellow light finally emerged around Min Zhuo, enveloping him in a strange power.</p><p>The Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability was activated!</p><p>Min Zhuo was located within the heart of the water giant. As the mysterious yellow light appeared, his figure immediately became illusory, on the verge of being sucked into a vortex.</p><p>Just then, a dragon's roar suddenly echoed from above, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p>Min Zhuo's internal vital essence churned, and his mind reeled. He discovered that a colossal being had appeared in the sky, its shadow blanketing the earth!</p><p>Only a portion of its outline was visible, resembling a mass of yellow clouds.</p><p>The clouds formed a dragon shape, its color pale yellow, with scales, claws, tail, head, and horns all vividly depicted. The Azure Dragon coiled in the celestial pole; the mere glimpse of its scales and claws was enough to astound the world.</p><p>Its body resided in the nine heavens, its head lowered, overlooking the formation's core, eyes wide with fury. The roar had emanated from its mouth.</p><p>A Tier 3 Thunder Talisman of the Dao Court — Nine Heavens Kui Gang Yellow Dragon Seizes Life!</p><p>In ancient times, the image of the Thunder God took many forms, one of which was the Yellow Dragon. Another theory held that the Yellow Dragon referred to the legendary divine beast, the Yinglong, also known as the god of thunder and rain.</p><p>The enemy was seeking a way to counter him, and Qin Sang was no exception. This talisman was meant to break that mysterious yellow light!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The dragon roared, shaking the heavens.</p><p>Boundless might erupted. Following the activation of the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock, the battlefield fell silent once more.</p><p>The cultivators seemed to sense the legendary dragon's might, while Min Zhuo faced the brunt of its impact.</p><p>The dragon's head nearly filled Min Zhuo's vision, delivering a tremendous shock. He watched in horror as the mysterious yellow light froze under the roar, and then ripples spread through the vortex formed by the mysterious yellow light.</p><p>The Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability.</p><p>Lu Gan, seated in meditation above the clear pool, now stirred slightly, a grave expression flitting across his face.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>He formed a seal with one hand and pressed it downwards.</p><p>Within the clear pool, a point of yellow light appeared, manifesting as a golden carp. The carp seemed burdened by immense pressure, shaking its head and tail, struggling to surface. With a powerful flick of its tail...</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>A spray of water erupted.</p><p>At the same time, the vortex of mysterious yellow light beneath Min Zhuo surged again, waves of light rising to meet the Yellow Dragon. Alas, they ultimately failed to reverse the tide. The light waves shattered under the roar, and the vortex of mysterious yellow light trembled violently, collapsing!</p><p>Min Zhuo's figure solidified, remaining in place, as he felt the terrifying thunderous might descend.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Azure lightning descended from the heavens, striking the giant directly on the crown of its head.</p><p>The water flow composing the giant abruptly ceased. Lightning could be seen coursing through its entire body.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>From head to limbs, the giant's body exploded, like a massive splash of water bursting in mid-air.</p><p>Within the curtain of water, Min Zhuo stood alone, all the thunder and lightning converging upon him.</p><p>At this moment, Min Zhuo was nearly driven to despair.</p><p>He possessed a treasure that automatically protected its owner, a jade pendant worn on his chest. The pendant flickered, emitting a dazzling glow, but quickly dimmed amidst the lightning.</p><p>Lu Wang's army watched helplessly as Min Zhuo was swallowed by the thunder. Those Void Realm Second Stage experts, including the Grand Protector, attempted to rescue him but were a step too late.</p><p>The only one who could save him was Lu Gan, controlling the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability!</p><p>Sensing that the mysterious yellow light had been broken, Lu Gan's face paled drastically. Without hesitation, he poured all his power into the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability.</p><p>Underground, the true master of the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability, Shao Shi, seemed to be in deep meditation. He sensed something, his eyelids twitching, but made no other reaction.</p><p>Within the region enveloped by the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability, a clear pool appeared in each of the eight directions.</p><p>Some appeared on mountain peaks, some in valleys, some at the bends of rivers…</p><p>These springs emerged out of thin air, seemingly out of place, yet they blended perfectly with their surroundings, as if they had always been there, the eight spiritual eyes of the earth.</p><p>Including the one beneath Lu Gan, there were nine clear pools in total. Upon their appearance, they radiated extraordinary fluctuations, emitting a peculiar power.</p><p>Meanwhile, above Min Zhuo's head, a streak of mysterious yellow light emerged from the void. This streak was deeper and richer than before, suddenly spreading outwards.</p><p>Then, the image of a scroll appeared within the mysterious yellow light. The scroll unfurled, revealing chaos within, its contents indiscernible.</p><p>The scroll targeted the formation's core and suddenly rolled up, engulfing Min Zhuo. A mysterious yellow scroll remained in his place, while Min Zhuo vanished without a trace.</p><p>In the moment before Min Zhuo disappeared, his chest pendant could be seen shattering, engulfed by thunder, blood spraying from his mouth. He was certainly gravely injured, but likely not dead, rescued by the mysterious yellow scroll.</p><p>The mysterious yellow scroll then flashed thousands of zhang away, transforming into a streak of yellow light, moving in an unpredictable manner. After a few flickers, it vanished, the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal and the Yellow Dragon unable to stop or destroy it.</p><p>At this point, after the Golden Lock Domain was broken, the Grand Protector summoned a treasure vase and came to intercept.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had already ceased his attack. He didn't even glance at the escaping mysterious yellow scroll, instead fixing his deep gaze on the horizon. His gaze was almost tangible, piercing through towering mountains and vast ridges, landing upon Lu Gan above the clear pool.</p><p>Despite the vast distance, Lu Gan's heart skipped a beat. He felt both shock and anger. With a wave of his hand, clouds and mist rose from the earth, obstructing Qin Sang's line of sight.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly withdrew his gaze. Though he hadn't managed to kill Min Zhuo, his objective was achieved. He finally knew what kind of treasure Lu Wang's army relied upon!</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt a slight stinging sensation in his brow. He turned his gaze towards the edge of the battlefield, seeing the Grand Protector hovering in mid-air, holding the treasure vase, staring coldly at him, but not launching another attack.</p><p>After their brief clash, the two once again faced off across the distance, while the battlefield had descended into chaos.</p><p>With Min Zhuo's escape, the formation collapsed without anyone overseeing its core. The morale of Lu Wang's army plummeted, suffering heavy casualties in an instant. Seeing this, the powerful cultivators quickly disengaged from Si Lu and the others, helping Li Yue break out of the sword formation and regroup their forces. Leaving behind countless corpses, they hastily retreated from the battlefield.</p><p>…</p><p>Before Lu Wang's carriage.</p><p>Looking at the retreating army, Lu Wang's expression was grim, the atmosphere heavy with suppression.</p><p>They had anticipated the enemy might be concealing their true strength, but even with preparations, they were still driven back in such disarray. The powerful cultivators felt a sense of shame, especially Li Yue, the commander, who had been trapped in the sword formation throughout the battle, practically useless.</p><p>"How are Clan Leader Min Zhuo's injuries?"</p><p>Lu Wang spoke, concerned about Min Zhuo's condition.</p><p>A streak of yellow light flew from the sky, landing on the ground, revealing two figures: the Grand Protector and Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo's face was ashen, his body covered in injuries, with lingering thunder marks on his neck. The thunder marks were still writhing, the power of thunder wreaking havoc within his body, indicating that his injuries were more severe than they appeared.</p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p>Upon landing, Min Zhuo stumbled, his complexion worsening.</p><p>"Clan Leader!"</p><p>Cries of alarm arose from the army, and several Chang You Tribe experts rushed to Min Zhuo's side, attempting to support him.</p><p>Though disgruntled, they dared not show it.</p><p>Min Zhuo waved them away, saying, "Thank you for your concern, Lu Wang. I am ashamed! Thanks to the Grand Protector's miraculous pills, my injuries have been stabilized. However, due to my weakened state, the thunder poison within me needs to be purged slowly..."</p><p>Lu Wang's expression eased slightly. "It is good that Clan Leader Min Zhuo is alright. We underestimated that Qin Zhenren. Fortunately, Clan Leader Min Zhuo is blessed with good fortune and was able to escape this disaster!"</p><p>"Lu Wang flatters me. Without your and the Grand Protector's meticulous planning, as well as Master Shao Shi and Fellow Daoist Lu Gan controlling the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability, I would have been reduced to ashes. That Qin Zhenren hid his strength so deeply. Thinking back now, I still feel a lingering fear, and my resolve to eliminate those outsiders is even stronger!"</p><p>Min Zhuo displayed a fitting expression of shock and anger, then shifted his tone. "Unfortunately, my essence has been injured in this battle. The pills can only delay the eruption of my injuries. Only at the Sacred Lake can I hope to recover. I must return to the Sacred Lake for treatment as soon as possible and may not be able to witness Lu Wang's grand victory personally."</p><p>"Is Clan Leader Min Zhuo afraid that I will withdraw my troops?"</p><p>Lu Wang laughed heartily. "I have come with great fanfare. Even if Xia Changshi were still alive, I would not retreat. No matter how strong that Qin Zhenren is, he is only at the Mid Void Refinement Stage. You may rest assured and focus on your recovery."</p><p>Observing Lu Wang and the others, Min Zhuo saw that they indeed harbored no suspicions. He lowered his eyes. "In that case, I will await Lu Wang's good news at the Sacred Lake!"</p><p>Afterwards, Min Zhuo entered Lu Wang's carriage with the others, recounted the events of the battle and his speculations, and formally requested leave from Lu Wang.</p><p>Several Chang You Tribe experts escorted Min Zhuo as he flew out of the Western Lands, continuing outwards, leaving the range of the Eight Extremes Diagram of Instability. Min Zhuo proceeded cautiously, circling for a long time, ensuring there were no threats before finally heading towards the Sacred Cleansing Plains.</p><p>Looking at the vast blue waves and clear sky, Min Zhuo let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Recalling the previous events, he still felt lingering fear.</p><p>But he had gambled correctly!</p><p>It wasn't trust in Lu Wang and the Grand Protector's character, but rather the belief that if they had any hidden means, they wouldn't abandon him in front of everyone. Otherwise, once exposed, who would serve them?</p><p>And that Qin Zhenren…</p><p>Previously, Min Zhuo had lamented becoming a pawn, but now he felt fortunate. Without Lu Wang and the others, he would have no chance of competing with the Tempest Realm for Mount Daiyu.</p><p>Now, he had gambled with his life and won a glimmer of hope!</p>
