<h1>Chapter 1773: City Within the Pot</h1><p>After learning about Tao Hengshan's offer, Qin Sang didn't immediately reply, saying he needed time to consider.</p><p>Realman Tao expressed his understanding, acknowledging that choosing a cultivation method is the most solemn decision in a cultivator's life, and no amount of caution is excessive.</p><p>Leaving the lecture hall, the two returned to the main hall. Realman Tao then sweetened the deal, adding more incentives.</p><p>After staying in the mountains for several days, Qin Sang expressed his intention to leave.  Realman Tao, unable to persuade him to stay, personally escorted him out of the mountains.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's receding figure, Realman Tao knew that the hope of recruiting him was slim, and couldn't help but shake his head and sigh softly.</p><p>Leaving Tao Hengshan, Qin Sang returned directly to Yunfeng City without stopping, and then took a Teleportation Formation north.</p><p>After several transfers, he finally arrived at an Immortal City built on the water, called Youdai Pass.</p><p>Stone pillars, each carved with protective runes, plunged into the water's depths, rising hundreds of zhang above the surface. Streets and houses were built between the pillars, forming the Immortal City. These pillars also served as the foundation for the city's defensive formations, a testament to its ingenious design.</p><p>Qin Sang walked along the streets, gazing down at the river's surface, paying particular attention to the stone pillars.</p><p>After a short while, he raised his head.</p><p>This Immortal City had no walls. Standing at its edge, Qin Sang could see the outside world at a glance.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, a jade-ribbon-like river stretched out, its broad surface shimmering with sparkling waves. The mighty river flowed from the southwest, passing beneath the Immortal City.</p><p>This river was the Sanyuan River that flowed at the foot of the Xuangji Sect's mountain.</p><p>This river flowed through Baishi Prefecture, absorbing countless tributaries before finally merging into the Star Island Immortal Lake from its western side. The confluence of the river and lake was only a dozen li from this Immortal City.</p><p>It was said that there was another river, comparable in size to the Sanyuan River, on the eastern side of the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>The Star Island Immortal Lake was immensely vast, with countless rivers flowing into it. These two rivers were the most magnificent, like two ribbons adorning the lake.</p><p>This Immortal City was situated right at the juncture of the river and lake, hence the name Youdai Pass (Right Ribbon Pass). To the east, there was a corresponding Zuodai Pass (Left Ribbon Pass).</p><p>Due to their strategic locations, these two pass cities were second only to Huzhong City in fame.</p><p>Huzhong City, located in the center of the Star Island Immortal Lake, was the second largest Immortal City after Heming Mountain, and the foremost city in the hearts of the Jushan Prefecture cultivators.</p><p>This city was also one of Qin Sang's destinations.</p><p>Arriving at Youdai Pass, there were no more Teleportation Formations leading further. Qin Sang had to fly into the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>According to his understanding, it would take about ten days of flight to reach a Teleportation Formation that could transport him to the heart of the Star Island Immortal Lake, and then he would still need to fly some distance to reach Huzhong City.</p><p>The layout of the Star Island Immortal Lake seemed artificially segmented into several layers. This arrangement was likely designed to defend against external enemies, allowing for rapid isolation and layered defenses in case of emergencies.</p><p>Qin Sang left the city and followed the Sanyuan River to its mouth, admiring the beautiful scenery where the river and lake met, before summoning his escape light and entering the Immortal Lake.</p><p>The Star Island Immortal Lake was as vast as the sea, and to mortals, it was indeed a sea.</p><p>After flying for a while, Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh, "The name 'Star Island' is truly well-deserved."</p><p>He had never seen a lake or sea with such a dense collection of islands. Islands of varying sizes were scattered like stars across the vast expanse, and many of them emanated the auras of cultivators.</p><p>The atmosphere of the Star Island Immortal Lake, situated in the north, was completely different from that of Heming Mountain in the south. Here, people wore relaxed smiles, a sight rarely seen in Heming Mountain, a place filled with tension and a chilling air.</p><p>In Jushan Prefecture, finding such a peaceful and serene place was truly rare.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew.</p><p>On the lake's surface, sails dotted the horizon, and Qin Sang noticed Treasure Ships traveling back and forth.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang descended from his escape light and landed on the bow of a ship. After negotiating with the boatman, he entered the cabin.</p><p>Over a month passed.</p><p>The ship suddenly shuddered.</p><p>"Reporting to Immortal, we have arrived at Du Family Island," a respectful voice came from outside the cabin.</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked and set foot on the island. This island was similar in scale to an Immortal City and served a similar purpose. It housed a Teleportation Formation, and cultivators in the vicinity who wished to travel to the heart of the Star Island Immortal Lake had to come to Du Family Island first.</p><p>...</p><p>"Finally, almost there..."</p><p>In the heart of the Star Island Immortal Lake, Qin Sang flew slowly a hundred zhang above the water's surface.</p><p>Looking ahead, the cartographic map of the Star Island Immortal Lake flashed through Qin Sang's mind. Huzhong City was not far ahead.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang glanced towards the north.</p><p>Realman Zhijian's cultivation grounds were named Jianxin Island, located north of Huzhong City. Qin Sang decided to explore Huzhong City first, and then visit Realman Zhijian.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the water's surface. Before him was Huzhong City.</p><p>Some called Huzhong City, Huzhong Island, because the city itself was an island.</p><p>Wooden walkways extended from the shore, serving as docks for boats and also as entrances to the city.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the Immortal City. The island's terrain was uneven, with rolling hills and vast forests, but pavilions and towers could be seen on the mountains and among the trees, some densely clustered, others sparsely scattered.</p><p>Huzhong City was probably larger than Heming Mountain, Qin Sang thought to himself, as he stepped onto a wooden walkway, paid the entrance fee to the guards, and entered the Immortal City.</p><p>Upon entering the city, Qin Sang's first objective was to find the city's auction houses or trading companies.</p><p>Qin Sang easily discovered that the largest auction house in the city was owned by the Jushan Association, an interesting trading company named after 'Jushan' itself.</p><p>The Jushan Association had established its auction house on the highest peak of Huzhong City, which was also the most prosperous area.</p><p>At the very top of the highest peak, a massive nine-story wooden building stood prominently.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived in front of the wooden building, glanced upwards, and stepped inside, releasing a wisp of his aura.</p><p>"Greetings, Immortal..." A young man greeted him with a beaming smile.</p><p>Qin Sang asked directly, "When will the auction begin?"</p><p>The young man was momentarily stunned, but his smile remained unchanged. "Immortal, you've arrived at just the right time. There happens to be an auction about to start, but..."</p><p>Before the young man could finish, Qin Sang said, "Lead the way."</p><p>The young man, aware that some cultivators had eccentric temperaments, dared not delay. He bowed and led the way, quickly explaining the rules of the auction to Qin Sang.</p><p>In his heart, however, he was apprehensive. The aura revealed by the other party suggested he was likely a Nascent Soul Realman, while this auction was for the Soul Formation realm, and might not catch the Realman's eye.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't change his mind, however. He followed the young man into a hall on the third floor and found a seat in the back.</p><p>Soon, the hall was filled with cultivators. Qin Sang glanced around and found that most were Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>A short while later, a middle-aged man stepped onto the stage.</p><p>The following procedures were similar to the auctions he had experienced before, but Qin Sang remained interested, watching as one unfamiliar treasure after another was auctioned off.</p><p>"Yuliu Brocade, with unique properties, can be used to forge Golden Seals for various cultivation methods.  The fame of this treasure surely precedes it. Fellow Daoists whose methods are compatible, don't miss this opportunity. The starting price is five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones..." The middle-aged man's voice was impassioned as he dramatically unveiled the red silk covering the jade plate, revealing a goose-yellow brocade-like treasure, as smooth as water.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang leaned forward slightly, carefully examining the Yuliu Brocade.</p><p>The cultivators of this realm also used spirit stones for transactions, and they could use them normally.</p><p>The Yuliu Brocade had the highest starting price so far, and Qin Sang could guess why. In this realm, spiritual objects that could be used to forge altars and ensure their stability were the most sought after.</p><p>As soon as this item appeared, many cultivators' eyes lit up with fervent desire.</p><p>"Five hundred and fifty thousand!"</p><p>"Six hundred thousand!"</p><p>...</p><p>The price quickly climbed to a staggering height. The winning bidder was overjoyed, yet also felt the pinch.</p><p>Qin Sang watched for a while longer, gaining a general understanding, before getting up and walking out.</p><p>The young man had been waiting outside the entire time. He quickly approached, smiling apologetically, "Were these treasures not to Immortal's liking?  It's my fault for being blind.  There's a Realman-level auction in six months.  I wonder if Immortal would be interested?"</p><p>As he spoke, the young man handed over an invitation.</p><p>Qin Sang unfolded it and found it was indeed an invitation. It listed some of the treasures to be auctioned, along with brief descriptions.</p><p>The young man added a timely reminder, "This auction mainly uses bartering or Dao Court Merit for transactions. If Immortal wishes to participate, you'll need to prepare in advance."</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in acknowledgement.  Just like in the Storm Realm, transactions above the Nascent Soul realm rarely used spirit stones.</p><p>However, this realm had a substitute.</p><p>The treasures listed, in the eyes of a Deity Transformation cultivator, were merely decent.  However, Qin Sang decided to accept the invitation to broaden his horizons.</p><p>He inquired further, but was disappointed.</p><p>This auction was already the Jushan Association's highest-level auction.  Anything higher would be the grand auction held every few decades, which was still more than ten years away.</p><p>The so-called "Realman-level" actually referred to Nascent Soul Realmans, while Qin Sang was more interested in participating in exchanges between Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>"There shouldn't be too many Deity Transformation cultivators outside the Dao Gate..." Qin Sang pondered.  The Dao Gate controlled high-level cultivation methods and wouldn't allow too many powerful figures to emerge outside their influence.</p><p>These Deity Transformation cultivators generally didn't reveal themselves, conducting transactions only amongst themselves. He was still an outsider and needed to find someone to introduce him.</p><p>The reason he wanted to participate in such a trade meeting was that his current strength was limited, and he wanted to acquire a few protective treasures, ideally a pseudo-spiritual treasure or even a spiritual treasure suitable for a physical cultivator.</p><p>If possible, he was willing to trade the Four-Element Serpent Seal.</p><p>Ever since this spiritual treasure came into his possession, it had mainly been used by his avatar. Although Qin Sang himself had mastered the Tongbao Art, he couldn't fully utilize the treasure's power.</p><p>Now that his avatar was lost, it was better to exchange it for a spiritual treasure more suited to himself.</p><p>However, finding a suitable trade wasn't easy.</p><p>Qin Sang considered his own resources. He still had quite a few items of unknown origin, such as the three incomplete treasures obtained from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>The Chengying Sword, the Broken Drum, and the Scroll!</p><p>The Wuxiang Immortal Sect didn't know the origins of these three treasures, placing them within the Lang Huan Bell.</p><p>Qin Sang had studied the Dao of Refining for many years, yet he was also helpless against them.</p><p>However, the strength and knowledge of the cultivators in this realm far surpassed those of the Storm Realm. Perhaps there was a Refining Master who could discern their origins and restore them.</p><p>Pondering these matters, Qin Sang left the Jushan Association. He first rented a secluded cave dwelling on the island, then began to gather information on the sects and factions of the Star Island Immortal Lake, especially those that offered teachings to outsiders.</p><p>He had already collected some information in Heming Mountain, but the information here would be more comprehensive, allowing him to cross-reference.</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in his cave dwelling, several jade slips laid out on the ground, another held in his hand.</p><p>This jade slip contained information carefully selected and painstakingly verified by Qin Sang from a vast amount of data, ensuring its accuracy.</p><p>Recorded within the jade slip were several sects that Qin Sang believed might be suitable for him, and where he might have a chance to obtain teachings.</p><p>The first sect was the Zhuyan Palace.</p><p>The Zhuyan Palace was a sect of the Star Island Immortal Lake, whose teachings included the Seven Star Zhuyan Art, precisely the Fire Element cultivation method Qin Sang was seeking.</p><p>The Zhuyan Palace offered teachings to outsiders, and Qin Sang had already inquired about the conditions, which were all listed.</p><p>One condition was rather difficult: only subordinate sects of the Zhuyan Palace were eligible to receive teachings, unless one was a descendant of someone who had rendered a great service to the Palace.</p><p>If he sought the Seven Star Zhuyan Art, he might have to find a way to infiltrate one of the subordinate sects.</p><p>This wasn't the first time Qin Sang had done something like this, so he didn't find it particularly difficult. However, it might require him to remain undercover within the Zhuyan Palace for a long time.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, then turned his attention to the second sect he had selected—the Thunder Left Mansion.</p><p>And the third sect—the Thunder Right Mansion.</p><p>Qin Sang was initially surprised when he learned about these two sects.</p><p>Not only were their names similar, but their mountain gates were both located on the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>Although Qin Sang hadn't found concrete evidence, various signs indicated that these two sects might have once belonged to the same sect, splitting into Left and Right Mansions for unknown reasons.</p><p>Now, the Thunder Left Mansion and Thunder Right Mansion were located in the eastern and western parts of the Star Island Immortal Lake, respectively, and they were not on good terms, with frequent conflicts between their disciples.</p><p>Both the Thunder Left Mansion and Thunder Right Mansion possessed their own Sect Altars and were able to impart teachings.  Even the name of their cultivation methods was the same—the High Divine Empyrean Art.</p><p>As for whether there were any differences between the methods of the Left and Right Mansions, Qin Sang wasn't yet certain.</p><p>The High Divine Empyrean Art belonged to the Thunder Element, which was one of the reasons Qin Sang had chosen them.</p><p>Both Mansions offered teachings to outsiders, unlike the Zhuyan Palace, which restricted access to its subordinate sects. However, the conditions were said to be quite demanding and difficult to fulfill.</p><p>All three sects were top-tier powers within the Star Island Immortal Lake. While the strength of a sect didn't directly correlate to the quality of its cultivation methods, it was still indicative.</p><p>There were a few other sects as backup options, but if possible, Qin Sang preferred to obtain a method from one of these three.</p><p>Choosing between the three sects required careful consideration.</p><p>Choosing the Thunder Left or Right Mansions might be easier, as it wouldn't require him to maintain a disguise.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was unsure when he would be able to control the Azure Roc's Origin Thunder Power. If he couldn't control it even by the late Deity Transformation stage, it could become a problem.</p><p>Using the Thunder Turtle's demon core to forge an altar would likely only support his cultivation up to the mid-Deity Transformation stage.</p><p>The Zhuyan Palace had the advantage of offering a Fire Element method, and he possessed various spiritual flames. Once the Vermilion Bird fledgling awakened, it could also assist him.</p><p>But regardless of which sect he chose, there was another point Qin Sang had to consider. These three sects, as top-tier powers of the Star Island Immortal Lake, likely had Deity Transformation level experts residing within them.</p><p>Receiving teachings required being at the sect's altar. If he suppressed his cultivation level to participate, there was a risk of exposure.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering, the restrictions outside his cave dwelling were suddenly triggered.</p><p>A servant girl's voice came from outside, "Reporting to Immortal, Master Qi's disciple has opened the cave dwelling's restrictions.  It is said that Master Qi has finished refining and just left seclusion."</p><p>"Understood," Qin Sang said in a deep voice, putting away the jade slips and rising to his feet, deciding to visit this Master Qi first.</p><p>Master Qi was a renowned Refining Master in Huzhong City, who had been in secluded cultivation refining a treasure.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
