<h1></h1><p>Back then, the situation was urgent. After Qin Sang broke the Golden Dome Buddha Hall's restriction, he only glanced around hastily.</p><p>Buddha statues, stone statues, offering tables.</p><p>Corpses, magical artifacts.</p><p>It could be confirmed that there were no written inscriptions.</p><p>The seven-layered pagoda was hidden inside the Guanyin statue, with an outer layer of Buddhist shrine, placed at the center of the offering table, holding a more important position than the Spiritual Ganoderma Scepter and the Wish-fulfilling Pearl.</p><p>Such an arrangement must have a reason.</p><p>"Could it be a symbol of a certain senior's status, holding special significance for the Pure Sea Sect?"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He rolled his eyes and gazed intently at the seven-layered pagoda. "That person's...relic, being worshiped as a sacred object?"</p><p>He recalled the stone statue that shouldn't have been in the Buddha Hall.</p><p>The stone statue held equal status with the Buddha statues, being worshiped together in the Buddha Hall. This was blasphemy towards the Buddha and their own beliefs.</p><p>The Pure Sea Sect shouldn't have committed such an error; even the grace of saving their lives wouldn't have made Buddhist disciples go to such lengths.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a strong curiosity towards that stone statue.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tan Hao didn't know about it.</p><p>The stone statue was lifelike, with clear facial features.</p><p>If this person was a senior expert originating from the North Sea, it shouldn't be difficult to find out.</p><p>"I'll investigate that person's identity first, then consider it further."</p><p>Qin Sang temporarily put away the seven-layered pagoda.</p><p>After that.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed in his cave abode, indifferent to worldly affairs.</p><p>While refining the Demonic Flame and the Wish-fulfilling Pearl, he pondered how to modify the Demon Subduing Pestle, and used the Demon Subduing Pestle to reflect the forging methods of the Buddhist sect, gaining a lot.</p><p>Since it was changing the outer appearance, not improving the rank of the Demon Subduing Pestle, there was no need for overly precious materials.</p><p>Qin Sang rummaged through the Thousand Jun Ring and found several items, which were about enough.</p><p>More than two months later.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Demonic Flame to reforge the Demon Subduing Pestle.</p><p>In his hands, the imposing Demon Subduing Pestle underwent a huge transformation. The Buddhist patterns on it disappeared, and protrusions appeared on the surface, turning into spikes. In the end, it actually became a wolf's tooth club!</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang wielded it in his hand, and the image of a burly man, Tan Hao, using the wolf's tooth club to smash his opponents flashed in his mind. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.</p><p>After putting away the wolf's tooth club and meditating for a while, the restriction of the cave abode was suddenly triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke and pushed the door open. Sure enough, Tan Hao had returned.</p><p>"Try it out."</p><p>Qin Sang threw the wolf's tooth club to him.</p><p>"The reforging is complete?"</p><p>Tan Hao grabbed the wolf's tooth club with a face full of joy. He wielded it a few times, unable to put it down, and refined it according to Qin Sang's instructions. The wolf's tooth club immediately lit up with bursts of dark blue light, which was obviously a fierce weapon.</p><p>"I did my best to conceal it. However, the essence of a Buddhist treasure cannot be changed. Once you fight someone, your opponent will still be able to sense the unique fluctuations of the Buddhist restrictions. Don't leave any future troubles."</p><p>Qin Sang instructed him, then changed his tone and asked, "What did you find out?"</p><p>Tan Hao happily put away the wolf's tooth club and said seriously, "The waves caused by the Pure Sea Sect have not yet dissipated. There are still many cultivators lingering in the Empty Spirit Sea, and some even came from afar. However, the traces of the Pure Sea Sect have been erased from the world by the Crimson Flame aura. I haven't heard of anyone finding any treasures yet, but there are quite a few swindlers taking advantage of the situation. In the beginning, Nascent Soul Ancestors appeared frequently, but they haven't been seen recently..."</p><p>Next, Tan Hao picked out the important points from the news he had found and told Qin Sang.</p><p>"The collapse of the seal caused countless cultivators to die tragically, an uncountable number. However, apart from the anomaly of the eruption of the Crimson Flame aura, there were no other anomalies. The Old Fiend Hunmo and other Nascent Souls did not erupt in a great battle either. After waiting for the anomalies to disappear, they searched around for a while, and then left one after another."</p><p>Qin Sang hmm'ed. "No great battle occurred. It seems that the demon inside the seal has already fallen. Of course, it is also possible that he used some means to deceive everyone's eyes, but it has little to do with us. Continue, is there any news about Qi and Wang?"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded and said, "The identities of these two people are not difficult to find out. The Qi fellow and the Ring-Holding True Master, the island lord of Nine Ring Island, are both overlords near the Empty Spirit Sea. The two have always been at odds, and there are often frictions between their juniors. He did not establish a sect, but has eight disciples under his command. The Wang female cultivator recently formed her Nascent Soul and is said to be his Dao Companion."</p><p>Qin Sang silently recited the name of the Ring-Holding True Master, knowing that the second person who ambushed them was him.</p><p>However, this person has the Old Fiend Hunmo behind him, so it is not easy to find trouble with him for the time being.</p><p>Tan Hao continued, "At first, I didn't dare to directly inquire about the news of the eight disciples, but I soon heard rumors that the island where the Qi cultivator's cave abode was located was attacked by a mysterious expert. All the mortals and cultivators on the island were slaughtered, leaving nothing behind. However, there are rumors that the eight disciples had mysteriously disappeared before the massacre, their whereabouts unknown, but this cannot be confirmed."</p><p>The eight disciples mysteriously disappeared, possibly taken away by someone.</p><p>They didn't know what happened in the Pure Sea Sect, and Qi and Wang couldn't have imagined that a chance encounter would cause such a big storm, so it was impossible to guard against it in advance.</p><p>In that case, someone among Valley Master Mu and the other two survived.</p><p>Most likely it was Valley Master Mu, who has the highest cultivation level. He also has the Four Transformations Tide-Bringing Horseshoe Crab.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart relaxed slightly. In this way, it would be much easier to find him for a trade later.</p><p>"These are the people and forces in the Boundless Sea who are good at refining pills and accept commissions," Tan Hao handed him a jade slip.</p><p>Unless it was a major event like the Pure Sea Sect, Nascent Soul Ancestors rarely appeared in the world.</p><p>Golden Core cultivators are the protagonists of the cultivation world.</p><p>The information Tan Hao collected was very detailed.</p><p>"The most reputable and the most proficient in the Dao of Pills in the Boundless Sea is actually the Great Elder of the Nine Stars Association."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised to see this information.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang excluded the Nine Stars Association.</p><p>When he entered the Pure Sea Sect, he had inquired about the Empty Spirit Sea in the Nine Stars Association. Now that this incident has occurred, the Nine Stars Association will definitely be able to associate it with the anomaly. It is best not to deal with them again.</p><p>He browsed quickly and gradually frowned.</p><p>The other targets were either incompetent or unreliable.</p><p>Although he was not afraid of the other party getting greedy upon seeing the treasure, he still hoped to have less trouble.</p><p>"Huh, the Pill Cauldron Meet."</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fixed on a force. He found that this was also a chamber of commerce, and behind it was actually the shadow of the famous Pill Cauldron Mountain of the String Moon Realm.</p><p>Pill Cauldron Mountain has a great reputation in both the Dao of Forging and the Dao of Pills, equivalent to a combination of the Supreme Alchemy Sect and the Void Spirit Sect, and its reputation is quite good.</p><p>He originally planned to go to the String Moon Realm if he couldn't find it in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>He decided to go to the Pill Cauldron Meet.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, said a few words to Tan Hao, and then returned to the quiet room to meditate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than half a year passed.</p><p>During this period, Tan Hao went out to inquire a few more times, and the results were similar.</p><p>The turmoil brought about by the Pure Sea Sect seemed to have completely subsided.</p><p>A figure broke through the water surface, flying close to the sea surface, heading west. It was Qin Sang.</p><p>He was going to the Pill Cauldron Meet now to ask someone to refine the Hidden Fragrance Pill.</p><p>The Pill Cauldron Meet was not a local force, and its strongholds were sparse.</p><p>Qin Sang chose the nearest stronghold, an island called Blue Star Island. It was said that commerce was prosperous on the island. Qin Sang was not in a hurry to rush, and it took him more than half a month to arrive.</p>
