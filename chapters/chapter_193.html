<h1>Chapter One Hundred Eighty-Six Breaking the Forbidden</h1><p>Chapter One Hundred Eighty-Six Breaking the Forbidden</p><p>Southwest of ShaoHua Mountain.</p><p>On a calm body of water, water met sky on all sides, as far as the eye could see. There was not even a small island, so it appeared extraordinarily desolate.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew causing the water to ripple, but this body of water seemed very calm and not dangerous.</p><p>At this moment, a fluctuation suddenly appeared in the air above the water. Then, three figures emerged out of thin air. They were Qin Sang and the Le sisters, who had come here quietly.</p><p>“Senior Qin, True Person Cang Li’s cave abode is beneath us.”</p><p>Le Xing and Le Rou pointed at an area of the water and said in soft voices.</p><p>They had reached an agreement with Jing Po as a witness, Shu Gen would remain in the secret shop, and Qin Sang only needed to crack the restrictions of True Person Cang Li’s cave abode. Then, he could get the item.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. Not only was there not a single island in his field of vision, but within a radius of several hundred miles, he could not find a single one. It was extremely desolate. He tried to use his spiritual sense to probe, but the water was very deep and he could not reach the bottom.</p><p>The trio cast the water遁法 and entered the water. They continued to dive deep into the water. The Le sisters led the way. They must have come here many times and were very familiar with the place.</p><p>They finally saw the bottom of the lake. The mud and sand were clear, and the water plants were lush. Fish and shrimp swam among the water plants, and it seemed as peaceful as a peach blossom forest.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his spiritual sense and discovered some妖兽 hidden in the mud. They were all very weak, and there was no value in killing them. Spirit herbs grew between the stone crevices. They looked quite good. For low-level cultivators, they could harvest them every once in a while and get good gains.</p><p>Slightly stronger immortal cultivators would not stay in such a poor place, let alone know that there was a Core Formation cultivator's cave abode here. True Person Cang Li had indeed found a good place.</p><p>“True Person Cang Li’s cave abode is here?”</p><p>Qin Sang stepped on a black stone at the bottom of the water and asked the Le sisters.</p><p>In front of them, the terrain at the bottom of the water looked like a large area of hilly terrain, with large and small mounds scattered everywhere. Some were covered with water plants, and some were bare. The entire water area looked like this. There were no deep ravines, no dangerous peaks. It seemed very ordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang flew around this hilly area and searched for it for a while with his spiritual sense, but he did not find anything unusual, let alone any trace of a cave abode.</p><p>The Le sisters smiled at each other and explained, “Senior Qin, the reason we can't see True Person Cang Li’s cave abode is because of the terrain. There is a natural illusion formation here. It not only hides True Person Cang Li’s cave abode, but also conceals the spiritual veins very well. My sisters were picking herbs nearby when we stumbled upon the illusion formation and entered it by accident. That's how we learned the secret here. Otherwise, True Person Cang Li’s cave abode would have already fallen into someone else's hands. It’s not easy to discover the illusion formation, but it’s not difficult to crack it. We just need to follow the correct path to get in. Senior Qin, please follow me.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed in amazement. There were countless strange things between heaven and earth. Naturally formed illusion formations were not rare, but it was extremely rare for one to form a perfect cave abode.</p><p>As she spoke, Le Xing said somewhat embarrassedly, “Senior Qin, my sisters have a small favor to ask. If possible, can you not destroy this illusion formation when breaking the restriction?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately understood Le Xing’s intention.</p><p>The Le sisters did not have the financial resources or channels to purchase a Black Tortoise Battle Formation. This illusion formation may be the only barrier of the cave abode in the future. For something that he could easily do, Qin Sang would not be so ruthless.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang had agreed, the two sisters happily led the way. Qin Sang followed behind. The trio’s figures flickered. Finally, they arrived at the core of the hill and landed on the top of a hill covered with water plants.</p><p>The Le sisters stepped on the ground and turned their heads. “Senior Qin, please walk as we do. Don't use any遁法 or take a wrong step. This natural illusion formation is not fixed and is very unpredictable. If we activate the illusion formation and are trapped inside, it will take a long time to break free.”</p><p>Qin Sang followed their advice obediently. Although the Jade Buddha could help him avoid a maze, it was helpless against illusion formations.</p><p>The Le sisters took a step forward and immediately disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Star Tears to protect his body and was on guard. He followed closely behind. After he took a step, the scene in front of him changed drastically. The terrain around him was still hilly, but the lake water beside him disappeared, and his vision was blocked by a thick fog. He could only see less than ten feet in front of him.</p><p>The Le sisters were waiting for him in front. Seeing Qin Sang come in, they were relieved. They nodded at him and continued to move forward.</p><p>As we walked through the mist, we turned left and right, and soon the thick mist in front of us suddenly dispersed to both sides. In the center of the mist, a bare hill appeared in our sight.</p><p>When we entered this place, we were immediately bathed in a strong spiritual force, which was not much worse than the栖龙岛 occupied by the Liu brothers. Sure enough, there was a spiritual vein below, which was completely concealed by the illusion array, and there was no trace of leakage.</p><p>The hill was full of white stones, and there was not a single blade of grass, it was extremely barren. At the bottom of the hill, there was a simple stone gate, with a simple door frame made of stone strips, and the word "沧漓" was written on the top in flying dragon and phoenix dance. Apart from that, there was no other decoration. It looked like a cave of ascetic monks.</p><p>Surrounding the hills was a layer of light blue water curtain, which was the highlight of this trip.</p><p>"Senior Qin, this water curtain is the cave restriction. Once the restriction is triggered, there will be overwhelming ice blades, water arrows and other attacks. The stronger the force that breaks the restriction, the more severe the counterattack will be. Please be careful, Senior," Le Xing seemed to recall the danger he had encountered before, and his face turned slightly pale.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, staring at the water curtain, and after watching for a long time, he still didn't see anything unusual.</p><p>There was a copy of her experience with the array restriction among the relics of Senior Sister Qing Ting. When Qin Sang returned the relics to Qing Ting's family, he copied a copy of the experience, but he had no time to study it.</p><p>Not only did he not have time to read the experience, but he also had many other things to do. He had not yet smelted the golden snow cedar into the ebony sword, and the Thousand Machine Sword Array he had obtained from Wu Yuesheng was still lying in his mustard seed bag.</p><p>Before he came, Qin Sang had made up his mind that if the restriction was too strong, he would ask Senior Brother Wen and others to help. If the restriction was not that powerful, he would use the restriction to figure out the experience, which could be considered killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>The Le sisters were weak and could not test the full power of the restriction. Qin Sang stretched out his hand and drew the Five Elements Breaking Law Sword out with a whimper, then took out a transparent fire cover from the Mustard Seed Bag and covered the Le sisters under it.</p><p>This cover is called the Divine Fire Cover, which Qin Sang found in the relics of the White Cloud Hermit. The Divine Fire Cover is a very common protective magic weapon. It is powerful and难得所需的灵材 are not expensive, so it is very popular among casual cultivators.</p><p>Protecting the Le sisters and himself, Qin Sang stretched out his hand and flicked, and five sword lights rushed towards the restriction together.</p>
