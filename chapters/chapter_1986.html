<h1>Chapter 1977: The Game of Pieces</h1><p>Xuan Country Border.</p><p>A million troops stood in a deadlock.  The armies stretched for dozens of miles, encamped and entrenched, soldiers like ants and tents like a forest.  Battle after battle had stained the earth crimson. The blood had seeped deep into the ground, turning the soil a dark red three feet down.  The fallen soldiers were countless, a ghastly sight.</p><p>As the sun dawned, the battlefield echoed with the roar of battle cries.</p><p>Within the Yan Country camp, a hill overlooked the battlefield.  Here, the command tent was erected.</p><p>In front of the command tent, Yulang stood with several generals, leaning against the railing and facing the east. The blood-red dawn light bathed them.</p><p>Everyone wore a grave expression, their gazes fixed on the heart of the battlefield.</p><p>Years of military life had hardened Yulang's features.  The scholarly air had diminished, replaced by a steely resolve. He watched the soldiers locked in mortal combat, his heart heavy with worry.  He inadvertently glanced south.</p><p>Not far to the south, a towering peak rose even higher than the hill beneath their feet, a superior vantage point for observing the battle.  It was one of the highest points on the battlefield.</p><p>However, mortals were forbidden to ascend that mountain.</p><p>Everyone knew it was an Immortal Mountain.  A newly built palace stood upon it, the residence of Immortal Masters.  Even on stone platforms and sheer cliffs, figures of Immortal Masters could be seen, meditating.  Mist shrouded them, making them appear ethereal and otherworldly, exuding an air of immortal grace.  Whenever the soldiers saw this mountain, their faces filled with reverence.</p><p>A similar place existed within the enemy camp.</p><p>Yulang’s worry wasn't that their side's cultivators were inferior to the enemy's.  On the contrary, they had won more battles than they had lost.  What truly troubled him was the mounting casualties and the seemingly endless slaughter.  The battlefield in between was like a demonic abyss, devouring countless lives, a pit that no amount of blood could fill.</p><p>Over the years, Yulang had witnessed too much death, becoming numb to it.  Yet, at this moment, he couldn't bear it.  In his view, so much of the bloodshed was meaningless.</p><p>The involvement of cultivators hadn't hastened the war's end; instead, it had intensified the carnage.  If there were no cultivators involved, he was confident he could stake everything on a decisive battle, crushing the enemy army in one fell swoop, instead of this endless entanglement.</p><p>In truth, he hadn't expected to remain in the position of commander for so long. He had assumed that with the intervention of cultivators, the conflict would inevitably transform into a struggle between them. On the battlefield, cultivator casualties were unavoidable.  Casualties bred hatred, escalating from individuals to sects, and even into a righteous-demonic confrontation. Both sides would call upon allies, weaving a tangled web of grudges and alliances, drawing in more and more people and factions.  Most conflicts evolved in this manner.</p><p>Once Nascent Soul cultivators joined the fray, who would care about mortals?  When the mighty figures on both sides determined a victor, the mortal world would naturally follow suit, falling under the victor's control.</p><p>However, reality defied his expectations.  Both the righteous and demonic sides exercised restraint.  Apart from the Nascent Soul Grand Ancestors who oversaw the armies and intimidated the enemy, no Gold Core or higher-level cultivators appeared on the battlefield. Even when cultivators fell in battle, the sect members who came seeking revenge never surpassed the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>As long as it remained this way, it was manageable.  Being Foundation Establishment cultivators, these individuals, bound by their sect's orders, wouldn't openly defy his commands as commander.</p><p>Yulang meticulously planned and strategized, gradually pushing back the enemy's forces, ushering in the final decisive battle.  But as the decisive battle approached, powerful figures emerged like bamboo shoots after the rain.</p><p>Yulang was now uncertain how many Gold Core and Nascent Soul cultivators were present on the mountain. These mighty figures weren’t merely observers; they had also brought ‘treasures.’</p><p>At this very moment, a faint crimson mist permeated the battlefield, accompanied by the rhythmic clang of gongs.</p><p>Three thousand soldiers stood on each side.</p><p>The crimson mist emanated from the Blood Essence Banners held by the Yan Country soldiers.</p><p>The gong sound originated from the enemy’s bronze gongs.  The enemy had formed a semi-circular formation.  At the rear stood a Foundation Establishment cultivator, holding a large, gleaming gold gong.  Five hundred soldiers surrounded him, each holding a palm-sized bronze gong.</p><p>The sound of the gongs reverberated through the air.  These soldiers, focused solely on beating the gongs, were clearly outnumbered in the actual fighting.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the gong sound carried a strange power.  Rings of light pulsed outwards, falling upon their comrades at the front.  The soldiers’ morale surged, their bodies radiating a bronze glow as if forged from iron.  They faced the dragon-shaped blood energy coalesced by the Blood Essence Banners without flinching.</p><p>Conversely, the Yan Country side, affected by the gong sound, began to lose their formation.</p><p>Previous battles had unfolded similarly. The defeated side, three thousand strong, were either slaughtered or captured, while the cultivators often escaped.</p><p>Both sides provided various treasures and spells, yet they decided victory and defeat through the flesh and blood of mortals, using countless lives as fodder.</p><p>Yulang didn't understand the agreement between the righteous and demonic sides. He only knew that if this continued, more and more people would die needlessly.</p><p>“It’s like this again!”</p><p>A large chessboard was divided into smaller ones, and even the smallest boards had players and pieces.  No matter the game, mortals were merely pawns, manipulated at will.</p><p>This was precisely what Yulang abhorred!</p><p>He had believed he had a chance to change things, but now he felt powerless. His position as commander wasn't merely symbolic; he determined the troop deployments and formations. Yet, after each battle, regardless of victory or defeat, Yulang felt only sorrow.</p><p>“Can Master change this situation?”</p><p>Yulang gazed at the clear sky, lost in thought.  In his heart, his Master was omnipotent.  Having not encountered any danger himself, he used a bamboo slip without hesitation, driven by his convictions.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A furious roar suddenly erupted from the battlefield.  The roar came from the Yan Country soldiers.  Like the roar of the dragon-shaped blood energy, it boomed like thunder, shaking the very soul.</p><p>The gong rhythm faltered for an instant under the impact of the roar.  The Yan Country side seized the fleeting opportunity, surging forward and shattering the enemy formation.</p><p>‘Clang! Clang! Clang!’</p><p>The cultivator desperately beat the gong.  Seeing his side's increasing disarray and inability to regroup, he immediately abandoned his soldiers, transforming into a streak of light and fleeing.  He dared not linger; otherwise, if caught by the dragon-shaped blood energy, he would face certain doom.</p><p>The Yan Country side returned victorious, their faces beaming with joy.  A flicker of sorrow crossed Yulang's eyes.  He sighed inwardly, then caught sight of a figure in his peripheral vision.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>He had suddenly seen his long-absent Master.</p><p>In this moment, Yulang was overwhelmed with a mix of joy and sorrow.  He suddenly wondered if it would have been better to follow his senior sister’s path and return to the tranquil Qingyang Temple.</p><p>“You’ve done well,” Qin Sang surveyed the battlefield, offering sincere praise.  His words weren’t empty flattery. Yulang's ability to become a commander of ten thousand troops had truly exceeded Qin Sang’s expectations.</p><p>Qin Sang knew his disciple had done his utmost.  Most commendable was that, despite the hardships, Yulang hadn’t abandoned his principles.  Although Yulang’s principles differed from his own, Qin Sang felt a sense of pride for his disciple.</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>Yulang’s eyes blurred slightly, a surge of emotions welling up within him.  It stemmed from his Master’s affirmation, but even more so from his experiences over the years.</p><p>Just then, the defeated enemy dispatched another wave of troops onto the battlefield, issuing a challenge.  From afar, all the soldiers could be seen wearing wooden armor. The wood was of an unknown type, and branches with green leaves even sprouted from certain parts.</p><p>These soldiers formed their ranks, becoming as rooted to the earth as ancient trees, immovable by any force.</p><p>“General Qin, please instruct us, who should we send to face them!”</p><p>“Yuan Qing of Yulong Mountain requests to fight!”</p><p>…</p><p>Roaring challenges echoed from the Yan Country camp.</p><p>Yulang looked at his Master.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, sending a gentle breeze towards the enemy formation.  A series of cracking sounds immediately followed.</p><p>The three thousand soldiers were horrified to discover cracks appearing on their armor, shattering into fragments and falling away.  The feeling of being rooted to the earth, unshakeable and firm, vanished instantly.  They felt a lightness beneath their feet and were flung backward, tumbling like gourds, their cries of alarm filling the air.</p><p>“Who dares act so presumptuously!”</p><p>“Who is it!”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang’s action immediately drew a barrage of furious shouts, some even originating from the southern mountain.</p><p>In the next moment, figures flew out from the mountain.  The sky above the battlefield suddenly filled with hundreds of figures, primarily Gold Core cultivators, but also a number of Nascent Soul Grand Ancestors with profound auras.</p><p>All eyes converged on the scene.</p><p>Yulang's heart trembled, but beside his Master, he felt a sense of reassurance, devoid of fear.</p><p>“Who are you!”</p><p>A middle-aged man stepped forward from the opposing side.  He was ordinary in appearance, with a pale complexion and a thin frame, resembling a convalescent.  However, the others, upon seeing him, showed him respect, stepping aside deferentially.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng?”</p><p>A surprised voice called out from the south. Someone recognized Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways, seeing Yin Heqian, and nodded in acknowledgement.  Then, turning to the middle-aged man, he rose into the air and said with a smile, “With mighty figures present on both sides, why this tedious charade?  When will a victor be decided?  This humble Daoist lacks patience and has grown weary of waiting.  Which fellow Daoist will step forward for a battle?”</p><p>The middle-aged man frowned, glancing at the Kuang Clan Grand Ancestor, his gaze seemingly questioning.</p><p>The Kuang Clan Grand Ancestor called Yin Heqian to his side and inquired briefly.  After a moment of contemplation, he said, “So this is General Qin’s master, Daoist Qingfeng?  Truly an impressive presence…”</p><p>He flickered and flew to Qin Sang’s side, cupping his hands in greeting.  “I am Kuang Wujiang. Greetings, Daoist.”</p><p>“Greetings, Fellow Daoist Kuang.”</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang wasn’t arrogant, the Kuang Clan Grand Ancestor’s expression softened slightly.  He gestured towards the southern mountain. “Unaware of your esteemed arrival, we failed to welcome you properly. We have brought some spiritual tea and immortal wine from our sect.  Would Daoist be willing to grace us with your presence?”</p><p>“Not yet!”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively.  “Let us capture these demonic fiends first, then we shall drink tea.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The Kuang Clan Grand Ancestor frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously, “What troubles you, Fellow Daoist Kuang?  Or is it that among these demonic fiends, there exists someone with unparalleled demonic arts, making you apprehensive of battle?”</p><p>Hearing this, the Kuang Clan Grand Ancestor couldn’t help but feel a surge of anger. Suppressing his fury, he said, “Please, Daoist, come to the southern mountain, and this old man will explain everything.”</p><p>“There’s no need for such trouble.  Even if there exists a peerless demonic fiend, this humble Daoist is willing to meet them and experience their demonic arts firsthand!  Since none of you wish to come out, this humble Daoist will go myself!”</p><p>The last sentence was directed at the opposing side.</p><p>Before his voice faded, a sword beam shot out from Qin Sang’s sleeve. It wasn't the Grey Warbler Sword, but a random spiritual sword he had taken.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The sword hummed resonantly.  Before anyone could react, it shot towards the middle-aged man's head.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>The middle-aged man was startled and enraged. He slapped his waist, and a greyish-white cord flew out.</p><p>The cord was crystalline, like a long tendon.  It wasn't made of ox or dragon tendon, but woven from countless human tendons, known as the Soul Tendon.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Soul Tendon snapped forth, whistling through the air, emitting mournful cries as if trailed by a multitude of vengeful spirits, a chilling sight.</p><p>Just as the Soul Tendon was about to entangle the spiritual sword, without any visible movement from Qin Sang, the sword beam trembled and abruptly split into ten, then continued to divide, until in the blink of an eye, it was impossible to count how many sword beams there were.</p><p>The middle-aged man felt a momentary disorientation and found himself surrounded by sword beams, omnipresent and inescapable.</p><p>“No good!”</p><p>The middle-aged man was alarmed and hastily recalled the Soul Tendon, but it was too late.  All the sword beams vanished from his sight.</p><p>He knew they hadn't truly disappeared, only that he could no longer see them.  There was only one possibility – he had fallen into a sword formation!</p><p>This formation was the璇玑剑阵(Xuanji Sword Formation) that Qin Sang had learned at the Formless Immortal Sect, specializing in the Dao of Illusionary Swordsmanship.</p><p>He had been trapped within the sword formation in a single exchange.</p><p>The others, witnessing this scene, were stunned.  The middle-aged man was a peak expert at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, renowned as the strongest below the late-Nascent Soul stage, yet he wasn't even a match for a single blow.</p><p>Just what was the background of this Daoist Qingfeng?</p><p>“Big Brother!”</p><p>A young man cried out in alarm, hastily summoning a demonic blade and slashing it towards Qin Sang’s head.  The blade’s edge was immeasurably sharp.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, glancing sideways at the Kuang Clan Grand Ancestor.  “Fellow Daoist, aren't you going to act?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The Kuang Clan Grand Ancestor was momentarily unsure of what to do.</p><p>The righteous and demonic paths had nothing to do with Cloud Metropolis Heaven or the Fallen Soul Abyss.  They were merely compelled to comply due to the overwhelming power of these two forces.</p><p>Neither side wished to fight a life-or-death battle for the two major powers, so they had established a gentleman's agreement, deciding to use mortals as pieces in a game to determine victory or defeat.  This way, they could also minimize casualties.</p><p>Of course, this was predicated on the satisfaction of the two major powers.  Otherwise, they would have to personally enter the fray.  This was also a way to test the attitudes of the two major powers.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a disruptor had appeared.</p><p>Daoist Qingfeng was clearly on their side.  The Kuang Clan Grand Ancestor couldn't stand idly by and watch him be attacked, so he had no choice but to summon his spiritual sword and block the demonic blade.</p><p>A playful smile appeared on Qin Sang’s face as he rapidly changed his sword hand seals.</p><p>In the eyes of the onlookers, the interior of the sword formation was a chaotic blur.  No one knew what was happening inside.  Then, the sword light converged, shooting back towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Within the sword light, a figure was clearly visible, wrapped within.</p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes were wide with shock and disbelief.  He had lost all ability to resist, reduced to a captive!</p><p>Instantly, an uproar erupted.</p><p>The righteous side was also stunned.  Only after hearing Qin Sang’s bellow, “What are you waiting for?” did they hesitantly charge forward.</p><p>A chaotic battle erupted in a manner no one had anticipated.</p><p>Soon, streaks of light converged from all directions, emanating auras even stronger than the middle-aged man’s.  They were all late-Nascent Soul experts, sect Grand Ancestors.  Seeing the situation spiraling out of control, they were filled with fury.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene unfolded. The demonic cultivators were no match for Daoist Qingfeng, falling in defeat one after another.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in the air, his gaze fixed on a mountain hundreds of miles away.</p><p>On the mountain, Immortal Yun and the cloaked figure, witnessing this scene, wore stiff expressions.</p><p>Since they were so eager to drag him into their game, he would show them what he could do!</p><p>Not just this time, Qin Sang intended to disrupt their game completely, until he forced the two Soul Formation Grand Ancestors to emerge!</p>
