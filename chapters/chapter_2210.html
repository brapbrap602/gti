<h1>Chapter 2200 The Murky River</h1><p>Qin Sang held a transparent centipede in one hand. With a gentle gesture of the other, the Qianjun ring transformed back into a finger ring and flew back to his hand.</p><p>The small secluded realm was still in turmoil, but the waves were gradually subsiding.  The battle ended quickly, without causing any devastating destruction.</p><p>One can deduce an opponent's temperament during a fight. The man in green clearly valued his own safety more. He and the celestial child didn’t share a life-or-death bond, at least not to the extent of sharing opportunities. This trap was specifically set for him, and Qin Sang’s judgment proved correct.</p><p>The man in green even left a last resort, but even with the formidable power of the transparent centipede, how could it escape the eyes of the Heaven’s Eye Butterfly?</p><p>Qin Sang imprisoned the transparent centipede and threw it into the small secluded realm. He immediately felt an emptiness within his body.</p><p>The full exertion of the Yunyou Sword, a postnatal spiritual treasure, and the use of the sword domain ability, consumed a terrifying amount of energy. His current cultivation was still somewhat weak; he should be able to handle it more easily after breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>However, Nascent Soul cultivators can quickly replenish their energy from the world, and he would recover soon. A light flickered, and an object appeared in Qin Sang’s palm—a small, exquisite jade screen.</p><p>The surface of the jade screen was carved with a landscape, with towering mountains and overlapping peaks. Though only palm-sized, it exuded a vast and weighty aura.</p><p>Unfortunately, the jade screen's luster was dim, and a long crack ran through it, ruining its overall aesthetic.</p><p>This was a protective spiritual treasure of the man in green. He summoned it at the last moment, but under the combined assault of the Yunyou Sword, the Thunder Beast Guards, and the Heaven’s Eye Butterfly, he still failed to save his life, dying here.</p><p>This treasure is undoubtedly a top-tier defensive treasure, ranking among the highest-grade spiritual treasures. Although the Kuntian Golden Lock can create illusory realms, as seen from the talismans used by the celestial child and others, it has limitations, and there are ways to counter it. The jade screen, however, is purely a defensive treasure, making it possibly more crucial for most cultivators.</p><p>It was just bad luck for the man in green to encounter Qin Sang and the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>Whether this jade screen was a gift from the ancestor of the Yi people is unknown, but it clearly couldn't compare to the Imperial Heavenly Emperor Talisman.</p><p>Perhaps those Yi ancestors were not as wealthy as Ning Zhenren, or perhaps these juniors were not that important to the Yi ancestors.</p><p>Qin Sang used almost all his strength because he was worried about the man in green’s background, fearing that he possessed a treasure bestowed by the ancestor, leading to a failure. If the celestial child only possessed treasures of this level, his chances of winning would increase significantly.</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang had already left the spot and disappeared.</p><p>A formidable Void Refinement Stage 2 late-stage expert died here silently and unnoticed by the cloaked cultivator and the celestial child.</p><p>In the forefront, the chase between the celestial child and Qin Sang continued.</p><p>He had previously sent out a Dharma body to hide with the Heaven’s Eye Butterfly in the small secluded realm, leaving only his main body and a Nascent Soul initial stage Dharma image, significantly reducing his strength. Even with his best disguise, he inevitably showed flaws.</p><p>To delay for as long as possible, Qin Sang, without hesitation, shuttled through various secret realms and ancient prohibitions, using the surrounding environment to cover himself.</p><p>However, completely deceiving the celestial child was impossible. The celestial child quickly noticed something, but after observing the strange changes in Qin Sang, he did not choose to attack immediately.</p><p>Firstly, Qin Sang had repeatedly escaped danger, making him even more wary of Qin Sang, fearing some kind of trickery.</p><p>Secondly, the man in green was not by his side; he was secretly preparing a secret technique.</p><p>If the man in green wasn't exaggerating, once the technique was complete, he could trap Qin Sang.  He only needed to keep an eye on Qin Sang; a sudden change of plans could create unnecessary complications.</p><p>Therefore, the celestial child chose a 'steady' approach.</p><p>However, even if the celestial child attacked with all his might, Qin Sang was not completely defenseless. He kept Xiao Wu by his side, at least buying some time.</p><p>Unaware that he had missed his best chance, the celestial child continued to pursue Qin Sang while still concerned about the man in green in the rear.</p><p>The consequences of sending out a Dharma body became apparent; the distance between them gradually shortened. Qin Sang burst out of a secret realm, looking rather disheveled.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The sound of waves echoed from ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a large river ahead and rejoiced, secretly feeling fortunate.  The previously destroyed silk-like secret realm was the best choice among the others, which were relatively similar, including this river before him.</p><p>The river extended endlessly, floating in the void. The river water was murky yellow, with turbulent, choppy waves. The current was swift.</p><p>This was a poisonous river. The river water contained potent poison. According to records, this river was not originally this wide, but rather a winding river flowing through various secret realms.</p><p>The hidden realms were now cleansed by the river, leaving the Poison River surging powerfully.</p><p>This was the battlefield he had prepared for Xian Tong!</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated not at all, leaping directly into the Poison River.  The immense force of the current created towering waves at the river's heart.</p><p>Xian Tong followed closely, sensing the river's aura, his face instantly changing.</p><p>"Poison?"</p><p>He had prepared some antidotes, but not as effective as those used by true poison cultivators.</p><p>However, letting Qin Sang escape was absolutely unacceptable.</p><p>Before jumping into the river, Xian Tong couldn't help but glance back.  His companion, Tang, was still nowhere in sight.</p><p>Xian Tong wasn't worried that Tang would desert; they had a pact: only by killing Qin Sang could their promise be fulfilled.  He believed his offer held immense appeal for Tang.</p><p>The situation was now overwhelmingly favorable. Qin Sang was nearing his limit; once Qi arrived, victory would be secured. There was no reason to give up.</p><p>But why was Tang delaying the activation of his secret technique?</p><p>For some reason, Xian Tong felt a strange unease, yet he couldn't abandon Qin Sang to question him, so he secretly urged him with a secret technique.</p><p>As the river water touched him, Xian Tong released a wisp of colorful energy from his sleeve.  The energy coiled around him, and colorful scales, fine as snakeskin, appeared on his robes, radiating an eerie glow.</p><p>The scales shielded him from the river's potent poison, his speed unimpeded.  He quickly pursued Qin Sang into the river's depths.</p><p>Shortly after, a figure emerged from the riverbank—not Tang, as Xian Tong had hoped, but Qin Sang's phantom.</p><p>No surprises here, this could serve as Xian Tong's tomb! Qin Sang thought, This is the advantage of broad knowledge;  I can handle any situation.</p><p>He had been hunted for so long.  Releasing his pent-up frustration was just the beginning; killing Xian Tong would be the true triumph.</p><p>I wonder how Liuli is doing?</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind.  During the ambush, he and Liuli had employed a符道秘术 (Fu Dao secret technique), establishing a carefully prepared communication method. This technique required sharing their consciousness, a testament to their mutual trust, yet he still had no contact.</p><p>Perhaps the complex terrain was to blame; the ancient restrictions within the Panlong Cave were layered and intricate, disrupting the technique.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's phantom plunged into the Poison River, unrestrained, moving with incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang, knowing his phantom had slain the man in green, sensed its rapid approach and began planning his attack on Xian Tong.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly as he intermittently received Liuli's transmission.  Clearly affected by the Panlong Cave, the signal was extremely faint. His brow furrowed deeply.</p><p>He learned of Liuli's situation; she'd performed far better than he'd expected.  With the man in green dead, the situation had greatly tilted in their favor.  Without those two uninvited guests, they would have a good chance of killing Xian Tong here and escaping unscathed.</p><p>Those two introduced new variables. Liuli's decision bought them more time, but also put her in extreme danger. If those two discovered the truth, or if the black-robed cultivator sensed his companion's presence and secretly colluded with them, Liuli would face three powerful异人族 (Yi Ren Zu) warriors alone—an extremely perilous situation!</p><p>It's better to live to fight another day; even if this fails, I don't want Liuli to get hurt.</p><p>Eliminating the man in green was a significant victory. His death, shrouded in mystery, would serve as a deterrent.  Anyone who wants to cross me will have to think twice.</p><p>But even if he rushed back now, he wouldn't be able to reach Liuli in time. Moreover, affected by the Panlong Cave, Liuli's message was likely sent some time ago.  Currently, Liuli's only recourse is her imperial spirit talisman.  As long as its power remained, she could utilize the icy air of the glacier and her knowledge of the Panlong Cave to escape before her enemies reacted.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately contacted Liuli, informing her of his situation and urging her not to persist; if anything felt amiss, she should retreat immediately.</p><p>He and Xian Tong were deep within the Panlong Cave; it would take time for the enemy to arrive. Using this window, they might still be able to defeat Xian Tong.</p><p>Xian Tong likely never anticipated the possibility of being killed by Qin Sang, keeping all four of his companion beasts at his side, effectively relinquishing the Si You Clan's most valuable ability!</p><p>Unsure of Liuli's situation or whether she'd received his message, Qin Sang suppressed his anxiety, his eyes fierce.  He suddenly stopped moving, halting his escape.</p><p>'Whoosh… whoosh…'</p><p>The river flowed past him.</p><p>Qin Sang, unlike the celestial child relying on snake scales for protection, remained remarkably calm. River water flowed smoothly against his skin, causing him no harm.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's actions, the celestial child paused, momentarily.  Though he sensed Qin Sang's weakening, his first reaction wasn't joy, but alarm.</p><p>The celestial child, secretly annoyed, snorted, "Why aren't you running?"</p><p>Before the words left his mouth, three streaks of light shot forward—his three beast companions, lunging at Qin Sang.  Since Qin Sang had stopped fleeing, he wouldn't back down either.  Unless Qin Sang's escape techniques were exceptional, the celestial child was confident he could kill him, even without help.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>As the three beasts charged, three beams of multicolored light met them. The celestial child didn't dare confront the light directly, but after their prolonged struggle, he and his companions had devised a counter-strategy.</p><p>The three beasts' forms twisted, their movements unpredictable, leaving behind numerous afterimages. Simultaneously, a cascade of green light rained down—countless leaves, falling from above.</p><p>The leaves, vibrant and alive, were struck by the multicolored light; some solidified, others shattered, yet more leaves immediately followed.  In an instant, the multicolored light was swallowed by the endless leaves, then three figures burst forth from the leafy cover.</p><p>Protected by the leaves, the beasts had successfully avoided the attack, letting out excited roars.  Meanwhile, the celestial child secretly chanted incantations, repeatedly striking his Extinction Gourd. Qin Sang's decision to fight suited him perfectly; he only needed to partially focus on maintaining the gourd, allowing him to fully engage Qin Sang.</p><p>The Extinction Gourd slowly ascended, gradually fading until it vanished without a trace, yet the Nine-Turn Extinction Wind around them showed no signs of dissipating.</p><p>The celestial child patted his last remaining beast companion.  The beast, seemingly impatient, charged forward.</p><p>The celestial child then produced a jade bracelet, about to activate it, when he sensed a subtle disturbance behind him. A glimmer of happiness crossed his eyes.</p><p>"Brother Tang is finally here! The situation is resolved!"</p><p>The thought had barely crossed his mind when his expression changed abruptly.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Someone was parting the water, rapidly approaching. This aura was completely different from Brother Tang's, yet strangely familiar.</p><p>The celestial child spun around, his face a mask of disbelief.</p><p>"Were you awaiting me, friend?"</p><p>A long whistle echoed from behind, unmistakably Qin Sang's voice, laced with mockery and amusement.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's tone hardened.  "If you were waiting for *him*, there's no need..."</p><p>Before he finished, a stream of light pierced the water, falling before the celestial child – a mass of insect corpses.</p><p>Countless corpses, stinging the celestial child's eyes. Among them was not the green-robed man's primary insect; that one seemed only dismembered, but had in fact been pulverized by sword intent. However, several special insects were present – ones the green-robed man highly valued, considering them his "vital organs," the core of his power, second only to his primary insect.</p><p>The celestial child recognized two of them from their earlier discussion; these were undoubtedly the green-robed man's insects, undeniable proof.</p><p>The green-robed man's cultivation method was unique; man was insect, insect was man.</p><p>The insects were dead. Where was the man?</p><p>"Brother Tang!"</p><p>The celestial child trembled, never imagining he'd be met not with Brother Tang's secret technique, but countless corpses.</p><p>"Impossible! You…"</p><p>The sight was too shocking, the implication too terrifying!  He hadn't noticed his voice trembling, his expression revealing uncontainable horror.</p><p>"This brother died for another, a rather unhappy death, I'd say! Ah, and the previous brother too; the two of you can keep each other company on the road to the underworld..."</p><p>Qin Sang laughed uproariously, a wildly confident laugh.</p><p>In warfare, the best strategy is to attack the mind.  A seasoned veteran, he was well-versed in this art.  Normally, cultivators at the Void Refinement stage, hardened by years of experience, possess unyielding resolve, making psychological warfare ineffective. But this celestial child was clearly an exception.</p><p>"Too comfortable in the Sacred Grounds," Qin Sang mused.  Seeing how easily he'd shaken the celestial child's resolve, he pressed his advantage, summoning his Thunder Beast Guard.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A burst of lightning erupted from the river.  A figure emerged from the thunder, towering and majestic, radiating an overwhelmingly powerful aura, rivaling even a late-stage Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>The celestial child's pupils shrank to pinpricks, his heart filled with utter terror!</p>
