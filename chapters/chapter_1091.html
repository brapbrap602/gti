<h1>Chapter 1833: The Fiery Lotus Seed</h1><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>A dragon's roar shook the heavens.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang, at some point, revealed his true form, manifesting his dragon body.</p><p>Chains of demonic energy were embedded deeply in the dragon's body.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang hadn't been this disheveled in a long time. His incredibly powerful dragon body was easily wounded by Mo Qingzhu; those chains were sharper than any blade.</p><p>Scales shattered, blood flowed freely.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Jiao Long Wang erupted in golden light, all his scales shining brilliantly, resisting the demonic energy.</p><p>Some chains were broken or severed by the golden light, but countless more instantly surged forward, like malignant tumors, piercing into his flesh.</p><p>The demonic energy invaded, cutting his dragon scales, causing Jiao Long Wang to let out a pained groan.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang was frustrated. If Mo Qingzhu wasn't so fast, he wouldn't be in such a predicament.  He was forced to a dead end in an instant, and he fought back furiously, conjuring a golden dragon phantom.</p><p>This was an ancestral secret technique of the Jiao clan, one that Ling Zhuzi and the others had experienced firsthand. But seeing the golden dragon phantom emerge, Mo Qingzhu's blood-red eyes showed no fluctuation, his gaze icy as he clenched his fist.</p><p>Knowing he couldn't win, Jiao Long Wang struggled desperately, his dragon claws clutching the Sky Phoenix Feather, desperately trying to activate the treasure.</p><p>The blood-colored crystal wall was about to be pierced by the flames.</p><p>But Mo Qingzhu was too fast.  The golden dragon phantom, before it could fully form, was shredded by the demonic energy, shattering into pieces.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>Chains tightly bound Jiao Long Wang, twisting his body, dislocating his bones, and stagnating his true essence. The Sky Phoenix Feather dimmed.</p><p>The demonic energy and chains ghosted towards the dragon claw gripping the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu had seen through Jiao Long Wang's plan—he also wanted the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A loud bang.</p><p>The dragon claw's skin was ripped open, flesh separated from bone, undergoing unnatural twisting.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang could no longer control the treasure.</p><p>The flames extinguished.</p><p>The Sky Phoenix Feather fell from his grasp!</p><p>At this moment, the Sky Phoenix Feather became the focus of everyone's attention.</p><p>The Great Shaman, Fang Laomo, the Demon Lord, and Ling Zhuzi—four top experts whose strength was comparable to Jiao Long Wang—all pounced towards it.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi gently waved his whisk, transforming it into a sky full of stars, locking down a space. It was like a galaxy rushing forward, carrying a vast aura, a powerful Taoist technique.</p><p>The Demon Lord's true body merged with the Yin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light, like the waters of the underworld. He and Ling Zhuzi, from left and right, went straight for the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>The Great Shaman's body emitted thunderous sounds, his escape light like lightning, with a faint phantom of a green silkworm shadowing him, dyeing the lightning green.</p><p>The silkworm was the Great Shaman's life-bound insect Gu, a kind of spirit silkworm, not the ancient divine silkworm of the Wu tribe legends, but the Spring Thunder Silkworm, one of the top ten in the Wu Insect Rankings.</p><p>The Spring Thunder Silkworm chirped.</p><p>Those bolts of lightning were like the fine threads spun by the Spring Thunder Silkworm, no less impressive than the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>The least conspicuous was Fang Laomo.</p><p>He didn't take out any treasure, but simply transformed into a yellow light, rushing towards the Sky Phoenix Feather. Yet, he was even faster than the Great Shaman.</p><p>Their movements were like thunder, the entire space filled with various strange lights.</p><p>Qin Sang and the young girl hid in a corner, trembling.</p><p>He and Bai were silent, at a loss about their current situation. Mo Qingzhu and the ancient demon's soul shard were too powerful. Even if the Demon Lord and the others joined forces wholeheartedly, it was hard to say what their chances of victory were.</p><p>The appearance of the Sky Phoenix Feather was uncertain whether it was good or bad; those people clearly had other thoughts in mind.</p><p>Qin Sang was nervous, watching the center of the fight.</p><p>His peripheral vision caught sight of the high platform.</p><p>On the high platform, the blood coffin and the sword qi were locked in a stalemate, their aftershocks forming a terrifying storm; no one dared to approach.</p><p>He observed the situation using the Heavenly Eye Divine Ability, while searching his Qianjun Ring for any life-saving treasures.</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid could heal wounds.</p><p>But here, once anything happened, it would be death, so it probably wouldn't be much use.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed the lotus seed he obtained from Mou Laomo.</p><p>The lotus seed was transparent, like it was carved from crystal.</p><p>After Mou Laomo died, only this remained.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that this thing was originally hidden in the Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>It was an unknown treasure; even severely wounded, Old Man Mou hadn't abandoned it.</p><p>After obtaining the lotus seed, Qin Sang had wanted to examine it closely, but was interrupted by King Jiu Feng.</p><p>"I remember there's a secret technique…"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't do anything, so she summoned the lotus seed, used her spiritual sense to probe inside, and a look of surprise gradually appeared on her face.</p><p>"The Fire Seed Golden Lotus," she murmured, "It's an extraordinary fire-control secret technique!  It can subdue ownerless spirit flames, condense a fire seed within the Purple Mansion, and cultivate one's spiritual sense.  No wonder Old Man Mou, with his superior spiritual sense, managed to escape death! This lotus seed, similar to a bone flute, is the technique's carrier and aids cultivation, increasing the chances of success. There are imprints left by Old Man Mou inside, but since he's dead, with enough time, refining this shouldn't be difficult…"</p><p>…</p><p>The Sky Phoenix Feather fell.</p><p>King Jiao Long's eyes were bloodshot with rage.</p><p>But the power displayed by Mo Qingzhu filled him with even greater despair.</p><p>At that moment, the Demon Lord and others charged forward, their eyes fixated on the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a green light arrived even sooner.</p><p>The Demon-Subduing Stele, having saved the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, rushed to seize the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>But someone was even faster.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Demonic Qi swept up the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu suppressed King Jiao Long's resistance, a sneer flashing in his blood-red eyes, intending to claim the Sky Phoenix Feather and cut off everyone's escape route.</p><p>‘Buzz!’</p><p>Nan Gui Xianzi and her companion unleashed the full power of the Demon-Subduing Stele.</p><p>The Demonic Qi seethed, hissing and crackling.</p><p>The Demon-Subduing Stele, being a natural counter to ancient demons, tore through the Demonic Qi with its green light, like a sharp blade slicing through something fragile, and struck viciously at Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>However, Mo Qingzhu showed no fear. He waved his arm, and countless streams of Demonic Qi surged forth, forming layered barriers, relentlessly assaulting the stele's green light.</p><p>Even the Demon-Subduing Stele couldn't deter Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>Just as the Sky Phoenix Feather seemed about to fall into Mo Qingzhu's hands,</p><p>suddenly, a bloody light flickered in Mo Qingzhu's eyes. He roared in fury, "You dare!"</p><p>Immediately, Mo Qingzhu's aura fluctuated; the Demonic Qi within him turned unstable.</p><p>Within his body, Qingzhu's true spirit, which hadn't been devoured, had fused with his sword soul, merging with the fragments of the spirit sword.  Sheltered by this treasure, it stubbornly persevered, exerting its full strength at this critical moment to influence Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>"Chance!"</p><p>Seeing this, everyone inwardly shouted, filled with surprise.</p><p>They didn't understand how Qingzhu, with such a massive power disparity, managed this feat, but they wouldn't miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Demon-Subduing Stele shattered the Demonic Qi.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, seizing the moment, snatched the Sky Phoenix Feather and retreated under the cover of Nan Gui Xianzi and her companion.</p><p>The power difference was too great. Qingzhu's resistance was instantly crushed by the demon soul.</p><p>King Jiao Long also tried to escape, roaring wildly, desperately struggling, snapping one shackle after another.</p>
