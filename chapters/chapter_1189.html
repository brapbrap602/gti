<h1>Chapter 1181: Seeing Through</h1><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, we must not let our guard down. One of the reasons the Sin Abyss has been able to press us so relentlessly is precisely because of these Shadow Crystal Towers. These towers can be moved at will, yet they possess power comparable to spirit arrays, along with numerous other miraculous functions. This allows the Sin Abyss army to maneuver flexibly. The defensive arrays we’ve painstakingly set up, which should only be breached by an army several times our size or by them discovering the weak points of the array, are now far easier to break through because of the Shadow Crystal Towers…" Jing Lin warned.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information he had about the Shadow Crystal Towers. Back in the Demon Sea, he had experienced the demon race besieging the Great Desolate Island. Although he had managed to escape quickly, he had witnessed some of the human race’s methods, but none of them could compare to the Shadow Crystal Towers. These towers were undoubtedly a devastating weapon on the battlefield, which explained why the Sin Abyss had gained the upper hand. Even if the Two Domains Alliance had similar treasures, they were far inferior to the Shadow Crystal Towers.</p><p>"Did the Sin Abyss suddenly deploy these Shadow Crystal Towers after the last war? They didn’t have them before, did they?" Qin Sang asked carefully.</p><p>The Shadow Crystal Towers didn’t carry any demonic aura, so it was unclear whether they were related to the ancient demons. The Sin Abyss also had a secret realm like the Sin God Palace, which was said to contain many treasures. It was possible that the Sin Abyss had been fortunate enough to unearth the Shadow Crystal Towers from there.</p><p>Jing Lin was momentarily stunned, then remembered, "Ah! Fellow Daoist Mingyue, you’ve only recently advanced to the Transformation stage, so you probably weren’t paying attention to the conflicts between the three domains back then. In fact, even before the Purple Palace was ambushed, the Sin Abyss had been restless, repeatedly provoking us at the borders. We’ve clashed with them several times. Back then, they already had something similar to the Shadow Crystal Towers, but neither their power nor their numbers were comparable to what they have now. Over the years, the Sin Abyss must have made some breakthroughs or unearthed more materials…"</p><p>"Have you ever considered replicating this treasure?" Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>Jing Lin smiled bitterly, "Of course we’ve thought about it! Fellow Daoist Zhenyi and the Red-Haired Ancestor of the Cold Domain joined forces to set a trap, luring a Sin Abyss Nascent Soul cultivator into it and capturing him alive. After some interrogation, we learned that the method of refining the Shadow Crystal Towers is a top secret within the Sin Abyss, known only to a few besides the Old Demon Ye. We’ve also captured some Shadow Crystal Towers, but even now, we haven’t figured out what materials they’re made of, let alone how to replicate them."</p><p>The two communicated through divine sense, exchanging thoughts in mere moments.</p><p>As they spoke, the Sin Abyss forces were steadily advancing.</p><p>"Found him! That’s Old Demon Tan!" Jing Lin instinctively lowered his head and pointed out the location to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed a cultivator standing at the forefront of the Sin Abyss battle formation. This person was flying through the air, a red fire rope coiled around his left arm, and the surrounding cultivators all showed great reverence toward him.</p><p>"Old Demon Pei is hiding, but since he’s controlling the Shadow Crystal Towers, he won’t be too far from them," Jing Lin said as he secretly searched, but he couldn’t find Old Demon Pei’s figure.</p><p>Qin Sang was also searching.</p><p>At this moment, behind the Shadow Crystal Towers, two figures were hidden in the shadows, surrounded by a faint, almost imperceptible ripple, like a transparent veil enveloping them. Other cultivators passed by them, and the veil only trembled slightly, as if they were completely unaware of the two.</p><p>"With Daoist Chanling’s support this time, we’re sure to take the Threefold Pass!" one of them said confidently as he looked at the sea of mist ahead. This person was none other than Old Demon Pei, whom Jing Lin was searching for.</p><p>Beside him stood a lean Daoist. With his hands behind his back, the green veil was a treasure he was controlling, perfectly concealing their forms and auras within it.</p><p>After staring at the sea of mist for a moment, Old Demon Pei sneered, "It’s indeed that fellow Si Di who’s come out to face us. I’ve already mastered his divine abilities. Aside from his treasure, the Golden Mirror, the rest are nothing to worry about. This time, Fellow Daoist Tan has come up with some countermeasures. As long as we lure him over and strike at the right moment, we can at least severely injure him. Before their reinforcements arrive, we’ll take the Threefold Pass…"</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators of the Sin Abyss were actually harboring similar thoughts to Qin Sang and his allies.</p><p>"The Threefold Pass isn’t a particularly crucial location. It all depends on how Fellow Daoist Ye and the others fare in their battles… As long as the two of you are confident, that’s good enough," Daoist Chanling nodded slightly. "With three Shadow Crystal Towers here, they’ll surely know that Fellow Daoist Pei is also present. You might as well activate the Shadow Crystal Towers and attack directly to dispel Si Di and Jing Lin’s suspicions. I’ll hide under the Veil of No Light and sneak over."</p><p>Old Demon Tan expressed some concern, "They’re bound to hunker down in the Frost Bell Array and refuse to come out. If Daoist Chanling directly enters the Frost Bell Array, won’t the array’s controller detect you…"</p><p>Daoist Chanling smiled faintly, "My Veil of No Light is as gentle as water, excelling at flowing with the current and adapting to the situation. Even if I infiltrate the array, it won’t be easy to expose me. Unless someone’s divine sense surpasses mine, there’s no way they’ll detect my presence. However, I’ll need to focus entirely on controlling the Veil of No Light to achieve this effect, which will cause a slight delay when I strike. This is the flaw of the Veil of No Light, and it’s enough time for the opponent to react. That’s why I’ll need your and Fellow Daoist Tan’s close cooperation."</p><p>Hearing this, Old Demon Tan’s eyes lit up, "Daoist Chanling, you’re at the mid-Nascent Soul stage. Among the Two Domains Alliance, there are only a handful whose divine sense surpasses yours, and none of them are at the Threefold Pass!"</p><p>The two exchanged a few more words through divine sense.</p><p>Old Demon Tan’s figure flickered and vanished into thin air.</p><p>Daoist Chanling, like a ghost, drifted forward slowly with the Veil of No Light.</p><p>After flying for a while, Daoist Chanling seemed to sense something. His brow furrowed slightly as he gazed into the depths of the sea of mist. After a quick glance, he found nothing and shook his head lightly, continuing to follow the original plan.</p><p>Within the sea of mist, Qin Sang’s heart suddenly skipped a beat.</p><p>Daoist Chanling’s concealment technique was extraordinary, but it couldn’t escape the eyes of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>At a single glance, Qin Sang made an unexpected discovery!</p><p>As he carefully searched the battle formation, he not only found Old Demon Tan but also discovered this Daoist. His heart sank—the Sin Abyss had sent three Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>When he tried to have the Heavenly Eye Butterfly continue using its divine ability to get a clearer look at this person, he nearly alerted the Daoist. The other party’s divine sense was likely far superior to his own!</p><p>A sense of foreboding rose in Qin Sang’s heart.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Jing Lin…" Qin Sang’s expression turned grave as he immediately informed Jing Lin of the situation.</p><p>"What? Three Nascent Souls?" Jing Lin exclaimed. After hearing Qin Sang’s description, he immediately recalled someone. "It’s him! This person’s Daoist name is Chanling. He’s at the mid-Nascent Soul stage and possesses a rare concealment treasure. He’s caused us great trouble before, and we’ve never found a good way to deal with him. He’s usually active in the eastern city of Wangdong, but now he’s appeared here. It seems the Sin Abyss is planning to break through from our Stone Song Mountain!"</p><p>"Mid-Nascent Soul stage?" Qin Sang’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>He wasn’t panicked by the opponent’s cultivation level, but it was clear that Daoist Chanling was targeting Si Di, just as they had planned to do. In a direct confrontation, they wouldn’t have the advantage, and they might need to change their strategy.</p>
