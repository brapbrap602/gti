<h1>Chapter 858: Hunting the Monster</h1><p>The shopkeeper took his payment and left. Qin Sang discreetly observed the young man.  He was handsome, and his cultivation had already reached the late Core Formation stage. His aura was subtle and even more unfathomable than Yue Xiangu's. More importantly, there wasn't a trace of demonic energy about him. This meant he'd either already purged the demonic aura with a spiritual medicine or had achieved Core Formation without ever taking the Monster Core Pill.  Over the years, Qin Sang had rarely encountered Core Formation cultivators like this young man.  To resist the temptation of the Monster Core Pill required not only exceptional talent but also unwavering determination.  This young man's power must surely surpass others at his level.</p><p>"I'm entangled in some troublesome matters and can't go to Prosperity Island to meet you personally, Fellow Daoist. I could only trouble you to make the trip. I hope you don't mind," the young man, surnamed Fang, said, cupping his hands.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed easily. "Don't mention it, Fellow Daoist Fang. As long as the task is accomplished, a trip isn't a big deal for me."</p><p>"You're straightforward, Fellow Daoist Qin! Then I'll get straight to the point. I have an important matter and I'm seeking powerful assistance. The Fellow Daoist I previously invited encountered an unforeseen event and can't accompany me.  It just so happens that the shopkeeper highly recommended you..."</p><p>Fang explained his reasons, speaking eloquently. Qin Sang nodded silently, then glanced at the mountaintop. "May I ask how many others you've invited, Fellow Daoist Fang? Or is it just the two of us?"</p><p>Fang shook his head. "A few other Fellow Daoists are cultivating on the summit. They're the helpers I've invited and will join us. If you agree to assist, Fellow Daoist Qin, I'll introduce you."</p><p>"I am indeed interested," Qin Sang said gravely, "but I know nothing about your objective, making it difficult for me to make a decision."</p><p>Fang smiled.  "There's nothing to hide, actually. My objective is simple: I want to ask a few Fellow Daoists to help me hunt a monster."</p><p>"Hunt a monster?" Qin Sang was taken aback.  He frowned. "Are we going to the Demon Sea?"  The Demon Sea was currently a perilous place, and he'd barely escaped with his life. He had no desire to rush back into danger.</p><p>Fang shook his head. "Not the Demon Sea. That beast is in our Inner Sea. Everyone knows the situation in the Demon Sea. I wouldn't risk my life for a single monster."</p><p>*Not the Demon Sea, good.* Qin Sang was experienced in monster hunting. He had even participated in hunting a late Core Formation giant turtle.  His expression relaxed as he looked Fang up and down. "With your cultivation, ordinary monsters shouldn't pose a problem, right?  Is it a late Core Formation demon?" Such high-level demons weren't easy to find even in the Demon Sea.  Even if you encountered one, your first thought would be to escape, not to hunt it.  Surely there were many outside Great Waste Island now; the question was whether they had the ability to hunt them.  Demons with powerful bloodline abilities could even give Nascent Soul ancestors trouble. If Fang was targeting such a monster, it was no wonder he needed help.</p><p>"Indeed, the beast I'm targeting is a late Core Formation demon. It possesses unique talents and extraordinary powers, far surpassing ordinary demons. To ensure success, I've also prepared a spirit array.  The other Fellow Daoists are currently practicing the array's formations..."</p><p>When Qin Sang pressed for details, Fang refused to reveal the type of monster. "Don't ask anymore, Fellow Daoist Qin. I won't say until the very end," Fang said firmly. "This beast is incredibly rare. It carries a spiritual item I need for my cultivation. That's why I'm willing to pay such a high price to ask for your help.  After we succeed, the monster's remains belong to me. You're not to take a single thing!"</p><p>The reward Fang offered was disappointing: a single high-grade spirit stone.</p><p>"That monster is in the North Sea?  A round trip will probably take several months. For just one high-grade spirit stone…"  Qin Sang feigned hesitation.</p><p>Fang was displeased.  "It's just monster hunting. Fellow Daoist Qin, you only need to manage the array. How many spirit stones do you want?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Fang and said with a wry smile, "I need at least six more high-grade spirit stones."</p><p>"Six!" Fang frowned.  "Not only do I not have that many high-grade spirit stones, even if I did, I wouldn't spend that much on a single monster.  I've invited more than just you, Fellow Daoist. I'd be bankrupt if I paid everyone that much! How about this… I'm short-handed right now. If you cooperate fully in hunting this monster, I can give you one more as a gesture of goodwill."</p><p>*This guy seems quite wealthy!*  Qin Sang agreed without hesitation, simultaneously planning to build a good relationship with Fang.  *No need to bother finding someone else.*  He could trade another high-grade spirit stone with him, enough to refine the Ten Yama Envoys Banner.</p><p>After their agreement, the two flew to the summit together.  Arriving at a cave on the back of the mountain, Qin Sang felt a chill emanating from within. The aura of the cultivators he sensed earlier was inside the cave.  He glanced at Fang with surprise.</p><p>"I discovered this Ice Cave by accident. There's a cold pool inside," Fang said, leading him down.  "Using the cold energy from the pool, I refined the Glacial Wind Array..."</p><p>They quickly entered the ice cave, the cold intensifying as they descended, white mist swirling around them. After rounding several bends, a wide grotto appeared before them.  A pool of water at the center radiated intense cold but remained unfrozen.</p><p>Four individuals sat cross-legged around the edge of the pool, each holding a crystal tablet.  The four tablets were identical in appearance, their auras connected.  As they channeled their true essence into the tablets, a thick cold energy emanated, forming small swirling currents of frigid air that coalesced and dispersed.  They were practicing the array.  The formation required five people to be complete. Missing one, the formations' changes were significantly reduced.</p><p>The two remained silent, watching as they finished practicing the final stage.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze fell on a burly man with a curly beard, his expression changing slightly.  "Fellow Daoist Qiu?"</p><p>The four put away their tablets, and the burly man immediately stood up, striding over with a booming laugh.  "I didn't expect the final helper to be Fellow Daoist Qin! With you here, I'm relieved. A mere monster will be easily captured."</p><p>"You know each other? It seems I don't need to introduce you..." Fang watched them with a smile, his face betraying nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, discreetly avoiding the man's bear hug, and bowed his hands in greeting.  This man, surnamed Qiu, was also a rogue cultivator from Widow Mountain. He wielded powerful metal-based spells, and his cultivation was at the peak of the late Core Formation stage, on the verge of a breakthrough. Qin Sang had befriended him while cultivating on Widow Mountain.  They weren't particularly close, but Qiu had a naturally gregarious personality, seemingly friendly with everyone. Aside from Qiu, there was another face that looked familiar, someone he'd seen before but hadn't spoken to.</p><p>*"Fang wasn't lying. These are all cultivators recruited from Prosperity City."*  Qin Sang nodded to himself. </p>
