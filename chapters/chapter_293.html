<h1>Chapter 286 Three Bows and Nine Kowtows</h1><p>Chapter 286 Three Bows and Nine Kowtows</p><p>Yan Wu seized the opportunity to break free from the maelstrom's grasp, ultimately managing to enter the vortex at the last moment and escape danger.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Yu, for saving my life."</p><p>Despite his unrefined appearance, Yan Wu was grateful for the rescue, bowing deeply to Yu Kongxing with a face filled with gratitude, almost bursting into tears.</p><p>His reaction may have seemed excessive, but it was understandable considering his life had been saved.</p><p>After this incident, the others looked at Yu Kong with less hostility.</p><p>The words of Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi had more or less planted seeds of discord, but now most of them had dissipated. The atmosphere within the group had eased significantly.</p><p>Having finally passed through the formation without incident and entered the cave, everyone was relieved and quickly began to observe their surroundings.</p><p>The wind howled and the rain poured down.</p><p>The cold wind and rain were relentless, and even as cultivators, they found it difficult to endure. They activated their spiritual energy to protect themselves.</p><p>Curiously, when the raindrops fell on their bodies or the ground, they vanished as if they were illusions, yet they could still be clearly felt hitting their skin, causing a certain amount of damage.</p><p>The wind and raindrops were actually manifestations of chaotic spiritual energy. The entire cave was not filled with torrential rain; in other places, celestial fire descended or yellow sand filled the air.</p><p>All sorts of strange phenomena could be seen.</p><p>The intermingling of these phenomena obscured their vision, so that they could only make out the silhouette of a towering mountain ahead. They could not clearly see the people or buildings on the mountain. The most prominent feature was the Patriarch's Hall at the summit, but only the outline of an ancient temple could be discerned.</p><p>The mountain was rugged, like a sword piercing the heavens.</p><p>A stone staircase, clearly carved by humans, started from the foot of the mountain and extended to a point beyond their sight.</p><p>At this time, specks of light could be seen passing through the rain curtain in certain areas of the mountain. They were the flickering of escape lights, indicating that some people had already entered the cave and begun their search for treasures.</p><p>"These phenomena are caused by the leakage of power from the protective formation, creating this chaotic scene. Right now, the formation is at its weakest, so as long as you protect yourselves with spiritual energy, there shouldn't be any major problems. However, it's best to ascend the mountain on foot. Flying high up could easily cause you to be swept away by the chaotic spiritual energy, and it would be difficult to free yourself without some effort..."</p><p>Yu Kong was in no hurry to climb the mountain, instead repeating the precautions they needed to take in the cave and warning everyone. Then he turned and pointed behind them.</p><p>"Everyone, remember where we entered. Before the low point ends, the formation will not change significantly. If you leave from the point of origin, you will still encounter the same windstorm you came through. You are already familiar with the changes in the windstorm, and it's much easier to exit than to enter. There is no need to worry about being trapped in the formation."</p><p>Behind them was an expanse of misty clouds that formed a chaotic scene like a giant eye of the storm.</p><p>Everyone memorized the point of entry as instructed.</p><p>These were common knowledge after entering the cave. Yu Kong patiently reminded them to avoid any oversights.</p><p>"There are still a few fellow Daoists who have not responded to Yu," Yu Kong said, his gaze falling on the Xiu sisters, Elder Mu Teng, and the others. "Now that we have entered the cave, I wonder what your plans are. Will you follow Yu to the Spirit Treasure Pavilion behind the mountain, or will you act independently?"</p><p>Qin Sang had already accepted Yu Kong's invitation. He took a step forward and stood behind Yu Kong. Yan Wu followed without hesitation, and then上官利锋 did the same.</p><p>The others looked at each other, hesitating.</p><p>Elder Mu Teng coughed lightly and asked earnestly, "Fellow Daoist Yu, you said before that anyone who found a treasure in the Spirit Treasure Pavilion would keep it for themselves, and others would not be allowed to fight over it. But what if someone decides to take the treasure by force? What will Fellow Daoist Yu do?"</p><p>Yu Kong looked around and said calmly, "Yu will kill them together with the other fellow Daoists. I believe that the other fellow Daoists share Yu's contempt for such despicable behavior. If Yu were to violate this rule, the fellow Daoists need not hold back!"</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Mu Teng's eyes flickered. He nodded and walked over to Yu Kong.</p><p>Wu Chen struggled for a moment and followed suit.</p><p>There were three women left. Crescent Moon Fairy giggled and leaned over pitifully. "This humble servant is alone and helpless. To have the protection of Senior Yu and the support of the other fellow Daoists, I am overjoyed. How could I refuse?"</p><p>The Xiu sisters conferred for a while, then bowed to Yu Kong together. With a hint of apology, they said, "We sisters have a different destination,可惜不在后山, so we cannot accompany Senior Yu. We ask for your understanding."</p><p>Yu Kong was not offended. He extended his hand and said sincerely, "Yu said earlier that you are all free to come and go as you please. Fellow Daoists Xiu, please do as you wish. May you achieve your goals."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>The Xiu sisters bowed and left, disappearing into the rain under the watchful eyes of the others.</p><p>Yu Kong laughed. "Although we have lost two fellow Daoists, the power of the Returning Origin Formation has been greatly reduced. However, all of you are outstanding individuals. I am confident that you will return with a bountiful harvest. Let's ascend the mountain as soon as possible. Fellow Daoists, follow me."</p><p>As he spoke, Yu Kong's body flashed, and he charged into the rain. Everyone hurriedly raised their escape lights and followed closely behind him.</p><p>The stone steps were steep, and many places had been severely damaged, but this posed no obstacle to the celestial cultivators. Everyone trailed closely behind Yu Kong, speeding towards the mountain peak. Anyone they ran into on the way made way for them, and no one would have started a conflict here.</p><p>It didn't take long for everyone to reach the summit. Just when everyone thought Yu Kong was going to dash straight past the Great Temple of Offerings and towards the back mountain, Yu Kong instead walked straight up to the Great Temple of Offerings, striding inside.</p><p>This left everyone utterly astonished. They didn't know why he would stop at this place, which had already been confirmed to be a ruin.</p><p>The Great Temple of Offerings had already been turned upside down, and no one would have wasted time here. There wasn't a single person in the great temple.</p><p>Outside, a torrential downpour continued, and the ancient temple had been reduced to ruins.</p><p>The lone clay sculpture was crooked, as if someone had moved it from its original location. The colors on the sculpture had long since peeled away, revealing its age, but one could make out that it depicted a Taoist priest.</p><p>Yu Kong stood in the great temple, looking up at the crooked clay sculpture, his stance like that of a pilgrim.</p><p>Everyone else followed him inside.</p><p>Yu Kong looked at the clay sculpture and said with a laugh, "Fellow Daoist acolytes, you needn't be surprised. Yu here simply recalled something a friend once said, that one should always remember the kindnesses one has received. Yu here deeply agrees with this. I once acquired a spirit pill here that helped me break through the mid-stage. It's a pity that the master of these caves is long gone, and I don't know their name, so Yu has no way of repaying my debt. Now that I'm back at these caves, I'll come inside and pay my respects. It won't take much time."</p><p>As he said this, Yu Kong walked up to the clay sculpture, gently straightening it and brushing away the dust on it. Then he turned and came to a stop ten feet in front of it.</p><p>His feet were together, and his hands hung naturally at his sides.</p><p>His chin was tucked in, his tongue pressed against the back of his teeth, and his chest was out and his back straight.</p><p>After these gestures, Yu Kong actually performed three deep bows and nine kowtows towards the clay sculpture!</p><p>Everyone looked at each other, but when they saw Yu Kong's earnest expression, no one interrupted him.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and a strange feeling lingered in his heart. He couldn't tell whether Yu Kong was sincere or whether his loyalty masked a deep treachery!</p>
