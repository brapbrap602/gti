<h1>Chapter 1812: The Poison God Canon</h1><p>Entering this place, Qin Sang encountered all sorts of strangeness.</p><p>The Jade White Elder appeared to be just an ordinary statue.</p><p>Yet, a black skeleton knelt before it, prostrating itself in utter devotion.</p><p>The black skeleton being able to enter here meant its cultivation before death couldn't have been weak.</p><p>A cultivator of no small power, so devout, was either controlled or this place truly housed a deity.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly vigilant, calmly surveying the mountain cave, and discovered a brocade pouch beneath the black skeleton.</p><p>The pouch's vibrant colors suggested it was a treasure.</p><p>Apart from this, he found no other magical tools or jade slips. The pouch might be a Mustard Seed-type spatial artifact.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed the skeleton's unnatural posture, twisted and broken in several places, indicating severe injuries before death.</p><p>He immediately thought of the broken bones outside the stone gate. This skeleton was complete; the broken bones must belong to someone else. A fight had taken place here.</p><p>"Internal strife or external enemies?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>The restriction on the hidden door could block Hua Ling's perception, but it was unclear whether it could withstand evil ghosts.</p><p>They might have been attacked by evil ghosts before death, or perhaps they killed each other.</p><p>The corpse had turned to bone, indicating a long time had passed since death. This place was littered with white bones, and no useful traces could be found.</p><p>However, these discoveries were enough to put Qin Sang on guard. The Jade White Elder, the evil ghosts of unknown origin, and possibly even an evil ghost nest, everything seemed so unusual.</p><p>"The world has Daoist Heavenly Gods, Demon Gods, and naturally, Evil Gods..."</p><p>Qin Sang took one last look at the Jade White Elder, pondered for a moment, and slowly retreated.</p><p>He returned behind the stone gate and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Choosing not to step into the cave or probe the Jade White Elder with his divine sense, nor take the pouch, Qin Sang worried that rash actions would invite trouble, putting him in a perilous situation, beset on all sides.</p><p>His current condition was poor. He urgently needed to address the accumulated toxins within his body. Since there was no immediate danger, he should heal his injuries and recover his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>The mountain's interior was tranquil, like a different world from the outside.</p><p>During this time, the stone gate remained stable, confirming that Hua Ling wouldn't force her way in.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to stand guard, mainly wary not of the Hua Ling outside, but of the statue within.</p><p>He focused his mind and circulated the Poison Pearl, refining the potent toxins within his body.</p><p>After careful discernment, Qin Sang found the connections between these virulent poisons. The poison in the poisonous water, the poisonous restriction on the seventh archway of the palace, the evil ghost's poison, and even the restriction on the hidden door, all had intricate links to the flower poison in the flower fields.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the hidden door used flower poison for its restriction, which was why it could isolate Hua Ling's perception.</p><p>This showed that the White Bone Flower Field was the foundation of this poisonous domain.</p><p>The flower poison in the field, infused with the Hua Ling's resentment, was even more potent. If handled carelessly, allowing the resentful poison to invade one's mind, it would be a significant problem.</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, didn't fear these, treating them as normal potent toxins. With the situation unclear and wanting to recover quickly, he didn't attempt to have the Poison Pearl absorb them, instead circulating the Poison Dispelling Radiant Light to expel them.</p><p>Soon, a faint black qi emanated from Qin Sang's skin, followed by flickering multicolored lights, as threads of poisonous qi were expelled.</p><p>These poisonous qi drifted towards Qin Sang's chest, confined by a layer of Poison Dispelling Radiant Light, unable to disperse.</p><p>Gradually, the potent toxins expelled from his body lessened, and Qin Sang's complexion finally returned to normal. He exhaled a long breath of turbid air and slowly regained consciousness.</p><p>Divine light shone in his eyes, seemingly fully recovered!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the poisonous qi before him, his palm closing as if grasping air, compressing the poisonous qi into a bead. However, its color was mottled, far less pure than the orbs within the evil ghosts.</p><p>He casually stored it in the Thousand Jun Ring, glanced at the hidden door, and walked towards the interior of the cave.</p><p>The Jade White Elder remained as before, standing at the altar, without any unusual changes.</p><p>Qin Sang, now emboldened, scrutinized the Jade White Elder, his gaze finally landing on the brocade pouch. With a gesture, the pouch flew into his hand.</p><p>As expected, it was a Mustard Seed-type spatial artifact.</p><p>The previous owner hadn't placed any special restrictions on the pouch, saving Qin Sang some effort.</p><p>Opening the pouch, its contents were revealed.</p><p>After careful examination, Qin Sang gradually frowned.</p><p>The pouch mostly contained trivial items, not what Qin Sang had anticipated. He didn't find anything to prove the black skeleton's identity, nor any jade slips or the like, making it impossible to determine its origins through cultivation techniques or secret arts.</p><p>He could only conclude that this person was highly skilled in the Dao of Poisons.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no records related to the flower fields, so he still had to find his own way out.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Jade White Elder, pondered for a moment, and decided to go outside first.</p><p>The reason for his eagerness to leave was twofold: first, to understand this space thoroughly, and second, to find Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren.</p><p>If the two True Masters had also fallen into the flower fields and couldn't leave, they would be nearing their limit.</p><p>They had explored this place multiple times and must know some unknown secrets, perhaps even the origin of the flower fields and the way out.</p><p>Qin Sang always planned his escape route first. After securing a retreat, he would investigate the Jade White Elder. If anything went wrong, he could escape in time.</p><p>There was another reason for his caution.</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed the flower poison, but he couldn't connect it to the strange poison that killed several True Lineage disciples of Lou Gu Mountain, indicating other hidden dangers.</p><p>He quickly returned to the door, his palm touching the stone gate. While detoxifying earlier, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had clearly observed the network of restrictions on the stone gate, imprinting it in his mind.</p><p>With a flash of light, Qin Sang appeared outside the stone gate.</p><p>The flower field, which had become peaceful, immediately stirred. Hua Ling and the clouds of resentful poison surged forth, frantically pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>Flying into the sky, he surveyed the surroundings. There were no unusual signs amidst the towering peaks. Qin Sang then used his Thunder Escape, soaring over the mountains and ridges, unexpectedly returning to the deepest part of the flower field.</p><p>The two flower fields in the deepest part corresponded to two main halls. Qin Sang had previously fallen into the left flower field; now he was going to the other one.</p><p>Swordsmanship and thunder arts were unleashed, clearing a path.</p><p>Delicate and enchanting flowers, piles of white bones, came into view. The bones in this flower field were pure white, of excellent quality.</p><p>Countless Hua Ling rushed towards him. There were no evil ghosts, and he also couldn't find the two True Masters.</p><p>He wondered if Hua Ling devoured flesh and blood. If the two True Masters had perished here, they might have already turned into white bones.</p><p>His divine sense swept across the entire flower field, finding no trace of the two True Masters' belongings.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly stared at the area behind the flower field. According to the layout of the palace, there shouldn't be any flower fields there, only mountains and ridges within his vision.</p><p>Now, however, Qin Sang noticed something unusual there.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal reappeared, killing the Hua Ling. Qin Sang flew higher, seeing clearly.</p><p>Directly behind the two flower fields, several mountain peaks were noticeably darker than other areas, as if shrouded in a gray curtain, shadowy and indistinct, eerily strange.</p><p>Looking closer, Qin Sang felt a shiver down his spine.</p><p>At his level of cultivation, his spiritual sense was so acute that illusions were almost impossible. There was only one possibility: that place was extremely dangerous!</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of personally investigating. He decisively withdrew from the flower field, speeding outwards, flying past flower field after flower field, arriving at the location corresponding to the palace gates.</p><p>The result was disappointing. Qin Sang couldn't find a way out here, nor could he find the two True Masters.</p><p>He continued to fly outwards. This space was larger than imagined, but eventually, Qin Sang reached the edge of the mountains.</p><p>The edge of the space, like the sky, was sealed by a distorting force.</p><p>His search fruitless, and with a large amount of flower poison accumulating within his body again, Qin Sang had to return to the cave.</p><p>Having lost their target, the Hua Ling dispersed, returning to their flower cocoons to slumber.</p><p>The place gradually returned to normal, but a lingering sense of death permeated the entire space.</p><p>Before Qin Sang's intrusion, this space had always been like this, lasting for who knows how many years. Even the Hua Ling's dance couldn't erase that sense of death.</p><p>Stroking the stone gate, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Then, his fingers flickered, sending streams of hand seals into the stone gate, merging with the poison restriction, bringing it under his control.</p><p>This wouldn't change the power of the poison restriction, but it would allow Qin Sang to manipulate it more easily and observe the outside world through it.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flew out of his Qi Sea, circled Qin Sang, and then merged into the restriction with a flash, capturing the entire sky within its view.</p><p>Qin Sang once again sat cross-legged behind the stone gate, his mind connected to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, detoxifying himself while observing the force sealing the space.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang finally noticed something!</p><p>His Heavenly Eye divine ability locked onto a certain point in the sky. Qin Sang furrowed his brow, seemingly engrossed in deducing something.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang's brow relaxed.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, beyond that point should be a Mist Cluster, one of the passages out of this space!</p><p>Knowing the method of escape, Qin Sang's expression softened. He still had the Heaven's Eye Butterfly observe the outside while he entered the mountain cave for the third time.</p><p>This time, without hesitation, Qin Sang extended a strand of divine sense directly towards the Jade White Elder.</p><p>A moment later, a look of surprise appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>His divine sense entered the white jade and discovered it wasn't a statue, nor was it ordinary. It was like a jade slip, containing a hidden scripture!</p><p>Breaking the seal, profound scriptures instantly appeared in Qin Sang's mind, titled "The Poison God Canon"!</p><p>Judging by the name, it seemed to be a sacred text of the Dao of Poisons.</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang immediately began to study it carefully. Halfway through, he gasped, his eyes filled with shock, murmuring, "The flower field was actually artificially created, a fertile field for cultivating poison! White bones as fertilizer, collecting the dew of the poison flowers..."</p><p>Just then, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly suddenly transmitted a thought. Qin Sang withdrew his attention and "saw" the scene outside the mountain through the butterfly.</p><p>At this moment, at a certain point in the sky, the distorting force fluctuated abnormally, forming a whirlwind high above.</p><p>This was an external force.</p><p>However, the whirlwind was distorted and struggled to take shape. It was evident that this force was trying to break through the sky but couldn't penetrate the distorting force, only managing to maintain the whirlwind.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately understood. It was likely the two True Masters outside, attempting to rescue him.</p><p>So they had already escaped.</p><p>This was indeed the case. Qing Dan Yuanjun had explored the poisonous domain many times. Although she didn't know the truth about it, she had discovered some signs and secrets, but only understood when the palace transformed.</p><p>However, although they had escaped danger, they were also seriously injured. Suppressing the potent poison within their bodies, they hastily recovered some strength, found a Mist Cluster, and attempted to rescue Qin Sang.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang was still alive and saw the celestial phenomenon, working together from inside and outside, there was a chance of escape.</p><p>"They are trustworthy people."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly.</p><p>In this world's Daoist sect, there were demons and devils lurking outside, but the internal order was well-maintained. Demonic beasts and ferocious beasts were endless, unlike the resource-scarce Storm Realm. Most of the Daoist cultivators he encountered cultivated both body and mind, upholding righteousness.</p><p>There was even a saying circulating within the Daoist sect: "If one cultivates for longevity, one must first accumulate deeds and merits. With merit but no deeds, Dao fruition is difficult. Merit and deeds together make a True Master."</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't respond to the two True Masters. This "Poison God Canon" had broadened his horizons, and he was reluctant to leave just yet.</p><p>"Since they are already safe, there's no need to go out and meet them for now. I'll think of an excuse later..."</p><p>The spirit array of this space was recorded in the "Poison God Canon." Those who didn't understand spirit arrays could only enter and exit the flower fields through the sole entrance, the spirit tree in the palace.</p><p>The palace was a facade, a deception.</p><p>The palace originally had restrictions hiding the spirit tree. Perhaps due to the passage of time, and being within the constantly shifting Altar of Order, the spirit array was damaged, causing the spirit tree to appear, and even some parts of the flower fields to be projected into reality, forming the Mist Clusters.</p><p>The three of them hadn't understood the situation before. Qing Dan Yuanjun uprooting the spirit tree destroyed the entrance, causing the palace to collapse, leaving behind the terrifying sight of distorted void, which intensified.</p><p>Even through the Mist Clusters, it was easier to go out than to come in.</p><p>The whirlwind in the sky lasted for a while before finally dissipating. The two True Masters received no response, assuming Qin Sang was most likely dead, and could only leave the poisonous domain to neutralize the poison within their bodies.</p><p>Qin Sang was now completely absorbed in studying the "Poison God Canon."</p><p>At first, he was only shocked by the origin of the White Bone Flower Field.</p><p>As he read through the entire "Poison God Canon," he was immediately stunned by the profound methods within.</p><p>Undoubtedly, this was a sacred text of the Dao of Poisons, a superior inheritance, likely not originating from the Daoist sect, because the "Poison God Canon" didn't mention any cultivation arts.</p><p>It was impossible to tell what cultivation art the black skeleton had practiced before death.</p><p>The Daoist sect likely wouldn't have such a sinister method of piling corpses into fields and using white bones to cultivate poison.</p><p>It was certain that the black skeleton had cultivated the "Poison God Canon" before death.</p><p>Qin Sang took out two jade slips, the poison refining body secret art he had obtained from Qing Dan Yuanjun.</p><p>This secret art originated from the "Poison God Canon," but it was only a part of the inheritance, and not the core, a special secret art specifically used to aid cultivation.</p><p>The "Poison God Canon" was even more extreme. Its core method was to introduce poison into the body, refine poison into essence, and cultivate poisonous essence to rapidly increase cultivation.</p><p>The White Bone Flower Field was a medicinal field. The Hua Ling weren't spiritual beings, but a rare type of poisonous flower, whose dew was a superior poison, one of the most suitable poisons for cultivating poisonous essence!</p><p>Cultivating with potent poison, the dangers were unimaginable.</p><p>During cultivation, residual poison would inevitably accumulate within the body. As the potent poison accumulated and became uncontrollable, death from poison eruption was inevitable.</p><p>Thus, there was the poison tempering body secret art, using the residual poison to temper the physical body. First, to clear the residual poison, and second, to strengthen the physical body, increasing one's resistance to potent poison, achieving an alternative form of dual cultivation of body and art.</p><p>However, this was still like drinking poison to quench thirst, unable to truly solve the hidden danger. While cultivation increased, the root of the potent poison remained. Once cultivation began, it couldn't be stopped, or the potent poison would immediately erupt.</p><p>Unless, before the poison erupted, one's cultivation or physical body broke through to a higher realm, there was a chance of survival.</p><p>Cultivating this method was like racing against the poison within one's body.</p><p>Used properly, it was a wondrous art; otherwise, it was a path to self-destruction. This black skeleton was a vivid example!</p>
