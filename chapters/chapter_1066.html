<h1>Chapter 1587: The Demon King Arrives</h1><p>“The Inner and Outer Halls are connected within the Immortal Restriction? This might not be as simple as just the Inner Hall's restriction, but rather connected to the entire Seven Kills Hall's formation.”</p><p>Qin Sang speculated.</p><p>Although he saw the shadow of the Celestial Tower, he didn't dare to move from his spot.</p><p>Not only was the surrounding area filled with dangerous shimmering light, but the surrounding vital energy was also incredibly chaotic. Qin Sang suspected that if he stepped outside the corridor, he would instantly be reduced to ashes.</p><p>“The ancient teleportation formation is most likely here, but I don't know its exact location. If I could pinpoint it and find the path to the past, I wouldn't have to ask Senior Qingzhu for help.”</p><p>Back on the eighth floor of the Celestial Tower, the demonic soul clearly had the upper hand. Senior Qingzhu didn't dare to reveal any secrets and couldn't leave any messages.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui had only refined one Nascent Soul; could she really help Senior Qingzhu suppress the demonic soul?</p><p>Qin Sang was very doubtful.</p><p>If he could help Senior Qingzhu recover, Qin Sang would naturally be happy to do so. He was still cultivating the Killing Talismans that Senior Qingzhu had comprehended, essentially inheriting his legacy.</p><p>Befriending Senior Qingzhu would only benefit him, and it would be even better if they could return to the Small Cold Realm together.</p><p>But what if Senior Qingzhu failed to suppress the demonic soul and he was caught in the crossfire?</p><p>It all depended on what safeguards Senior Qingzhu had put in place.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around but didn't see any other white jade corridors, only the one beneath his feet.</p><p>At this moment, Ning Wu Hui called out and walked towards the depths of the white jade corridor. Qin Sang put aside his distracting thoughts and quickly followed.</p><p>…</p><p>Deep within the secluded valley.</p><p>A group was traversing the mountains and valleys.</p><p>The Demon Kings each used their own methods to resist the intense poison.</p><p>When they first entered the valley through the mountain path, they were faced with a vast desert. Following the Dragon King's intuition, they continued onward, the terrain began to change, and they entered the deep mountains.</p><p>A phantom tortoise appeared on the back of the heavily armored man. Inside the phantom, it was like a small world. The phantom tortoise floated out, extended its long neck, looked towards the sky, and its mouth puffed in and out, absorbing and exhaling.</p><p>With each breath, it expelled a peculiar aura.</p><p>The aura rushed out of the tortoise shell, transforming into a stream of water, eventually forming a water shield that blocked the intense poison. However, the shield was also tainted by the poison, with wisps of black energy seeping in.</p><p>Two Demon Kings, recently recovered from serious injuries, stayed close to the heavily armored man, taking shelter under the water shield to quickly recuperate.</p><p>The Dragon King appeared much more at ease. His body shimmered with golden light, as if cast in gold.  A sizzling sound came from the edges of the golden light, as the intense poison was burned away before it could approach.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King followed the Dragon King, and some of the golden light also fell upon her.</p><p>“We're heading out of the valley, right?  It's strange, the further out we go, the more potent the poison becomes.”</p><p>The heavily armored man formed a hand seal, and the phantom tortoise's breathing quickened, thickening the water shield.</p><p>He grumbled with some impatience.</p><p>“There isn't much information available about this valley. I see Brother Hei is handling it with ease, so there's no need to worry.  The poison's power is finite. I can sense we're getting closer to the True Dragon's remains.”</p><p>The Dragon King clutched the dragon bone in his hand, his tone tinged with excitement.</p><p>The greatest danger within the valley came from the colorless and odorless intense poison, but compared to the other side of the mountains, it was insignificant.  They were all transformed Great Demons.  After entering the valley, even if they encountered ferocious beasts seeking trouble, they could quickly dispatch them, and their numbers hadn't dwindled.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the Demon Kings decided to increase their pace.</p><p>The Dragon King and the Nine Phoenix King led the way, with the heavily armored man bringing up the rear, as they swiftly moved through the mountains.  After crossing countless ridges, the shadow of a towering peak suddenly came into view.</p><p>The Dragon King abruptly stopped, his gaze fixed on the peak, his expression flickering.</p><p>“This mountain!”</p><p>The heavily armored man was startled.</p><p>After entering the Seven Kills Hall, including both the Inner and Outer Halls, there was no shortage of magnificent peaks reaching into the Immortal Restriction, their summits encircled by shimmering light, but this was the first time they had seen such a majestic peak.</p><p>The heavily armored man suddenly remembered something and said in surprise, “Could this be the legendary Sky-Leaning Peak? If I remember correctly, near Sky-Leaning Peak, there's a strange area called the Spirit Suppression Domain. It's said to be extremely dangerous, and the human cultivators avoid it like the plague… Could the dragon's remains be there?”</p><p>The Dragon King smiled wryly. “Brother Hei, you guessed right.  The secret technique points to the vicinity of Sky-Leaning Peak.”</p><p>The Demon Kings exchanged glances.</p><p>Cultivators had occupied the Seven Kills Hall for so many years, and among them were numerous outstanding individuals, including Nascent Soul Late Stage Grand Cultivators.  So many powerful predecessors were wary of Sky-Leaning Peak and the Spirit Suppression Domain, there had to be a reason.</p><p>They knew far less about Sky-Leaning Peak than the cultivators.  Rushing in rashly could have dire consequences.</p><p>“Having come this far with great difficulty, how can we give up? The restrictions that stump cultivators may not be insurmountable for us. Cultivators can only enter through the main gate, but we can utilize the Nine Phoenix King and the True Phoenix Feather, as evidenced by our presence here.  If this is truly the Dragon Burial Ground, Sky-Leaning Peak might be the cave dwelling of our demon ancestors…”</p><p>The Dragon King said in a deep voice.  Before he finished speaking, his figure flickered as he sped towards Sky-Leaning Peak.</p><p>The other Demon Kings silently followed.</p><p>They wouldn't be willing to give up now.</p><p>Sky-Leaning Peak drew closer.</p><p>The Demon Kings restrained their auras and moved cautiously to avoid being discovered by cultivators.</p><p>“As expected of Sky-Leaning Peak, even Mount Wushen, known as the highest peak in the Boundless Sea, pales in comparison!”</p><p>One Demon King exclaimed. He had once infiltrated the Wushen Continent and observed Mount Wushen.</p><p>Sky-Leaning Peak was like a colossal pillar supporting the sky.</p><p>Mist obscured their vision, preventing them from seeing the full view, but for some reason, when they looked up at this mountain, they felt a certain grandeur that other peaks lacked, and couldn't help but sigh at their own insignificance.</p><p>Ancient halls and pavilions, wondrous peaks and cliffs, were hidden within the dense forests.</p><p>However, the valley was deathly silent, all the plants had turned to stone, and Sky-Leaning Peak was likely no exception.</p><p>After traveling for a while longer, the Dragon King, having just crossed a mountain, seemed to have discovered something. He abruptly waved his hand, signaling them to stop.</p><p>“Something's strange ahead.”</p><p>The Dragon King said gravely.</p><p>The Demon Kings approached and faintly sensed a peculiar fluctuation pervading the air ahead, something they had never encountered before.</p><p>“The Spirit Suppression Domain.”</p><p>The heavily armored man asserted, “There's no mistaking it.  With Sky-Leaning Peak at its center, one more step forward will lead into the Spirit Suppression Domain.  I didn't expect it to be this large!”</p><p>At this point, several mountain ranges and a stone forest still separated them from Sky-Leaning Peak.</p><p>Only when they got closer did they realize that Sky-Leaning Peak wasn't a solitary, sharp peak, but rather a vast and majestic mountain, like a giant wall blocking their path and their view.</p><p>Unexpectedly, both the Spirit Suppression Domain and Sky-Leaning Peak were incredibly calm. Aside from the inexplicable restrictive fluctuations, there were no visible dangers.</p><p>“Spirit Suppression Domain… I'd like to see what makes the cultivators so afraid.”</p><p>The Dragon King observed for a moment, finding nothing.  With a cold laugh, his golden light transformed into a suit of golden armor. Holding his dragon spear, he was about to enter when the Nine Phoenix King stopped him.</p>
