<h1>Chapter 1297: Valley City</h1><p>The old Taoist Zhenyi turned his head to look at Qingjun and shook his head, saying, "I am also unaware of these matters. I received this intelligence less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea before all of you arrived."</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances.</p><p>"Let's assume the intelligence is genuine and not a trap. The old demon Ye is cunning and ruthless. He wouldn't act without reason. Has anyone recently fought against him and noticed anything unusual?"</p><p>Tongyou, the Demon Lord, stood up and scanned the crowd.</p><p>Everyone shook their heads.</p><p>At this moment, a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Tianxing Alliance stepped forward and said in a deep voice, "If we're talking about recent major events, it would have to be the Battle of the Blood Lake. Let's not forget that although the old demon Ye lost an avatar in the Blood Lake, he obtained a Jade Bone! I recall you all mentioned that the Jade Bone was ultimately taken away by the old demon Ye himself."</p><p>"Are you suggesting that the old demon Ye was influenced by the Jade Bone...?"</p><p>This was the only explanation that made sense for the old demon Ye's sudden change in temperament.</p><p>Tongyou, the Demon Lord, was taken aback and turned to look at Qingjun.</p><p>Among everyone present, Qingjun was the only one who had been in close contact with the Jade Bone and its brocade skin.</p><p>Qingjun understood their implication. Her gaze remained calm as she spoke with composure, "The consciousness within the Jade Bone and its brocade skin has undoubtedly perished. If there were any lingering remnants of a soul, it would not have escaped my perception! Everyone, do not overestimate the ancient cultivators, nor underestimate the old demon Ye. Do you think the old demon Ye would be so unprepared? Even if that person were truly alive, they would be nothing more than a withered, wandering ghost. The idea of them possessing or controlling the old demon Ye is almost impossible."</p><p>Upon hearing Qingjun's words, Qin Sang was inwardly astonished, admiring his senior sister's boldness in treating the ancient cultivators as nothing more than dirt.</p><p>Upon further reflection, Qin Sang realized that his senior sister was well-versed in the art of puppetry, and her spiritual sense was undoubtedly strong. She must possess unique techniques for dealing with souls, which gave her the confidence to speak so boldly.</p><p>The group began to speculate from other angles. "Could it be that the old demon Ye deciphered the secrets of the Jade Bone and obtained some kind of secret technique or treasure, and now wants to keep it all for himself?"</p><p>At this moment, Lady Luo suddenly spoke up, her voice carrying a hint of allure as she lazily said, "Why are you all so certain that the old demon Ye initiated this betrayal? Why not consider the opposite? The old demon Ye has always been domineering and cruel, and he has made countless enemies within the Sin Abyss. Those people have been intimidated by his strength and dared not act against him. But recently, he lost his Blood Demon avatar and was injured by Taoist Zhenyi. Isn't this the perfect opportunity to deal with him?"</p><p>For a moment, opinions varied widely.</p><p>Taoist Zhenyi remained silent, listening to the discussions. After a while, he spoke up, "In my humble opinion, even if there's a fifty percent chance this is a trap, it's still worth the risk. Opportunities like this are rare and fleeting. We cannot sit idly by waiting for more intelligence! Mobilizing the army would take too long, but with our speed, we might be able to reach Valley City before the Sin Abyss can quell the chaos!"</p><p>With the Sin Abyss embroiled in internal strife and unable to focus on external threats, if all the Nascent Soul cultivators acted together, there might indeed be a chance.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance naturally followed Taoist Zhenyi's lead.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators from the Xiaohan Domain were hesitant but also greatly tempted.</p><p>The benefits of capturing Valley City were self-evident.</p><p>"This is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! With the Saint Lord, Fellow Daoist Leng, and Fellow Daoist Qin here, as long as we remain vigilant, we can retreat unscathed even if something strange happens. Whether the intelligence is true or false will become clear once we reach Valley City," Xiang Qing spoke up, expressing confidence in the strength of the Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qingjun exchanged glances.</p><p>Whether to act or not, in Qin Sang's view, was a toss-up.</p><p>After this battle, he would have accomplished most of what he needed to do. He had no deep-seated hatred for the Sin Abyss and no urgent desire to destroy them.</p><p>However, if they could capture Valley City and force the Sin Abyss to negotiate, the benefits would be obvious.</p><p>In the future, he would need rare spiritual materials to forge a flying sword to replace the Ebony Sword and to refine a treasure capable of subduing the South Ming Li Fire. Perhaps he could obtain these from the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Qingjun gave a slight nod, and seeing this, Qin Sang also spoke up, agreeing to the plan.</p><p>The group quickly reached a consensus.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Taoist Zhenyi stood up abruptly, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes. "Since everyone agrees, we will set off for Valley City immediately. However, before we leave this hall, I must make something clear. Once we step outside, no one is to leave the sight of the others. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p><p>Everyone felt a chill and quickly voiced their agreement. None of them wanted a spy to leak their movements.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators left Caishi City in complete secrecy, with the army in the city remaining unaware.</p><p>In the wilderness.</p><p>Under the cover of Taoist Zhenyi's concealment treasure, they headed straight for Valley City.</p><p>As they drew closer to the Sin Abyss, the landscape of the plains began to change. Scattered low hills appeared at first, gradually forming a continuous range of mountains.</p><p>The peaks grew taller and more treacherous.</p><p>Along the way, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly remained vigilant, and Qingjun also used secret techniques to probe their surroundings, but nothing unusual was detected.</p><p>Halfway through their journey, Tongyou, the Demon Lord, let out a soft exclamation and suddenly requested a change in direction.</p><p>After flying a short distance, Tongyou waved his hand to signal a stop. He materialized in mid-air and looked down at a patch of grass, shouting, "Come out!"</p><p>"Saint Lord!"</p><p>A surprised voice came from the grass, and a figure emerged. It was a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>He wore a Taoist robe embroidered with special cloud patterns, and a jade pendant with similar designs hung from his waist. He was a disciple of the Hanyun Sect of the Sin Abyss. However, his attitude toward Tongyou, the Demon Lord, clearly indicated something was amiss.</p><p>"Why aren't you in Valley City? What are you doing here?"</p><p>Tongyou, the Demon Lord, asked with a commanding presence, his voice deep and stern.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivator's heart tightened, and he dared not hide anything. He quickly replied, "Reporting to the Saint Lord, the Nascent Soul cultivators are engaged in internal strife, and Valley City is in chaos. The city has been sealed. I managed to find a way out before the city was locked down and was on my way to report to you..."</p><p>This matched the intelligence Taoist Zhenyi had received!</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators exchanged glances and quickly revealed themselves to press for more details.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivator was terrified to suddenly see so many Nascent Soul ancestors. He spilled everything he knew. He had fled the city when he sensed trouble and, although he had brought back the news in time, he was unaware of the reasons behind the chaos.</p><p>"You're quite clever. Well done."</p><p>Tongyou, the Demon Lord, praised him and took him along as they continued their journey.</p><p>...</p><p>"We're not far from Valley City now."</p><p>On a mountain peak, a group of figures appeared. It was Qin Sang and the others, who had infiltrated this far. They had bypassed the Sin Abyss's outposts and quietly made their way here, now very close to Valley City.</p><p>Ahead of them, the ground was marked by small, winding cracks, and the mountains were also riddled with fissures.</p><p>This place was the northern end of the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>However, the cracks here looked no different from ordinary ones, with no ancient restrictions or secret realms inside.</p><p>According to their earlier speculation, the Abyssal Ruins had fallen into the heart of the Sin Abyss, creating the Heavenly Scar, and the aftershocks had spread here, forming this landscape.</p><p>"They must have set up defenses here. It's almost impossible to approach Valley City without being detected. We might as well charge in directly, catching them off guard and storming Valley City!"</p><p>Someone proposed.</p>
