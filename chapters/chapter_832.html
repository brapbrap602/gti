<h1>Chapter 824: Farewell</h1><p>The bluefin shark sank beneath the waves and vanished.</p><p>The survivors aboard the ship clung to life, only after a long while daring to believe that the shark was truly gone, that they had actually lived.  It felt like a dream.</p><p>The two surviving cultivators, including the middle-aged man, were utterly exhausted.</p><p>He had been consumed by despair, the sudden turn of events utterly unbelievable. Never before had he heard of a monster willingly abandoning its prey.</p><p>He rushed to the bow, scanning the ocean. The bluefin shark was nowhere to be seen, no bubbles disturbed the surface, and the monstrous aura had completely dissipated.</p><p>Relieved, the middle-aged cultivator sighed, then his heart seized as he spotted corpses drifting in the distance.  "Quickly, help me rescue them! Some might still be alive…" he shouted to his companion.</p><p>The bluefin shark, sated by the giant sea beasts it had devoured, had killed for sport, showing no interest in the bodies.</p><p>Fearful of the shark's return, the two cultivators bravely disembarked, flying towards the corpses with the utmost haste to check for any signs of life.</p><p>Of the three cultivators, they found only two bodies.</p><p>The third had been struck by the bluefin shark's water jet before their very eyes, his body shattered beyond recognition. There was no chance of survival.</p><p>"Senior, Zhang Yue is alive!"</p><p>The other cultivator cried out, cradling a young man in his arms, his face alight with joy.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator hurried over, confirming the faint but steady pulse of the unconscious youth.  Had they not risked leaving the ship, the boy would surely have perished.</p><p>Quickly checking the others, they found one surviving crewman, thrown overboard during the chaos.</p><p>With the two survivors aboard, they returned to the ship.</p><p>The ship's owner was on the verge of tears.  Not only had he lost many crewmen and sea beasts, but two cultivators were dead, and most of the cargo had been lost during the shark’s attack.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator reassured the owner, instructing him to return to the city.  He then hurried into the cabin to examine Zhang Yue's injuries.</p><p>"Senior Wang, I've administered the Restorative Pill as you instructed, but he remains unconscious."</p><p>His companion, tending to Zhang Yue, stepped aside with a worried expression as the middle-aged man entered.</p><p>Placing his hand on Zhang Yue's forehead, the middle-aged man carefully examined him. "His vital energy has stabilized, his wounds are healed, and he's out of danger. He should have awakened by now. Perhaps his spirit has been injured…"</p><p>"His spirit?"</p><p>His companion gasped.</p><p>The middle-aged man nodded, sighing.  "Injuries to the spirit are the most difficult to treat, and I lack the appropriate remedies.  Let him rest here for a few days. Once we return to the island, we'll seek the help of the island's elders."</p><p>They discussed the matter further, then quietly closed the door and went out to deal with the aftermath.</p><p>Shortly after their departure, a figure materialized within the room – Qin Sang.</p><p>He had boarded the ship with them, remaining hidden within the room, his presence undetectable to the two cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand, and Zhang Yue sat up abruptly.  Qin Sang sat opposite him, activating the demonic seed within Zhang Yue to catalyze the nascent spirit embryo.</p><p>The fusion of the seed and the youth would take time, but even a preliminary merging would allow him to "awaken" and act normally.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned the origins of the people on the ship. They hailed from a common island named Heron Island, where the most powerful cultivators were only at the Foundation Establishment stage. They would be unable to see through his avatar's disguise.</p><p>These cultivators, including the young man, were all rogue cultivators who had stumbled onto the path of immortality, without powerful backing or sect affiliations.</p><p>This was precisely why Qin Sang remained.</p><p>The young man's background was "clean."  Qin Sang planned to retain this identity, anticipating its potential usefulness.</p><p>The battered ship, its dragon figurehead shattered by the bluefin shark, began its return journey.</p><p>The high spirits of the outbound voyage had been replaced by a somber atmosphere.</p><p>After seven or eight days, they finally neared Heron Island.</p><p>To the middle-aged cultivator's surprise, Zhang Yue had awakened, moving and speaking normally, his injuries fully healed.</p><p>"Upon landing, ask the island elders to examine your spirit. Don't take this lightly," the middle-aged cultivator advised after examining him once more.</p><p>Zhang Yue shook his head, forcing a smile. "There shouldn't be any major issues.  Besides, my talismans were destroyed in the battle, and I only have enough spirit stones left to buy defensive ones. I'm afraid… I can't afford to consult the elders."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator understood the hardships of low-level cultivators, sympathizing with his plight.  "Then be careful.  Seek help immediately if you notice anything unusual."</p><p>As the ship docked, Zhang Yue bid farewell to his companions and flew home alone.</p><p>Qin Sang learned that Zhang Yue had a family, elderly parents and several siblings.  He was the only one with a spirit root, the sole cultivator in the family.</p><p>Though only at the Qi Refining stage – the lowest rung of the cultivation world – Zhang Yue could still easily protect his family, ensuring their comfortable life.</p><p>Without him, the Zhang family would likely decline. But now, Qin Sang had arrived.</p><p>Back home, Zhang Yue was met with a mixture of respect and awe.</p><p>After dinner, he spoke to his parents, expressing his desire to travel to Holy Island to cultivate.</p><p>Holy Island, also known as Tianxing Island, was named after the Four Sacred Mountains. Both cultivators and mortals knew of its existence, but for most mortals, it remained a mythical place, never to be seen in their lifetime.</p><p>"This near-death experience at sea showed me how insignificant I am.  A mere beast could easily end my life.  Trapped here, I'll never achieve anything great. At most, I'll live a few decades longer than my older brother. I want to go to Holy Island, where there are immortals. Perhaps I can become a disciple…"</p><p>Zhang Yue explained his reasoning, echoing the words he had shared with the middle-aged cultivator. The cultivator, sensing the profound change in Zhang Yue, had advised him to reconsider.</p><p>His parents, though reluctant, could not stop him, tearfully watching him depart.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang left his parents a supply of spirit stones for their health and several basic cultivation manuals, in case any of Zhang Yue's descendants possessed a spirit root.</p><p>That night, Zhang Yue bid farewell to his parents and friends.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his avatar, quietly left the island, embarking on his return journey.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang daily employed the secret techniques of the "Demonic Seed Embryo Nurturing" to refine the body. Once the demonic seed fully fused with the body and formed the spirit embryo, he could proceed to the next step: blood feeding.</p><p>After a long journey, he finally returned to Tianxing Island.</p><p>The upheaval in the Splitwind Islands seemed not to have reached here.</p><p>Tianxing City remained unchanged.</p><p>Upon entering the city, Qin Sang left his avatar in his cave dwelling. After a brief rest, he headed towards the Xiang'an Auction House.</p>
