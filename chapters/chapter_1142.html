<h1>Chapter 1134: The White Cat</h1><p>The street was quiet.</p><p>A ray of sunlight streamed in, falling on the counter, creating dappled light.</p><p>The white cat, eyes closed, lay basking in the warmth, languid and at ease.</p><p>Sensing someone pass the door, the cat lifted an eyelid, saw the figure entering, and its eyes suddenly widened. It stood on its hind legs.</p><p>"Meow!"</p><p>"Master Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang startled, his gaze swiftly scanning the shop, finding only the white cat.</p><p>"You know me?"</p><p>He had found this shop following Yun Youzi's instructions, told it would lead him to an old friend of Yun Youzi's, a beast from the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea. He hadn't expected a cat.</p><p>Studying the cat, Qin Sang's mind suddenly flashed with a memory.</p><p>This was the cat that had sold him the Spirit Eye Cave in Gu Yuan!</p><p>Years ago, Senior Brother Wen of Shao Hua Mountain had sent him to Gu Yuan to deal with disciples of their sect who were cultivating forbidden arts and wreaking havoc. That's where Qin Sang first met the white cat.</p><p>From the cat, he learned that she had been granted divine dew by an elder bamboo demon, which awakened her intelligence, after which she cultivated in the cave.</p><p>But the elder bamboo demon never returned.</p><p>She cultivated alone, without guidance, unsure of how to proceed, so she decided to seek enlightenment at Heavenly Demon Hill, trading the cave for a geomantic chart and protective artifacts.</p><p>"Well, it's you! The bamboo demon who awakened you was Elder Yun Youzi!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>When Yun Youzi was still the Righteous Bamboo, he traveled to Gu Yuan and awakened the white cat, intending to bring her back to the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea at Heavenly Demon Hill.</p><p>However, an accident occurred.</p><p>The Righteous Bamboo failed its tribulation, and its spirit merged with Yun Youzi, resulting in complete loss of cultivation, leaving him unable to care for the cat.</p><p>The cat didn't seem surprised to see Qin Sang, clearly already aware of his connection to Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yet, upon seeing an old acquaintance, the cat showed no joy.</p><p>"Master Qin, did Elder Bamboo Demon…"</p><p>Hesitation and disbelief flickered in the cat's eyes.</p><p>Previously, Yun Youzi had sent a message: if anything happened to him, he would entrust his affairs to Qin Sang.</p><p>She had waited in Immortal Demon City for many years, never receiving word from Yun Youzi. Now that Qin Sang had arrived, but Yun Youzi was absent, the cat felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>The white cat had always had absolute faith in the elder bamboo demon, never imagining he would fail.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes dimmed. He nodded, sighing softly, "The elder failed his tribulation…"</p><p>The cat's eyes instantly reddened, tears welling up. It stared blankly out the window, then curled up, burying its head, saying nothing.</p><p>Yun Youzi had awakened the white cat's intelligence, a kindness akin to rebirth.</p><p>When Qin Sang and the cat parted, she was only a minor demon in the mortal stage. Now, she was clearly in the Core Formation stage.</p><p>Except for descendants of divine beasts and celestial birds, the cultivation speed of demonic beasts was far slower than that of cultivators.</p><p>The cat's current state was due to her own talent, but also certainly to Yun Youzi’s diligent guidance. After all, Yun Youzi had been a transformed bamboo demon, very knowledgeable about demonic beasts.</p><p>To the white cat, Yun Youzi was like a teacher and father, their bond undeniably deep.</p><p>Silence stretched on.</p><p>The white cat lifted its head, its eyes still red, and whispered, "Forgive me, Master Qin, I lost my composure."</p><p>Qin Sang empathized. Seeing the cat's emotions stabilize, he stated his purpose.</p><p>"I understand your feelings. Elder Yun Youzi was a dear friend and benefactor. Before his passing, he entrusted me with several matters, including the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea and its inhabitants. He hoped that after I reached the Nascent Soul stage, I could assist them. Unfortunately, I lack the talent; years of cultivation haven't allowed me to break through. I've come to contact you, to inform you of the elder's passing, and see what I can do…"</p><p>"This isn't the place to talk. Please come with me, Master Qin."</p><p>The white cat raised a paw, closed the door and windows, jumped off the counter, and walked towards the back room.</p><p>Entering the cat's den,</p><p>Qin Sang found that the arrangement was very similar to the cat's previous cave; a sentimental feline.</p><p>"After parting with you, thanks to the geomantic chart, artifacts, and the *Dun Ling Jue* you gave me, I was able to safely cross human territory, reach the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, and see Grandpa Liu…"</p><p>The white cat rallied her spirits, recounting the past to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Grandpa Liu? The willow spirit?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked; he'd heard Yun Youzi mention him before.</p><p>Old Willow is the only late-stage demon cultivator in Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.  He's a willow spirit who achieved enlightenment. There's also a mid-stage demon cultivator, a monkey, who is trustworthy.</p><p>White Cat nodded and continued, "After the Bamboo Demon elder disappeared, Old Willow and Old Monkey struggled to hold on.  Then the Bamboo Demon elder finally returned, and we learned that he had become a human. At that time, the Bamboo Demon elder was only at the Core Formation stage and couldn't reveal himself before the Nascent Soul stage.  So, in the entire Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, only Old Willow and I knew the elder's true identity… I received guidance from the elder, which led to my current state, and I learned about Master Qin from the elder long ago. The elder held Master Qin in high regard, always lamenting his disappearance. Thankfully, Master Qin is safe…"</p><p>After listening to White Cat's detailed explanation,</p><p>Qin Sang gained a general understanding of Yun Youzi's past experiences.</p><p>Yun Youzi planned to reunite with old friends after reaching the Nascent Soul stage. After all, he was unique, an anomaly in the cultivation world. Revealing his identity, even to close relations, could lead to unforeseen consequences.</p><p>However, he didn't expect the sudden invasion of the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>The Celestial Demon Hill had a pact with humanity.</p><p>During intense warfare, the demons couldn't stand idly by. They would dispatch demon beast armies for support, some led by demon kings, others temporarily under the command of human cultivators.</p><p>The internal deployment of demon forces would be decided by the various demon kings.</p><p>The lord of Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea remained hidden, leading other demon kings to harbor suspicions. Without a demon king's protection, they all feared being used as cannon fodder.</p><p>After returning from Ziwei Palace, Yun Youzi made rapid progress, breaking through several cultivation stages. He then possessed the means to protect himself, returning to Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea to reveal his identity to the willow demon.</p><p>After discussion, they disguised their former cave dwelling with a spirit formation.</p><p>Because the alliance of the two realms wasn't losing, and the war hadn't reached its most intense phase, even though the lord of Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea didn't appear, they managed to deceive others.</p><p>"Does each demon king control a demon city?"</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked.</p><p>One of his reasons for visiting White Cat was to gather information about Celestial Demon Hill's geography.</p><p>White Cat shook his head repeatedly, "Impossible. Imperial Dew is extremely precious. Demon kings only use some to cultivate their offspring or promising young demons as confidants to help manage their territories.  Truly intelligent demonic beasts are very rare. Most are untamed and wouldn't stay obediently in a demon city.  Aside from this Immortal Demon City, there's only one demon city in Celestial Demon Hill,  Ten Thousand Demon City in the far north, at the entrance to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  Its city lord is Lord Feather Demon King.  It's said that many of its inhabitants are human…"</p>
