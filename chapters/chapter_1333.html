<h1>Chapter 1325  Does it look good?</h1><p>Time flies.</p><p>Four years later.</p><p>Qin Sang, replacing Qing Jun,  guarded this place for another three years.  Together with her previous three years, she spent a total of six years, barely leaving the Abyssal Ruins.  During this time, she didn't lower her standards.</p><p>She reforged the Jinchen Sword, identifying her shortcomings, and continued commissioning Li Yu Fu to supply her with materials, her refining skills improving steadily.  Simultaneously, she began seriously designing a treasure to subdue the Southern Ming Li Fire.  This time, she had no other treasures to learn from; everything started from scratch.</p><p>Unable to enter the Purple Micro Palace to closely observe the Southern Ming Li Fire, Qin Sang could only rely on previously gathered information to prepare accordingly.  Bai guessed that the Southern Ming Li Fire likely contained a Vermilion Bird's true feather, which explained its enduring flame.  Qin Sang, knowing her knowledge was far inferior to Bai's, could only trust his judgment.</p><p>Among the spiritual objects in Qin Sang's possession suitable for refining a treasure, the most precious was a piece of green copper.  This item, originating from the Purple Micro Palace, was a fragment of a supreme treasure, still retaining power that intimidated the Southern Ming Li Fire. The future treasure would be built around this green copper fragment.</p><p>Next was the carapace of a nine-lives Xuan Turtle. This treasure, painstakingly refined by a transformed-stage demon, was itself comparable to a treasure. It had saved Qin Sang from danger on several occasions by deflecting attacks.  Qin Sang planned to combine these two treasures to capture the Vermilion Bird's true feather.</p><p>The Xuan water power contained within the green copper and the turtle shell both have a counteractive effect on flames.  By using the green copper to suppress the Vermilion Bird's true feather within the turtle shell, the chances of success were high.</p><p>However, Qin Sang also had to consider how to contain, or what method to use to hold the extremely violent Southern Ming Li Fire after capturing the Vermilion Bird's true feather. The Southern Ming Li Fire's power was undeniable, even surpassing the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang turned her attention to the mysterious white copper.  In the Xu Ling Sect, she searched through countless texts but found no record of anything resembling the mysterious white copper.  Driven to desperation, Qin Sang consulted Bing Han, but she couldn't identify the white copper either.</p><p>After arriving at the Abyss of Sins, Qin Sang spoke with Abyssal cultivators, inquiring whether Ye Lao Mo and the others had obtained any texts after they killed the evil spirits during the Abyssal Ruins battle.  The result was still nothing, as Ye Lao Mo had taken everything.</p><p>Qin Sang could confirm two points.  First, the fact that the evil spirits carried the mysterious white copper indicated that it wasn't an ordinary object, even in ancient times. Second, the mysterious white copper glowed like a flame, as bright as the sun, signifying that it was a top-tier fire-attribute treasure, making it an excellent choice to contain the Southern Ming Li Fire.</p><p>These three treasures, along with various spiritual objects received as compensation from the Abyss of Sins, were, in terms of material value, far superior to top-grade treasures.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang didn't rush into action.  A careless mistake could lead to the destruction of the treasures, a regret she couldn't afford.</p><p>Over the four years, Qin Sang did everything she could to analyze the characteristics of the mysterious white copper.  The cultivation world is vast and boundless, with countless treasures; it's impossible for any refiner to know every spiritual object, hence there are methods to analyze unfamiliar spiritual objects, techniques Qin Sang had learned at the Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>Perhaps the mysterious white copper's grade was too high, and the secret techniques were less effective on it. Qin Sang could only resort to brute force, keeping the mysterious white copper constantly on her person, almost as an extension of her body.  It was proving effective, but conclusions were still pending.</p><p>This time, it was the Feather King who relieved her.  Qin Sang handed the jade pendant to the Feather King, preparing to leave the Abyssal Ruins, when she encountered the Judge at the entrance.</p><p>"Daoist Qin," the Judge greeted her warmly, offering a pouch, "These are the spiritual objects Daoist Qin requested. Please examine them."</p><p>Qin Sang opened the pouch, finding only sixty or seventy percent of the items on the list. She looked up at the Judge.</p><p>The Judge rubbed his hands, giving a wry smile, "The Purple Micro Palace is about to open, and I also want to contribute. However, I lost my second primordial spirit in the Yu City battle and have been trying to refine it for years without much success. Recently, I discovered a possible helpful item in a restricted area.  Could Daoist Qin return the Dead Jade to me?  The remaining items are extremely rare. I hope Daoist Qin can consider my sincerity and grant me some more time!"</p><p>Under the Judge's expectant gaze, Qin Sang considered for a moment and agreed.  The other party was also a Nascent Soul cultivator, and he practiced the strange Corpse Path, so there was no need to push him too hard.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the pouch and readily returned the Dead Jade to the Judge.  The Judge was overjoyed.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, have you made any discoveries investigating the Heavenly Corpse Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang had also asked her juniors to keep an eye out, but there was no progress.  Tan Hao and the mysterious person seemed to have vanished without a trace.</p><p>The Judge said, "Since our last meeting, I've been secretly investigating."</p><p>Friend Qin also knows that cultivators of our Corpse Path, while not exactly universally reviled in the cultivation world, face extremely difficult circumstances. We're seen as even more wicked than demonic cultivators, and are forced to rely on each other for support.  I can contact several experts in this path from different regions, but I haven't found the person Friend Qin mentioned, nor have I discovered anyone secretly recruiting Corpse Path cultivators.”</p><p>Has Tan Hao disappeared so completely? Could something have happened to him?</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>Yuan Shen Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the spirit vein to check on the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper.</p><p>As expected, purifying the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper would take at least twenty years, coinciding with the appearance of the Zi Wei Palace.  I wonder if I'll be able to make it in time.</p><p>Even if I finish before the Zi Wei Palace appears, I probably won't have time to refine it.</p><p>Removing the restrictions, the spirit plant was revealed before Qin Sang.</p><p>Compared to sixteen years ago, the plant remained vibrant green, but the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper had changed dramatically!  Originally a crimson blood jasper, the red hue is now extremely faint, and the true form of the spirit flower is now visible. Once the red completely disappears, the purification will be complete.</p><p>After careful examination, Qin Sang restored the restrictions, exited the forbidden area, and unexpectedly encountered Qing Jun.</p><p>"Senior Sister, you've left seclusion?"</p><p>Sixteen years had passed.</p><p>Even as a Nascent Soul cultivator, accustomed to such separations, seeing that familiar face again brought a smile to Qin Sang's lips.</p><p>Qing Jun nodded slightly, saying, "I happen to have something to show you, Junior Brother. Come with me."</p><p>Qin Sang guarded the sect gate for her for three years, yet Qing Jun didn't express any gratitude.  Given their relationship, such formalities were unnecessary.</p><p>The two slowed their pace, leisurely admiring the scenery of the Yun Cang Great Marsh as they flew towards Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke of his hard-earned progress over the past sixteen years, and Qing Jun listened attentively, occasionally offering her insights. Though she's not skilled in refining weapons, her mastery of puppetry is unparalleled.  Since the Great Dao is interconnected, her suggestions were highly enlightening for Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, Qing Jun requested the mysterious white bronze, using her unique secret techniques to help Qin Sang analyze it.</p><p>Soon, they reached Peach Blossom Valley.  Qing Jun dismissed her techniques, sensing Qin Sang's appreciative gaze.</p><p>"Do you find it beautiful?"</p><p>Qing Jun playfully tossed her hair.</p><p>Qin Sang waved open the entrance to Peach Blossom Valley, his gaze falling upon the blossoming peach trees.  He feigned thoughtful contemplation, then shook his head with a sigh: "The peach blossoms are lovely, but they hardly catch my eye at this moment."</p><p>"Pretentious!"</p><p>Qing Jun chided gently, a smile playing on her lips, her eyes sparkling with clarity.</p><p>The two disappeared, entering the valley.</p>
