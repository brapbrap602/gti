<h1>Chapter 1110: Hastening Maturity</h1><p>Afterward, the four of them left Cuiming Mountain and sped along the Wuling River for a while, arriving at Li Yufu's cave abode. The cave was hidden deep within the mountains, embracing the spiritual essence of the surrounding landscape. Reuniting with old friends and learning that Yun Youzi and Mu Yifeng were safe and sound, Qin Sang's spirits were greatly lifted. </p><p>This barren land still concealed such a fine spiritual vein, capable of supporting Golden Core cultivators in their cultivation. Once he retrieved the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid, he could come here to seclude himself and wait for Yun Youzi. Thinking this, Qin Sang gave a few instructions to Li Yufu and the others before leaving alone to continue southward.</p><p>Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>The location where he had hidden the spiritual herb was something Qin Sang would never forget, even in death. His thoughts were anything but calm. The good news was that the forces of the Sin Abyss had been halted at the Tianxing Alliance, and the Yun Cang Great Marsh had not been affected by the war. He had hidden the herb deep within, and barring any unforeseen circumstances, it was surely still there!</p><p>Without a moment's delay, he arrived at the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh and flew alone into the vast expanse of water. The spiritual herb he had longed for day and night was now within reach. Qin Sang submerged into the silt, diving straight down. As he reached the depths of the earth, he finally sensed resistance.</p><p>The Profound Turtle Armor Formation was intact!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart eased, and a glimmer of joy flashed in his eyes. With a wave of his hand, he opened the formation. A surge of rich spiritual energy greeted him, and Qin Sang hurriedly entered the cave, instinctively holding his breath. The spiritual spring was still there, and the cave was filled with an extraordinary abundance of spiritual energy.</p><p>In the center of the spring stood a graceful orchid, its presence captivating Qin Sang's gaze. The petals were eight parts open. All the colors of the orchid had faded, leaving it a pure, pristine white. Elegant. Serene. Yet it stirred the heart and soul.</p><p>The Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid had long since completed its eighth transformation! Qin Sang stared at the orchid in silence for a long time. This orchid had witnessed his escape from Yuanzhao Sect, his entry into Shaohua Mountain, and his journey from Qi Refining to Foundation Building and then to Golden Core. After so many years and countless miles apart, they were finally reunited.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly walked to the edge of the spiritual spring, lost in thought as he recalled the trials of the past years. Coming back to his senses, he took out the Three Radiance Jade Liquid.</p><p>Now, the most important thing for him was to form his Nascent Soul. After handling all the trivial matters, Qin Sang would find a place to seclude himself and cultivate until he reached the peak of the Golden Core stage. His ten years of training in the Demon Sea and several battles in the Seven Slaughter Palace had given him enough experience. He likely wouldn't need to seek out opponents for further combat.</p><p>The True Slaughter Talisman could continue to enhance his talent, and he had also purchased a batch of auxiliary cultivation pills at Yinshan Pass. His cultivation speed would be even faster than before. It wouldn't be long before he could prepare for the Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>To avoid any unforeseen complications, Qin Sang decided to hasten the maturity of the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid and take it away.</p><p>"I hope the effects of the Three Radiance Jade Liquid are genuine. There must be no mishaps..."</p><p>As he was about to hasten the orchid's maturity, Qin Sang felt a sudden wave of worry. He had tried the Three Radiance Jade Liquid before, and while it could accelerate the growth of spiritual fruits, they were often hollow and lacked the corresponding medicinal efficacy.</p><p>The Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid had once grown in the Hanging Garden Palace, nourished by immortal restrictions. But after being removed from the Purple Subtlety Palace for so long, he wasn't sure if it had undergone any unknown changes.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>Qin Sang removed the restrictions on the spiritual spring and opened the jade vial. Sensing the aura of the Three Radiance Jade Liquid, the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid slowly leaned toward the vial, exuding a sense of longing, even impatience.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately guided a drop of the Three Radiance Jade Liquid toward the orchid.</p><p>*Drip!*</p><p>The liquid fell into the flower's stamen and was instantly absorbed. In an instant, boundless vitality erupted, filling the cave. The Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid stretched out joyfully, its stamen, petals, and even the entire plant dancing with delight.</p><p>The spiritual mist emanating from the orchid swirled and condensed, forming various wondrous images that left Qin Sang marveling.</p><p>Qin桑 stared intently at the spiritual herb, holding his breath. Finally, he keenly sensed that the aura of the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid was rapidly changing.</p><p>The spiritual liquid was effective!</p><p>Only upon seeing this did Qin桑 truly relax. He remembered that the first time he returned from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, around that time, the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid had begun its eighth transformation. Each transformation took five hundred years. By his calculations, it would still take over three hundred years for the ninth transformation to complete and the orchid to mature.</p><p>At most, it would require four drops of the Three Radiance Jade Liquid. In the Canglang Sea, Qin桑 had faced danger several times and used quite a bit of the liquid, but there was still more than enough to hasten the orchid's maturity.</p><p>A few days later, the spiritual mist finally stabilized. The medicinal efficacy had been fully absorbed. The Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid's appearance hadn't changed much; only during transformation would its form undergo significant changes.</p><p>Qin桑 continued to guide the Three Radiance Jade Liquid, pouring it onto the spiritual herb. After using the third drop, something unexpected happened. After absorbing the medicinal power, the petals suddenly tightly closed together, forming a bud. It didn't last long before slowly blooming in front of Qin桑.</p><p>At this moment, the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid shed all its splendor, even the spiritual mist dissipating, transforming into the most simple, unadorned orchid!</p><p>Returning to its original simplicity!</p><p>To the naked eye, it was indistinguishable from an ordinary orchid.</p><p>"Only three drops of the Three Radiance Jade Liquid were needed to hasten the maturity of the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid. It seems that each drop of the spiritual liquid doesn't necessarily increase the herb's age by a hundred years. Saving one drop is good; I don't have much left anyway..."</p><p>Qin桑 thought to himself.</p><p>Seeing the long-awaited Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid finally mature, Qin桑 couldn't hide his joy. He carefully removed it from the spiritual spring, holding it with great affection. After a while, he took out a prepared jade box, placed the herb inside, and sealed it with a restriction to preserve its medicinal power.</p><p>Qin桑's face showed a mix of emotions as he took one last look at the cave that had once been his home. Then, carrying the items from the spiritual spring, he flew out of the water.</p><p>The treasure had returned.</p><p>A great weight lifted from his heart.</p><p>Qin桑 flew low over the water, pondering what else needed to be done. Previously, he had planned to sneak near Shaohua Mountain to inquire about Mu Yifeng's whereabouts. But since Mu Yifeng hadn't incurred Dongyang Bo's wrath, there was no need to take such a risk.</p><p>Though he longed to visit his old sect and friends, the threat of Dongyang Bo hung over him like a sword, forcing him to act with caution.</p><p>"Bury Senior Qingzhu, then gather some information on the current situation before returning to seclusion."</p><p>Qin桑 made his decision and turned his flying light westward.</p><p>"Peach Blossom Valley—that should be Senior Qingzhu's hometown! If there are red jade peaches there, they must be the better taste Senior Qingzhu spoke of. I wonder how sweet they are?"</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley was located on the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, between Shaohua Mountain and Yuan Shen Sect. According to Senior Qingzhu, it wasn't the territory of any immortal sect or cultivation family.</p><p>The place wasn't hard to find.</p><p>Qin桑 didn't spend much effort and soon located Peach Blossom Valley. Not long after leaving the Yun Cang Great Marsh, he entered the mountain range and flew along one of the ridges before suddenly descending.</p><p>It was just after sunrise.</p><p>Morning mist drifted through the mountains, enveloping the surrounding peaks.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley lay below.</p><p>Qin桑 landed on a mountain peak and activated his true essence, sending out the talisman seal Senior Qingzhu had taught him. To his surprise, the mist rippled, but the formation didn't open.</p><p>Just then, a red figure suddenly emerged from the formation.</p><p>"Oh? You're not dead?"</p>
