<h1>Chapter 1887:  The Soul-Splitting God-Slaying Technique</h1><p>Chapter 1887:  The Soul-Splitting God-Slaying Technique</p><p>The next moment, the ancient demon's fragmented soul opened its maw, letting out a demonic howl.</p><p>The howl was piercing, capable of shattering gold and stone!</p><p>The sound seemed to emanate from the depths of everyone's hearts, shaking their primordial spirits; ordinary methods were useless against it.</p><p>The ancient demon's fragmented soul, having devoured Mo Qingzhu, howled at the heavens.</p><p>He stood suspended in mid-air, arms outstretched, wild hair flying, his form like a demonic fiend.</p><p>Upon hearing the demonic howl, the young man and woman’s faces turned pale; they cried out and collapsed to the ground.</p><p>The protective barrier the old man had set up proved ineffective.  Fortunately, the howl wasn't directly targeted at them; they only heard the echoes. Otherwise, the two would have likely died on the spot.</p><p>Even so, their condition was dire; they bled from their seven orifices and suffered grievous injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang's primordial spirit shone with a golden light, revealing a golden Buddha.</p><p>The shock of the demonic howl triggered a reaction from the jade Buddha, protecting Qin Sang from harm.</p><p>But seeing the young man and woman's plight, Qin Sang cleverly threw himself to the ground, severing several meridians, and feigning bleeding from his seven orifices.</p><p>His face was filled with terror, his heart burning with anxiety; he closed his eyes tightly.</p><p>No one noticed that Qin Sang was clutching a demonic banner at that moment, wisps of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire enveloped by his spiritual sense, drawn into his body and gathered within his Purple Mansion.</p><p>At this critical juncture, he was calmly cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*!</p><p>Due to traces of Old Man Mou's lingering essence within the lotus seed, he couldn't erase them.  Qin Sang could only discard the seed and forcefully cultivate using his own strength.</p><p>However, the seed's greatest function was to serve as a vessel for the spiritual fire, mitigating its harm to the cultivator and preventing the burning of their primordial spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang had the jade Buddha to protect him, making the seed unnecessary.</p><p>If Old Man Mou saw this, he would surely be dumbfounded and curse Qin Sang as a madman.</p><p>When he refined the Winter Netherworld Cold Flame, he had been extremely cautious each time, failing countless times and nearly freezing his primordial spirit several times before successfully forging the fire seed.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was something even Old Man Mou wouldn't dare provoke lightly.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang dared to refine demonic fire into a fire seed on his first attempt!</p><p>If not for the jade Buddha's protection, Qin Sang would have immolated himself; even so, he endured immense pain.  His Purple Mansion felt as if it were boiling, completely disrupted by the demonic fire.</p><p>The demonic fire was untamable.</p><p>To cultivate the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* to completion in a short time wasn't realistic.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was simply to tame a strand of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and condense it into an initial demonic seed.</p><p>Following the secret techniques in the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, he embraced the demonic fire with his primordial spirit, relying on the jade Buddha, completely unafraid of the burning sensation, and focused on guiding the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, gradually revealing the shape of a fire seed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the ancient demon's fragmented soul suddenly attacked, and the previously favorable situation took a sharp turn for the worse.</p><p>The ancient demon's fragmented soul’s aura fluctuated violently.  With a howl, an invisible wave suddenly appeared in the void.</p><p>In an instant, Ling Zhuzi and the others felt an ominous premonition, their faces turning pale with shock.</p><p>In the void before their foreheads, a transparent spiritual blade suddenly appeared, followed by a splitting headache.  Caught off guard, they cried out, their bodies trembling uncontrollably as they all fell to the ground.</p><p>Screams rose and fell.</p><p>Everyone clutched their heads, their faces contorted in agony, experiencing unimaginable pain.</p><p>Their dao techniques and treasures were powerless at this moment.</p><p>The technique the ancient demon's fragmented soul had just used was the Soul-Splitting God-Slaying Technique, and its effect was astonishing.</p><p>A group of experts were unable to withstand this single blow, instantly grievously injured and rendered combat-incapable.</p><p>Seeing the lambs awaiting slaughter, the ancient demon's fragmented soul laughed wildly.</p><p>After using the Soul-Splitting God-Slaying Technique, he had paid a heavy price, his aura greatly weakened, his strength not what it once was, but still far better than Ling Zhuzi and the others.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ancient demon's fragmented soul flickered, targeting the Nine-Lives Xuanwu first.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuanwu’s body convulsed in pain, unable to fight back.  It watched helplessly as the ancient demon's fragmented soul approached, then felt its body tighten, unable to move.</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuanwu revealed its true form, struggling desperately, only to be punched through the abdomen by the ancient demon's fragmented soul, blood spurting as it let out a final scream.</p><p>The giant Xuan Turtle's body was like a toy in the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul's hands, easily manipulated.  Flesh and bone were pulverized.  The Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle followed in the Dragon King's footsteps; its essence and flesh were refined by the Ancient Demon's soul using a secret technique, then cast into the blood coffin.</p><p>Fueled by the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle's energy, the Blood River formation grew stronger, the blood coffin regaining some of its crimson glow.  Conversely, the bloody aura within the sword energy intensified.  In an instant, the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle met its end.</p><p>The onlookers felt a profound sorrow, a shared sense of loss.  Two of their races' most powerful warriors, who once commanded the elements, were about to die here, sacrifices for the Ancient Demon's emergence.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>The Ancient Demon's soul, having crushed the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, was about to attack the next person when Nan Gui Xianzi, closest to the turtle, sensed a strange fluctuation.  He abruptly turned towards a corner of the bloody crystalline wall.</p><p>There, a leafhopper the size of a fist clung to the wall, motionless.  It was Fang Laomo.</p><p>Compared to the humans, the leafhopper was insignificant, easily overlooked.  Yet, Fang Laomo's previously displayed strength was comparable to the others, causing significant trouble for the Ancient Demon.</p><p>Fang Laomo, too, was targeted by the Ancient Demon's soul and couldn't escape. Being an insect-蛊 body, his spirit seemed more fragile than the others, his life force flickering, near death.</p><p>Then, an unexpected event unfolded.</p><p>The leafhopper, clinging tightly to the bloody wall, suddenly split open, revealing a tiny spirit cicada, about the size of an adult's thumb, emerging from within.  The cicada was as translucent as jade, its delicate wings adorned with tiny sparkles.</p><p>Even the Ancient Demon's soul was startled by this extraordinary sight.</p><p>"Starwing Cicada!  Twin Gu?"  the Grand Witch Doctor exclaimed.</p><p>She and Fang Laomo were both from the Witch Clan, yet she had been unaware that he not only possessed the leafhopper body but also concealed another life-bound insect-蛊.  Furthermore, these twin Gu possessed different bloodlines.</p><p>One was a leafhopper, possessing sonic abilities, striking with unexpected attacks.  The other was the Starwing Cicada, possessing extraordinary escape skills.</p><p>Both were rare and extraordinary insects, almost impossible to find in the current age, and whose cultivation methods were unknown.  On the Witch God Continent, Qin Sang had encountered a Witch cultivator with twin Gu, Cui Xuanzi, the leader of the Five Insect Sect, but one of his Gu had stagnated in growth.</p><p>Fang Laomo's twin Gu seemed different.</p><p>With the Starwing Cicada's emergence, the leafhopper visibly withered, like a piece of paper peeling off the cicada, as though all its essence had been absorbed.  The Starwing Cicada, still seemingly weak, had already partially embedded itself into the bloody crystalline wall.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>This is yesterday's update.</p><p>Writing on my phone on the train; today's two chapters will be delayed.</p><p>Written hastily, no time for proofreading; I'll revise tomorrow.</p>
