Chapter 469: Hidden Intentions


“Yes!”


The handsome young man secretly produced a charm, about to activate it.


Old Woman Jing seemed to have overheard their conversation.  A beam of moonlight, like flowing water, yet incredibly swift, suddenly streamed down from the bright moon.


Like a silver river descending from the heavens, it reached the young man in the blink of an eye.


“Child's play!”


Elder Palm Star coldly snorted, reaching out to pluck a star.  Like a general deploying troops, he instantly arranged the stars in the sky into a killing formation.


Stars scattered, no longer merging into one, but solidifying into a star net.


The star net, like a blade, intercepted the moonlight.


The moonlit galaxy shattered.


Elder Palm Star was a fraction of a second too late, failing to completely sever the moonlight. Only half was blocked, but the remaining sliver was insignificant; the young man's cultivation was sufficient to handle it.


The handsome young man raised his sword, its light blazing, receiving the impact of the moonlight.


A muffled groan was heard, and the young man's face flushed.


Unexpectedly, the moonlight transformed into a long whip, lashing fiercely at the young man's sword.


A tremendous force struck, catching the young man off guard. Though uninjured, he was sent flying back dozens of meters before managing to dissipate the force.


At this moment, Qin Sang, who had been observing from the periphery, suddenly moved.


Sensing Old Woman Jing's gaze, understanding her intention, he decisively said, “I can handle this one. Senior, focus on the other two!”


He hadn't left because he couldn't. From the moment the three from the Yuan Shen Sect saw him, he and Old Woman Jing were bound together.


No matter what, the three from the Yuan Shen Sect had to die!


He believed Old Woman Jing wasn't reckless.  Her daring assassination attempt on Leng Yuntian indicated a degree of confidence.


However, Qin Sang hadn't rashly interfered in their fight, waiting for Old Woman Jing's explicit instruction before acting.


Seeing Old Woman Jing assign him the handsome young man instead of one of the two Golden Core cultivators, Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief. If he exerted all his strength and used his two magic treasures, he could probably hold them off for a while, but it would be extremely dangerous.


Qin Sang wasn't arrogant enough to think he could defeat a Core Formation cultivator, even one with suppressed cultivation.


If it came to it, his life was more important; exposing his magic treasures would be a worthwhile sacrifice.


Fortunately, Old Woman Jing was confident, daring to fight two Golden Core cultivators at once.


Comparatively, the handsome young man was much easier to deal with.


A Foundation Establishment cultivator – Qin Sang wasn't afraid of anyone at that level.


His Hanjin Sword led the way!


The sword's frigid light radiated intense coldness, aiming straight for the young man's back.


Qin Sang followed closely, swift as thunder, his hand clutching the Yin-Yang Compass, its light flickering.


His timing was impeccable. The young man, having been knocked back by the whip, was in disarray.  Before he could regain his footing, his back was completely undefended.


Yu Shan Ting was entangled by the Azure Bird.


Elder Palm Star was manipulating the star array, fully engaged with Old Woman Jing.


No one could rescue the young man.


In an instant, the Hanjin Sword was a hair's breadth from the young man.  As a top-tier magic weapon, its power was unquestionable.  Enveloped by its energy, the young man’s body was covered in a layer of frost, his movements seemingly stiffening.


Just as the young man was about to meet his end,


He suddenly turned to look at Qin Sang, a mocking sneer on his face. Abruptly, he opened his right palm and flung it backward.


‘Whoosh!’


Countless shimmering fragments scattered, and among the charm pieces, a subtle black light flashed – a small, dark hammer.


A charm treasure!


The hammer's speed was astonishing, surpassing the Hanjin Sword to strike at Qin Sang.


In Qin Sang's vision, the hammer rapidly grew larger, clearly visible.  Pointed at both ends like two chisels, Qin Sang had no doubt that if struck, he would have a gaping hole in his head.


The young man had been guarding against him all along.


It was understandable. In such a large square, with him and Old Woman Jing appearing simultaneously, they wouldn't believe they weren't working together. They must have been secretly preparing for this.


While he'd been observing coldly, they hadn't attacked him directly, instead setting a trap, secretly preparing the charm treasure, attempting to eliminate the weakest one – him – quickly, then focusing on Old Woman Jing.


Perhaps the young man being knocked back by the moonlight was a ruse.


If Old Woman Jing's strength hadn't surpassed their expectations, allowing her to hold her own against two opponents, preventing them from being distracted, the situation would be vastly different.  At this moment, he faced more than just the young man.


Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  If he hadn't spent years on the battlefield, he might have fallen for the trap.


‘Whew!’

Facing the black hammer, Qin Sang remained calm under pressure. Raising his Yin-Yang compass, he fired a beam of white light.

The Yin-Yang compass was certainly inferior to a talisman treasure, but even the strongest talisman treasure couldn't ignore a top-grade magical artifact. Besides, Qin Sang wouldn't rely solely on artifacts.

The ebony sword, struck by the white light, didn't lose speed under the force of suction, but its trajectory veered slightly.

That was enough!

Qin Sang, prepared beforehand, instantly flickered, dodging the surprise attack. He glared coldly at the handsome young man.

The cold-gold sword, naturally, had no effect and was retrieved by Qin Sang.

“Huh?”

The handsome young man, surprised that Qin Sang so easily evaded the talisman treasure’s attack, looked over in astonishment, playing with the black hammer. He sneered, “So you’re not just a figurehead. You actually have some skill! Shadowless Sword… I want to see just how capable you are, daring to be disrespectful to my senior brother!”

Qin Sang now knew who the handsome young man's senior brother was.

Miao Xinglan.

Called the top expert of the Yuan Shen Sect, his cultivation was formidable.  He was the one sent by the Yuan Shen Sect to the Zhitai Peak this time.

Because of Elder Qingzhu, Shao Hua Mountain and the Yuan Shen Sect had an irreconcilable feud, affecting their disciples.

Qin Sang didn't want to get involved in these grudges, nor did he want to make enemies. But having been repeatedly targeted by Yuan Shen Sect disciples, he wouldn't endlessly endure.  Even a clay Buddha has a temper.

So, he seized an opportunity and, cooperating with Senior Brother Rong, gave Miao Xinglan a lesson.  Neither side suffered any real damage, but the feud was established.

The handsome young man seemed to have a good relationship with Miao Xinglan, which explained his dislike for Qin Sang.

‘Whoosh!’

The black hammer shot towards him again.

Qin Sang retreated rapidly, putting away both the Yin-Yang compass and the cold-gold sword. Simultaneously, a blue light emerged from his palm, eventually transforming into a circular mirror—another talisman treasure!

He had seized this talisman treasure from a Nascent Soul stage cultivator of the Tianxing League.  The handsome young man was deceitful, and Qin Sang wasn't a saint either; he had secretly prepared his own talisman treasure.

Unfortunately, although the handsome young man was boastful, he wasn't reckless in battle. Qin Sang hadn’t found a chance to launch a surprise attack with his talisman treasure.  Forced by the black hammer, he could no longer hide it.

The mirror soared high, meeting the black hammer.

‘Bang!’

The two talisman treasures clashed, neither yielding.  After a brief collision, they separated, transforming into blue and black streaks of light, chasing each other between Qin Sang and the handsome young man.
