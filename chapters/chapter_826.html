<h1>Chapter 818: The Trap</h1><p>Through the strange light, Qin Sang saw a bizarre scene.</p><p>In front of the protective formation, only one person was attacking, yet they seemed to have the upper hand, the strange light flickering precariously.</p><p>Despite the slow progress in breaking the formation, the attacker didn't appear to be in a hurry.</p><p>Near this person, a thick fog shrouded a large area at the foot of the mountain, resembling sea mist rising at night.</p><p>Within the fog, two shadowy figures could be vaguely discerned.</p><p>This was no ordinary sea fog; even the Skyeye Butterfly couldn't penetrate it. It was definitely an illusionary formation.</p><p>Qin Sang stared for a while, finally confirming the presence of two figures. Hidden within the fog, they seemed busy, but not with breaking the formation.</p><p>The fog obscured their identities and actions.</p><p>Witnessing this, Qin Sang felt puzzled and uneasy. He urged the Skyeye Butterfly to use its full power to peer through the fog.</p><p>Inside the fog, the two figures were jointly manipulating a formation disk.</p><p>One wore black robes, the other gray, their faces concealed, their auras hidden.</p><p>The disk floated between them, each touching it with one hand, channeling a continuous stream of potent true essence into it, showing no signs of exhaustion.</p><p>As the true essence poured in, yellow light gathered at the center of the disk, soon transforming into a small triangular flag.</p><p>The gray-robed figure pointed towards the ground beside them, the flag trembling slightly before shooting off and silently sinking into the earth, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Over a dozen such flags had already been planted.</p><p>A grand formation was gradually taking shape.</p><p>Suddenly, the gray-robed figure seemed to sense something, abruptly turning towards the sea beyond Liangqiu Island, their gaze sharp as a hawk.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>The other person asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p>"An interesting youngster."</p><p>The gray-robed figure said casually, waving a hand to thicken the fog, their forms flickering and vanishing completely. "Probably just passing by, drawn by the commotion here, observing from afar. Quite capable, seems to have the ability to see through the Mist Trace Formation. Fortunately, my senses are sharp. He shouldn't have noticed anything."</p><p>"Weren't you saying there were no powerful cultivators around? What a coincidence."</p><p>The black-robed figure grumbled. "Luo Daotong has sent out the distress signal. Given the time, Yin Laomo should have learned of this and be on his way. Luo is Yin Laomo's beloved disciple; he won't ignore this. Hurry up and set the Killing Formation. Don't let anything else go wrong and alert Yin Laomo."</p><p>The gray-robed figure nodded. "The Mist Trace Formation is indeed a bit weak... Don't worry, I've taken remedial measures. That kid won't see anything. If he dares to come to the island, we'll deal with him first. This is a Killing Formation bestowed by the Sect Master himself, more than enough to capture Yin Laomo. Once it's set, even if Yin Laomo senses something amiss upon arrival, it'll be too late. He won't escape."</p><p>As they spoke, another triangular flag formed.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the distance, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, his heart in turmoil.</p><p>Sensing something amiss, he hadn't dared to approach, only directing the Skyeye Butterfly to use its full power.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as he was about to see the figures within the fog clearly, they suddenly vanished, as if they had never existed, the previous images mere illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang acutely felt two gazes from within the fog, as if meeting his own, like two heavy hammers striking his mind.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils contracted sharply, immediately stopping the Skyeye Butterfly's power.</p><p>He didn't believe what he saw was an illusion; there was definitely a secret hidden within the fog, powerful cultivators concealed within.</p><p>Had they been detected?  To so easily discover his observation and sever the Skyeye Butterfly's vision, what level of cultivation did they possess?</p><p>Qin Sang had felt strange that the attacker wasn't in a hurry to kill Luo Daotong.</p><p>Coupled with his current discovery, alarm bells rang in Qin Sang's mind. These people hiding on Liangqiu Island, not breaking the formation to kill, meant their target wasn't Luo Daotong.</p><p>In this moment, Liangqiu Island felt like a dragon's lair or a tiger's den, making Qin Sang's hair stand on end.</p><p>Better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>He didn't dare linger, turning to flee.</p><p>Within the fog, the gray-robed figure let out a soft "Eh?", turning again towards the sea.</p><p>"That kid ran away, so decisively. Did he really see something? Shouldn't be possible, probably just detected the Mist Trace Formation."</p><p>The black-robed figure snorted. "If someone sees through our identities and causes trouble for the sect, how will we explain to the Sect Master?"</p><p>The gray-robed figure chuckled. "This Killing Formation is newly refined by the Sect Master, and we've carefully concealed our identities. How could a youngster easily see through us? Forget it, the formation isn't complete, we can't leave the island yet. Send another soul servant out..."</p><p>The gray-robed figure pondered, reaching into their robes and retrieving a gourd.</p><p>The gourd was ordinary, yellow with blemishes, no different from a mundane gourd.</p><p>The gray-robed figure opened the lid, tilting the gourd, a pale light flashing as a small, frail-looking woman appeared before them.</p><p>The woman's body was ethereal and translucent, a soul.</p><p>The gray-robed figure whispered a few words, then commanded, "Go, quickly resolve this. Kill that youngster. Anyone at or above the Core Formation stage who dares approach within three miles of Liangqiu Island, kill them all. But do not kill innocents, or you will be denied blood sustenance for ten years."</p><p>The woman's face lit up with a fanatical expression, bowing to the gray-robed figure before vanishing.</p><p>Seeing this, the black-robed figure glanced at the man attacking the formation, chuckling. "Your soul refinement techniques are becoming increasingly refined. These two soul servants should have peak Core Formation strength, right? Who would have thought that an elder of the Heavenly Path Sect, the number one righteous sect, would have such profound skill in ghost arts?"</p><p>The gray-robed figure said indifferently, "Soul refinement is but a minor art, useless for one's own cultivation. My bottleneck remains stubbornly in place, the ghost path also blocked. These soul servants aren't inherently powerful, but their abilities are unique, appearing and disappearing without a trace, making them seem eerie to ordinary cultivators. Moreover, refining them is extremely difficult. I've spent so long and only managed to refine these two, realizing they've reached their limit, impossible to achieve Nascent Soul strength, so I abandoned it. With our cultivation, what use would more of these soul servants be?"</p><p>"Indeed, cultivation is the foundation."</p><p>The black-robed figure nodded, falling silent.</p><p>Silence returned to Liangqiu Island.</p><p>With their combined efforts, the formation disk spun faster and faster, the Killing Formation nearly enveloping the entire island, like a ferocious beast, poised to devour any enemy who dared to land.</p><p>Luo Daotong, trapped within the protective formation, remained oblivious to all of this.</p><p>Anxious, he awaited rescue.</p><p>The enemy was powerful and their methods bizarre, constantly finding weaknesses in his formation. The situation was dire.</p>
