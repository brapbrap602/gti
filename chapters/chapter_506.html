<h1>Chapter 499: Striving for Core Formation</h1><p>Qin Sang sealed his cave once more.  He swept his hand over his storage pouch and retrieved a jade box.</p><p>Opening the box, a golden Kanli Core Formation Pill, radiating dazzling golden light, illuminated both Qin Sang and the cave. Atop the pill swirled a miniature vortex of clearly defined black and white energies, resembling a dragon and a tiger.</p><p>The pill, with its nascent dragon and tiger, seemed vibrant with life.</p><p>However, compared to the Nine Phantasmal Orchid beside it, the Kanli Core Formation Pill paled in comparison.</p><p>As if provoked by the pill, the orchid swayed gently, its blossom instantly conjuring a kaleidoscope of illusions, each appearing vividly real.</p><p>The Nine Phantasmal Orchid displayed its formidable power.</p><p>In that instant, the Kanli Core Formation Pill's light dimmed, its dragon and tiger aura dissipating slightly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even spiritual herbs competed with each other.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled, then sealed the pill's aura with a wave of his hand, causing the orchid to subside.</p><p>Holding the Kanli Core Formation Pill, Qin Sang meditated for several days, refining his condition to its peak and calming his mind.  Finally, he opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.</p><p>The pill entered his stomach.</p><p>Before long, it dissolved within him, its power transforming into two distinct energies.  These energies intertwined, then upon entering his meridians, abruptly separated, each flowing into a different pathway.</p><p>These two energies were diametrically opposed.</p><p>One was scorching yang energy; as it flowed, Qin Sang's meridians felt as though seared by flames, causing intense pain.</p><p>The other was an icy yin energy; upon contact, Qin Sang felt as if plunged into an icy abyss.</p><p>Half of his body burned like fire, his skin flushed red, while the other half froze, radiating a chill that formed a thin layer of ice on his skin.</p><p>As these energies raged within him, he faintly heard the roars of a dragon and a tiger echoing continuously in his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated the effects of the Kanli Core Formation Pill and remained calm.</p><p>He focused his mind, unaffected by the roars, diligently monitoring the energy flows, guiding them toward his qi sea.</p><p>The two energies advanced together, nearing his qi sea.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly flipped his palm, revealing several pills he had prepared.  He quickly swallowed two healing pills to mend the damage the energies had inflicted on his meridians, then focused all his attention on his qi sea.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>His qi sea trembled violently.</p><p>The two energies collided within it.</p><p>In that moment, the spiritual energy within his qi sea churned like boiling water.</p><p>Moreover, the changes he had experienced in his meridians began to replay within his qi sea.</p><p>Ice and fire clashed!</p><p>Scalding heat, then piercing cold…</p><p>The abrupt temperature shifts destabilized his qi sea, the fluctuations intensifying relentlessly.</p><p>The impact of the Kanli Core Formation Pill's energy on his qi sea was terrifying. Had he consumed the pill unprepared, he would have been forced to expel the energy.</p><p>Otherwise, not only would he fail to achieve Core Formation, but he might also worsen his condition.</p><p>Fortunately, not all aids for Core Formation were so destructive.</p><p>Different pills possessed vastly different potencies.</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower were far gentler, requiring only ordinary healing pills in preparation.</p><p>Qin Sang persevered for a while, but as his qi sea teetered on the brink of collapse, he unhesitatingly swallowed another pill.</p><p>The pill dissolved into a gentle energy that quickly flowed through his meridians and into his qi sea.</p><p>The storm within raged, but with the influx of this new energy, the violent conflict eased slightly. The respite was short-lived, however, as the turmoil soon returned.</p><p>He swallowed another pill.</p><p>…</p><p>After three pills, Qin Sang finally weathered the most perilous phase.  Though his qi sea remained turbulent, he regained a semblance of control.</p><p>Countless predecessors on Shaohua Mountain had consumed the Kanli Core Formation Pill, meticulously documenting the crucial stages. Qin Sang, with a brief assessment, knew he had stabilized the situation.</p><p>He immediately calmed his mind and focused on circulating his cultivation technique.</p><p>The *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* cycled rapidly.</p><p>One cycle after another.</p><p>His qi sea still churned, but the storm gradually weakened, and his spiritual energy seemed to undergo a subtle transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang diligently circulated the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*, searching for the breakthrough.</p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p>The spiritual energy within the cave, disrupted by Qin Sang's pill consumption, returned to tranquility.</p><p>A day and a night passed swiftly.</p><p>The following evening, Qin Sang abruptly awoke.</p><p>His gaze drifted across the jade pool and the orchid before snapping down to his dantian. Incredulity tinged his voice as he murmured,</p><p>“This… is it?”</p><p>His qi sea was completely calm, devoid of any chaos, seemingly unchanged from before he had consumed the Kanli Core Formation Pill.</p><p>This was not a good sign!</p><p>He had failed.</p><p>Successful Core Formation, though time-consuming, would eventually manifest.</p><p>Failure, however, was swiftly apparent.</p><p>It took Qin Sang a while to accept reality, a bitter taste in his mouth.</p><p>The Kanli Core Formation Pill’s potency had been exhausted so quickly.</p><p>He had exerted his utmost effort, unwavering in his focus, yet he hadn’t experienced even a hint of the anticipated breakthrough.</p><p>As before, he had not only failed to achieve Core Formation but had gained no insights either.</p><p>In the accounts left by his predecessors, even those who failed with the Kanli Core Formation Pill reported some discernible change.</p><p>Some even experienced the initial signs of Core Formation, only to falter at the last moment due to mental instability, their regret palpable.</p><p>This benevolent predecessor later succeeded in Core Formation, leaving a warning for posterity to temper their Dao Heart before attempting the breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubts about his Dao Heart, yet he hadn't even encountered the situations described by his predecessors.</p><p>What breakthrough?</p><p>What signs?</p><p>There were none!</p><p>The spiritual energy in his qi sea remained unchanged, showing no signs of coalescing.</p><p>Perhaps there had been subtle fluctuations, but they were too faint and fleeting to grasp.</p><p>Of course, the predecessors who reached the Pseudo Core Formation stage all possessed greater talent than Qin Sang. None of those who left records shared his five-element spiritual root constitution.</p><p>Was it his talent?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of frustration. After a moment of contemplation, he entered meditation once more, resuming his cultivation technique, and trying again.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his cave again, returning to the small island.  Finding no message from Yun You Zi, he returned to his seclusion.</p><p>For a month, he tirelessly cultivated, hoping for a turning point.  The result was disappointing; his cultivation remained stagnant.</p>
