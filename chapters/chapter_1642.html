<h1>Chapter 1633: Guidance</h1><p>Chapter 1633: Guidance</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang cultivated a Yuan Mo fetus, creating a physical manifestation to infiltrate the Lan Dou sect and gather intelligence.  By chance, this manifestation gained the Lan Dou sect's Yin-Yang branch's acceptance and learned the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique."</p><p>The Lan Dou sect's original inheritance only encompassed the first layer.  Later, a remarkably talented senior Yin-Yang Daoist completed the cultivation method and passed it down.</p><p>This technique, from the beginning of cultivation, refines Yin-Yang armor and cultivates Yin-Yang energy, making it quite extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite tempted, even considering it as a backup technique for the "Chapter on Cultivating the Yuan Shen Sword." He later discovered the method was incomplete and its true lineage difficult to acquire, so he abandoned the idea.</p><p>However, he had already mastered the first layer of the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique," refining a set of Yin-Yang armor to shield the Buddha light from the jade Buddha within his Yuan Shen.</p><p>For many years, the Yin-Yang armor proved ineffective.  Qin Sang lacked the time to delve into this technique and thus neglected it, almost forgetting it entirely.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a stirring arose; the treasure within the jade cage seemed connected to this technique!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised, his gaze fixed on the orb.</p><p>The jade cage, carved from spirit jade, prevented his celestial eye from seeing the treasure inside.</p><p>Investigating the Cloud Pool with his spiritual sense met with a forceful counterattack.  To discover the sealed treasure, he needed a way to lure the jade cage out.</p><p>He didn't spend too long in the lower level of the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>There was no pressing need for haste.</p><p>He was also curious about the treasure related to the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique." Although he’d only cultivated the first layer, Qin Sang believed the technique was undeniably significant, a major inheritance!</p><p>He turned, staring at the drifting jade cage, moving around the surrounding corridors to maintain the closest proximity.</p><p>Simultaneously, guided by Qin Sang, the Celestial Eye Butterfly exerted its celestial eye power to the limit, meticulously searching and considering the safest method to retrieve the treasure.</p><p>During the annihilation of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, even the Immortal Pavilion remained intact. Even using the Sun God Tree, he couldn't destroy the Cloud Pool; forceful acquisition was clearly impossible.</p><p>A single misstep could cause unpredictable changes within the Cloud Pool, leading to even greater complications.</p><p>"The energy of every treasure within the pool is intertwined with the Cloud Pool, forming a whole; affecting one affects all. To retrieve treasures from the pool requires finesse. Human effort has limits; it’s difficult for a single person. If I summoned my physical manifestation or had more assistance, it would be much easier…"</p><p>The enemies of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect back then might not have surpassed him in the art of formations and prohibitions, yet they likely employed multiple individuals to retrieve treasures, but still failed to empty the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped fixating on the jade cage, looking down at the entire Cloud Pool, silently strategizing.</p><p>Soon, a stream of light flew from his dantian.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly flew outside, gently fluttering its wings around the Cloud Pool, while Qin Sang remained stationary, his eyes flashing with strange lights; the Immortal Pavilion fell silent once more.</p><p>After an unknown period.</p><p>Qin Sang lightly exhaled, pondered for a moment, and then a fire lotus appeared on his forehead.</p><p>Then, the demonic fire from the demonic banner was also summoned by Qin Sang, guided by the fire lotus, forming a sea of fire above his head.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly moved his mind, the sea of fire dividing into four, the flames converging towards the center of the four masses, gradually transforming into four fire figures.  The fire figures lacked features and sentience, merely simple imitations, but each contained a trace of Qin Sang's essence; he himself remained sealed.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Four fire figures flew towards the four corners of the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the middle of a corridor, overseeing the situation.</p><p>Once again, the Immortal Pavilion fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly watched the jade cage dart around the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Finally, the jade cage neared the center of the Cloud Pool.  Qin Sang's expression shifted, and he pressed his hand towards the Cloud Pool, releasing the long-prepared hand seal.</p><p>Simultaneously, the four fire figures, as if receiving a command, raised their arms in unison, pointing towards the jade cage; eight fire serpents emerged successively from within them.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>The fire serpents shot into the Cloud Pool, immediately provoking a violent counterattack.</p><p>Thunderous sounds erupted; cloud thunder burst forth from the four corners of the Cloud Pool. The fire serpents pressed on, directly colliding with the cloud thunder.</p><p>Amidst the 'rumbling' sound, the fire serpents proved no match for the cloud thunder, and many were defeated.</p><p>However, the fire serpents acted in pairs.  While the leading serpent resisted the cloud thunder, the following serpent seized the opportunity to penetrate the thunder barrier and contact the cloud mist within the Cloud Pool.</p><p>The cloud mist wasn't physically real but a manifestation of the Cloud Pool's prohibition.</p><p>The demonic fire's power and the Cloud Pool's prohibition clashed directly.</p><p>This was the crucial moment.  As the prohibition countered, the treasures in the pool started to become translucent, threatening to vanish as before.</p><p>He had to retrieve the jade cage before the treasure vanished.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly hovered in mid-air, taking in the scene within the Cloud Pool and transmitting the images to Qin Sang's mind. He had to divide his attention four ways, controlling four fire figures to counter the changes from four directions.</p><p>Qin Sang exerted all his effort to deduce the changes in the restrictions. Even with his cultivation, he felt immense pressure, his brow furrowed, breath held, not daring to be distracted.</p><p>The fire figures misled the Cloud Pool's restrictions.</p><p>The Cloud Pool's restrictions treated the fire figures as enemies, unleashing furious thunderclouds towards the four corners. Undeterred by death, the fire figures not only held their ground but fiercely counterattacked.</p><p>Inside the Cloud Pool, their confrontation with the restrictions also showed progress.</p><p>Within the cloud, four fire serpents multiplied and unexpectedly connected, forming a hollow net of fire, rapidly contracting inwards.</p><p>This couldn't stop the treasure within the Cloud Pool from disappearing, but it could restrain the Cloud Pool's restrictions, slowing down the jade cage's vanishing.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang was not merely multitasking; he focused a part of his mind on the jade cage, analyzing the changes in its surrounding restrictions against the clock!</p><p>At that moment, he finally made his move!</p><p>A clear ringing of a sword; his spirit sword appeared again!</p><p>The sword light, like a rainbow, pierced towards the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang withdrew his spirit to his Purple Mansion, his body swayed, and the surrounding light suddenly became uncertain, flickering between light and dark. He summoned the Yin-Yang Armor from his Purple Mansion.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Yin-Yang Armor reverted to its essence of Yin-Yang energy, then transformed into a massive Yin-Yang hand, following the trail left by the sword light, reaching for the jade cage.</p><p>All obstacles were shattered by the Jinchen Sword, which also caused the jade cage to rapidly fade.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>The jade cage trembled slightly, an inexplicable resistance appeared within, preventing its timely concealment.  It hesitated for only a moment before the Yin-Yang hand seized it!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up; the Yin-Yang Armor had indeed triggered a reaction from the treasure inside.</p><p>The Cloud Pool's restrictions launched a frenzied counterattack, but it was too late.</p><p>The Yin-Yang hand immediately retreated.</p><p>The Jinchen Sword and the demonic fire provided protection, throwing the Cloud Pool into chaos, and successfully brought back the jade cage!</p><p>Having obtained the treasure, Qin Sang immediately retreated to the lower level, waiting for the Cloud Pool's restrictions to calm down before returning to the celestial pavilion.</p><p>The jade cage was now in his possession.</p><p>As expected, the jade cage's function was simple: to isolate and seal the treasure's fluctuations.  The other broken swords and blades had lost their power, rendering the cage unnecessary.</p><p>After some investigation, Qin Sang devised a method to open it.  He infused his spiritual sense into the jade cage, and with a ‘click’, it split open, revealing a lump of grayish-white light.</p><p>Within the grayish-white light was a piece of crude jade!</p><p>The jade was oval, rough-surfaced, with numerous spots, as if covered with a layer of unscraped stone skin, lacking any smoothness.</p><p>Layers of grayish-white light circles constantly emanated from within the jade.</p><p>The circles expanded outwards, gradually fading and disappearing.</p><p>Illuminated by the circles, Qin Sang felt no discomfort; he sensed a familiar fluctuation, originating from the same source as the Yin-Yang Armor, definitely related.</p><p>He refined Yin-Yang energy again, activating the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique."  Upon approach, the jade's light brightened significantly, and the fluctuations intensified, but that was all.</p><p>When he withdrew his Yin-Yang energy, the jade returned to normal.</p><p>Repeated attempts yielded the same result.</p><p>Even by using the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique" to activate the jade, he couldn't unleash any new power.</p><p>“This… Could it be because my mastery of this technique is too low?”</p><p>Qin Sang knew the technique was incomplete, so he abandoned it. Later, he also didn't try to steal the technique comprehended by the Yin-Yang Daoist.</p><p>“This object resonates with the Yin-Yang Dao, but lacks other miraculous properties.  The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect placing it in the Cloud Pool suggests a significant origin; it likely came from the Immortal Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>The incomplete technique ended up in the Cang Lang Sea, while the related treasure appeared in the Central Plains, likely due to the connection between the Immortal Palaces of the two regions.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't know the location of the Cang Lang Sea; otherwise, he could visit and inquire, and perhaps the Lan Dou Sect could shed some light.</p><p>Unable to discern its nature for the moment, Qin Sang stored the jade in his Qian Jun Ring.</p><p>“Cang Lang Sea… Tian Tong, Tian Xiang should have ascended together with the Zi Wei Palace.  The Qi Sha Hall is gone too, right?”</p><p>Qin Sang had this sudden thought.</p><p>The ascension of the Zi Wei Palace actually hinted at another path to ascension.</p><p>The ancient teleportation array within the Immortal Palace possessed unimaginable power, potentially breaking through the boundary barriers.</p><p>If the Qi Sha Hall remained, one could use its ancient teleportation array to travel to the Zi Wei Palace and leave this world!</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt this was unlikely, unlike the Ascension Platform and the East Sea Abyss.</p><p>With Tian Tong Hall and Tian Xiang Hall ascended, hope for this path was virtually nonexistent.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head lightly, dismissing distracting thoughts. He ascended the jade steps and reached the summit of the Lang Zhong building.</p><p>This level was simpler than the one below.</p><p>Four pillars supported the jade pavilion's roof.  Aside from these, there was no other furnishing.  A single meditation cushion rested on the smooth floor.</p><p>The cushion wasn't made of any rare or precious materials.</p><p>The only remarkable feature was the pavilion's dome.  The passage below resembled a starry sky, while here, a genuine starry sky was depicted, shimmering with starlight.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, then walked towards the cushion. After examining it for a moment, he sat cross-legged.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The instant he settled, the starlight on the dome brightened intensely, converging into a pillar of light that poured down upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt no threat and remained seated.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly on his shoulder took flight, circling him and guarding against any approach to the pavilion.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt as if he'd fallen into a sea of stars.</p><p>In reality, a strand of his consciousness had been drawn into an unknown space.  Within, countless orbs of light floated, some dazzlingly bright, most dim.</p><p>There weren't actually that many orbs; they simply swirled around his consciousness, creating the illusion of countless numbers.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously drifted towards one of the brighter orbs.</p><p>As soon as his consciousness touched it, a surge of information flowed into his mind.</p><p>The *Incomplete Scroll of the Nameless Alchemy Manual*!</p><p>It was a fragment of an alchemic treatise. The inheritance from the Water Phase Palace had left his avatar reeling, but this scroll was a true heavenly text. He could understand the ancient characters themselves, but the overall meaning eluded him.</p><p>Moreover, the scroll’s content was disjointed; memorizing it would require significant effort.</p><p>“The bright orbs all store various incomplete classics and scrolls!”</p><p>Qin Sang was not troubled but rather delighted. He’d finally found the right place.  The Lang Zhong building was a treasure trove; the lower levels held ancient artifacts of unknown origin, while the upper levels contained scriptures.</p><p>This was where the high-cultivation masters of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect cultivated their understanding. Even though they were fragments, these texts were all of great significance.  Comprehending even a small part could benefit one for a lifetime.</p><p>“Is the *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swordsmanship* here?”</p><p>Qin Sang rarely felt nervous, but this was different. The Lang Zhong building was his last hope.  Obtaining the cultivation technique would significantly influence his future path.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang withdrew his consciousness from the alchemic manual and began touching the other orbs, searching tirelessly.</p><p>*Incomplete Scroll of the Heavenly Attraction*.</p><p>*Nameless Cultivation Technique*.</p><p>*Method for Refining the Spirit Treasure Celestial Seal (Incomplete)*.</p><p>…</p><p>Orb after orb flashed by, a whirlwind of information. Most were various "Nameless" works and "Incomplete Scrolls," confirming Qin Sang’s suspicions.</p><p>In fact, only a select few incomplete scriptures were worthy of being placed within the Lang Zhong building. Most orbs contained nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned most of them, but he didn’t find what he wanted, and his mind tightened with anxiety.</p><p>He scanned another orb.</p><p>"An incomplete divine ability, not a cultivation technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang saw the name, disappointment etched on his face. He skipped the content and moved to the next orb. Upon seeing the name within, he instinctively held his breath.</p><p>*Nameless Sword Nurturing Technique*!</p><p>Sword Nurturing Technique!  Soul-Nurturing Swordsmanship Chapter!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He delved into the orb, and after glancing at the contents, his tense mind relaxed.</p><p>It was the *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swordsmanship*!</p><p>After years of searching, he finally had it, and so easily. He almost couldn't believe it, hoping it was only the Nascent Soul stage portion.</p><p>Composing himself, Qin Sang continued to browse the cultivation technique's contents.</p><p>He skimmed through it quickly.</p><p>“Eleventh layer! Good!”</p><p>“Twelfth layer…”</p><p>“Finished?”</p><p>Qin Sang froze, carefully examining the content again.  He realized he'd been hasty.</p><p>The first ten layers of the *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swordsmanship* were foundational.  Each minor realm from Foundation Establishment onward corresponded to a layer.</p><p>The technique was divided into two parts, each with five layers.</p><p>Beyond Nascent Soul, the pattern changed. The eleventh layer covered the entire Nascent Soul stage, and the twelfth, incredibly, covered the astonishing Void Refinement stage!</p><p>At the very least, it was a cultivation technique that pointed directly towards the Void Refinement Dao!</p><p>When the Wuxiang Immortal Sect obtained the technique, they lacked the pre-Nascent Soul portion, making comprehension extremely difficult.  Furthermore, the technique was clearly unorthodox, using the soul to nurture the sword. No one dared to attempt it.</p><p>However, because these two parts involved such high levels, they were placed within the Lang Zhong building, and in the most important positions at the back.</p><p>With the technique in hand, Qin Sang didn't rush to study it—his cultivation was insufficient anyway.  He continued browsing the other orbs, hoping to find higher levels of the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique*.</p><p>Unfortunately, after reaching the end, although he found another incomplete scroll pointing to the Void Refinement realm, this technique was not amongst them.</p>
