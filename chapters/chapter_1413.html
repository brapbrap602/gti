<h1>Chapter 1405: The Buddhist Sect Appears</h1><p>Chapter 1405: The Buddhist Sect Appears</p><p>The four stared intently at the red glow.</p><p>They felt a wave of intense heat emanating from it, causing the surrounding seawater to boil.</p><p>The scene before them was unexpected.  Their joy vanished, replaced by puzzled looks at each other.</p><p>They had expected to find a door or the full extent of a sealing formation after attacking this point, not this.</p><p>It seemed to be an active underground magma vein, not the Buddhist sect ruins they'd anticipated.</p><p>Just as the four were bewildered,</p><p>the red glow suddenly stopped spreading and rapidly contracted inward.  The intense heat was suppressed, and the formation was about to return to its original state in the blink of an eye.</p><p>If the red glow disappeared, their attack would have been in vain.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede couldn't hold on for much longer.</p><p>Regardless, they had to enter the Jing Hai Sect before the insect formation dissipated.</p><p>Seeing this,</p><p>Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances.</p><p>"Continue!"</p><p>Master Mu shouted.</p><p>The snake spear emitted a cold,幽幽 light, like a python resurrected.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed.  Having already sacrificed the Fire Jade Centipede, he had no reason to give up, regardless of whether this was the Jing Hai Sect or not.</p><p>He decisively pushed his Golden Submersion Sword to its limit, transforming it into a golden rainbow.</p><p>Qi and Wang moved just as swiftly, their flag formation swirling as a more condensed azure water sword appeared.</p><p>The four Nascent Soul cultivators held nothing back.</p><p>Black, gold, blue.</p><p>Only three beams of light were visible to the naked eye, converging at a single point in an instant. The four Nascent Soul cultivators' control was exquisite, their attack compressed to the extreme before erupting the moment it touched the red glow!</p><p>What followed was beyond anyone's expectation.</p><p>The red glow ceased its contraction, pausing briefly before surging outwards in all directions at an even faster speed than before, causing the seawater to boil once more.</p><p>Simultaneously, an extremely violent fiery aura burst forth, unleashed after being suppressed for countless years, finally freed with the help of Qin Sang and the others!</p><p>Feeling the power of this aura, Qin Sang and the others' faces changed.</p><p>They didn't dare to charge forward, instead retreating unanimously to avoid the brunt of it.</p><p>At the same time,</p><p>the formation's outline finally appeared, stimulated by the red glow.</p><p>Wherever the red glow passed, faint golden Buddhist light appeared out of thin air. Each beam of light formed a thin, almost invisible barrier, layer upon layer.</p><p>When all the Buddhist light appeared, the resulting image was extraordinary.</p><p>The barriers formed by the Buddhist light coalesced into an unopened lotus flower, tightly closed!</p><p>The lotus bud was the entirety of the formation.</p><p>The red glow raged within the lotus.</p><p>The Buddhist light was dazzling, competing with the red glow.</p><p>Only red and gold light filled their vision. Only Qin Sang, aided by his Sky-Eyed Butterfly, could vaguely see something unusual at the center of the red glow.</p><p>That was likely the entrance to the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>However, neither Qin Sang nor Master Mu dared to approach the lotus at this moment, instead cautiously retreating to observe.</p><p>"Could this just be an underwater magma vein?"</p><p>The Qi cultivator murmured.</p><p>"It can't be that simple," the Wang cultivator shook her head.  "Why would the Jing Hai Sect be built on a soon-to-erupt underwater magma vein? And if the magma vein were to erupt, why wouldn't they relocate instead of expending so much effort to seal it?"</p><p>…</p><p>They anxiously watched the changes within the lotus, exchanging words.</p><p>Various thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and a sudden ominous feeling gripped him. He turned and asked, "How many Nascent Soul cultivators are near the Empty Spirit Sea?"</p><p>"There aren't many good places in the Boundless Sea. Nascent Soul cultivation grounds are far apart, generally keeping to themselves. Besides us, only the island's head abbot, Jie Zhenren, from Nine Precepts Island.  What's on your mind, Daoist?"</p><p>The Qi cultivator looked at him in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to the lotus, "I want to know, if news leaks, how many people will be drawn here? How quickly will they arrive?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking,</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A sudden thunderclap echoed from within the lotus.</p><p>The clash between the red glow and the lotus reached its peak.</p><p>The lotus trembled, and under the Buddhist light, the surroundings transformed into a sea of gold. But the aura of the red glow was no less intense, perhaps even more so, breaking through layer after layer of the Buddhist light barriers.</p><p>Amidst the thunder, the lotus shattered!</p><p>In an instant, a wave of red and gold light shot outwards in all directions at visible speed.</p><p>"No good! Scatter!"</p><p>Feeling the power of the wave, the four's faces instantly turned grave.</p><p>A surge of intense, pent-up fiery energy, combined with the shattering of the Buddha Lotus Formation, created a volatile mixture.  If struck by it, they would likely face certain death.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Four figures breached the surface, soaring into the air, their faces etched with shock as they stared ahead.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A colossal pillar of fiery gold light erupted towards the heavens.</p><p>Its scale and intensity far surpassed any phenomenon the Qi cultivators had previously witnessed.</p><p>The four looked up, unable to see the light's end.  Far from diminishing, the pillar intensified.  Gigantic waves crashed.  The tranquility of the Empty Spirit Sea was shattered.</p><p>Their expressions shifted, mirroring Qin Sang's growing apprehension.  The two forces showed no sign of weakening; they were powerless to suppress them.  If this continued, cultivators miles away would be alerted by the spectacle.</p><p>News like this would spread rapidly across the vast expanse of the Boundless Sea, attracting other Yuan Ying stage cultivators.</p><p>Fortunately, it would take them time to arrive, giving Qin Sang and the others a head start in reaching the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>In the distance, the Hun Mo Elder and the Chi Jie Real Person observed the scene.</p><p>Chi Jie Real Person was momentarily stunned, realizing that if they didn't find a way in quickly, the ensuing conflict would involve far more than just the four cultivators.  He felt a surge of relief at his foresight in summoning Hun Mo Elder.</p><p>Hun Mo Elder, however, fixed his gaze on the golden pillar, his eyes darkening with a sinister gleam.</p><p>"Good for nothing, only causing trouble!"</p><p>He snorted angrily, striking his black bamboo staff hard against the ground.</p><p>Chi Jie Real Person looked at him in surprise, unsure what caused his outburst.</p><p>…</p><p>"What do we do now?"</p><p>Qi and Wang both turned to the Mu Valley Master.</p><p>A wry smile played on their lips. "All our efforts… were we just paving the way for others?"</p><p>The Mu Valley Master pondered, diving to investigate before resurfacing with a slight shake of his head.  "The colliding forces are intensifying; it's impossible to see what lies beneath.  Even if we forced our way in, we'd be facing almost certain death."</p><p>"Entering now means certain death!"</p><p>Qin Sang interjected, his gaze fixed on the seabed. "There are bound to be more dangers below the entrance, such as a protective formation! Our only course of action is to wait for the fiery energy to subside before trying again.  Otherwise, while battling the fiery energy and facing other threats, even the four of us combined couldn't survive."</p>
