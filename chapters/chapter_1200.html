<h1>Chapter 1192: Progress</h1><p>Chapter 1192: Progress</p><p>Cultivating the mind, refining the Dao heart.</p><p>Every cultivator dares not underestimate this stage of their cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang experiences fluctuating desires and thoughts, but his core remains unlost, free from inner demons.  He even bypassed the heart demon tribulation during his Nascent Soul ascension.</p><p>For now, this is certainly good news.</p><p>Qin Sang has bypassed the hurdle of confronting inner demons, saving him the effort of searching for such rare treasures.  His breakthrough and cultivation speed will undoubtedly be much faster.</p><p>But Qin Sang doesn't know how long the jade Buddha can protect him.</p><p>When the jade Buddha's protection is gone, will his Dao heart, never tempered by inner demons, still hold firm?</p><p>Therefore, he doesn't dare to act recklessly.  Even without heart demons, he can't relax, although refining his Dao heart will be much easier, and he won't have to live in constant fear and anxiety like other cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang never imagined that the jade Buddha, which suppresses heart demons, would one day become an obstacle.</p><p>He tries to stir up his desires using the "Unsurpassed Demon Seal" technique, attempting to induce inner demons.</p><p>The inner landscape remains as still as a placid lake, undisturbed.</p><p>No inner demons arise, so how can one speak of a demon seal?</p><p>"Unsurpassed Demon Seal, Unsurpassed Demon Seal, on me, it truly is 'unborn'..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighs inwardly.</p><p>He gently strokes the jade slip, temporarily at a loss. He puts this demonic technique aside.</p><p>However, the technique wasn't obtained for nothing. Since his senior sister had cultivated it, the technique itself does have the effect of breaking through barriers. Given time, it’s worth studying, perhaps to gain some understanding of its essence.</p><p>The purpose of a cultivator's travels is to broaden their horizons and learn from each other's experience.</p><p>After sitting still for a while, Qin Sang gets up and leaves the side hall.</p><p>He leaves the City Lord's Mansion, concealing his aura, and quietly comes to an abandoned courtyard in the city.</p><p>After a short while, a figure quietly enters; it is Mei Gu.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>Mei Gu, having received news, arrives in haste.</p><p>Receiving personal instruction from Qin Sang, she clarifies previous mistakes, and her cultivation shows marked progress.</p><p>Qin Sang tells Mei Gu to rise.  Seeing her improved cultivation, he nods slightly and says in a low voice, "How many disciples were killed or injured in the recent battle?"</p><p>"Reporting to Master, after I delivered the message to Elder Leng, I was secretly protected by the Elder. In this battle, only a few disciples were slightly injured…"</p><p>Mei Gu reports in detail.</p><p>She is inwardly curious.  She has been secretly collecting information about the Nascent Soul cultivators from both regions and still isn't certain of her master's true identity.</p><p>Being close friends with the Sect Leader Leng of Yuan Shen Sect, he is most likely a righteous senior, but she doesn't know which Grandmaster he is.</p><p>After listening to Mei Gu's report, Qin Sang nods slightly and asks again, "How is the task I gave you progressing?"</p><p>Mei Gu's expression sharpens, knowing this is the real reason her master has summoned her. Fortunately, she has always treated this as her top priority and has never been lax.</p><p>"After arriving at Stone Curve Mountain, I managed to befriend cultivators from the Azure Yang Demon Sect and obtained some information about the Divine Gang Peak. After the Azure Yang Demon Sect Sect Leader's Nascent Soul ascension, he closed himself off on Divine Gang Peak for a whole year. Upon emerging, a thick azure mist rose from Divine Gang Peak, enveloping the entire summit. The phantom of the Ancestral Sacred Fire was also shrouded in this mist, and the previous turbulent, violent aura has completely disappeared…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sinks upon hearing this.</p><p>Could it be that the Azure Yang Demon Sect Sect Leader was able to subdue the Ancestral Sacred Fire right after his Nascent Soul ascension?</p><p>The aura of the Divine Gang Peak Ancestral Sacred Fire is not inferior to the Winter Nether Cold Flame. Qin Sang thought he would need at least to be at the mid-Nascent Soul stage to accomplish this.</p><p>There's only one explanation: the Ancestral Sacred Fire is actually the Azure Yang Demon Fire left behind by an ancestor of the Azure Yang Demon Sect.  A later-generation cultivator practicing the same technique could thus refine it easily.</p><p>Qin Sang remembers that the Azure Yang Demon Sect's cultivation techniques are special. If cultivation fails, the deceased disciple would leave behind a demonic fire seed, which others can refine to enhance their cultivation, a great boon.</p><p>This is also why the righteous sects don't recognize the Azure Yang Demon Sect.</p><p>This is somewhat troublesome.</p><p>If the Azure Yang Demon Sect Sect Leader couldn't resolve the Ancestral Sacred Fire, there was still room for negotiation. But if he has already subdued it, why would he give it up?</p><p>His strength is probably far beyond what rumors suggest.</p><p>Unless there is some treasure he can't refuse, other methods won't work.</p><p>Should I look for another spiritual fire?</p><p>Qin Sang frowns inwardly.</p><p>He originally wanted to meet this Demon Sect Sect Leader, but the man was sent out by True One Daoist to patrol, causing him to miss the opportunity.</p><p>Mei Gu is unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts and continues to report on the information she has gathered, "There is one strange thing. After the Sect Leader came down the mountain, he strictly forbade all disciples at the late Foundation Establishment stage and above from going up the mountain to absorb Azure Yang Gang Jade. Every so often, the sect distributes it uniformly for their cultivation."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flash.</p><p>This is quite strange.</p><p>The purest divine energy, Qing Yang Gang Yu, was once readily available.</p><p>When he infiltrated the Qing Yang Demon Sect, the Ancestor Saint Fire, though already extremely volatile and chaotic, still allowed disciples to absorb its energy within the mountain.</p><p>However, they couldn't absorb it freely near the summit, or it would cause a catastrophic eruption.</p><p>Now, they're not even allowed to go up the mountain.</p><p>This doesn't look like an attempt to subdue the Ancestor Saint Fire at all.</p><p>“Recently, I befriended a fellow cultivator, a highly regarded direct disciple of the Qing Yang Demon Sect’s Master. She must know many secrets, but she’s very suspicious.  I’m afraid of arousing her suspicions, so I haven’t dared to ask too much. I need more time to build trust with her…”</p><p>Mei Gu finished her report, feeling uneasy and worried about her master's displeasure.</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, knowing that such matters couldn't be rushed. Mei Gu had already done remarkably well.  “These pills are newly acquired. They can enhance the cultivation of Golden Core cultivators. Your task is simply to gather information; avoid unnecessary risks. Don't rush, and always prioritize your safety.”</p><p>He wasn't stingy with his rewards. He produced a jade bottle containing pills obtained from Pei Laomo's belongings.</p><p>“Thank you, Master!”</p><p>Seeing that her master not only hadn't punished her but also cared for her well-being, Mei Gu’s fear lessened, and her gratitude felt more genuine.</p><p>After Mei Gu left, Qin Sang transformed back into his demon king form and returned to Sandie Pass with the little demons from Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Jing Lin and Si Di were considerate and arranged for the little demons without Qin Sang needing to instruct them.  The old monkey quickly returned to the mountains to relay orders.</p><p>The war raged on, with occasional skirmishes at other passes.  Only Sandie Mountain remained unusually calm.</p><p>Zui Yuan seemed to find it too difficult to attack, abandoning plans to break through there.</p><p>Jing Lin and Si Di took a different approach, launching a preemptive strike. They discovered Chan Ling’s camp a hundred miles from Sandie Pass, personally guarded by Chan Ling, making a direct assault extremely challenging.</p><p>After several skirmishes, both sides eventually ceased their attacks.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang, as agreed, presided over the Hanling Formation and remained in the tall building, barely leaving, allowing his cultivation to progress.</p><p>Seven sword souls were nearing complete integration with his seven spirits.</p><p>He had been closely monitoring Shaohua Mountain and recently received confirmation that Mu Yifeng, Che Yutao, Qiu Mubai, and others, who usually spent years in seclusion, had not appeared on the battlefield since the war began.</p>
