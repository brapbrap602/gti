<h1>Chapter 2055: Desperate Flight</h1><p>“My two fellow cultivators have already demonstrated their abilities to me.  It would be impossible for me alone to perfectly replicate both of them simultaneously without detection; even a few exchanges would reveal the ruse, especially given the old attendant's far superior cultivation. However, if Brother Ji fully deploys the array Master Quan taught, and with your assistance, we should be able to deceive everyone.”</p><p>The man in white robes finished speaking, a puff of white smoke erupted from him. His figure distorted, quickly fading and merging with the smoke. The smoke abruptly coalesced, a void seemingly appearing in the air, sucking the smoke inside, leaving only a white speck.</p><p>Then, the smoke poured out of the void again, but this time it split into two streams.  Amidst the swirling smoke, two figures materialized. They had different faces and their clothing bore no resemblance to the white-robed man.</p><p>One had wolf ears, belonging to the same race as Jiliang, clearly a member of the Quanfeng tribe.</p><p>The other, a woman, wore sturdy attire; valiant and spirited. Her features were indistinguishable from a human, but she possessed a long, furry tail.</p><p>Initially, both appeared stiff, like lifeless statues, but in the blink of an eye their eyes became bright and lively.  Judging by their expressions, movements, flesh, and fur, they were undeniably two living people, without a single flaw.</p><p>Not only were they lifelike, but their auras were also completely different, both possessing the early stages of Sky Realm Double cultivation, equivalent to the early stages of Void Refinement. It was inconceivable that they were created from a single person.</p><p>Jiliang examined them, circling the Quanfeng tribesman. He clicked his tongue in amazement, "Your abilities are truly extraordinary, Brother. I've spent many years with Jiqiong, and if I hadn't known beforehand, I might have mistaken this for the real Jiqiong."</p><p>The woman said nothing, leaping into the clouds and disappearing in an instant.</p><p>The Quanfeng tribesman chuckled with a raspy voice, "I am Jiqiong!"</p><p>Jiliang nodded, glancing downwards, and said in a low voice, "Jiqiong, everything is ready. You will control the array. Do you have any further instructions?"</p><p>Jiqiong's ears twitched. "To prevent the leakage of aura, it's best that we provide support from the side. You should take the lead in the attack, and shoulder the majority of the pressure."</p><p>"No problem!"</p><p>Jiliang waved his hand, confident.  "The younger one has likely just broken through to Sky Realm Double not long ago; he's insignificant.  The older one, while having late Sky Realm Double cultivation, has endured countless battles during their escape. When the three of us attacked them last time, we almost drove them to their wits' end, forcing them to use their mutual transformation technique, depleting their energy considerably. They are at their weakest. Not much time has passed since our last confrontation, so they can't have recovered much."</p><p>Despite this, Jiqiong remained cautious. "They are, after all, from the Siyou Royal Family, and may still possess hidden methods."</p><p>"If they had such a method, and have kept it unused until now, it must come at great cost. Unless they are cornered, they would hesitate to use it. We simply need to employ a strategy of prolonged combat and attrition, forcing them to expend their energy again and resort to their mutual transformation with their last companion beast, cutting off their escape route.  Then they will be weakened even further, and then it will be up to Master Quan," Jiliang was confident and showed no concern.</p><p>Jiqiong, seeing that everything had been considered, nodded.  "Two weakened individuals, Master Quan will have no fear of them.  However, Master Quan needs them alive, so we must wear them down as much as possible."</p><p>As they communicated through their minds, they sensed two auras rushing towards them from above.</p><p>Jiliang sneered, "So they dare to take the initiative!"</p><p>Jiqiong’s expression changed slightly. He bowed slightly, and like the woman before, he vanished into the clouds.</p><p>Jiliang was alone, calmly watching the two streaks of rainbow light as if they were already dead men.</p><p>The two revealed their true forms, their auras unrestrained, and a powerful oppressive force descended upon the sea.  Even those ascending into the heavens could feel it, filling nearby creatures with terror and dread.</p><p>The power they felt was unlike anything they had ever experienced. When their patriarch, Tingfu, occasionally patrolled the area, he would never openly release such pressure.  They felt like mere ants and the islands beneath their feet were equally insignificant, easily destroyed by the opponents with a flick of their wrist.</p><p>The rainbow lights soared into the heavens, relentlessly. Yet, Jiliang saw their feigned strength and sneered again. He opened his hand and pressed it down.</p><p>Instantly, dark clouds swirled, and boundless clouds gathered beneath him, forming a gigantic, dark hand.</p><p>The colossal hand obscured the sky, visible to all creatures on the nearby islands. Each finger was like a pillar of heaven, radiating terrifying power capable of destroying worlds, descending towards the earth.</p><p>They had no doubt that if the hand fell, all the islands and creatures would be obliterated in an instant. They were helpless, unable to escape the giant hand's grasp.</p><p>Facing the overwhelming giant palm, the two beams of rainbow light seemed insignificant.  On the verge of being extinguished, they suddenly erupted with intense, dark blue light, thick and rippling like dark water across the heavens.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The void seemed to tremble.  All living beings heard a deafening roar like crashing waves.  Then, two enormous silhouettes appeared in the sky – two enormous whale-like creatures!</p><p>The companion beasts of the Siyou clan are not mere figments of imagination; they must be based on real creatures. If powerful creatures are chosen, their essence must be obtained. Within the Mist Sea, nine-tenths of the land is ocean, so the Siyou clan often chooses sea creatures as companions.</p><p>Sea behemoths such as dragons and sharks are highly favored, but the Siyou royal family primarily chooses a type of whale-like creature called the Buttian Whale.</p><p>The temporary dissipation of a companion beast through the Mutual Transformation technique is different from it being forcibly destroyed by an enemy.  A destroyed companion beast is completely lost until it is reformed. Currently, they can only temporarily not use the Mutual Transformation technique; they can still utilize their companion beast’s power in battle.</p><p>At this moment, the young master and Xia Changshi both transformed into Buttian Whales. Two huge whales, one large and one small, hung in the air, their bodies so long that their heads and tails could not be seen simultaneously.  Their enormous mouths emitted a mournful cry that echoed through the underworld.</p><p>“Moo!”</p><p>Those below only heard two sounds like bull roars.  They stared blankly at the sky as the two whales, moving in unison, charged towards the giant palm.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The giant palm cracked, then shattered. The dark clouds above were churned, the wind howled, and dark waves surged, creating chaos and completely obscuring the view of those below.</p><p>This earth-shattering collision, however, produced surprisingly little aftershock. Spiritual energy was blocked, leaving the Haitang Academy completely unaware.</p><p>Seeing his plan succeed, Jiliang relaxed, preparing to focus on his powerful opponent.  But his ears twitched, sensing something amiss. He discovered that both Buttian Whales were merely illusory skins, and the two Siyou clan members were gone.</p><p>Jiliang remained calm, producing an object from his sleeve and throwing it towards a part of the cloudy sea.</p><p>A black streak of light shot downwards.  The object within the light revealed itself to be a black jade pendant.</p><p>As it fell, the jade pendant grew to the size of a mountain, incredibly heavy.</p><p>At that moment, sounds of air-splitting broke out from both sides.  One gray and one white chain pierced the heavy clouds, their other ends connected to the depths of the cloudy sea, manipulated by unseen hands towards the falling jade pendant.</p><p>Three attacks converged, an unparalleled pressure locking down the cloudy sea beforehand.  The void twisted slightly, forcing the two Siyou clan members to reappear, only to transform into two demon birds.</p><p>This time, their companion beasts were different.</p><p>The young master's companion beast was a crimson-feathered demon bird.  Though not large, it was slender with a long neck, sharp beak, and streamlined body.  With its wings folded, it resembled a long arrow.</p><p>Xia Changshi's companion beast was a bone bird. This bird wasn’t fleshless; rather, its flesh was contained within its bones.  Its white bones were exposed, forming a hard bony armor, like a skeletal bird. It was huge, its outstretched wings rivaling those of the Buttian Whale.</p><p>The bone bird spread its massive wings, easily shielding the crimson-feathered bird beneath it, seemingly willing to bear the brunt of the three attacks alone.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The jade pendant and chains struck.  A rattling sound, like clashing metal rings, emanated from the bone bird.  Silver gleamed in multiple places on its body; actual iron rings connected its bone seams, adding a layer of ringed armor to its bony carapace.</p><p>With a deafening crash, the three attacks hit the bone bird simultaneously. The bone bird plummeted, emitting a shrill cry, its entire body erupting in intense light.</p><p>When the light faded, some of the bone bird’s iron rings were shattered, but it stubbornly continued to protect the crimson-feathered bird, flying forward.</p><p>“Trying to escape?”</p><p>Jiliang sneered, surprised by their sudden retreat after their initial aggressive stance.</p><p>He cast a spell, the jade pendant firmly suppressing the iron rings on the bone bird, while the two chains once again shot out, changing tactics. They hooked onto individual rings and tightened.</p><p>Their forward momentum checked, the bone bird made an unexpected move, shaking its body and actively shedding all its iron rings.</p><p>This was expected by Jil and his associates. As he manipulated the jade pendant, a chanted incantation sounded, emanating from his ears.</p><p>The bone bird, just freed from its restraints, felt an immediate sense of danger.  Its body was then enveloped in a crimson light.</p><p>Above it, the void turned blood-red, a bizarre blood-red diagram appearing seemingly out of nowhere, descending towards its back.</p><p>The danger didn't end there. A dark tide rose from the left, its aura of decay constantly assaulting it.  To the right, a single silver gleam appeared, far more formidable than the other two attacks – a silver arrow piercing the air.</p><p>Having fought them before, Xia Changshi knew the potency of these three attacks and his body stiffened slightly.</p><p>Jil smiled confidently, sure he could force his opponents back. Unexpectedly, the actions of the two Siyou clan members took them completely by surprise.</p><p>The bone bird roared, its bone armor changing from white to crimson in an instant.  Blood flames surged as Xia Changshi began burning his own life essence.  When the blood diagram descended, not only did it fail to have its intended effect, it seemed to fuel the flames, which instantly swelled.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The dark tide and silver arrow were absorbed by the blood flames without causing any ripples. The two became a ball of fire, fleeing at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Jil's face changed, a mixture of shock and anger.  The desperate actions of the enemy at the very first engagement were illogical. They clearly had a way to retreat; such a move would only weaken them, resulting in a net loss.</p><p>Had Elder Quan misjudged? Had the opponents' spirit beasts scattered, leaving them with no escape?</p><p>Or was this a tactic to frighten them away?</p><p>Regardless, they had to stop them; they couldn't let them escape.  Even with Elder Quan watching, they would lose face, and it would also attract people from Haitang Academy.</p><p>Thinking this, Jil sent out a voice transmission, his ears fluttering as grey ripples spread outward. The ripples moved incredibly fast, expanding to cover the blood flames above.</p><p>Jil remained motionless, focusing all his energy on his divine ability.  The ripples in the void became increasingly prominent and urgent.</p><p>This was not just his power alone. The white-robed man, who had split into two, was also using the formation to assist him. Two more figures appeared faintly in the void, flanking Jil in a pincer movement, encircling the blood flames.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>The blood flames were at the very center of the vortex, bombarded by waves of ripples.</p><p>No matter how fast the blood flames moved, the vortex remained, preventing Xia Changshi and his master from escaping its center.  Jil and the white-robed man's energy and the ripples were intertwined, moving with the vortex.</p><p>The next moment, the three figures flickered, teleporting, and when they reappeared, they were closer to the center of the vortex.</p><p>Simultaneously, the pressure on Xia Changshi increased dramatically, slowing his escape.</p><p>As the three continued to flicker, the ripples became almost tangible, and the pressure at the vortex's center reached a terrifying level, slowing the blood flames.</p><p>"Time to use the mutual transformation technique, right?"</p><p>Jil watched the blood flames coldly, unconvinced that Xia Changshi would continue his futile struggle.</p><p>His assumption proved correct. Seeing that escape was impossible, the intensity of the blood flames lessened, and Xia Changshi seemed to cease burning his life essence.</p><p>But the next moment, the blood flames exploded!</p><p>Jil was engulfed by the crimson light, watching the scene with disbelief. He could feel that Xia Changshi had ignited all his remaining life essence.</p><p>Within the blood flames…</p><p>The bone bird lowered its head, looking at the Crimson-feathered Bird.  In its forehead was a crystal resembling an eye, glowing intensely red, having absorbed almost all of Xia Changshi's life essence.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The Crimson-feathered Bird heard a shout. Its eyes filled with tears as it performed the mutual transformation technique, disappearing instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, the crystal shattered, shooting out countless beams of crimson light, instantly shattering the vortex. The three figures were too slow to dodge and were swallowed by the light.</p><p>The bone bird showed a relieved expression.  Unfortunately, it was too weak, and even sacrificing the treasure it brought from its clan was unlikely to kill all its enemies here.  However, the most important thing was that the enemy would believe that they had died bravely, their lord together with them.</p><p>This would allow the young lord to escape.</p><p>As consciousness faded, the bone bird suddenly saw two figures, as if dissolving into bubbles, vanish after being struck by the crimson light.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Even if those two were only at the early stage of the Sky Realm, Double-Heaven cultivation, they shouldn't have been so weak, offering no resistance and being killed instantly.</p><p>Unless…</p><p>The bone bird's pupils dilated, suddenly understanding something. It gave a bitter smile, filled with despair, and lost consciousness completely.</p>
