<h1>Chapter 2257: Azure Sky Thunder</h1><p>“Is Azure Sky Void within these azure clouds?”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the horizon.</p><p>Distant mountains were like dark eyebrows, possessing a tranquility absent elsewhere. The sky was azure, but not a clear, bright blue; instead, faint azure clouds drifted.  These clouds hung high in the air, unchanging for years, a dreamlike scene, yet without effect on the creatures below.</p><p>The interior of Azure Sky Void was invisible from the outside.  Qin Sang sensed no guardian presence nearby, so he could only wait for the guidance of the mysterious Azure-plumed Bird to enter the secret realm.</p><p>While waiting, Qin Sang didn't abandon his cultivation of the Water-Fire Harmony technique. The opportunity was rare, and he hoped to deepen his understanding of Yin-Yang principles within the illusion, though he doubted he could catch up with his progress in the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>Qin Sang understood priorities. The main task came first; the extent of his Yin-Yang advancement would depend on the unfolding situation.</p><p>After three months of waiting, Qin Sang finally heard the mysterious Azure-plumed Bird's voice, “You… broke through?”</p><p>Receiving Qin Sang's affirmative reply, the mysterious Azure-plumed Bird exclaimed in approval.</p><p>Not long ago, Qin Sang had sensed an opportunity to breakthrough.  However, this didn’t guarantee success; decades of seclusion were not uncommon, yet Qin Sang achieved it so quickly.</p><p>This further strengthened its confidence in him.  Qin Sang's increased strength would greatly improve his chances of entering Azure Sky Void.</p><p>“Tell…me…your…current…location…”</p><p>Guided by the mysterious Azure-plumed Bird, Qin Sang acted. He approached the clouds, but not too closely.  He then circled the edge, reaching the north side.</p><p>The view was much the same from any direction.  Even with Qin Sang's eyesight and spiritual perception, he could only vaguely sense the fluctuations of the formations within the clouds, and slight differences in two directions.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, listening intently, his gaze sweeping across the area before settling on a point.</p><p>Following the Azure-plumed Bird's instructions, he formed a hand seal, a faint silver glow appearing on his fingertip. He struck himself with it.</p><p>The silver light washed over him like water.  With each sweep, Qin Sang's form faded slightly.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly performed the hand seals, his form becoming increasingly fainter until he vanished, secretly flying towards the clouds.</p><p>Under the protection of this technique, Qin Sang passed through without hindrance, entering the clouds effortlessly and without causing any disturbance.</p><p>Qin Sang now knew that the guardian resided within the clouds year-round. The entire cloud formation was a massive array's manifestation.  Throughout the Azure-plumed Bird clan, few knew the array’s secrets; the mysterious Azure-plumed Bird was one of them.</p><p>However, it couldn't directly help Qin Sang; even getting him inside required considerable effort.</p><p>Qin Sang moved slowly through the clouds. The scenery began to change, shifting into various bizarre and fantastical sights; occasionally, an Azure-plumed Bird would circle overhead.</p><p>These birds seemed almost real, like sacred guardians, but were actually illusions created by the array. This was the first layer of defense; all the Azure-plumed Bird guards ignored Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang proceeded cautiously, flying past them, until a large river blocked his path. The water was made of azure clouds, but unlike the calm exterior; here, the clouds churned violently.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that entering would instantly pulverize him. Without the mysterious Azure-plumed Bird’s guidance, he wouldn't have dared to attempt it.</p><p>He stopped by the riverbank and consulted the mysterious Azure-plumed Bird, learning he'd passed the first array and reached the second.</p><p>“The…previously…transmitted…formation…”</p><p>The communication between the mysterious Azure-plumed Bird and Qin Sang remained unaffected by the array. Moreover, as Qin Sang’s cultivation increased, the sound became clearer.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, recalling a formation the bird had previously imparted. It was to be used here.</p><p>The formation was extremely complex, but Qin Sang was no ordinary person and had already mastered it.  He began to inscribe runes on his own body, using himself as a medium.  The runes covered almost his entire body. Finally, activating the formation, Qin Sang trembled, emitting a brilliant azure light, transforming into a small azure fish.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his tail, leaping into the river.</p><p>The river remained turbulent and dangerous, yet Qin Sang was like a fish in water.  He swam upstream, resolutely moving towards the river's source, where he leaped out of the water, reverting to his human form.</p><p>After repeatedly navigating treacherous formations, Qin Sang, guided by the mysterious Qingluan, successfully passed through three more.  While he escaped unscathed, the experience was a significant test. His performance, however, far exceeded the Qingluan's expectations, earning its praise.</p><p>"Senior, I see the forest you mentioned."</p><p>After passing another formation, the scenery before Qin Sang shifted, his expression turning grave as he described his surroundings to the Qingluan.</p><p>"You... see... what...?"</p><p>Qin Sang gazed ahead.  An endless forest filled his vision, ancient trees towering over a silent, windless landscape that filled him with unease.  Even stranger, all the leaves were a vibrant red, like burning flames, mirroring the red clouds in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang relayed his observations.</p><p>"Red clouds... how thick?"</p><p>"Almost a foot," Qin Sang replied, squinting.</p><p>"Good luck...!"</p><p>The Qingluan seemed relieved, then instructed Qin Sang on how to break through the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang then learned that this formation wasn't static; it operated according to certain patterns.  The appearance, timing, and solution varied drastically.  The nearly foot-thick red clouds indicated an impending shift in the formation, which would trigger a tremor.</p><p>Qin Sang had stealthily reached his limit. Further progress risked alerting the guardians; he had to use the formation's shifts to mask his movements.  Even so, it was incredibly difficult, with only a fleeting window of opportunity.</p><p>Despite his recent advancement in cultivation, time was short, and the Qingluan worried his inexperience might lead to mistakes. The red clouds meant the next shift would cause the most violent tremor, offering a better chance of success.</p><p>Standing on a red tree, Qin Sang listened intently to the instructions.  Breaking the formation involved several steps. The Qingluan advised that if Qin Sang felt overwhelmed, he could break it down, hiding and advancing with each tremor, for greater safety.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't want to wait. He planned to push through in one go!</p><p>He stared at the red clouds, calculating the time.  After ten days, the clouds were an inch thicker.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The forest burst into flames, a raging inferno consuming the red clouds, threatening to incinerate everything.  Without hesitation, Qin Sang plunged into the fire.</p><p>Elsewhere in the formation...</p><p>A palace floated in mid-air, unsupported, surrounded by nothingness.  Inside, a Qingluan slept.</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang entered the fire, the Qingluan suddenly opened its eyes, a flicker of confusion crossing them.  Its gaze seemed to penetrate the palace, seeing deep into the formation.</p><p>"I've been asleep for so long..."</p><p>Sensing the shift in the formation, it relaxed, muttering to itself.  After calculating the time, it sighed,  "Thirty years until I can leave... I'll continue sleeping!"  With that, it settled into a more comfortable position and fell back asleep.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, through daring maneuvers, seized the brief opportunity, successfully breaking through several formations. When he reported back to the Qingluan, it marveled at his audacity.</p><p>But without that courage, how could he have dared to be such a lone hero?</p><p>The Qingluan asked, "Around... are there... clouds...?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "I'm in the clouds, similar to the outer clouds."</p><p>All this effort seemed to bring him back to the starting point.</p><p>"Down!"</p><p>Looking down, Qin Sang saw nothing at first, but as he descended rapidly, mountain ranges came into view.  He landed on a mountain and was immediately drawn to another mountain in the distance.</p><p>Shrouded in clouds, it was blurry, yet clearly significant, exuding a mystical aura.  Qin Sang sensed it might be the heart of Qingxiao Bixu.</p><p>Though far away, separated by further formations, both Qin Sang and the Qingluan knew he'd reached his limit.</p><p>"Hide! Use... that artifact..."</p><p>At the Qingluan's command, Qin Sang produced a jade-green, bowl-shaped artifact, forged at the Qingluan's request.  Even having crafted it, Qin Sang didn't know its purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang carved out a cave and placed a jade-green bowl on his knees.  Before, no matter how hard he tried, the bowl remained inert. Now, he felt a difference.</p><p>He sensed something being drawn to the bowl, drifting in from the depths of the Azure Void.  Meanwhile, bluish smoke emanated from the bowl, filling the cave and seeping outwards.  </p><p>Soon, the bowl vibrated. Qin Sang looked down; electrical sparks flickered within, and a strand of lightning appeared. He picked it up; it was blue-green, reminding him of the Azure Luan True Thunder.</p><p>"Senior, what kind of lightning is this?"</p><p>"Azure Void Lightning…"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Luan explained. Not all lightning within Azure Luans is True Thunder.  It requires constant refinement and transformation.  The lightning Qin Sang had received was undoubtedly True Thunder, but most Azure Luan cultivators only possess Demonic Thunder.  Their cultivation involves refining this Demonic Thunder into True Thunder.</p><p>Azure Void Lightning is the closest type to True Thunder. Refining it accelerates the refinement of Demonic Thunder and improves cultivation.  Only the Azure Void produces this lightning, and the Azure Luan had used this artifact to draw it out for Qin Sang to refine.</p><p>"Careful… will… explode! North… is… Blue Lotus Fruit…"</p><p>The Azure Luan warned that refining it carried risks, the worst being a backlash of energy. The remedy was a Blue Lotus Fruit, also found in the Azure Void.  It also passed a technique to Qin Sang to speed up the process.</p><p>However, these methods only mitigated the risks, not eliminate them.  The final outcome depended on Qin Sang.  No other Azure Luan had ever had this opportunity.</p><p>The Azure Void is a place where the Azure Luan reward their young talents.  It only opens when enough Azure Void Lightning has accumulated, allowing chosen Azure Luans to compete for it.  Now, Qin Sang had it all to himself.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't really need the Azure Void Lightning. He used his "Observing Thunder" technique to study the strand.</p><p>"It's quite similar to Azure Luan True Thunder…"</p><p>He nodded, deeply familiar with True Thunder.  He then tried to refine it using the Azure Luan's technique.</p><p>Suddenly, surprise flashed across his face. He opened his eyes, his palm raised, displaying blue-green electrical sparks.</p><p>As a human, Qin Sang cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* by visualizing Azure Luans, but he was never a true Azure Luan, neither in illusion nor reality.  In reality, he used Azure Luan True Thunder initially via the phoenix wings granted by the transformation and later through his Dharma form.  During the sixth transformation of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, he could have merged his essence into his Dharma form, perhaps becoming an Azure Luan, but he'd decided against it.</p><p>He always remained separated from the True Thunder.  But now, refining the Azure Void Lightning felt different. He didn't need his wings or Dharma form; he could refine it directly, as if he *was* an Azure Luan!</p><p>He sensed that the Azure Void Lightning wasn't naturally occurring; it contained a unique energy.  He told the Azure Luan.</p><p>"You… sensed… this, impressive! You… Azure Void Lightning… compatible, I… excited!"</p><p>The Azure Luan exclaimed. The lightning wasn't naturally created but artificially made by the Azure Luan. Perhaps, with it, Qin Sang could one day cultivate his own True Thunder!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if the change stemmed from his Dharma form or the unique energy.  He wanted to visit the Azure Void Lightning's origin to find out.</p><p>"Wait… until… strong enough. I need… to refine… divine ability…"</p><p>The Azure Luan told him it would be dormant for a while.  Qin Sang could cultivate peacefully; no other Azure Luan would disturb him until the secret realm opened.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Qin Sang spent ten years in the Azure Void.</p>
