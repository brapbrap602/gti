<h1>Chapter 798: The Jiao Clan</h1><p>The crystal exploded.</p><p>A feather popped out, trembled mid-air, then began to dissolve rapidly from the tip, as if weathered, ultimately vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>A whooshing sound echoed.</p><p>A streak of cyan light flew into the cave.</p><p>It was a demonic bird.</p><p>If any cultivator saw this scene, they would recognize it as a Green Dove, a venomous monster that demanded extreme caution.</p><p>This Green Dove was much smaller than its kin, but displayed remarkable intelligence. Its cultivation was far from the Transformation stage, clearly having been touched by the Emperor Flow Nectar.</p><p>Seeing the dissolving feather, panic filled the Green Dove's eyes. It shrieked, flapping its wings as it flew out, nearly colliding with the stone wall, its cries echoing, "Disaster… Disaster…"</p><p>The cave within the mountain was vast, connected to the depths of the earth.</p><p>The Green Dove flew straight down, non-stop, finally arriving before a stone gate surrounded by cyan light, panting heavily.</p><p>Before it could speak, a deep voice boomed from within the stone gate.</p><p>"What happened outside? Why such panic?"</p><p>The Green Dove spread its wings, prostrated itself on the ground, and trembled, "Reporting to Your Majesty, the Soul Feather left by the Saint… has shattered. He may have perished…"</p><p>The voice behind the stone gate remained calm, "Which Saint?"</p><p>The Green Dove propped itself up with its wings, pointing towards the cave above, "The Little Saint, appointed by Your Majesty, whom you helped transform and sent to the human sacred ground, Seven Kills Palace. Before departing, the Saint left a Soul Feather…"</p><p>An "Oh" sounded from behind the stone gate, followed by, "Him! I understand."</p><p>The tone remained indifferent, devoid of anger, and then fell silent.</p><p>The Green Dove was secretly surprised, somewhat taken aback.</p><p>After a while, the King behind the stone gate asked, "Anything else?"</p><p>The Green Dove quickly replied, "Your Majesty, your subordinate wonders if we should dispatch another Saint. Please give your command."</p><p>"No need."</p><p>The King stated decisively, "By sending one Saint, we have fulfilled our agreement with the Jiao Dragon Clan.  Encroaching on human sacred grounds, accidents are to be expected."</p><p>"Then…"</p><p>The Green Dove hesitated, "Should we inform the Jiao Clan of the Saint's death?"</p><p>The King fell silent for a moment.</p><p>"No! The Jiao King is arrogant and domineering. Upon learning of this, he will certainly force our clan to send another Saint.</p><p>"To successfully infiltrate the human Canglang Sea, the Saint must be below the Transformation stage to avoid detection by humans.  We used the ancient technique, Blood Burning Art, to help the Saint transform prematurely. After transformation, although demonic aura remains, human cultivators often have demonic aura themselves, as they use demonic beasts in their pill refinement. The difference between these two types of demonic aura is discernible only to us, allowing us to deceive them and infiltrate Desolate Island.</p><p>"This technique comes at a great cost. Not only does it require high talent from the Saint, but after transforming into human form, their cultivation cannot progress further, forever losing the opportunity to break through the Transformation stage, and their lifespan is greatly reduced.</p><p>"Furthermore, this technique requires me to personally cast it, each time leaving me severely weakened, requiring years of seclusion to recover.</p><p>"This useless technique, I don't know where the Jiao Clan obtained it.</p><p>"The Jiao Clan claims there's a treasure in the Seven Kills Palace, even opportunities for Deity Transformation, yet they refuse to reveal the source of this information, simply wanting to appoint us various clans to do their bidding! Not to mention the uncertainty of this matter's truth, even if it were true, the Seven Kills Palace has opened before. Numerous human experts wouldn't miss such an opportunity.</p><p>"I previously agreed to their demands out of necessity.  There's no need for further action.  Do not leak this matter.  Take another Sea Soul Crystal and Green Feather, and return them to the original location."</p><p>The Green Dove bowed its head submissively, its eyes wide with shock upon hearing the secrets of the technique. After receiving the King's command, it replied "Yes, Your Majesty," and flew back the way it came.</p><p>Silence returned to the cave.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang was completely oblivious to everything happening within the Canglang Sea.</p><p>He was fleeing for his life, occasionally glancing back, his heart pounding.</p><p>The Cold Flame had erupted at the heart of the storm, the surrounding hurricane affected by the power of the Winter Nether Cold Flame, causing chaos in the surrounding spiritual energy, forming a small vortex.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang reacted quickly enough, escaping successfully.</p><p>"If not for the Fire Pearl, I would have been in grave danger this time…"</p><p>A wry smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Although eager to learn the function of the bone flute, this was no place to linger.  He retrieved his jade talisman, determined his bearings, and flew towards the edge of the storm.</p><p>The chase had taken him far off course. After a difficult journey, he finally reached the storm's edge.</p><p>Cautiously, he observed the calm outside the storm before emerging.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang arrived near East Gate Island, shocked to find it in ruins and deserted.</p><p>The island's city was severely damaged, with parts of the island collapsed and submerged in the sea, clearly impacted by a terrifying force.</p><p>This gateway to the Seven Kills Palace was now rubble. He saw no corpses, suggesting the island's inhabitants had escaped beforehand.</p><p>"The Nascent Soul battle extended here!"</p><p>Qin Sang was alarmed, his vigilance heightened.  Seeing no unusual phenomena, he dared not stay, and after a moment of thought, flew northwest.</p><p>The closest large island was Thunderclap Island, with a cultivator's city, the central hub of the surrounding waters. He headed there, hoping to inquire about the aftermath of the Nascent Soul battle.</p><p>The journey was smooth.</p><p>With Thunderclap Island in sight and no apparent anomalies, Qin Sang descended onto the island and entered the city to seek information.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist asks about the Nascent Soul Grandmasters?"</p><p>The shopkeeper scrutinized Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist arrives late. The Nascent Soul battle has ended. It is said to have raged from the Seven Kills Palace all the way outside the storm, incredibly shocking and fierce, nearly destroying East Gate Island. Our Thunderclap Island was also in panic, at one point considering abandoning the island.  Later, for reasons unknown, the Nascent Soul cultivators of both sides suddenly ceased fighting and departed."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, suspecting the Demon Lord and Great Shaman had reached some agreement.</p><p>"Did those Nascent Soul Grandmasters leave any news before departing? Regarding the Seven Kills Palace…"</p><p>The shopkeeper pondered, "There seems to be a rumor that the next opening of the Seven Kills Palace will still be handled by the Witch Clan.  It's said it won't be long, but no specific time was given. However, this old man has always been on the island and cannot confirm the truth of this rumor…"</p><p>Qin Sang left a sum of spirit stones, and the shopkeeper, with a satisfied expression, personally escorted him out.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently using his true appearance.</p><p>The Stellar Chamber of Commerce also had a branch on Thunderclap Island, a thriving business, and one of the chamber's most valued locations. However, before eliminating Xiang Yi, Qin Sang would definitely avoid contact with the Stellar Chamber of Commerce to prevent exposing his identity.</p><p>"So, the Witch Clan hasn't achieved their goal. Next time, it might lead to even fiercer conflict, but that has nothing to do with me.  The more frequently the Seven Kills Palace opens, the greater my hope of finding the teleportation formation. I'll focus on my own affairs and head directly to Heaven's Prosperity Island…"</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision.</p>
