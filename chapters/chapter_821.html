<h1>Chapter 813: Island Master Luo</h1><p>Qin Sang lurked outside the mountain gate.</p><p>He waited for less than an hour before he saw fluctuations in the mountain protection formation of Vast Sea Sect, and his spirits were immediately lifted.</p><p>Several streaks of light flew out of the mountain gate and shot into the sky.</p><p>The leader’s aura was clearly far superior to the others’.</p><p>“Finally lured them out.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained where he was, waiting for a while to ensure no one else emerged from Vast Sea Sect before he set off.</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master and his disciples were flying towards the market.</p><p>With evidence of their crimes in hand, he was determined to give them a good beating this time.  It was a pity that Island Master Luo had previously decreed that they couldn't be completely eradicated.</p><p>This person and the power behind him were far beyond what the Vast Sea Sect Master could afford to offend.</p><p>Every time he recalled the destruction of Spirit Turtle Island two years ago, the Vast Sea Sect Master couldn't help but tremble with extreme fear. The force behind Island Master Luo was too mysterious and terrifying, capable of capturing and killing even Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master didn't have the slightest intention of defying Island Master Luo's words. He was even excited that he could have a connection with such a powerful force, perhaps even achieving great success because of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, after the death of the Spirit Turtle Island Master, Island Master Luo never contacted him again.</p><p>Lost in these thoughts, the Vast Sea Sect Master felt inexplicably uneasy. Finally sensing something was amiss, he abruptly stopped his flying light, turned around, and shouted, "Who's there!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, a thunderous beast roar suddenly erupted from the forest below.</p><p>A crackling sound followed, and a cyan storm emerged out of nowhere, destroying a large swathe of forest. It surged skyward with astonishing momentum, sweeping towards them.</p><p>"Dodge!"</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master saw the power of the storm, his face paling. He forcefully pushed away several disciples, then a blue light flew out from his dantian.</p><p>The blue light was a strangely shaped sword, seemingly refined from some kind of beast bone. It was his lifebound treasure, painstakingly refined over many years.</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master channeled his power into it, and the bone sword blazed with blue light. Its sword energy surged, blocking the storm.</p><p>But then he heard several screams. He abruptly turned his head and was horrified to discover that several of his disciples had been killed, the culprit being a crystal-clear flying sword.</p><p>"There's another one!"</p><p>By this point, how could the Vast Sea Sect Master not know that he had been tricked and fallen into a trap?</p><p>His first thought was to run.</p><p>But as he was about to escape with his sword, the flying sword pressed towards him like lightning, exploding with astonishing speed. Before his eyes, the sword blurred, splitting into four, making it difficult to distinguish the real one.</p><p>"Sword Light Splitting!"</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master cried out in terror.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Azure Flood Dragon appeared from the shadows.</p><p>In the realm of swordsmanship, the most difficult part was the breakthrough, but once that step was taken, progress would be rapid. He had grasped Sword Light Splitting, condensing sword light that was almost indistinguishable from the real thing, and was already capable of splitting it into three.</p><p>Given more time, once he mastered Sword Light Splitting, he could attempt to comprehend the realm of "One Sword Forms an Array." Generally, that was a realm only Nascent Soul ancestors could comprehend, extremely difficult to achieve.</p><p>Qin Sang could defeat the Vast Sea Sect Master with just the Ebony Sword, let alone with the Twin-Headed Azure Flood Dragon's assistance.</p><p>Man and beast attacked in turns.</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master struggled to cope, and within a few rounds, he was clearly losing.</p><p>To end the fight quickly, Qin Sang also used the Ten Yama Banners. Seizing the opportunity, he swept out with demonic fire, knocking away the Vast Sea Sect Master’s lifebound treasure and easily forcing him into a desperate situation.</p><p>He didn't even need to use the Star Conch or the Blood Defilement Divine Light.</p><p>“I’m doomed!”</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master was completely powerless, his face filled with despair. He didn’t even have time to ask his opponent’s identity or why he was being attacked.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire shattered the Vast Sea Sect Master's protective spiritual light, but didn't kill him directly.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to the Vast Sea Sect Master’s side, sealed his cultivation, glanced around, called back the Twin-Headed Azure Flood Dragon, and immediately fled.</p><p>From appearing to capturing the Vast Sea Sect Master, Qin Sang's actions were clean and efficient, leaving no trace. After leaving Barren Gate Island and ensuring there were no pursuers, Qin Sang found a deserted island and brought the man down.</p><p>After some interrogation.</p><p>Qin Sang finally learned the whole story.</p><p>The key figure was someone called Island Master Luo.</p><p>On the eve of Spirit Turtle Island's destruction, Island Master Luo had come to visit. Upon learning of Island Master Luo's cultivation and identity, the Vast Sea Sect Master immediately lost the will to resist and obediently followed orders.</p><p>Several other factions were also brought under Island Master Luo’s control.</p><p>They then learned that Island Master Luo had ordered them to assist in investigating the Spirit Turtle Island Master, to identify the cultivators who had listened to his sermons, and strictly forbade them from divulging any information, lest they face death.</p><p>The Spirit Turtle Island Master’s origins were mysterious and he was not someone to be trifled with, but after weighing their options, everyone decided to obey Island Master Luo's commands.</p><p>Island Master Luo turned out to be the island master of a large island near Qu Heng Island, and the person backing him was none other than one of the Qu Heng Island Masters.</p><p>As everyone knew, the Qu Heng Island Masters represented both the righteous and demonic factions. No matter how rampant the rogue cultivators of the Split Wind Islands were, they wouldn't dare attack Qu Heng Island.</p><p>Both of these forces were behemoths, overlords of the Canglang Sea!</p><p>No matter how strong the Spirit Turtle Island Master was, he was only one person. How could he compare to them?</p><p>The facts proved they had chosen correctly.</p><p>Island Master Luo infiltrated Barren Gate Island, subdued the Vast Sea Sect and other factions, and secretly investigated the Spirit Turtle Island Master, but showed no signs of taking action. Island Master Luo was hiding in the Vast Sea Sect at the time, so the Vast Sea Sect Master knew a bit more.</p><p>All the Golden Core cultivators connected to the Spirit Turtle Island Master were being hunted down.</p><p>It wasn’t until Spirit Turtle Island was destroyed that they realized Island Master Luo, a formidable late Golden Core cultivator, was merely a pawn sent to gather information. The ones who actually took action were Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>After besieging the Spirit Turtle Island Master, Island Master Luo gave them some rewards. They seemed to be solely targeting the Spirit Turtle Island Master, and after achieving their goal, they left.</p><p>The rewards from Island Master Luo actually helped the Vast Sea Sect Master break through the bottleneck that had plagued him for many years.</p><p>Having thought he'd never reach it, breaking through to mid-Golden Core reignited his confidence, and he一心wanted to curry favor with Island Master Luo, but the other party simply didn't look upon him favorably.</p><p>He still held a sliver of hope, instructing his disciples to keep an eye out. If they caught any escaped survivors, he would have a reason to pay a visit.</p><p>"The ones who attacked were from the righteous and demonic factions!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, not surprised. Only these two forces possessed such strength.</p><p>"But it's uncertain whether it was the righteous faction or the demonic faction."</p><p>"Did Senior Qing Zhu offend everyone, or just one of the sects?"</p><p>"I need to determine Island Master Luo's identity first. He should be an island master near Qu Heng Island, but I'm not sure which island. However, with such high cultivation, he wouldn't be unknown. I should be able to find out on Qu Heng Island."</p><p>Seeing that Senior Qing Zhu's enemies hadn't left any traps behind, and the Vast Sea Sect was currently vulnerable, Qin Sang was no longer worried. Before leaving, he returned to Barren Gate Island and plundered the Vast Sea Sect’s treasury, making a small fortune. He disguised it as the work of a passing rogue cultivator, motivated by greed, so it wouldn't be linked back to Senior Qing Zhu.</p><p>With the Vast Sea Sect weakened, Barren Gate Island would once again descend into chaos, but that no longer had anything to do with Qin Sang.</p>
