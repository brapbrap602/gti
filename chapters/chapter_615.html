<h1>Chapter 608: Broken Promise</h1><p>Chapter 608: Broken Promise</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand the inscription on the door, but through the spirit beast, she could vaguely sense the changes happening inside.</p><p>This spirit beast seemed to have been specifically refined to break the inscription on the Black Tower's door; it was a perfect match.  As soon as it entered the earthen wall, it caused violent fluctuations.</p><p>The spirit beast roared, disrupting the inscription.</p><p>Suddenly, countless black tendrils emerged from the earthen wall, like chains, entangling everything.</p><p>After the black tendrils appeared, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan attacked.  The King Kong Wheel and the Phoenix Sword severed the layers of black chains, gradually revealing a door hidden beneath the black energy.</p><p>Two Yuan Ying stage cultivators working together to break the inscription still found it incredibly difficult.</p><p>As the spirit beast's roars grew weaker, each severed tendril cost them immense effort.</p><p>Finally, the last black tendril shattered, and the door was fully revealed.</p><p>What lay beyond the door was again unexpected.</p><p>It wasn't the vast expanse like the seven levels below.</p><p>The ground was perfectly flat, paved with tiles. This seemed to be the true interior of the Black Tower.</p><p>A faint black mist filled the air, similar to the chains on the door. It not only obscured vision but also prevented spiritual sense from extending too far.</p><p>"Wait here."</p><p>Dongyang Bo left this single instruction before walking into the depths of the black mist with Chen Yan.</p><p>Qiumu Bai was in very poor condition, his potential depleted, his breath weak.  He was helped to sit down to recover. Qin Sang and the others were much better; they protected Qiumu Bai in their midst, not daring to wander.</p><p>The Black Tower was a dangerous place; the seven levels below were littered with bones. Who knew what dangers this level held? They were afraid of encountering something ominous.</p><p>The two walked deeper into the black mist,</p><p>a distance later, a bronze door blocked their path.</p><p>The ancient bronze door was tightly shut, ancient and imposing.</p><p>Dongyang Bo looked expectantly at Chen Yan and asked, "Miss Chen Yan, do you sense anything?"</p><p>His voice was low, afraid of interrupting Chen Yan's thoughts.</p><p>Chen Yan stared at the bronze door for a long time, then suddenly slashed her wrist with the Phoenix Sword, her blood splattering onto the bronze door.</p><p>The blood didn't slide down but writhed on the door as if coming alive, like bloodworms.</p><p>Chen Yan used a secret technique to force out more blood, forming a large blood array on the bronze door.</p><p>The blood array was seamless, shining with an eerie red light.</p><p>Then, a bloody aura surged from deep within the ancient door, merging with the blood array.</p><p>Seeing this, both Chen Yan and Dongyang Bo's eyes lit up.</p><p>"Master's methods are truly extraordinary!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo exclaimed in admiration, "Worthy of a great cultivator from a top-tier sect.  The bronze door, which no one in Xiaohan Region could open, was opened by him alone.  His preparations, effective even after two hundred years! I had my doubts…"</p><p>The bloody light grew brighter, dyeing the surrounding black mist blood-red.</p><p>When it reached its peak intensity, the bronze door shuddered violently and slowly opened.</p><p>'Creak…'</p><p>The massive door scraped against the ground, emitting an unpleasant sound.</p><p>The sound echoed through the entire space, clearly audible to Qin Sang and the others guarding the entrance.</p><p>Hearing this sound, Qin Sang felt a strange, fleeting unease.</p><p>It was probably the eerie atmosphere of this place, the unknown, making it difficult to feel at ease.</p><p>Looking at the others, they were all distracted, hoping to leave quickly.</p><p>Before the bronze door, the two observed for a moment, seeing no abnormalities beyond, then eagerly went inside.</p><p>Beyond the bronze door was a bronze hall, monolithic in its construction.</p><p>A layer of mottled green rust covered the hall; this hall had endured the ages, yet still succumbed to time.</p><p>The hall was empty, with a tall altar in the center.  On the altar was a protective dome, still glowing!</p><p>What was shocking was that the hall was covered in blood-red threads, like countless bloody webs covering the entire bronze hall.</p><p>Even the tall altar in the middle was no exception, the dome covered in the blood-red threads.</p><p>Upon entering the hall, Chen Yan's gaze was drawn to the altar and the dome, involuntarily walking towards it.</p><p>In the center of the altar was a large hole emitting black mist, bottomless.</p><p>The black mist, like demonic energy, seemed capable of consuming one's spirit; it was a demonic hole!</p><p>The dome perfectly covered the hole, firmly sealing the black mist inside.</p><p>Chen Yan looked down at the demonic hole, her expression complex, a mixture of excitement and worry.</p><p>She gently raised her right hand, and the blood-red threads in the bronze hall seemed to respond to something, retreating and gathering towards Chen Yan's palm.</p><p>The threads gathered into a drop of blood on her hand.</p><p>More and more threads gathered, the drop of blood becoming more crystal clear, forming a blood-red pearl!</p><p>Finally, all the threads disappeared, merging into the blood pearl.</p><p>Chen Yan held the blood pearl, about to throw it at the dome.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Dongyang Bo, who had been silently observing, suddenly stepped forward to block Chen Yan.  He pointed at the blood bead, saying to the furious Chen Yan, "Miss Chen Yan, before saving your master, lend me this for a moment to retrieve something."</p><p>"Dongyang Bo, you're breaking your promise!"</p><p>Chen Yan was furious. Dongyang Bo had secretly harbored ulterior motives, biding his time until this crucial moment to strike.</p><p>Dongyang Bo shook his head. "I'm not breaking my promise, merely altering the process. Help me obtain the treasure first, then we save your master. While it will consume some of the blood bead's power, I guarantee that once we have that item, saving your master will be effortless!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo sighed. "You were sent away by your master in time, so you didn't witness the horrors of the Demon Cave. Even if your master is alive, things are likely dire. What happens after the protective barrier is opened is beyond our control. It's better to be safe than sorry. I don't want to be forced out of the Demon Cave empty-handed..."</p><p>"You despicable villain! You think I'd still trust you?"</p><p>Chen Yan's rage blazed.  She gritted her teeth, sword pointed at Dongyang Bo. "You want the blood bead? Only over my dead body!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo seemed to shake his head in resignation. "I know you possess a defensive treasure left by your master. Though you only recently broke through to the Yuan Ying stage, your strength is exceptional.  And I'm bound by a blood pact your master left, preventing me from taking your life. However..."</p><p>Dongyang Bo paused, a smirk playing on his lips. He suddenly reached towards the outside of the bronze hall, and the King Kong Zhuo flew out with a whoosh.</p><p>Seeing this inexplicable action, an ominous feeling washed over Chen Yan.</p><p>Outside the bronze hall, Qin Sang was meditating when the King Kong Zhuo enveloped him. He felt a sudden tightening, then an overwhelming force immobilized him, leaving him utterly helpless as he was dragged into the darkness.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>Without warning.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and the others watched in horror as Qin Sang disappeared into the dark energy.</p><p>They had just stood up when they heard Dongyang Bo's voice transmission ordering them to stay put.</p><p>They exchanged glances, filled with suspicion and uncertainty about what had just transpired.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, was the most bewildered and terrified. He recognized the King Kong Zhuo, Dongyang Bo's life-bound treasure, that had captured him.</p><p>What exactly was happening? Why had his own ancestral master attacked him?</p>
