<h1>Chapter 2131: Enlightenment Again</h1><p>The tutor retrieved the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram, leaving King Lu and his followers completely exposed.</p><p>Thunder crashed down from above.</p><p>The breath of death enveloped everyone, bringing profound fear.  Faced with such terrifying power, no one could even contemplate resistance.</p><p>They could only watch helplessly as the Grand Minister perished.</p><p>A late-stage expert, capable of employing spatial techniques, met such an end, utterly powerless.  What hope did they have?</p><p>The remaining followers scattered.</p><p>Those who had been invited to assist, such as Shi Mu, would certainly not willingly sacrifice themselves for King Lu.  Without hesitation, they fled in all directions. The idea of standing together and fighting alongside King Lu never even crossed their minds.</p><p>It's a case of "let my friend die, but not me." King Lu was the mastermind, and logically, the enemy would choose to kill him first, giving the others a chance to survive.</p><p>King Lu had rarely had the opportunity to assert his authority since inheriting the throne. Now, with the Grand Minister dead, King Lu alone could not intimidate these people.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The blue lightning surged, splitting into two streams in the air. One stream directly targeted Lu Gan.</p><p>A clearly visible, intensely blue streak, like a turquoise river spanning the sky, descended from the heavens.</p><p>Lu Gan was frantically fleeing on the ground.</p><p>The earth's spiritual energy and life force had been drained by the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram, obliterating vegetation and transforming mountains into barren hills, leaving no place to hide.</p><p>Lu Gan looked up, sensing he was locked onto by the blue lightning.  His expression was utterly ferocious, like a dying beast cornered.</p><p>When the Lightning Oath Scroll and the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram collided, he had been directly struck, suffering severe injuries. The ensuing pursuit left him unable to fight back; he could only await his death.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A beam of lightning, containing hundreds of bolts, struck where Lu Gan stood.</p><p>At the last moment, Lu Gan's figure suddenly shimmered. The lightning struck the earth, obliterating an entire mountain range and leaving behind a deep crater with lingering lightning energy. Lu Gan had disappeared. In the distance, one of his companion beasts was frantically transforming into his likeness.</p><p>As soon as Lu Gan appeared, his eyes bulged, revealing a look of terror.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Lightning exploded within him.  A faint flash of something like a sword-like lightning bolt was barely visible.</p><p>Lu Gan's body stiffened, shattered, and his life force vanished!</p><p>Another of King Lu's generals fell, a massive blow to morale, causing even King Lu's remaining troops to flee for their lives.</p><p>Meanwhile, King Lu was being pursued by another stream of blue lightning.</p><p>Eliminating Lu Gan was merely incidental.  Qin Sang channeled the remaining power of the Lightning Oath Scroll, the power of the lightning like an abyss, firmly locking onto King Lu.</p><p>At that moment, King Lu could only summon his four companion beasts, sending them fleeing in four directions.</p><p>Black smoke billowed from his head, from which a six-sided black umbrella rose, spinning and rapidly expanding into a giant umbrella, large enough to cover hundreds of miles.</p><p>The umbrella became a barrier, shielding King Lu from the lightning. But then thunder roared, the umbrella shook violently, its surface torn by the lightning, collapsing into a puff of black smoke. The umbrella was reduced to its original form, its spiritual light scattering as it tumbled from the sky.</p><p>Below the umbrella, King Lu held a palm-sized round mirror, aiming it at himself.  Ripples spread across the mirror's surface, and spiritual light, like water, surrounded him.</p><p>Instantly, ripples spread through the void, and King Lu's figure vanished.</p><p>King Lu's aura completely disappeared. He couldn't hide his trail from the Tian Mu Butterfly, so he must have used a shifting technique to escape. However, his four companion beasts showed no sign of change, making it impossible to determine which beast he had transferred into.</p><p>Unfortunately, King Lu's plan was useless against Qin Sang.</p><p>The four companion beasts were running across the ground when they discovered that the ground had vanished. The sky and the blue lightning also disappeared, leaving them in a vast night sky.</p><p>The Four-Symbol Sword Formation!</p><p>Though the Void-Breaking Spirit Pagoda had been used, King Lu hadn't left his beasts outside beforehand. Qin Sang wouldn't give him a chance to escape.</p><p>Starlight turned to killing intent.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Myriad bolts of blue lightning descended into the sword formation.</p><p>No matter which beast King Lu had possessed, escape was impossible.</p><p>This battle held the attention of Shi Mu and the others.</p><p>They watched as the lightning briefly vanished, the world plunged into darkness. Then, stars appeared in the sky, enveloped in lightning, emitting terrifying fluctuations.</p><p>A terrifying power erupted in the starlit sky, but the King Lu was nowhere to be seen from beginning to end.</p><p>The outcome was clear: a generation of kings had fallen, leaving everyone without a shred of hope!</p><p>“The Lu family is finished!”</p><p>The Shao Shi sensed the dissipation of King Lu's aura, sighed silently, and fled Westland without looking back.</p><p>With one Emperor and four Kings among the Siyou, the successive misfortunes of two major clans meant Si Lu would soon return in force. The rapidly changing situation was dizzying, demanding an immediate report to the Si Emperor.</p><p>How to deal with the Si family of Yan Mountain and this Qin Zhenren also required careful consideration.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted from the sword formation to the fleeing Mu and others, saying coldly, “Surrender, and I may spare your lives. Otherwise, you may try your luck escaping my grasp!”</p><p>At these words, everyone's hearts tightened.</p><p>Qin Sang's power far exceeded their imagination. Even the Grand Protector and King Lu had fallen; the Siyou clan's life-saving techniques were useless against him. Could they truly escape with their lives?</p><p>Yet, reason and past experience told them that life was always earned, never granted.</p><p>Surrender meant certain death!</p><p>At that moment, a frost marten leaped out from somewhere, and Si Lu shouted, "Heaven has compassion. Considering your cultivation hardships, and that you are not the main culprits in the upheaval against my Si family of Yan Mountain, I offer you the position of Yan Mountain guest disciples. Let bygones be bygones.”</p><p>Coming from the heir of the Yan King, the next Yan King, these words carried immense weight. Si Lu's offer was like a lifeline, resolving the hesitation in many hearts.</p><p>Especially for Mu and others, they had no blood feud with the Si family of Yan Mountain. Serving them was far better than death. After all, the Si family of Yan Mountain was one of the four major clans. Subjugation to the Yan King, at least, preserved their dignity.</p><p>Si Lu only offered the position of guest disciples, not even guest elders, but circumstances dictated their options. Defeated soldiers had no right to make demands.</p><p>They didn't want to experience the power of the Oath of Thunder firsthand.</p><p>Soon, some abandoned their escape, deactivated their flying talismans, and stood waiting for their fate.</p><p>Mu and Ying stopped as well.</p><p>Si Lu remembered the power of these two vividly, secretly delighted by their submission.</p><p>Only two of King Lu's staunch loyalists remained defiant. Having participated in the massacre during the attack on the Si family of Yan Mountain, they knew there would be no mercy.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang showed no mercy, swiftly eliminating them one by one.</p><p>Thus, King Lu's forces were vanquished—dead, fled, or surrendered. The Storm Realm had won a resounding victory!</p><p>On the battlefield, the thunder's power still lingered, a testament to the battle's intensity.</p><p>Qin Sang stood suspended in mid-air, thunder at his feet. After killing the last man, his gaze shifted to a mountain peak.</p><p>Yuan Miao stood there, staring at Qin Sang in stunned disbelief.</p><p>He hadn't been affected, and Qin Sang hadn't attacked him, leaving him unharmed.</p><p>Yuan Miao knew of Qin Sang's interaction with the Yuanxiang clan leader and believed that he had a reason for accepting this battle. However, he thought Qin Sang could at best put up a fight and buy them three years.</p><p>But at the reveal of his true strength, the surprise was breathtaking!</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded at Yuan Miao, a silent greeting, then closed his eyes and entered a meditative state.</p><p>“Grand Master!”</p><p>“Saint Qin!”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to hear calls from thousands of miles away, witnessing the Storm Realm cultivators prostrating themselves before him, their reverence fervent and fervent.</p><p>These scenes were ethereal yet so real.</p><p>This was genuine worship. The statue from before was just an inanimate object, mostly symbolic. Now, in their hearts, the living Qin Sang had become the true Saint Qin.</p><p>He was the protector and master of the Storm Realm; all things, all beings in the Storm Realm depended on him.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang truly felt this was his dojo!</p><p>The chapters of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* flowed into his mind, guided by the fervent calls, the devout hearts, and the experiences of defeating his enemies, clearing the path to enlightenment. He navigated through the obscure scriptures, dispelling the mists obscuring the path to the Dao.</p><p>A pleased smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>All his preparation, his careful planning, his painstaking efforts had paid off!</p><p>This was the Great Slaughter Dao!</p><p>He was uncertain if this battle would propel him to the late Nascent Soul stage, but the path ahead would undoubtedly be smoother.</p><p>In fact, the Storm Realm was too small, too weak to serve as the dojo for a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator. For most cultivators pursuing the Great Dao, their dojo was the foundation of their Dao, its strength directly impacting their cultivation.</p><p>Normally, even with the hearts of the Storm Realm people won over, Qin Sang wouldn't benefit much from the current situation.  However, the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture* cultivates a supreme killing path, emphasizing the single word 'kill'. This time, the enemy not only boasts numerous experts but also a top-tier strongman ranking among the best even in the late Nascent Soul stage.  On our side, there are only four Nascent Soul cultivators, the strongest being only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  Anyone else would have fled in terror.</p><p>This battle resulted in a glorious victory, and such remarkable gains are hardly surprising.</p><p>Next, with both internal and external troubles quelled, the situation is excellent.  He can slowly develop his own Daoist grounds. More importantly, he can focus on improving his cultivation!  Before encountering his next bottleneck, he is sure to experience a period of rapid advancement.</p><p>However, amidst his joy, Qin Sang couldn't help but think: while still in the mid-Nascent Soul stage, he had to kill the Grand Protector, a top-tier expert, to achieve enlightenment, almost annihilating the Lu family, one of the four major clans of the Siyou tribe.</p><p>Once he enters the late Nascent Soul stage and continues down the path of supreme killing, what will he have to do to seek a breakthrough to the Unity stage?  Could it be that he'll have to confront a Unity stage force, defeat them head-on, and even annihilate them?</p><p>Qin Sang hasn't been blinded by joy. Even if he were arrogant, he wouldn't think he'd have the ability to transcend realms and challenge a Unity stage powerhouse at that point.</p><p>He can only take things one step at a time, hoping that he's overthinking.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Storm Realm, in the deep ocean, on a spirit island near the fog tide, the peak of a mountain has been leveled.</p><p>The mountain is lush and vibrant, yet seems devoid of life, unusually quiet.</p><p>On a stone platform at the summit, a goban is carved.  Three figures are present: two playing, and one observing.</p><p>These are the same three individuals who played go in the Zhuyan territory, though the brothers have switched places, with one brother now playing against the man in white robes.</p><p>The goban surface is filled with spiritual light. They are playing Dao Seeking Go; the board and pieces are aligned with the Dao. Playing a game is like embarking on a Dao Seeking journey; weaker players often benefit more.  If it's fellow disciples from the same lineage playing, the stronger one can also use this opportunity to enlighten the weaker one.</p><p>Their game against the white-robed man is essentially a Dao Seeking session.  Since their opponent rarely has free time, the brothers eagerly wish to play until the end of time.</p><p>The Lu King's army arrived in the West Lands, and they followed, setting up the goban here, engaging in Dao Seeking while also watching the spectacle, occasionally commenting on the performance of both sides.</p><p>The young man playing, after much thought, carefully places a piece, as if making an important decision.  He lets out a sigh of relief, looks at the white-robed man.</p><p>The white-robed man nods gently, showing approval, but doesn't rush to make his move.  He turns his gaze towards the horizon.</p><p>Moments later, the brothers also sense something.</p><p>The player says, "I didn't expect those foreign tribes to hold out this long. This time, the Grand Protector should show his true abilities, or it will take too long."</p><p>"That altar formation is indeed not simple, but the Grand Protector and the Young Master probably fear the Yuanxiang Clan Chief and are still probing. They still don't understand the Zhuyan tribe; those savage fellows are reckless, but their word is always their bond.  If they say they won't interfere, they certainly won't."</p><p>After assessing the three forces, the observer concludes, "As long as the Grand Protector and Young Master personally take action, unless the people behind those foreign tribes intervene, defeat is inevitable!"</p><p>As if in response to his words, thunder suddenly appears, with lightning dancing wildly in the sky.</p><p>The brothers' expressions change instantly.  The observer abruptly rises, staring intently at the Storm Realm, his face filled with shock.</p><p>Divine thunder stirs heaven and earth.</p><p>With their cultivation, they can sense the terrifying pressure contained within the thunder; even from such a distance, it makes their scalps tingle.</p><p>"This… what is this?"</p><p>The brothers can't hide their shock.</p><p>The white-robed man remains impassive, slowly rising and coldly snorting, "Quite a Qin Zhenren!"</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>He throws his go piece onto the board. The goban trembles, the spiritual light dissipates, transforming into an ordinary stone table and stones.</p><p>The white-robed man sweeps his wide sleeves and departs on the wind.</p><p>The brothers exchange a look, erase their traces on the mountain, and hastily follow.</p><p>…</p><p>Another sea area.</p><p>On a certain island.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan Chief lies on his back among the treetops, looking tipsy.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>He suddenly sobers up, his eyes flashing with brilliance. He sits up, gazes for a long time, a look of surprise crossing his eyes.</p><p>Finally, he clicks his tongue twice, takes another gulp of wine, and comfortably lies back down.</p><p>It seems this Qin Zhenren knows his limits; that thunderous might didn't strike Shengmu Plain again, otherwise, it would certainly cause a massacre, and the Changyou tribe's Sacred Lake formation probably couldn't withstand it.</p><p>…</p><p>No one noticed.</p><p>At this time, unusual fluctuations emanated from the Foul Lands, but were covered by the clamor of the sacrificial thunder oath.</p>
