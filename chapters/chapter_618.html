<h1>Chapter 611: Unyielding Spirit!</h1><p>"If you're concerned about chastity or morality, don't be. Those are merely mortal constructs, designed to maintain order in the mundane world. For Nascent Soul cultivators like us, those below Nascent Soul are no different from ants. We’re considered benevolent if we don't slaughter entire cities or nations. If you can't even see through this, your cultivation has been in vain.”</p><p>Duke Dongyang used both threats and inducements, his methods well-practiced, certain that Chen Yan's desire to save her master would force her to compromise.</p><p>At this moment, Chen Yan suddenly met Qin Sang's gaze. Like a lightning bolt, it pierced her heart, and she froze.</p><p>What kind of look was that?</p><p>It seemed to question her.</p><p>When threatened and cornered, do you resign yourself to fate and compromise, or seize even the slightest chance to resist and never surrender?</p><p>In the next instant, a bloody sword light erupted from the bronze hall, brighter than the blood pearl in Chen Yan’s hand, dazzlingly red, yet tinged with a tragic, desolate beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang, who should have been completely crippled by the sealing talisman,</p><p>suddenly had a small flying sword emerge from his Baihui acupoint, shooting straight towards the Vajra Ring.</p><p>The Vajra Ring was Duke Dongyang's natal magic treasure, constantly by his side, refined day and night. Among top-grade magic treasures, it was exceptional.</p><p>Compared to the Vajra Ring, this small sword seemed weak and insignificant.</p><p>But the bloody light radiating from the flying sword made even Duke Dongyang's face change!</p><p>“Blood Defilement Divine Light!”</p><p>To prevent Chen Yan from rescuing Qin Sang, Duke Dongyang had used the Vajra Ring to imprison him, leaving almost no space between them. Qin Sang's sudden attack was so unexpected that even the powerful Duke Dongyang couldn't recall his treasure in time.</p><p>The Blood Defilement Divine Light could only be used once in the Violet Palace.</p><p>During Sin Abyss’s attack, Leng Yuntian's magic treasure was severely damaged, allowing Qin Sang to save this Blood Defilement Divine Light. In subsequent battles, he faced either powerful demons or lone ghosts.</p><p>The Blood Defilement Divine Light had remained unused until now, becoming Qin Sang’s lifeline.</p><p>Duke Dongyang's sealing talisman was potent, completely immobilizing Qin Sang’s physical body. He had secretly tried countless times to break free, but couldn't shake the talisman's power.</p><p>However, his Nascent Soul was protected by the Jade Buddha, rendering the talisman ineffective against it. He could still use the Ebony Sword!</p><p>His meridians, Qi Sea, and even his pseudo-core were sealed, his spiritual power locked away, but the killing inscription on the Ebony Sword acted as a unique kind of dantian, absorbing spiritual energy from the world and powering the sword.</p><p>Moreover, his divine sense remained unrestricted.</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>His initial plan was to wait for the fight between Duke Dongyang and Chen Yan, then escape in the chaos.</p><p>But when Duke Dongyang revealed the *Stone Bridge Zen*, Qin Sang knew he couldn't wait any longer.</p><p>Duke Dongyang saw him as an ant. Chen Yan was his only hope. If she accepted the *Stone Bridge Zen* and agreed to the deal, he would never escape.</p><p>He couldn’t give Chen Yan time to consider. He had to gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang's final glance at Chen Yan was a question: what choice would she make?</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Vajra Ring was engulfed in bloody light.</p><p>The Ebony Sword's Blood Defilement Divine Light wasn't strong enough to destroy the Vajra Ring, but its defiling power temporarily disrupted Duke Dongyang's control.</p><p>Touched by the Blood Defilement Divine Light, the Vajra Ring’s glow dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the power binding him finally dissipate. His gaze met Chen Yan's, then he rose on his sword, fleeing the bronze hall without looking back.</p><p>Shaken by Qin Sang's gaze, Chen Yan finally reacted.</p><p>She hadn't expected him to escape Duke Dongyang's control on his own, but that didn't mean he was safe. His fate now depended on her choice.</p><p>What should she do?</p><p>She had little time to think, but she didn't hesitate. She raised her phoenix-shaped sword and lunged at Duke Dongyang.</p><p>A fierce battle erupted within the ancient bronze hall!</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, sensing the change behind him, felt a wave of relief. Chen Yan hadn’t disappointed him.</p><p>At the same time, a map appeared in his mind - directions from Chen Yan on how to escape through the secret passage.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fist. Escaping had been his biggest worry, and Chen Yan had solved it.</p><p>Though he knew Chen Yan's actions also protected her from further threats by Duke Dongyang, Qin Sang silently thanked her.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Using the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique, Qin Sang flew towards the exit at full speed.</p><p>He was incredibly fast, endless darkness retreating behind him.  Just as the exit came into view, Duke Dongyang's furious roar echoed from the bronze hall, "Kill him! Tear him to pieces!"</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang saw Mu Yifeng and the others.</p><p>Mu Yifeng, Ji Qing, and Yu Wansen stood there, staring in surprise. Only Qiu Mubai, still weakened, remained slumped.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank.  Even in the midst of battle, Duke Dongyang hadn't forgotten him, ordering his disciples to kill him!</p><p>Caught between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth and pressed on.</p><p>The four of them exchanged glances, hearing Duke Dongyang’s command.</p><p>The first to attack was Mu Yifeng!</p><p>At Duke Dongyang's order, Mu Yifeng, without hesitation, summoned the Nine Fire Divine Edge.  Pointing it at Qin Sang, he charged.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill.</p><p>On Shaohua Mountain, Mu Yifeng had been one of his closest fellow disciples. He had even saved Mu Yifeng’s life.</p><p>Yet, Mu Yifeng attacked without hesitation.</p><p>For a moment, their gazes locked. Seeing the look in Mu Yifeng's eyes, Qin Sang paused.</p><p>The next instant, the Ebony Sword clashed with the Nine Fire Divine Edge, shattering the latter into pieces!</p><p>“My treasure!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng cried out in apparent horror, his primary weapon destroyed, leaving him vulnerable.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Mu Yifeng's Nine Fire Divine Edge, refined for a century, was far superior to other magical weapons.  Even the Ebony Sword couldn't have shattered it so easily.</p><p>Mu Yifeng must have secretly destroyed his most prized possession, feigning defeat.</p><p>This weapon, which Mu Yifeng valued more than his own life, intended to become his natal magic treasure after forming his Gold Core, was destroyed by his own hand.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze.</p><p>Only their eyes could communicate. Mu Yifeng’s gaze seemed to urge him on, a farewell, and a blessing.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was about to pierce Mu Yifeng's chest. Qin Sang gritted his teeth, but didn't hold back.  He knew the more ruthless he appeared, the better Mu Yifeng’s chance of survival.</p><p>He couldn’t betray Mu Yifeng’s sacrifice.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The Ebony Sword pierced Mu Yifeng’s left chest, injuring his heart, but at the last moment, Qin Sang subtly shifted the sword’s trajectory, avoiding a fatal blow.</p><p>Mu Yifeng was flung away like a rag doll, colliding with Ji Qing.</p><p>Ji Qing and Yu Wansen were startled.  Mu Yifeng wasn't even a match for Qin Sang. Uncertainty filled them.  Ji Qing caught Mu Yifeng, finding him still alive, and quickly gave him a medicinal pill.</p><p>Yu Wansen hesitated. By the time he attacked Qin Sang, it was too late.</p><p>The Ebony Sword easily deflected Yu Wansen's weapon, and Qin Sang, like an arrow loosed from its bow, shot through the exit, vanishing from their sight. By the time Yu Wansen and Ji Qing gave chase, even his sword light was gone.</p><p>The Black Tower was vast.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t dare stop, traversing layer after layer until he finally emerged.</p><p>He could only trust Chen Yan, following her directions, escaping through the ancient halls and walls, unlocking seals, entering the secret passage, passing through the Path of Hungry Ghosts, and arriving beneath the small lake.</p><p>As she had said, the barrier only allowed exit. Qin Sang leaped upwards, breaking through and surfacing in the lake.</p><p>He swam upwards, flew out of the lake, and sped towards the foot of the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>There were no pursuers. Chen Yan was holding Duke Dongyang back.</p><p>Finally escaping the Heavenly Mountain, Qin Sang paused, glancing back, suddenly lost.</p><p>The world was vast, and he didn't know where to go.</p><p>He had spent nearly a century on Shaohua Mountain, developing attachments, but returning was impossible.</p><p>Even the Xiaohan Region was no longer safe.</p><p>Chen Yan could hold Duke Dongyang back, but he doubted she could kill him. She had only recently reached Nascent Soul. If one of them were to fall, it would likely be Chen Yan.</p><p>The most probable outcome was a truce.</p><p>Soon, both Chen Yan and Duke Dongyang would be searching for him. If Chen Yan decided to cultivate the *Stone Bridge Zen*, it would be even more dangerous.</p><p>He had nowhere to hide.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang continued to fly.</p><p>Arriving at Sword Scar Mountain, he glanced upwards.</p><p>If only Cloud Wanderer had finished his closed-door cultivation. He could seek his advice.  But the mountain was peaceful, no sign of Cloud Wanderer. He must still be healing.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t wait.</p><p>He flew past Sword Scar Mountain, not daring to leave a mark for Cloud Wanderer, fearing it would endanger him.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang landed before the stone cliff, opening the hidden door and entering the ancient Sword Path Hall. The ancient teleportation formation inside was his only hope of escape.</p><p>Years ago, Qingzhu, pursued by a Nascent Soul cultivator, was forced to flee.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang found himself repeating Qingzhu’s story.</p><p>He stood before the ancient formation, his expression shifting.</p><p>Staying meant certain death.</p><p>The other side might be more dangerous, but it offered a chance of survival.</p><p>The choice was clear.</p><p>Taking out eight mid-grade spirit stones, he placed them in the eight corners of the formation.  As the formation glowed brightly, Qin Sang turned towards the Xiaohan Region beyond the Violet Palace.</p><p>His expression changed, his gaze deep.</p><p>He had lived for over a century, all of it in the Xiaohan Region.</p><p>Now he realized he was but a sojourner, looking back on a hundred years.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A sharp sound interrupted his thoughts.  Turning back, he saw one of the spirit stones in the formation cracked, its power almost depleted. The formation glowed brightly, but hadn’t activated, as if something was missing.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face paled, despair rising. Had Qingzhu destroyed the formation on the other side?</p><p>Suddenly, he remembered something, hastily retrieving a high-grade spirit stone from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Unlocking its seal, without pausing to appreciate its pure spiritual energy, he replaced the cracked stone.  The formation changed.</p><p>Then, another mid-grade spirit stone cracked, and the formation stalled again.</p><p>Qin Sang winced, feeling the pain of loss, and placed another high-grade spirit stone, praying that no more would be needed. He only had four.</p><p>He was also astonished. The Shangyuan Clear Serenity Palace’s formation could transport many people with only eight mid-grade spirit stones.</p><p>This formation, meant for one or two people, required high-grade spirit stones, and more than one.</p><p>Where would it lead?</p><p>“Hummm…”</p><p>The altar vibrated, the formation’s light filling the hall like daylight. A powerful surge of spiritual energy erupted from its center.</p><p>The formation activated!</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the platform.  Darkness enveloped him, followed by immense pressure from all sides.</p><p>He was shocked, using his only available defense, his divine sense, to resist.  Soon, it was depleted, and a searing pain overwhelmed him. He lost consciousness.</p><p>(Volume 1: The Mortal World - End)</p><p>(Volume 2: To the Ends of the Earth - Coming Soon)</p><p>(I haven't rested since I started writing this book.
