<h1>Chapter 1584: The Search</h1><p>Chapter 1584: The Search</p><p>Overhearing nearby cultivators, I learned this was Su Zinan's third search area.  The previous two had yielded nothing.  Cultivators gathered on nearby islands, watching the results.  No one knew what methods Su Zinan was employing.</p><p>The distant sea swelled dramatically, water pouring outwards.  Rising slightly, I saw the swell was ring-shaped, creating a bottomless pit in the center.  Varied colored lights flashed incessantly within the pit, and I could clearly sense the fluctuations of magical artifacts and spells.  Several figures floated inside.  A few were clearly central figures.</p><p>I focused my gaze, recognizing them. One, in white robes and jade belt, was the currently prominent Su Zinan. His appearance suited the Moon Empress quite well.</p><p>"That old demon wasn't Su Zinan after all," I thought, recalling Old Wu.  I remembered the old demon lacked the Moon Seal on his forehead, so he wasn't a Moon Guard.  His position in Luye remained a mystery.</p><p>Scanning the others, I noticed the man beside Su Zinan. Silent and still, he exuded an otherworldly aura.</p><p>"Mo Xingdao, the North Waste's foremost independent cultivator. What's his connection to Luye?  A Nascent Soul sect indeed! At least three major cultivators, openly and secretly! Did the old demon not come? Or is he hidden, waiting to support Su Zinan?"</p><p>I observed Mo Xingdao for a while, then activated my Sky-Eyed Butterfly to search secretly, from Su Zinan to the outer onlookers.  I scanned the area but didn't find anyone resembling Old Wu.</p><p>As the sun set, the lights in the pit suddenly extinguished. Su Zinan flew out, his face grim, followed by Mo Xingdao and the others. The sea calmed, returning to normal.  Then, ignoring everyone, Su Zinan flew back to the Chi Nan island chain.  Unsurprisingly, this search had failed.</p><p>…</p><p>Over the following month, I followed Su Zinan to many places, each trip ending in disappointment.  His movements were erratic, heading in all directions. I started to suspect whether Su Zinan could actually locate the Wuwang Hall ruins, or if he was deliberately delaying.</p><p>Lately, the onlookers included many more cultivators of unknown origins, some concealing their auras, but not from my spiritual senses.  My cultivation of the Fire Seed Lotus wasn't hampered, so I decided to continue waiting on Su Zinan.</p><p>Another half-month passed.  While cultivating, the innkeeper sent word that Su Zinan had left the island again.  His departures were always highly visible, saving me the trouble of constant surveillance.</p><p>I slowly ended my cultivation, the fire lotus seed receding into my brow.  Without needing to ask his destination, upon leaving the inn, I saw numerous escape lights soaring in unison towards the same direction.  I calmly followed.</p><p>I quickly noticed this was different.  Su Zinan was heading southeast at full speed, his destination clear.  A thought occurred to me, and I accelerated, surpassing most cultivators.</p><p>Shortly after, we reached a new sea area.  I landed on a deserted island, selecting a vantage point.  From afar, I saw Su Zinan and his group on the sea's surface, gathered in a circle, seemingly in discussion.</p><p>After an incense stick's time, Mo Xingdao and other Nascent Soul cultivators each received a strangely shaped wooden stake from Su Zinan, then dispersed. Only a Moon Guard remained by Su Zinan's side.</p><p>The stakes were as thick as a thigh, only three feet long, their surfaces etched with dense grooves.  Under sunlight, they reflected an eerie blood-red glow, like blood flowing through their veins.  Everyone holding a stake formed a ten-li radius circle, Su Zinan at the center, levitating and meditating.</p><p>Su Zinan closed his eyes. The others began to work busily.  From the distance, I couldn't see what they were doing, though it seemed to be an array formation.</p><p>Soon, Su Zinan let out an unintelligible growl. Mo Xingdao and the others immediately threw their stakes into the sea.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Water splashed. The stakes sank, mostly submerged, a portion remaining above the surface, suspended.  At the same time, Su Zinan raised his hands, quickly forming a hand seal, then pressed downwards. A ray of light shot into the sea, silently merging with the water.</p><p>Suddenly, the outer stakes changed.  The blood in the grooves flowed rapidly, emitting intense blood-red light. The stakes reacted to each other, their lights intermingling.</p><p>*Swish swish swish…*</p><p>The blood-light formed lines, connecting all stakes, creating a complex pattern on the sea's surface.</p><p>Su Zinan, the one controlling the array, seemed to be straining greatly. His face was flushed, and his upper body swayed.</p><p>Just as onlookers thought something had gone wrong, Su Zinan suddenly faded and disappeared.  Simultaneously, a Su Zinan appeared above each wooden stake, instantly merging with it.</p><p>"Open!"</p><p>With a loud shout, the stakes plunged into the seabed. The water at the center of the array turned completely to blood, a shocking crimson, like a blood-red jewel embedded in the ocean.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The blood churned, forming a thick beam of blood-red light that shot skyward.</p><p>Both Su Zinan's actions and this Bloodwood Array differed drastically from previous attempts. Anyone with discerning eyes could see that today held a significant change.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the beam of light, only to witness an astonishing sight.</p><p>The blood-red light reached a thousand meters high, then abruptly vanished. The Bloodwood Array continued to operate, the column of light still flowing, but only the lower section was visible.  It seemed an invisible, enormous maw in the void was swallowing the light.</p><p>Gasps of astonishment erupted around them.</p><p>Qin Sang focused intently on where the light disappeared, urging the Sky Eye Butterfly to utilize its Sky Eye ability to the fullest.  Initially, he saw nothing; no invisible barrier as he'd imagined.</p><p>As the blood light intensified, it finally changed. A dark spot faintly appeared within, then expanded at an alarming rate.</p><p>In a flash, the dark spot grew to half the size of the light column and continued to spread rapidly.</p><p>Even those without the Sky Eye Butterfly noticed the anomaly in the blood light. A mysterious force was tearing a hole in the void, resembling some kind of passage.</p><p>"We found it!"</p><p>"Are you sure it's the Wuwang Palace?  Was it like this the last time the ruins opened?  Anyone here?"</p><p>"Elder Shen was there!  Hey, where's Elder Shen?"</p><p>...</p><p>The island fell into chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the black hole, his expression grave.  The hole was pitch black, and for some reason, it filled him with a sense of foreboding, a feeling that intensified as the hole expanded.</p><p>Suddenly, a grey mist erupted from the black hole.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A earth-shattering roar silenced everyone.  They stared dumbfounded at the sky as the grey mist burst from the black hole, unleashing immense, violent power, crashing down.</p><p>A grey waterfall appeared in the void.</p><p>Even from a distance, everyone felt the destructive force, their hearts pounding in fear.</p><p>The grey mist surged downwards.</p><p>Those within the Bloodwood Array were the first to be hit.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>Escape attempts flew from the Bloodwood Array; Su Zinan and the others were in disarray, glancing back with expressions of terror.</p><p>The grey mist was an incredibly violent, chaotic current.</p><p>The Bloodwood Array was ripped to shreds. The black hole was gone, and an endless stream of grey mist poured out, a chaotic maelstrom within, spreading outwards with frightening speed.</p><p>Qin Sang understood how it could level an entire island.</p><p>The sight reminded him of the Purple Micro Palace's ascension.</p><p>Spatial rifts also contained terrifying spatial currents. Even with the protection of the ascension platform, only cultivators at the late Nascent Soul stage could protect themselves.</p><p>Of course, the two currents were different.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly sense chaotic restrictive forces within the grey mist, most likely caused by the destruction of a spirit array or a secret realm.</p><p>Even a Transcendental cultivator likely couldn't have created such a spirit array—it was likely an ancient immortal array. The depth of the Wuwang Palace's resources was beyond imagination.</p><p>Time had passed.</p><p>The Wuwang Palace had long become history. Recently, some ancient texts have been unearthed, but the relevant records are scarce and unreliable.</p><p>According to research, the Wuwang Palace in its prime was a superpower spanning the mainland and the East Sea, possibly jointly ruled by humans and demons.</p><p>The coexistence of the two races within one power is unimaginable to today's cultivators.</p><p>Now, humans and demons are divided, and the Wuwang Palace is in ruins. Thankfully, the Central Plains are vast, and the sea area between the mainland and the East Sea is sufficiently wide and desolate.</p><p>The roaring continued, deafening.</p><p>In just a quarter of an hour, the chaotic currents covered a large expanse of sea, their expansion slowing only slightly. The area became a storm zone, blotting out the sun.</p><p>Surrounding waters were affected, giant waves crashing.</p><p>Qin Sang deployed his protective true energy to withstand the gale, shifting his gaze to Su Zinan and the others at the edge of the current.</p><p>Su Zinan’s face was pale, but thankfully he had escaped quickly enough to avoid the worst of the impact.  He channeled his spiritual energy, his voice overriding the storm, “Which fellow cultivator is willing to help me enter the Wuwang Hall? My previous offer still stands!”</p><p>Silence stretched across the distance.</p><p>After a moment, someone shouted back, “Daoist Su, do you intend to traverse these turbulent currents and enter the deepest part?”</p><p>Su Zinan’s reply was unexpected, “I don’t know much about the Wuwang Hall. Whether it lies within the depths of these currents is something we'll only know once we're inside.”</p><p>A commotion rippled through the assembled cultivators.</p><p>The previous failures of the Baguan Scenic Area and the Ganlu Zen Monastery served as cautionary tales.  Common sense dictated that any cultivator with self-awareness would avoid accompanying Su Zinan on such a perilous venture, lest they suffer the same fate.</p><p>However, Su Zinan’s ability to pinpoint the Wuwang Hall so quickly, coupled with his clearly exceptional bloodwood formation, suggested he possessed some secret knowledge.</p><p>Everyone weighed the risks and rewards; for the moment, no one responded.</p><p>Su Zinan shook his head, about to lead his small party into the turbulent currents, when another voice called out, “Daoist Su, can you tell us why you seek entry to the Wuwang Hall?  Since you’ve declared you’ll forgo all treasures, it’s not for treasure, is it?”</p><p>Su Zinan was silent for a moment before replying, “To find someone!”</p><p>To find someone!</p><p>The words caused an uproar.  Rumors of a trapped Nascent Soul cultivator within the Wuwang Hall had been circulating for some time, first involving the Baguan Scenic Area and the Ganlu Zen Monastery, and now Su Zinan.</p><p>“Who?” someone immediately pressed.</p><p>Su Zinan scanned the area, unable to locate the speaker.  He replied coldly, “I'll wait ten breaths!”</p><p>Nine breaths passed in an instant.</p><p>As the final breath concluded, a streak of light shone from a distant island, and an old man, his hair and beard as white as snow, flew before Su Zinan, bowing his head slightly, “I will accompany Daoist Su.”</p><p>Su Zinan was overjoyed.  He studied the elder, surprised, “Are you the Master of the Qiling Cave?”</p><p>The elder chuckled, “I didn’t expect Daoist Su to know my humble name.  It’s an honor.”</p><p>“Master is too modest. The Master of the Qiling Cave in South Prefecture – who doesn’t know your name?  To finally meet you is my great honor!”</p><p>Su Zinan’s enthusiasm was evident.</p><p>Seeing no others respond besides the Qiling Cave Master, Su Zinan didn’t hesitate, leading his group into the turbulent currents.</p><p>As soon as they entered, various streaks of light flickered across the islands, flying near the currents.  After sensing their power, most cultivators turned back.  A Golden Core cultivator entering this place would likely not survive long enough to find any treasure.</p><p>However, Su Zinan’s actions had attracted several Nascent Soul cultivators, some alone, others in pairs.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the currents alone.</p><p>He chose not to accompany Su Zinan.  Years ago, he had used his sword formation, demonic fire, and the Sun God Tree against the old man Wu.  If he encountered any danger inside, it would be impossible to keep this secret. He would then face the combined attack of three powerful cultivators, a situation to avoid at all costs.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had a nagging feeling that Su Zinan’s motives were not entirely pure.  If Old Demon Lu was indeed trapped in the Wuwang Hall, it contradicted Yuefei’s account.  It was still necessary to investigate.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed into the turbulent currents.</p><p>The outermost areas were relatively easy, allowing him to avoid the worst of the impact by dodging, but the currents shifted rapidly. Not far in, they became extremely dense, requiring him to endure their force directly.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Ruyi Treasure Pearl, activating a protective energy shield.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly scouted the surroundings for him.</p><p>He could see other cultivators on either side, all heading in the same direction as him, evidently following Su Zinan.</p><p>Ignoring them, Qin Sang focused the Butterfly on maintaining a fixed bearing on Su Zinan.</p><p>They traveled only a short distance when Qin Sang suddenly stopped.</p><p>Although nothing appeared to be different, he felt an unusual change in the atmosphere, as if he had entered a different space.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Several turbulent currents struck simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed as he was hit by several chaotic forces, accompanied by continuous rumbling sounds.  His energy shield shook violently, flickering erratically.  He quickly increased his spiritual energy to stabilize it.</p><p>“Hmph…the power of the currents is already this strong before even reaching the inner area!  Nascent Soul cultivators at the initial stage, without sufficiently strong defensive abilities, will be forced to turn back.”</p><p>Qin Sang prepared himself and continued forward, observing that the cultivator on his left had indeed been unable to keep up.</p><p>Further on, it became increasingly difficult; more and more cultivators fell behind, able only to search nearby for any potential discoveries.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression grew increasingly grave.  He had investigated the scene of the last relic’s opening on the Chi Nan island chain, and while the outer currents were strong, they were nothing compared to this.</p>
