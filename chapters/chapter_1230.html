<h1>Chapter 1222: A Visit</h1><p>“Master Qingfeng…”</p><p>Yinquan Sect.</p><p>Sect Master Dong felt uneasy facing Qin Sang.  Years ago, he supported Lu Xing’s advancement to Golden Core, launching an attack on the Moyan Sect, intending to annex it.  Unexpectedly, Master Qingfeng, missing for a hundred years, returned and, before Dong’s very eyes, killed Lu Xing with a single strike, a swift cleansing.</p><p>He stood beside Lu Xing, unable to react, helplessly watching him turn to ash.  Even now, Dong Master wakes in a cold sweat every midnight.</p><p>If Master Qingfeng had targeted him, Dong Master estimated his chances of escape at only 70%. He could only be grateful that Qingfeng seemed to be wary of the Qingyang Demon Sect, and thus refrained from a massacre.  Even the most powerful cultivator wouldn't dare act recklessly under a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>His guess proved correct. Master Qingfeng remained remarkably low-key afterward, and the Moyan Sect obediently followed the Qingyang Demon Sect’s orders. They showed no ambition for expansion.</p><p>This relieved Dong Master; at least Yinquan Sect wouldn't be swallowed up or replaced. He instructed his disciples to avoid Moyan Sect members at all costs; the best policy was to stay out of each other’s way.</p><p>Three days later, Xiang Qing summoned the vassal sects for a meeting.</p><p>The Moyan Sect, with only a single, newly Golden Core Sect Master, was insignificant.  Attendance at such meetings was optional as long as tribute was paid.  Yet, Master Qingfeng appeared, requesting to attend together.</p><p>“Is there some difficulty, Sect Master Dong?” Qin Sang asked casually, surveying Yinquan Sect.</p><p>Sect Master Dong chuckled nervously, repeatedly saying, “No, no… It’s an honor to travel with Master Qingfeng! I plan to depart early tomorrow to avoid any suspicion of disrespect from the Qingyang Demon Sect.”</p><p>“I share your sentiment. I shall trouble you for lodgings tonight.”</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning, Qin Sang and Sect Master Dong, along with their disciples, set off.</p><p>During this time, Sect Master Dong found Qin Sang surprisingly affable, showing no resentment towards his past schemes against the Moyan Sect. His fear subsided, replaced by a desire to forge an alliance.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect was merely a nominal overlord, not interfering in the conflicts among its subordinate sects.  A collaboration between their two sects wasn't impossible, and could yield great achievements.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang wasn't interested in such petty matters, leaving Dong Master's efforts wasted. He was preoccupied with the upcoming trip to the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>He needed to directly absorb and refine the Ancestral Saint Fire, which would inevitably alert the Shen Gang Peak.  His previous stealth methods would be useless. Xiang Qing wasn't easily manipulated.</p><p>Based on his intel, Qin Sang decided on a direct visit.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Qingyang Demon Sect's mountain gate, numerous disciples stood alert, awaiting guests. Since Grandmaster Xiang’s breakthrough to Yuan Ying, the Qingyang Demon Sect had regained its former glory.</p><p>Xiang Qing’s reputation rivaled the Mysterious Void Demon Lord, his status paramount. Every disciple felt immense pride and joy.</p><p>Qin Sang and Sect Master Dong ascended the jade steps.  Yinquan Sect held considerable sway in the Demon Path; seeing their arrival, the Qingyang Demon Sect disciples fell silent and stepped forward to greet them.</p><p>“Welcome, Sect Master Dong and…”</p><p>A Foundation Establishment youth emerged, bowing respectfully.  He hesitated upon seeing Qin Sang, unsure of the masked figure’s identity.</p><p>“This is Master Qingfeng, the founder of Moyan Sect, attending with me to meet Senior Xiang.”  Dong Master introduced.</p><p>Moyan Sect…</p><p>The youth racked his brains, unable to recall such a figure. Yet, recognizing a genuine Golden Core cultivator, he didn't dare be negligent.  He bowed, “Greetings, Master Qingfeng. The Grandmaster has given instructions; please follow me to the Guest Peak for your stay.”</p><p>“We thank you.”</p><p>Dong Master’s demeanor was amiable.  The youth felt a surge of pride, knowing this was a testament to their Grandmaster's influence.</p><p>They passed the monumental stele, entering the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang, revisiting familiar sights, stopped the youth, asking, “I heard that Bing Han, Sect Master of the Xu Ling Sect, is currently visiting.  Is that true?”</p><p>The youth looked puzzled, replying, “Forgive me, Master, I don’t know.”</p><p>Dong Master looked at Qin Sang in surprise, wondering where this old demon had acquired such information.</p><p>“Why ask about Bing Han?  This old demon wouldn't have some ulterior motive, would he?” Dong Master mused. With a Yuan Ying Grandmaster, this man must be courting death.</p><p>Guest Peak was the mountain closest to the Qingyang Demon Sect's inner sect.</p><p>Everyone followed the young man as he flew slowly.</p><p>As they neared Yingke Peak, a bright light suddenly appeared ahead.  Upon closer inspection, it was a powerfully built man in armor.</p><p>“Why, it’s Dong!”</p><p>The man saw them, laughed heartily, changed direction, and flew towards them, shouting, “Dong, I’ve been wanting to spar with you! Last time you ran away, but I see where you’re hiding this time!”</p><p>Master Dong’s expression darkened.</p><p>In the Demon Path, aside from the major sects with Yuan Ying masters, several other powerful sects could rival the Yinquan Sect. This man's sect was one of them.</p><p>Moreover, the man's cultivation surpassed Master Dong's, reaching the peak of late Golden Core stage.</p><p>The two had always been at odds.  Knowing he was no match, Master Dong had avoided the man, pretending to be busy.  He hadn't expected him back from the front lines.</p><p>"That's the Quanyi Sect Master I told you about, the self-proclaimed Mountain-Shaking God-King. He has a terrible temper,"</p><p>Master Dong transmitted a warning to Qin Sang.</p><p>But Qin Sang ignored him, flying towards the inner gate of the Qingyang Demon Sect. He stopped at the entrance, gazing into the depths of the inner sect, causing the Qingyang disciples guarding the gate to be on high alert.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions were very conspicuous.</p><p>The Mountain-Shaking God-King, still entangled with Master Dong, was also drawn to his attention.</p><p>Qin Sang simply used a simple spell to suppress his cultivation; it wasn't something the Mountain-Shaking God-King could easily see through.</p><p>The Mountain-Shaking God-King sensed Qin Sang was a fellow cultivator, but his aura indicated he had only recently achieved Golden Core. He sneered at Master Dong, "Is that kid a newly promoted disciple of yours? So arrogant! He doesn't even come to greet his elders! Hiding his abilities and playing tricks—it's just like you."</p><p>Master Dong’s mind raced. If this man angered Daoist Qingfeng, it might be a chance to use him to their advantage. He immediately rebuked, "Mountain-Shaking Devil, this is the Qingyang Demon Sect! Don't be so reckless!"</p><p>The Mountain-Shaking God-King grinned, about to use this as an excuse to teach him a lesson, but noticing Master Dong's expression, he sensed something was amiss and hesitated.</p><p>Master Dong inwardly regretted the missed opportunity.</p><p>The young man from Qingyang Sect opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>Then,</p><p>a deep voice suddenly boomed from within the inner gate of the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>"I wonder which fellow cultivator is seeking to test my patience and nearly caused me to be remiss in my hospitality?"</p>
