<h1>Chapter 1951: The Chase</h1><p>The Fire Domain.</p><p>Here, even the wind took shape, the shape of flames.</p><p>Blazing infernos, like flames adrift on the surface of magma, howled as they came and went.</p><p>Heaven and earth, save for crimson, held no other color.</p><p>Occasionally, 'splashes' could be seen within the magma, strange figures flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>This was a pure ocean of magma, devoid of any land. Only fire beasts with unique bloodlines, and fire spirits born from the flames, could survive here.</p><p>Unafraid of the harsh environment, they weaved through the magma like fish in water.</p><p>Suddenly, the fiery winds stilled for a moment, revealing two ethereal figures.</p><p>These two were Ling Shi and Gui Hou.</p><p>Gui Hou, a Fire Jade Centipede coiled around his arm, seemed to be communicating with it, then pointed downwards.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ling, it's here! Lord Zhu Que mentioned before that some Dark Devil Lily Flowers grow beneath this magma.  I just don't know if their medicinal properties will meet your requirements."</p><p>"Dark Devil Lily Flowers prefer to grow in places where the power of flames is most potent and violent, absorbing fire toxins as nourishment. The environment greatly influences their quality. If I were using them myself, high-grade Dark Devil Lily Flowers would suffice. However, this time, I need to refine a virulent poison requested by Senior, and it requires top-grade quality."</p><p>Ling Shi twitched his nose slightly, sensing the surroundings with a secret technique, and nodded. "This place is suitable. It has the potential to nurture top-grade Dark Devil Lily Flowers. Let's go down and take a look!"</p><p>The two plummeted downwards, the magma parting on either side before closing seamlessly, returning to normal.</p><p>The magma was bottomless.</p><p>Gui Hou led the way, descending continuously, and asked via voice transmission, "Fellow Daoist Ling, do you mean that there are only a few top-grade flowers in the entire patch? How many are needed to refine the virulent poison?"</p><p>"The more, the better!" Ling Shi replied.</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Gui Hou frowned. "I'm afraid there aren't many such places in the entire Fire Domain, and once they reach a certain size, they're usually claimed. The three major sects of the Fire Domain are all proficient in fire-based cultivation methods, and there are numerous other factions, large and small.  Even if they don't cultivate Dark Devil Lily Flowers, they can develop the area into medicinal fields."</p><p>"Let's do our best. It's not the only option! Besides, Senior is incredibly powerful and surely has a way.  If he wants to unify the Fire Domain, it would be a simple matter." Ling Shi said casually.</p><p>Brought back by Qin Sang, Ling Shi had been apprehensive at first but now felt at ease.</p><p>Here, he only needed to focus on comprehending the Dao of Poisons and refining various virulent poisons.  Qin Sang would fully support any request.</p><p>This kind of treatment was usually reserved for Grandmasters of Alchemy.</p><p>Although there was a saying that alchemy and poison refinement were two sides of the same coin, and Ling Shi did know some alchemy, his cultivation of poison techniques wasn't solely for refining poisons. Lacking a true alchemical heritage, he couldn't compare to a true Alchemy Grandmaster.</p><p>The price was restricted freedom, but he had already been targeted by the Soulfall Abyss, leaving him no choice.</p><p>Gui Hou, however, couldn't be as carefree as Ling Shi. He shook his head and said, "That being said, as subordinates, we must do our best to alleviate Master's worries."</p><p>As they spoke, they descended to an extreme depth.</p><p>The temperature here hadn't decreased; instead, the scorching, frenzied aura nurtured by heaven and earth became even more intense.</p><p>Gradually, the magma became indistinguishable to the naked eye, transforming into pure streams of fire flowing from all directions.</p><p>It was unimaginable what apocalyptic scene would unfold if these forces were unleashed.</p><p>"Fire Domain cultivators call this place a Blazing Pool.  The power of flames undergoes a transformation here.  Even within a powerful Blazing Pool, we must be cautious. Dark Devil Lily Flowers are connected to the Blazing Pool's energy. We must be careful when harvesting them, lest we cause the Blazing Pool to erupt."</p><p>Gui Hou warned.</p><p>As he spoke, they descended further, deliberately slowing down.</p><p>The surrounding scenery changed drastically, and even these two Nascent Soul cultivators felt a primal sense of oppression.</p><p>Without any warning, the surroundings suddenly became calm.</p><p>Here, not a single turbulent current could be seen.</p><p>Yet, this tranquility felt incredibly eerie, as if immense power was accumulating, ready to erupt and destroy everything at any moment.</p><p>There was fire here too, burning quietly. The flames were a faint blue, swaying gently, giving a deceptively fragile impression.</p><p>They carefully entered this space, avoiding the flames, and soon found a shadowy area amidst the blue flames.</p><p>The shadow wasn't entirely dark, emitting a dim blue light.</p><p>Within the light, scattered sparsely, were flowers resembling lilies, their petals also a dark blue, some deep and some lighter in color.</p><p>There was no soil here. They floated, and one could clearly see countless blue roots growing from their base, extending into the flames, absorbing 'nutrients' from the fire.</p><p>"One, two… there are actually five top-grade Dark Devil Lily Flowers!"</p><p>Ling Shi's face lit up with joy. He had expected at most two or three.</p><p>He flashed to the side of a top-grade Dark Devil Lily Flower and extended his right hand towards the root ball.</p><p>His fingers twitched slightly, and strange fluctuations emanated from his fingertips, enveloping the root ball.</p><p>Ling Shi concentrated, his movements gentle yet decisive. He gently cradled the root ball and then patiently, one by one, teased the roots out of the flames.</p><p>It took him about ten days to harvest a single Dark Devil Lily Flower.</p><p>Gui Hou watched him retrieve a complete flower and then offered his assistance.</p><p>Just as the two were engrossed in harvesting the spirit flowers, they suddenly sensed something and stopped, exchanging glances.</p><p>"Someone's coming!" Gui Hou said gravely.</p><p>This magma was teeming with countless fire beasts and fire spirits, inherently chaotic.</p><p>While harvesting herbs in the Blazing Pool, they couldn't be acutely aware of every fluctuation outside. If someone was merely passing by, they wouldn't be alerted.</p><p>However, this newcomer seemed unusual, fleeing in panic as if being chased, plunging headlong into this area.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi, possessing ample composure, didn't act rashly.  They judged the intruder's direction of movement based on the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>"He's not coming here," Gui Hou's expression eased slightly.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, they sensed another aura, hot on the heels of the first.</p><p>Ling Shi muttered, "As expected," then added in surprise, "It's actually two Nascent Soul cultivators!"</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were rare in the Fire Domain. To encounter two at once, and they were chasing each other…</p><p>"There might be people from the three major sects of the Fire Domain, but it has nothing to do with us.  The task at hand is more important," Gui Hou shook his head, but then noticed Ling Shi's strange expression.</p><p>"The one behind is a Corpse Demon from the Soulfall Abyss!"</p><p>Ling Shi's eyes flashed with a cold glint.  He sneered, "These things, neither human nor ghost, that corpse stench, I can smell it even through the magma!"</p><p>…</p><p>Upper Level.</p><p>A crimson streak of light zipped through the magma at high speed.</p><p>Within the escaping light was a powerfully built man. If Qin Sang were here, he would recognize this person as Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect.  Qin Sang's avatar had lured Fu Xiao here when he eradicated the Sand Bandits.</p><p>Now, Fu Xiao's sturdy frame was hunched, his face ashen, clearly seriously injured.</p><p>There was a gaping hole in his chest, his robes pierced through.</p><p>The wound nearly went straight through to his back, his internal organs undoubtedly severely damaged.</p><p>The most troublesome thing wasn't the injury itself but the layer of green flames covering the wound.</p><p>This green fire clung to his flesh like a leech, preventing the wound from healing and devouring his life force. Even consuming countless healing pills was useless.</p><p>'Huff! Huff! Huff!'</p><p>As he fled, Fu Xiao formed hand seals and spewed a ball of spiritual fire.</p><p>The spiritual fire landed on his chest, entangling with the green fire, but unable to eliminate it.</p><p>He spat out several more mouthfuls, only managing to temporarily suppress the green fire.</p><p>Moreover, he discovered a more terrifying phenomenon: the green fire was silently invading his internal organs.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, he had several methods to extinguish the green fire. But now, gravely injured and with pursuers behind him, his situation was precarious, and no method was effective.</p><p>He mentally calculated the distance to his sect, growing more anxious. At this rate, he would die before reaching safety.</p><p>He had stumbled upon the Corpse Demon's hiding place but hadn't anticipated another lurking in the shadows.  Caught off guard, he was ambushed, and the artifact for contacting his sect was destroyed. He was truly alone and helpless.</p><p>Behind him, that sinister aura relentlessly pursued, rapidly closing in.</p><p>Chasing him was a green flame, highly conspicuous within the magma.</p><p>Fu Xiao, cultivating the Six Harmonies Sect's true inheritance techniques, was like a fish in water within the magma, his speed lightning fast. Yet, this green flame was no less swift!</p><p>Within the green flame was also a tall figure, appearing even more imposing than Fu Xiao. It was one of the individuals Qin Sang had alerted when he activated the copper pillar.</p><p>The others were nowhere to be seen, only this tall man pursuing Fu Xiao alone.</p><p>"Hmph! If Lord Fei Luo hadn't returned to report and Rou Ji hadn't been injured, you wouldn't have escaped alive!  Stay here!"</p><p>The tall man snarled, his robes billowing.  Suddenly, streams of green flames erupted from his body, transforming him into a man of fire.</p><p>The green fire spread, instantly dyeing the surrounding magma green.  The green magma instantly shifted from scorching hot to deathly cold.</p><p>The green fire spread rapidly.  Just as Fu Xiao sensed something amiss, he was already surrounded by the green magma.  A premonition of danger surged within him.</p><p>Without warning, a ghastly white claw emerged from the green fire, its five fingers like sharp swords, grabbing towards his back.</p><p>If this blow landed, Fu Xiao would surely be in dire straits.</p><p>Fortunately, he was prepared.  A fiery red pattern, formed of flames, appeared on his back, resembling a Bagua but with subtle differences.</p><p>The Bagua fire diagram appeared, and a muffled thunderclap resounded.</p><p>Struck by the ghostly claw, the fire diagram trembled violently, cracks appearing, but it successfully blocked the claw for an instant.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity and dashed forward. He should have been able to create some distance, but he suddenly felt a gust of yin wind.</p><p>The ghostly claw, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, materialized in front of him, aimed directly at his face.</p><p>Fu Xiao was horrified, but amidst his panic, a ruthless glint flashed in his eyes.  He opened his mouth wide, but instead of flames, he spat out a bead.</p><p>This bead was exceptionally brilliant, called the Crimson Seal Bead. It was a treasure Fu Xiao relied heavily upon, and now, to escape, he could only bear the pain of destroying it!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Crimson Seal Bead shot towards the ghostly claw.  The claw immediately sensed the danger and curled its fingers, about to retreat into the green magma.</p><p>But the claw was too close to Fu Xiao, and Fu Xiao had planned this, his timing impeccable.</p><p>'Boom!' The Crimson Seal Bead exploded. A fire serpent, entwined with fragments, surged forth, teeth and claws bared.</p><p>A roar echoed from within the magma.  The ghostly claw, unable to retreat in time, simply remained, its five fingers spreading wide. Embedded in its palm was a black eye, swiveling left and right like a living thing, utterly bizarre.</p><p>The eye blinked, and a black beam shot from its pupil, meeting the fire serpent formed by the Crimson Seal Bead.</p><p>The moment the two forces collided, a figure vaguely appeared behind the ghostly claw, retreating backwards.</p><p>The Crimson Seal Bead's power was immense, instantly destroying the black beam.</p><p>The tall man appeared rather dishevelled but hadn't suffered any serious injuries, having dodged most of the blast.</p><p>However, the green fire that had permeated the magma could no longer be sustained.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity and escaped. He flicked his sleeves, sending several streaks of light shooting towards his enemy, then, without looking back, chose a direction and fled with all his might.</p><p>He remembered the location of a Six Harmonies Sect ruin from thousands of years ago.</p><p>The brief clash had drastically worsened his injuries. He knew that with his own strength alone, escaping the demon's grasp was almost impossible.</p><p>He hoped the ruin was still there. It was his only hope!</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi temporarily stopped harvesting and quietly left the Blazing Pool.</p><p>They hadn't approached the battlefield too closely, but judging from the fluctuations emanating from there, they could deduce what had transpired with reasonable accuracy.</p><p>"It's the Six Harmonies Sect's Azure Sky Decree!" Gui Hou rarely ventured out, but he was familiar with the surrounding forces, especially the three major sects of the Fire Domain.</p><p>"A Corpse Demon from the Soulfall Abyss, chasing a Six Harmonies Sect expert here.  Don't you find it strange, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Ling Shi was eager to get involved. "The Soulfall Abyss is extending its clutches into the Fire Domain again.  There must be a sinister plot! We'd better investigate this thoroughly and be prepared, lest it disturb the Dao Field and affect Senior's cultivation!"</p><p>Gui Hou glanced at Ling Shi. He knew that Ling Shi had a grudge against the Soulfall Abyss and certainly wanted to seize this opportunity for revenge.</p><p>Ling Shi's words did carry some weight.</p><p>However, Gui Hou also had to consider whether their intervention, originally unnecessary, might attract the attention of a Soulfall Abyss ancestor.</p><p>Gui Hou had followed Qin Sang from the Rune Realm to the Great Thousand World and knew that Qin Sang hadn't reached the Void Refinement stage through normal means.  Facing a true Void Refinement cultivator, Qin Sang might not have the advantage.  It would be best to consolidate his foundation and avoid such encounters for as long as possible.</p><p>"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. That guy isn't a particularly important figure in the Soulfall Abyss.  He's definitely not the only one who has infiltrated the Fire Domain.  The old devil has several Nascent Soul late-stage demons under his command. The loss of a single Corpse Demon wouldn't even make him blink," Ling Shi asserted confidently.</p><p>Just as they were at an impasse, they suddenly heard a voice.</p><p>They immediately stopped, expressions of respect appearing on their faces.  They listened attentively for a moment, then bowed respectfully towards the void.</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>After the voice disappeared, they straightened up.</p><p>Ling Shi laughed heartily.  "As expected, Senior has already seen through everything!"</p><p>Gui Hou offered no comment. He looked ahead and hurried after the fleeing cultivator. "Fellow Daoist Ling, we need to discuss our strategy. Master wants him alive. We must ensure success.  We'll have to rely on your poison skills."</p><p>"Certainly!  The Soulfall Abyss's Corpse Demons constantly refine corpse poison. Ordinary toxins are ineffective against them.  However, my poison techniques are a different matter. I'll make sure he doesn't leave this place alive!"</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Dao Field.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sat cross-legged on a stone bed, surrounded by twinkling stars. (End of Chapter)</p>
