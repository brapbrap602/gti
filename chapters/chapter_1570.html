<h1>Chapter 1561: The Postnatal Wooden Golem Stele</h1><p>“Wood Spirit Aura?”</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.</p><p>Having known Lu Zhang for decades, he had some understanding of his strength.  Facing a Grand Cultivator, Lu Zhang should at least be able to hold his own for a while, not be completely powerless to resist.</p><p>He never expected the opponent's poison to be so vicious that Lu Zhang wasn't even a match for a single blow. Even more unexpectedly, the opponent's target was him.</p><p>He was filled with questions.</p><p>What kind of aura was this person referring to when he kept mentioning Wood Spirit Aura?</p><p>Bai had clearly stated that although the Dao Manifestation Tree was a spirit tree, it possessed a pristine, untainted nature.</p><p>Having cultivated an external embodiment using the Dao Manifestation Tree, Qin Sang himself hadn't sensed any unusual aura from it.</p><p>Before this, no one had ever seen through the Dao Manifestation Tree's true nature.</p><p>Especially after his Nascent Soul transformed from illusory to substantial, he could even conceal the identity of his external embodiment. His true body and embodiment played two separate roles, and Lu Zhang was still in the dark.</p><p>Of course, this also had to do with Qin Sang's cautious nature. He tried his best to avoid having his embodiment directly face Grand Cultivators. When he visited Mount Bu Nian, he deliberately chose a time to avoid the sect's leader.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a true mishap had occurred.</p><p>The strange-faced man sized Qin Sang up and down, his greed undisguised.  His gaze seemed to want to strip Qin Sang bare. He inhaled, a look of intoxication on his face, his features twisting, making him appear even more terrifying.</p><p>“So pure, truly the purest I've ever seen. Could it be one of the legendary Ten Divine Wood? Heaven has been kind to me! I was just planning to cultivate the Postnatal Wooden Golem Stele, and fate has delivered you right to my doorstep…”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The jade beetle flew back into the strange-faced man’s hand.</p><p>The strange-faced man toyed with the jade beetle and said indifferently, "Hand it over, and I'll give you a chance for a fair trade. One treasure in exchange for the lives of you two!"</p><p>His tone was full of confidence.</p><p>In fact, he had the capital to be confident.</p><p>Although he hadn't managed to poison Lu Zhang outright as he had envisioned, this result was still astonishing enough.  A venerable Enforcement Elder of Mount Bu Nian, severely injured in a single exchange, hiding within a green bell, his life or death unknown.</p><p>With that single probe, the strange-faced man could tell that the green bell was extraordinary, likely Lu Zhang's strongest life-saving measure, and it wouldn't be easy to break through in a short time.</p><p>It would be strange if Lu Zhang, coming from a prestigious sect, didn't have such life-saving means.</p><p>However, the strange-faced man was certain that, afflicted with the Gu King's poison, Lu Zhang wouldn't be able to recover his fighting strength easily.</p><p>…</p><p>So the opponent hadn't seen through the Dao Manifestation Tree.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. Staring at the strange-faced man’s vine-like arm and branch-shaped hand, he had a vague guess, suspecting it was related to the man’s cultivation technique or divine ability, granting him a special kind of spiritual sense.</p><p>The opponent was after his true body, how could he hand it over?</p><p>Just now, Lu Zhang, using his remaining strength, had broken free from the strange-faced man’s grasp and landed not far from Qin Sang.  At the last moment, he transmitted his voice, his voice weak, like a whisper.</p><p>“I have a way to suppress the virulent poison within me. The Meditation Bell can help us escape. I hope Daoist Priest can buy us some time…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Meditation Bell inconspicuously, his thoughts racing.  He said coldly, “First a sneak attack to steal treasures, then poisoning to harm others, and you dare to speak of a fair trade? Don't you find that laughable?”</p><p>As he spoke, the Snow Treading Divine Blade shot back. Qin Sang scooped up the Meditation Bell and left.</p><p>“Incorrigibly stubborn!”</p><p>The strange-faced man snorted coldly.  “Kill him!”</p><p>Without needing a reminder, the grey-robed man had already made his move.</p><p>He was more interested in Lu Zhang inside the Meditation Bell. After all, whatever treasure was obtained from Qin Sang would belong to his master, while the Stone Toad would be his.</p><p>The Five-Colored Whip cracked, and illusory poisonous whips exploded in the void like blossoming poisonous flowers, ubiquitous, vibrant yet dangerous.</p><p>The strange-faced man’s right hand remained in its vine-like form, his rough palm wide open. He grabbed the wooden bead, and a rich green light suddenly erupted in his palm.</p><p>Wherever the light shone, vitality was sown upon the smooth, mirror-like stones and walls, sprouting a layer of tender green shoots, full of life.</p><p>The shoots grew rapidly, forming patches of grassland, the wild grass growing wildly, transforming into countless vines. The vines were covered in thorns, more agile than venomous snakes, shooting outwards.</p><p>In an instant, the entire space transformed into a barrier woven from vines.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was filled with a rich green, with clusters of poisonous flowers blooming around him.  His situation was extremely dangerous.</p><p>There was no anxiety on his face as one hand grasped the Meditation Bell.</p><p>The Meditation Bell was light, weightless in his hand.</p><p>As he grasped the Meditation Bell, Qin Sang sensed its power rapidly draining away, a shocking sight.</p><p>Lu Zhang had nearly lost his life this time. Although he had temporarily preserved it, he would pay a heavy price.  The Meditation Bell was likely to be destroyed because of this.</p><p>After transmitting his voice and escaping into the Meditation Bell, Lu Zhang fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang now had to face two opponents alone, one of whom was a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>It was a pity his true body wasn't here, otherwise, how could he tolerate the opponent’s arrogance!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, putting aside distracting thoughts.  A Profound Qi giant hand burst forth from his crown.</p><p>The giant hand clenched, and the surrounding vines solidified.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, Qin Sang urged the Snow Treading Divine Blade, turning and slashing behind him, forcibly carving a path through the countless vines, retreating rapidly outwards, unable to retrieve the Treasure-Colored Bell, forced to abandon it.</p><p>Blade Qi surged like a tide.</p><p>Stone walls collapsed one after another.</p><p>The underground was in chaos. Low-level cultivators searching for treasures in the basin felt the ground trembling frequently, thinking an earthquake had occurred at the basin’s center.</p><p>Qin Sang fled quickly, and the vines pursued just as swiftly.</p><p>The strange-faced man held the wooden bead aloft, his feet unmoving.  Countless vines undulated like ocean waves, pushing him forward, flattening everything in his path.</p><p>Green light moved with his figure.</p><p>Once the green light moved away, the wild grass and vines withered at a speed visible to the naked eye, eventually disappearing completely, while new vines grew ahead.</p><p>As for the poisonous flowers, Qin Sang unceremoniously crashed straight through them.</p><p>Some toxins seeped through his protective True Essence and entered his body.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that the effect of this poison was similar to miasma, primarily threatening the physical body, having a limited impact on him, so he paid it no mind.</p><p>If it were the strange-faced man’s Gu King poison, he definitely wouldn't dare to be so arrogant, but the strange-faced man showed no signs of using the Gu King.</p><p>Seeing his meticulously cultivated poison techniques ineffective, the grey-robed man was both shocked and furious. He quickly retracted the Five-Colored Whip, whistled, and summoned the Five-Colored Poison Spider to chase after Qin Sang.</p><p>Behind him, waves of vines rolled, the strange-faced man appearing and disappearing intermittently.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed the Four-Carriage Serpent Seal in his sleeve, but he wasn't in a hurry to use it.</p><p>Deploying a spiritual treasure would certainly improve his situation.</p><p>However, spiritual treasures consumed a great deal of True Essence, and the strange-faced man wouldn't just stand there and take a beating. He had to consider how to escape if the spiritual treasure couldn't repel his opponent.</p><p>Lu Zhang claimed to have a method of escape, but Qin Sang wouldn’t entirely entrust his life to someone else.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang suddenly changed direction, not upwards, but counterintuitively, towards the depths of the earth.</p><p>The further down he went, the thicker the miasma became, obscuring vision and blurring his opponent’s perception.</p><p>He could completely allow the poisonous miasma to envelop his body, offering no resistance, suppressing his own fluctuations to the minimum, concealing his movements.</p><p>The premise was that he could temporarily shake off his pursuers.</p>
