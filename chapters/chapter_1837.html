<h1>Chapter 1828: Self-Destructive Attack</h1><p>Nine Sunbirds emerged simultaneously!</p><p>Crimson Nanming Lihuo fire gathered before Qin Sang's chest, forming a blazing sun.</p><p>This attack was clearly premeditated.  Since the Sunbirds were summoned by the young Suzaku spirit, Qin Sang didn't need to divert her attention during the battle.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly, Qin Sang, and the young Suzaku spirit coordinated perfectly at this moment, leaving their opponent no chance whatsoever!</p><p>True essence poured out like a broken dam.</p><p>Since engaging Xia Hou, Qin Sang had stored away her four-carriage snake seal, and only occasionally used her Grey Warbler sword, conserving her true essence for this very moment!</p><p>The intense flames seared Xia Hou's eyes and shook its spirit, its pupils constricting in shock.</p><p>The red sun reflected in its eyes, as did Qin Sang's gaze—a calm, indifferent expression.</p><p>This calmness, in Xia Hou's eyes, was the height of madness.</p><p>The red sun expanded, its overwhelmingly powerful force about to erupt. Yet, Qin Sang continued to grapple with it, showing no sign of retreat, treating the danger as nothing.</p><p>Her resolve was to die with her opponent!</p><p>What else could this be called but madness?</p><p>Among cultivators who had reached their level of power, there were many who were brave and ruthless, but few would risk their lives for an external goal.</p><p>Xia Hou was greatly alarmed. It tried to break free from Qin Sang, to dodge, but the appearance of the Sun Tree and the eruption of the Nanming Lihuo were too sudden.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>An intense crimson light burst forth from both their chests, and the raging flames instantly engulfed both the deer and the person.</p><p>The flames continued to expand, fiery pythons dancing wildly, the firelight illuminating the palace in an overwhelming crimson glow, obscuring all vision.</p><p>Xia Hou's eyes were bloodshot, and in its desperate struggle, its body contorted and deformed. It had just had its deer shadow technique interrupted by a tribulation thunderbolt; the shadow was still in mid-air, out of reach!</p><p>At this moment, the restraints binding Xia Hou vanished.</p><p>But its fear didn't lessen in the slightest.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The deer shadow shattered.</p><p>Xia Hou's blood surged, and a faint deer shadow reappeared, seemingly trying to shield Xia Hou, forming a shadow armor.</p><p>But before the deer shadow could fully materialize, the flames arrived.</p><p>Xia Hou made a move to retreat, watching helplessly as the deer shadow was instantly dyed crimson, melting and shattering in the intense heat; the fragments were then swept away by the flames, annihilated in the fiery tongue.</p><p>The Nanming Lihuo, with its overwhelming power, swallowed Xia Hou whole under its terrified gaze!</p><p>Xia Hou's eyes were bloodshot, feeling an overwhelmingly powerful force slamming into it.  With a shrill cry, it was sent flying, the blood spurting from its mouth instantly evaporated by the flames.</p><p>When the flames exploded, a bolt of blue lightning shot out from the heart of the flames, seemingly fleeing in terror, or perhaps knocked back by the force of the explosion, and slammed directly into the palace wall.</p><p>With a *thud*, a figure was revealed in the blue light, pressed flat against the wall in a sprawling ‘X’ shape.</p><p>The palace walls were incredibly strong; they didn't even crack.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang.  He was covered in scorch marks, and his Hui Feng armor was gone.</p><p>This precious armor had endured Xia Hou's fierce attacks and the engulfing flames, completely destroyed and reduced to nothing.</p><p>Not even a fragment remained.</p><p>Before this battle, Qin Sang and Master Qi had discussed this many times; Master Qi had racked his brains to improve the Hui Feng armor, determined to fuse the True Treasure fragment into it to create a truly superior armor.</p><p>The armor, painstakingly crafted by Master Qi with countless hours of effort, was destroyed in this battle!</p><p>Fortunately, as Qin Sang retreated, a canvas-like object fell, the True Treasure fragment.</p><p>The True Treasure fragment was still there, caught in the flames, fluttering like a butterfly in the fire.</p><p>"Cough!"</p><p>Qin Sang slid to the ground, spitting blood, his breath ragged.</p><p>His chest was caved in, revealing a gaping wound. He felt his internal organs displaced, severely injured.</p><p>Qin Sang had held on until the very last moment before the Nanming Lihuo erupted, then released his hold.</p><p>Although the young Suzaku spirit could slightly guide the direction of the Nanming Lihuo's explosion, and although everything was under his control, and the timing was perfect, he still couldn't avoid injury.</p><p>Qin Sang, ignoring his own injuries, fixed his gaze on the heart of the flames.  He assessed the power of the Nine Birds attack based on his own strength.  The instant the Nine Birds merged and unleashed their combined power, he restrained Xia Hou nearby, ensuring at least a grievous injury!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Points of jade light appeared before Qin Sang – a collection of jade vials.</p><p>'Crack, crack, crack…'</p><p>The vials shattered simultaneously. Qin Sang inhaled some of the floral essence within, while most dissipated into nothingness.  The poison, which others feared like a tiger, became a restorative medicine for Qin Sang, rapidly replenishing his energy.</p><p>He gasped for breath, his eyes slightly narrowed.  Through his divine eye technique, the scene within the inferno was reflected in his mind. He saw the black deer within the fiery sea, similarly thrown against the far wall, battered and bruised.</p><p>"It's still alive!"</p><p>He expected as much;  a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. Qin Sang remained calm, not rushing to heal himself. His fingers danced across the air like a musician playing a zither.</p><p>The invisible poison he had secretly released earlier, during his struggle with Xia Hou, had been subtly introduced into Xia Hou's body.  It lay dormant.</p><p>With Qin Sang's movements, runes materialized between his fingers, merging with the toxin. A faint green light flashed, then vanished.  Within the green light was a green square seal, which became invisible and disappeared instantly.  Then, a strange power spread.</p><p>This was a toxic power from the *Poison God Scripture*, called the Annihilation Toxin Domain.</p><p>The Annihilation Toxin Domain, combined with the invisible poison refined from the floral essence, remained hidden until now, finally revealing its fangs!</p><p>Xia Hou crashed against the wall, agonizing pain racking its body.  The injuries to its chest and abdomen were worse than Qin Sang's – its fur was scorched away, revealing bloody viscera, narrowly avoiding being pierced by the South Bright 離 fire.</p><p>The remaining blood desperately flowed towards its inner organs to resist the burning.</p><p>Terror filled Xia Hou's heart. After entering the Cave Xuan realm, it had suffered serious injuries before, but this was the first time it was critically wounded after using its innate divine ability.</p><p>Worse yet, the new injuries triggered old ones, and waves of weakness washed over it.  It was in unprecedented danger!</p><p>Xia Hou desperately channeled its innate divine ability to suppress its injuries. Then, a numbness spread through its body.</p><p>"What is…"</p><p>Even in this crisis, Xia Hou remained alert, instantly recognizing the poison spreading through its body.</p><p>"Poison!"</p><p>Xia Hou was shocked.</p><p>Normally, it could suppress internal poisons, but now, it was a devastating blow.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang, having deployed the Annihilation Toxin Domain, stood up. He then heard an incredibly sharp roar, his gaze hardening.</p><p>Xia Hou reared its head and let out a howl, its crippled body radiating an incredibly powerful aura, filled with determination and a death wish.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. The Annihilation Toxin Domain's function seemed to falter. He then saw black and white energy surging from Xia Hou, growing stronger and stronger.</p><p>At the same time, the blood in Xia Hou's body burned rapidly, and its roar became sharper.</p><p>Its old wounds were reactivated, but Xia Hou ignored it.  Its eyes were bloodshot, filled with boundless hatred.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The black and white energy shot into the air, like two giant serpents, one black, one white, directly targeting Qin Sang.</p><p>Xia Hou merged with the two energies, its blood burning, its life force weakening, yet the black and white energy becoming stronger.  This was its final, desperate counterattack, a headlong rush towards death!</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed, preparing to dodge and defend.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the black and white energy, mid-flight, changed course, charging toward the palace gate at an even faster speed.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.  He had used almost all his resources, finally cornering Xia Hou – he couldn't let it escape!</p><p>The two black dragons outside the gate might not be able to stop Xia Hou if it fled at full speed.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang ceased evasive maneuvers, flapping his phoenix wings powerfully.  He arrived at the palace gate almost simultaneously with Xia Hou.</p><p>At that moment, a gleam flashed in Xia Hou's eyes, filled with hatred.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A vortex suddenly formed at the center of the black and white energy. Antlers emerged from the vortex, engulfing the black and white energy.  In a flash, it struck Qin Sang, delivering a blow.</p><p>This attack lacked the cold moon-shaped blade, but instead, an overwhelming binding force enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>Xia Hou's life force was completely drained, every ounce of strength expended!</p><p>Following the antler, another object surfaced from the vortex: a pill, half black and half white, its luster pure.</p><p>A demon pill!</p><p>Hei Lu raised its head, spat out the pill, its expression resolute.</p><p>At this point, this was their only chance of victory, even if the cost was immense!</p><p>As the antler was raised and the pill expelled, Xia Hou's energy surged out of the palace, awakening the black dragon.</p><p>The black dragon roared, flew from the palace gate, its body coiled, its massive head aimed at the gate, fixed on Xia Hou.</p><p>If Xia Hou dared to take a step outside, it would unleash a devastating attack.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The antler bound Qin Sang.</p><p>The lightning dimmed, Qin Sang, caught off guard, stiffened.</p><p>The demon pill spun upwards, its rotation seemingly slow, yet it captivated Qin Sang's gaze.</p><p>Sensing Xia Hou's desperate intention, Qin Sang opened his mouth, as if to scream, fear evident on his face.</p><p>The demon pill reflected in his pupils; several cracks appeared on its surface.</p><p>Immediately, an overwhelming aura erupted!</p><p>At that moment, the terror on Qin Sang's face vanished, replaced by his usual composure.</p><p>With practiced ease, he performed a hand seal, flesh sprouting from the wound on his chest; his grievous injury healed at an astonishing rate, his weakened aura surging back.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>An aura surpassing his prime erupted from Qin Sang, and before Xia Hou's shocked and despairing eyes, he punched the empty air.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A sonic boom ripped through the air, the antler violently shook.</p><p>Under the force of that punch, the binding force crumbled.</p><p>Qin Sang broke free, his phoenix wings beating as he calmly retreated.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The demon pill exploded!</p><p>A chaotic torrent of black and white energy swept in all directions.</p><p>The two black dragons guarding the archway were hit first, their heads exploding instantly, their remains swallowed by the energy and disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The dragon image on the palace gate reappeared, slightly dimmer than before.</p><p>According to Xia Hou's plan, the demon pill's self-destruction would eliminate Qin Sang and the two black dragons, allowing its remnant soul to escape.</p><p>How the remnant soul would survive in the altar was a concern for later.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated again and again, his expression grave; the demon pill's explosion surpassed even the combined attack of the nine birds.</p><p>If not for his superior skills, he wouldn't have escaped.</p><p>Facing Xia Hou, Qin Sang never considered capture.</p><p>Killing Xia Hou was possible, but after careful consideration, he deemed it risky.</p><p>Luring Xia Hou into self-destructing the demon pill would destroy all the spoils, but it guaranteed Qin Sang's safety.</p><p>His goal was enlightenment through slaying Xia Hou; the spoils were unimportant.</p><p>As he retreated, a cold glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, a clear sword sound seemingly emanating from within him; he transformed into a sword, radiating a sharp sword intent.</p><p>Outside the palace.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, a small, ethereal deer shadow, filled with shock and resentment, witnessed Qin Sang breaking free from the antler, foreseeing its own demise.</p><p>The next moment, the deer shadow froze, shattering from its brow, dissolving like smoke.</p><p>Xia Hou, was dead.</p><p>The chaos gradually subsided.</p><p>A soft sigh echoed from within the palace.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, surveying the ravaged palace; its formidable structure remained unscathed despite the fierce battle.</p><p>The remnants of the fire burned within the palace, along with the lingering aura of the demon pill.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang turned to the Five Elements Crown on the well platform.</p><p>When unleashing the Nanming Lihuo, Qin Sang deliberately chose a spot near the palace gate, far from the Five Elements Crown. The demon pill's explosion also targeted the gate, with most of its force directed outwards.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown's spirit should be undisturbed.</p><p>He took out a handful of pills, swallowing them whole, then moved to the well platform.</p><p>The Inner Lion Seal had limited duration; he needed to return to his cave for treatment.</p><p>If he couldn't subdue the Five Elements Crown, he would leave it there, returning later.</p><p>Recalling the information from Mo Xingdao, Qin Sang raised his hand, lightly pressing it above the Five Elements Crown, his eyes closed.</p><p>His consciousness touched the Five Elements Crown, and he instantly sensed an incredibly fierce demonic intent.</p><p>This was vastly different from Mo Xingdao's description.</p><p>While the spirit was indeed ferocious, the timely intervention of Hui Guang Saint and Qing Hu Saint, using restrictions to seal the spirit, had allowed them to control the treasure.</p><p>Now, all the restrictions on the Five Elements Crown were gone.</p><p>As the spirit and the demonic soul merged, the spirit grew stronger.</p><p>The previous methods were no longer effective.</p><p>The spirit's consciousness was chaotic and incapable of communication.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered; his immunity to demonic intent was an advantage.  A temporary solution was to actively incorporate his consciousness into the demonic intent, using it as a disguise to appease the spirit, temporarily easing its rejection, and retrieving the treasure.</p><p>Subduing it later would be challenging, requiring careful planning.</p><p>Just as he devised a plan, Qin Sang abruptly turned, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Mo Xingdao, summoned by Qin Sang, regained his senses, looking at him in confusion.</p><p>Unaware of the battle's outcome, he only saw the chaotic cave and Qin Sang alone.</p><p>His sharp mind immediately guessed the truth, his eyes wide with shock.</p><p>"How did Hong Yuzi find us?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Mo Xingdao, his voice low.</p><p>He had left a warning restriction outside; it had been triggered, and only Hong Yuzi could be responsible.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was startled, "I didn't tell him about the Five Elements Crown."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed outside the palace.</p><p>He had confirmed it repeatedly – the mirror was a strange space, and no matter how intense the battle, it wouldn't affect the outside world.</p><p>Qing Hu Saint and Xia Hou were even less likely to leave any trace that could attract Hong Yuzi.</p><p>Perhaps Hong Yuzi was skilled in detection.</p><p>Or perhaps Hong Yuzi already knew something!</p><p></p>
