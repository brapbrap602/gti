Chapter 543 Abandonment


Now comes the main event.

No matter how potent external elixirs are, they are ultimately external.

Only by forming one's own Golden Core can one truly take this step on the path of immortality.

The experiences left by those predecessors, whether true or false, can now be verified.

At this moment, Qin Sang abruptly left his cave dwelling. First, he sent a message to Yun Youzi, informing him of his safety and that he might need to seclude himself for a few more days. Then, he searched the deep mountains and finally found a spiritual vein.

During Core Formation, heaven and earth converge, and wind and clouds gather, drawing in spiritual energy from the world to infuse the body.

Other cultivators invariably seek caves rich in spiritual energy when attempting Core Formation, hoping to increase their chances of success. Qin Sang, fearing he might miss the opportune moment, didn't have time for a thorough search.

Although this cave wasn't as good as his own Spirit Spring Cave, it was still usable. If he truly succeeded in forming the Core, the spiritual energy here would be more than sufficient for the infusion process, without impacting the results.

Qin Sang had already confirmed that there were no powerful demons in this mountain range, so he wasn't afraid that the phenomenon of Core Formation would attract trouble.

The spiritual vein wasn't prominent and its range wasn't large, but the spiritual energy was quite rich.

Qin Sang drove away the demonic beasts in the mountains and seized the best cave on the spiritual vein. For this, he gave a sound thrashing to a peak Mortal Demon stage black bear residing within.

After clearing out the stench from the cave, he set up a protective formation and added a Spirit Gathering Formation.  Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground and circulated his cultivation technique with all his might.

Before long, his Qi Sea was full, restored to its peak.

Within the cave, due to the Spirit Gathering Formation, the spiritual energy was extremely dense.  The moment Qin Sang returned to his peak state, the spiritual energy within the cave suddenly exhibited a peculiar fluctuation.

At the same time, outside the cave, the sun was shining brightly, and the sky was clear.

At this moment, the light above the mountain suddenly dimmed, and dark clouds appeared from nowhere. Then, the wind picked up, quickly turning into a gale, causing the grass and trees to bend and dead leaves to fly.

The birds and beasts nearby were startled by the sudden phenomenon. Sensing the unusual aura, they were terrified and scrambled to escape the mountain.

Around this mountain, in the deep forests, there were many uncivilized wild beasts. By chance, they had developed some intelligence and instinctively absorbed the essence of the sun and moon, beginning their transformation into demonic beasts. They were very sensitive to changes in spiritual energy.

They stood up one by one and looked towards the mountain. Although they didn't understand the reason for this phenomenon, a feeling of envy arose from the depths of their hearts.

It left them scratching their heads, not knowing the cause.

"Eh?"

Qin Sang was unaware of the changes outside. His mind was focused on himself. He suddenly let out a soft exclamation, surprised by this unexpected situation.

After returning to his peak state, he had thought he would need to cultivate in seclusion for a while longer, carefully comprehending, before gaining any insights.

Unexpectedly, the signs of Core Formation appeared immediately.

This feeling was like reaching a natural milestone.

As long as he willed it, he could easily achieve it!

He still remembered the writings of those predecessors mentioning that during Core Formation, one couldn't afford the slightest lapse in concentration.  One needed to carefully comprehend and seize the fleeting opportunity to truly succeed in forming the Core.

Qin Sang didn't know if it was due to the Jade Buddha stabilizing his Dao Heart, or the Condensing Yin and Refining Yang cultivation method, or his profound accumulation, or perhaps a combination of all three.

Core Formation was actually much easier than he had imagined!

Seeing this, Qin Sang didn't hesitate at all. He resolutely eliminated all distracting thoughts, embraced the profound and guarded the one, and charged towards Core Formation!

With this thought, spiritual energy began to swirl madly within his Qi Sea.

Outside the mountain, the changes intensified.

The dark clouds gathered, becoming thicker and more numerous.  At some point, they had enveloped a vast area surrounding the mountain. Within the dark clouds, streaks of silver light flickered, and the rumbling of thunder grew increasingly clear.

A fierce wind howled through the mountains, sending sand and stones flying.

The spiritual energy from the surrounding mountains was drawn towards the location of the cave, forming a faint, visible funnel shape with the cave at its center.

As the celestial phenomenon reached a certain point, the true spectacle of Core Formation was about to appear.

Suddenly, the wind and clouds dispersed, and the lightning vanished.

Cracks appeared on the funnel, and then it shattered, scattering the spiritual energy.

In an instant, the world returned to calm, and the scorching sun shone on the mountain range, dispelling all darkness. The previous phenomenon seemed as if it had never existed.

Inside the cave, Qin Sang clutched his dantian, his face flushed, breathing heavily.  In the depths of his eyes, traces of hesitation and resolve lingered.

"If others knew that someone actually abandoned Core Formation on purpose, they would surely call him a fool, right?"

Qin Sang calmed his breath and muttered to himself.

The Core Formation hadn't failed; it was he who had actively stopped it!

"My spiritual energy hasn't reverted, and the opportunity is still there. I can attempt Core Formation again at any time. Otherwise, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to resist such a great temptation..."

Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly and looked down at his Qi Sea. Fortunately, he had made up his mind quickly enough.  He had forcibly stopped Core Formation at the very first sign, preventing any injury to himself.

The reason he did this was because at the last moment, Qin Sang realized—the hidden injuries in his foundation would negatively affect his Golden Core!

Yun Youzi's master hadn't been wrong.

A damaged foundation indeed didn't hinder Core Formation, as Qin Sang's process had been very smooth.

However, just as he was about to begin forming the Core, Qin Sang suddenly understood that if he formed the Core with a damaged foundation, the resulting Golden Core would also be affected.

He remembered Yun Youzi saying:

The two words, Golden Core.

Gold represents something unbreakable and eternally enduring; Core represents something complete, pure, and without deficiency.

The Golden Core Qin Sang would have formed would have been flawed due to his incomplete foundation and deficient Qi Sea, putting him at a natural disadvantage compared to cultivators of the same realm, just like during the Foundation Establishment stage.

Now, Qin Sang realized that if the damage to his foundation wasn't healed, it would continue to affect him.  Moreover, this influence would grow increasingly significant as his cultivation progressed!

As the saying goes, there are no regrets with the Golden Core.

Once such a flawed Core was formed, trying to mend it would likely be even more difficult than repairing his foundation, and he wasn't certain how effective the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit would be then.

Because of this,

At the last moment, Qin Sang resolutely made a move that would astound countless cultivators, resisting the immense temptation and actively interrupting his Core Formation.

If he hadn't known about the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, he might have hesitated. Now, things were different.  The fruit was in the Purple Star Palace, and he would be able to enter within the next two years.

He had external elixirs, the Flying Night Devil, Void Sky Lightning, magical treasures…

With his abilities, even without forming a Golden Core, he still wasn't afraid of Golden Core cultivators.

Moreover, his apparent cultivation was only at the False Core realm, which might lead others to underestimate him, giving him opportunities to play the underdog.

However, these weren't the primary reasons.

After his spiritual energy had transformed, it was very stable. Core Formation, for Qin Sang, was like ordinary cultivation, a natural progression.

Whenever he willed it, he could form his Core.

As long as he wanted to, he could attempt Core Formation anytime, anywhere.

Even within the Purple Star Palace, which wasn't a barren land of spiritual energy.

Since that was the case, why risk the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit being ineffective and rush these two years?
