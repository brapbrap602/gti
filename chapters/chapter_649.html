<h1>Chapter 641: The Limit of Divine Patterns</h1><p>Chapter 641: The Limit of Divine Patterns</p><p>“A mere Qi Condensation disciple, how many resources could they possibly use? Cultivate them secretly.  Among all the Sacred Maidens of Yi Hui Village, Old Qin chose the mute girl. Perhaps, she will be the link between us and Old Qin.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi gestured for his junior disciple, Tong, to leave.</p><p>The secret room was silent. Cui Xuanzi summoned his life-bound insect, a scorpion the size of his palm.</p><p>The scorpion was pure white, its skin smooth and lustrous, like jade. Its stinger, however, was faint, almost illusory.</p><p>This was the Illusion-Tail Scorpion, one of the five insects that the Five Insects Sect excelled at cultivating.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi gently stroked the Illusion-Tail Scorpion.  In a moment, a smaller Illusion-Tail Scorpion emerged from the larger one’s abdomen, nuzzling his finger affectionately.</p><p>This one was far weaker, only at the peak of its first transformation.</p><p>Looking at the two scorpions, one large and one small, Cui Xuanzi sighed softly.</p><p>Both scorpions were his life-bound insects.</p><p>Years ago, when Cui Xuanzi used the Blood Refinement technique to cultivate his life-bound insects, he discovered that the egg contained twin larvae.</p><p>There are two methods for Blood Refinement of insects.</p><p>One is to use an adult insect. After Blood Refinement, regardless of its previous cultivation level, it will revert to a larva.</p><p>This method has a low success rate because adult insects fiercely resist, and the stronger the insect, the more violent the resistance. Cultivators can only rely on their own strength to suppress the insect; if the insect is stronger, it's impossible to succeed.</p><p>However, it has one advantage: after becoming a life-bound insect, further transformation is easier.</p><p>The second method is to directly use larvae, the choice of most cultivators.</p><p>When using larvae for Blood Refinement, twins or multiple larvae are not uncommon. One must select the strongest and abandon the rest, as one can only have one life-bound insect.</p><p>But Cui Xuanzi, for some unknown reason, inexplicably refined both Illusion-Tail Scorpions into life-bound insects, possessing twin insects.</p><p>This filled him with overwhelming joy.  His talent wasn't exceptional, so having two life-bound insects, though more difficult to cultivate, was equivalent to double the combat power.</p><p>Aware of his unique situation, he never revealed it to others; only his master knew.</p><p>During his Qi Condensation stage, Cui Xuanzi, relying on his two life-bound insects, had extremely high combat power, repeatedly accomplishing great feats, earning him the sect's focused cultivation, and he quickly established his Foundation.</p><p>However, after establishing his Foundation and attempting to enhance his life-bound insects, he discovered that one had successfully transformed, but the other was stagnant, stubbornly refusing to begin its second transformation.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi never gave up, pouring countless resources into it, yet to no avail.</p><p>Finally, he had to admit that this Illusion-Tail Scorpion had completely lost its potential for transformation, perhaps the price of twin insects.</p><p>Now, the second insect was like a useless appendage, increasingly less useful, yet he couldn’t bear to discard it.</p><p>…</p><p>Amidst countless mountains and ravines, where poisonous miasma covered the land and few dared to tread, a figure effortlessly moved through the miasma and jungle, more agile than a bird.</p><p>“This is the place.”</p><p>Qin Sang landed on a rock, gazing at the mountain before him.</p><p>At the mountain’s peak, a ring of clouds formed a barrier, sealing the summit, perpetually undisturbed.</p><p>Legend has it that an ancient temple sits atop the mountain, where one can receive a legacy.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had been away from Xiong Mountain for almost two months, and more than half a year had passed since he first awoke adrift on the water.</p><p>These past two months, Qin Sang had explored the dangerous areas and secret realms near Xiong Mountain.</p><p>Except for one exceptionally dangerous area, which he dared not venture too deeply into.  Regardless of whether the rumors the Five Insects Sect gathered were true or not, Qin Sang investigated them all.</p><p>This mountain was the last.</p><p>He had yet to find any trace of the ancient teleportation array.</p><p>Although Qin Sang hadn't reached the core of that dangerous area, he could tell that the possibility of an ancient teleportation array was minimal.</p><p>It wasn't entirely fruitless; Qin Sang collected several herbs usable by Foundation Establishment cultivators, making the journey worthwhile.</p><p>“This is the last place. If it’s not here, I’ll put it aside for now and search for insects in the heart of the Western Frontier.”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, making his decision.  “I wonder how things are going with the Five Insects Sect? Once I choose my life-bound insect, I'll return to Xiong Mountain and then leave the Western Frontier. Cultivating while searching for information about Senior Qingzhu is not a bad plan.  Senior Qingzhu has such high talent, far surpassing Hao Yue, there shouldn't be absolutely no trace of them.”</p><p>Qin Sang leaped, like an eagle taking flight, soaring towards the opposite mountain peak.</p><p>It seemed to be a unique restriction of the Wu tribe. If only I knew Wu tribal runes, breaking these cloud barriers would be much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in mid-air, staring at the cloud ring, pondering a solution.</p><p>He now understood the Wu tribe very well, and his doubts about the runes were finally resolved.</p><p>The power of Wu cultivator runes was only slightly stronger than peak Qi Condensation-stage spells, useful only in the Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment stages.  Beyond that, they were completely useless.</p><p>And utterly so!</p><p>Countless brilliant Wu practitioners, throughout history, had devoted their lives to researching runes, trying to find a way forward, to reconstruct the Wu rune path. Even Nascent Soul masters had failed.</p><p>Wu cultivators past the Foundation Establishment stage had to abandon runes.</p><p>Even the sect disciples, believing in their bright futures, didn't cultivate runes during the Qi Condensation stage to avoid wasting time.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously felt that runes, as a unique power of the Wu tribe, were extremely compatible with their bloodline, perhaps even more orthodox than their spirit insects.</p><p>Now it seemed many Wu ancestors had similar thoughts.</p><p>Alas, the path was cut off.</p><p>Summoning the Flying Sky Rakshasa for protection, Qin Sang took out the Ten Directions Yama Banner.  Forming a three-banner array, he gathered Nine Netherworld fire into a fireball and launched it at the cloud ring.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black flames surged into the cloud ring, like a drop of ink on white paper, quickly spreading.</p><p>The cloud ring fluctuated. Where the Nine Netherworld fire struck, the clouds rapidly dissipated, becoming extremely thin.</p><p>The Flying Sky Rakshasa and Qin Sang broke through the clouds, and clearly saw the ancient temple on the mountaintop, bathed in sunlight, gleaming golden.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang shook his head as he left the temple.</p><p>This place had been visited countless times; treasures had long been looted, leaving it completely empty.</p><p>Another fruitless search. Qin Sang officially entered the heart of Western Xinjiang, embarking on his insect-hunting journey.</p><p>…</p><p>A month later.</p><p>In a vast wasteland, the wild grass was as tall as a man.</p><p>Qin Sang held a geographical map, having searched the wasteland for several days, seeking the entrance to an underground cavern.</p><p>The map only roughly marked the spirit insect nests.  Often, it simply indicated a general area where such insects had been seen, not the nest itself.</p><p>Add to that the passage of time and changes in terrain, and finding the exact location required considerable effort.</p>
