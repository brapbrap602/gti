<h1>Chapter 536: A Shocking Revelation</h1><p>Wu Youdao didn't believe a word of Qin Sang's explanation, furiously shouting, "Coward! You not only trespassed into my sect's territory but dared to kill my disciple right in front of me! I will not let you escape!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "If you were in my position, Fellow Daoist Wu, would you surrender willingly? Besides, Wen Yanjie and I have a long-standing feud. I simply haven't had the time to deal with him until now. If you investigate, you'll find out what kind of person he was. I've done your sect a favor by eliminating him before he could bring disaster upon the Azure Yang Sect."</p><p>"More lies!"</p><p>Wu Youdao was enraged, yet a seed of doubt was planted in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang had stated Wen Yanjie's full name without hesitation, and his tone didn't sound like a lie.</p><p>Could they really have had prior interactions?</p><p>A Core Formation cultivator and a Foundation Establishment cultivator were worlds apart. Unless Wen Yanjie had been exceptionally foolish and provoked Qin Sang, why would a Golden Core cultivator even notice him?</p><p>Despite his thoughts, Wu Youdao's attacks intensified.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted. "It seems we're destined for a fight today, Fellow Daoist Wu. Let's see if you have what it takes to keep me here!"</p><p>Wu Youdao wasn't a seasoned Golden Core cultivator. His two magical treasures were inherited from his Azure Yang Devil Sect predecessors.  Some cultivators who achieved Golden Core around the same time as him were still painstakingly gathering resources to refine their own life-bound treasures.</p><p>Having fought for so long, Qin Sang had a good grasp of Wu Youdao's life-bound treasure. Unless Wu Youdao had other hidden techniques, Qin Sang was confident he wouldn't be overwhelmed before his true essence was depleted.  He even managed to learn a few fire manipulation techniques from Wu Youdao during the fight.</p><p>The Ten Yama Banners swelled to several meters tall, standing erect before Qin Sang. As the banners danced, the Nine Nether Devil Fire covered half the sky.</p><p>The other half was filled with Wu Youdao's Azure Yang Devil Fire.</p><p>Within the two-colored sea of fire, black and azure flames clashed and collided.</p><p>Waves of fire surged, piling up into a massive, two-colored volcano in the center.</p><p>The aura of the devil fire swept across the land, sending birds and beasts fleeing.</p><p>…</p><p>Azure Yang Devil Sect.</p><p>Li Qing emerged from the forbidden grounds and flew toward Divine罡 Peak.</p><p>His eyes held a hint of confusion.</p><p>Back at Divine罡 Peak, Li Qing saw his fellow disciples gathered around the swirling vortex, but none were attempting a rescue. He scanned the crowd, located an elder, and asked, "Senior Brother Ji, why haven't we rescued them yet?"</p><p>"Junior Brother Li, you're back," the elder surnamed Ji hurried over, asking with concern, "What's the situation in the forbidden grounds? What treasures were stolen?"</p><p>Li Qing hesitated. "I followed Elder Wu's instructions and thoroughly checked every corner of the forbidden grounds. There's no sign of intrusion, and all the important areas and treasures are intact. There's not even any indication that the protective formations were breached."</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Ji was also surprised. He glanced at the swirling vortex. "I've sent disciples to patrol everywhere, and they haven't found anything unusual either. A Golden Core expert sneaking in just for a piece of罡 Jade? He could have simply asked Elder Wu directly, and he likely wouldn't have been refused. Why go through all this trouble and risk exposure?"</p><p>"Not necessarily!"</p><p>Li Qing shook his head. "A while ago, I overheard the Sect Master mentioning to Elder Wu that the Ancestral Holy Fire will soon enter another dormant period. When it awakens, it will be harder to appease and require even more 罡 Jade.  Our cultivators above the pseudo-Core Formation stage need to absorb the pure罡 Qi from the 罡 Jade to refine our devil fire.  With increasing demand and diminishing supply, sooner or later, we won't be able to control the Ancestral Holy Fire."</p><p>Elder Ji sighed. "Our ancestors left the Holy Fire to protect future generations. Who could have imagined it would become such a threat one day?"</p><p>As they spoke, a scream suddenly echoed from nearby.</p><p>The swirling vortex abruptly expanded, doubling in size. The lightning within crackled and danced, its power surging.</p><p>The surrounding disciples were nearly pulled into the vortex and quickly retreated.</p><p>The two elders rushed over to examine it. Seeing the vortex stabilize, they both breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Elder Ji said gravely, "Our two junior brothers have been trapped for too long. The wind and thunder energy outside the vortex has accumulated to a terrifying level.  Fortunately, the Ancestral Holy Fire at the center hasn't lost control yet, otherwise, they would be in grave danger. We dare not use the Azure Fire Banner Formation to force a breakthrough. We can't control the power of the flames and might harm them instead. Only Elder Wu can save them.  Moreover, if we delay any longer, it might trigger a chain reaction. If other 罡 Jade shatter under the pressure, the consequences will be disastrous!"</p><p>Li Qing trusted Elder Ji's judgment. "Immediately repair the flying ship and gather the disciples with Azure Banners..."</p><p>Elder Ji glanced at Li Qing and pondered. "Junior Brother Li, in my opinion, we should inform Elder Wu of the situation within the sect before making any decisions."</p><p>Li Qing frowned. "What do you mean, Senior Brother Ji?"</p><p>Elder Ji transmitted his voice. "Junior Brother Li, I just sent a few disciples to assist Junior Brother Yang in repairing the flying ship, but they reported back that the damage is severe and it can't be fixed quickly."</p><p>Li Qing snorted, his expression darkening.</p><p>Elder Ji waved his hand. "The scene of Junior Brother Wen's head exploding, his blood splattering across the sky, was indeed a traumatic experience. I still shudder when I think about it, so we can't blame them. But that's not my main point. Junior Brother Li, think about it, if someone stole a valuable treasure from the forbidden grounds, we would naturally pursue them relentlessly, even using the entire sect's strength to eliminate them. But now we know that the only loss is a small piece of罡 Jade..."</p><p>Elder Ji paused, observing Li Qing's thoughtful expression. He continued, "Of course, whether to kill or release him is Elder Wu's decision. We still need to make the necessary preparations. That's why I suggest you inform Elder Wu first.  Knowing the full situation will allow him to make an informed decision."</p><p>After speaking, Elder Ji stepped aside and instructed the others to check the surrounding 罡 Jade for any abnormalities.</p><p>Li Qing pondered for a moment, then turned and descended the mountain alone.</p><p>…</p><p>Wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Youdao's battle raged on.</p><p>The Ten Yama Banners and the Fire Gourd clashed relentlessly.</p><p>Their battlefield had shifted across a dozen mountain peaks, leaving behind a trail of scorched earth.</p><p>Qin Sang was getting exasperated.</p><p>No matter what he said, Wu Youdao seemed to ignore him completely, showing no signs of stopping.  He wondered if Wu Youdao had figured something out.</p><p>As he fought, Qin Sang carefully calculated his remaining true essence, estimating he could hold on for another half an hour.</p><p>If he couldn't force Wu Youdao to retreat within that time, he would have to consider using the Void Thunder.</p><p>He only had one chance.</p>
