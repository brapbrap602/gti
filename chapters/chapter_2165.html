<h1>Chapter 2155: Saint Realm Savage Beast</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, this is King Qi.”</p><p>Qin Sang was currently a guest in Supreme Sovereign’s courtyard.</p><p>Supreme Sovereign had invited a member of the Si You Clan. This person possessed exquisite beauty, a somewhat androgynous aura, meticulous attire, and a kingly demeanor.</p><p>King Qi was indeed one of the former Four Kings.</p><p>Qin Sang rose and bowed with clasped hands.</p><p>King Qi also solemnly returned the gesture, his voice as soft as a woman’s. “This King has long admired Fellow Daoist Qin’s great name, but reputation truly pales in comparison to meeting in person. Supreme Sovereign’s ability to recruit Fellow Daoist Qin is like adding wings to a tiger, and a great reinforcement for our Si You Clan. Therefore, upon receiving Supreme Sovereign’s invitation, this King did not hesitate long before accepting!”</p><p>“Many thanks to King Qi for your regard. This humble Daoist only has the opportunity to enter the Sacred Land because of you,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>After an exchange of pleasantries, they took their seats according to host and guest. Subsequently, more people arrived one after another, all members of the Si You Clan. They were either of high cultivation or esteemed status, each a lord in their own right.</p><p>Grand Preceptor also arrived and sat beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Immortal nectar and fruits filled the courtyard with a wondrous fragrance.</p><p>At the banquet, Supreme Sovereign and Qin Sang became the center of attention. Executing Grand Preceptor Zhu, annihilating the Lu Family, and avenging Si Lu—each of these were earth-shattering events within the Si You Clan.</p><p>To avoid suspicion, Qin Sang had returned to Qing Yang Province after the Lu Manor’s fall. Many who wished to visit him were unable to, only seeing him in person today.</p><p>The fact proved that Qin Sang had formed an alliance with Supreme Sovereign, providing yet another reason for them to cultivate a relationship with Qin Sang.</p><p>The banquet concluded.</p><p>Both host and guests were thoroughly pleased, and the conversation turned to the main topic.</p><p>The guests at the banquet, excluding Qin Sang, were all masters of Mirage Shells.  These individuals each brought forth their own Mirage Shells.</p><p>Spiritual light bloomed from the precious jades, the brilliance pure and clear, inspiring reverence.  Under the radiant glow, the scenery of the courtyard became even more beautiful.</p><p>Everyone performed incantations, each drawing a wisp of Qin Sang’s aura and infusing it into their Mirage Shells.</p><p>New, archaic patterns surfaced on the surface of the Mirage Shells, then quickly vanished.  The wisp of aura had been imprinted within.</p><p>The completion of this act signified that Qin Sang had obtained the recognition of all the Mirage Shell masters of the Si You Clan.  Without requiring any further action from Qin Sang, he would be able to easily pass through the gates of the Sacred Land.</p><p>Everyone rose and took their leave. Qin Sang also departed with Grand Preceptor, arriving at the latter’s palace.</p><p>He had already made preparations to enter the Sacred Land. During the period before its opening, he would remain here and enter the Sacred Land as Grand Preceptor’s attendant.</p><p>Within Yuan Jiao Sea Market, those Otherfolk experts comparable to late Void Refinement stage cultivators were the true focus of attention. Qin Sang outwardly displayed only mid Void Refinement cultivation. No one would delve into his origins.  Disguised as a member of the royal family, he needn't worry about exposing any flaws.</p><p>The next day, the cultivators in Yuan Jiao Sea Market noticed subtle changes in the celestial phenomena. The originally bright sunlight dimmed slightly, as if a haze had veiled the sky.</p><p>Aside from this, there were no other effects. But on the second day, the haze deepened.  In the following days, the sky grew increasingly dark, the haze gradually transforming into heavy, gloomy clouds.</p><p>Dark clouds gathered, and fierce winds began to rage.</p><p>The cultivators in Yuan Jiao Sea Market were all of high cultivation and unaffected by the celestial changes, yet they all realized that the Sacred Land was about to open!</p><p>The opening of the Sacred Land meant that Yuan Jiao Sea Market was nearing its end. Those cultivators without the qualifications to enter the Sacred Land began to pack their belongings, preparing to leave.</p><p>Early one morning…</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A bolt of lightning out of the blue shook the entire Yuan Jiao Sea Market.</p><p>Streaks of light immediately appeared in the sky above the Sea Market. More and more people flew out of their caves, gazing upwards.</p><p>Within the depths of the dark clouds, a golden light was dissipating.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Another clap of thunder followed closely, and a golden lightning bolt pierced the cloud layer like a majestic golden dragon, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws as it tore apart the dark clouds.</p><p>*Crack…Rumble…*</p><p>Endless golden lightning bolts radiated astonishing might, causing even the islands protected by formations to tremble.</p><p>The dark clouds were split and scattered by the lightning. The cultivators circulated their spirit eyes, peering through the gaps to witness a different scene above the clouds, as if two worlds existed.</p><p>There, rosy clouds filled the sky, auspicious rays of light streamed down, and immortal mountains, jade trees, and celestial flowers were interspersed amongst white clouds. Divine beings, celestial children, auspicious beasts, and spiritual birds traversed the celestial realm, carefree and at ease.</p><p>Unfortunately, this was not a true celestial realm but a beautiful illusion. The illusion constantly shifted, the only constant being a mass of golden lightning forming a golden light.</p><p>Rumbling thunder continuously emanated from within the golden light, and lightning flashed incessantly, the source of the world's tremors.</p><p>Suddenly, with a *boom*, a thick bolt of golden lightning erupted from the center of the golden light.</p><p>At this moment, everyone's eyes felt a sharp sting as they watched in astonishment. Wherever the golden lightning passed, cracks appeared in the illusory celestial realm, as if the barrier connecting the two spaces had been shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyelids twitched involuntarily. He couldn't imagine the consequences of being struck by this lightning bolt!</p><p>In an instant, dazzling golden light filled the sky.</p><p>The dark clouds dispersed, golden light bathed every spirit island and every person.  Bolts of golden lightning, each possessing world-destroying power, shot out from the fissure in the void.</p><p>The golden light there was incredibly blinding.  Only a few could see clearly that a gigantic golden gate had appeared at its center.</p><p>Lightning crackled around the golden gate, which stood tall in the void, exuding an earth-shattering aura. It resembled an immortal gate leading to a mysterious celestial realm, yet within the gate was only a chaotic mass of golden clouds.</p><p>Before the celestial phenomena could subside, several streaks of light shot out from Yuan Jiao Sea Market, heading straight for the golden gate.</p><p>These figures passed through the gaps between the lightning bolts, entering the golden gate unharmed, and then vanished from everyone's sight.</p><p>Witnessing this, the cultivators of the various tribes began to stir.</p><p>Grand Preceptor transmitted his voice, “Fellow Daoist Qin, the sooner the better.”</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze to the distance, seeing Su Nu, Li Yufu, and Yu Nu. He then looked towards the Zhu Yan Clan’s formation; Liao Chen and Liu Li were disguised, standing beside the Yuan Xiang Clan Leader.</p><p>He withdrew his gaze and nodded to Grand Preceptor. The two immediately soared into the air, flying towards the golden gate together.</p><p>The golden gate was far larger than it appeared from below.  As they approached, the golden clouds behind the gate resembled a devouring vortex.  Qin Sang’s mind tensed slightly as he followed Grand Preceptor through the golden gate.</p><p>In the instant he passed through the gate, Qin Sang focused his senses, yet he didn't detect any fluctuations, nor any sense of being probed or observed.  He passed through smoothly, his figure disappearing into the golden clouds.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt himself enveloped by a chaotic mass of clouds. There was a power here even more chaotic than the River of Misfortune, as if heaven and earth were inverted.</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…”</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>A wave of dizziness washed over him. The Mirage Shell in Grand Preceptor's hand flew out on its own, emitting a white light that enveloped them, carrying them towards a certain point within the golden clouds.</p><p>Beside a certain lake.</p><p>The lake water here was clear, and aquatic plants flourished. Though it was a fertile land, it was incredibly quiet, without a single bird or beast in sight.</p><p>On the lakeshore, between two mountains, a valley formed, wide at the entrance and narrow within. The entrance to the valley was sealed by a multicolored miasma.</p><p>Within the miasma, strange figures could be vaguely seen wandering.</p><p>Suddenly, the tranquility here was shattered.</p><p>Without any warning, a hurricane swept across the land, instantly darkening the sky. Aquatic plants were uprooted by the violent winds and tossed into the air, dancing wildly like scattered cotton.</p><p>The miasma also churned violently in the gale, as if it might be blown away at any moment.</p><p>“Screech…”</p><p>Sharp, strange cries emanated from the valley, carrying notes of unease and rage.  Dense figures suddenly appeared within the miasma.</p><p>Just then, a clap of thunder sounded from high above, and a void suddenly appeared.  Golden light flickered within the void. In a flash, the void closed, the golden light vanished, and two figures tumbled out.</p><p>They appeared slightly disoriented at first, but quickly steadied themselves, looking around.  They were Grand Preceptor and Qin Sang. They had indeed landed in the same place, without being separated.</p><p>After the void disappeared, the hurricane began to weaken, but the damage it had inflicted on the area was irreversible. The beautiful scenery was completely destroyed, leaving behind a scene of devastation.</p><p>“This place…”</p><p>Grand Preceptor started to speak, but was suddenly interrupted by a series of shrieks.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted towards the valley, and he saw the miasma writhing as a group of monsters charged out.</p><p>These monsters had scorpion tails and scorpion bodies, but their upper bodies were humanoid, with human-like heads.  However, they lacked human facial features, their appearances bizarre and hideous.</p><p>They were incredibly fast, moving like the wind. Clouds of miasma billowed beneath them as they shrieked and charged towards Qin Sang and Grand Preceptor, as if they had identified them as the destroyers of their home.</p><p>These monstrous beasts were ferocious and malevolent. The aura they exuded held a fierce and sinister quality familiar to Qin Sang. They seemed to possess some human characteristics, but they were not Otherfolk, but Savage Beasts!</p><p>“Savage Beasts?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept over these scorpion-bodied monsters, recognizing them as Savage Beasts, yet different from those inhabiting the River of Misfortune.</p><p>The sinister aura they exuded wasn't as intense. They hadn't completely lost their reason, which allowed them to reproduce and inhabit this nest in the absence of external enemies.</p><p>However, this sinister nature seemed to be etched into their very souls, impossible to erase. Thus, their intelligence was limited, and once they perceived an enemy, the sinister nature would gradually be stimulated, ultimately driving them into a frenzy, causing them to lose all reason and fight to the death!</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had already sensed the beginnings of this process.</p><p>A scorpion-bodied monster, clearly the leader, was the fastest. It had already reached a point ten zhang* away from them.  The miasma carried a pungent, foul odor that made one want to retch.</p><p>*A zhang is approximately 3.33 meters.</p><p>Qin Sang's fingers twitched slightly.  Worldly spiritual energy vibrated, transforming into a series of invisible spirit swords that hung gleaming in midair.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The strongest of these scorpion-bodied monsters were no more powerful than Nascent Soul cultivators. They were no match for Qin Sang at all, and all perished.</p><p>Their blood was the same color as the miasma. The stench of blood overwhelmed the miasma, and more urgent, enraged cries echoed from the valley as the leader of the scorpion-bodied monsters charged out with its entire tribe, their eyes bloodshot with unrestrained ferocity.</p><p>In the eyes of cultivators from the Great Thousand Worlds, Savage Beasts without intelligence weren't considered living beings.  Qin Sang showed no mercy.  Sword shadows flickered, leaving a large swathe of corpses by the lake.</p><p>His divine sense probed into the valley, sweeping through the scorpion-bodied monsters' nest. Qin Sang let out a soft gasp.</p><p>He reached out and grasped at the air.  The miasma at the valley entrance parted to the sides, and a mass of deep blue light flew out, revealing a spiritual flower within.</p><p>The spiritual flower had broad, overlapping leaves, and nestled amidst them was a blue blossom shaped like a phoenix about to take flight, its surface even bearing feather-like markings.</p><p>“Is this a Blue Phoenix Flower?”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>This was certainly an unexpected delight. The Blue Phoenix Flower was a rare spiritual herb, extremely valuable in the outside world, yet he had found one in the nest of a group of scorpion-bodied monsters.</p><p>Grand Preceptor glanced at it and said, “It seems these scorpion-bodied monsters were quite fortunate. There must not be any stronger Savage Beasts in the vicinity for them to have claimed this spiritual flower. Since Fellow Daoist Qin eliminated these monsters, you should keep the flower.”</p><p>Seeing Grand Preceptor's nonchalant attitude, Qin Sang realized that the Sacred Land was indeed a land of treasures.  Spiritual herbs rare in the outside world were not exactly ubiquitous here, but they were certainly not uncommon.</p><p>He unhesitatingly collected the Blue Phoenix Flower and carefully surveyed the surroundings, finding no distinguishing features. He couldn’t determine their exact location based on the surrounding scenery alone.</p><p>“Our priority is to determine our location.  The situation here is unclear, and we shouldn’t separate.  Let’s travel together for a while until we’ve confirmed there’s no danger, and then we can search separately,” Grand Preceptor suggested.</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections. The two erased the traces below and chose a random direction.</p><p>After flying for some time, they encountered another group of Savage Beasts.  Grand Preceptor dealt with them, but they didn't find any spiritual herbs comparable to the Blue Phoenix Flower in their nest.</p><p>They discovered that this area was filled with mountains and lakes. Numerous lakes were scattered among the mountains like pearls strewn across the earth.</p><p>“According to the records, there are several areas with this kind of terrain: the southern part of Myriad Spirits Lake, the area around Rootless Island, the western foothills of Hundred-Foot Divine Mountain…”</p><p>Grand Preceptor said softly, “If we’re near Rootless Island, we’ll reach our agreed-upon meeting place soon.”</p><p>As he spoke, they suddenly halted their flight, exchanging glances and looking towards the east. Just now, they had sensed two powerful auras approaching rapidly.</p><p>These were not the auras of Savage Beasts.  The newcomers must be Otherfolk cultivators!</p><p>They hadn't expected to encounter others so soon.</p><p>The streaks of light hadn't yet appeared in their field of vision, but they were both acutely aware.  As the two auras drew closer, Qin Sang felt a faint sense of familiarity.</p><p>“Brother Qin, do you recognize them?” Grand Preceptor asked.</p><p>Qin Sang said thoughtfully, “Perhaps an old acquaintance.”</p><p>As they drew closer, Qin Sang became almost seventy percent certain that one of them was the Quan Feng clansman he had fought when rescuing Si Lu.</p><p>Back then, he had severely injured this person, shattering their body and forcing them to abandon their physical form, with only a miniature figure within their ear escaping with their life.  Unexpectedly, not only had their injuries healed, but their cultivation had also improved considerably.</p><p>“Quan Feng Clan? Since they’re from the Water Division, let's keep them here!”</p><p>Grand Preceptor sneered, but then both he and Qin Sang sensed something amiss.</p><p>As the other party flew, their aura was practically unconcealed. Based on Qin Sang’s judgment, this speed was almost the limit for that Quan Feng clansman, and they seemed somewhat panicked.</p><p>Were they intentionally attracting Savage Beasts, or were they too preoccupied to consider such things?</p><p>Immediately afterwards, Qin Sang and Grand Preceptor vaguely sensed a powerful pressure emanating from the distant east.  Despite the distance, the instant they sensed this pressure, their minds tensed, and a feeling of dread washed over them.</p><p>“Saint Realm Savage Beast!”</p><p>Grand Preceptor’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face also turned grim. “Weren’t we told that we typically wouldn’t encounter Body Integration stage Savage Beasts right after entering the Sacred Land?”</p>
