<h1>Chapter 894: The Storm Begins</h1><p>After the others entered the stone hall, the disguised Zhang Yue arrived at the foot of the mountain. He waited for a while, and saw two figures flying from afar – Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao.</p><p>“Junior Brother Zhang, sorry to keep you waiting.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao cupped his hands, his expression somewhat tense.</p><p>Zhang Yue led the two and turned to fly inside. Unexpectedly, just as they reached the mountainside, a flash of green light landed in front of the three, revealing a somewhat short and stout man.</p><p>“Ah! Greetings, Senior Uncle!”</p><p>Zhang Yue feigned surprise and hurriedly bowed.</p><p>The stout man was a cultivator from the Azure Flood Sect who had come with them. His cultivation was slightly higher than the Dao Child's.  Zhang Yue only knew he was a True Disciple of the Five Elements lineage and didn't know his name.</p><p>“Is he the disciple Elder Huayang brought in? Who are these people, and why are you bringing them in?” The stout man raised his chin and asked with a frown.</p><p>This person seemed to recognize Zhang Yue.</p><p>Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao stood stiffly.</p><p>Zhang Yue's thoughts raced, and he replied, “Senior Uncle, they are disciples of Senior Chen from the Misty Pavilion. She is Fang Ting, Senior Chen's direct disciple, and a friend of mine. She came to find me.”</p><p>“Fang Ting?”</p><p>The stout cultivator seemed to recall something. He sized Fang Ting up, his eyes darting around, and a playful smile suddenly appeared on his face. “I’ve long heard that what Elder Huayang couldn’t accomplish might be achieved by a Qi Refinement junior, haha…”</p><p>“Good luck!”</p><p>The stout cultivator patted Zhang Yue’s shoulder with an ambiguous smile, then flashed away.</p><p>Zhang Yue was taken aback. He understood the hidden meaning in the stout man’s words and subconsciously looked at Fang Ting. He saw Fang Ting’s head almost buried in her chest, her ears like red gems.</p><p>“Ahem…”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao coughed lightly and said, “Junior Brother, Junior Sister, shouldn’t we be going?”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Clarity Island, a shadow loomed over the water's surface.</p><p>Several figures sat cross-legged within the shadow, one of whom was the young man surnamed Fang who had previously tricked Qin Sang.</p><p>“Senior Brother, the time is almost upon us. With Clarity Island’s emergence, the grand formation's power has greatly diminished. It's time to move. If we wait any longer, more and more Nascent Soul old fogies from various sects will arrive, and things will become difficult.”</p><p>A black-robed man opened his eyes and said in a deep voice.</p><p>At this time, another gloomy-faced middle-aged cultivator asked, “Second Senior Brother, how is the mole you planted inside?  If we need to use him, make sure there are no slip-ups.”</p><p>“Rest assured! He will be ready before us.”</p><p>The black-robed man said confidently.</p><p>“That’s good. That thing really is on Clarity Island.  Knowing that, we shouldn’t have bothered with those Bullfighting Peak outcasts! That damned human not only killed Fourth Senior Brother, but also spread the news all over Heavenly Ascent Island, ruining Fourth Senior Brother’s plans there. The human experts he had recruited became wary, and we had to abandon the plan. If we had brought them directly to attack Clarity Island with our strength, we would have had a good chance of forcing our way onto the island and seizing that thing.”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator said indignantly.</p><p>“Are you saying I made a mistake?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze filled with killing intent, coldly staring at the middle-aged cultivator.</p><p>“This disciple wouldn’t dare. It’s just that I hate the murderer who killed Fourth Senior Brother and Junior Brother so much that I spoke out of turn…”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator shuddered, terrified, and hurriedly knelt, explaining repeatedly.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother was just careless. He's always been impulsive. Senior Brother, don’t mind him. That human cultivator is just a small Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator. He has repeatedly offended our Black Serpent Mountain. Sooner or later, we’ll extract his soul and incinerate it with Yin Fire day and night, settling every score with him!”</p><p>The black-robed man quickly smoothed things over, then pointed at the middle-aged cultivator and reprimanded, “What do you know?  Without capturing the Bullfighting Peak remnants, how could we confirm that the item is on Clarity Island? Moreover, Senior Brother has always been wary of the other Nascent Soul ancestor of the Azure Flood Sect and didn’t dare to act rashly. It was from the Bullfighting Peak remnants that we learned that person was the ancestor of the Bullfighting Peak lineage, and the turmoil back then was caused by him, leading to internal strife within the Azure Flood Sect and severely weakening them. Not only was the Bullfighting Peak lineage expelled, but that Nascent Soul ancestor also fell due to his injuries. It’s hateful that the Azure Flood Sect has been concealing the news, claiming that he was merely in seclusion.”</p><p>A dwarf, only half the size of an adult, suddenly let out a strange laugh. “It’s no wonder the Azure Flood Sect has been keeping this matter under wraps. Not to mention it involves the death of a Nascent Soul ancestor. While the Bullfighting Peak cultivation method is ordinary, the 'Commanding Thunder Technique' that complements it is truly ingenious and quite extraordinary. If the Azure Flood Sect could secretly cultivate a group of cultivators proficient in this Dao technique, they would be a devastating force.”</p><p>“No matter how ingenious a Dao technique is, if it cannot be cultivated, it’s no different from waste paper. Isn’t the Azure Flood Sect’s current state due to this incident?”</p><p>The black-robed man said disdainfully, his brow slightly furrowed. “Tenth Junior Brother, I remember you kept a copy of the 'Commanding Thunder Technique'. Do you also want to cultivate it? Be careful not to become a madman!”</p><p>The dwarf gave a dry laugh. “I don't want to be like them, living in fear every day and hiding in a seabed cave like a profound ice coffin. I kept this Dao technique to study it and see if there’s anything I can learn from it.”</p><p>The black-robed man’s expression softened slightly. “Senior Brother and I will present this technique to Master. With Master’s insight, he should be able to glean something useful from it. We can then ask Master for guidance. Don’t cultivate it on your own, lest something unexpected happens.”</p><p>“Thank you for the reminder, Second Senior Brother. I understand!”</p><p>The dwarf cupped his hands.</p><p>The black-robed man then addressed the young man surnamed Fang. “Senior Brother, you must be careful venturing into the dragon’s den with the Corpse Puppets. The island is filled with Nascent Soul cultivators from various sects. If you can’t obtain that thing, decisively detonate the Corpse Puppets and retreat strategically. The cultivators outside the Azure Flood Sect will only think it's an internal matter of the Azure Flood Sect. In their confusion and uncertainty, they definitely won’t react so quickly, and that will be our opportunity.”</p><p>Hearing these words, everyone’s gaze involuntarily fell upon the two people standing behind the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>These two had their eyes tightly closed, silent as the dead.</p><p>Strangely, their auras were no different from ordinary people.</p><p>Even more shocking was their identity – they were the Bullfighting Peak outcasts they had captured earlier, yet now they obeyed their enemy without question, like two guards.</p><p>“It’s a pity that Master only bestowed two Blood Corpse Worms. If there were a few more, we could control several Nascent Soul Corpse Puppets to self-destruct, trapping and killing all the cultivators on the island, and we wouldn't have to go through all this trouble.”</p><p>Someone complained in a low voice.</p><p>The black-robed man glared at him fiercely. “Do you really think cultivating such wondrous insects as Blood Corpse Worms is so simple? Master has been cultivating them for who knows how long, and even with the aid of insect control secret techniques, he’s only managed to raise them to the third transformation. If there were a few more, I’m afraid our Black Serpent Mountain would be bankrupt.”</p><p>“Alright, enough nonsense. I’ll set off now. We must obtain that thing this time. If anyone dares to slack off or cause any slip-ups, I’ll skin them alive!”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang snorted coldly and flew out of the shadows with the Corpse Puppets.</p>
