<h1>Chapter 1829: Startled Retreat</h1><p>It was difficult to fathom Hongyuzi's intentions.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's true body had perished too quickly, and Qin Sang wasn't privy to the outcome of the battle between Hongyuzi and the two demons. He didn't know how much strength Hongyuzi still possessed.</p><p>Qin Sang was now on the verge of exhaustion.</p><p>The Flower Dew within him was nourishing his True Essence, but even if his True Essence fully recovered, it wouldn't be enough to turn the tide.</p><p>Slaying three demons in succession had relied on his physical prowess. Now, gravely injured, he was wholly dependent on the Inner Lion Seal to suppress his wounds.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that even if Hongyuzi's soldier-horse formation was broken, he wouldn't have the strength to face another late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Thoughts flashing through his mind, Qin Sang instantly made a decision. He retrieved several jade bottles, poured the Flower Dew into his mouth, turned, and extended his hand, continuing to press against the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>The firelight gradually dimmed, leaving only the Five Elements Crown's radiant glow within the palace. The five-colored brilliance pulsed like breath.</p><p>The fluctuations of the radiant light were gentle, seemingly harmless, yet Qin Sang's mind remained taut.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had already imparted the method of controlling the Five Elements Crown to Qin Sang. It wasn't the Activation Mantra, but rather a simplified Five Elements Restriction derived from the Emperor Bestowed Mountain's Five Elements Divine Inscription.  This restriction guided the Five Elements Spiritual Power to control the treasure, or perhaps, this was the Crown's Activation Mantra.</p><p>Currently, this method of control was clearly ineffective.</p><p>The Crown's Artifact Spirit was more like a chaotic consciousness of mutual devouring, sensitive and frenzied, devoid of reason. Any force attempting to control it would be deemed an enemy and immediately countered.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a control method for the moment. He could only follow his previous plan, take the treasure first, and figure it out later.</p><p>Back then, the three, including Sage Huiguang, had confined the Artifact Spirit and taken turns wielding the Crown to resist the demonic thoughts' invasion.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have such worries. Carefully controlling his Divine Sense, he entered the Five Elements Crown, allowing waves of demonic thoughts to assault him.</p><p>The madness within the demonic thoughts was terrifying, something ordinary people would dread. Yet, he willingly accepted them, unafraid of their impact on his mind.</p><p>Initially, the Artifact Spirit seemed to sense something, showing signs of restlessness.</p><p>Under the influence of the demonic thoughts, the fluctuations emitted by his strand of Divine Sense gradually changed, approaching the Artifact Spirit's aura.</p><p>As expected, the Artifact Spirit's agitation subsided, and its hostility towards Qin Sang's Divine Sense gradually diminished.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, Qin Sang dispersed his strand of Divine Sense, silently enveloping the Five Elements Crown, forming a thin barrier.</p><p>This barrier could, to a certain extent, isolate the Artifact Spirit from the outside world, confusing its judgment.</p><p>The Divine Sense barrier took shape.</p><p>Qin Sang's five fingers curled as if grasping. The Five Elements Crown trembled slightly, about to be drawn upwards, when the well platform suddenly shook.</p><p>The sudden tremor caused Qin Sang's expression to shift. He immediately cut off the drawing force and frowned at the well platform.</p><p>The well platform's vibrations nearly awakened the Artifact Spirit.</p><p>Staring for a moment, Qin Sang reached for the Crown again, his movements much gentler. The Five Elements Crown slowly rose and was smoothly grasped in his hand.</p><p>Storing the Five Elements Crown within the Thousand Jun Ring, Qin Sang glanced at the well platform again. A peculiar power within the platform enveloped the space where the Crown had been.</p><p>Back then, the platform had drawn the Crown into this place, likely due to this power. Fortunately, the platform's power was subsiding, and Qin Sang's actions hadn't triggered a significant reaction.</p><p>The situation was urgent. Qin Sang had no time for further investigation. Having retrieved the Five Elements Crown, he glanced around and located the deer antlers that had fallen into a corner of the palace.</p><p>The antlers were divided into two pieces, one black and one white, like black and white jade, emitting a crystalline luster. They were Xiahou's only remaining possessions.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the antlers and noticed several cracks on their surface. The luster within the cracks was murky, damaged during the demon core's self-destruction.</p><p>Holding the antlers in his left hand, light flashed on his right, and the fox and serpent corpses appeared in his grasp.</p><p>The serpent's corpse seemed the most intact, while the fox's was a gruesome sight, nearly dismembered.</p><p>Carrying the remains of the three demons, Qin Sang swept his Divine Sense outside the palace. His expression flickered, and a point of cyan light flew towards him.</p><p>It was the cyan jade bead that the Cyan Fox Saint King had previously taken out, used in conjunction with her three Dharma Bodies to besiege Xiahou.</p><p>"Is this the spiritual treasure you mentioned?"</p><p>Qin Sang inquired of Mo Xingdao beside him.</p><p>He sensed the fluctuations of a spiritual treasure from the cyan jade bead. No wonder the Cyan Fox Saint King had been able to force out Xiahou's innate divine ability. But because of this, she had been held back and hadn't had time to recall it, giving him the opportunity to strike.</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded. "This bead likely had pre-existing damage. Sage Huiguang helped her refine it. That fox demon relied on this bead for protection many times, and in the end, it nearly split in two."</p><p>Qin Sang rotated the cyan jade bead and indeed found a faint white mark.</p><p>Storing the cyan jade bead and the Kingfisher, Qin Sang pondered, then concealed the Phoenix Wings. Without hesitation, he flew out of the palace.</p><p>The two black dragons rallied and attacked.</p><p>Qin Sang blasted a path forward with his fists, unstoppable.</p><p>His body was frantically refining the Flower Dew into Toxic Essence, but Qin Sang knew he couldn't wait any longer. The more he hesitated, the easier it would be for the opponent to see through his weakened state.</p><p>Moreover, even if he wasn't Hongyuzi's match, with Thunder Escape alone, Hongyuzi would have a hard time stopping him!</p><p>Above the mirror surface.</p><p>Hongyuzi, though trapped by the Sealing Formation, showed no external injuries.</p><p>Looking down at the mirror surface, he waved his hand, sending out streaks of yellow wind and smoke. Some brushed against the mirror's surface like a gentle breeze, while others stirred ripples.</p><p>Having just suffered a significant loss, Hongyuzi was extremely cautious, the Nine Return Pearls hovering above his head, ready to be unleashed.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Ripples spread across the mirror surface as Hongyuzi probed its secrets.</p><p>His eyes flashed. He chopped downwards, striking the mirror surface heavily. Shimmering light erupted as a narrow portal was cleaved open.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Hongyuzi stepped through.</p><p>Unexpectedly, shortly after entering the mirror, he sensed a powerful aura surging upwards from the depths of the mirror space, hurtling towards him.</p><p>The intensity of the aura startled even Hongyuzi, but it didn't belong to the two demons who had ambushed him earlier.</p><p>The approaching aura was aggressive.</p><p>Astonished, Hongyuzi instantly retreated.</p><p>Then came a thunderous roar. A bizarre figure burst out of the mirror, appearing within his sight.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Hongyuzi stared at Qin Sang with suspicion, as if struggling to recall the origins of this monstrous being.</p><p>Aside from the absence of Phoenix Wings, Qin Sang's appearance was identical to what Xiahou had seen, a form that even demon cultivators found strange.</p><p>Then, Hongyuzi's pupils constricted, his expression drastically changing as he saw what Qin Sang held.</p><p>He hadn't seen the serpent demon, but judging from the aura emanating from the corpse, it had been a Demon Marquis-level powerhouse during its life.</p><p>Even more shocking were the fox corpse and the deer antlers. The aura they emitted clearly belonged to the two demons that had attacked him.</p><p>The fox's corpse was a horrific sight.</p><p>Although he hadn't seen Xiahou's body, even the deer antlers were lost and cracked. Xiahou's fate was easy to imagine.</p><p>Three Demon Marquises, could they all have been slain by this person?</p><p>Observing this person's aura, still overwhelmingly powerful, it seemed as if he hadn't exerted himself at all!</p><p>Hongyuzi gasped, unable to conceal his shock. He instinctively retreated several steps, back to the edge of the mirror.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were emerald green, like deep pools, glinting with ferocious light.</p><p>Under the effect of the Inner Lion Seal, his wounds had already healed. He stared intently at Hongyuzi, breathing slightly heavily, seemingly hesitant, weighing something.</p><p>Hongyuzi retreated all the way to the mirror's edge, the Nine Return Pearls radiating brightly, his face wary.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang made his decision. He took one last look at Hongyuzi, turned, and flew towards one end of the mirror.</p><p>The mirror connected to another illusory landscape, filled with deep gray dust. The thick dust obscured the sky and sun, resembling a realm of gray sand, forming a gray wall.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang about to enter the gray sand realm, Hongyuzi hesitated, opening his mouth, "Fellow Daoist…"</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang stopped and abruptly turned.</p><p>Fierce light erupted from his eyes, like two sharp swords thrusting forward.</p><p>Hongyuzi couldn't help but pause. With his mental fortitude, he wouldn't be intimidated by a mere glare, but this person's battle record was truly terrifying.</p><p>Even if this person had utilized some external force, slaying three demons in a row was beyond the imagination of ordinary cultivators.</p><p>While he hesitated, Qin Sang, staring at Hongyuzi, slowly retreated into the gray sand realm, his figure disappearing into the dust.</p><p>Hongyuzi ultimately chose not to interfere.</p><p>Blocking Hongyuzi's perception, Qin Sang immediately turned, summoned the Phoenix Wings, and with a flash of thunder, activated Thunder Escape at full power.</p><p>The mirror space wasn't far from the traps he had set.  Qin Sang didn't dare pause for a moment. Passing through one illusory landscape after another, he finally returned to the 'Cage Illusion.'</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly had been watching behind him the entire time, and hadn't detected any pursuers. It seemed Hongyuzi had indeed been deterred by his bluff.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and immediately sat cross-legged in the central cage. The Inner Lion Seal had reached its limit, its power dissipating. His old wounds immediately worsened, and a sense of weakness washed over him.</p><p>His injuries were more severe than before. Qin Sang waved his hand and retrieved more jade bottles.  Regardless of what kind of healing pills they were, he swallowed them all, trying every possible means to heal.</p><p>This place wasn't safe for hiding, not a place to stay for long.</p><p>Suppressing his injuries and recovering his True Essence as quickly as possible, Qin Sang stood up from the cage.</p><p>Before deciding to ambush Hongyuzi, Qin Sang had already prepared for his retreat, so he returned to the flower field along the predetermined path.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang remained extremely cautious, lest he run into Hongyuzi.</p><p>The journey was smooth. He safely returned to the flower field and activated the grand formation, finally truly safe.</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat on a meditation cushion, replaying the battle in his mind. His expression revealed exhaustion, not only from his severe injuries but also from the immense mental strain.</p><p>He rarely took risks, but this time, slaying three demons in a row was like dancing on a knife's edge. No room for error existed in any step.</p><p>One misstep, and while not utter ruin, the Five Elements Crown would certainly be lost.</p><p>Sitting quietly for a moment, Qin Sang carved out a meditation chamber beside him with his sword and summoned Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Seeing the cave dwelling, Mo Xingdao, unsure of his location, was puzzled.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "Fellow Daoist Mo, this is Qin's temporary residence within the Ritual Altar. Please rest and recuperate first. Qin also needs to heal his injuries as soon as possible."</p><p>Mo Xingdao hiding within the Ritual Altar was a temporary measure. Qin Sang had sworn not to control him and wouldn't go back on his word.</p><p>Qin Sang also considered that his Ritual Altar was special, related to the secrets of the Jade Buddha, and couldn't allow Mo Xingdao to remain in the flower field indefinitely.</p><p>After his injuries healed, he would send Mo Xingdao out of the Land of Calamity, find a place to settle him, and help him recover first. Later, he would consider exploring the Ritual Altar.</p><p>"I will follow Fellow Daoist's arrangements."</p><p>Mo Xingdao transformed into his human form and bowed slightly. Seeing Qin Sang's fluctuating aura, he knew he was eager to heal, so he didn't speak further, entering the meditation chamber. Then, he saw the stone door close, sealed by restrictions from the outside.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the floor, Mo Xingdao's eyes were distant, various thoughts flooding his mind.</p><p>He recalled his childhood, the scenes of his rise in the Northern Wasteland, his setbacks and triumphs.</p><p>He had once been besieged by all, yet he had carved a bloody path for himself, earning the title of the Northern Wasteland's number one rogue cultivator.</p><p>Without unforeseen circumstances, he should have continued to wander for the rest of his life, perhaps with a sliver of a chance to reach Nascent Soul.</p><p>Ever since he agreed to Su Zinan's request and sailed south, it had been a journey of opportunity, rewriting his destiny.</p><p>Exchanging for the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal at the trade fair, snatching the Spirit Rhinoceros Fruit at the Emperor Bestowed Mountain, being warned of danger by two Nascent Soul cultivators, and risking everything to forcefully transcend his tribulation…</p><p>He had always been unwilling to be controlled by others, content to be a rogue cultivator, yet he was at the mercy of fate.</p><p>He struggled desperately, yet ultimately, he had reached this point.</p><p>Mo Xingdao thought of Qin Sang outside.</p><p>Reflecting on it now, he was still utterly astonished.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had nearly perished at the hands of the Cyan Fox Saint King, barely escaping with his life. It was vivid in his memory. Now, he could actually slay three demons in a row.</p><p>A late-stage Nascent Soul demon had died at Qin Sang's hand!</p><p>During the chaos at the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, their strengths had been comparable. Reuniting in this foreign realm, the difference between them was now like that between the clouds and the mud.</p><p>Mo Xingdao felt a pang of self-pity and sighed softly. Then, he roused his spirits and focused on comprehending his puppet body.</p><p>The world of cultivation was infinitely profound, and anything was possible.</p><p>Until the day of his demise, he would never give up hope!</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>The two cultivated in silence. The flower field's grand formation isolated them from the outside world. No matter how much turmoil this battle caused outside, it wouldn't affect them here.</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly awoke, exhaling a turbid breath.</p><p>Inspecting his inner body, the worsened injuries caused by the Inner Lion Seal had impacted his foundation. He had only recovered sixty percent, but his foundation was now stable, and his subsequent healing speed would be very fast.</p><p>After so long, he still hadn't properly examined his spoils of war.</p><p>Glancing at the meditation chamber, within his cave dwelling, Mo Xingdao's every move couldn't escape his notice.</p><p>For so long, Mo Xingdao had remained motionless, unsure what technique he was cultivating.</p><p>Withdrawing his gaze, Qin Sang opened the Thousand Jun Ring, and several items floated out.</p><p>The most eye-catching were the cyan jade bead and the deer antlers.</p><p>Qin Sang took the cyan jade bead into his hand and probed it with his Divine Sense. Moments later, he revealed a look of regret.</p><p>Spiritual treasures required Activation Mantras to control, and this bead contained no such mantra within. Unless he found someone compatible with the bead to trade with, it was useless to him.</p><p>Sighing inwardly in disappointment, Qin Sang looked at the deer antlers.</p><p>The antlers had been refined by Xiahou for many years. Though damaged, they were still a rare treasure.</p><p>To prevent the Ghost Fang Kingdom and Hongyuzi from uncovering any clues, the antlers couldn't be exposed, best used by himself.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently. His Returning Wind Armor had been destroyed, and he would need to refine a new set of protective armor in the future.</p><p>But the deer antlers were sharp and best suited for refining offensive weapons. Perhaps they could be used to reforge his gauntlets.</p><p>The fox and serpent corpses would be dealt with similarly.</p><p>Then there were the storage artifacts of the Serpent Demon and the Cyan Fox Saint King.</p><p>The Cyan Fox Saint King's wealth wasn't as abundant as he had imagined. Qin Sang recalled what Mo Xingdao had said about their experiences in the Returning Ruins.</p><p>Within the Returning Ruins, the ferocious beasts had been agitated by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, their ferocity amplified, roaming everywhere, far more dangerous than before. The Five Elements Crown alone wasn't enough.</p><p>Especially the final stretch of the path to ascension, it was fraught with peril. Sage Huiguang and the Cyan Fox Saint King had destroyed several powerful treasures. If they hadn't needed Mo Xingdao to share the burden of the Artifact Spirit's pressure, his fate wouldn't have been merely the destruction of his life-bound puppet.</p><p>Qin Sang selected usable spirit materials from the two demons' belongings, which still amounted to a considerable gain.</p>
