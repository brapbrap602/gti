<h1>Chapter 469: Harboring Malicious Intentions</h1><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The handsome young man discreetly took out a talisman, ready to activate it.</p><p>Elder Jing seemed to have overheard their conversation. The bright moon suddenly streamed down a beam of moonlight, seemingly gentle like water, yet incredibly swift.</p><p>Like a celestial river descending, it reached the young man in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Petty tricks!”</p><p>Elder Palmstar scoffed, reaching out as if plucking stars, like a general arranging troops, instantly positioning the stars in the sky into a killing formation.</p><p>Starlight radiated in all directions, no longer merging into one, but condensing into a net.</p><p>The star net, sharp as a blade, blocked the moonlight.</p><p>The moonlight, transformed into a silver river, shattered.</p><p>Elder Palmstar was a half-step too slow, failing to sever all the moonlight. He only blocked half of it, but the remaining strands weren't a concern; the young man's cultivation was sufficient to handle them.</p><p>The young man raised his treasured sword horizontally, a bright sword light erupting, intercepting the moonlight's impact.</p><p>A muffled groan was heard, and the young man's face flushed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moonlight transformed into a long whip, lashing heavily onto the young man's sword.</p><p>A tremendous force struck, catching him off guard. Although unharmed, he was sent flying backward for dozens of yards before managing to dissipate the force.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, who had been observing the battle from the periphery, suddenly moved.</p><p>He sensed Elder Jing's gaze and understood her intention, saying without hesitation, "I can handle this one. Senior, focus on the other two!"</p><p>He hadn't left because he couldn't. From the moment the three from the Yuan Mirage Sect saw him, he and Elder Jing were in this together.</p><p>No matter what, the three from the Yuan Mirage Sect had to die!</p><p>He believed Elder Jing wasn't reckless. If she dared to ambush Leng Yuntian, she must have some assurance.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't rashly interfere in their fight, waiting for Elder Jing's explicit instructions before acting.</p><p>Seeing that Elder Jing wanted him to deal with the young man, not one of the two Golden Core cultivators, Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief.  If he exerted all his strength and used both his magical treasures, he could probably hold them off for a while, but it would certainly be perilous.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't so arrogant as to think he could defeat Golden Core cultivators, even if their realms were suppressed.</p><p>If it came down to it, his life was more important, even if it meant exposing his treasures.</p><p>Fortunately, Elder Jing was confident enough to take on two Golden Core cultivators at once.</p><p>In comparison, the handsome young man was much easier to deal with.</p><p>Against a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of anyone.</p><p>The Cold Gold Sword led the way!</p><p>The chilling sword light emitted extreme coldness, aiming straight for the young man's back.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely, moving like lightning, his hand gripping the Yin-Yang Compass, which shimmered with light.</p><p>He chose the perfect moment.  The young man, lashed by the whip, was in a disarrayed state, falling and yet to regain his footing, his back completely exposed.</p><p>Yu Shanting was entangled with Qingluan.</p><p>Elder Palmstar was manipulating the star formation, fully focused on Elder Jing.</p><p>No one could rescue the young man.</p><p>In an instant, the Cold Gold Sword was inches away from the young man. As a top-tier magical artifact, its power was undeniable. Enveloped by the sword's aura, the young man's entire body frosted over, his movements seemingly stiffening.</p><p>Just as the young man was about to die by the sword,</p><p>Suddenly, he turned his head to look at Qin Sang, a mocking sneer on his face.  He abruptly opened his right palm and flung it backward.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Countless glittering fragments scattered, and amidst the talisman shards, an inconspicuous dark light flashed – a small, dark hammer.</p><p>A Talisman Treasure!</p><p>The hammer flew with astonishing speed, bypassing the Cold Gold Sword and heading straight for Qin Sang.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, the hammer rapidly enlarged. He saw it clearly: its two ends were pointed like chisels.  Qin Sang had no doubt that if he were struck, it would leave a bloody hole in his head.</p><p>The young man had been guarding against him all along.</p><p>This wasn't surprising.  Appearing simultaneously with Elder Jing in the vast square, it was impossible for them to believe they weren't allies. They must have been on guard.</p><p>While he had been observing, they hadn't actively targeted him. Instead, they set a trap, secretly preparing the Talisman Treasure, attempting to eliminate the weakest one, him, in one fell swoop, and then concentrate on dealing with Elder Jing.</p><p>Perhaps the young man being whipped away was all part of the plan.</p><p>If Elder Jing's strength hadn't exceeded their expectations, allowing her to hold her own against two, they wouldn't have been unable to divide their attention. At this moment, he might have been facing more than just the young man alone.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. If it weren't for his years of experience on the battlefield, he might have fallen for it.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Facing the hammer, Qin Sang remained calm under pressure.  He raised the Yin-Yang Compass high, shooting out a beam of white light.</p><p>The quality of the Yin-Yang Compass was certainly inferior to a Talisman Treasure, but even the strongest Talisman Treasure couldn't ignore a top-grade magical artifact, and Qin Sang wouldn't rely entirely on artifacts.</p><p>The dark hammer, struck by the white light, didn't slow down but its trajectory deviated slightly.</p><p>This was enough!</p><p>Qin Sang, already prepared, instantly dodged the sneak attack, glaring coldly at the young man.</p><p>The Cold Gold Sword, naturally ineffective, was recalled.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>The young man hadn't expected Qin Sang to evade the Talisman Treasure so easily.  He looked over in surprise, toying with the dark hammer, and sneered, "It seems you're not all talk. You do have some tricks! Shadowless Sword... I'll see how capable you really are, daring to disrespect my senior brother!"</p><p>Qin Sang now knew who the young man's senior brother was.</p><p>Miao Xinglan.</p><p>Known as the Yuan Mirage Sect's top expert, his cultivation was formidable. He was the one sent by the Yuan Mirage Sect to Finger Peak this time.</p><p>Because of Senior Qingzhu, Shaohua Mountain and the Yuan Mirage Sect had an irreconcilable conflict, affecting their disciples.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to get involved in these grudges and didn't want to actively make enemies, but after being repeatedly targeted by Yuan Mirage Sect disciples, he naturally wouldn't tolerate it forever.</p><p>Even a clay Buddha has three parts of a fiery temper.</p><p>So he found an opportunity, working with Senior Brother Rong to teach Miao Xinglan a lesson. Neither side suffered any substantial damage, but the grudge was formed.</p><p>The handsome young man seemed to have a good relationship with Miao Xinglan, no wonder he looked at Qin Sang with displeasure.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The dark hammer shot towards him again.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated explosively, putting away both the Yin-Yang Compass and the Cold Gold Sword. At the same time, a blue light rose from his palm, eventually transforming into a round mirror.</p><p>Also a Talisman Treasure!</p><p>This Talisman Treasure was seized from a pseudo-Golden Core cultivator of the Heavenly Alliance.  The young man harbored malicious intentions, and Qin Sang wasn't a kind person either.</p><p>He had long prepared his Talisman Treasure.</p><p>Unfortunately, although the young man was arrogant in his words, he wasn't careless in combat. Qin Sang hadn't found an opportunity for a sneak attack with the Talisman Treasure and was forced by the dark hammer to reveal his own.</p><p>The round mirror rose high, meeting the dark hammer.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The two Talisman Treasures clashed, separating instantly.</p><p>After the brief collision, they transformed into two streams of light, one blue and one dark, chasing each other between Qin Sang and the handsome young man.</p>
