<h1>Chapter 1764: Luring the Snake Out of Its Hole</h1><p>Deep beneath the Rose Butterfly Mountains, an almost imperceptible fluctuation brushed against Qin Sang's senses, fleeting and easily missed if one's focus wavered even slightly.</p><p>Finally, a reaction!</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit surged, his entire being focused on manipulating the secret technique, meticulously searching the area where the fluctuation originated.</p><p>After a stick of incense had burned, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, pondering, "Could this be a seed of the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower?"</p><p>He hadn't found the main body of the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower itself, but he sensed a peculiar aura in that location.</p><p>It was a fissure deep within the earth.</p><p>Even if someone were to delve into the depths at this very moment, they would find nothing unusual.</p><p>However, with the aid of his secret technique, Qin Sang could sense that the aura was concealed within a piece of earth and stone beside the fissure, perfectly blended with its surroundings.</p><p>This was a seed of the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower.</p><p>This was a unique characteristic of this spiritual flower. Upon reaching maturity, it would scatter its seeds throughout its territory.</p><p>At specific times each day, the spiritual flower would shift between its seeds at random. Only during these fleeting moments of movement could it be detected by this particular secret technique.</p><p>The fact that Qin Sang hadn't found the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower itself meant that the flower had just moved.  However, Qin Sang wasn't discouraged. Even if he had pinpointed the flower's location, he wouldn't dare to pluck it rashly.</p><p>He had to locate all the seeds and seal them, ensuring that both the flower and its seeds were harvested simultaneously, leaving no room for error.</p><p>If even a single seed were missed, the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower might escape. And if the spiritual flower sensed danger in its territory, it might relocate, making it incredibly difficult to find again.</p><p>Having confirmed the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower's existence, there was no need to rush.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently employed his secret technique.  Every time the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower moved, it revealed the location of another seed.</p><p>Gradually, repetitions began to appear, increasing in frequency.</p><p>Furthermore, as Qin Sang grew more familiar with the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower, he could now locate other seeds based on the ones he had already identified.</p><p>By this point, the main body of the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower was also revealed to Qin Sang.</p><p>It was a spiritual flower that seemed to shift between the ethereal and the tangible. Its seeds could be sown within rocks, water, or even take root within other plants.</p><p>The Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower could exist anywhere, seamlessly blending with its surroundings. Only when it shifted into water did Qin Sang glimpse its true form.</p><p>It was a four-petaled spiritual flower.  The colors of the four petals were not fixed; each time Qin Sang saw them, they were different, but always exceptionally vibrant.</p><p>Having expended considerable effort to locate the spiritual flower and its seeds, and confirming that no seed had been overlooked, Qin Sang still held back.</p><p>Marking the location of all the seeds, Qin Sang left his cave dwelling. His gaze swept across the mountain range as he quietly flew towards one end of the Rose Butterfly Mountains.</p><p>The territories of the two Demon Commanders, Chiwei and Zhaoyou, were located at opposite ends of the Rose Butterfly Mountains. He was currently heading towards Zhaoyou's fortress.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to plan ahead, considering the possibility of exposure and selecting the optimal location and timing for his operation.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang was busy in the Rose Butterfly Mountains...</p><p>On the border of the Ghostfang Kingdom...</p><p>Two figures descended from the clouds, landing within a desolate mountain range.</p><p>They moved through the forest, their figures flickering, their auras restrained, leaving no trace of their passage.</p><p>The demons that crossed their paths remained oblivious, as if the two figures didn't exist.</p><p>One of them wore Daoist robes, a long beard flowing from his chin, exuding an immortal air, his demeanor otherworldly.</p><p>The other, however, appeared rather peculiar, vastly different from ordinary humans.</p><p>This individual wore black armor, his physique imposing and robust.  The exposed skin was also black, shimmering with a metallic sheen, as if his body wasn't flesh and blood but rather forged from some type of spiritual metal.  His movements lacked the lightness of the Daoist, carrying a sense of heaviness.</p><p>His face, too, resembled cast iron, his expression unwavering. Anyone who met his gaze would feel an immense pressure.</p><p>He was silent, following half a step behind the Daoist, uttering not a word. If it weren't for his sharp, keen eyes, he could easily be mistaken for a guardian puppet.</p><p>After crossing several mountain peaks, the Daoist surveyed the surroundings, pausing briefly before speaking, "Fellow Daoist Mo, we're about to enter Marquis Liuhou's territory within the Demon Kingdom. It's time to contact Fellow Daoist Cuiwei."</p><p>The dark-skinned, strange man remained silent, retrieving a jade talisman and crushing it. A flash of spiritual light flickered and vanished, an invisible wave radiating outwards.</p><p>The Daoist sensed for a moment, then said, "It seems Fellow Daoist Cuiwei isn't nearby. Let us continue onward."</p><p>The two set off again. Although they were on foot, their speed was unimaginable for ordinary mortals.</p><p>As they traveled, the Daoist recalled something, retrieving a scroll and handing it to the dark-skinned man. "This scroll contains eight inscribed talismans. When activated simultaneously, they possess the power of confinement. During our upcoming battle with Marquis Liuhou, Fellow Daoist Mo, conceal yourself and seize the opportunity to unleash them. You're sure to inflict a heavy blow."</p><p>The dark-skinned man silently accepted the scroll, unfurling it and examining it carefully for a moment before frowning. "Fellow Daoist, are you not confident in capturing Marquis Liuhou alive?"</p><p>He knew the identity of the person before him – the esteemed Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Imperial Censor!</p><p>Within the Dao Court, a Transcendent Realm True Person could preside over a regional altar, considered to have formally entered the inner circle, holding the rank of Fifth Grade Upper Clear Profound Capital Grand Master.</p><p>Above that were the Regular Fifth Grade Upper Clear Assisting Guard Immortal Minister, the Fourth Grade Upper Clear Profound Capital Imperial Censor, and finally, the Regular Fourth Grade Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Imperial Censor.</p><p>Rank reflected strength.  This individual's position within the Dao Court was second only to the Five Talismans Grand True Person.</p><p>If he remained within the heart of the Dao Court, he would be the lord of a prefecture!</p><p>Fellow Daoist Cuiwei, whom they were going to meet, was also no ordinary figure. He was the Fourth Grade Ninth Heaven Investigator of the North Pole Demon-Exorcising Court, half a rank below this individual.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Cuiwei once clashed with that Demon Marquis on the battlefield. It is said he couldn't gain the upper hand.  Who knows what progress that demon has made in these past years. As the saying goes, caution is the parent of safety. We are deep within the Ghostfang Kingdom, and it's best to err on the side of caution," the Daoist said frankly.</p><p>The dark-skinned man was surprised. "Since you're not entirely confident, why not request a senior with higher cultivation to ensure success?"</p><p>"You mean requesting a Grand True Person?"</p><p>The Daoist slowly shook his head. "Grand True Persons must preside over their altars.  Such a trivial matter hardly warrants their involvement."</p><p>The dark-skinned man disagreed. "The Dao Court's two courts are working together, employing various illusions to conceal your movements. Such meticulous efforts suggest that Marquis Liuhou is of significant importance to you.  If that's the case, why not request a Grand True Person to ensure complete success?  You don't seem like someone inflexible."</p><p>"It appears Fellow Daoist Mo is genuinely concerned for the Dao Court's well-being.  I'm deeply gratified," the Daoist said with a faint smile. "There are some matters that you will gradually understand in time. If a Grand True Person were to come here, they wouldn't be able to conceal their aura like we can."</p><p>Hearing this, the dark-skinned man's eyes gleamed with curiosity. Seeing the Daoist's reluctance to elaborate, he refrained from further questioning.</p><p>The Daoist continued, "This infiltration of the Ghostfang Kingdom to hunt demons is actually Fellow Daoist Cuiwei's own initiative. Other colleagues don't agree, and I also believe there's a hint of impatience in his actions. However, I owe Fellow Daoist Cuiwei a favor, so I can only accompany him on this risky venture. Marquis Liuhou likely won't expect us to dare infiltrate his territory and seek him out. Fellow Daoist Cuiwei has laid a trap to lure him out.  If it works, our chances of success are high."</p><p>"I fear the bait might be discovered, turning into a trap against us," the dark-skinned man remained pessimistic.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Cuiwei has been preparing for this for many years. His plan is meticulous, and there shouldn't be any errors. Once the bait is exposed, coupled with the subsequent arrangements, it will certainly disrupt Marquis Liuhou's territory.  As for whether it will lure him out of his fortress, that depends on luck."</p><p>The Daoist explained the plan, pausing before adding, "Of course, if we find the situation unfavorable, I'll advise Fellow Daoist Cuiwei against taking further risks."</p><p>The dark-skinned man seemed convinced and fell silent.</p><p>The two continued to travel swiftly through the forest.</p><p>...</p><p>Marquis Liuhou's fortress appeared as usual.</p><p>However, the Marquis himself wasn't present.</p><p>After taking human form, Marquis Liuhou became a handsome man, dressed in white robes, his demeanor elegant and refined.</p><p>It was difficult to connect him with the fearsome Great Demon he truly was.</p><p>Far from the fortress, nestled within a mountainous wilderness, several bamboo pavilions stood amidst lush greenery.  A stream flowed gently, surrounded by towering pines and cypress trees, capturing the essence of the surrounding natural beauty.</p><p>Marquis Liuhou sat cross-legged on a bamboo mat, a tea table with fragrant tea placed before him.  Steam rose from the cups, the spiritual tea exuding an enchanting aroma.</p><p>Opposite him sat a large man in golden armor.</p><p>The golden-armored man's posture was less refined, his demeanor casual.  He picked up the spiritual tea poured by Marquis Liuhou and gulped it down.</p><p>Seeing his companion's unrefined manner, Marquis Liuhou shook his head repeatedly. "This is a rare immortal tea, highly sought after even by Dao Court officials.  Brother, drinking it like that is akin to burning a lute and boiling a crane."</p><p>"Nonsense immortal tea!  It's not as good as the spiritual wine in your fortress!"</p><p>The golden-armored man expressed his disdain with a gruff voice, tossing the cup back onto the table and leaning against the bamboo mat, his tone lazy.  "Brother, do you plan to never return to the fortress, just hiding out in the wilderness like this?"</p><p>Marquis Liuhou replied with a smile, "Weren't we all roaming the wilderness before we attained enlightenment?  Has it only been a few years, Brother, and you're already unaccustomed?"</p><p>"I don't mind, but Brother, you haven't even seen the shadow of the enemy, hiding outside all the time, not even daring to return to your fortress. It doesn't sound very good, might invite ridicule," the golden-armored man sighed.</p><p>"Losing some face is better than losing my life!"</p><p>Marquis Liuhou's smile vanished. "Such a simple task, and yet it went awry under my watch.  Losing a general is one thing, but I fear it might prematurely expose the plan above.  King Yuanming didn't punish me, which is fortunate, but there's no guarantee the humans won't deduce something, deeming me the culprit and sending someone after me."</p><p>The golden-armored man was stunned, leaning forward and asking in a deep voice, "Brother, what do you actually know?  The Dao Court's appointed territorial lords have always just guarded the Dao Court, never serving any greater purpose.  We're imitating the humans and establishing Demon Gods.  Could there be some hidden meaning?"</p><p>Unexpectedly, Marquis Liuhou shook his head. "I'm also just following orders.  I couldn't possibly know more than you, Brother.  However, you should remember, the words 'Demon God' have been circulating for a long time.  And the plan to probe the human reaction last time was personally driven by King Yuanming. There must be a scheme at play."</p><p>Pausing, he pointed towards the heart of the Ghostfang Kingdom.  "Brother, have you noticed?  These past few years, not only King Yuanming, but the other kings as well, have all seemed to vanish?"</p><p>The golden-armored man fell into thought, hissing, "Now that you mention it, Brother, I haven't heard of any major moves from any of the kings these years."</p><p>"Precisely!"</p><p>Marquis Liuhou said seriously, "Regardless of the truth, we must be cautious!  If King Yuanming is undertaking something major, he may not be able to attend to external matters. If I were attacked, the royal court might not be able to provide timely assistance. It's better to hide outside directly."</p><p>The golden-armored man clicked his tongue. "Hearing you say this, Brother, I'm becoming more and more curious. If the Dao Court is truly as you suspect, sending someone after you, then the so-called territorial lords and Demon Gods might hold a shocking secret!"</p><p>At this point, he couldn't help but exclaim, "The Dao Court claims to be able to summon celestial soldiers and generals, and even the deities of the Milky Way, yet they're playing around with insignificant territorial lords.  I used to scoff at them.  Could it be that those Daoist myths and legends are actually true?"</p><p>"As long as the Dao Court doesn't dispatch a Grand True Person, if we manage to capture someone, perhaps we can extract some information."</p><p>Marquis Liuhou said calmly.</p><p>"Difficult!"</p><p>The golden-armored man shook his head. "We've been at war with the Dao Court for countless years, and we've captured Dao Court Profound Cave True Persons before. We should have been able to find out by now. The real secrets are probably only known to Grand True Persons."</p><p>At that moment, Marquis Liuhou's expression suddenly changed.  He reached out and grasped at the void, a transparent insect appearing in his palm.</p><p>"Someone from the Dao Court?" The golden-armored man pushed himself up from the table, his face filled with killing intent.</p><p>"Commander Ying was suddenly killed…"</p><p>Marquis Liuhou's face was filled with confusion. Commander Ying was the strongest among his Demon Commanders.  His death was a significant loss.</p><p>But if it was an assassin sent by the Dao Court, why would they reveal themselves prematurely, targeting a mere Demon Commander?</p><p>Marquis Liuhou couldn't understand. Could they be trying to lure him out using Commander Ying?  It seemed too reckless.</p><p>"How many are there?" the golden-armored man asked.</p><p>Marquis Liuhou hesitated. "It seems there's only one."</p><p>The golden-armored man snorted.  "It must be a trap to lure us out.  Since there's no aura of a Grand True Person, let's see if they have the ability to swallow us whole! Let's go!"</p><p>The two demons vanished in a flash.</p><p>…</p><p>At this time...</p><p>Qin Sang was in the Rose Butterfly Mountains, preparing to harvest the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower.</p><p>He had previously investigated the fortresses of the two Demon Commanders, then left the Rose Butterfly Mountains to venture deeper, surveying the surrounding terrain, the deployment of demon troops, and estimating the time it would take for the Demon Marquis to arrive, finally settling on a strategy.</p><p>Unnoticed, he had already set up restrictions around all the seeds of the Dreamshift Four Seasons Flower.</p><p>Qin Sang locked onto the main body of the spiritual flower, formed a hand seal, his gaze focused, and abruptly pressed his hand towards the ground.</p><p>Simultaneously...</p><p>Northwest of the fortress, only a few hundred miles away, True Person Cuiwei was waiting for reinforcements.</p><p>Reinforcements were on their way.</p><p>However, he looked at the corpse of a giant black eagle at his feet, his face ashen.</p><p>He had concealed himself here, waiting for the opportune moment, believing his presence to be undetectable.  Being in enemy territory, he didn't dare recklessly extend his divine sense. He didn't know what technique this demon eagle had used to suddenly appear and intrude.</p><p>The demon eagle was incredibly alert, instantly sensing something amiss and attempting to send a warning signal.</p><p>In that critical moment, True Person Cuiwei had no choice but to strike down the demon eagle. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to prevent the message.</p><p>The plan had failed before it even began!</p><p>True Person Cuiwei could already sense the aura of the Demon Marquis rapidly approaching.</p><p>To his horror, it wasn't just one aura!</p><p>At the fortress at that moment...</p><p>A Daoist arrived quietly, glanced towards the north, a slight smile playing on his lips. He flicked his finger, a streak of sword light shooting from his fingertip, aimed directly at the fortress. (End of Chapter)</p>
