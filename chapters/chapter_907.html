<h1>Chapter 899: The Stone Platform</h1><p>Chapter 899: The Stone Platform</p><p>“That was all orchestrated by Master Wu.  He himself, due to forcefully cultivating that technique, was attacked by demonic energy, his personality drastically changed, nearly causing a great calamity and destroying the foundation of our sect. The chaos that day continues to have repercussions even now.  Father no longer pursues the matter; letting Master Wu take you away was already the utmost kindness…”</p><p>Elder Lu disagreed with the strong man.</p><p>The strong man waved his hand, interrupting Elder Lu, sneering, “Our master is deceased. Naturally, you can say whatever you want!  I, Gao, am not here to argue about right and wrong. After leaving the Lan Dou Sect, several senior brothers suffered countless tortures. Following Master’s last words, we finally devised a method that might alleviate our suffering, but it requires that stone platform.  Junior Brother Lu, considering our past brotherhood, hand it over, and let's forget past grievances!”</p><p>Elder Lu was surprised, but firmly refused, “This artifact is of great importance and cannot be removed from Dongming Island. As for solving the hidden dangers of the  *Lei Technique*, that's utter nonsense.  It was simply discovered alongside the *Lei Technique*, possessing some auxiliary function. Master Wu and Master had studied it countless times.  Senior Brother Gao, are you trying to deceive me into believing you don't understand this technique?”</p><p>The strong man snorted, “If you don’t believe me, let me go to the Thunder Cave and try it. Then you will know!”</p><p>Elder Lu's brows furrowed, suspicion arising in his heart.</p><p>Could he actually have truly grasped something?</p><p>Yet, even two Yuan Ying masters working together for years had achieved nothing.</p><p>At this moment, Hua Yang Daoist, who had been observing the three, showed a flicker of doubt in his eyes, but he remained hesitant.  After a moment's thought, he sent a voice transmission to Elder Lu.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu, in that case, let them present their method first.  Let's verify its authenticity before further discussion.”</p><p>Elder Lu nodded slightly and said, “If it can solve the hidden dangers of the *Lei Technique*, it will benefit us all.  Senior Brother Gao, let me examine your method first. If it's effective, I am not unreasonable.”</p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p>the young man surnamed Fang, standing at the back, looked up, his eyes flickering.</p><p>The strong man feigned contemplation, then took out a jade slip and handed it to Elder Lu, “Please examine it, Junior Brother Lu!”</p><p>As he spoke, a flash of bloodshot light suddenly appeared in the strong man’s pupils.</p><p>Hua Yang Daoist’s face changed drastically, shouting, “He’s not Senior Brother Gao! Beware of a trap!”</p><p>At the same time, his whisk shot out, transforming into countless fine threads, rushing towards the strong man.</p><p>But he was a step too slow. The strong man’s lips curled into a sinister smile, his expression suddenly stiffening, his throat emitting an inhuman sound.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The strong man’s body suddenly exploded.</p><p>A cloud of blood mist exploded, filling the bamboo pavilion. The strong man’s body vanished completely. This blood mist, condensed from the strong man’s entire life essence, was like a living thing, pulsating, from which emerged a slender blood-colored dragon, opening its bloody maw, and in a terrifying shriek, lunged at the nearest Elder Lu.</p><p>Elder Lu, being a late-stage peak expert and with Hua Yang Daoist’s timely warning, remained calm despite the imminent danger.</p><p>He waved his hand, unleashing a torrent of True Qi, forming a wall of light, but it shattered upon contact with the blood mist, the blood dragon already close at hand.</p><p>Elder Lu's face changed slightly, a blue light flashed from his dantian, and a dragon-eye-sized pearl shot out—his life-saving treasure.</p><p>He activated the treasure, and a vast water-elemental force slammed into the blood dragon like a tidal wave.</p><p>Simultaneously, Hua Yang Daoist’s whisk arrived, the white threads like silver needles, piercing the blood dragon.</p><p>It seemed the danger was averted.</p><p>However, the others didn't possess Elder Lu's strength.</p><p>At the moment the strong man's body was detonated by the Blood Corpse Insect, the cultivator surnamed Hong also exploded, his life essence devoured by the Blood Corpse Insect, transforming into another blood dragon.</p><p>The Blood Corpse Insect was a third-stage spiritual insect; after consuming the life essence of a Nascent Soul cultivator, its power would increase dramatically to its limit, until the life essence was depleted. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Otherwise, the young man surnamed Fang wouldn't dare to single-handedly challenge so many powerful enemies with only two corpse puppets.</p><p>Under Fang's deliberate guidance, the cultivator surnamed Hong stood close to two early-stage Nascent Soul cultivators of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>Those two never expected their former senior brother to attack them; they were completely unprepared.</p><p>The corpse puppets exploded.</p><p>Before they could react, the two were enveloped in the blood mist.</p><p>Two screams rang out from within the blood mist, followed by a figure tumbling out, utterly dishevelled.</p><p>His face, ravaged by the blood mist, was beyond recognition.  Fortunately, he was a cultivator at the Jiedan stage, and he managed to activate his spiritual energy and protective treasures in time, escaping with his life.  Unfortunately, another voice quickly fell silent.</p><p>Then, another loud bang echoed from the blood mist, which thickened further, giving birth to an even larger, monstrous blood serpent that lunged at the escaping man.  Terror etched on his face, he turned to flee, only to glimpse a blood-red sword piercing his back with terrifying speed. He died instantly, his body enveloped by the blood mist, his lifeblood devoured by the blood-corpse insects.</p><p>Meanwhile, the young man surnamed Fang and the blood serpent fought together. He revealed his true cultivation, almost matching that of Master Lu, though slightly inferior. Clad in strange insect armor, he and the serpent forced Master Lu to retreat repeatedly. He single-handedly held off Master Hua Yang and another cultivator, leaving the three to helplessly watch their fellow disciples perish at the hands of the blood-corpse insects.</p><p>This was, of course, because Fang had prepared in advance, while Master Lu and the others were caught off guard. This suppression couldn't last, however. The blood-corpse insects, having already consumed the lifeblood of three Jiedan cultivators, had grown vastly stronger and joined the attack.</p><p>While relentlessly assaulting the Lan Dou sect cultivators, Fang silently chanted an incantation.  The blood mist in the bamboo pavilion remained dense and the serpent merged into it, forming a seemingly impenetrable barrier that trapped Master Lu and the others. Fang’s attack was swift and decisive, clearly well-planned.</p><p>Other cultivators on the bamboo platform outside discussed the Lan Dou sect, but to no avail. Some left to check on their disciples, but most stayed. When they heard the commotion, before they could understand what was happening, they saw the bamboo pavilion transformed into a sea of blood, the stench nauseating.</p><p>Then, a shout rang out, its source unclear:  "Lu, you dare defy the Grandmaster's order?  Do you intend to betray the sect?!"</p><p>This question stopped everyone who was about to rush to the pavilion to rescue them, leaving them stunned and suspicious. The Lan Dou sect had only two Grandmasters.  Grandmaster Lu was trapped in the Demon Sea and unable to return. The one remaining at the mountain was Grandmaster Wu.  Could their previous suspicions have been correct?</p>
