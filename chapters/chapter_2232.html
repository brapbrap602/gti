<h1>Chapter 2222: Picking Up Shoes</h1><p>The wanted poster provided some conversation for the otherwise monotonous days, but it didn't affect the villagers' lives.</p><p>Back home, Qin Sang continued to recuperate.</p><p>He dared not rashly cultivate, only using secular methods of treatment.  Fortunately, he knew some healing techniques and, with the help of herbs, his condition improved daily.</p><p>One morning, when Qin Sang woke up, the sun was shining brightly outside, and birds were chirping merrily.</p><p>He was alone in the house.</p><p>It was the busy farming season. Because of his illness, his family had been seeking medical treatment for him, neglecting their farm work, and needed to catch up on planting.</p><p>Qin Sang got up, stretched his limbs, and felt his body lighter than the day before.  He was almost recovered.</p><p>Opening the door, Qin Sang smelled a faint aroma of food and medicine.  Entering the woodshed, he saw warm medicinal soup and leftover food on the stove.</p><p>Qin Sang, without changing his expression, swallowed the bitter medicine in one gulp, then carried his flatbread to the courtyard. He broke off a piece, crushed it, and scattered it on a stone slab.  He watched the birds peck at it while slowly eating his own.</p><p>The flatbread was coarser than what he'd eaten in previous days, a bit rough on the throat, as they had switched from refined grain to coarse grain.</p><p>Last year's harvest wasn't good, and most of the family's savings had been used for Qin Sang's treatment.  This year's crops were just planted and wouldn't be ready for months. They had to start budgeting now, otherwise the whole family would starve before the new harvest.</p><p>'Tap tap tap…'</p><p>In a short while, a flock of birds was attracted, pecking at the food before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the birds, lost in thought. His recent life stirred distant memories of his leisurely days at Qingyang Temple. Later, his travels with Xiao Wu, rebuilding Qingyang Temple, had also been quite carefree.  Unfortunately, ever since he embarked on his immortal path, he had never truly relaxed.</p><p>Even now, though he seemed to eat and sleep all day, he was constantly figuring out how to escape his current predicament.</p><p>Xi, having always been weaker than his elder brother, had never been taught hunting by their father.  If he suddenly suggested going hunting in the mountains, his parents would certainly not allow it.</p><p>The best plan was to follow a trading caravan, leave Feng City, and then find an excuse to leave the caravan along the way.</p><p>Xi's parents were far-sighted. Seeing that their third son couldn't make a living hunting like his elder brother, they had considered his future since he was a child. They had him study with an old scholar in the village for a few years, and he learned arithmetic. They planned to send him to work as a shop assistant, so Qin Sang leaving with the caravan wouldn't seem strange.</p><p>With Qin Sang's abilities, he could easily join the caravan if he wanted to. The problem was his parents' permission.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't want to waste too much time in the mortal world; he needed a swift solution.</p><p>"I'm finished too. I'll come back this afternoon!"</p><p>Seeing the birds eagerly eyeing the flatbread in his hand, Qin Sang quickly finished it, patted his bottom, and went out.</p><p>Half the hillside was terraced fields cultivated by the village. Standing by the stream, Qin Sang saw people working in the fields in small groups.</p><p>"Hardworking villagers, a truly realistic illusion!"</p><p>Qin Sang had lamented this more than once.</p><p>He knew he was in an illusion, yet he couldn't find any flaws. His family and the villagers were so vivid, working from sunrise to sunset, completely unaware that they were living in an illusion.</p><p>Other people who entered this illusion, without the jade Buddha's protection, probably had already accepted themselves as locals, believing this to be the real world!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Buddhist scriptures he'd read in the Central Plains of the Storm World. Buddhism has the concept of 'emptiness', believing the world is empty, even the Dharma is empty; the purpose of cultivation is to see through the nature of 'emptiness'.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't fully agree with Buddhist doctrines, but he couldn't help but draw a parallel with his current situation.</p><p>What kind of world was this?</p><p>While anxious to break free, Qin Sang was also extremely curious about this illusion.</p><p>He picked up a handful of river sand, watching the grains slip through his fingers.</p><p>If the illusion was as vast and boundless as the real world, with everything existing and following its own laws, continuing generation after generation, then as long as he didn't leave the illusion, where was the boundary between reality and illusion?</p><p>Could this illusion even construct a real world of immortal cultivation?</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and slowly walked down the mountain. He felt good today and planned to go to town to look for opportunities.</p><p>He greeted every villager he met, responding to their concerns with thanks.</p><p>As he approached the foot of the mountain, Qin Sang noticed a commotion in front of a house across the river.</p><p>An old man was being pushed out.</p><p>An old woman, muttering curses about there being no food, shoved an old beggar into the middle of the road and slammed the door. Qin Sang paused, recognizing the beggar from the city gate. He had planned to approach the beggar earlier but encountered him unexpectedly in the village.</p><p>“Ha ha ha…”</p><p>“He got thrown out again!”</p><p>“Good-for-nothing old man! Good-for-nothing old man!”</p><p>A group of children peeked from behind a wall, laughing at the beggar’s expulsion.  The beggar, unfazed, stuck out his tongue at them, scaring them away. He then hobbled to a bridge, resting on a stone, humming a tune.</p><p>The children soon returned, drawn by his harmlessness.  They played hide-and-seek near him.  The beggar, enjoying their energy, basked in the sun until a mischievous child stole his straw sandal and threw it into the river.</p><p>“Ha ha ha…”</p><p>The children ran off, hiding to watch him retrieve it.</p><p>“Hey! You brats, stop bullying an old man! Get my sandal!”</p><p>The beggar’s stern words and tap of his cane only elicited more laughter.</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the hill, crossing the wooden bridge. The children scattered at his approach. He went down to the riverbank to retrieve the sandal.</p><p>“I’m too old for this,” the beggar sighed, leaning against the railing. “You’re a kind child, unlike those brats.”</p><p>“How old are they?” Qin Sang climbed back up, out of breath. The effort was taxing.</p><p>He then saw the beggar lift his dirty foot, seemingly expecting help.</p><p>*Slap!*</p><p>Qin Sang pretended not to notice, tossing the sandal to him and bluntly asking, “Didn’t get any food?”</p><p>The beggar lowered his foot, picking up the sandal.  “People are heartless these days. How could they bear to watch an old man starve…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought he deserved it, but then saw the beggar’s hand tremble, his foot twitch, and the sandal fly off the bridge again, landing with a *slap* on the riverbank.</p><p>The beggar chuckled apologetically. “Old age, you know, clumsy hands and feet.  Trouble you again, young sir.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the beggar, then at the sandal, said nothing, and retrieved it once more.</p><p>“Be careful this time, old sir…”</p><p>Before he finished, *slap!*  The sandal fell again.</p><p>The beggar looked at Qin Sang with an innocent expression. Qin Sang stared back impassively.  Then, without a word, he went down to the riverbank and kicked the sandal into the river's current, where it was swept away.</p><p>“Hey hey hey!” The beggar cried, grabbing the railing. “You said you were kind! Why did you throw away my sandal?”</p><p>Qin Sang climbed back up, brushing off his clothes. “I thought you didn’t want it anymore, it looked so worn.”</p><p>“Heartless! Heartless!” The beggar muttered, seeing Qin Sang about to leave, and used his cane to stop him. “Young man, you haven’t replaced my sandal yet! Where do you think you’re going?”</p><p>“I don’t have any sandals,” Qin Sang said, spreading his hands.  “I may be small, but my feet are bigger than yours. My father’s and brother’s are even bigger.  No sandals, but I do have some food.  If you’re hungry, come with me.”</p><p>He pushed aside the cane and walked away.  The beggar, after some grumbling, followed barefoot.</p><p>Qin Sang brought the beggar home. His parents weren't there yet. He went to the woodshed, brought out the leftover food, offered some to the birds, and then pushed the rest towards the beggar. “Eat.”</p><p>The beggar eyed the simple vegetable pancakes. “This is all you have?”</p><p>“You expect delicacies?” Qin Sang chuckled, about to take the pancakes back. “I guess you’re not hungry!”</p><p>“No no no…” The beggar quickly snatched the pancakes and devoured them in a flash.</p><p>“I know why your son kicked you out,” Qin Sang remarked.</p><p>The beggar scoffed. “You don’t understand! I left on my own. And I don’t have a son.”</p><p>"Oh," Qin Sang feigned enlightenment, "I also think no woman would want to be with you."</p><p>"Ahem..."</p><p>The old beggar stiffened, nearly choking. He pounded the table, "Quick, bring a bowl of water!  You have no eye for detail!"</p><p>Qin Sang served him a bowl of soup. The old beggar devoured it in a flash.</p><p>"Slow down! That's all there is. My parents and brother haven't eaten yet," Qin Sang said stingily.</p><p>The old beggar, satisfied, didn't ask for more. He propped his legs up and watched Qin Sang clean up.</p><p>"This little one is interesting," the old beggar chuckled, picking his teeth, far less harsh than before.</p><p>"What do you mean, interesting?"</p><p>Qin Sang brewed two cups of tea, using leaves her mother had dried.</p><p>"I've traveled far and wide, seen many mortals.  Few are as interesting as you. If you were born elsewhere, you might achieve something. But stuck in this backwater, and sickly," the old beggar sipped his tea.</p><p>Mortals!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred, but her face remained impassive. She sneered, "Mortals? You've just lived a long time and think you're a god? You've seen so much. Tell me, what's the world beyond the mountains like?"</p><p>"Far bigger, and more colorful than you can imagine."</p><p>The old beggar gazed at the sky, lost in thought. "Sadly, this world doesn't belong to us, to humankind."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, looking around. "We've all been born here, lived here, the wild animals are our food. How is it not our world?"</p><p>"Would you dare eat a bird?"</p><p>The old beggar countered.</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense!"</p><p>Qin Sang pretended to be furious, "You're senile!"</p><p>The old beggar snorted, looking down his nose. "You know nothing! A frog in a well, unaware of the vastness of the heavens! Fine, I'm full and have nothing better to do than argue with a little fool..."</p><p>With that, the old beggar drained his tea, grabbed his cane, and shakily stood up. He didn't mention the shoes, but walked out barefoot.</p><p>"Right, I didn't eat for free. Here's something for you!"</p><p>Before leaving, the old beggar seemed to remember something, pulled out an item, and tossed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang caught it—a bamboo scroll.</p><p>"You seem literate. Your illness is due to a congenital deficiency. This time it's cured, but it will recur in a few years, each time more dangerous. Practice what's written here. Even if you achieve nothing, it'll cure the root of your illness."</p><p>Qin Sang unfolded the scroll, surprised to find it was a cultivation method!</p><p>Only a very basic introductory section.  Following it, one could, at most, reach the third level of Qi Refinement.  However, the method lacked defined stages; it was simply called the 'Induction Chapter'.</p><p>When he looked up again, the doorway was empty.</p><p>Qin Sang had long suspected the old beggar's true identity. She had planned to gradually build rapport before extracting his secrets.  Unexpectedly, a meal had brought a stroke of luck. If only it had been this easy back then.</p><p>With this cultivation method, all problems would be solved!</p><p>To complete the act, Qin Sang pretended to be puzzled, reading each word carefully.</p><p>Perhaps the old beggar had chosen it specifically for him; the content was very simple, even someone with Xi's level of education could understand the literal meaning. Of course, understanding the words and grasping the cultivation method were two different things.</p><p>Qin Sang found that this method, while seemingly simple, heavily relied on talent and insight. With high enough talent and insight, one could quickly grasp the true meaning and sense the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Qin Sang pretended to be immersed in the method, but in his heart, he was scheming. The old beggar might be his best opportunity to enter the world of cultivation!</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the village.</p><p>The old beggar walked barefoot, singing as he headed back to the city gate for a good sleep.</p><p>Suddenly, the old beggar's expression changed. He turned towards Qin Sang's house, revealing an unbelievable look.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The old beggar vanished and reappeared in the courtyard, seeing Qin Sang sitting at the gate.</p><p>His eyes were closed, the bamboo scroll on his lap, as if immersed in a certain state.</p><p>Invisible ripples appeared in the void around him.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly trembled, his face draining of color, turning pale, and he vomited a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>Luan, returning from the fields, saw the blood and Qin Sang's weak condition. Terrified, he dropped his farming tools and rushed in, "Little brother, what happened?!"</p><p>The old beggar's eyes shone with excitement, his face full of relief.</p><p>"Heaven has eyes! I've found a seed of cultivation!"</p>
