<h1>Chapter 2089: Elder Brother</h1><p>The sky was overcast, dark clouds obscuring the sun.</p><p>The sea breeze gradually intensified, and waves surged across the ocean surface, a harbinger of an approaching storm.</p><p>Visible to the naked eye, distant dark clouds converged towards this location.</p><p>Amidst the wind and waves, a small boat slowly sailed forward. Logically, such a small, awning-covered vessel shouldn't appear on the open sea; a single wave could capsize it.</p><p>However, an unusual spiritual light flickered on the hull, making the small boat appear exceptionally light. Moreover, ordinary people couldn't see this boat; it was a Dharma Ark steered by a cultivator.</p><p>Three people stood at the bow, and figures could be seen within the awning.</p><p>One of them was Qin Li, cradling a small fox in his arms. The fox appeared languid and drowsy.</p><p>After being dispatched to the North Sea, they hadn't enjoyed peace for long before being rotated from Butterfly Island to the front lines. The so-called front lines were a narrow stretch of sea where the Tempest Realm and the Changyou Clan armies faced off.</p><p>Both sides were recuperating, lacking the desire for a large-scale offensive. However, their mutual animosity ran deep, making peaceful coexistence impossible. They would resort to any means to probe and harass each other, weakening the enemy's strength.</p><p>This stretch of sea had become a battlefield of contention. Both sides frequently dispatched small squads to skirmish in this area, effectively turning it into a hunting ground. Achieving victory could also boost morale.</p><p>Qin Li and the little fox had never experienced such a brutal war. Initially, they were at a loss, even terrified. Unexpectedly, their 'underling' played a crucial role.</p><p>Jian Yi was exceptionally valiant and decisive in his attacks. He also adapted remarkably well to the battlefield environment, as if he had been forged in the crucible of war. Under Jian Yi's leadership, they quickly acclimated to the battlefield and achieved repeated successes.</p><p>The battlefield was dangerous but also brimming with opportunities. For those who distinguished themselves, the various sects of the Tempest Realm were absolutely unsparing in their rewards. All manner of treasures dazzled the eye; there was nothing one could imagine that the sects couldn't produce.</p><p>With the accumulation of their war contributions, Qin Li and the little fox's cultivation soared, and they themselves underwent a transformation, becoming almost reluctant to leave.</p><p>"Why haven't we encountered anyone yet? I'm bored to death! Why don't we get a little closer?"</p><p>The little fox stretched and grumbled.</p><p>The purpose of this voyage was to amass enough war contributions to exchange for a spiritual material capable of refining magical treasures, in preparation for Qin Li's future Natal Magical Treasure.</p><p>Their magical artifacts were top-notch, leaving no need for replacements, and they couldn't consume medicinal pills without restraint. Although they were still some distance from the Golden Core stage, at this rate, breaking through to the Golden Core stage shouldn't be a problem, so they began planning for it now.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fox Immortal is full of confidence, but it's still best to be cautious. We're already close enough. Although we're on the periphery of the core battlefield, there's no guarantee that those Changyou Clan experts won't stray out. There are many precedents for this…"</p><p>A middle-aged man beside them gently advised.</p><p>It was said that within the core battlefield, there were Nascent Soul and even Deity Transformation stage cultivators battling. Even the residual waves from their clashes were unbearable for them.</p><p>"Do you think this Fox Immortal doesn't know these principles?"</p><p>The little fox snorted. "You don't need to lecture me!"</p><p>The middle-aged man wore a helpless expression, unable to deal with this willful little fox. Fortunately, the little fox knew its limits and wouldn't cause trouble in important matters.  With Qin Li also apologizing on its behalf, everyone wouldn't truly resent it.</p><p>Sure enough, Qin Li apologized repeatedly. He still maintained a simple and honest appearance, but after being tempered by the battlefield, he was no longer the same. If the enemy judged him by his appearance, they would certainly suffer.</p><p>Suddenly, the middle-aged man's expression shifted slightly, and he shouted in a low voice, "Careful!"</p><p>At the same time, everyone else on the Dharma Ark sensed impending danger. The area outside the ark abruptly turned a blinding white, and a fierce gale swept in, causing the ark to violently rock.</p><p>Only then did everyone see that at some point, over a dozen silverfish had surfaced on the sea surrounding the Dharma Ark. These silverfish were merely Foundation Establishment stage demonic beasts, which they had detected earlier but hadn't paid any attention to.</p><p>At this moment, however, powerful fluctuations emanated from within the silverfish, and they spewed white light from their mouths.</p><p>In the next instant, all the silverfish were disemboweled and instantly perished.  From their abdomens flew out orbs of light. With the appearance of the orbs, the white light became even more dazzling.  Substantial white light formed chains of light between the orbs, then coalesced into a vast net that enveloped the Dharma Ark, seemingly capable of absorbing the ark's spiritual energy, causing its light to abruptly dim.</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>Maniacal laughter echoed from afar. "Fallen into this General's carefully laid trap, let's see if you die or not!"</p><p>"Not good, retreat!"</p><p>The middle-aged man's face was filled with alarm and anger. He took out a fist-sized jade sphere from his sleeve and channeled his full power into it, resisting the net of light.</p><p>Qin Li and the others also reacted, each summoning their respective offensive magical artifacts. Without any deliberate discussion, they tacitly attacked the same orb of light.</p><p>Several streaks of light shot out from the Dharma Ark, seemingly about to strike the orb. However, the enemy had planned this for a long time and wouldn't let them succeed so easily.</p><p>All the orbs exploded, countless fragments shooting towards the Dharma Ark. In an instant, the ark was engulfed in a rain of blades and swords.</p><p>The middle-aged man was startled and immediately activated the Dharma Ark's strongest defensive formation, raising a transparent light barrier like an eggshell. A deafening roar followed as the barrier withstood the attack, instantly covered in cracks.</p><p>The jade sphere in the middle-aged man's hand cracked with a snap, nearly shattering. This Dharma Ark had been specially exchanged with a large number of war contributions. Unexpectedly, it was on the verge of destruction just after the battle began.  He couldn't afford to dwell on the heartache, shouting urgently, "Retreat!"</p><p>Qin Li and the others understood the gravity of the situation. Without hesitation, they summoned their magical artifacts, seized the opportunity to rush out, then fled back the way they came without looking back.</p><p>At this time, a group of Changyou clansmen were already flying towards them. Fortunately, Qin Li and the others reacted quickly enough and weren't surrounded.</p><p>Seeing that they hadn't trapped their opponents, a Changyou Clan commander roared.  Blue light emanated from the four ears of all the Changyou clansmen, coalescing into a beam of blue light resembling a stream of water.</p><p>As if drawn by some force, seawater flowed upwards into the sky, merging with the blue light.</p><p>The blue light swirled around the Changyou clansmen, and the converging seawater grew in volume, completely enveloping them, forming towering water giants.</p><p>Unlike the Zhuyan Clan, who focused on tempering their physical bodies, one of the Changyou Clan's innate divine abilities was to transform into these water giants, possessing formidable strength no less than body cultivators, and feeling no pain or fatigue.</p><p>This divine ability wasn't something everyone could grasp. The fact that this group could all transform into water giants indicated that they were an elite squad of the Changyou Clan.</p><p>One after another, the water giants took shape, their entire bodies composed of water, moving across the sea surface as if on solid ground.</p><p>They broke into a run, as if sprinting on land, causing the sea to rumble and roar, their speed rivaling that of Qin Li and the others' flying artifacts.</p><p>The seawater was their source of power.  One water giant reached down, effortlessly gathering a large mass of seawater, which solidified and took shape in his hand, ultimately molded into an axe head. He hurled it towards a streak of escaping light.</p><p>"Dodge!"</p><p>Qin Li was in charge of escape, and the little fox was on alert. Seeing the axe flying towards them, it warned Qin Li to evade.</p><p>The escaping light shifted, narrowly avoiding the axe, which whizzed past them and smashed into the sea.  The eruption of ferocious power blasted a deep crater into the ocean surface.</p><p>Witnessing the power of the axe, everyone felt a chill, understanding that they absolutely couldn't be hit by such an attack.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Swords, spears, halberds, axes, and hooks – the Changyou clansmen condensed the seawater into various weapons, forcing Qin Li and the others to dodge frantically, unable to form a defensive formation to counterattack.</p><p>After a period of pursuit, the Changyou clansmen gradually closed in.</p><p>Qin Li and the others were scattered. Once caught, they would surely suffer a crushing defeat.  Just then, the sea surface beneath one water giant erupted without warning.</p><p>A sword beam shot out from the water, incredibly sharp, piercing the water giant's body as if slicing through tofu.  The Changyou clansman inside didn't have time to react before being pierced through the heart, instantly killed!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The water giant's body exploded, seawater mixed with blood, shocking everyone.</p><p>Even before the water giant exploded, the sword beam had already shot out. The spiritual sword pierced the air, emitting the roar of a dragon and tiger, slashing diagonally towards another water giant nearby.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>This water giant was cut in half at the waist. The Changyou clansman inside was bisected, a look of excitement still etched on his face.</p><p>Instantly killing two with a single sword threw the Changyou Clan's formation into disarray.</p><p>To make matters worse, Qin Li and the others turned around, their previous appearance of helplessness gone, charging back to attack. Their prior performance was clearly a ruse.</p><p>"Do you think only you can set traps?"</p><p>The little fox let out a wild laugh, excitedly shouting, "Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p>The sword beam spun in mid-air, continuing to attack the other water giants.  The enemies it targeted met only one fate!</p><p>The situation instantly reversed. The Changyou clansmen fled in terror, but under the pursuit of the sword beam and Qin Li's group, they fell one after another.</p><p>Blood stained the sea red until the last Changyou clansman died beneath the sword. The enemy was completely annihilated, while Qin Li's side suffered only three injuries. Only the middle-aged man's Dharma Ark was destroyed, suffering the heaviest loss.</p><p>Everyone excitedly collected the spoils of war. The sword beam shot back, landing in Jian Yi's hand.</p><p>"Brother Jian, your swordsmanship is getting more and more formidable!"</p><p>Qin Li flew over, filled with admiration.</p><p>The little fox eyed Jian Yi suspiciously. "When we return this time, you're not going to break through again, are you?"</p><p>After meeting Jian Yi, they learned what a true genius was.  Over these years, Jian Yi's cultivation had increased at an unbelievable pace, surpassing them and breaking through to the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Jian Yi's strength went without saying. Without him, they might have already died on the battlefield.</p><p>Everyone speculated that since Jian Yi never used any magical artifacts other than his sword, his war contributions were likely all used to exchange for pills that enhanced cultivation. Even so, his cultivation speed was astonishing.</p><p>The little fox's address for Jian Yi had quietly changed from the initial 'Little Brother Jian' to 'Brother Jian.'</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jian Yi gently shook his head, sheathing his sword.</p><p>Everyone quickly cleared up the spoils of war. The middle-aged man delivered Jian Yi's share, but Jian Yi didn't reach out to take them. He suddenly looked up at the sky, his gaze sharp.</p><p>"What's wrong?" The little fox asked nervously.  Whenever Jian Yi showed this expression, it never boded well.</p><p>Before the words had finished echoing, a thunderous shout came from the horizon, "You dare slaughter my clan? You're courting death!"</p><p>Along with the shout, a powerful aura rapidly approached, and the horizon churned with monstrous waves, like a hurricane descending.</p><p>"Nascent Realm Third Stage expert!"</p><p>The middle-aged man exclaimed in alarm. The Changyou Clan's Nascent Realm Third Stage was equivalent to the human Golden Core stage.  No one present was his match.</p><p>With a clang, the spiritual sword left its sheath.  Jian Yi said in a deep voice, "You go first. I'll lead him away!"</p><p>"No…"</p><p>Qin Li hesitated, but Jian Yi cut him off with a sharp shout, "Go!"</p><p>Everyone had long since become accustomed to obeying Jian Yi, guessing he might have a method of escape. Moreover, if they stayed, they would only be throwing their lives away.  Returning quickly to seek reinforcements might offer a sliver of hope.</p><p>The middle-aged man bowed deeply. "Brother Jian, take care! Everyone, scatter and flee!"</p><p>"You must come back alive!"</p><p>The little fox yelled.</p><p>With his spiritual sword inverted, Jian Yi stood facing the wind, his expression calm, his aura restrained, as if accumulating power.</p><p>He had consulted with the Sword Slave and learned the art of Sword Nurturing.</p><p>To seek his own Dao, he decided to retrace the path of sword cultivation and seal his cultivation, combining it with enlightenment. Only by constantly seeking opponents on the battlefield, honing himself, and clarifying his path would he unseal the next level of his cultivation.</p><p>However, opponents also needed to be carefully chosen. He cultivated the Sword of Slaughter, not the Sword of Recklessness. He didn't want to be forced to unseal his cultivation before achieving enlightenment, nor did he want to die.</p><p>He had already reached the precipice of the Golden Core stage. This Nascent Realm Third Stage expert, coming alone, was perfect for honing his sword!</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The fierce wind and giant waves approached. Jian Yi's expression remained indifferent. He extended a finger, and his sword shot out!</p><p>By now, Qin Li and the little fox had fled far away, but they didn't dare stop, exhausting their strength to urge their flying artifacts onward, returning to seek reinforcements.</p><p>"Brother Jian will definitely be alright!"</p><p>Qin Li kept repeating the same phrase.</p><p>The little fox had also lost its usual cheerfulness, only hating that its cultivation was too low to do anything.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>The little fox suddenly yelled, pointing towards the core battlefield. "Go inside!"</p><p>Qin Li let out a gasp, immediately understanding. Returning to camp was too slow.  Going inside, they might encounter their own experts, but they might also encounter powerful enemies, a very high risk.</p><p>But the person and fox didn't hesitate, immediately changing direction and rushing into the core battlefield.</p><p>After a period of frantic flight, they finally sensed unusual fluctuations, the fluctuations of a battle.  In the distance, they saw both sides locked in a fierce struggle. Their own experts were surrounded by the enemy, at a disadvantage, unable to spare anyone to rescue Jian Yi.  They could only seek help elsewhere.</p><p>Whether it was good luck or bad, they encountered two more groups, all in similar situations.</p><p>They sensed something was amiss but couldn't pinpoint the reason. Gritting their teeth, they were about to go elsewhere when a sudden tightness gripped their hearts.</p><p>Amidst the battlefield, a Changyou Clan expert suddenly looked over, sneering, "Two fools courting death. This General will grant your wish!"</p><p>A white wave of water suddenly surged from the sea, shooting towards them.</p><p>Qin Li and the little fox were terrified, desperately trying to escape, but they were locked onto by the white wave and could only watch in despair as it approached.</p><p>At this critical moment, they sensed a familiar aura. The little fox looked up, its eyes widening abruptly.</p><p>Sword Qi pierced the sky. The newcomer was Jian Yi.</p><p>He arrived on his sword, completely unharmed. In such a short time, not only had he slain his opponent, but he had also successfully broken through to the Golden Core stage!</p><p>The little fox and Qin Li stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>As the white wave closed in, the little fox snapped back to reality, as if seeing a savior, and cried out hoarsely, "Elder Brother Jian, save me!"</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Thank you to Big Boss Watermelon Taro Check It Out for the Alliance Leader reward!</p>
