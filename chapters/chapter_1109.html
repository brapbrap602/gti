<h1>Chapter 1101  Re-cultivation</h1><p>“From now on, I should focus on cultivation and forming the Nascent Soul,”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Two jade slips, one recording the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*, the other the second part, the *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords*.</p><p>There’s no need to rush into comprehending the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and probed the second jade slip with his spiritual sense.</p><p>To this day, he still hadn't ascertained the true name of the *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords*.</p><p>In the Nether Valley, Qin Sang obtained the latter five layers, which could be cultivated from the mid-Golden Core stage to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>At that time, he had skimmed through it once, feeling both joy and worry.</p><p>The good news was that the subsequent cultivation techniques were still powerful.</p><p>The sixth and seventh layers, unsurprisingly, contained two new killing talismans, significantly different from the killing talismans created by Qingzhu, far more profound and grand.</p><p>Even a genius like Qingzhu couldn't break free from the limitations of his time and self.</p><p>This cultivation technique, it must have gathered the efforts of countless ancestors, undergone countless trials and refinements; it was beyond the reach of a single person.</p><p>He definitely needed to re-cultivate the true killing talismans, starting from the sixth layer.</p><p>Fortunately, Qingzhu's self-created techniques were based on this cultivation method, the two types of killing talismans could be considered of the same origin; even if he re-cultivated, he could quickly return to his current cultivation level.</p><p>Continuing to cultivate to the peak of the Golden Core stage wouldn't take too long.</p><p>The true killing talismans could further enhance his cultivation speed.</p><p>When he refined seven killing talismans, Qin Sang estimated that his cultivation speed would surely surpass that of dual-spiritual root cultivators.</p><p>But whether he could compare to true prodigies with heaven-grade spiritual roots, he wasn't sure; after all, Qin Sang's foundation was too poor.</p><p>However, after he formed his Nascent Soul, there would be no new killing talismans.</p><p>The *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords* only has seven killing talismans!</p><p>At that time, his cultivation speed would remain, but it would also be his limit.</p><p>What followed was what worried Qin Sang the most.</p><p>Before the Nascent Soul stage, as long as he could refine new killing talismans, he could easily break through; he hadn't encountered any bottlenecks due to cultivation.</p><p>This advantage would disappear after forming the Nascent Soul.</p><p>He would have to break through every bottleneck by his own strength.</p><p>“Killing talismans…”</p><p>Qin Sang softly uttered these two words.</p><p>After forming the Nascent Soul, the true function of the killing talismans would be revealed, related to the new divine ability, the *Seven Souls Killing Formation*.</p><p>During the Golden Core stage, the cultivation technique's divine abilities would automatically split into sword lights from the ebony sword.</p><p>In the early Golden Core stage, one sword light would split off, two more in the mid-stage, and four more in the late stage, totaling seven sword lights.</p><p>These seven sword lights all contained soul essence.</p><p>That is, what Qingzhu called sword souls!</p><p>If Qin Sang failed to form his Nascent Soul and had no other aspirations, he could use the seven sword souls to refine seven external avatars. With seven late Golden Core avatars, he could run rampant below the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The seven sword souls were closely related to cultivation after forming the Nascent Soul.</p><p>It actually required cultivators to project the killing talismans from their life-bound spirit swords onto the sword souls, then refine the seven sword souls into their own primordial spirit, gradually merging them with the seven souls!</p><p>The *Seven Souls Killing Formation* was thus named!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but gasp.</p><p>Three souls and seven spirits, mysterious and profound.</p><p>There were certainly many cultivation techniques in the cultivation world that involved the soul, but they were mostly general; this was the first time Qin Sang had seen a cultivation technique that truly distinguished the three souls and seven spirits and used them for cultivation.</p><p>The *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords* actually required the seven souls to merge with the sword lights and killing talismans, unheard of.</p><p>Did he have to cultivate the seven souls into sword souls?</p><p>“Soul-nurturing swords, soul-nurturing swords… it’s probably about cultivating the primordial spirit with swords?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the cultivation technique is incomplete; I don't know what the end of this technique is. Sword cultivators are indeed all madmen!”</p><p>In any case, it was impossible to change cultivation techniques before forming the Nascent Soul. He could focus on comprehending it after forming the Nascent Soul; perhaps his current cultivation was too low, leading to bias.</p><p>“With the sword spirit and fragments of the killing sword, I can foresee the opportunity to collect the complete cultivation technique and the killing sword in the future.  Giving up halfway would be too regrettable. Judging from the aura of the Ziwei Palace and the Seven Killing Hall, they must have been top-tier forces in ancient times. The cultivation technique painstakingly created by countless sword cultivators must have its reasons…”</p><p>Qin Sang put these doubts aside for now.</p><p>He observed the killing talisman of the sixth layer of the *Chapter on Soul-Nurturing Swords*, his mind connected to the ebony sword.</p><p>Dispersing the killing talismans created by Senior Qingzhu would cause his cultivation to drop to the early Golden Core stage. While it wouldn't be difficult to re-cultivate, it would still take some time.</p><p>The most pressing matter is to return and retrieve the Nine Phantom Sky Orchid, then attend to various matters. Once I find a safe haven, I will close myself off again and cultivate diligently to reach the peak of the Core Formation stage, preparing for Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>Another month passed.</p><p>Qin Sang left the cave abode and continued south.</p><p>"Xuanlu Pass is Shao Hua Mountain's territory. I wonder if Dongyang Bo and Shao Hua Mountain are still there. Three months have passed since the Purple Micro Palace appeared. Cultivators from the Seven Heroes Pass should have all come out to search for treasures. I'll ask someone first. If Xuanlu Pass is still in Shao Hua Mountain's hands, I'll have to enter through Yinshan Pass…"</p><p>Qin Sang made these calculations in his heart, his figure swiftly rushing south.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he encountered no other cultivators along the way.</p><p>This surprised him.</p><p>"Could it be that cultivators from the Little Cold Region aren't coming to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield anymore?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the peak of a barren mountain, gazing towards the south. The spiritual tide was nearing its end; Core Formation cultivators should be able to leave seclusion and search for treasures, yet there was no one in sight.</p><p>Even if the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is vast and sparsely populated, this shouldn't be the case.</p><p>This made him even more hesitant to enter the pass rashly.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something.</p><p>Years ago, while cultivating in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he had been taken by Che Yutao, a disciple of Dongyang Bo, to explore an ancient cultivator's relic.</p><p>It was there that he was captured by the Old Man of Earth Deficiency. After several near-death experiences, he managed to kill the Old Man and obtain his insect-controlling technique, the Red Fire Gilded Gold, and the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>After being transported to the Witch God Continent, these treasures played a crucial role in cultivating his natal insect Gu and subduing the Fat Silkworm and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>It can be said that his current achievements are closely related to that experience.</p><p>The cause of that incident was the Old Man of Earth Deficiency's covetousness of the Inner Scene Primordial Talisman of Xuan Yu Daoist from the Shangyuan Pure Quiet Palace. He claimed that this talisman would aid in Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>But after the Old Man of Earth Deficiency and Xuan Yu Daoist both perished, Qin Sang never found this talisman.</p><p>Later, a change occurred deep within the ancient cultivator's relic, and spatial cracks appeared around those mountains, forcing Che Yutao and others to retreat.  Being only at the Core Formation stage, he lacked the ability to explore further and never had the opportunity to return.</p><p>"I wonder who controls the ancient cultivator's relic now.  Perhaps I should go take a look?"</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang decided to investigate it along the way. He still remembered the location of the relic's entrance.</p><p>In truth, he knew his chances were slim. Even if the Inner Scene Primordial Talisman was still there, undamaged and unclaimed, whether it could actually aid in Nascent Soul formation was questionable.</p><p>Otherwise, why would the Shangyuan Pure Quiet Palace have trouble producing Nascent Soul cultivators?</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>This makes up for yesterday's two chapters. Today's chapter will be very late, so please don't stay up late. Read it tomorrow.</p>
