<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang moved swiftly, plucking the most valuable spirit herbs and placing them into jade boxes. Among them were the spirit lamp flower, which he valued the most, and a spirit herb that could aid Tan Hao in breaking through.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>Suddenly, a bell tolled.</p><p>The sound was melodious, reverberating throughout the entire Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang ceased his movements, listening intently.</p><p>The bell's sound had a peculiar rhythm.</p><p>Qin Sang had the Jade Buddha protecting his nascent soul, and didn't feel anything special. He glanced at Tan Hao.</p><p>He saw Tan Hao's eyes were slightly closed, his expression returning to calmness. The anxious and uneasy emotions he had felt when hearing Qin Sang's plans to compete with Grand cultivators for magical treasures had subsided considerably.</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue in wonder, concentrating intently, yet unable to find the source of the bell.</p><p>"Is it a magical treasure, or what?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Such a treasure, capable of clarifying one's mind, would be beneficial for cultivators. If he could move it, that would be great. Even if he couldn't use it, he could take it back to Green Sheep Abbey.</p><p>Tan Hao shook his head, saying regretfully, "The sound of the morning bell and evening drum doesn't originate from a magical treasure, otherwise I wouldn't have stayed here all this time. It seems to come from a strange restriction, but the Senior didn't say whether it's a method of the Pure Sea Sect, or if it comes from the original demon-suppressing seal."</p><p>"The world of cultivation is truly full of wonders."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, gaining more knowledge.</p><p>He put away the spirit herb Tan Hao needed, tossed the jade box to Tan Hao, straightened up, and looked at the pitted and uneven herb garden, "That's about it, they've already begun to break the restriction, we should prepare as well."</p><p>As he spoke, a black shadow flashed in.</p><p>Tan Hao was startled by the Nascent Soul puppet, and seeing the puppet standing obediently behind Qin Sang, he gained a greater understanding of Qin Sang's strength.</p><p>"A pity..."</p><p>Tan Hao glanced at the remaining spirit herbs.</p><p>The value of these spirit herbs was also considerable; in his eyes, they could even be called rare.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, "One must give in order to gain, only the interplay of truth and illusion can deceive their eyes. You wait here for my signal. When the time comes, you destroy the herb garden's restriction, revealing the spirit herbs within the mist. And activate your Misty Rain Urn  to create illusions of these spirit herbs, hiding them among the real ones."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang handed Tan Hao a jade slip, telling him to observe carefully and remember every detail, so that the illusions could be indistinguishable from reality.</p><p>Having been instructed by the Ghost Mother, Tan Hao understood the Buddhist restrictions. With thorough preparation, he could create chaos in the herb garden.</p><p>The Misty Rain Urn was a high-grade magical treasure, originally belonging to a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Boundless Sea. Because he provoked the Ghost Mother, he was killed by the Ghost Mother, and the Misty Rain Urn was casually tossed to Tan Hao.</p><p>During his time with the Ghost Mother, Tan Hao had indeed received many benefits.</p><p>This treasure was a magical treasure of illusion. The mouth of the urn spewed forth mist, creating illusions that closely resembled reality.</p><p>With this treasure, Qin Sang saved himself a lot of trouble.</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, taking out the Misty Rain Urn. Its exterior was a stone urn, smaller than the size of a palm, with patches of dark clouds engraved on its surface. Moisture was constantly condensing at the mouth of the urn, rippling slightly.</p><p>"Although it's a high-grade magical treasure, my cultivation level is too weak, I'm afraid they'll easily see through it," Tan Hao said with some worry.</p><p>"The purple streams of fire in the void will interfere with their vision and judgment. Besides, all we need is to distract them for a single breath, which is enough for me to do many things."</p><p>Qin Sang reassured him.</p><p>His plan was to use the anomalies in the herb garden to attract the attention of Old Devil Hunmo, while he would seize the treasure amidst the chaos and escape through the secret passage. However, how to shake off Old Devil Hunmo and the other pursuers after succeeding still needed careful consideration.</p><p>Tan Hao took a deep breath, solemnly instructing, "Brother Qin, be careful!"</p><p>"Don't worry, I won't risk my life, I'll only act if I'm sure of success. If things are impossible, we'll divide these spirit herbs and leave," Qin Sang smiled frankly, turned around and walked towards the secret passage.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet followed closely behind.</p><p>Tan Hao held the Misty Rain Urn in one hand, and a spirit talisman in the other, his mind tense.</p><p>Entering the secret passage, Qin Sang flew towards the one that led to the Golden Peak.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang's figure paused slightly, his expression grave as he looked ahead.</p><p>Familiar rays of red and gold light intertwined, filling the entire secret passage.</p><p>The terrain of Pure Sea Sect appeared in his mind. The secret passage bypassed the mountain pass, leading to the Golden Peak. Qin Sang knew that his current position was on the edge of that mountain pass.</p><p>The walls of the secret passage were part of the seal.</p><p>Seeing the seal up close, the scene was different from the '卍' seal outside.</p><p>The walls of the secret passage were dazzlingly red, the aura of red flames inside seemed about to burst out at any moment. On the surface of the walls, the power of the seal was manifested.</p><p>It was clear that the seal had two layers.</p><p>The outermost layer had countless tiny flowing '卍' characters, which was the Buddhist restriction.</p><p>The inner layer was a kind of restriction Qin Sang had never seen before, mysterious and complex. Qin Sang stared for a while, trying to comprehend it, and actually felt a dizzy sensation.</p><p>"It must be the work of an ancient great power."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, no longer wasting his mind on it.</p><p>At this moment, he noticed that there were something like cracks between the inner layers of the seal, and most of the Buddhist restriction's power was used to suppress these places.</p><p>Thinking of Tan Hao's words about the awakening of the demon, Qin Sang nodded slightly, roughly guessing what had happened back then.</p><p>He looked at the seals on the wall, pondered for a moment, and continued forward.</p><p>Soon, he came to the end of the secret passage, ahead was a stone door, tightly closed.</p><p>The surface of the stone door was flowing with Buddhist light.</p><p>The entire Golden Peak Grand Hall was sealed off by restrictions. The power of the restrictions was equally strong, and the secret passage was no exception.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see the scene inside the Grand Hall, but through Tan Hao's introduction, he already had a complete impression and clearly knew the locations of those magical treasures.</p><p>He first recalled the rules of the Golden Peak Grand Hall's restrictions that Tan Hao had mentioned, then raised his hand and gently touched the stone door, then made no further movements.</p><p>...</p><p>In front of the Golden Peak Grand Hall.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo and Feather Robe Yuanjun landed on the floor paved with gold bricks.</p><p>The Grand Hall was resplendent and magnificent, with a total of seven doors, three of which were ajar, but they could not be entered. The entire Grand Hall was covered with a layer of golden Buddhist light restrictions.</p><p>Through the cracks in the doors, they could see the scene inside the Grand Hall.</p><p>This was a Buddha Hall.</p><p>At the back of the hall was enshrined a golden Buddha, gorgeous and heavy. They were not Buddhist disciples, and could not tell which Buddha the statue was from legends.</p><p>On both sides of the Buddha statue stood two bhikkhu statues.</p><p>What was strange was that next to the Buddha statue, there was actually a human statue.</p><p>This person stood with his hands behind his back, with sword-like brows and star-like eyes, wearing a long robe, his clothes fluttering in the wind, standing on a square stone, as tall as the Buddha statue. Judging from his position, he seemed to be on par with the Buddha.</p><p>Seeing these statues in the Buddha Hall, Feather Robe Yuanjun's eyes revealed a look of doubt.</p><p>Too strange, the Buddhist sect had strict rules. The Pure Sea Sect actually enshrined someone outside the Buddhist sect in the Mahavira Hall . Could it be a lay Buddhist?</p><p>Feather Robe Yuanjun carefully examined it. It was just a stone statue, but she felt that this person had an extraordinary temperament, definitely not an ordinary person.</p><p>She thought of all the influential figures that had been passed down through the ages in the three realms of the North Sea, but none of them matched this person.</p><p>In her contemplation, Feather Robe Yuanjun didn't notice that a gleam of light flashed through Old Devil Hunmo's turbid eyes!</p>
