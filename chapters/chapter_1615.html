<h1>Chapter 1606: People</h1><p>Qing Jun and Bai had ascended to the Demon Realm!</p><p>Qin Sang still remembered their agreement at the foot of the Ascension Platform.</p><p>If he were fortunate enough to ascend in the future, they would still be separated by two realms. When could they meet again?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was somewhat downcast.  "What exactly happened in the ancient times?"</p><p>"I don't know! Not only was my cultivation sealed, but my memories were also sealed or erased.  All I remember are these insignificant things. I don't even know how much of these memories are true or false, or who sealed me and erased my memories. Only by returning can I find out my origins!"</p><p>The Ghost Mother's tone was desolate.</p><p>The memories the Ghost Mother considered insignificant were like treasures to Qin Sang.</p><p>She and Bai were similar, yet different.</p><p>Bai suffered a defeat on the battlefield, was sealed by a rogue ancient demon, his soul survived, his memories fading over endless years, potentially recovering when encountering familiar scenes.</p><p>The Ghost Mother's background seemed even more extraordinary, with many secrets surrounding her.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the Ghost Mother's feelings.</p><p>When he first came to this world, he also felt like a rootless duckweed. But he was a mortal then, immersed in the joy of being resurrected, only feeling sentimental when he thought of his family.</p><p>The Ghost Mother had a way to return, but he didn't even know where his home was.</p><p>Could it be some unknown small world?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts wandered, but he had no desire to search for his hometown or return to his native land. His parents and relatives were long gone; what was the point of going back?</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's wandering thoughts, the Ghost Mother continued to explain: "I learned about the Demon Lord's Altar, which allows ascension to the Demon Realm, from an ancient demon sealed beneath the Jinghai Sect. He was also a pitiful creature, like me, dazed and confused about his origins, attempting to devour my soul to survive."</p><p>Speaking of the ancient demon, the Ghost Mother laughed gleefully, "However, that demon's luck was even worse; he didn't have a chance to confirm if his cultivation was sealed. After sleeping for many years, he woke up to meet Xiao Xiangzi!"</p><p>"Indeed! Senior Xiao Xiangzi personally suppressed the ancient demon, leaving many countermeasures, finally killing the ancient demon with the power of the Jinghai Sect. Otherwise, if the ancient demon had escaped, the North Sea would have faced another demonic calamity!"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Xiao Xiangzi's arrangements in the Xuan Tian Palace and its sacred grounds, briefly describing them.</p><p>The Ghost Mother wasn't surprised at all, smiling and saying, "Xiao Xiangzi was frightened by the ancient demons of Central State!  He didn't realize that although these two ancient demons were not good things, they weren't likely from the same faction. After the Jinghai Sect's ancient demon escaped, it wouldn't stay in this realm for long; it would definitely try everything to find the Demon Lord's Altar and return to the Demon Realm."</p><p>There had been ancient demons wreaking havoc in the Central State.</p><p>After discovering fragments of the Demon-Binding Rope, Qin Sang had suspected this, but the clues were very few.</p><p>Of course, this was also related to him focusing on cultivation, only laying down some hidden moves and not yet starting a thorough investigation. The Ghost Mother, on the other hand, was focused on returning, fully investigating these matters.</p><p>"During Xiao Xiangzi's era, demons caused chaos in the Central State, resulting in a great calamity, but there was an invisible hand in the cultivation world deliberately erasing history, so it's almost unknown to the world today."</p><p>The Ghost Mother had indeed uncovered many secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred upon hearing this. Those with the ability to erase history were probably only the Eight Scenic Spots and Ganlu Zen Temple working together, or even top sects like the Tianhao Tower, the number one Demon sect, might have been involved.</p><p>He couldn't help but think of another existence that had almost been erased from history—the Wuxiang Immortal Sect!</p><p>What connection existed between the demonic chaos and the Wuxiang Immortal Sect?</p><p>The Ghost Mother nodded, "It seems you've also discovered some things. The demonic chaos could be said to have been caused by the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, which unintentionally released the ancient demons, causing the Southern Border to suffer greatly. In those days, the richest place in the Central State was not the Central Plains, but what is now the Southern Barbarian Two States. That demonic chaos not only led to the destruction of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, but also completely devastated the Southern Border, turning it into a desolate wasteland full of poisonous miasma and rarely visited by people!"</p><p>'Hiss…'</p><p>Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>Ancient demons possessed terrifying power, something he had experienced many times.</p><p>But to be able to destroy the vast Southern Barbarian Two States, which remain unrecovered to this day, what kind of terrifying war was it? It was definitely not something that Nascent Soul cultivators could accomplish!</p><p>"A battle of Transformation Stage cultivators?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The Ghost Mother said calmly, "It wasn't just a battle of Transformation Stage cultivators. The Witch Clan's Transformation Stage cultivator perished in that demonic chaos.  As far as I know, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was the undisputed overlord of the Central State at the time, far stronger than the current Eight Scenic Spots and Ganlu Zen Temple, with numerous Transformation Stage cultivators in the sect. After the demonic chaos, the entire sect was destroyed, and it's likely that all the Transformation Stage cultivators perished with the ancient demons! Otherwise, even if they couldn't regain their former glory, their legacy wouldn't have been completely severed."</p><p>"Could it be that someone took advantage of the chaos after the demonic incursion?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Water Lord's dying words in the tomb, filled with bitter resentment towards the Eight Scenic Spots and Ganlu Temple.  She wondered if the person was a Nascent Soul cultivator, or a successor after the fall of all Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Gui Mu glanced towards Hong City, where the masters of the two sects were currently located.</p><p>"The Wu Xiang Sect exerted all its strength to contain the demonic invasion in Nanjiang, preventing the entire Central Plains from suffering a demonic calamity.  They fulfilled their duty. The cultivation world is full of deceit and treachery.  It's not uncommon for someone to take advantage of the Wu Xiang Sect's weakness.  Whether the Daoist and Buddhist sects were involved, and how many participants rose to power by stepping on the corpses of the Wu Xiang Sect, is impossible to verify. However, one thing is certain: it wasn't glorious, and those who obscured history are undoubtedly connected to the perpetrators."</p><p>To the victor go the spoils.  If Senior Xiao Xiangzi was a descendant of the Wu Xiang Sect, the destruction of his sect, and being considered a thorn in the side of the Central Plains, forcing him to flee to the North Sea, makes sense.</p><p>He was ultimately a broad-minded person; upon discovering ancient demons in the North Sea, he didn't forget the common people and set a trap to suppress them.</p><p>But why did his letter make no mention of the Wu Xiang Sect? Was he heartbroken?</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>With the Wu Xiang Sect's destruction, the Witch Clan's Nascent Soul cultivator perished.</p><p>The ancient demon of the Central Plains certainly wasn't the level of the Jade Bone Demon.</p><p>Only if the Demon Lord himself, from the Seven Killing Hall, escaped imprisonment, could such a feat be possible.</p><p>Gui Mu had also mentioned that the ancient demon of Jinghai Sect and the Central Plains ancient demon weren't the same.</p><p>Do ancient demons have factions?  Are the Jinghai Sect's ancient demon and the Jade Bone Demon allied, while the Central Plains ancient demon and the Seven Killing Hall Demon Lord are another faction?  Or even worse, are their origins completely different?</p><p>"Where was the Central Plains ancient demon released from? Was it sealed after the demonic incursion, or was it slain?" Qin Sang had encountered three ancient demons.</p><p>Only the Jade Bone Demon was bound by the Soul Binding Rope and thrown into the spatial chaos to be destroyed.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi personally intervened, only managing to seal the Jinghai Sect demon, causing its true nature to be extinguished in death.  The Demon Lord is likely still sealed in the Seven Killing Hall, showing how difficult it is to kill ancient demons.</p><p>Gui Mu said, "Whether the ancient demons live or die isn't important; ultimately, the Wu Xiang Sect prevailed. The origins of the ancient demons are not simple. I only recently confirmed that they are from the South Sea Immortal Palace."</p><p>"The South Sea Immortal Palace?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed.</p><p>The South Sea Immortal Palace had always been a suspect. In the teachings of the Gu God Sect, it was described as a void paradise. She planned to have her clone interact with the Gu God Sect, but the clone's breakthrough had caused delays.</p><p>The Central Plains ancient demon originated from the South Sea Immortal Palace.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall imprisons the Demon Lord.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall, Heavenly Phase Hall, and Heavenly Same Hall all possess fragments of the killing sword.</p><p>The South Sea Immortal Palace is highly likely to be one of these two halls!</p><p>"The Witch Clan's Nascent Soul cultivator perished in the South Sea Immortal Palace. If you agree to let me take her away, I will guide you on how to enter the South Sea Immortal Palace and find her remains.  Her belongings will be yours!" Gui Mu reiterated the matter of Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang was still pondering the halls.</p><p>Could these halls be places used to seal demons?</p><p>"Senior doesn't know the origins of these halls? The Zi Wei Palace, the South Sea Immortal Palace…"</p><p>Gui Mu shook her head. "I know nothing about these halls. I even suspect they aren't from our era; otherwise, the differences between the ancient demons would be too great. Whether they predate us or postdate us is unknown. This is the most unique aspect of this world: enduring storms, eternal barriers, and too many things that defy logic."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a headache coming on. The more she knew, the more ignorant and insignificant she felt.</p><p>This world has experienced multiple cataclysms, leaving it in such a ruined state?</p><p>Gui Mu's words, though seemingly absurd, had evidence to support them.</p><p>The Zi Wei Palace is divided into inner and outer sections, with vastly different landscapes separated by a celestial barrier.</p><p>During ascension, only the celestial barrier of the inner palace changed, restoring its former grandeur and immortal splendor.  Qin Sang still vividly remembered the inner palace after the change.</p><p>The inner palace's celestial barrier was restored, but the outer palace remained unchanged, ultimately destroyed after the ascension in the inner palace.  The Abyssal Ruins and the Blood Lake were also affected.</p><p>The ascension platform is located in the outer palace and didn't change due to the Zi Wei Palace's ascension. It was artificially opened.</p><p>Could this be inferred?</p><p>The Jade Bone Demon, Gui Mu, the Jinghai Sect ancient demon, the ascension platform, the Abyssal Ruins, the Blood Lake, and the Zi Wei Palace outer palace arrived first, unrelated to the Zi Wei Palace.</p><p>Then, the true Zi Wei Palace descended from the heavens, landing near the outer palace.</p><p>Later generations, unaware, mistook them as one.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall and other immortal palaces clearly have a significant connection to the Zi Wei Palace, arriving together.</p><p>Because of this, the ancient demons in the Immortal Palace are far stronger than the Jade Bone Demon Lord; they are not of the same kind!</p><p>Qin Sang, since first entering the Purple Micro Palace, has gradually pieced together her experiences and discoveries, finally finding a somewhat reasonable explanation.</p><p>Seeing his silence, the Ghost Mother assumed Qin Sang found the price insufficient. Her gaze swept over him.  "What kind of spirit insect do you keep?"</p><p>Qin Sang pulled his thoughts back, remembering he was speaking to a master of insect cultivation.</p><p>In the Central Plains, none could match her skill in insect control.</p><p>Seeking instruction from the Ghost Mother on insect cultivation was already in Qin Sang's plan, but the Ghost Mother's shocking revelations had almost made him forget it.</p><p>He patted his spirit beast pouch, summoning the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>"A treasure-hunting centipede, early fourth transformation stage. Not bad,"</p><p>The Ghost Mother recognized the Fire Jade Centipede at a glance, her expression calm as she assessed it.</p><p>"Does this insect only have the ability to find treasure?"</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to know if it had other potential, ideally some combat ability.</p><p>Spirit insect paths are immutable; how does one guide their growth?</p><p>After a moment's thought, the Ghost Mother said: "The Fire Jade Centipede's potential can support it to the peak of the fourth transformation. If it were lucky enough to break through to the fifth transformation, that would be its limit. This is fate; unless it obtains a chance mutation, it's difficult to change."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>The path of spirit insects is far more difficult than that of humans.</p><p>The Ghost Mother smiled.  "Don't feel sorry for the spirit insect. Although spirit insects have low intelligence and single abilities, they don't have the tribulation of the forty-nine heavens; only the tribulation of transformation.  Furthermore, high-level spirit insects have long lifespans and possess powerful self-preservation abilities. Heaven has its own reckoning!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.  No wonder neither the Wu tribe nor human records mentioned spirit insects undergoing tribulations. Qin Sang had thought their heavenly tribulations were just far apart; he hadn't realized they were tribulation-free!</p><p>The Ghost Mother pointed to Qin Sang's dantian. "I'm not talking about this centipede, but your life-bound insect Gu. I can sense the aura of your life-bound insect Gu; I can't be fooled. Life-bound insect Gu are not unique to our tribe; other races also have this tradition. While there are differences, many borrow from our techniques, so I can certainly offer some guidance."</p><p>So she had already sensed the Sky Eye Butterfly's presence.</p><p>At this point, there was nothing left to hide.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>A hazy butterfly shadow flew from Qin Sang's dantian, gradually solidifying.  It gently fluttered its wings, landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, and lightly brushed his cheek, showing deep affection.</p><p>In front of the Ghost Mother, both the fat silkworm and the Fire Jade Centipede had performed poorly. Only the Sky Eye Butterfly behaved normally, perhaps because Qin Sang was there to support it.</p><p>Staring at the Sky Eye Butterfly for a while, the Ghost Mother uttered a surprised sound. "This is a Sky Eye Butterfly? It has undergone a mutation?"</p><p>After its mutation, the Sky Eye Butterfly's appearance had changed significantly, but its characteristic Sky Eyes remained.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, offering no explanation, much less allowing the Sky Eye Butterfly to demonstrate its ability to control tribulation thunder in front of the Ghost Mother.</p><p>The Ghost Mother was tactful, refraining from further questioning. Then, she discovered another surprising fact. "You practice our tribe's secret techniques?"</p><p>"I only know the techniques up to the Yuan Ying stage. After that, it becomes increasingly difficult.  It was only thanks to the Ascension Ritual from a senior in Hundred Flowers Valley that helped me advance a stage," Qin Sang explained truthfully.</p><p>The Ghost Mother continued to stare at Qin Sang, filled with wonder. "Human insect-control techniques are mostly derived from our tribe's, but they are inevitably selective and it's almost impossible to practice our complete secret techniques. Do you have some kind of special constitution? Perhaps you have some of our tribe's bloodline?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how to explain. "When I was young, I accidentally fell into Wu tribe territory and somehow ended up cultivating to this point. I don't feel anything special about myself."</p><p>"Different bodies, same tribe. Some Wu tribe members are unsuitable for cultivating life-bound insect Gu.  It's normal for a human to have such a special compatibility," the Ghost Mother warned Qin Sang. "You are not of our bloodline; the higher your cultivation, the greater the risk. If you rely on some external force, there will always be limits.  You must be cautious, and beware of the insect Gu backfiring."</p><p>"Thank you for your warning," Qin Sang thanked her, secretly wondering about the limits of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>The Ghost Mother paced back and forth, considering for a while.  "I can teach you the subsequent techniques of life-bound insect Gu, and it's far from ordinary Wu tribe secret arts. Also, in my memories, I once saw a seven-transformation Sky Eye Butterfly, named the Void Butterfly, which seems to have some connection to me. After I return, I will do my best to help you collect cultivation methods for the Sky Eye Butterfly. Even if it has undergone a mutation, there will surely be aspects worth learning from.  If you can't advance to the Nascent Soul stage and are trapped in this world, everything is pointless. If you can ascend, go to the Wu tribe territory and find us. I can't give you a precise location, but I will always act under the name 'Ghost Mother'."</p><p>A seven-transformation Void Butterfly – equivalent to the Unity Realm!</p><p>The Ghost Mother didn't believe Qin Sang wouldn't be tempted.</p><p>But…</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, looking at Ya Gu. "Senior, you may have misunderstood something. She is a living person, independent, not my possession."</p>
