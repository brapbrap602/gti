<h1>Chapter 2065: The Zhuyan</h1><p>The mirage vanished, and the scene ahead returned to a hazy fog, ending the debate. The lingering impression of a celestial palace within reach, ethereal and free, where a single step could lead to transcendence, remained etched in their minds. It was no wonder many of the 異人族 (Yi Ren Zu, Otherfolk) were so drawn to these mirages.  They even secretly hoped to encounter another, but to no avail.</p><p>After traveling through the fog tide for over a month, a blurry scene appeared ahead.  Overjoyed, the group charged forward with renewed vigor, only to find themselves still surrounded by whiteness. However, it wasn't fog, but snow.  The biting wind carried swirling goose feathers down, blanketing the world between sky and sea in a vast expanse. The sea had transformed into a snowy plain. Judging by the time, it should have been daylight, but the snow clouds cast a gloomy darkness upon the world.</p><p>“It’s said that the Hanhuang Kingdom wasn’t originally here, but deliberately migrated to this bitter, cold land…”  Jihong reached out a small hand, catching a snowflake. The fluffy white flake could have served as his blanket. Among them, he possessed the most extensive knowledge of the various Otherfolk tribes.  “Due to the climate, this sea region is in perpetual twilight, and the Hanhuang Kingdom’s territory is eternally covered in snow. But where others see a desolate wasteland, the Hanhuang Kingdom and their vassal tribes thrive…”</p><p>They chose a random direction and flew across the vast sea for a long time, finally sighting a piece of land. They encountered a vassal tribe of the Hanhuang Kingdom and, after receiving directions, finally reached the Hanhuang Kingdom's territory.</p><p>Calling it land was an overstatement; it was an ice sheet. There might have been earth and stone beneath the thick ice, but it was invisible to the naked eye.  The Hanhuang Kingdom only had three seasons: the Fog Year, the Snow Year, and the Wind Year. With the heavy snow subsiding, the icy wind grew fiercer each day. In the eyes of the Hanhuang people, the Snow Year was the best time.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others soon met the true Hanhuang people. Surprisingly, their height and features were indistinguishable from humans. The most significant differences were their blue hair, blue eyes, and skin so pale it was almost translucent, as if their bodies were composed of ice water.</p><p>They possessed an extraordinary ability to adapt to the cold. Even amidst swirling snow and howling north winds, ordinary people only needed to wear thin clothing woven from ice silk.  They lived in ice houses, traveled by sleds, cultivated crops that could grow in the snow, built cities from ice blocks, revered the snow and ice, and lived peaceful lives.</p><p>The magical powers of the Hanhuang cultivators were also related to ice and snow.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately thought of Liuli. If she were here, she would easily adapt, and might even gain insights from the Hanhuang people's techniques.</p><p>Walking within the ice city, Sunu observed the passing Hanhuang people and suggested, “How about we find a way to change our hair and eyes to blue and disguise ourselves as Hanhuang people?”</p><p>Silu considered this seriously.  “It could be worth a try, but the Hanhuang Kingdom’s magical powers are difficult to imitate. However, unless we engage in combat, minor flaws shouldn’t be a problem.”</p><p>Disguising themselves as Hanhuang people would certainly be more convenient than appearing as humans.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and said, “Once we reach the Hanhuang Kingdom’s capital, Sunu, you and Guya will stay behind and find a place to settle. Silu, Jihong, and I will scout ahead to the Zhuyan tribe.”</p><p>Guya let out a cry of dismay, anxiously asking, “Can’t we go with Senior?”</p><p>Her heart had long since flown back to the Storm Realm. She had thought she would soon return to her sect, and couldn’t bear the thought of being left behind.</p><p>“Having so many Otherfolk together is too conspicuous and might alert the Zhuyan tribe, which would be detrimental to our later actions. If we encounter any unexpected situations, it will also be easier for the three of us to escape. Once I find the Storm Realm, I will find a way to bring you all over…” Qin Sang explained.</p><p>The Jiaojiao tribe held a special position within the Heavenly Division. With Jihong accompanying them, many troubles could be avoided. Qin Sang decided to directly travel to the Zhuyan tribe via the Hanhuang Kingdom's teleportation formation.</p><p>However, with the addition of Sunu, three Void Refinement realm cultivators entering their territory would undoubtedly attract the attention of the Zhuyan tribe. After all, the Saint Tribe experts had all entered the Sacred Grounds, and the strongest individuals in each tribe were only at the Second Stage of the Empty Realm.</p><p>“Don't worry! I'll think of something. We’ll all transform into Hanhuang people, and maybe we won't need Brother Qin to come get us,” Sunu reassured them.</p><p>Having settled on this plan, they proceeded to the Hanhuang Kingdom's capital. After Sunu and the others had settled in, and Jihong had inquired about the various customs of the Hanhuang Kingdom, they bid farewell and headed towards the palace where the teleportation formation was located.</p><p>Officially, a First Stage Empty Realm cultivator was stationed there.  Seeing the three, he was slightly surprised.  Jihong sat on Silu's shoulder, and both Qin Sang and Silu concealed their faces with cloaks.</p><p>“I wonder when you arrived in our territory? Why is there no record in the palace?”</p><p>Jihong took charge of the conversation.  Despite his seemingly innocent appearance, he lied without blinking. “We strayed into the fog tide and accidentally stumbled upon your land.  We wish to borrow the teleportation formation to leave.  Our tribe has a prior agreement with yours, and we hope you can accommodate us.”</p><p>The guard hesitated.  He was aware of the agreement Jihong mentioned, which stipulated that whenever the Jiaojiao tribe found superior seeds in a particular location, they must first introduce them there, sharing the seeds with the local inhabitants.</p><p>Due to their unique abilities, the Jiaojiao tribe held a transcendent position, and no tribe wished to offend them.  Their arrival was generally met with a warm welcome, precisely because of this agreement. The Hanhuang Kingdom wasn't lacking in experts with similar skills, but they were still a notch below the Jiaojiao tribe.</p><p>"I wonder if you've found any superior seeds?" the guard asked.</p><p>“We are in a hurry to return and haven't had much time to search. If your tribe has any need, I can come back later to help you find some,” Jihong declared, patting his chest.</p><p>The Hanhuang Kingdom, as a superior tribe of the Heavenly Division, had deep roots and no urgent need for superior seeds, but befriending a Jiaojiao expert wasn't a bad thing.</p><p>The guard glanced outside, his heart already inclined to let them pass. The scrutiny of those leaving was less stringent than those entering, and there were no signs of anything amiss within the kingdom.</p><p>He was hesitating whether to consult the elder stationed there when a voice transmission reached him: “Let them go.”</p><p>The guard’s eyes flickered, and he waved his hand, opening the palace doors and gesturing them forward with a "Please."</p><p>Qin Sang and Silu detected subtle fluctuations, and their gazes pierced through their cloaks, fixed on the depths of the palace.</p><p>Silu transmitted, “Someone might have noticed something.”</p><p>“They might be suspicious, but they certainly can’t be sure of your identity. It seems they don’t want to delve deeper.  As we expected, unless the Hanhuang Kingdom has designs on Siyou, they wouldn’t forcibly keep you as a hidden pawn. Otherwise, you would only be a hot potato,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Silu nodded slightly.</p><p>With the Sacred Grounds above, the various tribes maintained a state of conflict without outright war.  Extermination within the Otherfolk was virtually unheard of. The Hanhuang Kingdom, moreover, was accustomed to their icy land. They didn't wish to leave, and others didn't wish to enter.</p><p>Interfering in the internal affairs of another tribe, especially another superior tribe, could very well trigger unforeseen consequences.</p><p>Light flashed before their eyes, and after the familiar sensation of whirling through space, they found themselves standing on another teleportation formation.</p><p>The three opened their eyes, seeing a high platform beneath their feet, surrounded by several vermillion pillars, but no roof overhead.  Strange peaks ringed the area, and several figures stood opposite the platform.</p><p>??????????.??????</p><p>Then, a strange laugh erupted. “Haha! Little thing, you dare return!”</p><p>One of them pointed at Jihong perched on Silu's shoulder, roaring with laughter that echoed through the mountains, incredibly jarring.</p><p>This individual had sharp features, but without a hint of slyness; rather, he possessed a certain martial air. His hair was a tangled mess like wild grass, and he wore a vermillion battle robe. His exposed hands were also crimson, and he gripped a red-gold staff tightly.  Had it not been for the staff supporting him, he would have fallen backward from laughing so heartily.</p><p>The others beside him also wore grins.</p><p>“It’s you!” Jihong immediately deflated, his cheeks puffing out in anger.</p><p>The last time he came to the Zhuyan tribe, this very person had been on guard.  He hadn't expected to run into him again so soon.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>The man finally managed to stop laughing, his gaze filled with amusement as he looked at Jihong.  “Little thing, did you bring reinforcements this time? It matters not!  No matter how many helpers you brought, Grandpa will take them all on!  As long as you can win a single match, Grandpa will make an agreement with you.  Except for our tribe’s forbidden grounds, you can go wherever you please, and I won’t ask a single question!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Silu had heard Jihong recount his previous encounter.</p><p>The Zhuyan tribe was inherently warlike, and once their temper flared, they wouldn't even care about the Heavenly King, let alone some ancient agreement.  It meant nothing to them.</p><p>This Zhuyan tribesman, upon seeing a member of the Jiaojiao tribe for the first time, had been overcome with excitement and insisted on engaging Jihong in a duel.  If Jihong could win, he would be allowed to search for superior seeds within the Zhuyan tribe.</p><p>The Jiaojiao tribe, in their travels, relied on various escape techniques.  Combat was their weakness. In a head-on confrontation, they were no match for the Zhuyan tribe.</p><p>After a humiliating defeat, Jihong had been forced to use his escape technique to flee the battlefield.</p><p>He had intended to reason with the Zhuyan tribe elders, but they avoided him. Moreover, during that period, other Zhuyan experts repeatedly sought him out, challenging him under the same conditions.</p><p>With nowhere to hide, and nearly exhausting his escape techniques, and facing the prospect of a real beating, Jihong had finally fled the Zhuyan tribe, still fuming about the experience.</p><p>“Wild monkey!  Let’s see how long you can remain arrogant!  I will reclaim my honor today!” Jihong shouted, hands on his hips, brimming with bravado.</p><p>The Zhuyan was slightly surprised, glancing at Qin Sang and Silu, but seeing nothing remarkable.  He sneered, twirling his staff, about to utter some harsh words.</p><p>Just then, a streak of light flew across the sky, abruptly changing direction above them.  A slightly aged, yet powerful voice boomed down.</p><p>“You rascal!  Stand down!  How dare you be disrespectful to our guests!”</p><p>The light converged, revealing a white-haired elder. His face was wrinkled, but his posture remained straight, his eyes sharp and compelling. Standing there, he was as imposing as a mountain, towering over the world.</p><p>Qin Sang and Silu were inwardly impressed.</p><p>The elder looked at Jihong and gave a slight bow.  “We failed to maintain order last time.  Please forgive us, young friend.”</p><p>Then his gaze shifted, landing on Qin Sang and Silu. He scrutinized them briefly, and his eyes suddenly flashed with intense light.  “Would the two of you care for a spar with me?”</p><p>Jihong’s face fell, and he sighed.  “Like father, like son!”</p><p>The Zhuyan tribesman who had just been reprimanded muttered under his breath, clearly disgruntled.</p><p>Silu stepped forward and bowed.  “I am Qu Lin. May I ask for your esteemed title?”</p><p>The elder seemed to have just remembered they were guests.  “My apologies! My apologies! I am Yuan Miao.  Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qu.”</p><p>Silu nodded, his tone softening.  “Fellow Daoist Jihong is a close friend of mine.  We are here to protect him as he gathers superior seeds and have no intention of causing conflict with your tribe.  You are aware of the Jiaojiao tribe’s abilities. Allowing him to search for superior seeds within your territory is mutually beneficial. We hope Fellow Daoist Yuan can accommodate us.”</p><p>“I am naturally aware of the Jiaojiao tribe's capabilities. However, our tribe has had no prior dealings with you, and you have arrived with so many experts. How do we know you don’t have ulterior motives?” Yuan Miao shook his head.</p><p>Hearing this forced justification, Qin Sang and Silu frowned.</p><p>Then Yuan Miao's eyes lit up.  “However, as the saying goes, ‘One becomes acquainted through combat.’ Fellow Daoist, spar with me. If you can defeat me, it will prove you have no sinister intentions. From then on, you are free to come and go as you please within our territory!”</p><p>What kind of logic was this?</p><p>Qin Sang and Silu were stunned, realizing this old monkey was simply looking for an excuse to fight them.</p><p>But judging by Yuan Miao's expression, refusing him would likely lead to further trouble.</p><p>“I have heard of the Zhuyan tribe’s love of combat, and it truly lives up to its reputation! But they are also easy to deal with. If you can defeat him, he will respect you and unlikely go back on his word,” Silu transmitted, sighing. “It seems a peaceful resolution is unlikely today. What are your thoughts, Fellow Daoist Qin?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently. Observing Yuan Miao's aura, although he was also at the early Second Stage of the Empty Realm, his Qi was profound, not comparable to someone like Silu who had just recently reached this realm. Moreover, the Zhuyan tribe was naturally combative, often using their staffs to settle disputes. Every member had extensive combat experience.</p><p>Silu was no match for Yuan Miao. Qin Sang would have to fight himself.</p><p>However, personally engaging carried the risk of exposing his identity.</p><p>Should they retreat and seek another path?</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you possess the ability to manifest wings. You can disguise yourself as a vassal tribe of the Feathered race. Although there will be a mixture of demonic Qi, as long as I insist you are a guard I recruited, there’s a chance we can fool them. Furthermore, my Heavenly Division superior tribe also has connections with the Eastern Sea aquatic races. Befriending demon cultivators is quite common.  In addition, I have something to say, I wonder if Fellow Daoist Qin is willing to listen?” Silu said.</p><p>Before this journey, they had communicated, and Silu knew some of Qin Sang's abilities.</p><p>“Please speak freely,” Qin Sang replied immediately.</p><p>“The place you seek is near the Zhuyan tribe’s territory. Once you find it, how do you plan to conduct yourself?  Can you truly remain hidden forever?</p><p>“Compared to other tribes, the Zhuyan tribe, with their temperament, is actually easier to get along with.</p><p>“As long as you can subdue them with your strength and request a place to stay, they might very well agree.</p><p>“This battle is inevitable sooner or later! Of course…” Silu suddenly smiled. “Once they recognize you as a worthy opponent, Fellow Daoist Qin, they might frequently come knocking for a challenge.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. Throughout this journey, his primary concern had been how to coexist with the nearby Otherfolk.</p><p>Silu's words had merit.  Encountering the Zhuyan tribe might be the best outcome.</p><p>However, to maintain the charade, it would be best to only use physical strength and techniques in this fight.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang stepped forward into the air, his aura rising steadily.  “Fellow Daoist Qu Lin’s injuries have not fully healed. I bear the responsibility of his protection. I will be the one to experience Fellow Daoist Yuan's magical powers!”</p>
