<h1>Chapter 1875: Swordsmanship</h1><p>“Since you put it that way, I’ll be bold and visit Master Zuo often.  Ah, as the saying goes, ‘familiarity breeds contempt,’ haha…”</p><p>Qin Sang said, chuckling to himself.</p><p>The Sword Master shook his head with a smile. “My friend, do you think Master Zuo favors you because of his connection with me?  The Grand Master has discerning eyes, how could he be swayed by outside influences?  Since Master Zuo is trying to cultivate a relationship with you, it only shows that your abilities are strong enough to earn the Grand Master's recognition and respect. Don’t belittle yourself.”</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip of wine, and said, “I won’t belittle myself, but it’s undeniable that being able to get to know Master Zuo, and having him willing to help me out of danger, is also thanks to you…”</p><p>Then, Qin Sang briefly described the battle seven years ago when he and Master Zuo fought the demon king together, objectively describing his own strength and contribution.</p><p>Before this, every time Qin Sang returned to Star Island's Immortal Lake, he hid his true cultivation.</p><p>After obtaining the *Poison God Scripture*, Qin Sang's cultivation speed was astonishing. He wasn't afraid of the Sword Master knowing, only that it would reach the Dao Court and attract unwanted attention.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the principle of "a tree that stands tall will invite the wind." As a lone cultivator, without any backing, he had to be cautious.</p><p>After the Altar incident, it was impossible to hide it any longer, but now his strength and background were vastly different.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that after the Altar Uprising, Master Zuo must have contacted the Sword Master to find out about him.</p><p>The Sword Master probably already knew.</p><p>Sure enough, after hearing Qin Sang's account, the Sword Master didn't show much surprise. He gently swirled the wine in his cup, feigning astonishment.  “They say ‘three days without seeing someone, one should look at them with new eyes.’ I've been in seclusion for a few years, and not only has the outside world changed drastically, but old friends have also soared to great heights, I almost didn't recognize you!  You have the ability to kill a demon king, so you must have mastered the Shadowless Sword and gained some insight into the Way of the Sword. Do you still remember our agreement from back then?  Why delay? The moonlight is just right, why don't we discuss the sword tonight?”</p><p>Qin Sang was helpless. The Sword Master clearly knew what he wanted to ask but pretended to be oblivious, evading the question. There must be some unspoken reason.</p><p>Since the Sword Master didn’t want to say, Qin Sang didn’t press further, finishing his wine. “To use my sword in front of you, I need some preparation. Can you give me another year?”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't forgotten his agreement with the Sword Master and had been eagerly anticipating it.</p><p>However, he currently lacked a suitable spirit sword.</p><p>The Gray Sparrow Sword wasn't high enough in grade, and the Cloud Wanderer Sword was still absorbing the King Kong Core, and it was estimated to be completed soon.</p><p>“Good, let’s set it for a year from now!”</p><p>The Sword Master nodded, drank a toast, picked up the wine pot, swirled it, and refilled both their cups.</p><p>Unknowingly, it was already late at night.</p><p>The two chatted, discussed the past and present, and parted happily.</p><p>…</p><p>Six months later.</p><p>In the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang was meditating with his eyes closed, when he suddenly sensed something, silently chanting the sword incantation. In an instant, the room was filled with sword light.</p><p>A gentle sword light hovered before Qin Sang, revealing the bright and clear Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>It looked much the same as before, except that the green light emanating from the spirit sword seemed a bit thicker.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could sense that the blade of the Cloud Wanderer Sword was now practically indestructible, thanks to the King Kong Core.</p><p>After giving birth to the spiritual embryo and advancing to a spirit treasure, the Cloud Wanderer Sword absorbed spiritual wood far faster than before.</p><p>Both King Kong Cores had been absorbed by the Cloud Wanderer Sword.  Counting from the day it started absorbing, it had been seven years, but the actual absorption time added up to only three years.</p><p>Between absorbing the two King Kong Cores, Qin Sang spent a few years understanding the changes brought about by the King Kong Cores.</p><p>Qin Sang kept his eyes closed, sensing his own spirit sword with his mind. After a while, he murmured, “So that’s it…”</p><p>After absorbing the first King Kong Core, Qin Sang discovered that the change in the spiritual embryo wasn't obvious.</p><p>The second one was the same.</p><p>It can be seen that absorbing spiritual wood only enhances the spirit sword itself, increasing its power, but it cannot speed up the transformation of the Cloud Wanderer Sword by piling up spiritual wood.</p><p>The key to the transformation of a spirit treasure into a postnatal spirit treasure lies in spirituality, the cultivation of a spirit within the spiritual embryo.</p><p>Qin Sang also learned this from Master Gu.</p><p>In cultivating spirituality, a spirit treasure and its owner cultivate together, their lives are intertwined, and it has advantages that other spirit treasures cannot match.</p><p>However, in order to keep the spirit treasure pure and prevent cracks from appearing between it and its owner, some refining techniques that forcefully accelerate spirituality cannot be used roughly on the spirit treasure, and must be carefully selected.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't learned many secret techniques and for now could only rely on nurturing his Yunyou Sword.  He opened his eyes; the Yunyou Sword subtly shifted, its edge pointed directly at Qin Sang's eyes.  At that moment, Qin Sang's pupils involuntarily constricted.  He felt the exceptional sharpness of the blade, a prickling sensation, and couldn't help but secretly admire it.</p><p>...</p><p>Half a year later, the appointed time arrived.  Star Island's North Lake region.</p><p>The area was eerily desolate. Cultivators scrambled into the inner lake to escape the calamity, some even relocating their entire sects, bringing along their affiliated families and commoners.  Those commoners with connections were fleeing south, while the rest were left to their fate.  Island after island had become deserted, though traces of past prosperity remained, now empty and lifeless.</p><p>Two figures flew on the wind – Qin Sang and the Sword Master. Their flight continued relentlessly north, further and further from human habitation, until only desolation met their eyes.  Reaching a vast expanse of water, the Sword Master descended, flicking out a sword-shaped energy that whooshed away and returned quickly. He nodded slightly.  "No one within a thousand li. Let's do it here."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang landed a thousand meters before the Sword Master, his feet on the water, rising and falling with the gentle waves.  The two exchanged a distant bow across the water.</p><p>Qin Sang made a sword gesture, a beam of sword light shooting from his brow, the sword energy like a dragon.  The sword energy stirred up towering waves in front of Qin Sang.  The Yunyou Sword circled above Qin Sang's head, transforming into a dazzling rainbow, soaring into the heavens.  Its cry echoed like thunder, shaking the four directions.</p><p>There were no islands or reefs nearby, but the water was teeming with life.  Even the most unawakened fish and shrimp instinctively felt terror at the sound of thunder and fled in schools.  The birds in the sky dared not fly over this area.</p><p>"Excellent sword!"</p><p>The Sword Master's gaze followed the Yunyou Sword, his eyes shining with admiration as he praised it loudly.  The next moment, he flicked his sleeve, a silver light shooting out, transforming into a three-foot-long blade, suspended before him.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the sword; it was the same one the Sword Master had used when they first met in the Star Valley cavern.  It had once been a pseudo-spiritual treasure, but now it was a true spiritual treasure.  Two ancient characters, 'Ask Heart,' were now inscribed on the blade.  However, Qin Sang knew this wasn't the Sword Master's strongest sword.</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked, "Why not use that sword?"</p><p>He referred to the sheathless spiritual sword in the Sword Master's cave, its entire body wrapped in white cloth strips inscribed with talismans.  The sight of that sword had left a deep impression on Qin Sang, sparking his curiosity about its true form.</p><p>The Sword Master understood what Qin Sang meant. "I cannot fully control that sword; I left it in my cave."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  Seeing that the 'Ask Heart' sword remained still, he didn't hesitate.  With a slight movement of his mind, a clear sword cry echoed from the heavens, piercing the air.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The sound of swords filled the heavens and earth.</p><p>The Sword Master looked up and saw countless sword energies obscuring the sky.  Sword shadows, seeming real and unreal, fell like rain, covering the entire water expanse.  The area had become a sword forest, with no place to hide.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, behold my sword!"</p><p>The Sword Master lightly called out.  The 'Ask Heart' sword trembled slightly, rotated, pointed towards the sky, and disappeared instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang showed a look of surprise.  The moment the 'Ask Heart' sword vanished, he lost his perception of it.  Only through his divine eye technique could he see a sword shadow rising against the myriad sword energies.  And the moment the sword shadow was about to collide with the sword energies, even his divine eye butterflies lost track of the 'Ask Heart' sword.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A sword cry, completely different from the Yunyou Sword, suddenly rang out.  The sound wasn't loud; compared to the roaring sword energies, it was faint, yet distinctly audible. At that moment, even the sword cries seemed to be suppressed by this single cry.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, golden sword lights suddenly appeared in mid-air, their number matching the descending sword energies, each point of golden light precisely corresponding to a sword energy.</p><p>The countless sword energies and sword lights collided almost simultaneously, like heaven and earth clashing.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Dark clouds gathered in the sky.  Giant waves rose in the lake.  Dazzling sword light erupted between the sky and water, transforming the area into a storm of light, obscuring everything. The figures of both men were swallowed by the light.</p><p>Two different yet equally powerful and terrifying sword intents swept across the area in an instant.  Fortunately, it was an open expanse of water; if it had been land, the power of the single blow might have shattered mountains and broken rivers!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was surrounded by chaotic sword intent; in his eyes and heart, there was only the sword.  He was about to change his tactic, when a sword cry echoed in his heart.</p><p>The "sword's hum" wasn't a real sound, but a supernatural ability Qin Sang cultivated through his understanding of the Chengying Sword.  As the saying goes, "The sword starts in the heart."  If he sensed killing intent directed at him, the sword would immediately warn him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an immediate warning and instantly recalled his Yunyou Sword.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A sword-rainbow descended from the sky, piercing the void beside Qin Sang.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A sword shadow was intercepted before it could strike, cut down by the Yunyou Sword. It was the Wenxin Sword.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>The Distant Swordsman nodded slightly and praised, seemingly understanding instantly why the Wenxin Sword was exposed.</p><p>The Wenxin Sword trembled slightly, its attack thwarted.  It didn't engage with the Yunyou Sword, instead retreating as a flash of light.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Wenxin Sword vanish, unable to comprehend how it appeared and disappeared silently beside him.  Understanding that prolonged engagement was disadvantageous, he didn't hesitate and immediately changed his sword technique.</p><p>The sword array deployed!</p><p>The sky darkened, then stars blazed, illuminating the heavens.  Sword stars hung in the air; the lake beneath them vanished.</p><p>They were drawn into the void, adrift in a river of stars.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang disappeared. His true form merged with a sword star, secretly dividing into seven sword spirits.</p><p>Each spirit entered a mansion of the asterisms, controlling one each, one person's power creating the sword array.</p><p>The Distant Swordsman remained motionless, allowing himself to be pulled into the array.</p><p>His position was precisely at the center of the array. He looked up at the sword stars, his gaze profound, as if calculating something.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't let him break the array and immediately activated it.</p><p>The Distant Swordsman stood in the area of the asterism Mao, which glowed brightly first. Beams of starlight rained down upon him.</p><p>Simultaneously, starlight flickered from the other six asterisms, striking from afar.</p><p>Starlight was sword light.</p><p>Locked by starlight and facing the formidable sword intent, the Distant Swordsman remained impassive. His Wenxin Sword vibrated violently, releasing an extremely powerful sword intent that shattered the incoming sword pressure.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The spiritual sword countered heaven!</p><p>The first beam of starlight collided with the Wenxin Sword, acting like a physical object—first halting, then shattering piece by piece.</p><p>The Distant Swordsman kept one hand behind his back, using the other to form a hand seal and point at the void.</p><p>The Wenxin Sword suddenly split into two, one real, one illusory, one bright, one dark, rotating around each other, faster and faster.</p><p>Ultimately, both Wenxin Swords vanished, replaced by a constantly spinning yin-yang symbol.</p><p>Sword intent transformed into yin and yang.</p><p>The following starlight, as it descended, seemed drawn by some force, falling into the yin-yang symbol.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Muffled sounds echoed continuously, the yin-yang symbol trembling violently but not collapsing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang sensed his sword array being subtly affected, secretly amazed.</p><p>Though only at the mid-stage of Transformation Deity, using the Yunyou Sword and the sword array, relying solely on swordsmanship, even late-stage Transformation Deity cultivators would have to be wary.</p><p>Even someone as strong as the Lingyou King, while not afraid of the Seven Mansions Sword Array, wouldn't find breaking it easy.</p><p>Yet, in a few breaths, the Distant Swordsman seemed to find a countermeasure.</p><p>His cultivation was the same as Qin Sang's, also at the mid-stage of Transformation Deity.</p><p>"Is the gap between us in swordsmanship really that large?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of inadequacy, but wasn't discouraged, as he hadn't unleashed the full power of his sword array yet.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Waves arose.</p><p>From outside the array, the entire water area was enveloped by an obscure energy, seemingly isolated from the world.</p><p>But it wasn't peaceful; continuous tremors emanated from within, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>The confrontation lasted an entire incense stick of time, the scene within the array unchanged.</p><p>The yin-yang symbol absorbed the stars, rotating endlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang had exhausted almost all variations of his sword array, unable to break it or injure the Distant Swordsman.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>Suddenly, the seven asterism stars resonated, an unprecedentedly rich starlight illuminating the star sea.</p><p>A ferocious beast was born in the star sea, formed from stellar煞, unleashing a thunderous roar and pouncing down!</p><p>"A Western sacred beast…"</p><p>For the first time, the Distant Swordsman showed a serious expression, murmuring in a voice Qin Sang could hear, "This array imitates the heavens and stars, incredibly profound.  It's a pity it only uses the seven Western mansions. If all the stars could be incorporated, with the Four Symbols, Three Enclosures, and Nine Luminaries shining together, it would be an unparalleled sword array!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. The Distant Swordsman seemed to have a hidden meaning, but he didn't have time to think it over.  He used all his strength to control the white tiger sacred beast, charging it towards the yin-yang symbol!</p><p></p>
