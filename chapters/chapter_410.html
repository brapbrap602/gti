<h1>Chapter 403: Igniting the Demonic Flame</h1><p>The Wuji Sect Master pointed his sword skyward. The spirit sword transformed into a streak of azure light, shooting upwards.  High in the air, it flashed, and an immense suction force emanated from the blade, drawing away the surrounding deadly wind, creating a vast void.</p><p>Immediately after, the spirit sword vanished into thin air.  Only a humming sound reverberated through the heavens, faintly suppressing the power of the Blackfrost Wind.</p><p>Was this the ultimate technique of the Shadowless Sword?</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, his eyes scanning the empty space where the sword had disappeared. He couldn't find a trace of it and had no idea where it was aimed.</p><p>At the same time as the Sect Master's attack, the other black-robed figure moved.</p><p>He raised a palm, gathering vast spiritual power, and struck the Black Tortoise Shell.</p><p>The spectral image of the Black Tortoise trembled. The shell within it suddenly surged with a dense black light, instantly filling the entire image.  At this moment, the tortoise seemed to come alive, like a true, ferocious beast.</p><p>A deep roar, no less powerful than the sword's hum, echoed across the land as the Black Tortoise raised its head.</p><p>Its giant eyes glowed crimson, glaring at the Thunder Swallowing Falcon.</p><p>Its body was pitch black, especially its shell, which resembled black iron. Its massive form appeared cumbersome, but it moved with surprising agility. In a flash, it crossed the void, appearing beside the falcon. It opened its massive jaws, sharp fangs aimed at the falcon's right wing.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>The Thunder Swallowing Falcon shrieked.  Silver light flickered on the feathers of its long neck, and lightning danced between them before converging on its wings.</p><p>Dyed silver, the wings transformed into a pair of enormous lightning wings.</p><p>Facing the tortoise's sudden attack, the falcon didn't flinch. Instead of dodging, it flapped its wings powerfully toward the tortoise.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The giant wings, now one with the lightning storm, lashed out like two thunder whips, striking the tortoise squarely.</p><p>The tortoise howled as its advance was halted, the lightning storm erupting within its body.</p><p>The falcon seized the opportunity, opening its beak wide and unleashing a massive pillar of lightning. The silver glow on its body momentarily dimmed.</p><p>For some unknown reason, the lightning pillar shot towards a seemingly empty point in the air before it.</p><p>The humming sound abruptly ceased. The lightning pillar transformed into a square cage of thunder, trapping a spirit sword within.</p><p>It was the Wuji Sect Master's sword!</p><p>His attack having been foreseen, the Sect Master could only control the sword, attempting to break free from the thunder prison.</p><p>The falcon’s ferocity was astonishing; it was simultaneously withstanding the attacks of two Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Without pause, its eyes flashed, and it suddenly fixed its gaze below. Then, with a powerful beat of its wings, it transformed into a bolt of lightning and shot downwards.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A figure, the black-robed man, was revealed, having somehow reached this position undetected.</p><p>He had moved stealthily, but the falcon’s lightning eyes saw through his concealment, and it used its lightning-fast dive to force him out of hiding.</p><p>The black-robed figure was sent tumbling backwards, but the falcon remained relentless. The lightning bolt turned sharply, continuing to pursue him.</p><p>Caught off guard by the falcon's ferocity, the black-robed man found himself in danger and retreated rapidly.</p><p>Seeing the perilous situation, the Wuji Sect Master, disregarding his trapped sword, rushed to his companion’s aid.</p><p>Together, they managed to halt the falcon's assault, but both were forced back.</p><p>The falcon shrieked at the two, issuing a warning.</p><p>Enraged at nearly being injured, the black-robed figure shouted something at the Sect Master and suddenly sat cross-legged in mid-air.</p><p>The Black Tortoise Shell hovered above. Following the black-robed man's hand seals, it began to divide: one into two, two into four…</p><p>Even Qin Sang could see that he was preparing a powerful technique. The falcon sensed the danger too.</p><p>It immediately beat its wings, unleashing a furious storm of lightning.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master positioned himself in front of his companion, recalling his sword. With a sweep of his hand across the blade, he formed a sword array, blocking the lightning storm while the black-robed man remained focused, unmoving.</p><p>In an instant, their roles had reversed.  The Sect Master, displaying a multitude of techniques, held the falcon at bay.</p><p>The battle raged in the distant sky. The deadly wind and snow obscured the view, and Qin Sang could only glimpse fragments of the fight.</p><p>The black-robed man had caught Qin Sang’s attention. Observing the constant changes in the Black Tortoise Shell, Qin Sang knew he was preparing something complex and powerful, something that would take time.</p><p>They didn't seem to be giving up!</p><p>Seeing this, a spark ignited within Qin Sang, rekindling a thought he’d previously dismissed.</p><p>This was his chance. Seeing the opportunity arise, Qin Sang acted.</p><p>Suppressing his aura, he moved down the icy mountain, staying within areas where the spiritual energy was most chaotic, and keeping himself hidden behind pillars of the Blackfrost Wind.</p><p>These pillars served as cover, preventing the Nascent Soul cultivators from detecting him.</p><p>The chasm was at the foot of the mountain.  The further down Qin Sang went, the closer he got to the deadly wind.</p><p>His nascent soul, protected by the jade Buddha, remained unharmed. However, his physical body began to feel the cold, and soon a bone-chilling frost permeated his being, nearly freezing him solid.</p><p>He had only just reached the edge of the chasm.</p><p>The Blackfrost Wind was terrifying. Without the jade Buddha, he wouldn’t have made it this far; his nascent soul would have been frozen by the emanating cold.</p><p>Even though he was immune to the most intense cold, the icy winds influenced by the deadly wind surpassed the protection offered by the Red Pellet.</p><p>Standing at the chasm's edge, Qin Sang felt his meridians freeze.  He squinted, peering down into the white abyss.</p><p>The falcon's nest might be further down, or perhaps there was nothing there at all, and he had guessed wrong.</p><p>His right hand clutched the Red Pellet tightly, his fingers numb.</p><p>Without the Red Pellet, he would have had to retreat. Descending further, even if he remained undetected by the two cultivators and the falcon, he would quickly freeze to death.</p><p>This pellet offered him a sliver of hope.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled a trace of spiritual power into the pellet. Igniting the Demonic Flame within would allow him to use its power to shield his body, at least until the flames burned out.</p><p>However, due to the Red Pellet’s unique nature, once the Demonic Flame was ignited, it couldn't be extinguished until it consumed the entire pellet, destroying it completely.</p><p>Destroying this treasure might yield nothing, a complete waste.</p><p>He didn't have time to dwell on it. The battle was volatile.  With little hesitation, he decided to channel his spiritual power, triggering the Demonic Flame within the Red Pellet.</p><p>The chaotic Demonic Flame erupted. The scene he had witnessed before repeated itself. The pellet melted, flowing flames covering its surface like a glaze.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to contain the flame’s aura.  However, the Blackfrost Wind stood directly in its path, readily extinguishing any escaping energy.</p><p>Holding the Red Pellet, Qin Sang's hands were scorching hot, but his body gradually warmed. The Demonic Flame was working!</p><p>However, as the flames burned, the Red Pellet melted layer by layer, growing smaller.</p><p>The pellet wouldn’t last long.</p><p>There was no time to lose. Qin Sang took a step, pressing against the icy wall, and began his descent.</p><p>Simultaneously, he deployed the Ten Yama Banners he'd previously stowed. The ghostly banners spun around him.  One hand clutched the burning Red Pellet, while the other gripped his magical tool.</p>
