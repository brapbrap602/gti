<h1>Chapter 837: The Siege</h1><p>“The island lords had an agreement. We've been trapped for so long, the others should have noticed something was wrong. Reinforcements should have arrived by now, but there's no sign of them… Something must have happened outside. The island lord senses danger and is prepared to abandon the island if necessary…”</p><p>Jin Ying had received detailed information from the Merchant Alliance. All the major factions were making urgent arrangements.</p><p>“The island lord poured a lot of effort into constructing the grand formation. Yuheng Island's protective formation is not only defensive, it can easily be transformed into a purely offensive killing formation with terrifying power. Unfortunately, after the transformation, the spirit formation can only be used once, unleashing its final brilliance. When the island lord activates the formation to annihilate the demonic beasts, that will be our best chance to break through…”</p><p>Jin Ying invited Qin Sang to escape with them. Qin Sang considered it briefly, then simply said he would try his best to meet up with them.</p><p>After all, no one could predict what the situation would be like at that time.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the two women off and sat in his cave dwelling, lost in thought.</p><p>He wondered how powerful the protective formation was. It would be best if it could wipe out the demonic beasts in one fell swoop, allowing them to escape directly.</p><p>More likely, there would still be a fierce battle. Escaping with the Merchant Alliance experts would provide strong support, but also make them more conspicuous, attracting the siege of powerful demons.</p><p>After cultivating the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, Qin Sang had a new idea he wanted to test during this opportunity.</p><p>Over the next few days, everything seemed normal. During his regular patrols and guard duty, Qin Sang observed carefully and found that the demonic beasts were indeed more active than before.</p><p>As time passed, they maintained contact. Jin Ying frequently sent messages, but the situation showed no improvement.</p><p>Half a month later, in the dead of night, the cultivators were startled awake. Rushing out of their caves, they saw dark clouds rolling in across the night sky.</p><p>Anger, fear, resolve, despair…</p><p>Various expressions appeared on the cultivators' faces.</p><p>The roars of beasts thundered across Yuheng Island, but the deep ringing of the warning bell could still be clearly heard.</p><p>Suddenly, daylight broke.</p><p>A giant protective barrier appeared, covering the entire city and the surrounding area.</p><p>The island's protective formation had been activated!</p><p>The formation couldn't cover the whole island. The outer areas were abandoned, and everyone retreated into the city.  The lush green mountains were quickly flattened by the overwhelming tide of demonic beasts. The cultivators felt the ground beneath their feet tremble violently, mirroring their own heartbeats.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The first collision occurred. A demonic beast slammed into the barrier and was instantly annihilated by the formation's power, its body torn apart, blood splattering across the sky.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, masses of flesh and blood exploded against the barrier, staining it crimson, turning it into a horrifying spectacle.</p><p>Apart from the roaring and the beastly cries, they could hear nothing else. The barrier emitted powerful spiritual energy fluctuations. As demonic beasts were annihilated, new ones immediately surged forward, seemingly endless.</p><p>In this situation, the barrier looked thin but was remarkably strong.</p><p>Without any prompting, the low-level cultivators in the city proactively summoned their magical artifacts, flew into the sky, and launched beams of light to strike down the demonic beasts outside the barrier.</p><p>The barrier shimmered brilliantly, while the artifacts and magical treasures emitted multicolored light, resembling stars.</p><p>Under the protection of the formation, the cultivators temporarily had no worries and focused on slaying their enemies.</p><p>Qin Sang was on patrol and was the first to notice the unusual activity of the demon race. The island had long been prepared for a demonic beast tide, and Qin Sang had his assigned duties.  Seeing the situation, he gave an order and led his squad members to the ground. Together, they activated a formation disk, assisting the Island Lord in maintaining the grand formation.</p><p>Qin Sang was tasked with guarding a corner of the formation, a heavy responsibility.</p><p>He dared not show any negligence.  A single lapse could allow the tide of beasts to tear open a gap and invade. They would be the first to bear the brunt of the attack.</p><p>The formation disk hovered above his head, resonating with the grand formation and other formation disks, consolidating the barrier and constructing a solid defense.</p><p>At the forefront were only minor demons. Although seemingly formidable, they posed little pressure for the time being. Qin Sang made proper arrangements, instructing his subordinates to regulate their breathing and prepare for the most dangerous moment to come.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the city guards, like Qin Sang, were reinforcing various points of the formation. Others were not idle, actively seeking opportunities to strike and kill demonic beasts, though their efforts were like a drop in the bucket in such a battle.</p><p>Bound together in fate, they would rise or fall as one.</p><p>Everyone understood this principle.</p><p>But soon they encountered resistance as the Demon Core Realm demons pressed forward.</p><p>These powerful demons had thick hides and tough flesh, capable of clashing with magical treasures with their physical bodies alone, withstanding the attacks. They blocked the cultivators' experts, allowing the lesser demons to assault the barrier, bringing the battlefield to a stalemate.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, observing the changes in the formation and the movements of the demon race.</p><p>His gaze occasionally drifted towards a large compound in the north. Jin Ying had informed him that the Merchant Alliance's forces were gathered there, preparing to break through from that point once the island was abandoned.</p><p>He should be able to reach them in time if he went there as soon as the island was abandoned.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang was slaughtering demons with his Ebony Sword, some figures moved within the horde. They lurked near the barrier, observing and sensing the surrounding auras, but rarely attacking.</p><p>Eventually, they gathered together, having found nothing.</p><p>“I haven’t sensed that person’s aura, nor seen a similar magical treasure. He must either be hiding and not attacking, or maintaining the formation, his aura concealed by the spirit array. Unless he takes action himself, it will be difficult to detect him.”</p><p>The demons shared their findings.</p><p>“He must be maintaining the formation!” The Leopard Demon paced restlessly on a hilltop, overlooking the city.  “That person’s cultivation is not weak. They wouldn't leave him unused. It seems we can only find him after breaking the formation. Keep attacking! Once the formation is broken, let’s see where he can hide! Also, he had a companion. Find his companion, and it will be the same!”</p><p>The Leopard Demon was determined not to stop until the city fell, ordering the other demons to attack relentlessly, regardless of the cost, sending wave after wave of their subordinates until the formation was broken.</p><p>The other demons, filled with apprehension, accepted the order and departed.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state.</p><p>He looked down at his hands. The two mid-grade spirit stones in his palms had turned pale white, their spiritual energy depleted. With a gentle rub, the stones crumbled into powder, flowing down between his fingers.</p><p>He looked up again at the demonic beast tide outside the barrier, still blotting out the sky.</p><p>“Five days!”  Qin Sang calculated silently.</p><p>For five whole days, the corpses of demons had piled up like mountains, blood flowing like rivers, yet the beast tide showed no signs of stopping.</p><p>He was at the forefront of the battle and had a clearer understanding.  The beast tide seemed chaotic, but it followed a certain pattern. There must be powerful demons directing it from behind.</p><p>The atmosphere in the city grew increasingly oppressive. The people sensed that this beast tide was unusual and were filled with worry, especially those who knew the inside story.</p><p>With contact with the outside world cut off and no reinforcements appearing, hope in that regard dwindled.  The ultimate fate of Yuheng Island now rested solely on the Island Lord's decision.</p><p></p>
