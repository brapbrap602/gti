<h1></h1><p>Nine Nether Geomagnetism is born from earth veins, flowing deep within the strata.  Even cultivators proficient in Earth遁 (Earth Evasion) wouldn't dare to delve too deeply into unfamiliar territories, recklessly traversing, for fear of accidentally stumbling upon a confluence of Nine Nether Geomagnetism and being captured by its power.</p><p>The Boundless Immortal Sect was clearly not simply channeling Nine Nether Geomagnetism.  The successive explosions of the Sword Stars and Star Pavilions demonstrated the violent nature of the Geomagnetic power within the Earth Walking Divine Restriction, no less dangerous than the Sunfire Divine Restriction and the Seven Constellations Sword Formation.</p><p>The explosion of the bright star was truly like the tearing apart of a celestial body.  Two dazzling spheres of light appeared in succession within the Nine Nether Geomagnetism.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was drawn to the second sphere of light.  The first bright star was a normal Sword Star, but this one was different—it was a Star Pavilion.</p><p>He had previously speculated that the Five Elements Divine Restrictions and the outer mist tide together formed the protective formation of Emperor Bestowal Mountain. However, his encounters after entering, as well as some signs within the Divine Restrictions, gave him a different feeling.</p><p>Placing a Star Pavilion within the sword formation puzzled him even more.  Could it be prepared for the Boundless Immortal Sect's sword cultivators to seclude themselves and comprehend sword intent?</p><p>As his thoughts flickered, Qin Sang witnessed the entire explosion of the Star Pavilion. First, the starlight was torn and distorted by the magnetic force.</p><p>The four swords hanging from the upper level of the Star Pavilion reacted instantly. Four prominent sword lights could be seen within the sphere of light, like four pillars, attempting to protect the Star Pavilion.  However, they too quickly became distorted.</p><p>Detached from the Seven Constellations Sword Formation, these sword intents became rootless duckweed. In their confrontation with the Geomagnetic power, their own strength could only be depleted, not replenished.</p><p>The sword intents of the four hanging swords were formidable, instinctively resisting for a while.  However, the residual wave from the explosion of the first Sword Star swept over, instantly shattering one of the hanging swords.</p><p>The other three swords didn't last much longer. The power within the Star Pavilion lost its balance.  Losing the support of the sword intent, the Star Pavilion exploded almost simultaneously with the last hanging sword, shattering into pieces!</p><p>It was truly a dazzling spectacle.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently, his eyes fixed on the fragments of the Star Pavilion.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly, a flicker of surprise crossing his face. A human figure appeared among the debris.</p><p>It was a female cultivator, dressed in a green robe, with a sword at her side, possessing an extraordinary air.  One glance revealed her to be a peerless sword cultivator. Judging by her vivid features, she was clearly a living person!</p><p>With the Boundless Immortal Sect sealed for so long, the sudden appearance of a living person delivered a considerable shock to any observer.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to take a closer look when the female cultivator's expression suddenly became狰狞 (fierce and distorted). Her limbs twisted grotesquely.  He paused, realizing it was the effect of the Geomagnetic power.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the female cultivator's body exploded with a 'bang,' following the fate of the Star Pavilion.</p><p>"Not a living person!"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind eased slightly.</p><p>Except for ancient demons, Bai, and the Ghost Mother, those special existences from ancient times, Qin Sang had never seen anyone live so long. Upon seeing the female cultivator, he had been on high alert.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only a corpse.</p><p>Even so, the corpse was extraordinary.  Shredded by the Geomagnetic power, it didn't turn into dust. Bone fragments remained, as hard as metal and stone.  A few points of precious light appeared alongside the corpse, even more eye-catching than the broken bones.</p><p>Noticing these points of light, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  As expected, this woman should be a cultivator of the Boundless Immortal Sect.  For some unknown reason, she hadn't escaped and perished here.  Those points of light were likely her belongings.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang immediately changed his mind and darted towards the Nine Nether Geomagnetism.</p><p>The treasures were secondary.  The woman's identity and the information contained within her belongings were what Qin Sang valued most.</p><p>He had only just entered the formation, not yet seeing the shadow of the Wordless Jade Tablet, and the Five Elements Divine Restriction blocking the way was already this formidable. He didn't know how many more difficult obstacles lay ahead.</p><p>If he could find useful information from the belongings, he would gain an advantage.</p><p>In another direction, Su Zinan and the others, like Qin Sang, had witnessed the entire event.  They were all decisive individuals.  Seeing the corpse and the belongings, they made the same choice as Qin Sang.</p><p>As the three groups rushed forward, the fragments of the Star Pavilion collided with the debris of the first Sword Star, converging into a chaotic torrent. Drawn by the Geomagnetic force, they drifted towards the depths of the Nine Nether Geomagnetism.</p><p>At the same time, the two Sword Stars that had seemingly escaped were drawn back in due to the distortion of the Geomagnetic power caused by the Star Pavilion's explosion, following a chain reaction. Perhaps because the preceding debris had blocked the most violent wave of the Geomagnetic impact, they didn't explode immediately.</p><p>The attractive force of the Geomagnetic power was powerful, and the torrent and Sword Stars drifted at an extremely high speed.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the boundary between the sword formation and the Nine Nether Geomagnetism. His figure paused slightly, a contemplative look on his face as he glanced towards the distance.</p><p>Just now, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had warned him of fluctuations in the Nine Nether Geomagnetism to his right, possibly triggered by someone. It was understandable; anyone within the sword formation would undoubtedly be drawn to the bright stars.</p><p>However, the other party was a step ahead of him.  Previously, his view had been obstructed by the enormous Sword Star, preventing him from seeing them.</p><p>Clearly, the other party was also after the female cultivator's belongings.</p><p>He wasn't sure about the other party's background, but Qin Sang had no intention of retreating.  Who would claim the prize remained to be seen.</p><p>The Geomagnetic power, however, was a problem.  Nine Nether Geomagnetism greatly suppressed Five Elements treasures.  This was his first encounter with a Divine Restriction fused with Nine Nether Geomagnetism, and he didn't know how much of his strength he could exert within it.</p><p>Having experienced the Sunfire Divine Restriction and the Seven Constellations Sword Formation, the intensity of the Geomagnetic power shouldn't be much stronger. This suppression must also have its limits.</p><p>Qin Sang took a step forward, coming into contact with the Nine Nether Geomagnetism. He immediately felt his body grow heavy, locked onto by a powerful suction force, involuntarily pulled several zhang inward.  Simultaneously, he felt a sensation of being torn apart by the Geomagnetic power.</p><p>With a thought, Nine Nether Demonic Fire surged into the Mani Pearl. The罡火罩 (罡 Fire Shield) vibrated with a 'hum,' black flames flickering on its surface, resisting the Nine Nether Geomagnetism.  Qin Sang's figure swayed but he forcibly steadied himself.</p><p>He looked at the罡 Fire Shield around him, a hint of joy appearing in his eyes.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was the primary source of the罡 Fire Shield's power. However, after being transformed by the Mani Pearl, the nature of the罡 Fire Shield was no longer entirely that of spiritual fire, forming a special kind of protective罡.</p><p>Through this transformation, with the protection of the罡 Fire Shield, although Qin Sang couldn't move freely, he was far less affected than others.</p><p>With a silent smile, Qin Sang flapped his Phoenix Wings, pursuing closely.</p><p>When Qin Sang entered, Su Zinan's group was already within the Nine Nether Geomagnetism.</p><p>However, the two groups maintained their distance, separated to either side by the suction of the Geomagnetic radiance after entering the Nine Nether Geomagnetism.</p><p>Neither side showed any intention of joining forces.</p><p>Previously, both groups wanted to quickly break the sword formation. With a shared goal, they could temporarily cooperate. But once they entered the core of the sword formation, found the method to break it, and then encountered the appearance of a rare treasure, this temporary alliance was difficult to maintain.</p><p>Both sides were top-tier experts, wary of each other, and tacitly separated by the Geomagnetic power.</p><p>The Poison King was still with Master Huaiyin.</p><p>However, this time, Master Huaiyin was in the lead.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's aura had drastically changed.</p><p>Previously, he had been reserved and calm, speaking little, like a follower of the Poison King. If not for the vigorous qi and blood within his body revealing his extraordinary nature, he would have been easily overlooked.</p><p>Now, Master Huaiyin's entire body shimmered with golden light, his skin as if plated with gold foil, clearly having activated some kind of Buddhist Golden Body technique.</p><p>Even more astonishingly, his qi and blood churned, steaming around his body, his blood essence like mercury, transformed into a golden hue, as if bathed in Buddha light.</p><p>The Nine Nether Geomagnetic radiance bent and even bounced off upon contact with his Golden Body.  Master Huaiyin strode forward with powerful steps, like a golden Arhat!</p><p>His Buddha eyes were sharp, locked onto the torrent of fragments. His steps were heavy, each one deliberate, yet seemingly slow but actually fast.  It was unclear what kind of movement technique he was using.</p><p>The Dao is simple, yet profoundly effective.</p><p>The Poison King followed closely behind, yet found it somewhat strenuous.</p><p>Master Huaiyin was a body cultivator, relying on no external objects. He could remain unperturbed even within the Nine Nether Geomagnetism. However, many of the Poison King's magical treasures were unusable here.</p><p>The Poison King had no choice but to summon his poison cloud again, merging himself within it.</p><p>The outer edges of the poison cloud churned restlessly, constantly being torn by the Nine Nether Geomagnetism. Each layer consumed was replenished with new poison cloud, so there was no need to worry about it being breached in the short term.</p><p>"What has made Master so eager?"</p><p>The Poison King called out, filled with puzzlement.  This was the first time he'd seen Master Huaiyin lose his composure.</p><p>"Amitabha."</p><p>Master Huaiyin's steps didn't stop, his voice booming, "This poor monk just saw a Xin Metal Source Crystal! This treasure is something this poor monk must obtain, having searched for it for many years."</p><p>On the other side, the same four words also surfaced in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>"Xin Metal Source Crystal!"</p><p>As the Star Pavilion disintegrated, a few points of precious light flashed.  In a fleeting glance, Qin Sang noticed a golden pearl the size of a dragon's eye. It seemed familiar. After a brief recollection, he remembered the name of this treasure—the rare Xin Metal Source Crystal.</p><p>Xin Metal is Yin Metal, the counterpart to Geng Metal, naturally existing in the form of small golden pearls.</p><p>However, Xin Metal is warm, soft, and lustrous, with a malleable texture, easily reshaped with a little force.  Just now, when the Xin Metal Source Crystal flew out of the Star Pavilion and encountered the Geomagnetic power, it was pulled out of shape. If not for its inherent special qualities, being soft on the outside but firm within, it would likely have been torn apart on the spot.</p><p>This further confirmed Qin Sang's judgment.</p><p>Geng Metal is an exceptionally precious spiritual material, extremely hard and robust, the perfect choice for refining spiritual swords.</p><p>Xin Metal Source Crystal can certainly be used for refining tools, but that's not its best use.  Its true value lies in healing injuries.</p><p>It's said that if the physical body suffers severe injuries, even on the verge of disintegration, refining and absorbing a Xin Metal Source Crystal can repair the body and bring about rapid recovery.</p><p>It's also said that body cultivators can gain considerable benefits from refining Xin Metal.</p><p>Qin Sang had read these secrets in body cultivation related classics.</p><p>He also cultivated his physical body and had always paid attention to collecting such classics. Although he cultivated demonic techniques, he could still draw inferences by analogy. Unfortunately, he lacked a complete inheritance, and the classics were vague about the so-called 'benefits.'</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know, but Master Huaiyin knew very well.</p><p>By refining and absorbing a Xin Metal Source Crystal, the body cultivator's physical body would gain a certain degree of suppleness, which is highly beneficial in battles and conflicts.</p><p>However, for Master Huaiyin, the reason why the Xin Metal Source Crystal was a must-have was for another purpose.</p><p>There was a secret technique in the temple that required a Xin Metal Source Crystal to cultivate.</p><p>Legend has it that from the Wuji (Primordial Chaos) to the birth of the world, it went through five stages of the Primordial Five Eras, giving rise to tangible matter, then to the initial division of Yin and Yang, evolving all things. Various primordial qi roamed within the heavens and earth, drifting without a fixed location.</p><p>Geng Metal Qi was the same.</p><p>When Geng Metal Qi accumulated to a certain extent, it would condense into Geng Metal. Otherwise, it would continue to flow within the world.</p><p>However, compared to the boundless heavens and earth, this Geng Metal Qi was too thin. Cultivators couldn't sense it, let alone collect it.</p><p>By cultivating this technique, one could refine the Xin Metal Source Crystal into their bone marrow, then utilize the principle of Yin and Yang attraction to draw the world's free-flowing Geng Metal Qi into the body through the Xin Metal Source Crystal.</p><p>Geng Metal is extremely hard and robust.  Using it to temper the entire skeleton, one could cultivate to the point where their bones transform into Geng Metal.</p><p>At that time, shattering magical treasures with a fist would be effortless.</p><p>This secret technique held extraordinary significance for Master Huaiyin's path of cultivation. Unfortunately, Xin Metal Source Crystal was even rarer than Geng Metal, rarely appearing even in the Central Continent. Throughout the history of the temple, only a handful of Saint Monks had encountered such an opportunity.</p><p>After entering the Boundless Immortal Sect, Master Huaiyin initially hadn't held much hope of gaining anything.  Unexpectedly, he discovered a Xin Metal Source Crystal here.  He couldn't miss this opportunity no matter what.</p><p>After hearing Master Huaiyin briefly explain the reason, the Poison King knew he was determined to obtain the Xin Metal Source Crystal and unhesitatingly agreed to assist him with all his might.</p><p>As they spoke, everyone chased after the fragments of the Star Pavilion, entering the depths of the Nine Nether Geomagnetism.</p><p>At this moment, the two Sword Stars behind finally couldn't hold on any longer. Their sword intent surged, and they exploded together!</p><p>These two Sword Stars were pulled together by the Nine Nether Geomagnetism, exploding simultaneously. The resulting power wasn't simply additive, far surpassing the previous single-star explosion in scale.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A blinding light erupted within the Nine Nether Geomagnetic radiance, like a great sun hanging in the sky, swallowing the torrent of debris.</p><p>In an instant, centered around the Sword Stars, the surrounding Nine Nether Geomagnetic radiance became turbulent.</p><p>The Geomagnetic power in that area became violent, the danger level instantly increasing by more than a single degree.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly. Seeing this, he didn't hesitate for long.  He poured all the spiritual fire from his Fire Lotus into the Mani Pearl, further thickening the罡 Fire Shield, and then charged straight into the chaos.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Master Huaiyin and the Poison King were also forced to stop.</p><p>The Poison King was secretly alarmed.  He hadn't realized it from afar, but upon approaching, he felt the sheer power of the Sword Star explosion.</p><p>Sensing the violent Geomagnetic power within, the Poison King hesitated.  Then, he heard the bones within Master Huaiyin's body crackle, his blood essence surging, a layer of golden light flowing over his skin as the Buddha light around him intensified.</p><p>This was the manifestation of dense qi and blood.</p><p>Next, under the Poison King's astonished gaze, the qi and blood transformed into a golden dragon, coiling around Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin held the Heavenly Dragon aloft.  The dragon roared, and the Nine Nether Geomagnetic radiance couldn't approach him at all.  He didn't wait for the Poison King, but strode towards the center of the chaos without fear, disappearing into the starlight in a blink of an eye.</p><p>The Poison King couldn't manage it as easily as Master Huaiyin and could only slow down, proceeding cautiously.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao were not far from them, their speeds similar.  However, separated by the omnipresent Nine Nether Geomagnetism, they could only vaguely sense each other's presence.</p><p>As the Sword Stars exploded, Su Zinan narrowed his eyes, observing, but his figure didn't pause.</p><p>Mo Xingdao approached, frowned, and like the Poison King, slowed down and stopped.</p><p>Su Zinan nodded at him and continued forward, the Dragon Sine Net above his head humming, seemingly reaching its limit, about to break at any moment.</p><p>Once outside Mo Xingdao's perception, Su Zinan secretly summoned the Demonic Banner.  Two demonic shadows, Old Wu and Old Yan Shan, materialized before him, then turned ethereal and plunged into Su Zinan's body.</p><p>Su Zinan's face flushed. He withdrew the Dragon Sine Net and was actually able to stand firm!</p>
