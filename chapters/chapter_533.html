<h1>Chapter 526:  The Qiyang Strongman</h1><p>Chapter 526:  The Qiyang Strongman</p><p>Pill Formation Stage!</p><p>After the flames vanished, Qin Sang sprang from the bushes, his eyes flashing. Without hesitation, he activated his movement technique and stealthily headed towards Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>The Qiyang Sect's Pill Formation Stage cultivator was his only concern. With this person already gone, Qin Sang didn't worry about being easily discovered.  He didn't wait for others to depart before beginning his infiltration towards Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>He needed to save as much time as possible!</p><p>With the speed and escape techniques of a Pill Formation cultivator, the journey from the Qiyang Sect to the Wuyaya Valley, and then into its second layer, wouldn't take more than two hours, at most.</p><p>The demonic beasts and spirits of the Wuyaya Valley's first layer wouldn't impede his progress.</p><p>Beforehand, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had agreed that Yun Youzi would retreat immediately after succeeding, avoiding lingering. Even with his strength, he couldn't possibly contend with the entire sect.</p><p>They had meticulously planned every detail.</p><p>This sudden beast tide might buy Qin Sang some extra time.</p><p>Going back and forth, even including the time spent rescuing people…</p><p>Qin Sang decided to set a four-hour limit. He absolutely had to complete the secret technique and leave the Qiyang Sect within four hours!</p><p>"Four hours, barring any unforeseen circumstances, should be enough…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused to himself.</p><p>As he drew closer to Shen Gang Peak, Qin Sang suddenly froze, darting behind a boulder.  Several figures then burst from the green mist, racing down the mountain.</p><p>One of them summoned a boat—long and slender, like a bean pod, with pointed ends and layers of green flames dancing on its surface.</p><p>The boat expanded as it caught the wind, and the figures eagerly boarded.</p><p>A short while later, two more arrived.</p><p>At that moment, the boat erupted in flames, trembled slightly, and transformed into a streak of light soaring into the sky. Its speed was astonishing, only slightly slower than that of a Pill Formation cultivator's escape technique.</p><p>Qin Sang surmised that the boat's incredible speed was likely due to the combined efforts of its occupants.</p><p>These were turbulent times.  Qiyang Sect disciples had been dispatched to various locations, leaving only a handful of powerful cultivators behind.  These probably weren't all of them, but close to it!</p><p>After watching them leave, Qin Sang had no more reason to hesitate.</p><p>…</p><p>Qiyang Sect mountain gate.</p><p>The boat arrived suddenly and was about to depart when it abruptly stopped before the stone stele.</p><p>An undeniable command echoed from within, “Fellow disciples, with our departure, the sect will be vulnerable.  Temporarily seal the mountain gate; no one is permitted to enter or exit!”</p><p>Eight cultivators, all at the Foundation Establishment stage, sat cross-legged around the stele.</p><p>Hearing this, a black-robed elder replied, "Brother Li, rest assured.  Uncle Wu gave us the same instructions before leaving. After your departure, we'll immediately activate the protective formation, leaving no opportunity for intruders! Oh, right…"</p><p>The black-robed elder seemed to recall something, hastily retrieving a jade slip from his bosom and tossing it towards the boat. "A report from the Wuyaya Valley has arrived. There's indeed a beast tide. Uncle Wu instructed you to proceed directly to the location specified in the jade slip to rescue people after entering the valley; no need to meet up with him first."</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>A shadowy hand suddenly extended from the boat, seizing the jade slip and retracting it.</p><p>The boat trembled slightly, then shot towards the east with a whoosh.</p><p>After their departure, the black-robed elder surveyed his surroundings and declared, "Fellow disciples, activate the formation!"</p><p>"Activate!"</p><p>"Activate!"</p><p>…</p><p>With resounding shouts, the eight people formed a circle, simultaneously placing their hands on the stone stele before them.</p><p>As their spiritual energy continuously flowed into it, the stele seemed to be cleansed, gradually transforming into a transparent jade stele.  The characters ‘Qiyang’ on it blazed with dazzling light.</p><p>Due to the unusual phenomenon, the mountains on either side suddenly became turbulent with wind and clouds, eventually completely sealing off the Qiyang Sect, including the stone stele and the eight cultivators, who were hidden within the cloud sea.</p><p>For other disciples, the closure of the mountain gate, aside from restricting entry and exit, had no significant impact.  Seeing no major enemy attack, they remained calm, continuing their cultivation as usual.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang infiltrated Shen Gang Peak!</p><p>Upon entering Shen Gang Peak, Qin Sang realized the extent of the chaotic spiritual energy.  No wonder there were no restrictions or formations around this mountain; it was impossible to maintain them.</p><p>His figure silently appeared before a stone pillar, shaped like a withered ancient tree with branches spreading outwards from its top.</p><p>Qin Sang tilted her head, examining the green "lanterns" hanging from the branches.  Shi Ying had brought back refined Qingyang Divine Energy; this was Qin Sang's first time seeing it, and she found it quite novel.</p><p>It looked like wisps of light, yet it held its form, clinging firmly to the branches.  Even up close, she sensed no fluctuation.</p><p>Not far from Qin Sang, a Qi Condensation stage disciple was absorbing the Qingyang Divine Energy, oblivious to her observation. Qin Sang silently approached the disciple, watching his actions.</p><p>The disciple channeled his inner Qingyang Demonic Fire, gently touching a wisp of the energy. He made dozens of hand seals.  His Qingyang Demonic Fire noticeably grew stronger, seemingly nourished by the energy.</p><p>However, the previously docile flames suddenly became violent.</p><p>The disciple, clearly experienced with this, didn't panic. He focused his spiritual energy, suppressing the unruly flames, then returned to his cave for cultivation.</p><p>Watching the disciple leave, Qin Sang shook her head. She didn't cultivate the Qingyang Demonic Fire, so she couldn't directly absorb the purest Qingyang Divine Energy like them.</p><p>Scanning her surroundings, Qin Sang found a rather well-hidden wisp.</p><p>Standing before it, Qin Sang slowly closed her eyes, cautiously extending her right hand while using her spiritual sense to detect every change.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang opened her eyes, staring at the energy with a furrowed brow.</p><p>Now she understood why the energy at the mountain base was in that form.  She discovered the energy wasn't pure enough. To use it for cultivation, she'd have to refine out the impurities to obtain pure energy.</p><p>Refining the impurities wasn't difficult; Qin Sang had already devised a method, but it would take time.  The Qingyang Divine Energy was very unstable and could dissipate at the slightest mishap!</p><p>She had limited time and couldn't waste it on this.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled some information she had gathered: Qingyang Divine Energy existed in various forms, and the purity of the energy within likely varied depending on the form.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang hesitated no longer, activating her movement technique and swiftly heading towards the mountaintop.</p><p>As expected, the closer she got to the summit, the denser and purer the Qingyang Divine Energy became. Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy, and she increased her speed.</p>
