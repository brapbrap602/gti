<h1>Chapter 1718: First Test of the Sword Formation</h1><p>The armored man was Zishen the Great Sage.  The situation was irreversible; the Great Sages and Demon Kings fled, each one faster than the last.  Zishen's kin were not present, giving him free rein to depart. Cultivators of their level didn't worry about their safety. Even with the disastrous defeat of the Saint King's Palace, the major clans wouldn't push them to their deaths.  Unless they could guarantee a flawless kill, no major clan wanted to face the wrath of a Great Sage's revenge.</p><p>After this battle, the Saint King's Palace changing hands was a foregone conclusion. Zishen felt regret; their greatest loss was forfeiting their share of the sacred land. However, for many years, the Saint King's Palace had dominated the various clans of the Eastern Sea.  Having followed the Azure Fox Saint King, they had already reaped rich rewards. It was time to return to their caves for seclusion.  If necessary, they could still be welcomed as honored guests by some major clan upon their return.  The Eastern Sea had always been like this—one generation fades, another rises. A period of dormancy, and a new world awaits.</p><p>As a defeated general, Zishen remained composed and showed no anger.  He was making plans when his whereabouts were suddenly exposed. The voice came from behind, and before the uninvited guest spoke, he had not sensed them at all—even Dragon Whale Great Sage couldn't have done that!</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Zishen's shock was immense. A veteran of countless battles, he didn't turn his head but lunged forward, his armor erupting in a dazzling blue light.  This armor's design was similar to the one he wore when infiltrating the land, but there was a world of difference. That armor concealed his aura; this was the legendary armor that made Zishen famous.</p><p>The blue light detached, transforming into a sharp claw, like a three-foot-long blade, exceptionally sharp.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The claw, unexpected and swift as lightning, tore through the air, emitting a piercing shriek.  Unexpectedly, the strike landed on empty space.  Zishen felt no resistance; his rear was clearly empty.</p><p>Zishen's heart sank.  He heard the voice again.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, now a broken man, why not seek help from the Saint King?"</p><p>Although the question was directed at him, the tone was unusually calm. Even more shocking, the voice seemed to come from all directions—the speaker was omnipresent, elusive.</p><p>At that moment, Zishen noticed that the surrounding space had inexplicably darkened. The daylight seemed veiled, and upon closer inspection, he saw wisps of sword energy floating around him, their intent suffocating.</p><p>"This sword intent..."</p><p>Zishen felt a strange familiarity with this sword intent. While many demon clans cultivated their bodies and bloodlines and were proficient with swords, few eschewed shortcuts to focus their energy on the Way of the Sword.</p><p>As he pondered, Zishen saw a stream of light descending in front of him, transforming into a hazy figure. One hand was behind its back, the other held a sword pointing downwards, its aura ethereal. The figure was blurry, but its facial features were vaguely discernible—its eyes were gray-white, its expression indifferent.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Zishen finally recognized his enemy, his face paling in shock. He had a vivid memory of Qin Sang. After their encounter at the Liuzhou Hall auction, he had been forced into a humiliating retreat, losing two brothers who had followed him for many years to Qin Sang. Later, news of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect incident emerged, revealing that the Saint King had also suffered a significant loss at this person's hands, which somewhat eased Zishen's mind.  Yet, this man dared to appear in the heart of the demon territory!  Moreover, this person's cultivation...</p><p>Zishen discovered that the illusory figure was not alone.  There were seven such figures, seemingly manifestations but not quite, encircling him. Although they looked incredibly frail, easily shattered, once integrated into the formation, the sword array's momentum shifted dramatically.  Zishen felt like he was facing seven peerless swordsmen simultaneously.</p><p>Outside the sword array, Qin Sang stood suspended in the air.  As the Saint King's army began to rout, he guessed that the Great Sages and Demon Kings would scatter. He had infiltrated the area beforehand.  Before him and Tianmudie, the enemy had nowhere to hide.  His first target was the solitary Qingmao Rat Demon.</p><p>The seven figures were his seven sword spirits. After stabilizing his cultivation, Qin Sang had condensed these spirits according to his cultivation technique. Newly formed, they were hazy and elusive, but their integration into the sword array had revolutionized the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>Finding no opponent at his level, he decided to test his swords against the demon Great Sages! Qin Sang had laid out the sword formation in advance, and Zishen, completely unaware, had walked right into it.</p><p>Inside the sword array, Zishen erupted in a strong blue light.  Within the light, the image of the Qingmao Rat Demon appeared, directly transforming into its true form. The demon body perfectly matched the armor, which could change according to his will.</p><p>The Qingmao Rat Demon tilted its head and let out a ferocious roar.  Its armor glowed brightly, its bones cracking with each sound as its body swelled dramatically with the armor, growing to several dozen feet tall in an instant.  </p><p>Its body continued to grow, seemingly without end.</p><p>The colossal Qingmao Rat Demon stood tall, its massive body trembling, its eyes blazing with fury. It lunged forward, its enormous claws slashing through the air with a piercing shriek, seemingly tearing apart both the sword threads and the void itself.  </p><p>A single claw strike could cleave mountains and rivers!</p><p>Qin Sang, aware of the scene within the array, remained expressionless, seemingly casually forming a sword gesture.</p><p>His spirit-sword arm trembled slightly, and the sword in his hand rose slightly, its tip pointed directly at the Qingmao Rat Demon.</p><p>Suddenly, an unparalleled sword intent erupted. The sword threads floating in the array were drawn towards the spirit-sword, converging madly on the sword in its hand. The dazzling sword light stung the Qingmao Rat Demon's eyes.</p><p>The array and the spirit-sword seemed to vanish, leaving only seven beams of sword light in the heavens and earth.</p><p>Boundless killing intent and sword intent, like a collapsing mountain and surging ocean, assaulted the Qingmao Rat Demon's spirit, destroying everything in their path. The Qingmao Rat Demon's heart pounded violently, its eyes filled with fear, its massive body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>No one could imagine the terror it was experiencing.</p><p>It had never witnessed such terrifying killing intent. The spirit-sword moved as if appearing out of thin air, instantly reaching its peak power. Anyone with a weaker spirit would have their defenses shattered immediately.</p><p>In addition, there was a pressure that it had only felt from the Qinghu Saint King, as if it was facing not only a single opponent but also the rejection of the heavens themselves, utterly alone and helpless.</p><p>Transcendence!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Sword light tore through the air.</p><p>These were no longer sword lights, but seven true swords of slaughter.  Sword marks crisscrossed the void, finally converging above the Qingmao Rat Demon's head before descending suddenly!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The swords fell!</p><p>The Qingmao Rat Demon's towering body suddenly shrank, letting out a horrific cry, a mixture of screams and roars.</p><p>The Qingmao Rat Demon tried to escape, but there was nowhere to flee.</p><p>A series of explosions echoed continuously.</p><p>Only a ball of sword light remained in the void, obscuring the Rat Demon. The sword light, heavy as a thousand jun, fell like a meteor striking the sea.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>A deep crater was gouged out of the sea's surface.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared above the waves, a sword light shooting upwards before returning to his sleeve.</p><p>Looking below, the Qingmao Rat Demon had returned to its original size, its body curled up and trembling. Not only had its magical power been shattered by a single sword strike, but the luster of its armor was gone, with visible cracks from which blood continuously flowed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Several parts of the armor shattered, fragments swept away by the waves.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>During his cultivation, Qin Sang had a premonition that after merging with the spirit-sword, the Seven Souls Killing Array would undergo earth-shattering changes. The Transcendence stage was also a moment of enlightenment for the creator of the technique.</p><p>Today's test proved it to be extraordinary.  It not only defeated the Qingmao Rat Demon, but also destroyed its armor. If Qin Sang hadn't deliberately spared it at the last moment intending to capture it alive, the results would have been even more devastating.</p><p>It is important to note that this was the result of the newly formed spirit-sword without using his life-bound spirit sword.</p><p>It's hard to imagine how powerful the Seven Souls Killing Array will become once he uses the Yunyou Sword!</p><p>Of course, the sword Qin Sang was currently using wasn't simple either.</p><p>With a slight tremor of his sleeve, the sword light returned to his palm, revealing a rather delicate, slender sword.</p><p>This sword was not the Jincheng Sword. It was a sword obtained from Su Zinan's belongings, called the Huying Sword.</p><p>This was not originally Su Zinan's possession.</p><p>During the Battle of Di Shou Mountain, four swords flew out from the belongings of a female cultivator from the Sword Pavilion. The jade sword was destroyed, the golden sword recorded the inheritance of the Jinxiang lineage's sword array, and there were two other long swords. One, possibly the female cultivator's personal sword, disappeared in the chaos; the other, obtained by Su Zinan, was this Huying Sword.</p><p>This sword was actually a pseudo-spiritual treasure-level spirit sword!</p><p>Since it was not the female cultivator's life-bound spirit sword, its grade had not dropped. However, having been un-nurtured for years, it was still a long way from developing its own spiritual essence.</p><p>Refining a pseudo-spiritual treasure wasn't as troublesome as a spiritual treasure. Qin Sang always kept it with him, having already mastered it. He didn't mind that it was a woman's sword.</p><p>With this sword, Qin Sang didn't need to worry about re-refining the Jincheng Sword.</p><p>The *Ji Yuan Technique* couldn't be used on the Huying Sword. Qin Sang recalled that a secret technique for refining ordinary pseudo-spiritual treasures had appeared at the Liuzhou Hall auction and was bought by the Grand Elder of the Qiong Ying Sect.</p><p>When the opportunity arises, he could pay them a visit.</p><p>Qin Sang was refining the Yunyou and Huying swords, fearing insufficient energy, he prioritized the Yunyou sword, using the Huying sword as a transition. This didn't hinder his learning of that secret technique, which also benefited his weapon refinement.</p><p>The fake spiritual treasure combined with the Seven Souls Killing Formation, and the ambush, no wonder that Zishen Da Sheng wasn't a match for even one round.</p><p>Just then, purple clouds suddenly rose from the sea. Zishen Da Sheng, not dead, finally gained a respite, apparently having used some kind of magical treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, his sword momentum rising again.</p><p>...</p><p>"Brother Hei, Bai Ming Mountain is not far ahead."</p><p>Four figures sped across the sea. A man in white pointed ahead, speaking to the black-bearded, strong man beside him.</p><p>Several protrusions were visible on the sea's surface.  Several large islands could be seen in the distance, but they were quite desolate, overgrown with yellow grass, and seemed to lack spiritual energy.</p><p>The speaker was Bai Xiao Da Sheng.</p><p>He was speaking to another Da Sheng under the command of the Qinghu Saint King, a black lion in its true form, whose name was simple and direct: Hei Shi Da Sheng.</p><p>After Bai Xiao Da Sheng spoke, he gestured with his hand, dispelling the illusion. The scene immediately changed dramatically.</p><p>Those islands were actually one giant island, with only one mountain range winding like a dragon, majestic and brimming with spiritual energy, a rare and wonderful blessed land.</p><p>Hei Shi Da Sheng examined Bai Ming Mountain, saying in a deep voice, "We've served under the Saint King for many years, yet this is the first time you've invited me to your domain."</p><p>Bai Xiao Da Sheng laughed heartily, "Brother Hei, you once held a prominent position in the Saint King's Palace; you wouldn't have cared for this humble place. My invitation would've been unwelcome.  Rest assured, Brother Hei, we will be co-rulers of this mountain, and your residence will be no worse than mine..."</p><p>Zishen Da Sheng had kin, but Hei Shi Da Sheng, like the Qinghu Saint King, was from the mainland, a complete loner. Bai Xiao Da Sheng deliberately sought this demon's alliance, strengthening Bai Ming Mountain's power in anticipation of the future.</p><p>Hei Shi Da Sheng chuckled and said nothing more.</p><p>The other two were妖王 under Bai Xiao Da Sheng, with other妖王 and their troops following behind. Seeing things turn sour, Bai Xiao Da Sheng immediately took his trusted subordinates with him.</p><p>The demons flew towards Bai Ming Mountain, soon reaching the shore.</p><p>A thin mist drifted over Bai Ming Mountain. Bai Xiao Da Sheng had built a mountain gate and training grounds for his demon soldiers, now concealed by a formation.</p><p>The demons landed before the mountain gate, before activating the formation, while Bai Xiao Da Sheng was laughing and chatting with Hei Shi Da Sheng, he suddenly twitched his nose, his brow furrowing. "The smell of blood!"</p><p>The mist parted, revealing the mountain gate.</p><p>The demons' faces changed!</p><p>Before the mountain gate, blood flowed like a river, with two corpses lying there.</p><p>A bone bird and a demonic fish.</p><p>Judging by the blood, they were definitely transformed-stage demon kings!</p><p>"Medial Bone!"</p><p>One demon king cried out upon seeing the bone bird.</p><p>These two demons were Bai Xiao Da Sheng's capable subordinates, left to guard Bai Ming Mountain, and had inexplicably died at their own doorstep.</p><p>A sense of foreboding arose in the hearts of several demon kings.</p><p>At that moment, a Taoist priest emerged from behind the mountain gate, smiling and nodding at them, then looking at Bai Xiao Da Sheng, "You're too late. I've been waiting for you for a long time."</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Bai Xiao Da Sheng, remembering Qin Sang, his face changed drastically.</p><p>Immediately, the four demon kings' expressions turned vacant.</p><p>Qin Sang did not conceal his cultivation.</p><p>The man they had hunted down was now a Transcendent Being!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the two corpses beneath him.</p><p>It was quite fortuitous.</p><p>He had arrived at Bai Ming Mountain earlier, intending to intercept Bai Xiao Da Sheng at the foot of the mountain, but the mountain was sealed by a formation; even with his abilities, it was difficult to enter undetected.  Once those inside activated the formation to its full power, breaking through would take time, alerting them.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he encountered these two demons wandering outside. Recognizing them as old enemies, he killed them, seized Bai Xiao Da Sheng's residence, and waited here.</p><p>He only killed the demon kings; he wasn't interested in the lesser demons.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A black demonic wind appeared out of nowhere. Hei Shi Da Sheng reacted swiftly, turning to flee.</p><p>Bai Xiao Da Sheng was not slow either, not expecting any mercy from Qin Sang, and dared not return home, leading his troops in flight.</p><p>Qin Sang remained where he was, watching the four fleeing demons, his eyes shining with a strange light, deep and profound like the boundless starry sky, with countless stars shimmering within.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Bai Ming Island was plunged into darkness.</p><p>The four demon kings looked up in alarm.</p><p>It was midday, yet the sun had vanished, as if it were midnight.</p><p>High above, stars shone.</p><p>The starlight fell upon them, bringing a bone-chilling coldness.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the stars were incomplete, fewer than the total number of stars in the heavens; only the White Tiger Seven Mansions, but sufficient to seal them.</p><p>The four demon kings felt the void around them stretching infinitely, the sea beneath their feet disappearing, pulled into the depths of space, immediately surrounded by stars.</p><p>Qin Sang had changed his tactic, this formation was the Seven Mansions Starfield Sword Formation!</p><p>Each of the Seven Mansions had a star sword guarded by a sword spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang flew high, his clothes fluttering, entering the formation.</p><p>Stars flowed.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
