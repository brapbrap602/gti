<h1>Chapter 513: Self-Refinement</h1><p>Chapter 513: Self-Refinement</p><p>This sudden command must have a reason.</p><p>Considering the Tianyou Pass auction in half a month, it can be determined that the Qingyang Demon Sect Master is not currently in the sect!</p><p>Opportunity knocks but once.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance and couldn't wait any longer.  He made an immediate decision to initiate the next phase of his plan.</p><p>At this time, Yunyouzi had already entered Wuyagu Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly left Qingyang Market and came to a desolate mountain.</p><p>This mountain was one he had chosen long ago. A cave had been carved out within it, and restrictions and spirit gathering arrays had been set up, making it a first-rate secluded dwelling.</p><p>Entering the cave, he sealed the restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang infused spirit stones into the spirit gathering array.  Once the spiritual energy in the cave became abundant, he took a deep breath and opened his pouch.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>The Shao Yin magnetic bottle, five Yin objects, and a Heavenly Corpse Talisman, flew out one after another from the pouch, instantly scattered before Qin Sang.</p><p>Having already made up his mind, he naturally wouldn't hesitate.</p><p>He hooked a finger, took a Heavenly Corpse Talisman into his palm, looked at it, confirmed it was correct, and then slapped it onto his forehead, controlling the talisman into his spirit space.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's will, the jade Buddha did not reject the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, allowing it to enter his spirit.</p><p>Repeating past actions, Qin Sang was clearly more proficient this time.</p><p>However, last time he faced a life-or-death crisis and had no choice, but this time it was for a slim possibility, to attempt a path to Jindan stage cultivation, a proactive act.</p><p>Qin Sang proactively accepted the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, without any rejection or resistance, so the first step of refining the living corpse was easily completed.  What followed, however, was unprecedented.</p><p>Perhaps even those demonic cultivators from the Corpse Refining Demon Sect wouldn't be so mad as to refine themselves into living corpses?</p><p>Qin Sang raised his arm and looked down.</p><p>With the Heavenly Corpse Talisman entering his body, under the influence of the restrictions, his body had begun to change. His skin was faintly pale, and his veins showed a light blue tint, though not outwardly obvious.</p><p>But Qin Sang himself could feel it, a sign of corpse energy gradually emerging.</p><p>Instinctively, a bloodthirsty desire surfaced in his heart. However, the corpse transformation had just begun, the degree was not deep, and even without the jade Buddha's protection, it was easy to suppress.</p><p>Pressing on his pale skin, Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and looked at the five Yin objects on the ground.</p><p>The "Spirit Cultivation Sword Chapter" itself has no attributes. Qin Sang, having cultivated along the path of the "幽冥经" (You Ming Jing), had always used water-element spiritual energy. He immediately pointed at the Yin Spirit Water.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely familiar with the corpse refining restrictions. He opened the bottle cap, drew out a ball of Yin Spirit Water, held it in his palm, and slowly refined it.</p><p>[Book Reading Benefits] Follow the public account [Book Friend Base Camp] to draw cash/coins every day!</p><p>Soon the refinement was complete. Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then wrapped the Yin Spirit Water with spiritual energy and slowly floated it towards his dantian.</p><p>The Yin Spirit Water touched his body, and an icy coldness immediately spread.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly, but his movements were unaffected. He sent the Yin Spirit Water into his dantian and immediately began to inscribe the corpse refining restrictions on his body, using the Yin Spirit Water to stabilize his energy sea.</p><p>The Five Elements generate each other.</p><p>Next came the Moon Willow core, Ghost Carving Feather, Nine-Hole Stone, and finally, the Blue Nether Gold.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's own constraint, the spiritual energy within his energy sea was very docile, and this step of establishing the Five Elements foundation was also completed smoothly without any setbacks.</p><p>Now, only one step remained: drawing in the evil energy.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the remaining five Yin objects, leaving only a large pile of Shao Yin magnetic bottles on the ground.</p><p>Logically, this step of drawing in the evil energy was best done in the Earth-Sinking Cave; if the earth evil energy was depleted, it could be replenished at any time.</p><p>But the Earth-Sinking Cave was too far from here, and Qin Sang didn't have that much time.</p><p>Wu Shang had personally experienced that after drawing in the evil energy, the earth evil energy would become uncontrollable and begin to impact the body, and the speed of corpse transformation would be astonishing.</p><p>If he refined himself into a living corpse in the Earth-Sinking Cave, before he could travel all the way back to Qingyang Market, his body would completely lose its life and could no longer be recovered.</p><p>Fortunately, according to Wu Shang's experience, refining oneself and refining others were different.</p><p>Refining others requires control through soul imprints; there is a layer of separation, and both sensing speed, reaction speed, and control will be affected.</p><p>It's different for oneself. One can better constrain the body's spiritual energy's repulsion of earth evil energy, and can respond to any changes in the first instant. The probability of success in drawing in the evil energy is greatly increased, and much less earth evil energy will be wasted.</p><p>The same principle applies to later enhancing the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>However, this step presents a new difficulty.</p><p>The intrusion of earth-sha energy into the body delivers a terrifying blow to the qi sea, causing unbearable pain.  As the refinement progresses, the increasingly severe corpse transformation further impacts the mind.</p><p>The combined effects make maintaining mental stability during the process incredibly difficult, demanding immense willpower.  Any lapse in composure could lead to complete failure.</p><p>Years ago, Wu Shang prepared several pills to heal and stabilize the mind, but the transformation proved far more violent than anticipated.  He relied solely on his unwavering resolve, making a desperate gamble that ultimately succeeded.</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, doesn't fear the corpse transformation, but his ability to withstand the turbulent pain in his qi sea depends entirely on his willpower.</p><p>His face shows no fear. He swallows several healing pills and retrieves a small yin magnetic bottle.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The bottle opens.</p><p>A wisp of earth-sha energy escapes.</p><p>After a moment's reflection, Qin Sang senses his qi sea, confirming there are no flaws, before carefully drawing a wisp of the earth-sha energy into it.</p><p>‘Hiss…’</p><p>A chill far exceeding that of Yin Spirit Water causes Qin Sang to tremble slightly, but he quickly steadies himself, focusing intently on the energy’s changes.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A storm erupts within his qi sea.  Even Qin Sang's own spiritual energy is initially unable to control the earth-sha energy, which completely escapes his grasp.</p><p>His qi sea is thrown into chaos, the two energies clashing.</p><p>However, unlike before, Qin Sang doesn't immediately expel the earth-sha energy. He can clearly perceive every change in his body, and he hasn't yet lost control.</p><p>The conflict intensifies. Qin Sang feels as if plunged into an icy abyss, his body frozen, while his qi sea boils.</p><p>Fortunately, the barrier formed by the five yin objects makes his dantian exceptionally strong, preventing immediate destruction.</p><p>Qin Sang perseveres for three breaths before expelling the wisp of earth-sha energy.  As his qi sea recovers, he carefully reviews the process, gaining significant insights.</p><p>Moments later,</p><p>Qin Sang draws another wisp of earth-sha energy.  This time, guided by his previous experience, he proceeds more gradually.</p><p>The second attempt also fails, but yields further knowledge.</p><p>He tries again.</p><p>Despite repeated setbacks, his progress is noticeably faster than when refining the living corpse. Qin Sang's expression grows increasingly relaxed.</p><p>Finally, using only the contents of a single small yin magnetic bottle, Qin Sang successfully incorporates a wisp of earth-sha energy into his qi sea!</p>
