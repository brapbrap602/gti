Chapter 321: The Secret Emporium

After obtaining the token to the auction from Steward Pu, Qin Sang recuperated at the Elixir Pavilion for a few days as advised. Three days prior to the auction, he left Yinshan Pass and flew toward Stone Island.

Along the way, he noticed other cultivators also heading in the same direction. However, unlike the orderliness maintained by the guards at Yinshan Pass, everyone here was wary of each other and generally kept their distance.

Qin Sang rode his Sky Shuttle, flying low beneath the treetops as he thought to himself.

He had obtained the Sky Shuttle back when he was in Qi Refining Stage. It was merely a high-grade magic tool, which was passable when he was in Qi Refining Stage, but now he found it somewhat slow and time-consuming.

This thought had occurred to him on his way from Xuanlu Pass.

For long-distance travel, the Sky Shuttle was essential for speed and comfort.

Riding his sword or using the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot would have been faster, but they consumed a lot of spiritual power, which he could not sustain for long periods.

Over the years, Qin Sang had never found a better means of transportation. However, this trade fair might provide him with an opportunity to find a replacement for his Sky Shuttle.

In addition, he planned to buy more Spirit Wood if available.

Of course, the most important item was the Soul-Guiding Grass. Qin Sang would not hold out much hope for other items and would take whatever he could find.

He flew for a while over the swamp before noticing that the mist ahead had become thinner, indicating his arrival at Stone Island. He urged his Sky Shuttle forward and flew above the mist.

From high up, the mist in the swamp seemed endless, like a vast sea of clouds.

The weather was somewhat gloomy, but he still had an unobstructed view in all directions. Except for the occasional treetop that emerged from the mist, there was nothing to obstruct his line of sight.

Few people dared to fly above the mist, since it made them an easy target, unless they were extremely confident in their abilities.

Qin Sang looked around cautiously before finally looking straight ahead.

Ahead of him, in the otherwise uniform layer of mist, there was a large, empty circle. There was not a single wisp of mist within this circle.

The thick mist rolled toward the circle but was blocked by an invisible barrier, which forced it to flow downward, creating a circular "waterfall" at the edge of the circle.

This phenomenon was unending and truly spectacular.

Stone Island lay beneath the circle, but one could not fly directly over it.

Qin Sang descended back into the mist and flew forward for a while. Suddenly, a strange force pushed against him, as if trying to expel him.

The force was not very strong, as Steward Pu had mentioned. Any cultivator in Qi Refining Stage Layer 10 or above could resist it.

Qin Sang's spiritual power surged, easily resisting the pressure. Soon after, he felt a sudden lightness as the clouds and mist before him cleared, revealing an island.

The island was entirely composed of black stone, resembling a turtle's back lying in the middle of the swamp. It was devoid of any vegetation.

Concentric circles of stone houses were built on the island, with a magnificent, high-rise building in the center. This was where the auction would be held.

At this time, many cultivators were coming and going from the island, trading among themselves in the stone houses.

Donning a cloak to conceal his face, Qin Sang landed on Stone Island. A few cultivators glanced at him before looking away to mind their own business. Qin Sang began to wander slowly among the stone houses.

Enchanted evil objects, magic tools, and cultivation manuals...

Everything was available.

Due to the restrictions of the spell formation outside Stone Island, the cultivators who entered were all powerful, so the treasures they possessed were naturally of good quality.

However, none of these things caught Qin Sang's eye.

He browsed for a while but quickly became disappointed. He had not seen a single top-grade flying magic tool, and although there was some Spirit Wood available, the quality was low. It was not even as good as Golden Silkworm Pine Wood. Currently, even this level of Spirit Wood could barely enhance his Ebony Sword, so buying it would be a waste of Spirit Stones.

In hindsight, it was reasonable. People were unlikely to bring their truly valuable possessions to a market like this.

Qin Sang pondered for a moment and decided to stop wasting time. He suddenly walked toward the end of the street and stopped in front of an inconspicuous stone house.

There was no sign on the stone house, nor were there any items inside. There was only an elderly man with white hair who sat alone, seemingly asleep.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist."

Qin Sang entered the stone house, cupped his hands politely, and gently roused the old man.

The old man stood up and returned the greeting, waved his hand to close off the stone house's forbidden restriction, and said: "I have been remiss. Please, fellow Daoist, do not take offense. Do you have any important matters to attend to? I do not have any magical instruments or elixirs to sell here."
Qin Sang smiled slightly. "I shall not conceal it from you, fellow Daoist. I received guidance from a friend, who informed me that you have a way of inviting many fellow Daoists together to engage in mutual exchange. That is why I have come to ask you for guidance and direction."
The old man gave a short exclamation and looked Qin Sang up and down once without making him remove his cloak. He stroked his long beard and said, "Since you know my identity, fellow Daoist, you must have been introduced by an old friend. However...rules must not be broken. This has nothing to do with the level of cultivation. You..."
Before he could finish speaking, the old man saw Qin Sang extend his palm. Three exquisite and tiny spirit swords lay side by side there.
These three spirit swords were precisely the ones he had acquired from the three people from Da Yue. They were all superb-grade magical instruments, but there were some stronger and some weaker ones. The scarred man's spirit sword was at the peak of superb-grade magical instruments.
Qin Sang had his Ebony Wood Sword and had no use for these spirit swords for the moment so he decided long ago to exchange them.
Every time Stone Islet City opened for business, this old man before him would organize a group of people and privately host a secret market. This man had some skill, and his secret market was well-received.
To participate in the secret market, one needed to either receive an invitation from the old man or demonstrate sufficient "strength" to gain the old man's recognition.
Qin Sang had come looking for this man after learning about his identity from Chief Steward Pu.
"Is this enough?"
Qin Sang asked with a smile.
Seeing Qin Sang take out three superb-grade magical instruments in one go, the light in the old man's cloudy eyes brightened immediately. He said at once, "Enough! Enough! Fellow Daoist, take this jade pendant..."
The old man gave him a jade pendant.
"The auction has not begun yet, and the crowd is not assembled. I have decided to hold the secret market after the auction is over. The location of the secret market is not yet decided. When the auction is over, fellow Daoist, stay on Stone Islet an extra day. Activate the restriction in the jade pendant with spiritual power at that time, and you will receive guidance."
The old man carefully explained to Qin Sang how to use the jade pendant.
"Many thanks, fellow Daoist." Qin Sang accepted the jade pendant, bid farewell to the old man, and walked out of the stone house.
He patiently wandered around once more, but only acquired two low-level magical instruments with special effects. Qin Sang lost interest, rented a meditation room in Stone Islet City.
Three days pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye.
Night fell, and Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes and pushed the door open to leave.
The lights on the tall building on Stone Islet were resplendent. Many Immortals had already gathered before its entrance. The auction was about to begin!

**Chapter 321: Secret Market**

Qin Sang finally obtained the token for the auction from Steward Pu. Following Steward Pu's instructions, he rested for a few days at Spirit Pill Pavilion before leaving Yinshan Pass three days in advance and flying toward Stone Island.

Along the way, he could see many遁光 flying in the same direction. However, there were no guards from Yinshan Pass to maintain order. Everyone maintained a vigilant distance from each other and did not approach each other casually.

Qin Sang controlled his Flying Shuttle, flying low above the treetops. He pondered secretly.

The Flying Shuttle was a magic treasure he had obtained in the Qi Refining Stage. It was only a high-grade magic treasure, which was fine for the Qi Refining Stage, but he now felt that it was a bit slow and wasted time.

This thought had already occurred to him when he came from Xuanguan Pass.

When traveling long distances, one needed to use a magic treasure like the Flying Shuttle to be fast and relaxed.

One could not always fly on a sword or activate the Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman. These two methods were indeed faster, but they consumed a lot of spiritual energy and could not be maintained for long.

Over the years, Qin Sang had not found a better substitute. This trade fair was an opportunity. He might as well search carefully and replace the Flying Shuttle.

Additionally, he wanted to seize this opportunity to buy more spirit wood.

Of course, Soul-Attracting Grass was still the most important. He would not force himself to obtain the other things and would only take them if he came across them.

After flying for a while in the swamp, Qin Sang suddenly saw that the fog ahead became sparse. He knew that he had reached Stone Island and urged the Flying Shuttle to fly above the fog.

Looking down from the sky, the fog in the swamp seemed like an endless sea of clouds.

The weather was a bit gloomy, but he could still see everything in all directions. Other than treetops occasionally jutting out of the fog, there was nothing to obstruct his vision.

Very few people dared to fly above the fog layer. After all, their target would be too obvious unless they were extremely confident in their strength.

Qin Sang looked around vigilantly before looking straight ahead.

Not far in front of him, a large, empty, circular hole suddenly appeared in the smooth layer of fog, devoid of any vapor.

The thick fog rolled and moved toward the hole, where it would be blocked by an invisible barrier and forced to flow downward, causing the thick fog to form a ring-shaped 'waterfall' around the edge of the hole.

This process was endless and spectacular.

Stone Island was directly below the hole, but one could not fly there directly.

Qin Sang descended back into the fog layer. After flying forward for a while, a strange force suddenly fell upon him, trying to push him out.

This force was not strong, which was similar to what Steward Pu had said. As long as a cultivator had reached the tenth level of the Qi Refining Stage, they could resist it.

Qin Sang's spiritual energy surged, easily resisting the pressure. Soon after, he felt a sudden lightness in his body. The clouds and fog in front of him dissipated, and an island appeared in his sight.

The island was entirely made of black stone, like a turtle's back lying in the middle of the swamp, with no grass or vegetation growing on it.

Concentric circles of orderly stone houses were located on the island, and a magnificent tower was surrounded by them in the center. The auction was held in this tower.

At this time, many cultivators came and went on the island, trading in various stone houses.

Qin Sang put on a cloak to conceal his face and landed on Stone Island. Several cultivators glanced at him before returning to their own business. Qin Sang also began to wander slowly between the stone houses.

Possessed evil spirits, magic treasures, secret manuals...

They had everything one could think of.

Due to the restriction of the island's formation, the cultivators entering Stone Island were all quite strong, and the treasures they could produce were naturally of high quality.

However, these things were not considered impressive by Qin Sang.

After browsing for a while, Qin Sang could not help but be disappointed. He did not see a single top-grade flying magic treasure. There were some spirit wood, but the quality was not high. It was not as good as the Golden Thread Snow Pine Wood. Now, even spirit wood of that level could only slightly improve the Ebony Sword. Buying it would be a waste of spirit stones.

It was normal. In a trade fair like this, few people would be willing to offer their truly good items.

Qin Sang pondered for a while, no longer wasting time, and suddenly walked toward the end of the street. He finally stopped in front of an inconspicuous stone house.

The stone house had no sign, and there were no items inside. Only an old man with white hair was sitting alone, dozing off.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist."

Qin Sang walked into the stone house, cupped his hands, and gently woke the old man.

The old man stood up and returned the greeting. He waved his hand to activate the prohibition on the stone house and said, "I have been impolite. Please don't take offense. What brings you here? I don't have any dharma artifacts or pills for sale."

Qin Sang smiled slightly and said, "I won't lie to you. A friend of mine gave me a tip that you have a way to invite fellow cultivators to engage in mutual exchanges. I came asking for your guidance."

The old man said with an "oh" and ran his eyes over Qin Sang. He did not ask him to remove his cloak. He stroked his long beard and said, "If you know my identity, you must have been introduced by an old acquaintance. However... the rules cannot be broken. This has nothing to do with cultivation. So, you..."

Halfway through his sentence, the old man saw Qin Sang open his palm to display three small and exquisite spirit swords resting side by side.

These three spirit swords came from the three men from Daiyue. They were all top-grade dharma artifacts, but their quality varied. The spirit sword belonging to the scarred man was among the very best top-grade dharma artifacts.

Qin Sang already had the Ebonywood Sword, so he had no use for these spirit swords. That was why he had decided to exchange them.

Every time the Stone Island Auction was on, this old man would gather some people together to open a secret auction. He had a few skills up his sleeve, and his secret auction had a good reputation.

To participate in the secret auction, one would either need to be personally invited by the old man or demonstrate sufficient "strength" to earn his recognition.

Qin Sang learned the man's identity from Butler Pu and sought him out.

"Are these enough?"

Qin Sang said with a smile.

The old man's clouded eyes lit up when he saw Qin Sang take out three top-grade dharma artifacts at once. He immediately said, "Enough! More than enough! Take this jade pendant..."

The old man handed him a jade pendant.

"The auction hasn't started yet, and not everyone has arrived. I will open the secret auction after the end of the auction. The location of the secret auction hasn't been decided. Please stay on Stone Island for one more day after the auction. Use your spiritual power to activate the prohibition in the jade pendant at that time to get directions."

The old man gave Qin Sang detailed instructions on how to use the jade pendant.

"Thank you," Qin Sang said. He put away the jade pendant, bid farewell to the old man, and walked out of the stone house.

He walked around for a while and only managed to find two low-grade dharma artifacts with special effects. Qin Sang lost interest and rented a quiet room on Stone Island.

Three days passed by in the blink of an eye.

Night fell, and Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes and pushed the door open.

The tall building in the middle of Stone Island was brightly lit. Many cultivators had gathered in front of the entrance. The auction was about to start!

Chapter 321: The Secret Market


Finally, Qin Sang received the auction invitation from Manager Pu. Following Manager Pu's instructions, he rested at the Lingdan Pavilion for a few days before departing from Yinshan Pass three days early, flying towards Stone Island.


Along the way, he saw other figures flying in the same direction. However, unlike the orderly Yinshan Pass, there were no guards here to maintain order. Everyone remained vigilant and generally avoided approaching each other.


Qin Sang steered his flying shuttle, flying low above the treetops, lost in thought.


The flying shuttle was a high-grade artifact he had obtained during his Qi Condensation stage. It was sufficient then, but now he found it too slow, wasting his time.


This thought had occurred to him since leaving Xuanlu Pass.


For long-distance travel, a fast and effortless method like a flying shuttle was necessary.


He couldn't continuously fly on his sword or activate the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman. While faster, these methods consumed too much spiritual energy to sustain for long periods.


For years, Qin Sang hadn't found a better alternative. This trade fair presented an opportunity to look for one and replace his flying shuttle.


He also planned to buy more spirit wood.


Of course, the most important thing was the Soul-Guiding Grass; the rest were secondary.


After flying through the swamp for a while, Qin Sang saw the fog ahead thinning, indicating his arrival at Stone Island. He sped up the flying shuttle and soared above the fog.


From the high altitude, the swamp's fog resembled a boundless sea of clouds.


The weather was gloomy, but the surroundings were clear, with only occasional treetops breaking through the fog, obstructing nothing.


Few dared to fly above the fog layer; it made them obvious targets, unless they were very confident in their abilities.


Qin Sang cautiously looked around before focusing on the front.


Not far ahead, a large circular hole abruptly appeared in the smooth fog layer, devoid of any mist.


The swirling fog, upon reaching the hole, was blocked by an invisible barrier, forced downward, creating a ring-shaped "waterfall" at the edge of the hole.


This phenomenon continued endlessly.


The scene was magnificent.


Stone Island lay beneath the hole, but direct flight was impossible.


Qin Sang descended back into the fog, flying forward a distance before a strange force pushed him outward.


The force wasn't strong, consistent with Manager Pu's description; cultivators above the tenth level of Qi Condensation could resist it.


Spiritual energy surged from Qin Sang, easily countering the pressure. Soon, the pressure lifted, the fog dissipated, and an island appeared before him.


The island, entirely made of black stone, resembled a turtle's back nestled in the swamp's center, devoid of vegetation.


Neatly arranged stone houses dotted the island, surrounding a grand building at the center—the auction venue.


Many cultivators moved between the stone houses, conducting trades.


Putting on a cloak to conceal his face, Qin Sang landed on Stone Island. Several cultivators glanced at him before returning to their tasks. Qin Sang began strolling leisurely among the houses.


Spirit-infused artifacts, tools, cultivation techniques…


Everything was available.


Due to the island's external array, the cultivators present were strong, and the treasures they possessed were of high quality.


However, these items barely caught Qin Sang's interest.


After wandering for a while, Qin Sang felt disappointed.  He hadn't seen a single top-grade flying artifact. There was some spirit wood, but the quality was low, inferior even to Golden Silk Cedar Wood. Now, even that level of wood offered minimal improvement to the Ebony Sword; buying it would be a waste of spirit stones.


It was reasonable; such informal trade events rarely saw truly valuable items offered.


After pondering, Qin Sang decided to stop wasting time. He walked towards the end of the street, stopping before an unassuming stone house.


The house had no sign, and contained nothing but a white-haired old man alone, dozing off.


"Greetings, Daoist friend."


Qin Sang entered the house, bowed, and gently awakened the old man.


An elderly man rose and returned the greeting, waving his hand to deactivate the barrier sealing the stone hut.  "My apologies for the delay, please forgive my tardiness.  What brings you here, friend? I don't sell magic weapons or pills."

Qin Sang smiled slightly.  "With all due respect, a friend advised me that you have a way to connect cultivators, facilitating exchanges. I would be grateful for your guidance."

The old man uttered an "Oh," studying Qin Sang from head to toe without asking him to remove his cloak.  He stroked his long beard.  "Since you know my identity, you must have been referred by an acquaintance. However… the rules are immutable, regardless of cultivation level. You…"

Mid-sentence, the old man saw Qin Sang open his palm, revealing three small, exquisite spirit swords.

These three swords were obtained from the three men from Mount Tai, all top-grade artifacts, though varying in quality. The scarred man's sword was among the finest of the top-grade artifacts.

Qin Sang already possessed the Ebony Sword, so these were surplus to his needs, and he’d decided to use them for trade.

This elderly man organized a private market among select individuals during the Stone Island auctions. He was quite adept and enjoyed an excellent reputation.

To participate in the private market, one either had to be personally invited by the elder or demonstrate sufficient "strength" to gain his approval.

Qin Sang had sought out the elder after receiving guidance from Manager Pu.

"Is this sufficient?" Qin Sang asked with a smile.

Seeing three top-grade artifacts presented at once, the old man's cloudy eyes brightened. "More than enough! More than enough!  Take this jade pendant…"

The old man handed him a jade pendant.

"The auction hasn't begun yet, and attendance is still incomplete. I've decided to hold the private market after the auction concludes. The location is yet to be determined. Please stay on Stone Island an extra day; activate the enchantment within the jade pendant with your spiritual energy to receive the directions."

The old man explained how to use the pendant in detail.

"Thank you," Qin Sang said, accepting the pendant before taking his leave.

After patiently exploring the island for a while longer, acquiring only two low-grade artifacts with unique properties, Qin Sang lost interest and rented a secluded room on Stone Island.

Three days passed quickly.

Night fell, and Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes and stepped outside.

The tall building in the center of Stone Island was brilliantly lit, its entrance already crowded with many cultivators. The auction was about to begin!
