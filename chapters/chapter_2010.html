<h1>Chapter 2001 Mr. Hong</h1><p>‘Clip-clop… clip-clop…’</p><p>A carriage rolled along the official road, neither fast nor slow.  It wasn't large, seating only three or four people, but unusually, it was drawn by two horses.  Other travelers on the road were all drawn to this special carriage.</p><p>The carriage lacked ornate decoration, yet possessed a unique quality.  The two horses were no ordinary steeds; tall and strong, their coats were blood-red, shimmering like the finest silk under the sun.</p><p>The driver sat erect, his posture suggesting an air of superiority as he glanced at passersby – an aura even the wealthiest city officials' drivers lacked.</p><p>The horses moved swiftly, and a small town appeared ahead on the road.</p><p>“Master Daoist, look, that’s Hanwan Town ahead…”</p><p>The driver bowed slightly, speaking to the carriage's occupant with an involuntary increase in respect.</p><p>“Stop here.”</p><p>A calm voice came from within the carriage.</p><p>The driver responded, gently pulling on the reins.  The two horses simultaneously reared, their hooves striking the ground with a resounding thud, yet the carriage remained perfectly still, not a single tremor, leaving onlookers wide-eyed.</p><p>The carriage door opened, and a Daoist priest stepped out, squinting at the town ahead.</p><p>The driver, his face beaming, attentively followed the priest's gaze, inwardly perplexed.  This man was clearly a person of great power, yet why would he visit such an insignificant town? He himself had only found the place after painstakingly asking for directions.</p><p>The Daoist nodded slightly, tossing a small pouch to the driver.  “You may return.”</p><p>The driver opened the pouch, his eyes widening with a smile. “Ah!  Master Daoist, please go safely. I work in Sanqi Island, and if you ever need me, just give a call.”</p><p>Knowing the temperament of such a powerful figure, the driver didn't linger or ask questions, quickly turning his carriage and riding away.</p><p>After traveling for a while, reaching a deserted stretch of road, the driver flicked his wrist, his whip snapping with a ‘crack!’  However, instead of striking the horses, it dispersed into a mist, and both the carriage and horses gradually faded from sight.</p><p>The horses’ rib-cages trembled slightly as blood-red wings unfolded, flapping gently before lifting them into the air.  They trod on clouds, swift as hawks, and vanished into the sky in an instant.</p><p>The Daoist who had disembarked was, of course, Qin Sang.</p><p>He walked into Hanwan Town, listening to the street vendors and soaking in the everyday life.</p><p>After Tianmu Butterfly successfully ascended, Qin Sang first assisted Taiyi in controlling the Thunder Altar and then passed his sword to Yulang.  Having calculated the time, he chose an auspicious day and set off.</p><p>On this journey, Qin Sang brought Gui Hou and Luo Hou.  Those who saw them off included Taiyi, Yulang, Ling Shi, and the two Red Plum Demons – core disciples of Qingyang Temple.  The only outsider present was Guyun Sou.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately presented himself to Guyun Sou as the scion of a powerful outside force, so there was no need to hide it; open honesty was more believable.</p><p>To the outside world, he announced he was going into secluded cultivation and would withdraw from worldly affairs.</p><p>When Yue Shangshi sent the yellow leaf token, he kindly reminded Qin Sang of some troublesome areas on the road to Jitian Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang avoided these places, taking a longer route, and his journey was indeed smooth until he reached Jitian Peak.</p><p>The Jitian Peak cultivation world was similar to Yue Du Bay, centered around a massive island that encompassed vast surrounding waters and countless smaller islands.</p><p>However, native cultivators referred to Jitian Peak as a single mountain.  It was the highest peak on the island, legendary for reaching the heavens, its imposing grandeur unparalleled.</p><p>This legend stemmed from the Jitian Palace, the most powerful force on the island, which occupied the summit – a place of awe-inspiring mystery.</p><p>Unlike the Yue Du Bay cultivation world, the top sects here were all clustered together, their gates built on Jitian Peak, their numerous sects arranged along the mountain's slopes, so close as to be almost neighbours.</p><p>This illustrated the sheer magnitude of Jitian Peak. The eastern part of the island, encompassing over 30% of its landmass, could be considered its base.</p><p>The area gathered the island's spiritual essence, its mountain ridges stacked upon each other, culminating in a towering peak that pierced the sky.</p><p>Even Void Refinement cultivators couldn't create such a dramatic change. It might be the handiwork of a Harmony cultivator, or possibly a marvel of nature.</p><p>The unique geography created this layout.</p><p>After landing on the island, Qin Sang didn't go directly to Jitian Peak. He rented a flying horse carriage and instructed the driver to find a town called Hanwan.</p><p>Mr. Hong lived in this ordinary town.</p><p>As he passed through the town, the noise gradually faded. North of the town lay a mountain.  Its presence wasn't concealed; Qin Sang sensed the aura of a powerful array from afar, confirming the mountain's significance as a sacred place.</p><p>Qin Sang reached the foot of the mountain and saw a village nestled below, with wisps of smoke rising from its chimneys.  He was reminded of Qipai Village and his time in seclusion at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Circling the village, he found a small path winding through the woods, leading to the mountain base.  Soon, he came upon a small fenced yard.</p><p>Beside a clear stream stood three thatched huts, and within the yard was a garden brimming with flowers of every color and variety.</p><p>An old farmer was tending the garden, squatting casually on the ground, his hands covered in soil. Several children played nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed from across the fence, "Excuse me, are you Mr. Hong?"</p><p>The old farmer looked up, squinting at Qin Sang for a moment.  He casually wiped the dirt from his clothes onto his tunic, then stood up, saying, "Are you Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang replied, observing the children; they were ordinary mortals.</p><p>"Alright, children, guests have arrived at Grandpa Hong's.  Go eat your meals, or your parents will scold you!" Mr. Hong clapped his hands, picking a few flowers and giving one to each child.</p><p>The children took their flowers, waving goodbye politely. "Goodbye, Grandpa Hong."</p><p>"Please, Daoist, come in."</p><p>Mr. Hong invited Qin Sang inside and asked, "It will be another ten years until the arrival at Canjin City. Can you wait?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "I can wait."</p><p>Mr. Hong nodded and asked, "This place is simple. Can you endure it?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly and countered, "A mountain is not famous because it is high, but because it has immortals.  A water is not considered spiritual because it is deep, but because it has dragons. What is there to endure?"</p><p>"Haha, you are a remarkable person, Daoist," Mr. Hong laughed, pointing towards the mountain. "The shelters and caves on the mountain are all unoccupied.  You are welcome to choose one for your rest."</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, heeding Yue Shangshi's advice to ask no further questions. However, after entering the courtyard, he couldn't help but look again at the garden.</p><p>Mr. Hong was most likely a Dan Dao master; the flowers he cultivated were probably rare and precious treasures.  Yet the garden contained only ordinary flowers.</p><p>He had initially expected some elaborate, undetectable array, but he discovered that these were indeed common flowers, including some of the most ordinary wildflowers from the fields.  Mr. Hong's presence was deep and subtle; he was certainly a remarkable person.  Could he also be undergoing a mortal life experience?</p><p>Perhaps Qin Sang's answer had pleased Mr. Hong.  Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Mr. Hong volunteered an explanation: "When one travels far, one looks back. These mortal plants are not as delicate as spiritual flowers and herbs; I can tend to them as I please. It's quite delightful…"</p><p>He pointed to a patch of rice flowers beside the garden.  "They say outside there is a struggle over Mahayana and Hinayana.  Daoist, if I could cultivate a superior rice, solving the world's hunger, could I be crowned a Sage of Agriculture?"</p><p>"No wonder the rice around Hanwan Town grows so exceptionally well," Qin Sang stated confidently. "If you truly accomplish this, you will certainly be crowned a sage, a sage to all peoples!"</p><p>But in his heart, he mused, perhaps the Mahayana Way does not lie in seeking kingship or ancestry.  If one could truly traverse these 'paths', one thing is certain: those who care for the common people and benefit the world will bring about earth-shattering changes.</p><p>The question was whether it was even possible.</p><p>"And what of being crowned a sage? Will it allow you and me to ascend to immortality?" Mr. Hong shook his head, waving his sleeve, revealing a path behind the hut and gesturing for Qin Sang to proceed up the mountain.</p><p>Seeing Mr. Hong's lack of desire for further conversation, Qin Sang refrained from speaking further. He casually chose a cave on the mountain, set up an array, and closed the door to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>He performed internal observation of his Qi Sea.</p><p>Twenty years had passed since his ascension tribulation, and the Tianmu Butterfly was still fast asleep, showing no signs of waking.  However, he could sense its energy becoming steadier, presumably digesting the power of the tribulation thunder.</p><p>After checking, Qin Sang continued his cultivation.</p><p>He would focus on improving his cultivation, but he would also continue to study the Four Symbols Sword Array.  In particular, once the Southern Vermillion Bird Sword Array was perfected, the combined might of two of the Four Symbols would be formidable.</p><p>Every time he studied the array, Qin Sang would awaken the Vermillion Bird and seek its assistance, and this time was no exception.</p><p>"You met Mr. Hong?" The Vermillion Bird awoke and immediately asked eagerly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>"Finally, I can witness the true Great Thousand World! Time flies, who knows what the Great Thousand World has become," the Vermillion Bird sighed, its tone filled with age-old wisdom, like an ancient elder who has lived through countless eons.</p><p>Qin Sang looked askance.  "Do you remember anything from before?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Zhu Que declared boldly,  "It's all your fault for being too slow!"</p><p>After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, Zhu Que's cultivation advanced rapidly.  Now, it's not far from the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>However, Zhu Que claims its potential is almost exhausted.  Its two true feathers and its previous reserves will likely be insufficient for a breakthrough to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>It may have to rely on arduous cultivation from now on, which it finds unacceptable.</p><p>"Are you sure?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Judging by Zhu Que's previous momentum, Qin Sang had expected to soon have another Void Refinement stage helper.</p><p>"I don't know!"</p><p>Zhu Que's words were tough, but it was somewhat dejected, clutching Qin Sang's sleeve and complaining repeatedly, "Why aren't you hurrying? How many years have passed already!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed; he also hoped to refine the Kirin Primal Seed as soon as possible.</p><p>Currently, facing cultivators of the same level, his spiritual sense offers no advantage and is even limited.  If he had consumed it recklessly, he might have already completed it. But Zhu Que's various demands have increased the difficulty many times over.</p><p>He had sensed the life fluctuation before, but the critical point hadn't arrived, and he wasn't sure how reliable Zhu Que's claims were, or if a Kirin egg could be hatched.</p><p>After the Kirin egg is born, it might take time to hatch.  Even a Void Refinement cultivator needs a long lifespan, otherwise, they would be worn out by the Kirin Primal Seed.</p><p>"Wait until you reach the peak of the Nascent Soul stage before we discuss this.  We'll try to help you break through to the Void Refinement stage then."</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice transmission, deploying the Derivative Sword Formation and instructing Zhu Que to enter.</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an unfamiliar aura in the mountain.  Leaving his cave dwelling, he saw a person wearing a hat.</p><p>The hat's veil obscured the person's face and entire upper body.  This person walked with their head bowed. The hat was a magical artifact, obscuring the person's aura, making it unclear.</p><p>Apparently not expecting anyone to be in the mountains, the hat-wearing person suddenly stopped upon seeing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, about to speak, but the hat-wearing person slightly returned the bow, said nothing, and hurriedly entered an empty hermitage, closing the door.</p><p>Qin Sang thought it was strange. With the artifact obscuring the person's aura, without using spells to probe, he couldn't determine the person's actual cultivation level.</p><p>It wasn't appropriate to investigate further in Mr. Hong's training grounds.</p><p>This person was probably also going to Da Zhou, and hopefully, they wouldn't cause any trouble along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the door for a while, then returned to his cave dwelling to continue cultivating.</p><p>The following year, another person entered the mountain.</p><p>This person was far more approachable than the hat-wearing person. Upon seeing Qin Sang, they greeted him enthusiastically, introducing themselves as Huai Ting, a cultivator of similar strength to Qin Sang.</p><p>As strangers meeting by chance, both knew their boundaries and didn't probe each other's origins.  Qin Sang only knew Huai Ting wasn't a cultivator of Ji Tian Peak.</p><p>"Daoist, are you also going to Da Zhou? I've long heard that the cultivation world of Ji Tian Peak is quite different from other places. I don't know when I'll be able to return. Since I'm passing through here, why not come and see it?" Huai Ting enthusiastically invited Qin Sang to go together.</p><p>Qin Sang thought that his current journey was precisely for travelling the vast world. His cultivation could wait, so he agreed.</p><p>The two informed Mr. Hong and set off together towards Ji Tian Peak.</p><p>Han Wan Town wasn't far from Ji Tian Peak; they flew leisurely and reached the foot of the mountain in two hours.</p><p>The eastern mountain silhouette could be seen from Han Wan Town. As they drew nearer, they could better appreciate the mountain's magnificence.</p><p>Layers of mountain ridges, varied landscapes.</p><p>The mountain contained wilderness, forests, rivers, lakes and marshes, as well as countless cities and shimmering lights—the locations of various cultivation sects.</p><p>So many mortals, cultivators, and sects gathered on one mountain, yet it didn't seem crowded.</p><p>The two admired it from afar for a while, concealed their cultivation, entered the mountain discreetly, and circled the mountain for several days, truly experiencing many unique aspects of Ji Tian Peak.</p><p>The Ji Tian Peak cultivation world is headed by the Ji Tian Palace.  Other sects also belong to the Ji Tian Palace.</p><p>These sects are called "So-and-so Palace," and their sect leaders have the right to participate in the Ji Tian Palace's council meetings, equivalent to holding a position in the Ji Tian Palace.</p><p>The organization is tighter than some alliances, but not like the Daoist schools, separating the Daoist courts and temples.</p><p>A sect is a branch of the Ji Tian Palace, exercising authority in a specific area.</p><p>The various sects are independent yet mutually constrained, forming a complex and unusual network that has functioned until now, leaving Qin Sang and Huai Ting astonished.</p><p>They ultimately did not reveal their identities, visiting the Ji Tian Palace for a tour before returning to Han Wan Town.</p><p>Unexpectedly, no one else came after that.</p><p>Until the tenth year of Qin Sang's arrival.</p><p>One morning, Qin Sang was awakened by a drumbeat.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the door, swiftly leaped to the mountaintop, and saw Mr. Hong holding a bronze drum, lightly tossing it. The drum expanded.</p><p>Besides Mr. Hong, there were only three of them.</p><p>"The three of you, please come up. The Canjin City official has arrived."</p><p>After the three boarded the drum, Mr. Hong controlled the drum and flew north, eventually flying out to sea.</p>
