<h1>Chapter 2119: The Twelve Thunder Gods' Summoning</h1><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying led their people into the Thunder Swamp, their every move within Qin Sang's perception.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang would, as Lu Wang and the others guessed, engage them, creating the illusion of desperately trying to stall for time.</p><p>His gaze went past Shi Mu and the others, toward the landmass on the sea. Anyone could see that this landmass was unusual, emitting subtle fluctuations that made Qin Sang wary.</p><p>Unfortunately, Si Lu didn't know much about the Lu family and the imperial clan, and was unaware of this landmass's origin.</p><p>It could be a unique artifact, a manifestation of divine powers, spiritual treasures, or formations, or even an unprecedented strange treasure.  Anything was possible.</p><p>What was certain was that the landmass had descended here, connecting with eight mountain peaks and the earth's energy. The occasional flickering of Xuanhuang light gave it an extremely weighty feeling. But this also meant it was bound; to move it, those connections would first have to be severed.</p><p>Without understanding the opponent's background, activating the Thunder Altar and unleashing the Sacrificial Thunder Oath wasn't a wise move.</p><p>Even if the mysterious landmass's power was weak, as long as it could withstand the Sacrificial Thunder Oath for a moment, the Grand Patron and the others would have a chance of survival.</p><p>Qin Sang had gained something from comprehending the Void-Breaking Spiritual Pagoda, and could now integrate the Sword-Rising Heart Sea technique into the activation of the Thunder Altar, but both this technique and the Pagoda were only effective if they hit the opponent.</p><p>Lu Wang and the others were hiding on the landmass, effectively creating an unknown barrier. Qin Sang either needed to investigate the landmass's nature or lure them out.</p><p>Feigning weakness to gradually lower the enemy's guard was a strategy that had always worked.</p><p>He withdrew his gaze and looked behind him. Cultivators and demon soldiers, led by the two Demon Marquises, were standing ready.</p><p>Most of the Storm Realm's strong cultivators were stationed in the branch altars; the remaining experts were limited, so Qin Sang had to be careful.</p><p>“Gui Hou! Luo Hou!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>The two Demon Marquises stepped forward, received their orders, and immediately selected over a hundred people to proceed with the thunder.</p><p>Simultaneously, at the main altar of the Qingyang Temple, Qin Sang's Dharma body silently activated the Thunder Altar.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Qingyang Temple was enveloped by a phantom altar, suspended in the air, extremely grand. Even the Thunder Altar's power displayed at Yue Du Bay couldn't compare to this.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body sat cross-legged atop the Thunder Altar, activating a thunder talisman inscribed within it.</p><p>A third-order talisman: the Twelve Thunder Gods' Summoning!</p><p>Daoism believes that there are different types of thunder, with various classifications. One reason is that when Daoism used thunder techniques as the foundation for building the Divine Court, it absorbed inheritances from various schools and sects.</p><p>Different sects, different inheritances, and different understandings of heaven, earth, and Daoist techniques, each with its own logic.</p><p>These inheritances didn't disappear. As Daoism grew stronger, each developed its own path, gradually merging into Daoism's thunder techniques system.</p><p>One theory divides thunder into thirty-six types, the thirty-six Thunder Gods of Heavenly Thunder.</p><p>Human sins are divided into personal sins, earthly sins, and thirty-six types of heavenly punishments. The Thunder Gods oversee the world, punishing evil and striking down criminals; mortals committing crimes would invite thunderous punishment. The Dao has the virtue of benevolence; sincere incense burning and prayer could alleviate such suffering.</p><p>This theory, tracing its roots, should originate from the most primitive worship of nature during humanity's ignorant past. Though Daoists now have a deeper understanding of the Dao, this inheritance remains, with the thirty-six Thunder Gods holding positions in the Divine Court and corresponding summoning techniques.</p><p>With the Divine Court hidden, Qin Sang couldn't summon divine assistance. But Daoist talismans are numerous. The Twelve Thunder Gods' Summoning, unlike a summoning technique, could achieve similar results in situations where the Divine Court couldn't be sensed.</p><p>The twelve Thunder Gods here refer to twelve human thunder gods. Above them are even more powerful earth and heavenly thunders, as well as the summoning of all thirty-six Thunder Gods, but Qin Sang hadn't received this inheritance. He suspected those summoning talismans were higher than third-order.</p><p>They are less talismans and more like talisman formations. The caster uses talismans, linking their power to individuals, usually in multiples of twelve. Through the Twelve Thunder Gods' Summoning, these individuals become one, transforming into twelve thunder gods under the talisman's power to fight.</p><p>After transforming, their strength is less related to their own cultivation and more to the caster, the talisman's quality, and its power.</p><p>With Qin Sang's casting and the Thunder Altar's empowerment, this was definitely a top-tier Twelve Thunder Gods' Summoning!</p><p>Qin Sang muttered incantations, and a ray of thunder appeared in the center of the altar, splitting into twelve points of light that rotated above his head.</p><p>Simultaneously, his will was transmitted through the altar formation to the branch altars. Si Lu and the others, not daring to be negligent, immediately cooperated in casting spells.</p><p>The altar masters below were the busiest, chanting incantations and performing ritual steps. Whether demon, witch, righteous cultivator, or those of heterodox paths, they all momentarily displayed the demeanor of Daoist masters.</p><p>Lei Tan activated. Twelve points of spiritual light stirred restlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang raised a hand, pointing westward, directing the twelve points of spiritual light towards the heavens.</p><p>Simultaneously, in the far west, Gui Hou, Luo Hou, and one hundred and twenty other cultivators felt thunder gather above their heads, then suddenly descend.</p><p>The cultivators, having been warned, remained calm and unmoved.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Blinding lightning engulfed them, followed by a vast power.  This power wasn't ostentatious; it didn't create a maelstrom.  After its arrival, it felt as deep and still as a dark pool.</p><p>The next moment, the lightning receded, revealing the cultivators, their appearance and bearing utterly transformed.</p><p>Led by Gui Hou and Luo Hou, the cultivators' complexions were various – blue, red, black, gold.  Some wore yellow headbands and green robes, others dark robes and golden armor.  Some wielded swords, others shackles; some held fire pearls and water wheels. Twelve distinct forms in all, mirroring the legendary twelve Thunder Gods.</p><p>Twelve thunder gods:  controlling plagues, capturing poisons, eliminating harm, averting misfortune, sealing mountains, destroying temples, subduing ghosts, vanquishing tigers, dispelling miasma, exterminating corpses, eliminating monsters, and governing spirits. Each was imposing, their eyes like copper bells, their power boundless!</p><p>As the thunder gods, they felt an unparalleled power, far surpassing their own cultivation.  Unlike summoning spirits, however, they couldn't control this power, nor receive guidance; they were merely vessels, needing to abandon self, maintain a pure heart, and submit to its control.</p><p>Gui Hou roared, the thunder gods responding with a sound like mountains collapsing, continuing their advance. The surrounding thunder retreated before them, as if encountering a sovereign.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying entered the Thunder Marsh, finding their vision filled with blinding, omnipresent lightning. Even with their cultivation, their spiritual senses were restricted, forcing caution.</p><p>Shi Mu halted, transmitting a message.  The nine Gui troops behind them stopped silently, awaiting orders.</p><p>After sensing their surroundings, Shi Mu and Shi Ying exchanged a glance and ordered a deeper advance.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Lightning danced wildly around them; thunder pythons periodically charged, the thunder deafening.  While spectacular, the power wasn't world-shattering; they easily withstood the lightning strikes.</p><p>Still, Shi Mu and his company didn't underestimate the situation. Their spiritual senses were increasingly suppressed, indicating that this lightning was no ordinary phenomenon.</p><p>The Thunder Marsh seemed endless. After an unknown distance, Shi Mu again ordered a halt.  They had encountered no one, nor suffered any ferocious attacks. The clamorous marsh felt strangely deathly still.</p><p>Sensing their inner connection, they found it unbroken by the marsh. Shi Mu relaxed, exchanging a private communication with Shi Ying.</p><p>Reaching this point, they sensed something unusual, though outwardly, nothing appeared amiss. They possessed powerful investigative techniques, but didn't want to reveal them prematurely, so they decided to have the nine Gui troops disperse, conducting separate investigations.</p><p>The nine Gui troops meticulously followed orders, splitting into several groups, fanning out deeper into the marsh.</p><p>Then, Shi Mu made a gesture at his waist.  With a *bang*, a cloud of white mist erupted from his palm, engulfing both him and Shi Ying.</p><p>The mist dissipated rapidly. When it cleared, both Shi Mu and Shi Ying had vanished.</p><p>The surrounding lightning, having lost its target, danced erratically.</p><p>Qin Sang, observing from afar, watched intently.  The disappearance of the two was clearly a sophisticated concealment technique.</p><p>This Thunder Marsh was Qin Sang's creation, primarily designed to suppress the opponents' spiritual senses, making them cautious, and masking their own movements; other functions were secondary.</p><p>However, Shi Mu and Shi Ying remained within Qin Sang's perception.</p><p>Their concealment, while masterful, couldn't escape the eyes of the Sky-seeing Butterfly!</p><p>After concealing themselves, Shi Mu and Shi Ying observed their surroundings. Finding nothing amiss, they quietly followed one of the nine Gui troops.</p><p>The thunder gods had arrived.</p><p>One small detachment of the nine Gui troops, led by a deputy commander whose face was obscured by a helmet, revealing only sharp, keen eyes, moved through the lightning. The surrounding 'silence' was unsettling.</p><p>Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck, seemingly no different from the others.  As the flanking cultivators prepared to defend as before, the deputy commander's face changed, shouting, "Evade!"</p><p>The cultivators reacted instantly, a gap appearing in their formation. The lightning's trajectory was exceptionally strange.</p><p>The deputy commander, somehow now holding a triangular green flag, shook it; green light spread, but it was too late.</p><p>Boom! Over a dozen people were struck by lightning before they could dodge, instantly vanishing into nothingness.  Among them were several peak experts at the Yuanjing Fourth Realm.</p><p>The power of the lightning caused the cultivators to gasp in shock.</p><p>Immediately after, a thunderous roar echoed from the source of the lightning, "Wicked ones, you shall be punished!"</p><p>The voice, filled with authority, sent a tremor through the cultivators' hearts.  They looked towards the sound, and saw a figure—a man in green robes, resembling a thunder god, wielding a thunder sword, glaring at them angrily.</p><p>The thunder god pointed his sword at the cultivators. The tip of the sword suddenly blazed brightly, and a bolt of lightning shot through the air.</p><p>Then, shouts rang out from all directions.</p><p>"Traitors, surrender!"</p><p>"Your crimes are unforgivable!"</p><p>In an instant, several thunder gods appeared one after another, their figures flashing past. Their appearances, weapons, and even the color of their lightning attacks differed, but the power of their attacks remained terrifying.</p><p>This small squad wasn't the only one under attack.</p><p>At that moment, the entire Jiu Gui Clan, including Shi Mu and Shi Ying, were surrounded by thunder gods from the sky, as if they were all criminals awaiting judgment.</p><p>Divine punishment rained down, devastating the land.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying's hearts tightened. Their plan to divide their forces was to break the stalemate and lure out their enemy. They had succeeded, but the ensuing attack was far beyond their expectations.</p><p>Fortunately, they were prepared. Shi Mu flipped his hand, revealing a triangular green flag in his palm. This was the main flag, far more exquisite and intricate than the deputy commanders' flags.</p><p>The Jiu Gui Clan had meticulously trained in several battle formations, and the strongest one required this magical flag. The higher the quality of the flag and the stronger the cultivator wielding it, the greater the power of the formation.</p><p>Shi Mu had already held the main flag since before entering the Lei Ze. Without hesitation, he activated it.</p><p>Whoosh! The flag soared into the air, and a green gale sprang up around it, transforming into a giant green dragon.  Simultaneously, above each squad, green dragons rose into the sky.</p><p>The area transformed into a dragon's nest.  The dragons, dancing together, surged upward to counter the divine punishment.</p><p>However, for some reason, despite their quick reaction, Shi Mu and Shi Ying both sensed something was amiss.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Trusting his intuition, Shi Mu immediately ordered the Jiu Gui Clan to fall back.</p><p>At that moment, Shi Ying's eyes widened in shock. A figure appeared out of thin air before them: Qin Zhenren!</p><p>They had heard about Lu Gan's encounter with this person.  Even with the Kuntian Golden Lock, Lu Gan had been defeated and fled.</p><p>"He's making his move in the first engagement. They truly lack strong fighters..."</p><p>This thought flashed through Shi Ying's mind as he stepped in front of Shi Mu, his brow radiating energy, summoning two companion beasts.</p><p>One was a feathered fierce bird similar to Si Lu's, and the other resembled a white tiger, but with a horn on its forehead and three tails.</p><p>With angry roars, the bird and tiger attacked Qin Sang from either side, one with flames, the other with sharp claws.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his Dharma form activated and secretly utilizing the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, swung his spirit tablet. Two resounding bangs echoed as the beasts were sent flying.</p><p>Then, in a flash of green light, Qin Sang moved with unimaginable speed, passing through the two beasts and instantly closing in on Shi Ying.</p><p>Shi Ying finally understood that Lu Gan hadn't been exaggerating; Qin Sang had a companion beast protecting him. His heart pounded.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying were psychically linked. Sensing his companion's unease, Shi Mu quickly diverted his attention, summoning his companion beast to aid.</p><p>At this point, both were fully engaged with Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the smile playing on Qin Sang's lips, Shi Mu froze, a bad feeling washing over him.</p><p>Boom! The thunder gods in the sky appeared together, standing atop the thunderclouds.</p><p>Like gods descending, their divine might was overwhelming.</p><p>"Demon, die!"</p><p>Divine punishment descended, thousands of thunderbolts striking at once. The dragons were instantly annihilated by the divine thunder, only the main flag's dragon managing to hold on.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The main flag shattered, and the entire squad was engulfed by the heavenly thunder.</p><p>Then the second flag, the third…</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying were both shocked. They hadn't expected the thunder gods to be so terrifying.  They could still fight, but the Jiu Gui Clan might be completely annihilated.</p><p>The Si You Clan's mutual transformation technique was more restrictive on lower-cultivation individuals.  Few would likely survive.</p><p>This was only the first engagement, and the Jiu Gui Clan had been decimated. How would they explain this to King Lu?</p><p>Shi Mu frantically activated the tremor within his body.</p>
