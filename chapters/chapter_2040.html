<h1>Chapter 2031: Witch Curse</h1><p>Everything Young Mistress Xin said was from her perspective, and Qin Sang naturally wouldn't completely believe her.</p><p>He did need manpower under his command. Within human territories, demon lords like Luo Hou faced many restrictions.  As for whether or not to subdue the Xin Clan, it required careful consideration.  What Qin Sang cared about most right now was the secret hidden deep within the grand formation.</p><p>As they spoke, the destructive storm at the center intensified, and the strange phenomenon in the depths of the formation became increasingly prominent.</p><p>Multicolored lights constantly gushed from the darkness. The light didn't diffuse outwards, but surged and transformed within a radius of several dozen zhang, resembling a kaleidoscope within, or perhaps a passage.</p><p>The transformation wasn't over yet.  From the depths of the passage, something seemed about to emerge. Qin Sang waited, and Young Mistress Xin knew he was waiting.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin's pleas did have some effect.  Her tactful behavior spared her from interrogation.</p><p>“What is the origin of this place?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked directly, certain that Young Mistress Xin knew.</p><p>She could control the self-destruction of this grand formation.  Not knowing its origin would be a huge joke.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin knew this as well, and replied without hesitation, “Senior must have noticed. This place is related to the Witch Clan.  It's an ancient Witch Clan ruin. This formation is an ancient Witch Formation, vastly different from human inheritances. Because of this, neither Venerable Pei nor Recluse Zhong Liang discovered the hidden dangers within.  They never imagined that this junior could manipulate the formation's self-destruction, otherwise they wouldn't have fallen into the trap so easily.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.  Not only Venerable Pei and Recluse Zhong Liang, but even he hadn't noticed anything before the formation's self-destruction.</p><p>The *Panhu True Scripture* recorded some Witch Clan inheritances, but they mostly pertained to Insect Control techniques, with little mention of Witch Formations.</p><p>After a pause, Young Mistress Xin continued, “I dare not hide anything from Senior. This isn't the secret realm my father discovered. Rather, while secretly searching for secret realms in the Fengju Jade Gate, following my father's dying wish, I encountered a Ghostly Thunder explosion and stumbled into this place by accident. I unexpectedly obtained the stone talisman that controls the grand formation, which led to the subsequent plan.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang examined Young Mistress Xin with a scrutinizing gaze, surprised that she would reveal such a secret.</p><p>Venerable Pei had always believed this was the secret realm the Xin Clan painstakingly sought. If he knew the truth in the afterlife, who knows how he would feel.</p><p>However, that secret realm could attract Soul Formation cultivators, and might have been the Xin Clan's last chance to defy fate.</p><p>To hand over this lifeline, did she truly give up resisting and sincerely wish to submit to him?</p><p>“The secret realm my father discovered could indeed help improve our Xin Clan’s strength.  It should allow our clan's secret techniques to evolve and their power to greatly increase, raising the cultivation level of every Xin Clan cultivator.  However, it wouldn't be enough to change our clan's predicament. In truth, besides our Xin Clan, that secret realm likely held little value in the eyes of Venerable Pei, Recluse Zhong Liang, and Elder Qin. This junior deliberately exaggerated its importance.  They were deceived by the lies I fabricated, which is why they tolerated this junior and the Xin Clan until now.”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin spoke casually, but Qin Sang understood the danger involved.  Lies are easy to tell, but it's difficult to have two Soul Formation cultivators believe them.  Navigating between them must have been like walking on thin ice.</p><p>Of course, lies alone weren't enough. Without the Nether Spirit, the Xin Clan would have been devoured long ago.  They must have assessed the situation and realized that rash action wasn't worth it. With the added element of mutual restraint, Young Mistress Xin found room to maneuver.</p><p>“My father said that opening the secret realm requires the assistance of a Formation Master. Elder Qin will know then that this junior's invitation was sincere.”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin revealed her true purpose. After this long detour, she was still explaining to Qin Sang that she harbored no ill will.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious about how Young Mistress Xin could face him after losing the Nether Spirit. However, at that time, he hadn't known about the Nether Spirit's demise.  After witnessing Young Mistress Xin eliminate Venerable Pei and Recluse Zhong Liang, he would certainly be apprehensive.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin must have calculated this, but she failed to account for the Thousand Kilograms Ring!</p><p>Qin Sang only nodded, staring into the depths of the grand formation, and remained silent.</p><p>Seeing him unmoved, Young Mistress Xin could only follow Qin Sang’s gaze and softly said, “Is Elder Qin familiar with Witch Curses?”</p><p>“Witch Curses?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.</p><p>He had seen a few insect-controlling Witch Curses in the *Panhu True Scripture*, but he wasn't a member of the Witch Clan and couldn't use them.</p><p>“Legend has it that when Heaven and Earth first opened, Primordial Divine Spirits were born, the very first beings.  They were formed from the Heavenly Dao, inheriting the fortune of Heaven and Earth. The Witch Clan claims to be descendants of these Primordial Divine Spirits…”</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently to Young Mistress Xin’s following words.</p><p>Although most of what she said came from legends, on certain levels, they corroborated the records in the *Panhu True Scripture*.</p><p>The Witch Clan claimed to be descendants of the Primordial Divine Spirits. Because they carried the bloodline of Divine Spirits, they were born favored by Heaven and Earth, endowed with innate divine knowledge, understanding things without being taught, and comprehending things without explanation.</p><p>Witch Curses were a manifestation of this ability.</p><p>Witch Curses and Daoist incantations, both being forms of 'curses', seemed similar in invoking Heaven and Earth through mystical words, yet they were fundamentally different.</p><p>Daoist incantations required prior cultivation, achieving sufficient mastery before casting them.</p><p>Among humans, regardless of Talisman Schools, Alchemy Schools, Buddhist, Daoist, or Demonic cultivators, the concept of cultivation was similar: Techniques, Methods, and the Dao, progressing sequentially.</p><p>Techniques, compared to the Dao, represented the practical application.</p><p>As the saying goes, the essence is the foundation of application, and application is the movement of essence.</p><p>Human cultivators cultivated methods to comprehend the Dao, first gaining insight from the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth, understanding the "why" before the "how," thus comprehending Daoist techniques for their own use.</p><p>The Witch Clan was the opposite.  Witch Curses were a manifestation of 'techniques'.  They seemed to have an innate closeness to the Dao, able to invoke the power of Heaven and Earth through curses without understanding the reasons, or even the principles involved.</p><p>Legends told of Witch Curses capable of killing enemies across vast distances, their power mysterious and unpredictable.  From this perspective, the Witch Clan might indeed be descendants of Primordial Divine Spirits, which fostered their unique cultivation system.</p><p>This was also why it was so difficult for the Witch Clan of the Canglang Sea to cultivate human methods after losing their inheritance.</p><p>“Are there Witch Curses here?”</p><p>Qin Sang focused his senses.  The fluctuations emitted by the multicolored light were indeed unlike anything he had ever encountered.</p><p>“Indeed, a Blessing Curse might be sealed here,” Young Mistress Xin nodded.</p><p>Among Witch Curses, there were categories such as Praising, Blessing, and Killing Curses, each with different power and purpose.</p><p>Blessing implied support and enhancement.</p><p>As the name suggested, Praising and Blessing Curses originated from Witch Clan rituals.  Unlike Killing Curses, those who received Blessing Curses often benefited from them.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed.  “What kind of Blessing Curse?”</p><p>“Actually, this junior hasn't gained much. After discovering the function of this Witch Formation, I focused on plotting how to lure Venerable Pei and Recluse Zhong Liang here. This Witch Formation acts as a seal.  The secrets within will only be revealed once the seal is opened.  This junior was worried about leaving traces that might affect the plan and didn’t dare to open it easily, so I don't know for sure, but there are certainly great benefits.  This junior is willing to invoke this curse for Senior, only hoping to appease Senior's anger and for Senior to seriously consider this junior’s proposal.”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin said respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Young Mistress Xin, knowing this was her pledge of allegiance.</p><p>With a Witch Clan altar, sacrificial insects, a Witch Formation, and a Witch Curse, this was undoubtedly a Witch Clan ruin.</p><p>Qin Sang turned the Thousand Kilograms Ring on his thumb. It seemed this ring was also inextricably linked to the Witch Clan.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed the changes in the depths of the formation intensifying. Layers of light waves surged, like an invisible door opening in the void, finally revealing a glimpse of what lay within.</p><p>Faintly, Qin Sang saw a corner of an ancient stone hall.</p><p>Massive stones, rough surfaces, ancient patterns – this style was very similar to the Witch Clan altar outside, clearly from the same lineage.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>It was unclear whether the tremors were from the destruction of the formation or the emergence of the ancient hall, but they shook the entire space.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The pent-up multicolored light suddenly erupted. Multicolored light waves swept across all directions, dispelling the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swiftly scanned the void.  Wherever the multicolored light waves passed, hidden objects were revealed.  The fluctuations from the Thousand Kilograms Ring indicated that these were other scattered fragments.</p><p>Strangely, there was no resonance between the location of the stone hall and the Thousand Kilograms Ring, contrary to Qin Sang's expectations. He had originally thought this stone hall was also a part of the Thousand Kilograms Ring's world.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>With wave after wave of light, the stone hall slowly rose from the ‘passage,’ becoming increasingly clear.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin also saw the stone hall, a fervent glint flashing in her eyes.</p><p>It was a simple and majestic stone hall, with dozens of circular stone pillars standing on all four sides. Even the dome was constructed from enormous stone slabs, supported by the stone pillars. The stone walls and stone door were also unpolished giant stones, exuding a raw, untamed aura.</p><p>There were three stone steps in front of the stone hall, each a zhang high. The stone hall itself was even more imposing. Patterns were carved on the surfaces of the stone pillars and walls, but the strokes were too simple to decipher their meaning.</p><p>They arrived before the passage, gazing up at the stone hall.  A mysterious, ancient aura washed over them, stirring their minds and evoking a strange sensation, an urge to prostrate themselves in worship.</p><p>There were no statues here.  They weren't worshipping deities, but Heaven and Earth itself, as if this stone hall embodied Heaven and Earth.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin exhaled deeply, shaking off the impulse. She instinctively wanted to ascend the stone steps, but suddenly remembered something, her figure pausing as she looked at Qin Sang beside her.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept over the murals, frowning as he pondered their meaning, trying to find corresponding information in the *Panhu True Scripture*, but with little success. He remembered Ghost Mother mentioning that there were countless tribes within the Witch Clan, and the inheritances between tribes varied greatly.</p><p>He noticed a circular depression in the center of the stone door, containing a pattern resembling orchid grass, perhaps the totem of this particular tribe.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang didn't ascend the steps.  Instead, he slowly levitated, his eyes level with the stone hall.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin could only follow Qin Sang and fly up.</p><p>The stone door was also an uneven stone slab, not seamlessly joined with the walls. The larger gaps were wide enough to insert a finger, but it was impossible to peek inside the stone hall through them.</p><p>As it hadn't fully emerged from the passage, the stone hall continued to tremble, but the stone door showed no sign of opening.</p><p>“Is the Blessing Curse sealed within this hall?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin nodded.  “It should be.”</p><p>“Only you can open the stone hall?” Qin Sang’s eyes sharpened.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin’s expression remained calm as she met Qin Sang’s piercing gaze. “That talisman stone has recognized this junior as its master.  Besides this junior, no one should be able to open the stone door.  If Senior doesn't believe me, you can try it yourself.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>He could naturally see that this hall, like the tomb outside, was surrounded by ancient restrictions, but far more complex and mysterious than the tomb’s entrance.  He channeled his True Essence into his palm and pushed, but the door remained unmoved.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't possibly allow Young Mistress Xin to open the door herself.</p><p>The seal within the stone hall might not be a Blessing Curse. Was Young Mistress Xin trying her utmost to gain his trust just for this opportunity?</p><p>There was indeed a significant disparity in their strength. Qin Sang could easily capture and interrogate Young Mistress Xin.</p><p>But if it was truly as she said, requiring her to personally open the door, even if Qin Sang placed restrictions on her and controlled her to open it, there was no guarantee of absolute safety.</p><p>Such a scenario wasn't impossible.</p><p>Learning from Venerable Pei's lesson, when faced with an unknown Witch Clan ruin, Qin Sang couldn't give Young Mistress Xin any opportunity.</p><p>He would rather leave the stone hall unopened than let Young Mistress Xin open the door.</p><p>Thinking of the Thousand Kilograms Ring, Qin Sang glanced at the locations of its fragments.  Since the ring was inextricably linked to this place, perhaps retrieving all the fragments would reveal a solution, making Young Mistress Xin unnecessary.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang glanced at Young Mistress Xin and said indifferently, “Have you finished?”</p><p>“Elder Qin, you…”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin instinctively took two steps back.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and reached out towards her.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang moved to restrain Young Mistress Xin, the stone hall suddenly trembled violently.</p><p>‘Creak!’</p><p>The sound of grinding stones reached their ears, clear and distinct. Qin Sang abruptly turned and saw the stone door opening a crack amidst the tremors.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>“Gao!”</p><p>A strange incantation echoed from within the stone hall.</p><p>This incantation consisted of only one bizarre syllable, yet it contained boundless meaning, like a sound from the ancient era, traversing countless years.</p><p>In an instant, both Qin Sang and Young Mistress Xin were stunned.</p><p>Ancient, vast, desolate, timeless…</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to see a vision: a vast, wild plain at dusk, covered with lush vegetation and rolling mountains.  Beasts roamed the plain, emitting primal howls.</p><p>He stood atop a high mountain, below him an ancient altar, surrounded by countless burning torches.  The firelight illuminated the scene, revealing dark figures prostrating themselves below the altar.</p><p>These people, led by someone in strange attire, knelt devoutly towards the altar, chanting the same syllable.</p><p>“Gao!”</p><p>“Gao!”</p><p>…</p><p>The vast incantation, brimming with endless power, reverberated through the mountains.</p><p>The beasts fell silent, and Heaven and Earth trembled.</p><p>Protected by the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang's mind remained clear, not lost to the incantation's power.  He instinctively wanted to retreat, but then abruptly stopped, shock and joy appearing on his face.</p><p>At this moment, he finally understood the meaning of the incantation. Young Mistress Xin hadn't lied.  It truly was a Blessing Curse!</p><p>Witch Curses required a Witch to cast, but the recipient didn't need to be a Witch.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped retreating, immersing himself in comprehending the Blessing Curse.</p><p>He even awakened the two Demon Lords within the altar, the Fire Jade Centipede, the Vermilion Bird, and the Celestial Eye Butterfly within his Qi Sea!</p>
