<h1>Chapter 1603: Stolen Treasure</h1><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>Qin Sang followed Jiang You into the inner hall of the residence.  He saw a human-sized wooden stand with a large gong hanging from its crossbeam.  </p><p>This gong had three faces.  </p><p>Without anyone touching it, the gong swayed on its own, emitting a faint yellow aura.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, sensing the presence of a spirit array nearby; part of its energy converged on the gong.</p><p>“This treasure is called the Seven-Sound Gong. It’s a unique Buddhist artifact. The hall master bought it for a hefty price after the incident at the last treasure exchange,” Jiang You explained.</p><p>He drew a ‘卍’ character in mid-air and flicked it toward the gong. It vanished into the yellow light. The gong hummed, suddenly stopping its swaying and the light subsided; however, its connection to the spirit array became even more subtle.</p><p>“We set up a corresponding array nearby.  This treasure is extremely sensitive to energy fluctuations. It’s to prevent anyone with malicious intent at the auction and treasure exchange, especially those with demonic energy.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, secretly chuckling that the Six States Hall had learned its lesson after being bitten by a snake.</p><p>Last time, a demon infiltrated the treasure exchange, causing the Six States Hall great embarrassment and becoming a laughingstock.  Repeating the same mistake would only make them a bigger joke.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't involved in the internal affairs of the hall; his only duty was to appear at the auctions and treasure exchanges.</p><p>After Jiang You left, Qin Sang stayed in his cave for a while before leaving the Six States Hall branch and wandering aimlessly through Hong City.</p><p>The first grand auction would be held the day after tomorrow morning, divided into Golden Core and Nascent Soul stages. Auctions for low-level cultivators had already started several days ago in the southern city, with unlimited sessions.</p><p>All Nascent Soul cultivators in Hong City received invitations, including Qin Sang.</p><p>The treasure list hadn't been released yet, but the grand air of the Golden Jade Sect had everyone highly anticipating the event.</p><p>Hong City was overflowing with people.</p><p>Unconsciously, Qin Sang found himself walking towards the main peak.</p><p>He encountered several Nascent Soul Grandmasters, usually a rare sight, soon after arriving.  A few others had concealed auras, possibly Nascent Soul mid-stage or higher cultivators.</p><p>Hong City was a den of hidden dragons and tigers.  Rashly using his divine sense to probe would easily cause misunderstandings.</p><p>Qin Sang simply treated it as sightseeing, avoiding contact with others, slowly walking to the summit of the main peak and looking out from the railing.</p><p>The main peak was the center of the Jiangbei mountain range, overlooking countless mountains to the west and boundless ocean to the east; a truly magnificent view.</p><p>A nine-story building, resplendent with gold and jade, stood proudly atop the main peak, a testament to ultimate luxury, known as the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the Golden Jade Tower was the Golden Jade Sect's property, and the grand auction would be held there.</p><p>Qin Sang had little contact with the Golden Jade Sect, but from past rumors and his own observations, he felt it was more like a commercial organization than a cultivation sect; even more ostentatious than the Six States Hall.</p><p>Perhaps the Golden Jade Sect had unique traditions.</p><p>Cultivation techniques could alter a cultivator's temperament, affecting the atmosphere of the entire sect.</p><p>Passing by the Golden Jade Tower, Qin Sang glanced at it but had no intention of entering.  As he was about to leave, his brows furrowed slightly.</p><p>He seemed to have sensed a prying gaze upon him.</p><p>With his significantly improved divine sense and sharp spiritual perception, Qin Sang knew it wasn't an illusion.  This gaze was different from others; the observer was intensely focused on him!</p><p>He quickly took in the surroundings of the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>To the right of the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>A Nascent Soul female cultivator was walking with a handsome young man.</p><p>The young man was only at the Golden Core mid-stage, seemingly unaware of the female cultivator's true cultivation, acting frivolous and carefree. The female cultivator played along, appearing charming and looking at him with admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a cold glint in the female cultivator's eyes. Remembering some rumors about the Demon Sect's Fallen Heaven Valley, he thought the young man's fate wouldn't be good if he didn't wake up soon.</p><p>A Taoist priest, dressed like a master from the Quiet Zen Villa, came out of the Golden Jade Tower. He glanced at the female cultivator but didn't interfere, then, using strange movements, disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>Two levels down the stairs, a Nascent Soul couple were whispering sweet nothings.</p><p>...</p><p>One by one, the images of cultivators passed through Qin Sang's mind, each one eliminated.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly was also silently using its abilities.</p><p>Everything seemed normal!</p><p>“An illusion?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe his spiritual perception was wrong, but the person had indeed vanished, or their disguise was so masterful that even he couldn't see through it.</p><p>He maintained his pace, calmly walking past the Golden Jade Tower, touring the other peaks before returning to the Six States Hall residence.  Night had fallen, and the feeling hadn't reappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped thinking about it and began organizing his storage ring.</p><p>He only had one Soul-Subduing Incense stick left. The two crocodile corpses should fetch a good price. He could also sell the formula for the Soul-Subduing Incense, but he needed to save it for a more crucial moment.</p><p>He observed that even in the wealthy Central Plains, gathering all the necessary ingredients for the Spirit-Calming Incense was incredibly difficult.  Few could afford the ingredients, let alone possess the skill to refine the incense.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to gather the rarest ingredients first when she had the time, before considering selling the formula.</p><p>The moon hung like a veil.  Qin Sang gazed out at the quiet courtyard, deep in thought.  Suddenly, a gong shattered the silence!</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>Three bronze gongs sounded together.  The clear sound echoed throughout the entire outpost. The Seven-Note Gong!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.  She rose abruptly and appeared instantly above the courtyard.  Simultaneously, figures rushed from various locations; the Six States Hall experts were awakened, their eyes fixed on the Hall's back building.</p><p>That was where the Six States Hall treasury was located, guarded personally by Deputy Hall Master Jiang You!</p><p>A brilliant yellow light erupted from the back building, accompanied by the urgent clang of the gongs. A white figure flickered silently within the yellow light, graceful as a crane, ghostlike in its movements.</p><p>From the back building came Deputy Hall Master Jiang You's furious roar, "Stop him!"</p><p>Simultaneously, panicked shouts erupted from within.</p><p>"No! The Sky Vault is open!"</p><p>"The seals have been broken…"</p><p>…</p><p>The Sky Vault, the Six States Hall's primary treasury, had been infiltrated silently.  Only the Seven-Note Gong alarm revealed the thief’s presence.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The white figure's movements were incredibly swift and subtle; with a flash, they vanished into the void outside the mountains.</p><p>Jiang You only then burst from the back building, his robes torn, trailing shimmering threads, his appearance disheveled—clearly hindered by the intruder’s abilities.  Enraged, seeing the figure escape, he looked towards Qin Sang's cave.  Finding it empty, he relaxed slightly and ordered, "Quickly pursue! Go assist Elder Qin!"</p><p>Leaving most of his men, including Jiang Mu, to guard the treasury, Jiang You led the others in pursuit.</p><p>The commotion alerted nearby cultivators; onlookers secretly followed.  Golden Jade Sect patrol cultivators, noticing the disturbance, immediately used jade talismans to contact their senior masters, urging their spirit beasts towards the scene.</p><p>In the lead, the white figure's escape technique, while skillful, was no match for Qin Sang.  Shortly after leaving Hong City, Qin Sang caught up.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted. A sword arc shot from the Qianjun Ring. The Jinchen Sword, swift as a shooting star, erupted in a thousand-zhang beam of sword light, a river of sword energy cleaving the air.</p><p>The white figure seemed to glance back at Qin Sang, then, facing the descending sword light, swept their sleeve. Without using any apparent weapon, a violent wind arose; visible grey gusts coalesced into a swirling mass of ominous grey wind, sweeping down like a storm.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The river of sword energy crashed into the monstrous wind, like white-hot iron, relentlessly piercing it, flashing brilliantly within the wind's core. The wind raged, grey gusts lashing out at the sword light, forming solid-looking shackles that wrapped around it, layer upon layer.</p><p>"Late Yuan Ying stage!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, confirming the opponent's cultivation.</p><p>While the Six States Hall treasury held many treasures, items that would truly tempt a powerful cultivator wouldn't be stored there. For a grand cultivator to stoop to stealing these relatively minor treasures, only to be caught red-handed, seemed illogical.</p><p>"The treasures I brought to Hong City were intended for auction. If you desire any, simply ask; I would gladly give them to you, no charge needed.  Why resort to theft?"</p><p>Qin Sang called out loudly. A few items were a small price to pay for befriending such a powerful cultivator; she believed Hall Master Mu would see the wisdom in this.</p><p>"I take what I want."</p><p>The white figure scoffed.  Their laughter was somewhat distorted, for seeing the sword light fail to stop the figure, Qin Sang altered her sword technique. The Jinchen Sword vanished, plunging the area into darkness, trapping the monstrous wind within a void.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Array deployed, the wind, now directionless, thrashed wildly within the sword array, disintegrating under the relentless attacks of the sword threads.  The sword threads flashed, instantly annihilating the final wisp of wind. Before the white figure could escape, Qin Sang enveloped the area, trapping them just in time.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind her. The disturbance had been quite substantial.  Besides Jiang You and his men, many more figures were approaching, their light illuminating the night sky outside Hong City, far behind the two combatants. Qin Sang noted several golden lights among them – the Golden Jade Sect's unique escape technique. She nodded; she had been waiting for them.  With a disturbance in Hong City, the Golden Jade Sect had a duty to respond.</p><p>Qin Sang acted only as a guest elder should, he had no intention of fighting to the death for the Six States Hall and a Grand Cultivator. Delaying the opponent to allow pursuers to arrive was already more than enough.</p><p>Besides, Qin Sang remembered the feeling of being watched that day.</p><p>That night, a Grand Cultivator infiltrated the Six States Hall.</p><p>Coincidence?</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Sky-Eye Butterfly to secretly guard the surroundings; for now, nothing unusual was detected.</p><p>“Your sword formation is not bad, but your execution is terrible!  Your swordsmanship is amateurish!”</p><p>Trapped in the formation, the white figure showed no sign of panic, instead sneering and taunting.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond,</p><p>‘嗖嗖嗖’ piercing sounds echoed from within the sword formation.  Transparent threads shot out from the white figure, identical to those used against Jiang You.</p><p>It was clear the white figure hadn't used their full strength against Jiang You.</p><p>The threads wove a strange spectacle around the figure; countless threads intertwined, forming a lake suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The lake water was clear, just like a real lake.</p><p>‘哗!’</p><p>The surface swelled, and a water giant emerged from the lake, its empty eyes fixed on the countless sword threads.  It roared, raised its arm, twisted its body, and smashed a powerful punch into the sword formation!</p><p>The force of the punch was like thunder.</p><p>Instantly, the sword formation shook violently, chaos ensuing.</p><p>Qin Sang's face grew serious; he quickly chanted incantations, the sword threads frantically retracting, compressing the power of the formation to repair the damage caused by the punch.</p><p>But the white figure had seized the opportunity, suddenly appearing above the water giant, rapidly ascending.  Facing the converging sword threads, calmly and unhurriedly, it pointed to another part of the formation and softly said, “This formation should be used by me!”</p><p>That was the spot hit by the water giant, where the sword formation's power had yet to recover, the sword threads in disarray.</p><p>At these words,</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified to find that the sword threads had completely broken free from his control, their connection severed. Though not the entire formation, only that area, it was a fatal flaw.</p><p>Even more shockingly, the white figure beckoned with a finger, and those sword threads were controlled by the figure, turning against their ‘companions.’</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation was split from within, the sword threads battling each other.</p><p>The white figure remained composed.</p><p>“Full of flaws!”</p><p>The white figure's scornful laughter reached Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, unable to refute.</p><p>After the sword formation was completed, trapped enemies had always only been able to defend. This was the first time it had been broken by such a bizarre method.</p><p>The water giant was comprehensible, but Qin Sang couldn't understand the white figure’s final technique at all.</p><p>Unheard of!</p><p>‘嗖!’</p><p>The white figure burst from the sword formation, unharmed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, instead of fleeing, it turned, standing in the void, staring at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, sensing something was wrong, thinking inwardly, ‘Not good!’  He frantically flapped his phoenix wings, transforming into a flash of lightning, instantly shifting thousands of meters away.</p><p>The moment he moved, the white figure appeared in his former position.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced a similar situation fighting the Green-haired Rat Demon, but the white figure's movement was far more subtle and effortless, making it hard to guard against.</p><p>‘吼!’</p><p>The water giant roared.</p><p>Punch after punch shattered the sword threads, its power astonishing.</p><p>The white figure could only control the sword threads temporarily.</p><p>Qin Sang forcefully regained control of the sword formation, trapping the water giant, and focused on the white figure. The black lotus in his brow shone, the Demon Fire Dragon reappeared, striking directly at the void to Qin Sang’s left.</p><p>With a thunderous ‘轰’,</p><p>Ripples appeared in the void, revealing the white figure’s shadow.  Hit by the demon fire, the figure shattered like a mirror, then consumed by the flames, utterly destroyed.</p><p>The white figure used its old trick, but Qin Sang had turned it against them.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's face showed no joy. The white figure's abilities were too strange; it couldn't have been killed so easily.</p><p>He was vigilant, scanning his surroundings.</p><p>The next moment, a small mountain below trembled, a massive footprint appearing out of thin air. The white figure materialized above the footprint, its figure swaying slightly, floating back more than ten meters, landing steadily, robes flowing.</p><p>It had used some technique to dissipate the force of the demon fire.</p><p>The small mountain suffered; the rocks at the top were crushed by the footprint, and the entire mountaintop cracked from the footprint, the fissure reaching the base, with springs gushing forth.</p><p>Their two clashes had occurred in an instant.</p><p>It seemed neither had gained the upper hand, but Qin Sang knew how dangerous the opponent was. He had been forced to use the demon fire but was only able to defend, causing him to consider retreat.</p><p>The white figure stood still, glancing behind.</p><p>The pursuers were approaching.</p><p>It seemed unwilling to continue fighting Qin Sang, ceasing its attack, and making a hand seal. The water giant, still battling the sword formation, stiffened, melting into a pool of water.</p><p>Then, the light on the white figure's face flickered, its features gradually becoming clearer, revealing it to be a beautiful woman in court dress.</p><p>The woman examined Qin Sang, her eyes fixed on the jade pendant at his waist.</p><p>“You have some skill. No wonder you were able to pass through the storm and come from the North Sea.”</p>
