<h1>Chapter 1832: Mid-Nascent Soul Stage</h1><p>Fleshly Dharma Manifestation!</p><p>During his contemplation, Qin Sang gradually understood the true essence of the Sun Wheel Seal.  Once a cultivator casts this seal, mobilizing their entire body's vital essence to enact the method of the Golden Sun with their blood and qi, the sun shines upon the world, unleashing terrifying power.</p><p>It incinerates mountains and boils the sea, its might unparalleled!</p><p>Having newly acquired this inheritance, he only grasped the surface, yet he could already foresee the terrifying power of a perfected Sun Wheel Seal.  A slightly weaker opponent would likely be incinerated to ashes on the spot, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>This is a seal of slaughter, surpassing even the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his earlier speculation: the Great Vajra Wheel Seal excels in its comprehensiveness, while the other seals likely have certain biases, similar to the Inner Lion Seal.  The Sun Wheel Seal confirmed this.</p><p>Refining this seal doesn't significantly improve one's cultivation, but it grants a powerful defensive ability.</p><p>However, this seal differs from the Inner Lion Seal. The Inner Lion Seal's power lies in healing and recovery; though equally profound, it's not complex.  With guidance from Master Huaiyin back then, Qin Sang mastered the Inner Lion Seal quickly.</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal is different. Its complexity is in no way inferior to the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, especially in the subtle aspects of circulating vital essence and mobilizing blood and qi, surpassing it even.</p><p>He has no powerful cultivator to help him dissect this seal; he can only comprehend it himself.  The monk's image on the seventh level only serves to transmit the dharma, while the eighteen bronze statues on the sixth level serve as a mere guide to the seal's fundamentals.</p><p>Success depends entirely on one's comprehension.</p><p>The nine Great Luminous Seals share interconnected essences.  Qin Sang, having already refined the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, believed he should be able to refine the Sun Wheel Seal, but he couldn't estimate how long it would take.</p><p>"Fleshly Dharma Manifestation... Manifestation... Dharma..."</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, a sudden inspiration struck him.  Since it's a fleshly dharma manifestation, could he mobilize true essence to strengthen the Golden Sun's power, or even simultaneously mobilize his Dharma Body cultivation?</p><p>This idea, once conceived, lingered. It wasn't baseless. Qin Sang himself cultivates both Dharma Body and True Essence, and the Sun Wheel Seal provided this inspiration.</p><p>During his lower cultivation stages, Qin Sang had seen more than one dual cultivation technique, though rudimentary and with uncertain prospects, proving that people continuously explored this path.</p><p>If lower-level cultivators did it, higher-level masters would certainly do it too. When one reaches a dead end on a path, they will try other routes, making analogies, or even eclectically integrating them.</p><p>The vast world must contain top-tier dual-cultivation techniques, even triple-cultivation techniques involving Spirit, Dharma Body, and True Essence!</p><p>Compared to creating a new technique, creating dharma abilities that integrate Dharma Body and True Essence might be easier.</p><p>The nine Great Luminous Seals are all different, each seal representing the peak of a certain aspect of physical cultivation.</p><p>Would the predecessors who created the Buddha seals have attempted this?</p><p>Qin Sang believed it highly possible, but his current attainment wasn't sufficient to verify it.</p><p>He kept this thought in mind.  His next step was to focus on comprehending this seal before considering other things, though this idea gave him a direction for understanding the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>"Huu..."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru let out a long sigh, revealing a look of lingering delight, seemingly lost in the seal's essence.</p><p>Qin Sang then snapped out of it, looking at Venerable Zhenru, who was still savoring the experience, and smiled, "With this seal, Daoist friend will be divinely assisted.  Your next heavenly tribulation will be no obstacle."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru stood and bowed deeply to Qin Sang, "This monk is dull-witted.  Thanks to the true transmission of the seal, it's all thanks to the Daoist master. This monk and all of Jingtai Temple are eternally grateful."</p><p>Smiling, Qin Sang stood, "Why does Venerable say such things?  I, too, have witnessed a true Buddha, a benefit for life."</p><p>This was their agreed-upon exchange: Qin Sang helped Jingtai Temple open the Buddha pagoda, which also benefited himself.</p><p>The seventh-level space contained only the dharma-transmitting illusory figure, no jade slips or magical treasures.  Not even a simple record; they didn't even know the dharma name or origin of that dharma-transmitting sage.</p><p>The two could only bow to the void.</p><p>Having received the true transmission, there was no need to stay in the pagoda; they could return and comprehend it slowly.</p><p>Before leaving, Venerable Zhenru hesitated, "Dare I ask, Daoist master, can the *Seven Masters Buddha Seals* be passed on?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, having anticipated this question.</p><p>The *Seven Masters Buddha Seals* and the Great Vajra Wheel Seal are deeply related.  Whether or not it helps in comprehending the Sun Wheel Seal, Venerable Zhenru certainly wanted to obtain it.</p><p>Unfortunately, this seal was extraordinary; a true Great Luminous Seal, of immense value in Qin Sang's eyes.  Jingtai Temple might have to offer a spiritual treasure in exchange for it.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "After every few years, I will visit your esteemed monks to discuss the Dao, how about that?"</p><p>Disappointment flickered in Venerable Zhenru's eyes; Qin Sang's words indicated his stance: he wouldn't easily pass it on.</p><p>What treasures could Jingtai Temple offer to sway him?</p><p>Venerable Zhenru surveyed the temple's treasury, only to sigh, clasped his hands and said, "In that case, I thank the Daoist master!"</p><p>He still owed Qin Sang a debt of gratitude. Qin Sang using the *Seven Masters Buddha Seals* to comprehend the Sun Wheel Seal, and exchanging insights with them, would be beneficial to Jingtai Temple.</p><p>“The mysteries of the Sun Wheel Seal are profound. I wish to seek guidance on Buddhist principles from the esteemed monks of your temple.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow with a smile.</p><p>Mutual benefit is always preferable; discussing Buddhist principles would also be advantageous to him.</p><p>For a period in the Central State of the Storm World, he had studied Buddhist scriptures. Reflecting now, he realized that their tenets differed significantly from the Vajrayana tradition.</p><p>Different Buddhist schools represent different schools of thought.</p><p>Jingtai Temple, originating from the Vajrayana lineage, might offer him valuable insights.</p><p>As they exited the Vajra Stupa, the sunlight outside was bright.  Venerable Zhenru said, “I intend to close the temple and relocate to the mainland with my disciples. I will send word to you, Daoist Master, once we have chosen a settlement.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. “The Daoist courts haven't taken action yet. Is the situation truly that perilous?”</p><p>“Major wars always have premonitions. The Yao God Uprising was a clear sign; another great upheaval is inevitable. In the past, only the most skilled disciples were moved, preserving the temple's essence. But I sense this calamity will surpass all others. Our temple has no outside support and is in a precarious position.  Relocation is our only recourse,” Venerable Zhenru sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The Buddhist sect in this world was weak; this cautious approach was the reason Jingtai Temple had endured so long.</p><p>Returning to the temple, Qin Sang spent several days meditating and studying scriptures, gaining considerable understanding.</p><p>Soon, he took his leave of Venerable Zhenru and returned to Hu Zhong Island, where he received several Yinghua Pills from a messenger sent by Master Lingxu.</p><p>In return, Qin Sang selected a pill formula from the *Panhu True Scripture* for the messenger to deliver back.</p><p>With these matters concluded, Qin Sang didn't linger. After requesting his acquaintance to keep an eye out for rare materials and medicines, he promptly set off north. His journey was uneventful, and he returned to his Flower Field cave abode.</p><p>Back at his abode, Qin Sang began to study the Sun Wheel Seal, but recognized it would take significant time. He set it aside, prioritizing cultivation.</p><p>Having mastered the principles of his cultivation methods, and aided by his poison techniques and ascension tribulation lightning, it was time to focus on intense cultivation and break through to the mid-stage of the Divine Transformation Realm!</p><p>Summoning his Sky-Eyed Butterfly and feeding it an Yinghua Pill, Qin Sang mentally instructed it to protect him as he entered a meditative state, circulating his energy.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flowed by.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, over twenty years had passed.</p><p>Twenty years wasn't much for a Divine Transformation cultivator; mastering a single technique could take that long, and decades-long retreats were common.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang’s cultivation had made astonishing progress in just twenty years – a speed that was unimaginable to most.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang returned to Jushan several times, each visit brief.</p><p>After all, he had much to do.</p><p>He discussed swordsmanship with the True Person of the Sword, Buddhist principles with the Jingtai Temple monks, and the art of alchemy with Master Qi, constantly refining his armor-making techniques.</p><p>He also corresponded with Master Lingxu and Master Gu.</p><p>Furthermore, as promised, Qin Sang sought various rare herbs and sent them to the Yao Kingdom for Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Some were used for altar construction; others helped Mo Xingdao repair his puppet body and restore his cultivation.</p><p>The rest of his time was devoted to intense cultivation.</p><p>This smooth progress was something Qin Sang had never experienced. He could never have imagined achieving such rapid advancement at the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>He had never given up during previous hardships, and now, he would not slacken in the slightest.</p><p>…</p><p>This was the twenty-third year after the great war.</p><p>The cave abode remained tranquil.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, as if sensing something, flew around Qin Sang incessantly, the electric arcs on its wings casting flickering shadows within the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his breath barely perceptible, seeming asleep.</p><p>Gradually, the butterfly’s wingbeats slowed, until it transformed into a streak of light, merging into Qin Sang’s energy sea.</p><p>A long silence followed.</p><p>Then, after several days…</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A jade bottle shattered on the ground.  Flower dew floated to Qin Sang’s lips and was consumed.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang’s breathing intensified, causing a surge of spiritual energy within the cave and ripples in space.</p><p>The disturbance was visible, extending beyond the cave.</p><p>The mountain peak seemed shrouded in shadow.</p><p>This state lasted several hours.  Fortunately, protective formations were in place; otherwise, the mountain would have been leveled.</p><p>A rumbling sound echoed through the Flower Field space.</p><p>The disturbance grew, causing dark clouds to form above the cave, gathering relentlessly.</p><p>The clouds thickened, threatening to collapse the heavens.</p><p>Soon, muffled thunder emanated from the cave, the energy fluctuations intensified dramatically, and the world's energy began to rotate around the peak, forming a visible vortex.</p><p>The dark clouds descended.</p><p>A vortex of black clouds enveloped the peak, spinning faster and faster, causing mountains and earth to tremble.</p><p>A deafening roar, like the shattering of heaven and earth, exploded from the vortex's center.  Vast amounts of spiritual energy surged into the cave. Qin Sang’s body, like a bottomless pit, absorbed the energy voraciously.</p><p>He shuddered slightly, his cultivation technique running at full power.  With a final burst of effort, he assaulted the bottleneck!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The clouds dispersed. Qin Sang's aura transcended a limit, suddenly increasing before stabilizing.</p><p>Mid-Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>The spiritual energy slowly calmed, mirroring the tranquility that settled over Qin Sang's mind. He opened his eyes, a lingering surprise in their depths. In just seventy years, his physical body and true essence had both broken through—a cause for elation for anyone.</p><p>Even Qin Sang hadn't expected such rapid progress.  He clenched his fist, feeling the strength of his body and the vast, river-like flow of true essence within.</p><p>Based on past experience, Qin Sang had prepared for several failed attempts, gathering supporting pills and even considering waiting for his Sky-Eyed Butterfly companion to catch up before making another push.  The ascension tribulation and his understanding of the cultivation path had clearly yielded immense benefits, allowing him to succeed on his first attempt.</p><p>His surprise subsided, and Qin Sang mentally summoned his seven sword spirits.  They had indeed solidified somewhat; their enhanced power was evident even without testing. He sensed his Cloud-Roaming Sword within his spirit, a faint, joyful hum resonating, as if celebrating with him.  This was his life-bound spiritual sword, attuned to his will, signifying its growing sentience.  The birth of a spiritual fetus wouldn't be far off!</p><p>With good news piling up, Qin Sang, for all his mental fortitude, felt a moment of disbelief.  This realm was truly his blessed land!</p><p>As he calmed his thoughts, stabilized his cultivation, and continued to cultivate, he sighed.  Indeed, blessing and misfortune were intertwined. The remnants of the ascension tribulation were extremely weak, almost imperceptible, and would not be sustainable. Still, it had been enough to support his breakthrough to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, and Qin Sang was satisfied.</p><p>Having broken through both the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* and the *Spiritual Sword Nurturing Chapter*, his strength had leaped forward, but Qin Sang remained unsatisfied. There would be no second such cultivation paradise, and he would not waste time.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly flew from his dantian, dancing around him in joyful celebration of his breakthrough. Qin Sang awoke, raised a finger, and smiled as the butterfly landed on it. His breakthrough had been too rapid for it to keep pace, but with his essence blood and the Bright Flower Pill sustaining it, its breakthrough wouldn't be long in coming.</p><p>This short period had seen a complete enhancement.  While refining the Qilin primal seed, his divine sense had subtly strengthened, although somewhat restricted. The Fire Jade Centipede had also long since broken through to the late fourth transformation and was steadily progressing toward the peak.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the door and looked around the flower field.  He owed his achievements to the flower spirit and the *Poison God Scripture*. His gaze finally sharpened, focusing on the flower field aperture in the distant mountains.  He planned to investigate the aperture after his breakthrough, but he needed to prepare.</p><p>He decided to temporarily suspend cultivation, allowing the remaining flower essence to be absorbed by the poison pearl to enhance the power of the poison-dispelling glow, and to gather some defensive treasures.</p><p>“Once my cultivation is solidified, it's time to go home…” Qin Sang murmured, quickly gathering flower essence and returning to the cave.</p><p>A year later.</p><p>Qin Sang exited the flower field space and checked his markers, finding four damaged ones. While cultivating in the cave, he could only sense the nearby ones; focused on his breakthrough, he hadn't noticed anyone entering.  Markers had been damaged before, with people constantly entering and leaving the altar, but without causing the previous anomaly.  Whether it was experts sent by the Daoist Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom, or simply those exploring the altar, he didn't know.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang shook his head slightly, deciding to ignore it. Leaving the altar, he traveled north, deep into the Evil Plains. After hunting two ferocious beasts, experiencing the enhancement brought by his improved cultivation, he returned to Ju Mountain Altar.</p><p>He first visited the Demon Kingdom to see Mo Xingdao.</p><p>“It seems your cultivation will soon be restored,” Qin Sang observed, noting that Mo Xingdao had recovered to the peak of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Mo Xingdao sighed softly, shaking his head.  “I'm working to fully integrate with this puppet body.  The next stage is the greatest hurdle; whether I can recover to the Nascent Soul stage is uncertain.  I can't easily leave right now. Could you help me gather information on some rare spiritual materials? I…”</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted him. “If you encounter any difficulties in the future, please speak freely.  I, too, want to find the path to ascension.”</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded silently.</p>
