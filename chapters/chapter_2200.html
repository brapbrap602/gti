<h1>Chapter 2190:  Unfeeling and Impartial</h1><p>“What’s wrong with that?”</p><p>Ning Zhenren countered, “Self-cultivation, seeking only the transcendence of the Dao, without emotion or desire, without attachments—isn't that precisely the so-called path of the Lesser Vehicle?  Yet you people, claiming to follow the natural Dao and live freely, now also covet the path of the Greater Vehicle. Isn't that laughable?”</p><p>“It’s not about coveting the Greater Vehicle…”</p><p>The old Daoist looked helpless. “Even if we don’t want to admit it, the Greater Vehicle path is now flourishing, like a raging fire.  Forget the return of the Divine Court; the imperial court recently had a great debate on the Greater and Lesser Vehicles.  A hundred schools of thought—Confucianism, Legalism, military strategy, agriculture,  the School of Diplomacy, and so on—are all vying for influence.  Qianzhou has long implemented a merit system. In the Western lands, Buddhist monasteries have held countless scripture debates. Even among the demon tribes, it’s said that ancient practices are being revived.”</p><p>“So you also want to change course?” Ning Zhenren coldly snorted.</p><p>“Why do we cultivators cultivate? The Greater Vehicle path is becoming a major trend because the path to ascension is as difficult as ascending to heaven—desirable but unattainable.  Even our Grand Ancestor, throughout history, how many could match his talent?  The Jade Emperor, who led humanity to rise, drove out foreign tribes, founded the Great Zhou Dynasty, and ruled the myriad realms, ultimately failed.  And Sword Saint, seeking ascension, fell into the demonic path, his success or failure, life or death, remaining unknown. In comparison, if the Greater Vehicle path truly opens a path to immortality for all beings, why shouldn't we lend a hand?”</p><p>The old Daoist straightened, his demeanor changing abruptly, revealing the bearing of a true master.</p><p>Seeing his expression, Ning Zhenren also put away her casual air.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Ultimately, in front of his senior sister, the old Daoist’s composure didn't last long.  He changed his tone, “Later generations believe that the downfall of the Divine Court was 50% external and 50% internal, everyone harboring selfish desires. Unfeeling and impartial! If there truly is such a person in the world, who cultivates to the highest realm of the Greater Vehicle and protects the myriad beings, we hope that person is unfeeling.”</p><p>“Forgetfulness of self…”</p><p>Ning Zhenren muttered, her face suddenly frosty.  She said coldly, “I will never allow my disciple to become your puppet!”</p><p>“Senior Sister, why do you say that? Such a person cannot be seen as a puppet…”</p><p>The old Daoist gave a wry smile, sighing softly, “I’ll only say this in front of Senior Sister, but other Daoists probably have the same idea, though none dare speak it openly. The Grand Ancestor’s legacy is most likely related to the Greater Vehicle path!”</p><p>If they obtained the Grand Ancestor’s legacy, the Supreme Dao lineage could lead all races and sects in the Greater Vehicle path. Then, all branches would jointly support the inheritor in cultivating the path of supreme detachment.</p><p>“Deceivers cannot deceive themselves!”</p><p>Ning Zhenren shook her head slightly.</p><p>At this moment, the scene in the mirror suddenly changed, drawing their attention.</p><p>After the opening of the Otherkin sacred site, the magic mirror had been in chaos. Now the chaos seemed to be subsiding.</p><p>As if a layer of mist had been lifted, the mirror reflected a mysterious space—dark and profound, containing only one object: a white sundial. The material seemed to be ordinary white stone, ancient and weathered by countless years.</p><p>The Spring and Autumn Sundial!</p><p>Legend has it that the Spring and Autumn Sundial was the oldest and first treasure of the Dao Lord, perhaps later surpassed in fame and power by other Daoist treasures, but it was always his closest object.</p><p>Ning Zhenren and the old Daoist both gazed at the sundial, a subtle connection existing between the magic mirror and the sundial. If someone gained the sundial's recognition, all branches would know.</p><p>It was the Grand Ancestor's object, yet they could only glimpse it at this moment.  The sundial was in the Otherkin sacred site, and without the Great Dream Divine Monarch’s permission, even Greater Vehicle cultivators dared not trespass.</p><p>The Spring and Autumn Sundial waited quietly, awaiting its destined owner.</p><p>Then, the image in the mirror rapidly zoomed out, blurry, as if in a thick fog. Soon, some busy figures appeared, oblivious to the outside world.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The image suddenly shattered, returning to chaos.</p><p>The two knew that it must have been the Great Dream Divine Monarch or other powerful Otherkin who intervened, unwilling to let others observe their enlightenment.</p><p>In that short time, they had seen the disciples sent in by the Supreme Dao Sect, including Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>“This is Senior Sister’s new disciple? She… eh?”</p><p>The old Daoist froze, suddenly showing a surprised expression.  He was about to look closer, but the image had already shattered.</p><p>However, the old Daoist still noticed something unusual about Liu Li. Her expression didn't seem like that of someone who cultivated the emotionless path.</p><p>Master Ning gently plucked a string on her guqin, her gaze soft.  "Since her lover has returned, if their feelings are genuine, I will give them a chance."</p><p>*Zheng!*</p><p>The faint sound of the guqin rippled across the lake.</p><p>"Senior Sister..."</p><p>Seeing his senior sister's expression, the old Daoist sighed softly, remembering the past, his heart heavy.</p><p>...</p><p>Sacred Land, Heart Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed Hong Yue deeper into the mist.  Everyone was silent except Yuan Ren, who was beaming with excitement.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh...*</p><p>Soon, the sound of running water reached them.  They soon saw a vast lake and a small island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li exchanged a glance. This must be Heart Lake.</p><p>Being sent here to scout was also their opportunity. If the hidden realm hadn't been destroyed, they could seize the chance to obtain its treasures.</p><p>However, with the current changes in the Sacred Land, there were too many unknown factors in Heart Lake. They didn't have much confidence, especially with strong enemies lurking within.</p><p>The spiritual mist in Heart Lake hadn't dissipated yet, and the area ahead was shrouded in fog, obscuring the view. Even without the recent upheaval, based on past experience, Heart Lake was extremely dangerous at this time. The best time to enter would be after the spiritual mist dispersed.  But the two powerful cultivators in the Unity stage clearly wouldn't let them wait.</p><p>Following Hong Yue, the group landed on the island. Moments later, more figures arrived from the other side, flying through the mist and landing nearby.  These were cultivators sent by the Water Department.</p><p>Only the Water and Sky Departments sent people because during the beast tide, cultivators not affiliated with those two departments were forced to join them.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li immediately noticed the human cultivators.</p><p>"That swordsman is from Bi Chen Xuan…"</p><p>Liu Li transmitted a voice message privately.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the man, a tall, elegant young man with a gentleman's sword at his waist, dressed in a flowing blue robe. He was one of their competitors.</p><p>As Qin Sang looked, the young man noticed his gaze and nodded with a smile, clearly recognizing them.</p><p>Liu Li then introduced the others to Qin Sang. She didn't recognize one of them, likely not a Daoist cultivator, perhaps a random person or妖修 who had stumbled into the area.</p><p>There were four Daoist disciples present. But Qin Sang knew the Daoist sect sent more than that, and he didn't see the girl from Lang Xian Yuan in the red dress. She must have been eliminated.</p><p>These four weren't united; hailing from different sects, they would naturally be wary of each other.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang and Liu Li knew their chances of obtaining the innate spiritual treasure were slim. Their current goals were to absorb the spiritual energy of the immortal mountain and successfully overcome their tribulations.  The innate treasure was a bonus, so the number of opponents didn't significantly affect their mood.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang sensed another gaze on him. He frowned slightly, then turned, meeting the gaze calmly.</p><p>The person had a blue scaled fishtail and an exquisite face – the mermaid who had ambushed them outside the Great Perilous Nest when they first entered the Sacred Land.</p><p>Their brief encounter had been a draw, with Qin Sang and Shao Shi retreating.  They hadn't expected to run into her again.</p><p>Furthermore, like Hong Yue, the mermaid led the Water Department cultivators, suggesting her status might be similar to Hong Yue's—a close associate of another powerful cultivator at the Sacred Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly rejoiced at his earlier decision not to offend her too much, hoping she wouldn't seek revenge.  But he was still worried she might be capricious and unreasonable.</p><p>Fortunately, the mermaid merely gave him a teasing look before turning her gaze to Hong Yue, engaging in conversation.</p><p>After a while, Hong Yue turned to everyone, swiping his sleeve, and sending out jade slips to each of them.</p><p>"These are maps of Heart Lake. You should each have a copy, but maps are not entirely reliable. Many areas of Heart Lake have been drastically altered. Ancient formations and restrictions have changed. Relying solely on the maps will only get you killed!"</p><p>Hong Yue's warning confirmed Qin Sang and Liu Li's biggest fear. If the hidden realm had undergone major changes, Master Ning's preparations might be useless, leaving them to fend for themselves.</p><p>Their goal was Heart Lake, so naturally they had prepared maps.  Comparing them, the differences were minimal.  Hong Yue’s map had red lines radiating outwards from the island they were on.</p><p>"The red lines show the routes you need to explore. Choose one…" Hong Yue continued.</p><p>Qin Sang counted the red lines, finding the number of people was exactly double, his heart sinking slightly.  They might be separated from Yuan Ren!</p><p>Sure enough, Hong Yue then demanded everyone pair up. Yuan Ren didn't care who his partner was—perhaps he even preferred to be alone—and casually chose a member of the Imperial Clan.</p><p>Route selection was far from fair.  The members of the Outsider Clan chose first, leaving the outsiders until last.</p><p>For Qin Sang and Liuli, the ideal choice was the route closest to the Secret Realm, but Qin Sang selected a different one, farther away.</p><p>To prevent others from taking this route, he secretly contacted Yuan Ren, asking him to choose it first, then they would switch.</p><p>Yuan Ren readily agreed.  He’d accept any route and any danger along the way. As for his companion, they had no say and could only follow instructions.</p><p>Everyone quickly chose partners and routes.</p><p>Hong Yue produced some jade bracelets, distributing them. "Once inside the Heart Lake, if the bracelet glows, activate the enchantment within. Do nothing else…"</p><p>His expression darkened. He looked around, warning, "Don't try to avoid danger by circling outside.  Hong Tian has a way of knowing how far you've gone. And don't think that entering the Heart Lake means you can hide somewhere until the anomaly ends.  A strange force within the Heart Lake will gradually lull you to sleep if you stay too long, causing you to lose yourself, perhaps never to wake. Don't stay longer than ten days. Consider yourselves warned!"</p><p>Everyone was startled.</p><p>Many present harbored such thoughts.</p><p>Was Hong Yue telling the truth, or deceiving them? They couldn't verify it, but if a powerful cultivator wanted to control them, they wouldn’t use such a clumsy lie.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank. He wondered if the force that put people to sleep was the same problem the Outsider Clan ancestors faced. If even they were trapped, could the jade Buddha protect them?</p><p>This was a huge problem for Liuli.  If she were affected during her tribulation, it would be disastrous!</p><p>"I've said all I need to. I wish you all a safe return!"</p><p>Hong Yue gestured, signaling them to depart.</p><p>Moments later, two people took off, followed by the rest. Soon, only Hong Yue and the Mermaid remained. Hong Yue bowed to her, flew into the sky, then she left, leaving the island deserted.</p><p>Streams of light shot across the lake and through the mist, heading in different directions.</p><p>The mist stirred, then calmed.</p><p>Unnoticed by all, near the island, lake water gently lapped against the rocks.  As a wave crested, it seemed to open an eye, revealing a pale blue pupil.</p><p>A blue light flashed in the pupil, which subtly shifted, following the departing figures, finally fixing on one, the route chosen by Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The wave subsided, the eye closing, the pupil appearing and disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli remained vigilant, but sensed nothing unusual.  They flew across the open lake, surrounded only by drifting mist, seemingly peaceful, without any danger.</p><p>After flying for a while, Qin Sang estimated their distance, descending to the lake's surface.</p><p>Soon, a whooshing sound approached, Yuan Ren and another Outsider Clan member landing before them. The other cultivator wisely asked no questions.</p><p>Their bracelets and routes corresponded, requiring an exchange.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, Liuli Xianzi, take care. Until we meet again!"</p><p>Yuan Ren was eager to be gone.</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, ultimately not asking Yuan Ren to help kill the Celestial Child.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader made it clear the Zhuyan Clan could not participate in the hunt unless the Celestial Child provoked them first. Replacing Yuan Jian with Yuan Ren was the limit; Qin Sang couldn’t ask for more.</p><p>Besides, Yuan Ren, while naive, wasn’t stupid. If Qin Sang tried anything to involve him, Yuan Ren would notice.  He might even turn on them, making things worse. (End)</p>
