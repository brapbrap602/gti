<h1>Chapter 673: Douyan Island</h1><p>“Elder Zou, this is Daoist Qingfeng, whom I mentioned to you. Daoist Qingfeng, this is probably your first time meeting Elder Zou, correct?”</p><p>Ran Luo introduced the two.</p><p>“Indeed,” Qin Sang nodded, cupping his hands in greeting, “I am Qingfeng, it is a pleasure to meet you, Elder Zou.”</p><p>This person’s aura was subtle yet profound, indicating high cultivation. He appeared young, but was undoubtedly an ancient being.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang might have to work under him in the future, so he maintained a respectful attitude.</p><p>“Ran Luo has told me a lot about Daoist Qingfeng. I’ve been preoccupied with trivial matters and haven’t had the chance to greet you properly. Please forgive my negligence,” Elder Zou said amiably, appearing approachable.</p><p>This wasn't a suitable place for conversation. After exchanging greetings, they set off immediately, flying towards Mount Wushen.</p><p>Qin Sang then noticed the charming woman who had arrived with Ran Luo. She was very close to Elder Zou, but they didn't seem like Dao companions.</p><p>The woman's name was Yanwu, also a Core Formation early-stage cultivator, and surprisingly, a member of the Wu Tribe.</p><p>Several streaks of light soared into the sky, flashing like meteors as they sped towards Mount Wushen.</p><p>Before long, Mount Wushen came into view.</p><p>From afar, they could see numerous figures gathered at the foot of the mountain, all Wu Tribe members who had come to make a pilgrimage.</p><p>Mount Wushen was the recognized sacred mountain of the Wu Tribe. No one dared to occupy it alone, so there were no Wu Tribe sects on the mountain. It was jointly guarded by all Wu Tribe factions.</p><p>For this reason, the teleportation formation leading to the Demon Sea was located on Mount Wushen.</p><p>There were many ancient halls on the mountain, exuding an imposing aura. The teleportation formation was situated within one of them.</p><p>“We must land. Everyone is required to walk up Mount Wushen as a sign of respect, otherwise, it will provoke public anger.”</p><p>Elder Zou’s voice transmitted through sound transmission.</p><p>They could see that the cultivators who had arrived before them had also landed and were ascending the mountain via the stone steps.</p><p>In a foreign land, it was best to be cautious. Qin Sang immediately retracted his Ebony Sword and landed on a flat area at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Elder Zou, having the fastest flight speed, was waiting ahead. Seeing Qin Sang arrive, his eyes lit up. “Unexpectedly, Fellow Daoist is not only proficient in refining tools, but also possesses exceptional swordsmanship.  This remarkable sword technique alone makes you worthy of our full recruitment.  I sincerely invite you to consider joining our Qiongyu Trading Company. This is information about Douyan Island, my intended base in the Demon Sea.  Please take a look.”</p><p>Elder Zou handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>“In front of Elder Zou, my meager skill is hardly worth mentioning. I am merely showing off,” Qin Sang said modestly, feeling a little embarrassed. With his natal flying sword, his swordsmanship indeed looked impressive, but if he used another flying sword, his true skill would be revealed.</p><p>The contents of the jade slip were very detailed, including the identity of the island lord, which was not concealed from Qin Sang.</p><p>Douyan Island was a large island located between Dahuang Island and Tianwu Island, occupying a strategic position along the sea route. The island lord was a renowned Nascent Soul Grand Patriarch named Lin Hai.</p><p>Before Lin Hai took control, Douyan Island didn’t hold such importance. After cultivators occupied it, they were repeatedly besieged by demonic beasts. Countless cultivators perished, with only a few lucky survivors.</p><p>This was related to Douyan Island's location.</p><p>It was the outermost major island along the route, making it difficult for reinforcements to arrive in time. Furthermore, there was a bottomless trench near Douyan Island, teeming with demonic beasts.</p><p>Excessive hunting of demonic beasts in this area could easily enrage them, leading to an unstoppable beast tide.</p><p>After Lin Hai occupied Douyan Island, his presence as a Nascent Soul Grand Patriarch acted as a stabilizing force.</p><p>At the same time, Lin Hai established many rules, such as forbidding cultivators from hunting in large groups, limiting them to small teams, and prohibiting widespread slaughter.</p><p>Since then, Douyan Island had become very safe.  Remarkably, there hadn’t been a single demonic beast attack on the island.</p><p>Over the years, with changes to the sea route and Lin Hai's diligent management, Douyan Island had achieved its current status.</p><p>Gaining a foothold on such a significant island wasn’t easy.  Elder Zou and the Qiongyu Trading Company had invested significant effort.</p><p>The jade slip contained not only information on Douyan Island, but also brief introductions to other well-known islands in the Demon Sea.</p><p>After reviewing everything, Qin Sang found Douyan Island to be an excellent choice.</p><p>He excelled in escape techniques and could always escape danger in time, so having fewer teammates wouldn’t be a problem. Moreover, his primary goal wasn’t hunting demonic beasts but comprehending the Killing Talisman, which required sufficiently powerful opponents. He wouldn't actively engage in slaughter.</p><p>In comparison, other islands had their own rules, some even stricter than Douyan Island’s, resembling the regulations of cultivation sects.</p><p>Of course, there were options for those who didn't want to be restricted.</p><p>They could go to smaller islands, or even occupy an island and become its lord, living a carefree life. The vast Demon Sea was dotted with countless islands of various sizes, offering a wide selection.</p><p>However, these places lacked safety and were constantly threatened.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the contents of the jade slip, without giving Elder Zou an immediate answer.</p><p>Unconsciously, they had ascended Mount Wushen.  Elder Zou seemed very familiar with the place, leading them through the halls until they reached a grand hall called the Tianwu Hall.</p><p>An elderly Wu tribesman happened to be exiting the hall.  Seeing them, he sneered, “Old Ghost Zou, you’re back? You’ve withdrawn so many Core Formation cultivators again, Pingbo Harbor must be almost empty. Aren’t you afraid of someone taking advantage of the situation and destroying the foundation humans have built over the years?”</p><p>Elder Zou snorted coldly, “You old thing have the nerve to talk. If it weren’t for your Wu Tribe's treachery, we wouldn't be in this situation. Compared to our lives, what’s Pingbo Harbor?”</p><p>The elder chuckled, “You humans are deceitful, always projecting your own thoughts onto others...”</p><p>He didn’t say anything more. After collecting spirit stones, he handed each of them a command-arrow-shaped talisman before allowing them to enter.</p><p>“This talisman is a Teleportation Talisman. It can withstand the spatial pressure during teleportation. The teleportation formation to the Demon Sea is a modified ancient formation, prone to instability. Sometimes, spatial turbulence can occur.  Under normal circumstances, we Core Formation cultivators can withstand the spatial pressure with our full strength. However, if turbulence occurs, we must rely on this talisman for protection to pass through safely.  Just in case, everyone should activate the power of the Teleportation Talisman before teleporting...” Ran Luo softly explained the usage of the Teleportation Talisman to Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished.</p><p>The Small Cold Realm could only use existing ancient teleportation formations or barely repair those with minor damage. He had never heard of any sect capable of modifying an ancient teleportation formation.</p><p>However, modifying an ancient teleportation formation must require extremely demanding conditions, otherwise, the Canglang Sea would be filled with teleportation formations.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the teleportation formation, recalling the scene of his teleportation from the Ziwei Palace. If he had had such a Teleportation Talisman back then, he might not have needed to sever his arm to survive.</p>
