<h1>Chapter 2256: Azure Sky, Green Void</h1><p>The mysterious Azure Qilin remained silent, unable to answer Qin Sang's questions.</p><p>No one knew the extent of the Outer Demons' infiltration into this world.</p><p>Qin Sang was the only one who had heard its call and could communicate directly with it.  Encountering the demons' minions could jeopardize their remaining hope.</p><p>Worse still, even his allies might not be trustworthy. The Outer Demons' abilities were too bizarre; some allies might already be corrupted and turn against them at a crucial moment.</p><p>"Also, can those demonic shadows be trusted? What if they encounter the true demon lord, are defeated, and then controlled? Or what if the demon lord is disguised as one of them?"</p><p>Qin Sang continued.</p><p>He racked his brain, searching for reasons to dissuade the mysterious Azure Qilin.</p><p>In fact, his concerns weren't unfounded; such scenarios were entirely possible.  Even if the probability was low, they couldn't gamble on it; a single mistake couldn't be afforded!</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky and sighed, his voice filled with grief and anger, "Heaven is blind! Am I destined to walk this path alone? Is there no one in this world whom I can completely trust?"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Qilin remained silent.</p><p>Seeing the Azure Qilin's continued silence, Qin Sang asked, "Senior, what exactly is that treasure, and when will it appear?"</p><p>"...Developing… previously… unknown…"</p><p>The Azure Qilin sighed.</p><p>"Driving out the Outer Demons and protecting the treasure is my sworn duty."</p><p>Qin Sang declared righteously, then his tone shifted.  "But I am alone and weak. Senior, is there any way you can help me improve my strength quickly?"</p><p>"You?"</p><p>The Azure Qilin wasn't questioning Qin Sang's ability; it had no other choice.</p><p>Qin Sang taking on the world alone sounded heroic, but the hope was slim!</p><p>"Senior, you've been holding off the Outer Demons. Among the remaining beings in this world, the strongest are at the peak of the Dharma Realm. I need at least that level of strength to have a chance."</p><p>The peak of the Dharma Realm was equivalent to the peak of the Void Refinement stage. Qin Sang's current cultivation was far from that level, but his expression was serious, showing his determination to be a lone hero.</p><p>"I believe I have considerable talent!  Senior, after I grasped the Dharma Image and heard your voice, my cultivation speed has increased significantly.  Since the treasure won't appear immediately, with your help, Senior, it might be achievable!"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was full of confidence.</p><p>It turned out that things weren't as Qin Sang had initially feared.</p><p>The Azure Qilin had been unaware of his existence.  Since it hadn't actively chosen him, Qin Sang could focus on cultivation without worry.</p><p>Of course, this information could be fabricated by the Azure Qilin to deceive him, but the likelihood was low, given evidence from outside the illusion, suggesting its words were true.</p><p>Based on past experience, if Qin Sang continued cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, he could immediately break through to the fifth layer, and then quickly reach the sixth, reaching the equivalent of the early Void Refinement stage in the real world.</p><p>Whether he could maintain this cultivation speed beyond that stage was uncertain.</p><p>However, he couldn't openly cultivate at this rate; it was unnatural and would arouse suspicion from the Azure Qilin.</p><p>To maintain the pretense, Qin Sang would control his cultivation speed and use other methods to mask it, such as pills.</p><p>Or he could ask the Azure Qilin for some fortuitous encounters!</p><p>The Azure Qilin remained silent for a moment, seemingly persuaded, and said, "Go… to Azure Sky, Green Void!"</p><p>"Where is Azure Sky, Green Void? Senior? Senior?"</p><p>Qin Sang called out repeatedly, but received no response.</p><p>It seemed the Azure Qilin was once again engaged by its opponent, though its situation seemed better than before; at least, there were no screams.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped calling and fell into contemplation.  Could the Azure Sky, Green Void be a secret realm of the Azure Qilin clan?</p><p>It must be a treasure land. Even without needing external help, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel curious and want to visit.  Perhaps there were significant fortuitous encounters within.</p><p>The problem was how to enter Azure Sky, Green Void without alarming the Azure Qilin clan's strong cultivators.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't need to worry about that; since the Azure Qilin told him to go, there must be a way.</p><p>Unknowingly, dawn gradually broke. Qin Sang hadn't left the valley and waited in place.</p><p>Tianqi's identity is best kept; he needs a plausible reason to leave the front lines to go to Qingshao Bixu.</p><p>After three days of waiting, he finally heard the mysterious Qingluan's voice again.</p><p>...</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Qin Sang boarded the spirit boat.  This boat had just delivered the new commander and was returning to the main camp.  </p><p>On board, Qin Sang considered his next move.</p><p>Qingshao Bixu is indeed an important sacred site of the Qingluan clan, second only to their most sacred place, located within their territory.</p><p>Qin Sang had already investigated: the Qingluan territory is located in the far west among all the Feng clan territories, roughly northeast of Lingkong Mountain, directly east of Qin Sang's current location.  He could fly there directly if he took the time. But entering Qingshao Bixu undetected would be difficult; such an important site would undoubtedly be heavily guarded by the clan's elite.</p><p>As they neared the camp, Qin Sang stopped the spirit boat and left alone.</p><p>Qin Sang flew to the rear of the demon army, preparing to find an opportunity to break through the fifth level of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique.</p><p>Once he reaches the Divine Transformation stage, his strength and escape techniques will undergo a qualitative change.</p><p>However, this will bring him a human tribulation. He must pass it while the mysterious Qingluan is dormant, and he must also confirm one thing beforehand.</p><p>“Senior, are you awake? I am currently on my way to Qingshao Bixu…”</p><p>During this period, the mysterious Qingluan's communications were short, followed by long periods of silence. Their exchanges were intermittent.</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan hummed in response.</p><p>“Junior has been wandering among the minor branches since childhood, unrecognized by the clan. I’m worried that if my attempt to infiltrate Qingshao Bixu, using the method you taught, is discovered, it will lead to my death,” Qin Sang worried. “I dare ask for your help in concealing my presence!”</p><p>“The enemy… is strong! They… trapped me in the Demon Realm… I cannot breathe, how… can I help you?”</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan's voice was filled with exhaustion.</p><p>Qin Sang persisted, “With your immense power, you cannot escape? Could you transfer some of your power to help me protect myself?”</p><p>“I… see… only darkness,” the Qingluan sighed, filled with helplessness.</p><p>Its previous claim of holding back the extra-dimensional demon was the opposite of the truth.  It and other powerful demons were unexpectedly pulled into the battlefield.  Its situation is now precarious; it can only defend.</p><p>This is why it was not optimistic about Qin Sang's chances; besides guiding him towards opportunities, it could offer little help.</p><p>So it couldn't see him!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.  He asked doubtfully, “If that’s the case, why can I hear your call?”</p><p>“I… also do not know…”</p><p>According to the mysterious Qingluan, it was trapped in a Demon Realm created by the enemy, unable to escape and unaware of its allies' situations.</p><p>With no allies coming to its rescue, it didn't want to wait for death. The only thing it could do was to use every means to reveal the truth.</p><p>Upon breaking through to the  "Spirit Star" stage, he had learned a technique called "Luan Star Illumination".</p><p>Among the demons, the quality of the manifested forms varies widely, with each race having different standards.</p><p>Of course, every demon who breaks through to the Manifestation stage and comprehends a manifested form is a top talent of its clan.  The form doesn't represent everything; there are many variables in the future, but it's undeniable that the more perfect, the closer to the peak quality, the greater the potential, and the more the clan will value it.</p><p>Wherever the Luan Star light shines, if a descendant of the same clan comprehends a manifested form, and especially a peak-quality one, the mysterious Qingluan would sense it.  If it determined the individual to be truly gifted, it could directly guide and bestow opportunities.</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan intended to use this "Luan Star Illumination" to summon strong Qingluan clan members it had previously sensed.  Unexpectedly, the call wasn't answered by any of them, but by Qin Sang, who hadn't even reached the Manifestation stage.</p><p>It could only attribute this to Qin Sang's bloodline and talent;  at Qin Sang's level, being able to grasp a manifested form's phantom is exceptionally rare even among the Qingluan.</p><p>Learning the truth, Qin Sang reflected.  In the real world, his Qingluan manifested form’s origin is deeply connected to the remnant soul of a powerful Qingluan, so its quality must be high.</p><p>Could the real world be influencing this?</p><p>However, initially, he could hear the mysterious Qingluan's call even before he had a manifested form phantom.</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled and could only set this question aside for now.</p><p>He felt a mixture of hope and anxiety.</p><p>The good news was that the mysterious Azure Qilin was firmly engaged by its enemies, eliminating the immediate threat of its arrival.  He could now focus on his cultivation without worry.</p><p>The bad news was that the Azure Qilin was trapped within its enemies' magical domain, unable to intervene in the world. How could he possibly get it to help him find the person he was searching for?</p><p>"Since I can hear your voice, Senior, it means your power affects me. Does this imply a connection has been established between us, a bridge, unseen by your enemies? Could you refine this ability to transmit other things across this bridge, like your powers or spells?" Qin Sang offered a hypothesis.</p><p>If he could harness the power of a powerful yao (demon) creature, all his problems would be solved. He was determined to try.</p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p>The mysterious Azure Qilin fell silent, lost in thought.</p><p>Qin Sang's guess seemed plausible, but currently impossible.</p><p>"I...need to...think. Your cultivation...is too weak!" the Azure Qilin stated bluntly.</p><p>"I will diligently cultivate!" Qin Sang immediately pledged.</p><p>Following the established pattern, the stronger his cultivation, the deeper his connection with the Azure Qilin.</p><p>"Thanks to your guidance, Senior, I've had some insights and believe I'll soon be ready to attempt a breakthrough," Qin Sang expressed his aspirations.</p><p>"Breakthrough? Your...talent is truly...remarkable!"</p><p>The Azure Qilin's tone held a hint of surprise.  It knew their interactions had been limited, providing little direct guidance.  Qin Sang's rapid approach to a breakthrough could only mean exceptional talent.</p><p>Perhaps he could truly achieve his goals!</p><p>Their conversation continued for a while longer, when suddenly the Azure Qilin roared, "No! He...is attacking...you...at Qingxiao Bixu...wait for me..."</p><p>Then, silence.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the stars, having finally ascertained the Azure Qilin's true predicament through careful probing.</p><p>For now, the Azure Qilin wasn't a threat, but rather a powerful ally.</p><p>He departed, flying for several days until he found a secluded area.  He entered a meditative state, clearing his mind and silently cultivating the *Tianyao Lianxing* technique.</p><p>He was already at the threshold of a breakthrough; it would be relatively easy.</p><p>Being in the heart of yao territory, Qin Sang was cautious. He set up numerous formations to mask the celestial phenomena of his ascension before attempting his breakthrough.</p><p>In an instant, the spiritual energy surged, and wind and thunder raged.</p><p>He again experienced the process of reaching the Divine Transformation stage,  but this time, *Tianyao Lianxing*, his primary cultivation technique, took the lead instead of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*.</p><p>Infernal fire, demonic wind, heavenly thunder...</p><p>The tribulation struck in waves, but Qin Sang showed no fear, even counterattacking with apparent ease.</p><p>Finally, he shattered the last heavenly tribulation with a powerful blow, the celestial phenomena dissipated, and the dark clouds dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly summoned his Azure Qilin avatar.  The avatar, reforged after his breakthrough, appeared significantly more substantial than before.  He’d spent a considerable time perfecting it in the past.</p><p>"I was afraid you'd suddenly come back to life!"</p><p>He murmured, gazing at the familiar yet unfamiliar avatar.  Was this transformation due to the Azure Qilin's  "Universal Radiance" ability, or something else entirely?</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang erased all traces of his presence and, with a flap of his phoenix wings, shot into the sky like lightning.</p><p>Using lightning escape techniques, his speed was breathtaking.  His rapid flight was impossible to conceal.  He frequently encountered other yao cultivators, who, sensing his pure Azure Qilin aura, fled in fear.</p><p>He progressed unimpeded until nearing Azure Qilin territory, at which point he slowed, descending to the ground and proceeding calmly.</p><p>Before him stretched a vast, verdant forest. Beautiful birds frolicked and soared in the sky, a scene of serenity and peace.  These were not pure-blooded phoenixes.  There were no common phoenixes; all were inherently powerful, favored by Heaven, explaining their status as divine beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang moved even more discreetly through the undergrowth. The Azure Qilin’s territory was immense. After traveling an unknown distance, he finally reached the location.</p><p>Qingxiao Bixu lay ahead.</p>
