<h1></h1><p>"He wounded you with love, despite your world-shaking talent, the endowment of the heavens, yet you've wasted so many years in anguish. You endured the pain of sealing away your emotions, painstakingly cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light. But he didn't appear sooner, didn't appear later, choosing precisely the pivotal moment when your Profound Art was near completion to disrupt your Dao Heart; his heart deserves to be punished!"</p><p>Shi Xue was filled with righteous indignation, denouncing the unfaithful one.</p><p>Especially since that fellow, upon seeing her junior sister, even dared to act fiercely, attacking her. He was simply an ungrateful and heartless wretch, betraying her junior sister's devoted affection.</p><p>Liuli's gaze was somewhat peculiar. After Shi Xue finished her tirade, she softly said, "I need to go out for a while."</p><p>Shi Xue sniffled, gave her junior sister a deep look, and frowned, "That man is so heartless, and you still want to see him? Why not just let the Grand Elder and Old Devil Hunmo kill him and be done with this karmic entanglement!"</p><p>Liuli was silent.</p><p>They stared at each other for a moment.</p><p>Shi Xue knew her junior sister's temperament was stubborn. Once she made a decision, no amount of eloquent persuasion would work. Reluctantly, she waved her hand, "Go, go!"</p><p>She sat on the prayer mat, huffing and puffing, looking utterly disappointed but also helpless.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Liuli rose, her jade hand gently pointed, leaving behind an ice sculpture in her place. She walked to the door, paused slightly, and said, "I will persuade him to return the Sacred Artifact."</p><p>As she spoke, Liuli's figure turned illusory and vanished without a sound.</p><p>A long, drawn-out sigh echoed in the silent room.</p><p>...</p><p>On the island reef.</p><p>Qin Sang busied himself for quite a while, setting up another formation.</p><p>Then, he flew eastward for a time, searching all around. Soon, he found the place Chen Yan had mentioned.</p><p>There were seven small islands here, arranged like the Seven Stars in a row, not difficult to find. The largest was only a thousand *zhang* across , and the smallest resembled a large rock.</p><p>Qin Sang, surveying from above, examined the area, then landed on the largest island.</p><p>The island was uninhabited and possessed beautiful, refined scenery.</p><p>He casually sat cross-legged beneath an ancient tree and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>He didn't know how much time had passed.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt something, his eyes snapped open, and he looked towards the east.</p><p>The bright moon shone down.</p><p>Under the moonlight, a figure in plain white gracefully arrived, like a celestial maiden treading on water, none other than Chen Yan. She came alone, with no other figures beside her.</p><p>Qin Sang's Divine Sense had greatly improved, coupled with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's supernatural power, making it difficult for any disguise to deceive him.</p><p>He looked at this familiar yet unfamiliar figure, his eyes somewhat complex. He rose, straightened his clothes, released his own aura, and walked out of the forest.</p><p>A gentle breeze swept past.</p><p>Liuli lowered her escape light, lightly stepped onto the shore, her clear, cold eyes turned, and landed on Qin Sang's face, which was without a mask.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly met her gaze, sizing up the only woman in his life with whom he had shared intimate contact. The long years had not left the slightest mark on her exquisite beauty, as stunning as when they first met.</p><p>However, at that time, his emotion had mostly been fear and trepidation.</p><p>Even though they had only met twice, Qin Sang could tell that her changes were obvious, her aura even colder than before, like an iceberg.</p><p>After a long silence.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind her and spoke first, breaking the silence, "I didn't expect you to come alone."</p><p>"There is no enmity between us."</p><p>Liuli said in a calm tone.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and sighed, "Yes, it was fortunate that the Immortal saved me back then, shattering Dongyang Bo's conspiracy, allowing me to escape from his clutches. Chen Yan is probably an assumed name, right?"</p><p>"You created the opportunity, I took the shot in retaliation, it was for my own sake."</p><p>Liuli said seriously, not taking credit.</p><p>She didn't ask how Qin Sang had left back then, or where he had been hiding all those years. After a pause, she said, "Chen Yan is my secular name. My master took me in and named me Liuli."</p><p>"Liuli..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at her eyes, indeed as clear as *liuli* , at a loss for what to say for a moment. He took out the mysterious ice box, coughed lightly, and smiled, "The Immortal gifted the Ice Pearl to me. Are you not afraid that I will comprehend a method to bypass the seal and pocket this treasure?"</p><p>Chen Yan didn't seem to understand the jest in Qin Sang's words and answered seriously as before, "My cultivation method is unique; others cannot replicate it. If I didn't help you isolate the seal, you would be suspicious."</p><p>*I know, of course, the reason why you did this. There is no need to be so rigid.*</p><p>*Moreover, answering only when asked is bothersome when communicating with this kind of ice-cold beauty.*</p><p>*I wonder if her nature was originally like this or if it was caused by these changes and tribulations.*</p><p>Qin Sang grumbled inwardly, thinking of the past. He and Liuli could be considered to be in the same boat. He sighed inwardly, gathered his thoughts, and said seriously, "The Immortal wants to persuade me to return this item?"</p><p>Seeing Liuli nod, Qin Sang curiously asked, "How are you going to persuade me? What can I get?"</p><p>"I can help you with a fair trade."</p><p>Liuli's gaze fell on the ice box.</p><p>Fair trade.</p><p>Qin Sang believed she definitely understood that fairness was relative. He thought for a moment and asked, "You mean, you will tell me its origin and value, as well as the bottom line that Xuantian Palace can accept."</p><p>Liuli nodded lightly. Without waiting for Qin Sang to inquire further, she took the initiative to explain, "This is a Sacred Artifact of Xuantian Palace."</p><p>Sacred Artifact!</p><p>Qin Sang was solemn. No wonder Xuantian Palace had mobilized so many people.</p><p>As the founder of a sect, Qin Sang knew very well that what a sect revered as a Sacred Artifact was not necessarily a unique treasure in the world, but it was definitely extremely important to the sect, even concerning the rise and fall of the sect in serious cases.</p><p>Once a Sacred Artifact was lost, they would inevitably try to retrieve it at all costs.</p><p>If the seal were not difficult to solve and there was a buffer to play with, Xuantian Palace would probably be crazy and set off a great storm.</p><p>"What is sealed inside, and what is its function?"</p><p>Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>He thought Liuli would hold back somewhat.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Liuli didn't conceal anything or show any difficulty, "The Sacred Artifact is the key to open the Sacred Land."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, as expected, "Is the Sacred Land some kind of secret realm or some other place?"</p><p>Liuli shook her head. To explain clearly, she added a few more words, "The internal environment of the Sacred Land is unique, it has a special boost to some cultivation methods, but I have never been inside. The Sacred Land should have been opened recently, but an accident led to the theft of the Sacred Artifact."</p><p>She seemed to have not spoken so many words at once for a long time, and her pronunciation was a little slow.</p><p>Qin Sang listened carefully and fell into thought. The accident Liuli mentioned should refer to Ghost Mother infiltrating Xuantian Palace.</p><p>Could Ghost Mother's intention be related to the Sacred Land?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more likely it seemed. If she only wanted the sea chart, she could directly come to the door, there was no need to infiltrate with such pains, causing a riot in Xuantian Palace.</p><p>Thinking of this, he didn't directly ask, deciding to probe indirectly.</p><p>"Do most people in Xuantian Palace cultivate the way of ice and cold?" Qin Sang asked. If it was only effective for cultivators who cultivated this kind of cultivation method, the Xuantian Palace Sacred Land would be of little use to him.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Liuli returned to her taciturn state, confirming this.</p><p>"Since it is a key, why did that person not hesitate to betray Xuantian Palace and steal the Sacred Artifact? Could it be that he wants to monopolize the Sacred Land?" Qin Sang noticed the strangeness of the situation.</p><p>The Sacred Artifact definitely had more than just this one function.</p><p>"The entrance to the Sacred Land is a forbidden area, outsiders cannot enter."</p><p>Liuli first dispelled Qin Sang's idea of ​​sneaking into the Sacred Land himself, and then said, "It is a Crystal of the Ice Demon."</p><p>"Crystal of the Ice Demon?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, lowered his head and pondered, none of the ancient books he had seen before had any records related to this treasure.</p><p>"The crystalline core left behind after the fall of an Ice Demon."</p><p>Speaking, Liuli paused slightly, seeing Qin Sang's confusion, "Ice Demons are unique demon spirits born from heaven and earth. Cultivators who switch to the Ice Demon Body and refine the Crystal of the Ice Demon have a chance to complete the Ice Demon Body and advance to the Late Nascent Soul stage."</p><p>Hearing the words 'Ice Demon Body', Qin Sang immediately thought of the strange spiritual body of that man in white.</p><p>No wonder that person did not hesitate to betray his master and steal the Sacred Artifact.</p><p>In the present-day cultivation world, the Late Nascent Soul stage was the pinnacle of existence, and this temptation was great enough.</p><p>After pondering, Qin Sang asked, "Is the Ice Demon Body a secret technique dedicated to cultivating the primordial spirit?"</p><p>Liuli wasn't surprised that Qin Sang knew this, because the traitor was most likely killed by him. She corrected, "It is not a secret technique, it is a Spirit Cultivation method. The primordial spirit transforms into an Ice Demon, existing in the world as a spirit body.</p><p>"</p><p>It really is that kind of cultivation method!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he hurriedly asked about the details.</p><p>Liuli spoke a little more fluently than before, "After cultivating the Ice Demon Body, the primordial spirit draws on the essence of the physical body, transforming the body into an Ice Demon spirit body. The physical body is a container, which can be refined into something similar to a *benming*  magic treasure or a puppet. This method has flaws, only the Nascent Soul part of it remains, and cultivators of the Ice and Cold Path can forcefully modify the cultivation, and it is extremely dangerous, easy to lose control, nine deaths and one life. One should not rashly refine it unless there is no other way out."</p><p>She seemed to be explaining, but also warning.</p><p>Qin Sang was not worried about losing control.</p><p>But giving up the physical body and existing as a spirit body was difficult for him to accept. All of his accumulation over the years, his cultivation, the physical body that he had painstakingly tempered with Stellar Essence, all needed to be abandoned.</p><p>Based on his experience, now, the simultaneous cultivation of three paths was the right way. The Ice Demon Body was a pure Spirit Cultivation, even more extreme than the present-day Law Cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, only refining the Crystal of the Ice Demon would allow one to advance to the Late Stage, which really had no appeal to him.</p><p>He had plenty of time to prepare to break through to the Late Nascent Soul Stage.</p><p>If it were the opportunity to transform into Spirit Divinity, he might hesitate a little.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed this thought, continuing to ask, "Does the Crystal of the Ice Demon only have this one function?"</p><p>Liuli became more and more fluent, candidly saying, "The Crystal of the Ice Demon is related to the Sacred Land, and few people in Xuantian Palace know about it. I once heard my master say that it is stored in the Frozen Spring in the forbidden area, absorbing the power of the cold spring, its spirituality being worn away, becoming equivalent to a dead object. It has three functions. One is that it can be cultivated into an Ice Demon Body, the second is that it can be fused by a Ghost King. If it withstands the impact, it can be directly transformed into an Ice Demon, and the third is that it can be cultivated and refined by fellow demon practitioners, strengthening their bloodline."</p><p>At the end, she added, "These are just guesses and have not been verified."</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>The ghost spirit controlled by Old Devil Hunmo was undoubtedly of Ghost King level. The Crystal of the Ice Demon was of no small attraction to him, which was why Xuantian Palace was wary of Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>At least for now, there was no need to worry about Xuantian Palace and Old Devil Hunmo joining hands to retrieve the Sacred Artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang thought about these things, looked down at the ice box in his hand, and thoughtfully said, "In that case, unless I want to switch to cultivating the Ice Demon Body, or have a Ghost King servant. To me, this Sacred Artifact is useless."</p><p>He didn't completely believe Liuli's words, but after analyzing the conversation just now, he didn't see any loopholes.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dig to the bottom, because he believed that Liuli must have some intentions in doing this. If she was deceiving herself about something, she would definitely reveal a flaw.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Liuli emphasized, "You are very dangerous!"</p><p>Does she mean that it is dangerous for me to occupy the Crystal of the Ice Demon?</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head and looked at Liuli's eyes. Her eyes were still clear and peaceful, unable to peek into her thoughts, what she was really thinking.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qin Sang laughed and said lightly, "I heard that the state of the Palace Master of Xuantian Palace is not good, and he cannot easily make a move. Besides him, how many others can threaten me?"</p><p>A trace of fluctuation appeared in Liuli's eyes, surprised that Qin Sang knew so much about the Palace Master of Xuantian Palace.</p><p>"This is not difficult to guess, Xuantian Palace lost the Sacred Artifact, but the Palace Master doesn't show up. Either it is inconvenient to make a move, or there is something more important. What is more important than the Sacred Land? Or are you planning to join hands with Old Devil Hunmo?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mention that he knew Ghost Mother had rioted in Xuantian Palace.</p><p>He didn't know what Ghost Mother did in Xuantian Palace. In case the Palace Master of Xuantian Palace was injured by her, or she stole some important treasure, and Xuantian Palace couldn't find the main culprit, blaming it on him would be a great injustice.</p><p>Liuli nodded almost imperceptibly, acknowledging Qin Sang's statement, and said after a moment of silence, "Not for now."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly, as he had expected before, Xuantian Palace must want to seek a trade with him at the beginning, and would not risk cooperating with Old Devil Hunmo unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"Not the Palace Master and Old Devil Hunmo, then who?" Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>"The Grand Elder."</p><p>Liuli added an explanation, "Before the Wanmo Assembly, the Grand Elder received news that the traitor had fought fiercely with a demon king, and the Sacred Artifact may have fallen into the hands of the demon race, so he went to the demon realm alone."</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned when he heard this, immediately guessed the source of this news, and couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>It must be Teacher Feng, unwilling to work in vain, thinking that the treasure had fallen into the hands of the demon king, deliberately spreading this news to attract Xuantian Palace to find Bifang's trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard Teacher Feng and the others discuss the matter, borrowing a knife to kill, and not wanting to cause trouble to themselves, causing the situation near Fengyang Mountain to be in chaos, so they didn't publicize it, and it only recently reached Xuantian Palace's ears.</p><p>I wonder if the Grand Elder found Bifang?</p><p>If Bifang knew the inside story, he would definitely be so angry that smoke would come out of his orifices.</p><p>Qin Sang thought that Bifang was hiding in the cave, and disaster fell from the sky. He was immediately gloating and laughed in his heart for a while, "Is the Grand Elder also a Great Cultivator?"</p><p>He once again marveled at the depth of Xuantian Palace's foundation.</p><p>On the surface, there was the Palace Master who shook the world, and secretly there was also a Grand Elder sitting in charge. If Ghost Mother hadn't stirred up the situation, even if that traitor had planned it for a long time, he would not have had the opportunity to steal the Sacred Artifact.</p><p>His heart stirred. Could the Grand Elder be her master?</p><p>Attracted by the topic of the Sacred Artifact, Qin Sang had always forgotten to ask her how she finally dealt with her grievances with Dongyang Bo, and whether she had rescued her master.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Liuli's answer was somewhat unexpected. Without waiting for Qin Sang to ask, she continued, "The Grand Elder has already cultivated to the peak of the Mid Nascent Soul stage, with Divine Sense manifested into form, no weaker than you. She once suffered from cultivation deviation, which laid the roots of disaster, leading to the failure of her impact on the Late Nascent Soul stage. Only then has she been trapped by the bottleneck."</p><p>Half a foot into the Late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Divine Sense manifested into form.</p><p>A figure appeared in Qin Sang's mind, Old Devil Mu of Canglang Sea!</p><p>Excluding Old Devil Ye, who was able to advance and suppressed his cultivation with a clone, and his elusive senior sister, Old Devil Mu was the first person Qin Sang had seen below the Great Cultivators.</p><p>With the support of Xuantian Palace behind her, the Grand Elder's strength might be even stronger than Old Devil Mu.</p><p>At this time.</p><p>Liuli's tone paused for a moment, and she solemnly said, "The Grand Elder possesses a Spiritual Treasure!"</p>
