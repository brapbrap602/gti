<h1>Chapter 895: Infiltration</h1><p>Chapter 895: Infiltration</p><p>Leaving the shadows, the young man surnamed Fang brought out a magical item, the Crimson Yuan Shawl.  Activating it, it transformed into a silken garment that enveloped him, altering his appearance and aura. He instantly became a different young man.</p><p>The arrogant expression on his face quickly vanished. He suppressed his cultivation to the early stage of the Core Formation realm, his demeanor undergoing a complete transformation, making him inconspicuous.</p><p>“Please, Brother Hong and Brother Gao, lead the way.”</p><p>Fang bowed slightly and spoke softly.</p><p>At that moment, two disciples from Dou Niu Peak, their expressions vacant, suddenly jolted awake, slowly opening their eyes.</p><p>The shocking sight was that their eyes were blood-red, and within, a worm-like shadow could be seen wriggling. Fang stared at their eyes, silently chanting an incantation. The blood-red in their eyes faded, the shadows disappeared, and their eyes gradually regained their luster, their expressions becoming animated and normal.</p><p>The two looked at Fang.</p><p>Fang's lips moved silently, speaking without sound.</p><p>“Brother Fang!”</p><p>After a moment of silence, they whispered.</p><p>Then, they looked towards Dongming Island.  Hong, the cultivator, bowed slightly and gestured, “Brother Gao, please go first.”</p><p>The other nodded and said in a low voice, “The two junior brothers will follow.”</p><p>With that, the two brought out their magic weapons, transforming into white beams of light and soaring into the sky.</p><p>To an outsider, these two appeared to be ordinary cultivators, never imagining that they were actually puppets controlled by blood corpse worms. Once the worms left their bodies, they would instantly become lifeless.</p><p>A smile played on Fang's lips.  His figure flashed, and he followed silently behind the two puppets.</p><p>…</p><p>Dongming Island.</p><p>The transformed individual, along with Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao, went around the mountain and flew towards the back.</p><p>Besides the person they had encountered earlier, they didn't meet anyone else, causing Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Sister Fang, why are you here too?”</p><p>The transformed individual turned and asked.</p><p>Fang Ting giggled, “I also wanted to witness Brother Zhao using the secret technique to break through. Maybe I can learn something for my own Core Formation cultivation later. The senior brothers are exchanging experiences from the recent Dharma Assembly.  My cultivation is so low; I wouldn't gain anything from listening, so I came along with Brother Zhao.  Fortunately, I was there; without my identity, it would have been difficult for Brother Zhang to deceive that uncle, wouldn't it?”</p><p>A blush appeared on the girl's face as she recalled their previous encounter.</p><p>“That's right, thanks to Sister Fang!”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao agreed.</p><p>The transformed individual nodded slightly, but his tone was grave, “Although we deceived that uncle, getting Brother Zhao to the Dark Thunder Wood Forest won’t be easy.”</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>The two were startled and asked in unison.</p><p>As they spoke, the three flew into a wild area.</p><p>Behind the mountain were rolling low hills, like a series of mounds.  The mountains were lush with greenery, the vegetation extremely abundant, with far more life than the outside world.</p><p>However, these were not spirit plants.</p><p>Since the discovery of Dongming Island, the spirit plants outside Longxing Mountain had been completely harvested, leaving only ordinary plants.</p><p>In the woods, one could occasionally see areas sealed by restrictions. These were places where the spiritual energy was most concentrated, ideal for cultivating spirit plants.  These were areas where spirit plants used to be cultivated.</p><p>The transformed individual was familiar with the terrain and led the two through the forest discreetly, avoiding those areas to prevent encountering any Lan Dou Sect cultivators gathering herbs.</p><p>Grabbing a vine, the transformed individual quickly descended the cliff face, identifying their direction as he said, “The area where the Dark Thunder Wood Forest is located also contains several medicinal gardens, cultivating herbs that can utilize the power of the dark thunder in the forest. A senior from the Hundred Herbs Hall will also go there to gather herbs and manage the gardens. With our cultivation, sneaking past him to enter the Dark Thunder Wood Forest will be difficult. The only way I can think of is for the two of us to distract the senior, and then you, Brother Zhao, can seize the opportunity to infiltrate the Dark Thunder Wood Forest. Fortunately, your secret technique isn't very noticeable…”</p><p>Hearing this, disappointment flickered across Fang Ting's face as she looked at Zhao Songqiao, “Brother Zhao, you must be careful when you infiltrate alone; don't get discovered by that senior.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao pondered, “Zhang, do you know that senior's cultivation level?”</p><p>“Core Formation mid-stage.”</p><p>The transformed individual glanced at Zhao Songqiao.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao frowned slightly, then said, “In that case, let's proceed according to Zhang’s plan. My future depends on this, so I will be careful.”</p><p>Hua Shen smiled, a glint in his eyes.  "It seems Senior Brother Zhao is very confident in his escape techniques.  That puts my mind at ease."</p><p>Zhao Songqiao paused, then calmly replied, "Having been a wandering cultivator for so many years, I've naturally dedicated myself to perfecting such skills for self-preservation."</p><p>Hua Shen nodded, saying nothing more and continuing to lead the way.  However, a doubt lingered in his mind.</p><p>Using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to bypass the Lan Dou Men cultivator and get two people inside wasn't difficult.  His proposal was also a way to observe Zhao Songqiao.  The man seemed unconcerned.</p><p>He'd been suspicious of Zhao Songqiao's motives since his initial visit.  Zhao Songqiao mentioned a technique called "引雷破槛," which even Hua Shen's master had never heard of.  He'd secretly used the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to investigate, but found nothing amiss, so he'd let it go.</p><p>Since Zhao Songqiao answered so readily, Hua Shen decided against further investigation. He planned to have the Heavenly Eye Butterfly secretly follow them to see what Zhao Songqiao was truly up to.</p><p>*"He's telling the truth. I get a secret technique and Fang Ting owes me a favor. If he's truly malicious and hiding something that could implicate me, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly can eliminate him.  If there's a larger conspiracy involving Dongming Island and Lan Dou Men, my master might be able to take advantage of the chaos. Though that's highly unlikely."*</p><p>Hua Shen thought this way, feeling he couldn't lose.</p><p>The Dark Thunderwood was not far, but to avoid being seen, they took twice as long to reach it.</p><p>Hua Shen and Fang Ting stopped before a small mountain, the mountain and a large area behind it shrouded in a barrier. Hua Shen produced a token given to him by Jin Yan, and with a flick of his wrist, the barrier's light opened an entrance.</p><p>After entering, Hua Shen briefly observed the area and sent a signal.</p><p>A shadowy figure swiftly entered and blended into the forest's shadows.</p><p>"Senior Brother Zhao, I'll draw them away. You should circle around from the side of the mountain," Hua Shen said, glancing at the shadow, before leading Fang Ting towards the summit.</p><p>Before leaving, he sent a command to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, which concealed itself, silently landing on a nearby tree, remaining perfectly still.</p><p>Neither Fang Ting nor Zhao Songqiao noticed a thing.  Zhao Songqiao would never suspect a butterfly was observing his every move.</p>
