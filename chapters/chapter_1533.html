<h1>Chapter 1524: The Storm (4k)</h1><p>Since Liuli dared to do this, she must have been confident.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was solemn.</p><p>Shi Xue was even more nervous.</p><p>It's a given, which cultivator wouldn't choose their peak condition to attempt a breakthrough?</p><p>Liuli's gamble was incredibly risky. Failure was a minor concern; if it triggered a backlash, she might be unable to stabilize her cultivation, damaging her foundation, and leaving behind irreparable hidden injuries.</p><p>Yet, on Liuli's face, there wasn't the slightest trace of hesitation or worry, only intense focus.</p><p>On the barren plains.</p><p>Plants and trees had turned to charcoal, and large craters dotted the landscape, devoid of any vitality.</p><p>Only Liuli sat alone in the midst of it all, battling the Great Dao and herself.</p><p>Her expression constantly changed. Shi Xue believed it was due to the pain of Liuli's forced breakthrough, but only Qin Sang knew that she was enduring the most violent backlash from the evil cultivation technique's imprint.</p><p>Each passing moment felt agonizingly long, making one restless and impatient.</p><p>Liuli's aura fluctuated, rising and falling markedly, and the fluctuations were becoming increasingly frequent and highly unstable, threatening to spiral out of control at any moment.</p><p>It seemed as though Liuli was about to suffer another painful defeat.</p><p>But from Qin Sang's perspective, Liuli had always been able to maintain her mental fortitude, and the situation was gradually moving in a positive direction!</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The tribulation clouds had clearly dissipated, and the sky was bright.</p><p>Yet, a muffled, thunder-like sound echoed from the void.</p><p>In an instant, the spiritual energy between heaven and earth stirred violently, surging madly towards the center of the wilderness. The spiritual energy rushed like a tide, gathering around Liuli at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>At this moment, Liuli's body seemed to become a funnel, absorbing spiritual energy like a giant whale gulping down a river, while her aura grew stronger and stronger, breaking through the bottleneck with an unstoppable momentum!</p><p>"She did it?"</p><p>Shi Xue looked at the astonishing celestial phenomenon over the wilderness, still finding it hard to believe.</p><p>Her junior sister had actually done it!</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his eyes filled with undisguised admiration for Liuli. "Congratulations! To break through under the Heavenly Tribulation, I'm afraid there are very few people, besides Liuli, who could achieve this."</p><p>"Congratulations to you too..."</p><p>Shi Xue grinned broadly, genuinely happy for Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, deploying several array flags, sealing off the wilderness with a grand array, and turned around, saying, "Let's head back first, so as not to disturb her. She just broke through and needs to stabilize her realm."</p><p>Shi Xue reluctantly glanced at Liuli, then followed Qin Sang back to the Daoist Temple.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang looked Shi Xue up and down, a thought striking him, and he said with a smile, "Should I offer my congratulations to the Sect Master in advance?"</p><p>"Thanks to my junior sister's guidance, I have gained a deeper understanding of the Ice Soul Divine Light, giving me an epiphany-like feeling, and my own cultivation has benefited from it. However, whether these insights will allow me to break through is still unknown. I don't have the same level of talent as my junior sister."</p><p>Shi Xue's face was wreathed in smiles, but her tone was very humble.</p><p>Qin Sang heard this and nodded gently, it seemed that Liuli's improvement of the Ice Soul Divine Light was already making progress.</p><p>......</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Green Sheep Island.</p><p>The waves gently lapped against the rocky shore, splashing white foam and producing a pleasant, rhythmic sound.</p><p>Five people stood on a rock by the shore.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli stood side by side, their backs to the blue sea and sky, looking at the three people who had come to see them off: Tan Hao, Jing Yu, and Shi Xue.</p><p>Over the past two years, Liuli had stabilized her cultivation and, together with Qin Sang, returned to the Northern Star Region to take a look at the ruins left behind after the ascension of the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>The two had settled all their trivial matters and decided to set off.</p><p>Qin Sang mainly made arrangements for the Green Sheep Temple and a few old acquaintances, having no personal attachments.</p><p>Liuli's situation was even simpler.</p><p>Her ties to the Profound Heaven Palace were shallow to begin with. She had returned to the Pavilion of Listening Snow in obedience to her master's orders and had always maintained a cold and beautiful demeanor, with hardly any friends besides Shi Xue.</p><p>Her improvement of the Ice Soul Divine Light was sufficient as repayment from their master-disciple pair to the sect.</p><p>Although the difficulty of cultivating this divine ability was still very high, at least the disciples of the Pavilion of Listening Snow had the hope of mastering it in the future, and the Pavilion of Listening Snow would not be reduced to the end of the main lineage.</p><p>"The mountains are high and the waters are distant, you three fellow Daoists don't need to see us off any further!"</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands, smiling freely.</p><p>Only Shi Xue in the Pavilion of Listening Snow knew of Liuli's whereabouts.</p><p>Shi Xue grasped Liuli's hand, anxiously reminding her, "Junior sister, you must be careful. If Central Continent is truly as prosperous as described, there must be no shortage of top experts and top forces. Alas, you two are too hasty. It would have been safer to wait until you broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage before setting off."</p><p>Jing Yu said with a smile, "I have never doubted Fellow Daoist Qin's abilities. Now, with Fellow Daoist Liuli's assistance, you will surely turn misfortune into good fortune! We will protect Fellow Daoist Qin's orthodoxy here, and await your triumphant return, bringing back good news!"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded heavily. "We will certainly not fail your trust!"</p><p>At their level of cultivation, they were long accustomed to partings, both in life and death.</p><p>There was not much small talk.</p><p>Under the gazes of the three, Qin Sang and Liuli departed discreetly, gradually moving further away, their figures disappearing into the blue waves.</p><p>They avoided prying eyes, quietly escaping the Emerald Bright Archipelago, then sped up, heading northeast, eventually reaching the edge of the storm belt at the easternmost point of the Demon Region.</p><p>That's right, the first step to reaching Central Continent was not to go south, but east!</p><p>The two made slight adjustments in the storm belt, ensuring they were in peak condition, and immediately set off.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang and Liuli turned back, gazing for a long time. They probably wouldn't see such a peaceful and harmonious scene for a long time to come.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Liuli and said softly.</p><p>Liuli kept her gaze fixed on the north, finally taking one last, deep look at the depths of the sky, and then summoned the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle.</p><p>The two flashed inside, and the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle transformed into a streak of green light, charging into the storm belt.</p><p>After they left, rumors were spread from the Green Sheep Temple and the Pavilion of Listening Snow that Qin Sang and Liuli, the husband and wife, had both entered closed-door cultivation on Green Sheep Island, cultivating the Great Dao together, vowing not to emerge until they broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>At the Green Sheep Temple's celebration, Qin Sang had already hinted at this.</p><p>After they left, the legend of the North Star Double Fiends not only did not weaken in the slightest, but instead became more and more exaggerated. However, no one ever saw the true faces of the North Star Double Fiends again.</p><p>The battle at the sacred ground had a far-reaching impact.</p><p>For a long time afterward, the Northern Sea, ironically, did not experience any large-scale wars.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace suffered internal strife and heavy losses.</p><p>Tong Lingyu not only had to prepare for her own breakthrough to the late Nascent Soul stage, but also had to help Luo Yun heal and stabilize the situation in the sect. She had no energy to expand, at most dividing some of her forces to carve up some important islands in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had fallen, and no one could control the Nine-Headed Great Sage, who was eager to make a move.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Heavenly Roc Great Sage and many demon kings had perished at the sacred ground. Even if the Nine-Headed Great Sage was stronger, and gathered all the current power of the demon race, it was still unable to break out of the Demon Region and contend with the entire human race, so it could only retreat to the Demon Region and continue to lie dormant.</p><p>As for the Demonic Path, not only had they lost the top experts among the demonic cultivators, but many demonic inheritances had also been buried at the bottom of the Exquisite Pagoda, making it unlikely for them to gain any significant influence within a thousand years.</p><p>The Boundless Sea had originally been a paradise for evil demons and unorthodox cultivators, but now the situation was reversed. These evil demons were powerless to prevent the infiltration of orthodox forces, frequently being hunted down, forced to leave their homes, hide everywhere, and endure hardships.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Demons Assembly did continue, but it was no longer worthy of its name, becoming a grand event for the entire Northern Sea.</p><p>The Green Sheep Temple developed steadily in this environment.</p><p>The fierce reputation of the North Star Double Fiends was at its peak, and their residual prestige remained.</p><p>The Green Sheep Temple and the Profound Heaven Palace clearly had a close relationship.</p><p>Although the North Star Double Fiends never appeared, the Green Sheep Temple did not lack Nascent Soul cultivators. On the surface, there was Tan Hao, and there was also Jing Yu, who could not openly show himself, and was rumored to be a mysterious expert.</p><p>In its early days, no one dared to underestimate the Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>When disciples traveled, upon learning that they were from the Green Sheep Temple, they were invariably treated with great courtesy.</p><p>Until much later, the North Star Double Fiends completely disappeared, never having made a public appearance, and the legends gradually ceased to be believed. Some people began to question the North Star Double Fiends.</p><p>Perhaps they had been devoured by a secret technique's backlash and died in their cave dwelling, and had been playing tricks all these years.</p><p>Perhaps they were seriously injured and had long since fallen. If they had really suppressed so many powerful demon and fiend experts, how could there be no price to pay?</p><p>......</p><p>By then, the Green Sheep Temple had already grown and no longer feared rumors.</p><p>However, all of this had nothing to do with Qin Sang and Liuli, who had long since left their homeland.</p><p>They could not have predicted how the situation in the Northern Sea would develop in the future. They were currently focused entirely, with undivided attention, on dealing with the impact of the storm.</p><p>The sky was dark and gloomy.</p><p>The hurricane was like messy ink splattered from the sky, wantonly smearing this world, shattering all peace, and bringing about an apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Right in the midst of the chaotic hurricane.</p><p>There was a faint glimmer of green, shifting and maneuvering, speeding through.</p><p>The green light was not bright, and compared to the overwhelming storm, it was as dim as a dying candle, making one can't help but worry that it might be extinguished by the hurricane at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang, his incarnation, and Liuli were squeezed into the interior space of the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle, minimizing the shuttle's presence as much as possible to avoid attracting unknown dangers.</p><p>At this time, Liuli was in charge of the shuttle.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways, looking outside the shuttle, his gaze profound.</p><p>He was not unfamiliar with the storm belt, but this time was different.</p><p>When he first entered the Northern Sea, although he had expended a great deal of energy, he was certain that as long as he continued forward, he would be able to pass through the storm belt and reach the Northern Sea.</p><p>This journey, the road ahead was unpredictable.</p><p>They needed to make a long detour, using a series of shelters, in order to reach Central Continent.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that even if everything went smoothly, it would still take years.</p><p>And the storm belt was fraught with danger. Any slight change could lead to their demise. After reaching a shelter, they had to be extremely careful, cautiously confirming the conditions of the road ahead.</p><p>The time spent would increase exponentially.</p><p>The first shelter was in the due east, marked on the sea chart with a tree, a tree beneath the sea.</p><p>Based on the estimated distance, with Liuli and the incarnation taking turns controlling the shuttle, they wouldn't need to consume pills or absorb spirit stones. Before the incarnation's strength was exhausted, they should be able to reach the vicinity of that tree.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body was the strongest.</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, he would keep his main body's combat strength as much as possible to deal with unexpected situations.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>One after another, gray hurricanes almost brushed past the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle, speeding by at extreme velocity.</p><p>The storm was unpredictable.</p><p>Liuli held the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn in one hand, skillfully maneuvering the shuttle to dodge, sometimes leaping high, sometimes taking a winding path, threading the needle, as if dancing on the tip of a blade.</p><p>If it were a lower-level cultivator, let alone controlling the shuttle, facing constant danger and keeping their mind constantly tense, they would probably collapse on their own before long.</p><p>Gradually entering the depths of the storm belt.</p><p>Even hiding inside the shuttle, Qin Sang still felt increasingly oppressed, and this was not even the most terrifying aspect of the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled gently, putting aside distracting thoughts, and a demonic banner appeared in his palm.</p><p>He calmed his mind and entered a meditative state, activating the fire lotus in his purple府 (Fǔ - an energy center), silently refining demonic fire, cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique.</p><p>The external incarnation sat cross-legged beside Qin Sang, also cultivating a secret technique.</p><p>Liuli had kept her promise and passed on the "Ice Soul Divine Light" to him.</p><p>After weighing the options, Qin Sang ultimately decided to let the incarnation try the "Ice Soul Divine Light" first.</p><p>Although it was very difficult, once mastered, the formless and immaterial Ice Soul Divine Light could assist the main body in restricting opponents, achieving extraordinary effects.</p><p>It was more suitable for the external incarnation than the Fallen Nether Divine Restriction and the Profound Heaven One Breath Great Capture Hand.</p><p>In addition to this.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit insects were also working hard.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had just advanced not long ago and was still far from the late stage of the fourth transformation.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's attempt to break through to the fourth transformation had failed. This time, Qin Sang had commissioned someone to refine many Fire Melting Pills, enough for consumption on the road, hoping to use a massive amount of pills to help it break through the bottleneck.</p><p>After the Fat Silkworm devoured the poison sac of the Frog Fish, it became silent, no longer crying out for hunger, and remained in a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if the Fat Silkworm could undergo a metamorphosis, and could only pray that it wouldn't cause any trouble in the storm belt. The tribulation of spirit insects was relatively weak, but in this kind of place, it would also be a big problem.</p><p>As for Ya Gu, Qin Sang still had no good solution.</p><p>He had already completely inscribed the bone curse taught by Bai onto Ya Gu's body.</p><p>The effect was remarkable.</p><p>Ya Gu's soul was stable, her aura was calm, her face was rosy, and she didn't show any signs of aging. She looked as if she was asleep, but she showed no signs of waking up.</p><p>Qin Sang could only hope that the Fat Silkworm would advance to the fourth transformation, perhaps bringing new changes to Ya Gu.</p><p>......</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The roar of the hurricane drowned out the sound of the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle speeding.</p><p>There was no distinction between day and night in the storm belt.</p><p>They had been speeding for an unknown amount of time, and still, they could see no end in sight.</p><p>Even though the shuttle's consumption was not great, Liuli's true essence had already been depleted by seventy to eighty percent, and a hint of fatigue showed in her focused expression.</p><p>Her eyes flickered slightly, and taking advantage of a moment when the storm was not so intense, she awakened Qin Sang's external incarnation.</p><p>The external incarnation awoke, said "thank you for your hard work," and immediately took over the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn and control of the shuttle.</p><p>Liuli nodded, closing her eyes tightly, seizing every moment to recover.</p><p>It was just that the elemental energy in the storm belt was too chaotic, not as stable as in a shelter, making the efficiency too low. In this kind of place, one still had to rely on spirit pills and spirit stones.</p><p>Both she and Qin Sang had prepared plenty of these.</p><p>There was some discrepancy from Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>It was only after the external incarnation's strength was exhausted, and Qin Sang took over and sped onward for a while, that they finally reached the location recorded on the sea chart.</p><p>The scenery in the storm belt was all the same.</p><p>This place was no exception.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the violent seawater below, simultaneously using a secret thought technique to sense. A moment later, his expression showed joy, and he suddenly steered the shuttle to descend rapidly.</p><p>The sea was not a pure land; chaotic forces were everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang avoided the乱流 (Luànliú - turbulent currents), his target clear. After speeding not far, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was the first to see a long, thin shadow.</p><p>Just as depicted on the sea chart.</p><p>It was a tree, with a slender trunk, standing firm amidst the turbulent currents, growing out from the seabed, its depth unknown. The trunk was straight, until the very top, where it expanded into a crown.</p><p>It was not the kind of tree found on land, but more like coral.</p><p>The crown was the size of a room, but how insignificant it was in the vast ocean.</p><p>Moreover, the entire coral tree was gray, without any special fluctuations, and completely invisible from the sea surface.</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue in wonder, truly not knowing how the predecessors who drew the sea chart had discovered this place.</p><p>He glanced around, confirming that there were no dangers nearby, and steered the shuttle directly towards a branch. He felt no resistance, landing lightly.</p>
