<h1>Chapter 1927:  The Ling Shi</h1><p>"Please, Daoist Master, come in."</p><p>The City Lord of Yun Ding City, dressed in fine silks, exuded an air of refined elegance and authority, a nobility far surpassing that of any earthly ruler.  His powerful cultivation underpinned this aura.</p><p>Qin Sang’s visits were infrequent, but the two were already quite familiar with each other.</p><p>They settled into their seats.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could speak, the City Lord of Yun Ding City swept his sleeve, and several jade vials appeared on the table.</p><p>"This vial contains Scattered Flower Elixir, and this is the Yin Sui Pill..."</p><p>The City Lord of Yun Ding City introduced each one.</p><p>The vials contained either elixirs or liquids, all sharing a common characteristic: potent poisons, potent enough to make even Nascent Soul cultivators turn pale with fear.</p><p>"The Yin Sui Pill was personally refined by me; the others were collected from various sources.  Unfortunately, Daoist Master’s requirements are quite high, and despite my best efforts, I’ve only managed to gather this much..."</p><p>After explaining the properties of each, the City Lord pushed the vials towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, then released the seals on the vials and sensed the potency of the poisons within.</p><p>Seeing that he made no effort to protect himself, the City Lord’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, even without his poison pills, Qin Sang's knowledge of poisons was extremely profound.</p><p>Qin Sang examined each one and nodded slightly. These poisons would suffice for his cultivation of the *Poison God Scripture*.</p><p>The problem was the insufficient quantity; he was still far from his goal!</p><p>The City Lord was a master alchemist, but such potent poisons weren't easily refined, and he couldn't possibly dedicate all his efforts solely to Qin Sang's needs.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, recalling the days in the flower fields, when the flower dew flowed endlessly – what a blessed existence that was.</p><p>"With your status and position, Daoist friend, this is all you could obtain?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "Apart from this, have you discovered any other clues?  Are there any places in this world born from the Yin energy of Heaven and Earth, places of extreme negativity?"</p><p>Such places were the most likely to nurture extremely poisonous substances.</p><p>The City Lord shook his head slightly.  "Yun Du Mountain is a bright and spiritually pure place, immune to evil.  Even if there were any, they would have been suppressed by the experts of Yun Du Heaven long ago. The most negative place is the Falling Soul Abyss. But… even the most ferocious devils of Mu Luo Mountain dare not trespass into the Falling Soul Abyss.  As for Mu Luo Mountain itself, I govern an entire city, with countless eyes watching my every move. I must avoid contact with that area as much as possible."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, sensing the unspoken implications in the City Lord's words.  "Yun Ding City is renowned throughout Yun Du Mountain and Mu Luo Mountain as a sacred ground of alchemy.  Surely many cultivators from Mu Luo Mountain must disguise themselves and come seeking pills.  Some rumors must surface. Can you reveal anything?"</p><p>The City Lord feigned hesitation. "There are some rumors, the truth of which is unclear… Daoist Master, are you familiar with Ling Shi?"</p><p>"Ling Shi? I've never heard of him."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>"Ling Shi is known as the number one poison cultivator of Mu Luo Mountain, his poison arts unparalleled, killing without a trace. Other devils flee hundreds of miles at the mere sight of him. He is a master of poisons and must have extensive knowledge of worldly poisons. I have here a stone bead, said to be crafted by Ling Shi.  Presenting this bead will allow you to enlist his aid."</p><p>As he spoke, the City Lord produced a milky-white stone bead, far less clear than a jade bead, seemingly ordinary.</p><p>Even cultivators as powerful as Qin Sang and the City Lord could sense the peculiar energy within the bead, a unique mark.</p><p>Qin Sang took it and examined it closely.  "Where did this bead come from?"</p><p>"That's the biggest problem; its origins are untraceable," the City Lord sighed.  "Legend says that only those who have shown kindness to Ling Shi or been favored by him would receive such a bead. I had heard of these beads before, and since you need this, I kept this one."</p><p>The implication was clear: approaching Ling Shi directly with the bead was risky, as he might retaliate with a poisonous strike if he didn't recognize the bearer.</p><p>He added, "Ling Shi is elusive; nobody knows where his lair is. I've tried many methods, all to no avail. This bead offers the only hope of finding him."</p><p>"If Daoist friend is willing to part with it, I will gladly accept."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the bead. After assessing its value alongside the poisons, he produced three jade vials of his own.</p><p>Inside were three vials of the purest blood from Nascent Soul-stage demonic beasts – the remnants of his own hunts of demon lords and ferocious beasts, nearly all he had left.</p><p>These are from the relics of two demon kings—a huge haul, enough for him to enjoy for a while.</p><p>Besides this, Qin Sang also has the corpse of a Nascent Soul stage demon beast, but it's not suitable for trading here.</p><p>Anything favored by a demon king is the very essence of a demonic beast or ferocious beast.</p><p>The City Lord of Yun Ding City is so keen because these things are too tempting.</p><p>Seeing the jade bottles, the City Lord's eyes lit up. He picked one up and released the seal.</p><p>"Indeed, it's the purest blood essence! With this, my success rate will increase by at least 20%!"</p><p>The City Lord was intoxicated.  Noticing Qin Sang's intent to leave, he quickly called out, "Daoist Priest, please wait, I have another matter to discuss."</p><p>"What is it, City Lord?"</p><p>The City Lord quickly put away the three bottles of blood essence and said solemnly, "I'm actually acting on someone's behalf. A fellow Daoist discovered an ancient restriction, possibly concealing an ancient secret realm, but it's also dangerous. He wishes to find help to break the restriction. If you're interested, Daoist Priest, I can introduce you to this Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang's possession of so many demon bones and blood suggests formidable strength and the air of a solitary cultivator—perfectly fitting the employer's requirements.</p><p>"An ancient restriction? Can you determine its age and location?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred, secretly wondering if it had anything to do with the Thunder Altar.</p><p>"It's probably over ten thousand years old; the exact time is hard to determine.  All I can tell you, Daoist Priest, is that it's east of Yun Du City, possibly the ruins of a vanished sect," the City Lord said cautiously.</p><p>It seems unrelated to the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Qin Sang judged that the Thunder Altar's range extended at most to the western edge of Yun Du Mountain, and the timeframe wouldn't be this recent.</p><p>"Daoist Priest, you could ask that fellow Daoist to accompany you to Mu Luo Mountain.  With two Daoist Priests visiting together, Ling Shi wouldn't dare act recklessly," the City Lord added.</p><p>Qin Sang showed little interest, rose, bowed slightly, and said, "Thank you for your kindness, but my cultivation is incomplete; I dare not be distracted."</p><p>Leaving Yun Ding City, Qin Sang traveled west without stopping.</p><p>The journey was smooth.</p><p>Qin Sang crossed the Firelands and entered the Mu Luo Mountain range.</p><p>Upon entering Mu Luo Mountain, he felt a stark contrast to Yun Du Mountain.</p><p>Perhaps it was preconceived notions.</p><p>Yun Du Mountain felt balanced and peaceful, but Mu Luo Mountain, even at midday under the scorching sun, had a pervasive, gloomy atmosphere.</p><p>Qin Sang flew high, deep into Mu Luo Mountain, and soon saw several battles—life-or-death struggles.</p><p>While not everywhere was chaotic, the cultivators and demon cultivators Qin Sang encountered possessed a predominantly ruthless air.</p><p>He continued his flight.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A white cloud passed over a mountain peak. Suddenly, a green rainbow shot from below.</p><p>Within the rainbow was a long arrow engraved with runes, its tip reflecting a cold, sharp gleam.</p><p>The arrow pierced the air with astonishing speed, reaching the cloud in an instant, aiming to pierce it.</p><p>Had the person on the cloud been weak or unprepared, they would likely have been severely injured or killed.</p><p>This is Mu Luo Mountain—attacks can come at any moment, without reason.  One can only be vigilant.</p><p>Just as the arrow was about to pierce the cloud, it suddenly froze, restrained by an invisible force.</p><p>Below, outside a cave, a man in black robes, a Yuan Ying cultivator, stood with a longbow.</p><p>He had fired the arrow.</p><p>Seeing his enchanted arrow easily trapped, the man's expression changed. Understanding he had provoked someone powerful, he unhesitatingly dashed into the cave, activating all the restrictions.</p><p>He tried to escape using the cave's formations.</p><p>However, the earth rumbled. A huge hand emerged from the void, easily piercing the mountain, grabbing him.</p><p>The man looked at the Daoist priest in terror.</p><p>"Have you heard anything about Ling Shi recently?"</p><p>The Daoist asked calmly.</p><p>"Junior... junior has never seen Ling Shi, senior, forgive me! Senior, spare my life!"</p><p>The man pleaded repeatedly.</p><p>The void hand pressed down, instantly crushing the man into the ground, leaving no trace.</p><p>The Daoist was Qin Sang.  He frowned, looking ahead.  This was not far from the location marked on the stone bead. Could Ling Shi's cave not be here?</p><p>He could only wait for Ling Shi to come to him, hoping Ling Shi hadn't left.</p><p>Qin Sang continued onward, flying over dozens of mountain ranges, before landing in a flat valley. He took out the stone bead.</p><p>He had brought the bead here, but he sensed no change from it; he couldn't pinpoint Ling Shi's location.</p><p>Qin Sang released his spiritual sense, sweeping the area. Finding nothing unusual, he chose a rock, sat cross-legged, and waited patiently.</p><p>…</p><p>At a lake some distance away.</p><p>Beneath the lakebed’s mud and sand lay a large, solid black stone.  The interior of the black stone was hollowed out and carved into a cave dwelling.</p><p>Several figures were searching within the cave.</p><p>Their attire was peculiar: crimson robes that covered them from head to toe.  Twisted patterns, of uncertain meaning, were etched onto the backs of the robes.  The patterns differed slightly between individuals; two figures displayed more intricate designs, indicating higher status.</p><p>These two, their true energy somewhat depleted, sat facing each other, meditating and conversing.</p><p>“That old viper, Ling Shi, is truly cunning.  The eye of the formation wasn’t in the cave dwelling after all!  It’s a pity; despite Master Tu Yuan’s unparalleled strategy, we failed to capture him,” one of them, taller and more slender, sighed.</p><p>His companion, short and stout with a protruding belly that strained his robe, chuckled darkly.</p><p>“We merely failed to capture him on the spot. Master Tu Yuan has him trapped; escape is impossible. Surrender is just a matter of time! The Ancestor specifically requested his capture. Even if he flees to the ends of the earth, what difference does it make?  If the old viper remains defiant, once the Ancestor intervenes, it will be more than just capture!”</p><p>“The Ancestor’s intervention would mean Master Tu Yuan’s failure, and we would all suffer the consequences. Let us hope that day never comes,” the taller cultivator shuddered, seemingly recalling something dreadful.  “Although the old viper escaped, he didn’t have time to destroy everything in the cave dwelling. Hopefully, we’ll find some secrets that will help Master Tu Yuan capture him, so we can report back!”</p><p>At that moment, a幽光 (glowing light) burst forth from within the cave dwelling, accompanied by a cracking sound.</p><p>The two rejoiced, “Another chamber has been opened! The remaining wards were surprisingly strong; it took half a month to breach this one!”</p><p>Their subordinates streamed out, carrying various objects from the cave – treasures and what seemed like mere junk. They examined each item carefully, scrutinizing every detail, leaving nothing unchecked.</p><p>Suddenly, the stout cultivator felt something and glanced sideways, catching sight of a stone mirror.</p><p>The mirror was circular, standing on a roughly hewn pedestal about a yard high. The mirror and pedestal were made of the same material, but the mirror’s surface was highly polished, reflecting perfectly.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>The stout cultivator showed surprise.</p><p>The mirror had been in the main hall, examined countless times, and they’d seen nothing special about it.</p><p>Now, a faint light appeared on the mirror’s surface.  The instant the light appeared, lines emerged, forming what they instantly recognized (given their long stakeout) as a map of the surrounding terrain.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>They exchanged glances.</p><p>The taller cultivator’s eyes lit up.  “This mirror isn’t a scouting artifact; otherwise, the old viper would have noticed us!”</p><p>“You mean…?” the stout cultivator pondered.</p><p>“If that light point represents a person, it must be someone closely connected to the old viper!  Capturing them might force the old viper to surrender!” the taller cultivator declared.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of the old viper having any relatives or disciples,” the stout cultivator hesitated.</p><p>“We'll find out soon enough. You! Come here!”</p><p>The taller cultivator summoned his subordinates, leaving the cave and flying towards the location indicated by the light point.  However, they didn’t fully reveal themselves.  Once their energy was fully restored, they approached cautiously, observing from a distance, and sent two subordinates ahead to scout.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, Qin Sang had already noticed their approach.</p><p>Sitting on the rock, Qin Sang remained motionless, observing their actions, his curiosity piqued.</p><p>Could these people be Ling Shi’s subordinates?</p><p>Why did they act so strangely? Their auras were also odd; not like those who practice poison arts, but filled with corpse qi—more like a group of corpse cultivators.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of cold wind swept in from the mountains, and two figures in crimson robes appeared, landing before Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Thud! Thud!’</p><p>Their bodies seemed incredibly heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang rose from the rock.  As he looked at them, a flicker of recognition crossed his eyes, triggering a long-dormant memory: the Flying Night Rakshasa.  He had a pretty good idea who they were.</p><p>From beneath the robes, four icy gazes fixed upon Qin Sang.  One of them uttered a raspy voice, coldly demanding, “Who are you? State your name! And any identifying tokens you possess.”</p>
