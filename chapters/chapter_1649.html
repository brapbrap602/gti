<h1>Chapter 1640: A Strategic Exchange</h1><p>Chapter 1640: A Strategic Exchange</p><p>Amidst the collapsing palace, the cry of the weeping spirit master was particularly shrill, abruptly ceasing as the once powerful figure perished.  The grotesque-faced man, ruthless and fickle, had just moments before pledged cooperation, promising to help the weeping spirit master regain his physical form and ascend to apotheosis.  Yet, with a shift in circumstance, he mercilessly killed him!</p><p>This act severed Qin Sang's access to the Heavenly Linglong secrets through other channels.  To obtain the secrets, she must accept his terms!</p><p>His words were cut short by the simultaneous attack of the sunbird and a ferocious beast—a serpent-like creature—that overwhelmed him.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man dodged clumsily, cursing inwardly. He couldn't fathom whether Qin Sang possessed absolute confidence in capturing him or was merely acting tough to lower his bargaining power.  Regardless, he absolutely didn't believe anyone would be unmoved by the Heavenly Linglong secrets.</p><p>…</p><p>The ice palace crumbled at an accelerating pace, forming a ring of ice shards that rapidly expanded outward, leveling the surrounding structures with the shockwaves from the flag array.</p><p>It seemed to echo the ice palace's destruction.</p><p>The battle in the forest reached its climax.</p><p>It could no longer be called a forest.</p><p>Qin Sang had unleashed a massive fire, turning the woods into scorched earth. Only a patch of green remained in the center, completely overshadowed by the demonic flames.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ice ring swept over the Qilin screen wall, leaving behind a vast expanse of white rubble.  The dust and debris, struck by the ice ring, swirled back with even greater force.</p><p>Above the Bingyi Palace, a clear demarcation line of black and white formed.</p><p>Inside the ice ring, a deep blue light pulsed, like a jewel embedded in the ground, on the verge of eruption.</p><p>At this moment, only a few intact flag shadows remained in the dark hall, desperately holding on as the others lay shattered.</p><p>Finally,</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>With a synchronized snapping sound, the remaining flags broke.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The external celestial light exploded!</p><p>An intensely concentrated blue beam, like a sharp arrow, pierced the heavens.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The blue light, even faster than the ice ring, swept across all directions!</p><p>…</p><p>The stone beach at the entrance of the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>More and more awakened puppets surged forth.</p><p>The puppets crowded the beach, a sea of darkness.</p><p>The Poison King, Master Huaiyin, and Fan Laomo escaped the puppets, bursting from the eastern side of the beach, diverging from Qin Sang’s group.</p><p>Seeing the scene within the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, they hesitated, unsure where to go first.</p><p>Mount Disu was undeniably the most striking feature.  Even without knowing its name or history, they sensed it was the heart of the legacy grounds.  However, Mount Disu remained tranquil, devoid of any unusual phenomena.</p><p>When they first entered the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, there had been activity near the cliff face, suggesting a struggle for something, but it quickly subsided. By the time they reached the beach, the clifftop was silent.</p><p>Other areas occasionally flickered with strange lights, but it was unclear whether this was due to combat or fluctuations in the Wuxiang Immortal Gate's restrictions.</p><p>So many experts entered before them; where had they all gone?</p><p>The Daoist sect and the Wuxiang Immortal Gate had a deep-seated feud; surely they wouldn't have formed an unspoken agreement to divide the treasures of the legacy grounds?</p><p>As the three observed,</p><p>A blue light erupted from the direction of Mount Disu, too bright to be concealed even by the heavenly sword array.  It was clearly visible even from the entrance of the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>Their gazes locked onto Mount Disu.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The Poison King led the charge.</p><p>Mount Disu was too important to ignore, and the recent disturbance there removed all doubt.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, a visitor from another land, trusted the Poison King's judgment, following closely behind.</p><p>Fan Laomo hesitated momentarily, scanning the entire legacy grounds as if searching for something, before finally joining them.</p><p>…</p><p>In an unnamed valley.</p><p>The blood net gradually tightened, revealing Su Zinan and a demonic banner.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A slight smirk played on Su Zinan’s lips as he reached out and grasped the Three Corpse Death God Banner.</p><p>He held it fondly, caressing the banner's surface.</p><p>The banner vibrated in his hand.</p><p>Su Zinan snorted, gripping it firmly, about to make a move, when he too was startled by the soaring blue light.  His expression turned one of surprise. He quickly put away the banner and fled.</p><p>…</p><p>The northern region of the legacy grounds.</p><p>Located behind the cliff face, this area had once been a forbidden zone of the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>It was impossible to determine what had once existed within this forbidden area, as it had been reduced to ruins, more severely damaged than the Bingyi Palace, indicating an incredibly fierce battle.</p><p>The ruins were completely shrouded in darkness.</p><p>In the pitch-black area, remnants of restrictions drifted everywhere, creating a perilous environment.</p><p>Darkness had reigned for countless years, until a different light finally broke through.</p><p>Three figures, Zi Lei Zhenren, He Gao Zhenren, and Yue Lingtian, burst from the darkness, converging at the edge of the forbidden zone.</p><p>They had pursued Zhu Wu Dao deep into the forbidden area.</p><p>Earlier, the three had split up to search.</p><p>"Brother Dao, did you find no weakness in Old Devil Zhu?"</p><p>Yue Lingtian's disappointment was evident as he saw Zi Lei Zhenren return empty-handed.</p><p>To their shame, the three great cultivators had failed to capture Zhu Wu Dao, even with a combined assault.  Although he had used the terrain to his advantage, their failure was still a blow to their pride.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren gazed back at the forbidden zone, pondering.  "Old Devil Zhu is certainly hidden behind one of the zone's restrictions.  With a thorough search, we could force him out. However, that would be too time-consuming. Zhu Wu Dao is only one; numerous experts have entered the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate.  If they unite…"</p><p>Before he finished, a blue light shot up near Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren recalled something, exclaiming, "That's Bing Yi Palace! Someone is vying for the Water Phase inheritance!"</p><p>He turned to Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>There was another reason he hadn't mentioned.</p><p>If they remained empty-handed before outside forces arrived, their sect leader's plan would be a complete failure.</p><p>From the moment the teleportation array went dark, He Gao Zhenren's thoughts had been in turmoil.</p><p>He dared not contemplate the implications of the severed Immortal Path.</p><p>As the junior sect leader, he had never needed to worry about the sect's development; sheltered and carefree.</p><p>He never imagined that the Eight Scenic Views, the head of the Daoist sects, would one day face such peril.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's expression remained calm, his gaze unwavering.</p><p>Even the extinguished teleportation array seemed to be within his expectations, causing no ripple in his composure.</p><p>"To Di Shou Mountain!" Zi Lei Zhenren decisively made his decision.</p><p>Shortly after the three left, a shadowy figure emerged at the edge of the forbidden zone.  Glancing towards Di Shou Mountain, it left behind a chilling laugh before vanishing.</p><p>Di Shou Mountain was in sight.</p><p>Instead of heading directly there, the three veered slightly to investigate Bing Yi Palace.</p><p>Suddenly, Yue Lingtian stopped.  The other two noticed and halted, turning to him.</p><p>Yue Lingtian gazed towards the east side of Di Shou Mountain, where the terrain was complex and difficult to discern.  He said gravely, "I recall Brother Dao mentioning that the Earth Phase Hall lies east of Di Shou Mountain."</p><p>"Correct.  The Golden Phase Hall lies between Di Shou Mountain and the Earth Phase Hall.  Going directly east across a large river will lead you there. Each branch has clear markers.  It's said the Earth Phase Hall is the largest of the five branches…"</p><p>He Gao Zhenren replied, then realized something,  "Sect Leader Yue…"</p><p>Yue Lingtian bowed to the two.  "With the Immortal Path severed and the Grand Elder blocked outside the Legacy Mansion, the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate's inheritances are limited, yet highly contested. As sect leader, I bear the responsibility of my sect's prosperity; the Earth Phase Hall's opportunity cannot be missed. After obtaining the Earth Phase inheritance, I will rejoin you two at Di Shou Mountain."</p><p>Without giving them a chance to respond, Yue Lingtian's figure turned into a yellowish-brown light and shot towards the Earth Phase Hall, showing no interest in Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren opened his mouth, but couldn't stop him.</p><p>Though Yue Lingtian didn't explicitly state it, his resentment towards the Eight Scenic Views was evident.</p><p>After all, Yue Lingtian had staked his entire sect on this plan with the Eight Scenic Views, only to have the Immortal Path severed and their promises broken.</p><p>Most sects would have reacted far more strongly.</p><p>Anyone would suspect the Eight Scenic Views' motives. Yue Lingtian's restraint was remarkable.</p><p>His withdrawal under the guise of seeking the Earth Phase inheritance and observing the situation was entirely understandable.</p><p>The Eight Scenic Views were struggling to cope with their own issues.  He Gao Zhenren didn't know how to comfort Yue Lingtian.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Zi Lei Zhenren let out an almost imperceptible sigh.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>…</p><p>Bing Yi Palace.</p><p>The sky was bathed in a brilliant blue light.</p><p>The shockwave spread at an astonishing speed, engulfing the battlefield in an instant.</p><p>After a fierce battle, the grotesque-faced man was battered and bruised.  His left arm was broken and charred, his mobility severely restricted by the demonic fire, clearly losing ground.</p><p>When the intense blue light erupted, the earth-shattering force and dazzling light caused Qin Sang to instinctively squint, momentarily losing her focus.  In that instant…</p><p>The grotesque, scarred man, fighting like a cornered beast, suddenly ceased his resistance and his persuasive words. He froze, eerily still.</p><p>He had been waiting for the right moment.</p><p>The supposed "divine opportunity," the "Celestial Exquisite"—all delaying tactics.  Of course, if Qin Sang showed any interest, he wouldn't have minded a deal.</p><p>He waited for the precise moment the great array would collapse!</p><p>A raspy, guttural chuckle escaped his throat.  Intense green light erupted from his scarred torso.</p><p>The light pulsed from the cracks in his bark-like skin, like countless green blades, slicing his body into countless fragments of varying sizes.</p><p>His emerald eyes fixed on Qin Sang, his pupils reflecting his image.</p><p>The grotesque man wanted to remember Qin Sang forever. He'd been pushed to this point, all thanks to Qin Sang. Ironically, he hated Qin Sang more than he hated his other self.</p><p>The green light intensified to its peak.</p><p>The grotesque man's wood-like body exploded almost simultaneously with the azure celestial light.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Countless splinters of wood shot outwards. Each piece was encased in a ball of green light.</p><p>All the green lights emitted a consistent wave, dispersing into the starry sky.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  The grotesque man had waited for a chance to escape; Qin Sang had been waiting too.</p><p>The Serpent’s Tail lashed out, spewing frigid flames, instantly obliterating vast swathes of fragments. The Solar God Bird swooped down, combining its power with the Nine Netherworld Devilfire, destroying countless more, yet the grotesque man was nowhere to be found!</p><p>However, as the grotesque man self-destructed, Qin Sang unleashed his divine sense and Celestial Eye abilities without reservation, simultaneously channeling his True Essence into the fluff.</p><p>A long-planned move, finally executed!</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The power of the Wan Du Mountain treasure within the fluff was activated, instantly turning to white ash.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Jin Chen sword moved of its own accord, striking an empty space.</p><p>An extremely faint speck of light was fleeing towards that spot—the very essence of the wood-like body.</p><p>Although the grotesque man used countless fragments as a disguise and suppressed his energy fluctuations to the utmost, nothing could escape the Celestial Eye. Qin Sang's divine sense simultaneously locked onto the light, sensing the fluctuations of a soul within.</p><p>As the sword was about to strike the speck of light, the Jin Chen sword transformed into a sword array again.  The grotesque man, having lost his physical body, faced the impact of the Seven Souls Slaughter Array; capture seemed inevitable.</p><p>"Aaah!"</p><p>The sword array appeared, and a scream echoed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the scream came from elsewhere.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang discovered that the energy signature in the speck of light wasn't the grotesque man's, but the Crying Spirit Cave Master's!</p><p>This man, having killed the Crying Spirit Cave Master before Qin Sang's very eyes and feigning decisiveness, had actually held back. He had decisively abandoned his wood-like body's essence, merging the Cave Master's remnant soul to deceive Qin Sang and used a "substitution" tactic.</p><p>But he hadn't anticipated that Qin Sang didn't solely rely on divine sense. The Celestial Eye instantly pinpointed the source.</p><p>He also hadn't expected Qin Sang to possess the treasure bestowed by Wan Du Mountain.</p><p>The power of the Wan Du Mountain treasure was triggered.</p><p>The residual poison within the grotesque man's body erupted.</p><p>Over the years, he gradually sealed the poison within his body; the scars on his face had faded.  In his prime, it wasn't a major problem, but now he was powerless to suppress it!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes hardened. He raised his hand and pointed.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A bolt of heavenly thunder struck down, creating a deep crater in the ground. A shadowy figure flickered within.</p><p>Qin Sang commented on his cunning.</p><p>The grotesque man had actually transferred his Nascent Soul into the Gu King, utilizing the Gu King's ability to shimmer within the light, drawing the speck underground to escape the fiery ring using an earth-遁術-like technique.</p><p>The Gu King's backlash was real. But the Gu King was personally cultivated by him, and now fully developed, its retaliation might not be as severe as the grotesque man had portrayed.</p><p>If not for the fluff's contribution, Qin Sang would have quickly discovered the discrepancy, but permanently resolving the issue would still require effort.</p><p>The grotesque man's Nascent Soul also bore centipede-like scars; the fierce poison had invaded his soul.</p><p>The residual poison erupted, followed by the thunderbolt.</p><p>His Nascent Soul was severely injured. Seeing the Nine Netherworld Devilfire Qin Sang was about to unleash, his face was filled with pain and terror as he desperately attempted to use a teleportation technique.</p><p>At that moment, the Gu King stared intently at the grotesque man's Nascent Soul, its eyes growing increasingly ferocious. It suddenly let out a shrill cry, spewing a jet of venom onto the Nascent Soul!</p><p>The teleportation technique was disrupted.</p><p>The Nascent Soul recovered, seeing the Gu King inches away, a look of shock on its face.</p><p>The next moment, a heart-wrenching scream echoed.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared above the crater, witnessing the gruesome sight, and couldn't help but gasp.</p><p>He hadn't expected the blood armored insect to be so ferocious.  Its restrictions barely weakened, it immediately turned on its master without hesitation, leaving Qin Sang no time to intervene.</p><p>The Gu King's poison was incredibly potent.</p><p>The grotesque man's Nascent Soul, repeatedly wounded and unprotected, was struck by the poison, exhausted, and its light dissipated.  It was clearly dying.</p><p>Qin Sang, quick-witted, snatched the pouch that tumbled from the Nascent Soul's fading light, and then used the Devilfire to subdue the blood armored insect, attempting to save the grotesque man.</p>
