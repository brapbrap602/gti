<h1>Chapter 1506: The Primordial Yellow Energy</h1><p>Chapter 1506: The Primordial Yellow Energy</p><p>The environment ahead caused Qin Sang to frown.  Even from a distance, standing on the mountain overlooking the deep valley, she felt a sense of danger.  The Yang Soul Crystal's energy fluctuations were growing stronger; she couldn't tell if the Ghost General was battling someone or facing some other peril in the valley.  No signs of magic weapons or spells were visible from outside, making assessment impossible.  Facing this horde of demons and navigating the unfamiliar cloud sea were individually daunting challenges, but together they presented a formidable threat. Anything could happen.</p><p>Qin Sang considered waiting for Tong Lingyu and the others before entering the valley.  As she pondered, her gaze drifted towards the depths of the cloud sea. The radiant glow emanating from that area pulsed with increasing frequency, the clouds churning, suggesting the imminent appearance of a powerful artifact.  It was highly likely that Hun Mo and the others were behind this, causing the strange light phenomena.  It seemed unlike the Danxiang Pavilion—a place where one could only look but not touch.</p><p>With so many demons gathered, this was likely the heart of the entire stone tablet space.  If they waited, the demons would seize the treasure before they could even get close.  With this in mind, Qin Sang left Liuli behind, concealing herself as she approached alone.</p><p>Jade steps led straight down.  Walking down, Qin Sang noted that the ancient prohibitions on the surrounding cliffs were much weaker than before. The area below, though called a valley, was actually a vast, open space between two mountains.  This probably explained why the demons hadn't erected any barriers.  While a single path could be sealed with a formation, securing such a large area would be incredibly time-consuming and resource-intensive, and might not even deter Xuan Tian Palace—a pointless endeavor.</p><p>Qin Sang left the steps, descending the cliff face slowly, carefully observing her surroundings. She found no hidden dangers, but she did discover traces of a battle.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang landed invisibly before a field of rubble. Among the stones, clear signs of burning were visible, along with three deep furrows, several meters long, cutting through the grass and exposing the yellow earth beneath. The scorch marks were black. Closer inspection revealed that they weren’t caused by fire; the stones appeared to have been eroded by some unknown force, crumbling to black dust at a light touch. The three furrows were neatly aligned, sharply pointed at both ends, clearly claw marks, with a broken feather clinging to the edge of one.</p><p>"Demon cultivators and a demon king fought here. It wasn't intense; they exchanged a single blow and stopped, perhaps rushing into the cloud sea afterwards…" Qin Sang concluded.  She found other signs of conflict, but no trace of the Hun Mo Elder, suggesting disharmony among the demons.</p><p>Qin Sang signaled for Liuli to follow.  Liuli knew fewer of the boundless sea demon cultivators than Qin Sang, and couldn't identify the perpetrators of the battle.</p><p>The two crossed the rubble and soon reached the valley's edge.  A faint breeze wafted out. The mist seemed contained by some force, forming a wall of clouds.  A light mist brushed against their skin, carrying a subtle chill.  From the outside, the valley appeared desolate yet peaceful.</p><p>After a brief discussion, Qin Sang and Liuli entered the valley, one after the other.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The moment they stepped inside, dense fog enveloped them. However, the visibility wasn't as limited as expected. Qin Sang remained vigilant, quickly scanning her surroundings, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>As they entered, a gray light erupted ahead, followed by cracking sounds from the ground. The intense gray light quickly dissipated, leaving a tall iron sword, stuck in the ground not far off. The sword, almost a man's height, lacked inscriptions, a simple, rusty greatsword bearing the marks of time.  Four statues surrounded it, each depicting a previously unseen beast, their heads bowed towards the sword as if guarding a sacred object.  Their expressions, however, were ferocious, their eyes filled with malice.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an intense malevolent aura emanating from the statues; these were no benevolent beings!  She realized the statues were not carved from wood or stone, but from bone – white, skeletal bone that amplified the chilling feeling.</p><p>Sensing the intruders, the four beast heads swiveled, their eyes blazing with killing intent, about to awaken.  A sudden change.</p><p>Qin Sang cried out inwardly, her mind flickered, and the Jin Chen Sword shot out.  The surroundings immediately plunged into darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately deployed the Seven Souls Killing Formation, enveloping themselves.</p><p>Liuli also held the phoenix-shaped sword, her eyes accumulating a幽蓝 light. Sensing danger, she immediately used the Ice Soul Divine Light to assist Qin Sang.</p><p>Although they hadn't coordinated many times, their teamwork was quite seamless.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>As the sword formation took shape, a gray shadow lunged, its speed astonishing, even surpassing Qin Sang's lightning escape technique. It instantly burst into the sword formation.</p><p>It was the closest beast, quadrupedal with horns, resembling a deer.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed not demonic energy, but killing intent.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The sword threads within the formation moved in unison, forming a dense net in the dim space, strangling the beast from all sides.</p><p>The beast opened its mouth, letting out a silent roar. The horn on its head suddenly glowed, then shot out a white light.</p><p>The sword threads, upon contact with the white light, melted like snow in the sun.  Ignoring its surroundings, the beast charged towards Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>Simultaneously, three more gray shadows rushed in.</p><p>All four beasts had been alerted.</p><p>The other three beasts possessed different abilities and speeds.</p><p>One was serpentine, its tail swipe unleashing a green light as powerful as the white light.</p><p>Another carried a turtle shell, incredibly tough.</p><p>The last resembled a qilin, engulfed in flames.</p><p>Besieged by the four beasts, the situation seemed perilous. But after a brief probe, Qin Sang relaxed.</p><p>The beasts' strength was manageable, and they lacked intelligence.</p><p>He transmitted his findings to Liuli, then flicked his finger at the Jinchen Sword, pushing the Seven Souls Killing Formation to its limit.</p><p>Liuli held back the Ice Soul Divine Light, and tossed the phoenix sword.</p><p>The sword, swift as a meteor, pierced directly towards the first beast's forehead.</p><p>The beast, focused solely on the intruders, reacted instinctively, its horn gathering white light to fire a thick beam towards the oncoming sword.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The white and sword lights collided, scattering light.</p><p>The phoenix sword, slightly trembling, was momentarily stopped by the white light.</p><p>At that moment, sword threads above the beast rapidly condensed, forming a gray blade in an instant, which fell lightly onto the beast's neck.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The beast, too late to gather white light again, had its head severed at the shoulders, falling to the ground while its body continued forward.</p><p>Instantly, the beast's head and body vanished, replaced by a new statue at the sword's edge, sitting motionless and showing no sign of further attack.</p><p>"So they're immortal, no wonder Hun Mo and the others didn't destroy the statues.  Good thing they don't continuously attack…"</p><p>Qin Sang realized, about to join Liuli in eliminating the other three beasts, when he sensed something, his eyes narrowed, quickly transmitting a message to Liuli.</p><p>Simultaneously, the sword formation shifted, converging the remaining three beasts.</p><p>Liuli paused, the blue light in her eyes intensifying, her Ice Soul Divine Light silently striking.</p><p>'Crack crack crack…'</p><p>The divine light simultaneously enveloped the three beasts.</p><p>The three beasts were instantly encased in a layer of translucent, rigid ice.</p><p>While Liuli restrained the three beasts, Qin Sang abruptly withdrew the sword formation, his phoenix wings unfurling as he transformed into a flash of lightning, instantly crossing the iron sword and dashing into the fog.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>A yellow light flashed, followed by a muffled sound.</p><p>Two figures separated after a brief clash.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared, looking at a yellow weasel in front of him, surprised. "Huang Mei?"</p><p>While he and Liuli dealt with the beasts, the Sky Eye Butterfly spotted something unusual in the deep fog, prompting Qin Sang's immediate intervention.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the observer turned out to be the Huang Mei Yao Wang.</p><p>Huang Mei's cultivation ranked among the highest in the entire demon realm.  It wasn't a subordinate of the Great Saint Tianpeng, but had merely gathered on Mount Tianpeng to plunder human territory.</p><p>It wasn't its duty to personally patrol.</p><p>Huang Mei's true form was a yellow weasel, small and mouse-like, with a tail twice the length of its body, covered in yellow fur.</p><p>This wasn't its true body.</p><p>The Yellow-browed Demon King’s birth imbued him with a primordial yellow energy.  He constantly refined this energy during cultivation, and this weasel was its manifestation.</p><p>He left the weasel to secretly observe the number and strength of any intruders, but Qin Sang was too astute. The weasel was spotted almost immediately, cornered in the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang sized up the weasel, sensing something unusual – it wasn't like a typical Yellow-browed Demon King's creation.  However, a lone weasel was a rare find; she couldn't let it escape.  </p><p>After a considerable time inside, Qin Sang remained baffled.  How did the Hun Mo and Tian Peng open the stone tablet space?  How much treasure had they already plundered?</p><p>The weasel’s eyes darted around; it tried to flee sideways.  Suddenly, darkness enveloped it.  Having witnessed Qin Sang's sword array, the weasel knew the Seven Souls Killing Array's power. Terror seized it; it let out a shriek, fur bristling.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The weasel vanished, a yellow flash speeding away from the array's reach.</p><p>“Fast, aren’t you?”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, bringing her fingers together and calmly manipulating the sword array.</p><p>In the direction the weasel fled, a shadowy figure materialized – her external avatar.  Expressionless and prepared, it raised its palms.  Cold air gathered, forming an ice八卦 mirror.  The mirror shone brightly, intercepting the weasel perfectly.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The mirror shattered, but the weasel was thrown back, disoriented. Before it could register its assailant, it crashed into something hard.  Terror struck; any attempt to flee was futile – it was trapped within the sword array.</p><p>Having struck, the avatar didn't linger. It returned to assist Liuli in killing the beasts.</p><p>Inside the array, the weasel thrashed.</p><p>“Answer a few questions, and your life will be spared,” Qin Sang stated.</p><p>Soul-searching Yuan Ying cultivators and transformed demon kings is difficult; it usually yields only fragmented information. This is why Qin Sang had sealed the Yin Dianzhu’s Yuan Ying instead of immediately extracting its memories.</p><p>“Squeak, squeak…”</p><p>The weasel screamed and clawed, responding with frantic sounds.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted and gestured with her Jin Chen sword.  </p><p>Sensing the array’s terrifying power, the weasel shrieked – a piercing, earsplitting sound. Its form flickered, splitting into countless illusory figures that scattered in every direction.</p><p>‘Pff! Pff!’</p><p>The illusions were instantly cut down by the sword threads.  Simultaneously, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire crept closer.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The array and the fire struck, their combined assault stunning the weasel.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang finally noticed something amiss.</p><p>“Not the main body, nor an avatar…odd!”</p><p>Demonic bloodlines are diverse, their innate abilities varied and unique. The weasel created from the primordial yellow energy was convincingly lifelike in both appearance and aura.</p><p>‘Slap!’</p><p>Without resistance, the weasel was destroyed, dissolving into a puff of yellow smoke.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, sensing something was wrong.  The disappearance was too swift, too complete. Her consciousness swept across the array and its surroundings, finding nothing amiss.</p><p>A cold smile appeared on her face. She retracted the array, the Jin Chen sword leaping out. Its body spun, targeting a specific location; a flash of light, fleeting and deadly.</p><p>In the distance, the battlefield was rough, littered with rocks. In an inconspicuous crack, a single, fine hair lay quietly. It transformed into a faint wisp of yellow smoke, attempting escape.</p><p>A sword beam descended, striking with lightning speed, pinning it to the ground!</p><p>‘Pff!’</p><p>The smoke dissipated completely.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared overhead, glanced down, and retrieved her sword.</p><p>The weasel’s substitution technique was ingenious, but it didn't fool the Sky-Eye Butterfly. While killing the weasel would alert the Yellow-browed Demon King, letting it escape was unacceptable.</p><p>The Yellow-browed Demon King positioned the weasel near the iron sword – a clever tactic, difficult for intruders to avoid. Fortunately, it was eliminated, unable to send a warning; the Demon King likely still didn't know how many had entered.</p><p>Liuli and the avatar, having slain three more beasts, caught up.</p><p>…</p><p>Deep within the clouds, as the yellow smoke dispersed, the Yellow-browed Demon King's already pale face became even whiter.  He swayed, took a deep breath, turned, and glared behind him, murderous intent blazing. His unusual behavior caught Tian Peng’s attention.</p><p>“My primordial yellow energy…it’s been shattered!” The Demon King gritted his teeth.  This severe blow would require decades of cultivation to recover from.</p><p>Tian Peng’s expression was grave. “The Iron Sword Beast Array, though eroded by time, still holds power.  A sudden encounter would disrupt anyone. You hid the yellow energy far away, added layers of protection, yet even the chance to escape is gone. Seems Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu have finally arrived!”</p>
