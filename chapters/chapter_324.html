<h1>Chapter 317: Live Capture</h1><p>"Die!"</p><p>The scar-faced man glared at Qin Sang with fierce eyes. Qin Sang was too fast for him to escape. If he only thought about escaping, he would die even faster.</p><p>The scar-faced man understands this principle.</p><p>He decided to fight desperately!</p><p>The flying sword suddenly released a powerful sword aura and let out a deafening roar. Like a rainbow, it pierced straight at Qin Sang.</p><p>The incomparably sharp sword aura charged at him, but Qin Sang's expression didn't change. When he decided to lure the scar-faced man into chasing him, he had already considered this situation.</p><p>The ebony sword was his backup plan.</p><p>The ebony sword suddenly released its sword aura, which transformed into the Thousand Mechanisms Sword Formation. It instantly suppressed the swords of Yue and Dai, broke through the void, and swam back swiftly like a fish.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>With a clear sound, the ebony sword blocked the flying sword that pierced towards him in the nick of time.</p><p>In the process, Qin Sang didn't stop at all.</p><p>Seeing that his flying sword was blocked, Qin Sang was already very close. The scar-faced man finally panicked. Facing Qin Sang's speed, he didn't have a chance to offer any resistance with a magic artifact. He could only hastily use several spirit talismans to force Qin Sang back.</p><p>For a while, spirit talismans flew about. There were violent flames, golden swords, and old vines. The place was bursting with various magic techniques.</p><p>Unfortunately, the power of these spirit talismans couldn't compare with the Thunderclap Talisman from before.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the Nine Dragons Heaven Chariot Talisman, and with a strong attitude, the spiritual power in his body surged. He endured the power of the spirit talismans and swung his arm. A ball of black poisonous mist flew out, easily enveloping the scar-faced man at such a close distance.</p><p>After being poisoned by the Heavenly Poison 紗, the scar-faced man's consciousness immediately became somewhat fuzzy. He suddenly shivered, and after waking up, he discovered that his spiritual power was also stuck. He was shocked.</p><p>At the same time, the scar-faced man's flying sword also had a moment of delay. Qin Sang seized the opportunity, urged the ebony sword to knock the flying sword away, and rushed into the poisonous mist.</p><p>The scar-faced man suddenly felt a chill in his chest. He looked down and saw a huge blood hole in his heart, with blood flowing out.</p><p>His gaze revealed deep disbelief as he died with his eyes wide open.</p><p>From when Qin Sang turned around to when he killed the scar-faced man, it was only a moment. Yue and Dai had just stabilized themselves, and were about to join the scar-faced man to surround Qin Sang, when they saw a scene that horrified them – the scar-faced man's body fell from the poisonous mist.</p><p>The scarlet blood was like a knife, stabbing into their eyes.</p><p>Their eyes bulged, and they exchanged a glance before turning around and fleeing without any hesitation.</p><p>After dealing with the most difficult enemy, Qin Sang's mind finally relaxed a little. However, it wasn't the time to relax yet. These three men, not even one could be allowed to escape!</p><p>The Yin Yang Compass flipped and pointed at the young man in the suit again, but this time it was with a white light.</p><p>The powerful suction force made the young man feel like he was sinking into a quagmire. He hastily activated the Seven Colored Umbrella. From the umbrella, colorful lights flew out like soft swords, cutting off the power of the Yin Yang Compass.</p><p>But Qin Sang was faster. Without waiting for him to break free from the Yin Yang Compass's suction force, he had already approached him.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang repeated his old tactic, and the Heavenly Poison 紗 rose again, covering the young man.</p><p>The young man had personally witnessed the death of the scar-faced man due to the Heavenly Poison 紗. He was filled with terror, and hurriedly raised the Seven Colored Umbrella to resist the Heavenly Poison 紗.</p><p>When the power of the two magic artifacts collided, the poisonous mist and the seven-colored light seemed to cancel each other out. In fact, Qin Sang's strength was greater than that of the young man, and the light of the Seven Colored Umbrella quickly dimmed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly put away the Heavenly Poison 紗, and the ebony sword took over. It took advantage of the moment when the light of the Seven Colored Umbrella dimmed, and pierced the Seven Colored Umbrella from an extremely tricky angle.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was also ambushed by Yue and Dai.</p><p>Qin Sang had the Nine Dragons Heaven Chariot Talisman, so there was no chance for Yue and Dai to escape. He also knew this in his heart, so when he saw Qin Sang fighting the young man, he immediately activated his octagonal bronze mirror.</p><p>A bronze-colored beam of light shot towards Qin Sang's back like lightning.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang was like a person with eyes on the back of his head. As soon as Yue and Dai attacked, the Nine Dragons Heaven Chariot Talisman brought him out of the way.</p><p>The power of the bronze mirror was fast, but it could only hit an afterimage.</p><p>Yue and Dai's faces turned ashen. The difference in strength was secondary. The key was that Qin Sang's speed was too despairing.</p><p>Seeing that the Ebony Sword was about to behead the young man in a short coat, Qin Sang suddenly had a change of heart, and at the last moment titled the Ebony Sword, avoiding the young man in a short coat's vital points, and piercing through his right chest.</p><p>'Poof!'</p><p>The young man in a short coat let out a bloodcurdling scream, but his cries suddenly came to an abrupt end, because the Sky Poison 紗 reappeared, and the poisonous mist took advantage of the opportunity to break through the Seven-Colored Luo Umbrella's obstruction.</p><p>Corroded by the poisonous mist, the young man in a short coat's body suddenly went rigid, and Qin Sang disappeared, darted in front of him, tapped his fingers repeatedly, quickly casting several restrictions to seal off his Qi Sea and meridians, capturing him alive.</p><p>Qin Sang held the young man in a short coat by the back of his neck, and temporarily threw him on the ground, turned around and watched Yu Daiyue's desperate fleeing figure, and immediately gave chase.</p><p>Without the need to activate the Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman, Qin Sang's speed was still faster than Yu Daiyue's.</p><p>The distance between the two was quickly closing, and just when Qin Sang was about to catch up to Yu Daiyue, Yu Daiyue suddenly turned around, waving his arm rapidly, throwing out a myriad of spirit talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, and his figure abruptly stopped, easily dodging Yu Daiyue's attacks, and then chased after him again.</p><p>At this time, one of Yu Daiyue's companions had been killed, and the other captured alive. Qin Sang had no need to be anxious or take risks anymore, and could toy with Yu Daiyue, exhausting him of all his resources.</p><p>Yu Daiyue was also a ruthless man, with magical artifacts destroyed by Qin Sang one after another, his spiritual power almost exhausted, yet he still couldn't harm Qin Sang. He had almost used up all his assets, but he had never uttered a single word of begging for mercy or repentance.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of勸降 either.</p><p>Apart from what Yu Daiyue said in the beginning, the two brothers did not exchange a single word.</p><p>In the end, Yu Daiyue's Qi Sea sent out waves of severe pain, but he still gritted his teeth and persevered. He reached for his mustard seed pouch again, and his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>It was... empty!</p><p>Yu Daiyue smiled miserably, and with his right palm, he condensed the only remaining trace of spiritual power he had left, and struck it hard against his own glabella.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, who had held back all his strength, activated the Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman once again, and grabbed Yu Daiyue's arm with one hand. With his left hand, he lightly chopped the back of his head, knocking him unconscious, and sealed off his Qi Sea as well.</p><p>Having captured Yu Daiyue alive, Qin Sang glanced in the direction of Changyang Market, wondering if anyone had sensed the battle here, but this was no place to stay for long.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang immediately returned to the battlefield just now, erased some of the more obvious auras, then grabbed the bodies of the young man in a short coat and the scarred man and left.</p><p>Before long, several遁光 came rushing from Changyang Market, arriving one after another, hovering in the air for a while, then dispersing.</p><p>This place once again returned to dead silence.</p><p>On the other side, Qin Sang carried the two living men, and flew straight out of the stone hills, entering a vast desert. After confirming that no one was following him, he sank into the sand and opened up a sand cave.</p>
