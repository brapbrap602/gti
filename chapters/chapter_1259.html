<h1>Chapter 1251: The Black Tower Array</h1><p>“Where is Ye Laomo?”</p><p>Everyone was surprised.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun pointed at the blood gate and repeatedly said, “We arrived too late. Ye Laomo has already broken through.  Moments ago, there were energy fluctuations from beyond the gate, indicating Ye Laomo was disabling the ancient seals. Then the fluctuations ceased suddenly. We don't know if they succeeded. We must act quickly! Fellow cultivators, assist me!”</p><p>Everyone was startled and quickly sat in a circle around Tongyou Mojun, combining their power to attack the blood gate.</p><p>The blood gate looked dilapidated; it shook violently with each attack, yet it proved exceptionally strong.</p><p>Runes flickered on the gate. These runes were incomplete yet, even under attack, they absorbed and dissipated most of the force. Less than 10% of the attacks actually struck the gate.</p><p>If the ancient seals were intact, even a combined force of cultivators from all three realms wouldn't stand a chance of breaking through.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun had been probing the gate, gaining some understanding of its restrictions. Qin Sang offered timely suggestions. After some exploration, they found its weakest point and attacked it in rotation.</p><p>While they assaulted the gate, it remained strangely quiet beyond, leaving everyone anxious about Ye Laomo's actions.</p><p>However, the area beyond the gate was filled with tall, mysterious towers, unlike anywhere else. It was clearly significant and couldn't be left for the Abyss alone.</p><p>Even if they couldn't stop Ye Laomo, gaining some spoils and a share of the bounty would make the journey worthwhile.</p><p>Everyone had different motivations but attacked the blood gate with all their might.</p><p>Qin Sang wielded the Ebony Sword, splitting it into countless beams of sword light that cascaded down like a silver river, relentlessly bombarding the gate. The sight was breathtaking.</p><p>Those present had heard of the Bright Moon Demon King's exceptional swordsmanship.  Seeing it firsthand confirmed their knowledge.  Even some sword-wielding Yuan Ying cultivators from the Small Cold Realm were left far behind.</p><p>Qin Sang's sword intent stemmed from the Way of Slaughter yet encompassed all things.</p><p>This swordsmanship was unprecedented; they had never seen or heard of its like. They wondered who taught the Demon King.</p><p>Unaware of their thoughts, Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye, peering through the cracks in the blood gate to assess the scene beyond.</p><p>The blood mist was thick as paste.</p><p>Black towers seemed to be submerged in a sea of blood.</p><p>Within this sealed blood lake, all other things had been assimilated and transformed by countless years of blood mist erosion, turning blood red.</p><p>But the black towers, made of an unknown material, remained jet black, standing out sharply.</p><p>Each tower was a thousand zhang tall, built from square, long stones.  Their rough surfaces, whether due to a divine concealment or unusual material, showed no glowing runes or manifestations of blood lightning or dark winds.</p><p>The dark spots they saw from the outside must have been the tower peaks.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered the towers' purpose, a cheer erupted. The blood gate, after a violent tremor, slowly opened a crack.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun dashed to the opening.</p><p>Confirming there were no ambushes, everyone filed in.</p><p>Surrounded by the black towers, they felt incredibly insignificant, their hearts filled with awe.  They then used their abilities to search for Ye Laomo and the others, but found nothing.</p><p>The place seemed peaceful, the blood mist still. It appeared untouched.</p><p>Qin Sang observed silently, finding no trace of the ancient seals. The area felt safer than elsewhere.</p><p>“Ye Laomo and the others must have entered one of the black towers…”</p><p>Tongyou Mojun said gravely.</p><p>Exchanging glances, the group chose a nearby tower and prepared to enter.  But as they moved, several gasps echoed.</p><p>Those who tried to fly, barely three zhang into the air, were forced down by an unseen pressure, nearly tumbling to the ground.</p><p>Thanks to their high cultivation and quick reflexes, they avoided a humiliating fall.</p><p>“There are restrictions we can’t detect…”</p><p>They were forced to remain on the ground.  As this thought crossed their minds, another unexpected event occurred!</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>A violent wind sprang up from the ground, and a wave of blood mist surged towards them.</p><p>Everyone cried out in alarm, hastily deploying their treasures to protect themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his sword light, the Ebony Sword hovering above his head.</p><p>Just as he finished preparing, Qin Sang's vision shifted wildly, followed by a dizzying spin. When he regained his senses, he discovered, to his astonishment, that Qing Jun and the others had vanished.</p><p>He found himself amidst a sea of blood, with the silhouettes of the black towers clearly visible.</p><p>Although they looked within reach, they were actually infinitely distant. Each step he took forward, the towers receded, always remaining out of reach.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately understood: they had unknowingly fallen into a large formation, a trap formed by the black towers.</p><p>The methods of ancient cultivators were truly profound and unpredictable. The formation was cleverly concealed, leaving them completely unaware until it was too late.</p><p>Despite being trapped in this mysterious formation, Qin Sang remained calm and collected, showing no signs of panic.</p><p>Since entering the Blood Gate, he had noticed that the black towers, like the Gate itself, were dilapidated; many were half-collapsed.  </p><p>The damaged towers meant the formation's power was significantly weakened, riddled with flaws.  If Ye Laomo could handle it, surely they could as well.</p><p>Qin Sang calmed himself, carefully observing the formation. He soon identified several weaknesses, easing his worries.</p><p>The only problem was that finding Ye Laomo and the others within the formation would be much more difficult.</p><p>He took out a sword talisman.</p><p>They had prepared various contingency plans for unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>The method for creating these talismans came from an ancient relic found in the battlefield of the immortals.  Their creation required many rare materials, making them extremely expensive and rarely crafted.</p><p>The sword case was in the possession of the Lord of Gloom, and whoever held the sword could sense his location and move toward him.</p><p>This flawed formation couldn't block the talisman's sensing abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to activate the talisman when he paused, stopping his incantation and releasing Fat Chicken.</p><p>Upon seeing the formation, Fat Chicken was startled, instinctively huddling close to Qin Sang. Even in its weakened state, the formation could easily trap it.</p><p>"Try the Thunder Bead," Qin Sang sighed. "This is the heart of the Blood Lake. If your mother isn't here..."</p><p>This place was sealed by the Blood Gate.  The group had barely managed to open a small crack.  The Thunder Falcon King had almost no chance of entering alone.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Fat Chicken, filled with apprehension, silently prayed as it summoned the Thunder Bead.  Its eyes were closed as it muttered an incantation.</p><p>The bead hovered above its head, slowly rotating. As Fat Chicken channeled its magic, a faint white light flickered on the bead. Initially weak, it grew steadily brighter, eventually forming a fist-sized orb.</p><p>Within the orb, thin strands of lightning crackled.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Since entering the Blood Lake, Fat Chicken had tried countless times, but this was the first time the Thunder Bead had reacted like this!</p>
