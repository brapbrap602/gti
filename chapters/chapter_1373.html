<h1>Chapter 1365  The Ghost Mother</h1><p>Chapter 1365  The Ghost Mother</p><p>The disciples took care of everything without Qin Sang needing to give instructions.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang in seemingly good spirits, Bai Hanqiu's anxious heart settled.</p><p>Breaking through to mid-Yuan Ying stage after only over thirty years of seclusion was indeed cause for celebration.</p><p>Each minor realm within the Yuan Ying stage presented a significant challenge.</p><p>Qin Sang initially estimated that this breakthrough would take anywhere from several decades to a century of seclusion, considering it a success even to reach the bottleneck.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the cultivation process went exceptionally smoothly.</p><p>The soul shadow within the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet was a tremendous help.</p><p>Qin Sang spent eighteen years refining two Corpse Flower Blood Jades, then cultivated for another five years, pushing his cultivation to the peak of early Yuan Ying stage, before consolidating his foundation and attempting the breakthrough.</p><p>In just twelve years, Qin Sang felt the breakthrough imminent and successfully advanced!</p><p>Even Qin Sang was somewhat incredulous at the moment of breakthrough.</p><p>From the day of his Golden Core breakthrough, it had been less than eighty years!</p><p>The cultivation world never lacked for prodigies, but according to various legends, achieving mid-Yuan Ying stage within one tribulation period—three hundred years after Golden Core—was already an extraordinary accomplishment.</p><p>And he had done it in less than a hundred years!</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang did not become complacent.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he was hardly a prodigy.  This astonishing achievement was entirely due to the Corpse Flower Blood Jades and the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet.</p><p>With the Corpse Flower Blood Jades depleted and the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet unable to provide further assistance, this rapid advancement was not repeatable.  He would have to proceed step by step on his own.</p><p>The late Yuan Ying stage remained distant.</p><p>“Master Uncle!”</p><p>At this moment, Tan Yi'en and the white cat finally caught up, panting as they approached and cautiously asked, “Master Uncle, have you… broken through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage…?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded slightly.</p><p>“Congratulations, Master Uncle, on your further advancement on the Dao!”</p><p>Tan Yi'en exclaimed joyfully.</p><p>…</p><p>The disciples suggested holding another grand ceremony, believing Qin Sang would then be unrivaled in the Northern Star Alliance.</p><p>But Qin Sang rejected the idea.</p><p>After inquiring about the sect's current situation, Qin Sang offered a few words of encouragement to his disciples before departing from the Green Sheep Temple alone, heading south.</p><p>Several months had passed since Mei Gu sent word.</p><p>Li Yu Fu had personally gone to investigate, but neither had sent any further news, leaving their safety uncertain.</p><p>Tan Hao was not only Qin Sang's old friend but also crucial to the possibility of the Mute Woman's awakening. He had to go himself.</p><p>However, Tan Hao's location was unusual—a small island at the southern end of the Northern Star Alliance.</p><p>Further south lay the storm belt.</p><p>Beyond the storm belt lay the three northern sea realms, outside the Northern Star Territory.</p><p>He flew at full speed.</p><p>Qin Sang made almost no stops, visiting no friends along the way. He traversed the Cloud Cang Great Marsh, soared over the Skywalking Plateau, and sped across the vast desert.</p><p>The Northern Star Great Desert was so vast that the combined area of all other territories paled in comparison.</p><p>This journey was almost a complete traversal of the Northern Star Territory!</p><p>Reaching the southern edge of the Northern Star Great Desert, oases became more frequent closer to the sea, and human settlements grew denser. This area had been a prime target for the Abyssal invasion, but after decades, the scars had healed, replaced by thriving life.</p><p>The desert landscape differed greatly from other territories.</p><p>Qin Sang was not interested in observing the alien scenery and went straight out to sea.</p><p>The sea was calm.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had found a cultivator's market and gathered some information.</p><p>The distance to the storm belt was considerable, so the sea storms were negligible close to shore, and there were no ferocious demonic beasts. Furthermore, this sea area differed from the Cang Lang Sea; the islands were sparse, concentrated in the near-shore waters, and mostly lacking in spiritual energy.</p><p>Especially near the storm belt, there was not a single island in sight.</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>The islanders were primarily mortals, requiring no cultivator's protection against storms and demonic beasts.</p><p>The island Mei Gu discovered was quite remote, near the southeastern edge of the archipelago.</p><p>Qin Sang made no attempt to conceal his flying, speeding towards the southeast.</p><p>He encountered no obstructions.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang reached the island. To be safe, he didn't land directly but found a nearby reef and activated the Green Sheep Temple's communication artifact.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Two figures flew in from afar—Mei Gu and Li Yu Fu.</p><p>“Greetings, Master Uncle!”</p><p>“Greetings, Master!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the two showed joy and bowed.</p><p>Qin Sang checked their cultivation levels, nodding in satisfaction. "Excellent! It seems you haven't been idle. Mei Gu, is this the island you mentioned?"</p><p>On the horizon, a small island shimmered faintly through the waves.</p><p>From Qin Sang's vantage point, some features were visible even from a distance.  The island seemed unremarkable, lacking even a town; just a single village of ordinary people. A large forest covered nearly ninety percent of the island, lush and green, but with very thin spiritual energy. A cultivator wouldn't choose such a place to establish a cave abode, unless the island concealed a powerful illusion array.</p><p>"Master, this is the place," Mei Gu reported dutifully. "While traveling through the desert, I learned of an ancient cultivator's abode.  My investigation led me to this sea area, and I discovered this island while passing by the village…"</p><p>Li Yu Fu added, "My junior sister and I did not dare to act rashly. We've been observing secretly for months, and haven't seen any cultivators coming or going from the island."</p><p>...</p><p>After hearing their account, Qin Sang pondered for a moment before flying towards the island with them.</p><p>The village held over a thousand households, with smoke curling from countless chimneys.  The three cultivators used a concealment spell to avoid disturbing the villagers.</p><p>Mei Gu guided Qin Sang to the deepest courtyard in the village—the ancestral shrine.</p><p>"This is it…" she whispered, casting a wary glance around before entering.</p><p>The shrine held ancestral tablets, constantly burning with incense.  In the center, however, was an exquisite wooden carving of a man. Though the craftsmanship wasn't as refined as that of Senior Sister Qing Jun, it was meticulously done, revealing the carver's deep respect.  The face was clearly visible: Tan Hao!</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, staring at the carving. Its position was unique—the surrounding memorial tablets were spaced apart, with only a tablet inscribed 'Ghost Mother' placed before it.  However, the carving itself lacked any inscription, making his identity uncertain. If it weren't for the fact that no one in the village shared the surname Tan, Qin Sang might have assumed Tan Hao had started a family there.</p><p>Mei Gu continued, "After discovering the carving, I found the oldest villager, the head of the clan, and used a hypnotic technique to learn the story. Over a hundred years ago, monstrous creatures terrorized the sea, threatening the villagers.  At the critical moment, the person depicted in the carving suddenly appeared and saved the entire village.  He was clearly a cultivator, though his cultivation level is difficult to ascertain. The survivors, deeply grateful, worship him as a savior. However, he didn't reveal his name, disappearing after slaying the monsters. He only claimed to be acting under the orders of the 'Ghost Mother'!"</p>
