<h1>Chapter 1157: The Beast King Banner</h1><p>Chapter 1157: The Beast King Banner</p><p>Chapter 8 of the *Cultivating the Nascent Soul Sword*.</p><p>Reaching this stage allows one to comprehend the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>With the Nascent Soul realm, one can re-experience the intricacies of the cultivation technique to truly understand its mysteries.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a meditative state, comprehending the technique. His gaze first fell upon the Seven Souls Killing Formation, a method for engaging enemies.</p><p>Having already grasped the sword intent and laid a solid foundation, he quickly understood the essence of the Seven Souls Killing Formation and successfully deployed it.</p><p>However, this formation felt like an empty shell, more akin to the sword formations Qin Sang had previously devised.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation is incredibly profound. The degree to which the sword soul, killing talismans, and seven souls are integrated affects the formation's power.</p><p>It seems that fully unleashing the power of the Seven Souls Killing Formation will take some time. For now, it can only serve as a standard combat technique; his greatest trump card remains the demonic banner.</p><p>Setting aside the Seven Souls Killing Formation for the time being, Qin Sang began practicing the cultivation technique.</p><p>He had already memorized the scriptures, but previously, his cultivation was insufficient, making them seem obscure and difficult.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, he finally managed to make progress.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang opened his eyes and fell into thought.</p><p>"Projecting the killing talismans into the sword soul…"</p><p>A troubled expression crossed his face; he felt clueless. After some thought, he summoned the ebony sword and one of its sword souls, mentally linking it to the first killing talisman.</p><p>He imagined the killing talisman as real and substantial, merging himself with it, drawing on its power to condense a phantom of the talisman and integrate it into the sword soul.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The sword soul suddenly shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, realizing that the sword soul was not a physical entity but, like other sword lights, an illusion, albeit one infused with his soul's essence.</p><p>How could such sword light carry the power of the killing talismans and remain undissipated?</p><p>Unexpectedly, the first step of the technique proved the most challenging.</p><p>Qin Sang steadied himself, not discouraged. He recondensed the sword soul, diligently studying the scriptures while experimenting.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed an intrusion into his cave's restrictions.  A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed it was Elder Xun, whom he had met before.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang rose and left the cave.</p><p>"Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Elder Xun was quite polite to Qin Sang.</p><p>This was not solely due to Qing Jun.</p><p>While Qin Sang didn't want to reveal his Nascent Soul cultivation, he wasn't trying to be overly low-key either; his outwardly displayed cultivation was clearly at the peak of the Golden Core stage.</p><p>"Elder Xun, please come in!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, inviting Elder Xun inside.  He said kindly, "My return to the mountain with the Sect Master was rushed last time; I wasn't able to visit all my fellow Daoists. Please forgive me, Elder Xun."</p><p>"Not at all, not at all."</p><p>Elder Xun repeatedly waved his hands, making no mention of Qin Sang's origins.</p><p>"I only learned of Daoist Qin's return from my disciples. Before the Sect Master left, he entrusted me with managing the sect's affairs. Is there anything you require, Daoist Qin? Perhaps we can have the disciples prepare in advance?"</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude. "No need to trouble Elder Xun.  During my travels, I had some insights, and I wish to cultivate quietly upon my return. I might want to browse the sect's collection of ancient texts…"</p><p>Even now, Qin Sang couldn't fully grasp how his senior sister Qing Jun would handle the Yuan Shen Sect in the future.</p><p>The Yuan Shen Sect, cultivated over generations, possessed deep foundations.</p><p>If the Qing Yang Sect could annex the Yuan Shen Sect, it could effortlessly establish itself as a top-tier sect.</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, then was quickly suppressed.  There was no need to rush the establishment of the Qing Yang Sect. He could ask his senior sister Qing Jun for her thoughts when the opportunity arose.</p><p>The two exchanged pleasantries.</p><p>Elder Xun led Qin Sang to the place where the ancient texts were stored. They conversed amicably along the way, and Qin Sang learned some news from the front lines from Elder Xun.</p><p>After seeing off Elder Xun, Qin Sang eagerly examined the ancient texts, including the Yuan Shen Sect's most precious collection of spiritual array scriptures, gaining significantly from it.</p><p>Thereafter, he remained at the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Qin Sang finally successfully projected the phantom of the first killing talisman onto a sword soul.</p><p>Inside the sword soul, the phantom of the killing talisman flickered faintly, though somewhat blurry, it didn't collapse as before.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long sigh of relief. This had cost him immense effort, but he had finally succeeded.</p><p>There was no need to rush the rest; he just needed to continue refining the sword souls, methodically projecting all seven killing talismans before attempting to integrate the seven souls.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the sword soul and turned his attention to other matters.</p><p>First, he took out the nine-life Xuanwu tortoise shell.</p><p>Ideally, this tortoise shell should be refined into a defensive treasure.</p><p>But Qin Sang had other uses in mind.</p><p>At the same time, he also took out the green copper piece.</p><p>He kept these two treasures together for a reason. The power within the tortoise shell perfectly counters fire, perhaps working with the green copper piece to subdue the South Ming Li Fire.</p><p>This is still Qin Sang's initial idea, and these two treasures alone might not be enough.</p><p>But before that, he certainly can't casually refine the tortoise shell.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, his fingertips dancing as he cast some simple restrictions on the surface of the tortoise shell. The shell is strong enough; he'll use it as a shield.</p><p>After dealing with the tortoise shell, Qin Sang took out the star conch.</p><p>After testing its power, Qin Sang shook his head. This treasure has a limit to the amount of true energy it can absorb, and it can only be used once against an enemy. It's not very useful at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The same applies to the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring and the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>These treasures, which earned him great merit during the Core Formation stage, are now outdated.</p><p>On the other hand, his lightning control technique, with his improved cultivation, is becoming even more powerful, still a formidable magical skill.</p><p>"And these!"</p><p>Qin Sang pulled out some spirit banners.</p><p>These are the Beast King Banners he obtained after killing disciples of the Wu tribe's Black Snake Mountain.</p><p>At its peak, the Beast King Banner formation had eighty-one banners. If he could collect them all, and have Core Formation stage disciples operate them, their power would be considerable. He could leave them to Qingyang Temple as a legacy for the true disciples.</p><p>Even if Qingyang Temple doesn't have a Nascent Soul cultivator in the future, it won't decline too quickly.</p><p>He doesn't have enough Beast King Banners, but Qin Sang obtained the method for their creation.  There aren't enough demonic beasts in the Xiao Han region for him to collect souls and refine banners, but the Ancient Immortal Battlefield has plenty of cloud beasts.</p><p>Lately, he's been studying the Yuan Shen sect's collection, gaining some insights into array formations. He'll try modifying the Beast King Banners when he has time.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang organized his Qian Jun ring, going through his treasures one by one.</p><p>The last thing was the Demon Banners.</p><p>There are eighteen Demon Banners in total.</p><p>After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang can control twelve Demon Banners without relying on pills.</p><p>He's tried it; twelve is the limit; he can't control any more.</p><p>Back then, Kui Yin Old Ancestor only had ten, and yet he made a great name for himself.</p><p>An array of twelve Demon Banners has the power of a top-grade magic treasure. Qin Sang estimates that, combined with his other abilities, he could fight a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>At worst, he could escape using his escape techniques.</p><p>However, every Nascent Soul cultivator is formidable.  Unless necessary, Qin Sang won't provoke them.</p><p>"Cultivation can't be rushed. I should focus on the Fire Seed Golden Lotus. If I make progress, I might be able to control fifteen Demon Banners…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I went out for a walk on the weekend and got back late, so I only wrote one chapter. I'll add more later.</p><p>******</p>
