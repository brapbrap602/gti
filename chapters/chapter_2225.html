<h1>Chapter 2215: The Stone Platform of the Sacred Mountain</h1><p>When the Dharma body flew from the mountaintop, a scroll floated above its head.</p><p>The scroll itself was light as a feather, soft as water, its surface shimmering with mysterious characters, emitting a green aura.</p><p>This scroll was a gift from Master Ning. It concealed the energy fluctuations of both Qin Sang and the Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this place became the center of the storm. Qin Sang worried that it would attract the attention of powerful beings from the Yi people, so he activated the scroll's power in advance to avoid detection.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had no other choice but to trust Master Ning.  More and more Yi cultivators were gathering outside the illusory domain. In this situation, a great upheaval was inevitable.  Once chaos erupted, it would be devastating for this illusory domain, possibly destroying it completely!</p><p>If he didn't quickly absorb the mountain's essence, he might not have another chance.</p><p>The scroll's light enveloped Qin Sang's Dharma body like a thin veil, gently rippling.</p><p>He flew further and further, always vigilant.</p><p>If a powerful Yi being were to see through the scroll and try to seize the Daiyu Immortal Mountain, he would have no choice but to sacrifice the lesser to save the greater, surrendering the mountain. Fortunately, this didn't happen.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang's Dharma body was also guarding against the illusory domain's power.  Perhaps the jade Buddha was shielding him from its influence; he felt no abnormalities.</p><p>He flew over countless mountain peaks.  Qin Sang's Dharma body considered itself deep within the illusory domain. Looking around, the scenery was still lush and beautiful, no different from the edge of the domain.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's Dharma body's eyes flickered, and it stopped before a mountain.</p><p>This was the place where the Daiyu Immortal Mountain had sensed the presence of its essence!</p><p>This mountain was slightly taller than the surrounding peaks, but unremarkable in the wider illusory domain.  It was steep and covered with pines and cypresses. A striped tiger was patrolling its territory.</p><p>Other birds and beasts were noticeably scarce.  A half-eaten goat carcass lay on the rocks, the mountain wind carrying a stench of blood.</p><p>The mountain seemed ordinary; the Immortal Mountain's essence didn't appear to affect it.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body glanced around and spotted a stone cave between two cliffs on the mountainside.  It darted inside.</p><p>The cave was in disarray, littered with bones—clearly a tiger's den.  The interior was pitch black and unfathomably deep, but it grew narrower, gradually losing all signs of tiger activity.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body continued deeper, reaching the cave's end where it suddenly opened into a spacious cavern filled with oddly shaped stalactites.</p><p>'Drip!'</p><p>A drop of mineral water fell from above, its sound strikingly clear in the silent cavern.</p><p>A faint white mist hung in the cavern.  Qin Sang's Dharma body seemed to sense something, a look of surprise flashing in its eyes as it quickly flew past the stalactites toward the center of the cavern.</p><p>This cavern must have been located deep underground, even more expansive than the mountain above.</p><p>He saw a circular underground lake. It wasn't filled with water, but with a layer of mineral water and the condensed white mist—the surrounding mist must have emanated from here.</p><p>Astonishingly, the aura emanating from the lake was identical to the Immortal Mountain's essence Master Ning had described!</p><p>It was unbelievable that the Immortal Mountain's essence was accumulating here so openly!</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body hadn't detected any formations or barriers along the way. Yet, before entering the cavern, he had sensed nothing unusual.  It seemed the Immortal Mountain's essence could automatically gather in a specific location and wouldn't dissipate.</p><p>Finding the Immortal Mountain's essence so easily, Qin Sang carefully investigated to be sure, then a thought stirred in his mind, and the scroll above his head slowly rose and sank into the mountain.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The mountain silently changed, its interior almost completely hollowed out, leaving only a shell thick enough to contain the Daiyu Immortal Mountain. The scroll's power enveloped the entire mountain, isolating it.</p><p>The tiger outside remained oblivious, sound asleep.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's Dharma body summoned the Daiyu Immortal Mountain and guided it towards the lake above.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The mountain trembled slightly, and Qin Sang's Dharma body saw the lake's mist being drawn towards the mountain in a swirling vortex. As the mist touched the Daiyu Immortal Mountain, it immediately disappeared into the mountain, consumed.</p><p>The Daiyu Immortal Mountain, like someone starved for years, had finally found food, devouring it greedily.</p><p>The mist could be seen rising upwards, continuously drawn from the lake, while the Daiyu Immortal Mountain acted as a bottomless pit.</p><p>As the master of Mount Taiyu, Qin Sang's astral body sensed the mountain slowly recovering as a mysterious energy infused it.</p><p>Suddenly, the cave trembled.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Several stalactites broke, falling to the ground, startling Qin Sang's astral body.</p><p>He frowned, rapidly pointing with his fingers, controlling the speed at which Mount Taiyu absorbed the mountain's essence.  It seemed the essence was draining too quickly, affecting the surroundings.  If it destabilized the illusionary realm beyond the protective barrier, their presence would be exposed – a risk Ning Zhenren had warned him about.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed anomalies in Mount Taiyu itself.  Severely damaged and on the verge of collapse, it couldn't withstand aggressive treatment; pushing it too hard risked its complete destruction.</p><p>Qin Sang had to strike a balance. Through trial and error, the white mist flowing towards the mountain began to contract, eventually settling into a steady stream, like a silken ribbon connecting the mountain and the stone lake.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, rising to look at Mount Taiyu.  The stalactites and mist were both manifestations of the mountain's essence.  He didn't expect to restore Mount Taiyu to its former glory; absorbing this essence and restoring some of its splendor would suffice.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang's main body, sensing his astral body's predicament, felt relieved.</p><p>Seated atop a mountain, he scanned the distance, searching for the Chunqiu Gui, but the artifact had vanished without a trace.</p><p>"The Chunqiu Gui, the illusionary realm, the seed… what connects them? Could the seed Hong Tian seeks have grown from this realm and be related to the Chunqiu Gui?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, glancing at the realm's edge, where numerous Cultivators from the Yi people had gathered. Unlike Qin Sang and Liuli, they lacked understanding of the realm's rules and hesitated to enter, observing from afar.</p><p>They were wary not only of potential dangers but also of each other.  Ancestral heirlooms and talismans pointed to this place, ensuring an inevitable conflict.</p><p>This standoff couldn't last; soon someone would venture inside.</p><p>"I just hope it doesn't cause widespread chaos…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, thinking of Mount Taiyu absorbing the mountain's essence and the secluded Liuli.</p><p>Liuli had begun seclusion after establishing her cave to break through to the next realm.  Normally, a cultivator would spend decades or even centuries searching for the opportunity to ascend from the Divine Transformation to the Illusory Void stage, often failing. Liuli, however, had suppressed the breakthrough opportunity, delaying it until now. According to Ning Zhenren, her imminent breakthrough and the ensuing heavenly tribulation were unbelievable.</p><p>Yet, recalling his own ascent to the Illusory Void, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>The realm’s rules could be discerned through celestial phenomena.  Observing the heavens, Qin Sang began setting up protective arrays to prevent any disturbance during Liuli's tribulation.</p><p>As time passed, more Yi Cultivators gathered, eventually entering the illusionary realm in small groups.  Qin Sang's main body and astral body remained vigilant, while the barrier array protecting Liuli’s cave should buy her time.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang watched more cultivators arriving, a thunderous boom echoed from deep within the realm, instantly capturing everyone's attention.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang sprang up, activating his enhanced vision.  The realm's depths were trembling, vibrant clouds filling the sky.  Within these clouds, a shadow emerged.</p><p>As the shadow clarified, revealing its outline, everyone was astonished.</p><p>"It's…a mountain?"</p><p>"A mountain growing from the ground!"</p><p>…</p><p>The murmurs grew. The cloud-enshrouded peak towered above the surrounding mountains, still growing, its tremors shaking the landscape, causing birds and beasts to flee in panic.</p><p>"That must be the place our ancestors guided us to!"</p><p>"Right, let's go!  Don't let others get there first!"</p><p>"Be careful, there are storms outside, but here it's calm. Isn't that strange?"</p><p>…</p><p>Even within the two factions, there was no unity. Some rushed towards the mountain, while others waited, hoping others would lead the way.</p><p>Unexpected changes came so swiftly that Qin Sang couldn't help feeling nervous.  Her Dharma body quickly returned to the cave, relieved to find the mountain's spiritual energy unaffected.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>…</p><p>Streams of escaping light pierced the air, descending to the edge of the clouds.</p><p>The tremors hadn't ceased; the peak continued to grow, shrouded in thick clouds, its inner atmosphere chaotic and its features obscured.</p><p>Even the most impetuous individuals paused, deciding to wait for things to stabilize before proceeding.</p><p>Seeing no immediate danger, those outside gradually entered, gathering around the clouds, their gazes fixed on the growing peak.  Two distinct factions formed.</p><p>Unable to find the Chunqiu Gui, Zhan Yan returned to the Queen of the Jiao people, whispering urgently in her ear.  Various Daoist sects had explored this illusory realm for years; some had even entered, but this mountain had never appeared before.  Zhan Yan couldn't make sense of it.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>There was no dust or debris, only brilliantly colored clouds. The peak, veiled in these multicolored clouds, was mysterious and awe-inspiring, resembling a divine mountain.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's Dharma body left the cave, silently approaching. Her true body remained behind, protecting Liuli. The Da Yu Immortal Mountain could absorb spiritual energy on its own; she didn't need to maintain it constantly.  Qin Sang was also curious about the origin of this divine mountain. Could it be the legendary Yuanjiao Immortal Mountain?</p><p>"Master Qin."</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader and others arrived, paying their respects upon seeing Qin Sang.</p><p>Noticing it was only her Dharma body, and that her true form and Liuli were absent, they didn't inquire further, instead questioning the mountain's origins.</p><p>"I too am unaware of this mountain's origins. I only know that this is a very peculiar illusory realm, its mysteries yet unsolved…"</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted her knowledge to the others.</p><p>"Illusory realm?  Is everything around us an illusion?"</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader was shocked. They hadn't noticed a thing!</p><p>Everyone waited patiently, watching the divine mountain grow taller, gradually piercing the clouds, its imposing height standing out among the illusory realm's other features.</p><p>After an unknown time, as the clouds swirled, they finally glimpsed some of the mountain's features. It was devoid of vegetation, extremely steep, with sheer cliffs everywhere.</p><p>Between these cliffs were scattered platforms of varying heights, stretching from base to summit, seemingly representing some kind of hierarchy.</p><p>These platforms were remarkably similar in size and shape, arranged with careful irregularity and spacing; their formation couldn't be natural.</p><p>Upon seeing these platforms, the faces of the ancestors and disciples lit up – this was precisely what they had been searching for!</p><p>Meanwhile, the Feather-people prince and the Jiao people queen had gathered, producing a white paper crane.  The two groups of experts surrounded it.</p><p>The ancestors and disciples frowned, but even if they wanted to intervene, it was too late.</p><p>Moments later, a crane's cry echoed.  The paper crane came alive, spreading its wings and soaring towards the heavens.  Its wings ignited, like a moth to a flame, ultimately dissolving into a fiery spectacle, vanishing like fireworks.</p><p>Qin Sang, having some knowledge of the situation, felt a deep unease.</p><p>The two groups were contacting powerful beings outside the Heart Lake. The mountain would be the next battleground, and they would vie for positions on it!</p><p>It seemed the positions on the mountain would influence their final competition for the 'seeds'.</p><p>What changes the mountain would bring to the illusory realm remained to be seen…</p><p>Outside the Heart Lake.</p><p>Hong Tian felt something, abruptly opening his eyes.  At the same time, other Saint-level experts sensed the signals emanating from the Heart Lake.</p><p>"You all felt it, yes?"</p><p>The Jiao people queen spoke first.</p><p>A moment later, a hearty voice boomed: "The time is not yet right. Let's wait."</p><p>…</p><p>Within the illusory realm, after the two groups activated the paper crane, nothing changed. Everyone could only remain where they were, watching the mountain continue to grow.  Someone noticed that its growth had slowed.</p><p>…</p><p>"It's ready!"</p><p>The hearty voice echoed again.</p><p>Hong Tian's eyes flashed; he raised his right hand, a pale green hand-shadow shooting towards the sky. Several more hand-shadows appeared.  Where they converged, clusters of spiritual light floated in the void, containing treasures: not only spirit treasures and elixirs, but also objects of unknown purpose.</p><p>These were the final rewards of the sacred land trials.  Due to the upheaval of the sacred land, they remained unclaimed, gathered here.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>All the hand-shadows merged, forming a giant hand that gathered all the treasures and flew towards the Heart Lake.</p>
