<h1></h1><p>Outside the cloud wall.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators who had received the news gradually arrived.  Gazing at the cloud wall, the cultivators were eager to try their luck, but the reality was that they were forced to retreat repeatedly by the expanding cloud wall.  Those who dared to risk their lives and possessed the strength to break through the cloud wall were ultimately few in number. The scene within the ice wall was chaotic, with surging undercurrents. It was too dangerous!</p><p>“Old Devil Chou, what should we do? If we wait any longer, the most valuable treasures in the secret realm will definitely be plundered…”</p><p>Ancestor Queshan’s tone was somewhat anxious.</p><p>They had gathered their helpers and traveled together through the turbulent flow, never expecting another obstacle here.</p><p>Although the interior of the cloud wall was extremely chaotic, he estimated that as long as Nascent Soul cultivators were sufficiently cautious, they shouldn't easily perish within. However, Old Devil Chou was unwilling to take the risk.</p><p>He himself felt somewhat insecure due to his limited strength, and was also stopped outside.</p><p>Old Devil Chou said unhurriedly, “Some suspect this secret realm is the legacy of the Formless Immortal Sect, and I think it’s eight or nine parts out of ten correct.  What kind of person do you think has the ability to open the legacy? Even if you can enter, do you have the strength to compete with them for the most precious treasures within? Those fellows who just entered haven’t made any动静yet. Let’s wait a bit longer.”</p><p>“Those people’s cultivation is no less than ours. If they are all forced out, we can only wait for the cloud wall to dissipate…”</p><p>Ancestor Queshan sighed lightly.</p><p>The cloud qi and turbulent flow were mixed together. Some of the cultivators waiting outside the cloud wall gathered in twos and threes, inviting acquaintances to join forces, while others stayed alone in the distance, waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>Some formed groups and entered the cloud wall.</p><p>Soon, people continuously retreated from the cloud wall, their figures quite disheveled.  Some were even accidentally injured, making others even more hesitant to act rashly.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>The cloud wall showed no signs of weakening, but instead became increasingly violent, appearing even more dangerous.</p><p>Several figures hovered in a hidden location outside the crowd.</p><p>All of them were monks and nuns dressed in dark blue robes, without any makeup.</p><p>Some wore monk's hats, having taken tonsure, while others were lay practitioners with hair, wearing Miao Chang crowns, elegant and unadorned.</p><p>They had just arrived, observing for a while. The leading old nun’s brow faintly glowed with divine light, revealing a glistening jade stone, like a third eye opening.</p><p>The jade stone reflected the cloud wall, and images of the interior seemed to flash frequently within, mysteriously peering inside.</p><p>Suddenly, the jade stone vanished into the old nun's brow.</p><p>The old nun said in a solemn tone, “The collapse of the Mountain Guarding Cloud Dragon shouldn't be this violent.  The Formless Immortal Sect’s internal chaos has caused the grand formation to activate itself, and the combination of various factors has led to this anomaly. Before the cloud wall shows signs of weakening, entering from here will not be easy.”</p><p>“Is it truly the legendary Formless Immortal Sect?”</p><p>A young nun asked excitedly, “Didn’t Master-Aunt say that our Hidden Moon Convent has a deep connection with the Formless Immortal Sect? Is there no way to pass through the cloud wall?  The Formless Immortal Sect controlled the legendary Immortal Palace and unearthed countless supreme treasures. Even if we can't enter the Immortal Palace, obtaining treasures from the Formless Immortal Sect would be a tremendous opportunity!”</p><p>All the nuns looked at the old nun.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the old nun hesitated for a moment, then turned and flew towards the exit of the passage. The others were puzzled and quickly followed.</p><p>While flying, the old nun glanced sideways at a lay practitioner beside her and said, “Little Junior Sister, I didn’t tell you these things when I took you as a disciple on behalf of Master because the Formless Immortal Sect no longer exists, so it was meaningless.  Moreover, the cultivation world had completely eradicated the Formless Immortal Sect.  Although we are a secluded sect, we don’t want to expose our relationship with the Formless Immortal Sect and invite trouble.  Unexpectedly, the sect’s legacy would reappear in the world. It seems the Formless Immortal Sect’s inheritance hasn’t been broken.”</p><p>Although the lay practitioner wore dark blue robes and simple attire, with an unadorned face, her stunning beauty couldn't be concealed.</p><p>She nodded, clearly of a taciturn nature.</p><p>A middle-aged lay practitioner beside her interjected, “Not only does Junior Sister Liu Li not know, but we are also not very clear.  We are Buddhist cultivators, how are we related to the Formless Immortal Sect?”</p><p>“In the Central Plains cultivation world, especially the two Southern Barbarian states, tracing back to their roots, which sect dares to say they have no relationship with the Formless Immortal Sect?”</p><p>The old nun said with emotion, “The Formless Immortal Sect established the Five Phase Halls according to the common five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. But their inheritance wasn't limited to these five branches; it was diverse.  However, they didn’t establish separate branches, and all were generally categorized under the Five Phase Halls based on the five elements. This was just within the Formless Immortal Sect itself. The number of sects that once relied on the Formless Immortal Sect was even greater, including demonic and Buddhist sects. The Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and the Eight Scenery Pavilion also had deep connections with the Formless Immortal Sect.”</p><p>This was the first time the others had heard of these secrets.</p><p>“Our Hidden Moon Convent also once relied on the Formless Immortal Sect?”</p><p>The old nun nodded, “The connection between Hidden Moon Convent and the Formless Immortal Sect is even deeper than others. Our founding ancestor was the Dao Companion of a Nascent Soul elder of the Formless Immortal Sect.”</p><p>“A Nascent Soul Dao Companion!”</p><p>The young nun exclaimed, “Why did our ancestor become a nun?”</p><p>“After reaching Nascent Soul, there’s a chance for ascension, but the path to ascension is difficult. Even Nascent Soul cultivators struggle with life and death, and ascending with one’s entire household only exists in legends. Our ancestor failed several attempts to break through to the next realm, and her Dao Companion didn’t want to go alone.  However, our ancestor didn’t want to be an obstacle on her Dao Companion's path to immortality, so she forced her departure by threatening to end her own life. Her Dao Companion promised to guide her upon achieving greater cultivation, but both knew in their hearts that this departure meant separation between two realms, with no hope of reunion. After her Dao Companion left, our ancestor couldn't bear the pain of longing and couldn't stand to see the old scenes of the Formless Immortal Sect, so she retreated into Buddhism, founded the Hidden Moon Convent, and lived a life of solitary Buddhist practice…”</p><p>The old nun spoke slowly, her tone calm, but everyone could feel the deep affection between the ancestor and her Dao Companion.</p><p>Where in the world is there a perfect solution?</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators have moments of helplessness.</p><p>When they entered the Hidden Moon Convent and cultivated Buddhist Dharma, the primary goal was to achieve detachment and desirelessness. No wonder the sect had so many such methods.</p><p>It turned out that their ancestor had tasted the bitterness of longing and turned to Buddhist practice, unwilling for future generations to repeat her mistakes.</p><p>“Did our ancestor’s Dao Companion fail to fulfill her promise?” The young nun’s expression was downcast, sympathizing with her ancestor’s experience.</p><p>The old nun chanted a Buddhist mantra, “The world changes, and immortal sects rise and fall. For countless years, the number of Nascent Soul cultivators who ascended eastward is certainly not small, but we haven't heard of any who manifested from the upper realm to bless their old friends. Otherwise, how could the Formless Immortal Sect have fallen to such a state?”</p><p>As they spoke, they flew out of the turbulent passage and saw a tumultuous crowd outside, a vast sea of people.</p><p>Nearby cultivators, regardless of their cultivation level, had all gathered here.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were blocked outside the cloud wall, and those below Golden Core couldn't even enter the passage now, all waiting nearby, hoping for the passage to open wide.</p><p>Mount Taiyue was surging with people, this bustling for the first time.</p><p>The nuns flew secretly to the edge of the crowd. The old nun opened her palm, revealing a warm jade pendant, flickering faintly, the treasure she had retrieved from the pagoda.</p><p>“Because of our ancestor's relationship, the Formless Immortal Sect treated the Hidden Moon Convent differently.  We could directly teleport from the Hidden Moon Convent to the Formless Immortal Sect.  Back then, the demonic tribulation was devastating, causing the mountains and rivers of the Southern Border to shift, and the rivers to change course.  When the Formless Immortal Sect fell silent, our ancestors were also forced to abandon the old grounds of the convent and flee far away.  Later, after many searches, they couldn't find it, suspecting that the convent had been affected and had collapsed. This jade is a gift exchanged between our ancestor and her Dao Companion when they first met. It was later refined and used as a warning treasure. With the emergence of the Formless Immortal Sect, the jade is emitting a precious light again. Perhaps it can help us find the convent. Rather than risking entering the cloud wall, it's better to give it a try.”</p><p>She spoke as she closed her hand around the warm jade.</p><p>Using some unknown Daoist technique, the light of the warm jade pendant began to change rhythmically, but not very clearly.</p><p>The old nun frowned slightly and suddenly flew towards the eastern side of Mount Taiyue.</p><p>Even after flying out of Mount Taiyue, the old nun still didn't stop. The other nuns could only endure their curiosity and closely follow her.</p><p>“Ahead is Mount Que.”</p><p>The young nun looked into the distance and whispered.</p><p>She had traveled abroad and was familiar with the terrain of the Southern State.</p><p>Ancestor Queshan was guarding the cloud wall in the passage, so they didn’t need to worry about anything.</p><p>The old nun flew straight towards Mount Que.  Everyone was already prepared to force their way through Mount Que’s formation, but unexpectedly, the old nun suddenly changed direction and increased her speed!</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the nuns became confused. They saw the old nun's figure flashing repeatedly, flying around Mount Que, unsure if the jade had malfunctioned, or if the object they were searching for was moving at high speed.</p><p>Not long after, the old nun’s figure plummeted, falling straight into a deep ravine behind Mount Que, and shouted in a low voice, “Open!”</p><p>The jade left her hand.</p><p>It flew to the center of the ravine and stopped in mid-air.</p><p>The void trembled slightly, and suddenly a brilliant light burst forth.</p><p>The other nuns had already flown above the ravine, joining forces to conceal the phenomenon to avoid being discovered by outsiders.</p><p>“Found it!”</p><p>The old nun's joy was quickly replaced by shock. Behind the phenomenon, she saw the ruins of a dilapidated scene, long since lost to its former glory, with only a few crumbling old Buddhist halls remaining.</p><p>Besides the nuns of Hidden Moon Convent, there were mysterious figures in other places, searching for something, but most returned disappointed.</p><p>…</p><p>The edge of Mount Taiyue.</p><p>This place was full of towering peaks and rugged terrain, the most complex terrain in all of Mount Taiyue.</p><p>There was no shortage of perilous locations like poison pools and valleys of yin煞.</p><p>A wisp of black smoke suddenly emerged from a dark canyon, revealing two strange shadows that wriggled and transformed into human forms.</p><p>But these two were unusually tall, at least nine feet in height, and would certainly stand out in a crowd.</p><p>Of course, their appearance was even more striking.</p><p>One had gills similar to a fish, and a mouth that looked like a split on its face, stretching from its left ear to its right ear, exceptionally ugly.</p><p>The other had wings growing from its ribs, a long, pointed beak, and pure white feathers, each one as white as jade. A few feathers were slightly ruffled, and it subconsciously turned its head to preen them, only to find it couldn't reach.</p><p>“Hiss… That old nun's gaze was so sharp. We were hiding beneath the formation, and she almost saw through our disguise…”</p><p>The fish demon patted its chest, still feeling apprehensive.</p><p>The bird demon managed to extend its neck and used its beak to preen its feathers, retracting it with satisfaction, “I think that most beautiful little nun is even more powerful.  I’m afraid only the Great Sage himself could suppress her.”</p><p>The fish demon clicked its tongue, “Humans truly have hidden dragons and crouching tigers, and this is only the Southern Border.  No wonder the Sage King agreed to divide the land and rule.  There are more and more human experts. Green Hair Rat and Black Lion are far away in the Gold and Jade State and definitely won't make it in time.  The Great Sage ordered us to disperse to various locations; I wonder how many we can reach…  They’re no match for humans.”</p><p>“These nuns are a bit strange. They didn't enter the secret realm, but instead went the opposite direction.” The bird demon observed for a while, then flew high into the air to look around.</p><p>The fish demon mused, “The old nun seemed to have some kind of treasure in her hand.  The fluctuations exposed their traces; they must have other plans.  It’s a pity there are only the two of us. Otherwise, following them would definitely yield some gains.”</p><p>The bird demon turned its head towards the passage, “Let’s wait and see; maybe there will be a chance to fish in troubled waters.”</p><p>The fish demon scoffed, “Be careful not to lose your life in there. Human cultivators become like mad dogs when they see us! Didn’t those human cultivators we just caught say this might be the legacy of some ancient human sect?  There probably aren’t many treasures useful to us.  It’s best to honestly stay here and wait for the Great Sage’s decision.”</p><p>“I hope the Great Sage arrives soon.”</p><p>The two demons exchanged a few more words and quietly disappeared into the shadows.</p><p>…</p><p>“Ice Instrument Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body ascended the Asking Scripture Path, heading towards the Lang Huan Bell. His avatar flew for a while and arrived in front of the ice palace.</p><p>Only when he got closer did he realize the grandeur of the ice palace.</p><p>The real ice palace perfectly reflected the scene within the mysterious ice disk.  Inside, there were layered terraces and pavilions, displaying the full splendor of an immortal palace. In front of the entrance to the ice palace, there was a plaque that read: Ice Instrument Palace!</p><p>It was somewhat different from what he had expected.  There were no words related to the water phase.</p><p>But besides the water phase branch, what other place would require a palace of this scale?</p><p>Qin Sang felt it was eight or nine parts out of ten correct; he shouldn't have come to the wrong place.</p><p>His avatar glanced around, not seeing anyone approaching for the time being.  He walked to the gate of the Ice Instrument Palace and discovered it was ajar.  He pushed the gate open without any effort.</p><p>Although it was an ice palace, there was no biting chill.</p><p>A small lake came into view.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew, and a colorful lotus grew in the lake, in full bloom.</p><p>But this was the only bright spot in the desolation.</p><p>The water in the lake was almost dried up, and weeds were overgrown.</p><p>The avatar took out the mysterious ice disk, thought for a moment, then hid it in his sleeve, using a secret technique to lock the ice disk's aura.  He walked through the main gate and immediately noticed the broken railing around the lake.</p><p>Vines and withered grass covered it.</p><p>The avatar waved his hand, clearing away the covering, and looked closely.</p><p>Time had erased many traces, but some information could still be gleaned.</p><p>“A great battle took place here!”</p><p>Qin Sang concluded.</p><p>In the past, the chaos had actually spread here.  Enemies had attacked the Ice Instrument Palace, and the Formless Immortal Sect was at the brink of destruction.  No wonder they abandoned their sect and fled in all directions.</p><p>It was no longer possible to discern the divine abilities used by both sides from these traces.</p><p>The avatar raised his head and looked around, discovering many spiritual trees growing by the lake.  Some had survived and were considered rare even in the outside world.</p><p>But his goal was clearly not these.  He flashed to the top of a tree and saw three paths hidden in the forest. He casually chose the one on the left.</p><p>After walking for a while, the avatar returned the same way.</p><p>The end of this path should have been a place similar to a side hall, even more dilapidated than the lakeside.  Although the ancient halls hadn't collapsed, they were severely damaged and long empty.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he had been inside the ice palace for so long without encountering any restrictions as strong as those on the cliff, which was clearly not normal.</p><p>He didn't even have a chance to test the effectiveness of the mysterious ice disk.</p><p>“Could the Ice Instrument Palace have been completely destroyed?”  The avatar muttered to himself and then headed towards the right.</p><p>As expected, the right side hall was much the same.</p><p>He didn't waste any more time and returned directly, choosing the middle path and hurrying along.</p>
