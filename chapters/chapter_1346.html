<h1>Chapter 1338: A Swarm of Ghosts</h1><p>Chapter 1338: A Swarm of Ghosts</p><p>He took out a talisman-sword, a communication artifact.</p><p>After staying at Sword Scar Mountain for so long, the talisman-sword hadn't reacted.  It seemed they hadn't found Ye Laomo yet.</p><p>Most of the Nascent Soul cultivators probably weren't focused on Ye Laomo anymore.</p><p>The Ancient Medicine Garden had so many spirit herbs.</p><p>The Heavenly Mountain held countless ancient treasures.</p><p>And there were those unexplored secret realms…</p><p>Each was as attractive as Ye Laomo.</p><p>The reason they could still agree on dealing with Ye Laomo was twofold:  those tricked and plotted against by Ye Laomo wanted revenge; and Ye Laomo acted recklessly and cruelly, making everyone uneasy as long as he lived.</p><p>Also, the demonic creatures released by Ye Laomo were brewing some unknown conspiracy.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  His goal had been achieved; it didn't matter where he went next.</p><p>After leaving Sword Scar Mountain, Qin Sang planned to contact his senior sister and Bai first. If they didn't need his help, he would try his luck at the Ancient Medicine Garden.</p><p>He most looked forward to the Hanging Garden Palace.  While observing the phenomenon from afar, Qin Sang noticed a shimmering treasure light beneath the divine tree in the Hanging Garden Palace.  Having received personal instruction from Yunyouzi, his understanding of the Hanging Garden Palace far surpassed others. With good luck, he might obtain one or two immortal herbs.</p><p>Finding a top-tier immortal plant, one of the Ten Divine Trees, would be even better.</p><p>Traveling through the illusions, Qin Sang gradually sensed something amiss.  He collected his thoughts, looked around, and after observing for a while, finally noticed a difference from before.  The power of the ancient illusion array hadn't changed, but the illusions were becoming increasingly chaotic.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious, and he quickened his pace.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang burst out of the illusion array, only to be hit by a powerful force.</p><p>Qin Sang had been vigilant, and he summoned his ebony sword beforehand.  Realizing something was wrong, he quickly chanted the sword incantation, the sword light protecting his body and resisting the impact.</p><p>His body, like catkins, drifted far away.</p><p>After absorbing the impact, Qin Sang discovered the force was actually a gust of wind.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Gusts of gale-force winds blew.</p><p>Qin Sang flew on his sword through the gale, and seeing the world around him, realized that in the time he had been inside, earth-shattering changes had taken place.</p><p>The wind howled across the heavens and earth, a scene of colorful splendor, because the gale was infused with colorful auspicious clouds, transforming into five-colored immortal winds.</p><p>Purple Micro Palace was more chaotic than before.  The five-colored immortal winds swept across all directions, rumbling with a series of earth-shattering booms; the distant scenery was hazy.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt the talisman-sword in his palm vibrate. He loosened his grip, and the talisman-sword spun, hovering before him.</p><p>The sword tip pointed towards the outer hall!</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly.</p><p>It seemed his senior sister and the others had been contacting him.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards Sword Scar Mountain.  In the past, the illusion array couldn't block internal and external perception, but now the true power of the array was evident – the talisman-sword's perception was blocked!</p><p>"I wonder when they sent the message. Bai didn't come looking for me.  Perhaps the situation isn't urgent, or perhaps the situation is too dangerous for them to spare themselves."</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the direction of the sword tip, only to see the sky-obscuring five-colored divine wind. He couldn't tell what had happened there.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the incident seemed to have occurred in the outer hall.</p><p>When they entered through the demonic cave, everyone's attention was drawn to the unusual phenomena in the inner hall.  Everyone naturally assumed that Ye Laomo's target was also the secret realm within the inner hall.</p><p>Few people paid attention to the outer hall.</p><p>Qin Sang only glanced at it briefly.</p><p>He remembered the outer hall wasn't as full of strange phenomena as the inner hall.  The most striking feature was the Immortal Tomb, where the ghostly energy was overwhelming, but it was most likely influenced by the inner hall.</p><p>Besides that, there didn't seem to be anything noteworthy.</p><p>The outer and inner halls of Purple Micro Palace were not integrated. The inner hall was like a fairyland, while the outer hall was either an Immortal Tomb or a blood-colored sacrificial altar.  Originally, there was an immortal array separating the two places, but it had been destroyed in recent years.</p><p>The outer hall held little appeal for Nascent Soul cultivators. What could Ye Laomo be doing in the outer hall?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced. He glanced again at the Hanging Garden Palace.</p><p>The unusual phenomena in the inner hall were intensifying.  First, the dormant immortal prohibitions were activated, then the five-colored immortal wind appeared, and who knew what would happen next.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a vague sense of unease.</p><p>If the unusual phenomena continued, staying in the inner hall could be dangerous.  At this moment, rashly entering the Ancient Medicine Garden and challenging the ancient prohibitions of the Hanging Garden Palace wasn't a wise choice.  Even without any movement from the talisman-sword, Qin Sang decided to leave the inner hall first, observe, and then make a decision.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang no longer hesitated. He activated his spirit sword for protection and returned to the outer hall by the same route.</p><p>The multicolored celestial wind intensified, the sky resembling a wildly painted canvas.</p><p>Visibility was severely limited.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see the situation at the inner sanctuary, unsure how many had already reached the outer hall, or how many ignored the magic swords, continuing their treasure hunt.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived near the Sword Path Hall.</p><p>The scene was utterly unrecognizable, far more shocking than anything Qin Sang remembered!</p><p>Numerous towering peaks rose from the ground.</p><p>Hundreds of colossal mountains surrounded the Sword Path Hall, each incredibly steep, forming a massive, awe-inspiring sword array.</p><p>Between the peaks, white light shone, ancient restrictions forming platforms, seemingly training grounds for disciples.</p><p>The Sword Path Hall lay at the very center.</p><p>Most peaks were damaged; some were severed, others reduced to mere foundations, some even collapsing, shattered peaks crashing to the earth.</p><p>Ancient restrictions glowed atop the mountains, ancient halls appearing and disappearing amidst the multicolored celestial wind, including the mountain holding the Sword Path Hall.</p><p>These halls exuded an ancient, desolate aura.</p><p>Most were ruined and dilapidated, showcasing the decline of the ancient immortal palace.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Sword Path Hall.</p><p>A solitary peak stood out.</p><p>The cliff faced east, seemingly unchanged.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt apprehensive; he wasn't sure he could navigate the dense ancient restrictions and reach the summit.  But now was clearly not the time to test it.  Qin Sang lowered his head, averting his gaze.</p><p>Passing through the peaks, he reached the ancient medicinal garden.</p><p>The glow of the exceptional immortal herbs was even brighter.</p><p>Qin Sang also saw the occasional flash of magical treasures within the garden, proving some still risked searching for herbs.</p><p>He shook his head, ignoring others, his pace unwavering.</p><p>Along the way, the power of the multicolored celestial wind intensified.  If this continued, or new phenomena emerged, leaving might prove impossible.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reached the edge of the inner hall.</p><p>The scene was chaotic; land fragments ripped from the inner hall were devastated from the outermost layers. The area where the outer and inner halls met was ravaged by deep fissures and collapses.</p><p>Even more astonishing,</p><p>The ghostly mist was no longer confined to the immortal tomb's area; it had erupted, shrouding almost the entire outer hall.</p><p>Evil spirits howled, a horde of ghosts rampaged.
