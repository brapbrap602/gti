<h1>Chapter 1779: Great Change</h1><p>Chapter 1779: Great Change</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Jiu Ming Xuan Gui warned.</p><p>The seal here and the seal on the stone gate originated from the same source, forming a single entity.  The Jiao Dragon King slowly advanced, using every means at his disposal to penetrate layer upon layer of restrictions.</p><p>The closer he got to the crystal, the more overwhelming the true dragon's pressure became.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's clan possessed true dragon bloodline.  He used a bloodline secret technique, covering himself in blood-based wards to prevent the seal from backfiring, forcibly breaking the restrictions and approaching the crystal.</p><p>Lightly touching it, the crystal was icy and incredibly hard.</p><p>He didn't act rashly, carefully sensing for any anomalies in the seal or the crystal.  Retreating to the ancient hall's entrance, he exchanged a look with Jiu Ming Xuan Gui, and summoned his golden spear.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The golden spear struck the crystal.</p><p>The crystal remained unscathed.</p><p>Instantly, a sudden change occurred. The ancient hall trembled, and a crack appeared in the ground beneath the crystal pillar, rapidly expanding, threatening to reach their feet in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Within the fissure, an ancient restriction manifested as a curtain, with fine cracks subtly appearing within it.</p><p>A massive tremor erupted, and the crystal shook violently.</p><p>As the two beings prepared to continue their attack on the crystal pillar, the crystal suddenly blazed with blinding light, and an unparalleled dragon's might pressed down upon them.</p><p>Simultaneously, an incredibly powerful suction force erupted from the ancient restriction.</p><p>The sudden change startled both beings.</p><p>‘Rumbling!’</p><p>The suction force burst from the stone hall, causing the poisonous lake to surge back, instantly spreading in all directions.</p><p>Overwhelmed by the dragon's might, they were unable to employ any countermeasures, not even having the chance to use the Heavenly Phoenix Feather, before being sucked into the crack in the restriction's curtain.</p><p>……</p><p>Another poisonous lake.</p><p>The Great Shaman and Fang Laomo were working together to break the ancient divine runes.</p><p>Beneath the stone platform was a passage.</p><p>Reaching the end of the passage, they witnessed a shocking sight.</p><p>A fiery red divine furnace hovered in mid-air.</p><p>The divine furnace was covered in dense ancient divine runes, clearly an ancient treasure of the Witch Clan.</p><p>Inside the furnace, a flame flickered, on the verge of extinction, its warmth faint.</p><p>Upon seeing the furnace, the Great Shaman and Fang Laomo were instantly dumbfounded.</p><p>It was a type of divine rune inscription they had never seen before, harmonizing with heaven and earth, inspiring awe.</p><p>For countless generations, Witch Clan cultivators had searched tirelessly, scouring the Canglang Sea and the surrounding storm zones, yet found nothing, their lineage of divine runes severed.</p><p>They could only cultivate human techniques; the only remaining trace of their heritage was perhaps the Witch Clan's witchcraft, even that with many secrets lost.</p><p>Now, they finally saw a glimmer of hope!</p><p>After their initial elation, the two noticed the divine runes on the furnace were incomplete, likely due to the furnace's weakening power causing the runes to fade.</p><p>Fang Laomo dashed towards the furnace, but the Great Shaman stopped him.</p><p>“This ancient divine inscription didn’t appear here without reason. It’s likely some kind of seal. Although we are sworn enemies of the human race, our roots lie in the Inner Sea.  We rise and fall together. If we release a great demon, we won't be able to stay out of it. Countless ordinary people cannot leave the Witch God Continent. If this brings about a great calamity, it will result in a river of blood!”</p><p>The Great Shaman said gravely, “Don't be reckless!”</p><p>Fang Laomo snorted in annoyance.</p><p>The Great Shaman stared intently at Fang Laomo.</p><p>Finally, Fang Laomo yielded.</p><p>They worked together to break the ancient divine runes, proceeding slowly, carefully observing the runes’ fluctuations each time to ensure there were no anomalies before continuing.</p><p>With each successful breaking of a rune, the furnace reacted, emitting immense pressure.</p><p>The Great Shaman channeled divine runes and Witch Clan secret techniques, using their bloodline to lessen the furnace's hostility.</p><p>To their delight, each time the furnace reacted, more runes were activated, leaving the two enthralled as they committed every ancient divine rune to memory, enabling them to comprehend the Dao of divine runes in the future.</p><p>Just then, the furnace suddenly hummed, its internal flame surging, ablaze with crimson.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The ground cracked open.</p><p>The ancient restriction curtain appeared and then unleashed a massive suction force.  As they struggled to withstand the furnace's might, they were helplessly drawn inside.</p><p>……</p><p>On Yitian Peak.</p><p>Three grand cultivator-level experts besieged the ancient demon. The elder from the Four Saints Palace prepared the Demon Suppressing Stele while simultaneously dashing towards the fissure in the ground.</p><p>Qing Zhu remained motionless, appearing calm, but internally, a fierce struggle was raging as the demon soul fiercely resisted, preventing Qing Zhu from being distracted.</p><p>The ancient demon madly surged towards the fissure.</p><p>He couldn't activate the magical restriction he'd placed on Mo Qingzhu.  Either his true form had tampered with it, or Qingzhu's true spirit had suppressed it somehow.</p><p>Being outmaneuvered by his true form was simply infuriating.</p><p>Gu Mo knew he'd only recently regained his strength after absorbing three Nascent Souls, and it wouldn't last. Once the Town Demon Stele was restored, or Madam Li and her people repaired the altar, his situation would become dire.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>The Demon Lord and the others attacked with all their might.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The battle was incredibly fierce.</p><p>The sky darkened, the radiant light obscured, the ground shattered.</p><p>In the ground fissure…</p><p>A large crack in the barrier extended to the altar and seal set up by the Four Saints.  On the altar was an exceptionally complex array, one Mo Qingzhu had secretly set up after the Four Saints Palace took the Town Demon Stele, weakening the ancient restriction.</p><p>The array was in operation, like iron shears shredding the altar.</p><p>An elder flew to the array and, following Qingzhu's instructions, began to dismantle it.</p><p>The altar shook, stones flew, but it remained intact.  It required the combined power of Gu Mo and Mo Qingzhu to fully unleash its power.  With Mo Qingzhu suppressed by her true form, only Gu Mo remained.</p><p>Braving the relentless attacks, Gu Mo used a secret technique to forcibly activate the unrefined power of the Nascent Souls within him, even burning his essence, and roared to the heavens, gathering all his demonic energy in a mighty blow against the array.</p><p>The elder’s eyes widened, and he dodged.</p><p>Demonic energy poured into the array.</p><p>Simultaneously, a powerful shockwave erupted from the barrier, cooperating with Gu Mo's spirit.</p><p>An astounding surge of energy exploded.</p><p>The altar cracked, the seal, overwhelmed, dimmed, revealing a weakness.</p><p>Gu Mo laughed wildly.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>After the seal was breached, a tremendous sucking force erupted from within, catching the Demon Lord and the others off guard and drawing them into the barrier.  Gu Mo’s spirit, the elder, and Qingzhu were also caught.</p><p>In an instant, the fierce battle ceased.</p><p>Moreover, the suction wasn't limited to that spot; it affected the entire fissure in the barrier.</p><p>In the ancient cliff temple…</p><p>After the elder left, he sealed the temple, leaving two descendants of the Four Saints Palace inside, who dared not leave.</p><p>A fissure opened in the ground, the cliff split, and boulders fell.  This was the source.</p><p>Their master had not returned, and the two were frantic.  The young man went to inform their master, while the girl remained to guard the ancient restriction.  Both were then pulled into the vortex.</p><p>A great upheaval was about to begin.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>A section of Yitian Peak fell!</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed from deep within the secluded valley, causing the entire valley to tremble violently.</p><p>Outside the Zhenling Domain, the demon kings and Nascent Soul masters exchanged bewildered glances, unsure of what had happened inside.</p><p>Nine-Phoenix King had initially assumed the poisonous pool's currents were normal, but now realized that unforeseen changes had occurred at Yitian Peak.</p><p>She flew out of the Zhenling Domain, turning to look at Yitian Peak, her expression shifting constantly.</p>
