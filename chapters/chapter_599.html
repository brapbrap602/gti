<h1>Chapter 592: The Great Sun</h1><p>Qin Sang was stunned by Yun Youzi's astonishing words. Even the most talented cultivators with exceptional spiritual roots wouldn't dare to consider forming a Nascent Soul as easy as taking something from one's pocket.  </p><p>Didn't Chen Yan need to resort to demonic arts to break through?</p><p>Yet Yun Youzi dared!</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang came to her senses, realizing that the two calamities Yun Youzi mentioned – the first, likely damage to her soul – but she didn't know what the second would be.</p><p>As they spoke, they finally broke through the numerous restrictions and left the ancient medicinal garden.</p><p>With Yun Youzi leading the way, Qin Sang remained vigilant, successfully avoiding the cultivators from Tianyao Hill, and smoothly arrived outside the ancient medicinal garden. After clarifying her direction, she immediately set off.</p><p>Yun Youzi had also recovered considerably and didn’t need Qin Sang to carry him; he could move on his own, and their speed increased significantly.</p><p>Qin Sang raised her wrist, checking the wooden bracelet.</p><p>The bracelet showed no obvious changes; only the surface luster seemed slightly dimmer. The good news was that there were no cracks, so there was no immediate worry about it shattering.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally calculated the distances between her planned destinations, turning to say, "Senior, I need to go somewhere to find something. This place happens to be on the way to the Gathering Spirit Palace. I plan to go there first; it shouldn't take too long…"</p><p>The original plan was to send Yun Youzi to recover after leaving the ancient medicinal garden, and then Qin Sang would go alone to where Senior Qingzhu disappeared to look for her remains.</p><p>This was because the place Yun Youzi needed to go was not far from the ancient medicinal garden.</p><p>Now, however, she needed to go to the Gathering Spirit Palace first to find the Three Lights Jade Liquid, making the route a zig-zag.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu's disappearance and the Gathering Spirit Palace were in the same direction, slightly offset. Fortunately, it wouldn't require too much of a detour. To save time, Qin Sang had to change her plan.</p><p>Ziwei Palace was vast and sparsely populated.</p><p>Unless her luck was exceptionally bad, she shouldn’t encounter Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan easily.  Qin Sang and Yun Youzi didn't dare to fly brazenly at high altitudes, but they didn’t need to be overly cautious either; their speed traversing mountains and rivers was not slow.</p><p>Before long, they found the mountain indicated by Old Woman Jing.</p><p>"It's in the mountain. Please wait here for a moment, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards a mountain peak.</p><p>It was then that Qin Sang understood why Old Woman Jing, when giving directions, only said that once she reached the vicinity of this mountain, she wouldn’t need further guidance to easily find the ancient temple.</p><p>This mountain was surrounded by a circle of large and small lakes, with clear water connecting the waterways.  The shores and mountain were covered with ancient trees of unknown age.</p><p>It was a deep forest, with lush branches and leaves, and vines like pythons.</p><p>From the trees, wisps of mist drifted through the leaves.  This wasn’t ordinary water mist; it had a faint grayish-white tint. Qin Sang guessed it was likely瘴气 (a miasma), formed from accumulated decaying matter, trapped in the forest, becoming increasingly concentrated over time.</p><p>This type of miasma was mostly poisonous and shouldn't be underestimated.</p><p>However, its toxicity was probably not as potent as the Peach Blossom Miasma encountered before.  With careful handling, there should be no major problems.</p><p>This mountain stood amidst a cluster of lakes.  The whole mountain was visible, covered in ancient trees like those below, a scene of deep, verdant greenery.</p><p>There were no mystical lights, no mysterious ancient temples.</p><p>There were no remnants of formations or ancient restrictions, nor any resulting strange phenomena.</p><p>Everything appeared normal.</p><p>But when Qin Sang arrived, not yet at the foot of the mountain, just standing at the edge of the lake, she already felt a significant anomaly.</p><p>The anomaly came from the Ebony Sword!</p><p>Something in the mountain seemed to have a subtle connection with the Ebony Sword.</p><p>To be precise, it was the killing talismans on the sword.</p><p>The killing talismans emitted strange fluctuations, as if responding to a call from within the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang said a word to Yun Youzi, leaped into the forest, activated the Corpse Pill to isolate the miasma, grabbed the faint connection, and sped towards the mountain.</p><p>When Old Woman Jing gave directions, she was vague, only specifying the mountain's location without mentioning any dangers within, seemingly unclear about the details herself.</p><p>Although Ziwei Palace had no living creatures, it had many strange restrictions and dangerous remnants of formations. Qin Sang didn’t dare to seal the Corpse Pill, carefully taking out the Ten Directions Yama Banner and proceeding cautiously towards the peak.</p><p>The closer she got to the foot of the mountain, the clearer the connection became.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang lifted her head, her gaze fixed on a spot near the summit.</p><p>There was nothing special about it; like other areas, it was covered with ancient trees, each crown immensely large, stacked together like towering pagodas, blocking out the sky and completely concealing the scene below.</p><p>She directly flew towards it, stepping on the tree crowns.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The mountain wind rustled the leaves, creating a continuous sound.</p><p>The air under the trees was stifling, thick with a miasma that shrouded everything in a greyish-white haze.  The ground was a thick, centuries-old layer of decaying vegetation, like a swamp, emitting a foul odor.</p><p>Qin Sang, using the branches for leverage, leaped and scrambled, finally reaching his destination.</p><p>He found himself standing on a protruding tree root before a towering cliff face, hidden from view by the immense surrounding trees.  The sheer drop was completely invisible from the outside.</p><p>The cliff was covered in giant, snake-like vines, revealing only glimpses of the white rock beneath.  The cliff itself looked unremarkable, its surface rough and uneven, showing no signs of any enchantment. Qin Sang would have easily overlooked it were it not for the clear connection his talisman sensed emanating from within.  The feeling was unmistakable.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his hand, conjuring blades of spiritual energy to cut away the vines, fully exposing the cliff face.  A strange feature became apparent: the cliff was perfectly circular, like a sun embedded in the mountainside.</p><p>It faced directly east.  One could imagine that before the growth of such tall ancient trees and dense vines, when the sun rose, the purple qi of the east, the bright morning sun, would have bathed the cliff in its light!</p><p>Two suns shining together – what a magnificent sight that must have been!</p><p>But time marches on. The Ziwei Palace fell into ruin, and the former glory was lost, concealed by the encroaching wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, dismissing the fantasy and returning to reality.  Apart from the imagined scene, the cliff was unremarkable. He flew to the top, examining it meticulously, but found no carvings left by previous visitors.</p><p>There was no doubt this place was connected to the "Chapter on Cultivating the Soul Sword," yet there were no carvings, not even a sword scratch.</p><p>Qin Sang fixed his gaze on the cliff, then touched his forehead.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>His ebony sword left his hand, circling briefly before him, then blazed with light as an ethereal sword energy shot forth!</p><p>"Thump!"</p><p>The energy struck the cliff face. Qin Sang had held nothing back, unleashing his most powerful technique.</p><p>But the expected impact never came.  The sword energy vanished without a trace, leaving not even a scratch, as if absorbed by the cliff itself.</p>
