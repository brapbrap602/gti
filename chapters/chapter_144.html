**Chapter 137: Severing the Nascent Soul**

"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Gong."
Qin Sang bowed.
"You!"
Senior Martial Brother Gong evidently remembered Qin Sang. He said with a complicated look in his eyes, "Junior Martial Brother Qin has come to select a cultivation method, is that right? The cultivation methods on the second level can be browsed freely. Junior Martial Brother Qin may choose one for free. If you wish to cultivate an incantation, you will need spirit stones in exchange, with the value determined by the power of the incantation."
Upon entering the grand hall, Qin Sang discovered that it was quite different from the Core Formation Room. Dozens of jade pillars were arranged in the grand hall, each levitating a ball of light. The walls behind were lined with jade slips.
He approached the jade pillar closest to him and saw the characters written on it: "Methods of Forgetting Thoughts."
He swept his divine sense over the ball of light, reading it carefully. He discovered that the Methods of Forgetting Thoughts was a cultivation method that could lead straight to the Nascent Soul stage. However, just as the Headmaster had said, it had only one supernatural ability at the Core Formation stage, which was for fleeing.
If he chose this cultivation method and did not have a formidable magic device, he should never consider engaging in head-to-head combat.
Amassing an extreme-grade magic device already required an enormous amount of effort, and Qin Sang's collection of extreme-grade magic devices was not often seen even among Core Formation stage cultivators.
Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense from the ball of light and began walking around the grand hall. Every ball of light housed a cultivation method. However, the core parts of the cultivation methods were sealed off with restrictions. Only after he made his selection could he go out and ask Senior Martial Brother Gong to impart the method.
These cultivation methods were all profound and broadened Qin Sang's horizons. More than half of them were incomplete, but there were also complete cultivation methods that could lead to the Dao of Transformation.
For some unknown reason, the Minor Cold Domain had not produced a Transformation stage grandmaster for countless years. Countless prodigies like Patriarch Kui Yin had ended their days at the Nascent Soul stage.
Qin Sang did not dare think so far ahead. Regardless of whether a cultivation method was incomplete, it was fine as long as the Core Formation stage portion was complete.
He had also looked through the cultivation methods recommended by Headmaster Yu.
It was indeed as the Headmaster had said. With his talent, he could only choose from the Methods of Forgetting Thoughts or similar cultivation methods.
Even so, his hopes of forming a Golden Core were very faint.
Headmaster Yu had subtly advised him.
Of the Core Formation stage cultivators, less than one in a hundred succeeded in forming a Golden Core. Rather than chasing after that elusive hope, many preferred to choose a cultivation method with powerful supernatural abilities, only seeking to satisfy their grievances, keep a clear conscience, and avoid wasting two hundred years.
But how could Qin Sang be willing to resign himself to that?
He withdrew his divine sense from the "Nascent Soul Scripture" and glanced around, walking straight to the innermost row of jade pillars in the grand hall.
**Chapter of the Spirit Sword!**
As his divine sense probed the ball of light, he immediately saw seven large characters. Qin Sang's mind shook violently.
"Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill!"
The seven blood-red characters exuded a terrifying killing intent!
At that moment, Qin Sang felt as if he had been placed on a bloody battlefield, enveloped by an extreme killing intent. His hairs stood on end, and he had the illusion that he was about to be torn to shreds by the violent killing qi!
Suppressing the shock in his heart, Qin Sang continued to read the cultivation method. The more he read, the greater his astonishment and horror. A hint of hesitation appeared in his eyes after a while, but his expression gradually turned firm. He seized the ball of light and strode out of the grand hall.
"Chapter of the Spirit Sword!"
Senior Martial Brother Gong stared at Qin Sang in amazement, as if looking at a madman. He sighed and said, "First theâ€¦and now the Chapter of the Spirit Sword. It's true what they say: no madness, no survival! You've heard of Senior Martial Brother Qingzhu's legend, haven't you? But do you know how Senior Martial Brother Qingzhu cultivated the Chapter of the Spirit Sword?"
"Please advise me, Senior Martial Brother Gong."
Qin Sang was indeed very curious.
This cultivation method was incomplete. Its origins were unknown, and it only had the first five levels, allowing for cultivation up to the early Golden Core stage.
The name "Chapter of the Spirit Sword" had been added later by later generations, based on the characteristics of the cultivation method itself.
As the name suggested, this cultivation method was not like ordinary sword cultivators, who lodged their divine senses in their spirit swords and nourished them in their Dantian. Instead, it was a genuine Spirit Sword! It allowed the spirit sword and divine sense to intermingle!
Having cultivated the Xuanguang Sword Arts, Qin Sang had some knowledge of the path of the sword cultivator. He had never heard of anything like this. If it were not for the explicit confirmation from his sect, stating that Senior Martial Brother Qingzhu had cultivated this very cultivation method, he would have suspected that the Chapter of the Spirit Sword was fake and intended to deceive people.
Spirit swords were sharp weapons. Sword qi was extremely sharp.
Before the Nascent Soul stage, cultivators' divine senses were very fragile.
As required by the cultivation method, cultivators would pierce their divine senses with their spirit swords, enduring the constant suffering of the sword qi gnawing at their divine senses. This was an unimaginable agony that originated from the depths of the soul.
And that was not all. The Chapter of the Spirit Sword had an even more terrifying requirement.

When practicing this cultivation method, one must visualize the Extermination Talisman in the method, guiding the intent to kill into the divine soul, and finally solidifying the Extermination Talisman onto the sword body. This is both nurturing the sword and refining the sword!

The divine soul is always affected by the intent to kill. Once the mind is invaded by the intent to kill and cannot defend the original mind, there is only one final result. The intent to kill will take over, causing the loss of the mind, and one will become a killing machine!

As the realm improves, the intent to kill condensed in the Extermination Talisman will grow stronger and stronger. No matter how firm one's nature is, it will not be able to resist. The invasion of the mind is inevitable.

There must be another divine soul secret method in this cultivation method that can resist the intent to kill and strengthen the original mind. Otherwise, it would not be possible to practice at all.

I wonder how Senior Qing Zhu practiced this incomplete cultivation method?

"It is said that Senior Qing Zhu directly cut his divine soul in half with a secret method, using half of his divine soul to nurture the sword, in order to remove some of the hidden dangers of the cultivation method. The final result was still insanity. If you are worried about your foundation, you don't need to take this risk. The Taiyi Pill Sect is the best in the pill Dao. Maybe there is a way to restore the foundation. Junior Brother Qin, are you sure you want to practice this <Divine Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter>? "

Having said this, Senior Brother Gong took a deep look at Qin Sang.

Qin Sang was stunned. He thought he was ruthless enough to face Senior Qing Zhu, but he could only feel inferior.

Foundation Building cultivators can indeed manifest divine consciousness and control several magic tools at the same time, but that is just splitting divine consciousness.

Cutting the divine soul in half and not only not dying, but forming a Core Formation in just forty years, setting a record for the sect, what a powerful will?

Qin Sang took a deep breath and nodded: "Please pass on the method to me, Senior Brother."

Senior Brother Gong had only given this reminder because he could not help but recall his feelings when he had met Qin Sang.

Seeing that Qin Sang had already made up his mind, he stopped persuading him. He placed his palm above the sphere of light, activated the restriction, and then a stream of flowing light flew out from the sphere of light and entered Qin Sang's brow chakra.

The complete cultivation method appeared in his mind. Qin Sang scanned it and saw the core Extermination Talisman of the method, only to feel a stabbing pain in his divine consciousness.

At this time, Senior Brother Gong suddenly said, "I will not deceive Junior Brother Qin. I once wanted to make a desperate gamble and practice this cultivation method, so I researched it for a period of time. As far as I can guess, this cultivation method requires the most extreme intent to kill. It is not enough to just visualize the Extermination Talisman. One must personally enter the Path of Slaughter before one can gain some experience. I hope you will take care."
