<h1>Chapter 658: A Strange Core Formation</h1><p>“Finally.”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a slow breath.</p><p>Du Xian's estimate was off by two days; something must have delayed them.</p><p>Du Han rode a golden, leaf-shaped flying artifact, accompanied by the disciple who had fetched him.  The extra passenger slightly hampered their speed, but they were still fast.</p><p>“Reporting to Master, Senior Brother has sent a message. They are currently at the Five Venom Sect. The Bear Mountain region is secure, and the Core Formation cultivator hasn't returned.”</p><p>Du Han sat cross-legged on the golden leaf, his disciple standing respectfully behind him, holding a transmission talisman. He spoke softly.</p><p>This talisman was, of course, sent by Du Xian under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>Du Han nodded slightly, gazing towards the Five Venom Sect.  He frowned in disapproval. “How careless! Why are they still lingering at the Five Venom Sect? Are they trying to make it easy for that Core Formation cultivator to find them?”</p><p>The disciple hesitated, then softly defended Du Xian. “Master, rest assured, Senior Brother has surely considered everything. Perhaps he anticipated your arrival and went to the Five Venom Sect to welcome you. That Core Formation cultivator achieved his breakthrough less than a year ago.  Moreover, according to the Five Venom Sect's leader, there seems to be an issue with his natal insect gu. He's gone to search for a new insect to refine a new gu. His return is unlikely in the near future. Once Senior Brother Jiu Shan and the others recover, with the protection of the Five Venom Sect's defensive formation, they can hold out for a while even if he appears suddenly.”</p><p>Du Han snorted.  “I believe your cultivation within the sect has made you too comfortable and complacent. Underestimating cultivators with higher realms, especially one a full major realm above you, will never end well! Once this matter is resolved, you will all go on separate training journeys to avoid becoming frogs in a well.”</p><p>The disciple didn't dare argue and lowered his head in acknowledgment.</p><p>As they spoke, the golden leaf arced through the air, speeding toward the Five Venom Sect.</p><p>The Five Venom Sect was in sight.  From a distance, they could see the lotus-shaped defensive formation and the illusory shadows of several perilous peaks within.</p><p>Du Han stood, gazing at the sect.</p><p>After a moment, a strange look crossed his face. He asked in a low voice, "Did you attack the Five Venom Sect's defensive formation when you entered?”</p><p>Sensing the shift in Du Han’s tone, the disciple quickly looked towards the sect.  Seeing the formation functioning normally, he appeared bewildered. “No, Master. We followed your orders to the letter, employing local forces to search for the ancient corpse. We committed no offenses along the way.  Senior Brother revealed our affiliation with the Li Wu Palace, and the Five Venom Sect readily admitted us.  We didn't anticipate the sect leader possessing a talisman treasure, which led to the injuries of our two senior brothers…Master, has something happened to them?”</p><p>Du Han shook his head, pondering. “I have an interest in formation arrays and once had in-depth discussions with a human cultivator who specialized in them.  This Five Venom Sect's defensive formation appears… peculiar.  There are several incongruities…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, Du Han suddenly felt a jolt in his heart.</p><p>In that instant, his hairs stood on end. A sense of impending doom washed over him, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>“Who’s there?!”</p><p>As Du Han roared, a blinding light erupted from the mountain ahead of them.  It was a swift and devastating sword beam.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't chosen to ambush them at the Five Venom Sect, opting for this location. He was worried that Du Han might notice something amiss with the sect's defensive formation or with Du Xian and the others, raising his guard.</p><p>To ensure a swift victory and capture Du Xian and his companions, Qin Sang had been forced to break through the Five Venom Sect's defensive formation by brute force.</p><p>Although he had repaired the formation, he lacked confidence in his own formation skills and feared that Du Han might become suspicious upon closer inspection.</p><p>After careful consideration, he had decided to lay an ambush outside the sect.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Du Han seemed quite knowledgeable about formations, noticing something off from such a distance. Qin Sang felt a surge of relief but didn't dare wait for him to get any closer. He was forced to act.</p><p>Fortunately, the distance wasn't too great.</p><p>Feeling the terrifying aura of the sword beam, the disciple’s legs trembled. He finally understood his master’s earlier words.</p><p>“Core Formation!”</p><p>Du Han’s eyes flashed, instantly realizing that something had happened to his disciples.</p><p>Those he had brought to the Western Frontier were the most talented among his followers, with Du Xian being his most cherished and promising student.</p><p>The thought that they might have been killed by this person enraged him, filling him with a desire for revenge.</p><p>However, as this thought crossed his mind, a faint rumble of thunder reached his ears.  He suddenly recalled a legendary sword technique coveted by countless sword cultivators, and a sense of foreboding washed over him.</p><p>“Sword Qi Thunderclap!”</p><p>Du Han was horrified. He never expected to encounter a swordsmanship genius in the Wu God Continent who could comprehend Sword Qi Thunderclap so soon after reaching Core Formation.</p><p>Without hesitation, he slapped his dantian.  A surge of light erupted, and a pale bone claw flew out from his qi sea.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, a sword shadow pierced the void, appearing before Du Han.</p><p>Du Han's pupils constricted. He finally understood why sword cultivators yearned for Sword Qi Thunderclap: its speed was simply too fast!</p><p>Despite the shock, Du Han remained composed.  The bone claw moved with surprising agility, intercepting the sword shadow at the last moment.</p><p>A pale, otherworldly light shimmered on the claw as it grasped at the sword shadow.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Seeing the bone claw, Qin Sang, who was arriving on his sword, let out a surprised murmur.</p><p>He clearly sensed that this claw was Du Han’s natal magic treasure!</p><p>Du Han, a Wu Clan cultivator from a prominent sect, hadn’t refined a natal insect gu but had chosen a magic treasure like a human cultivator.</p><p>This was incredibly strange and completely unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't discovered this information from Du Xian and the others; Du Han had concealed it well, even from his disciples.</p><p>Including the magic treasure bestowed by the Li Wu Palace, Du Han possessed two magic treasures!</p><p>Qin Sang had set his trap with Du Han’s natal insect gu in mind; he hadn’t anticipated this.</p><p>Furthermore, this wasn’t the only strange thing about Du Han.</p><p>As he approached, Qin Sang sensed a faint demonic aura emanating from Du Han. He initially assumed Du Han had a spirit beast and became wary, but he found no spirit beast pouch or anything similar.</p><p>Then there was Du Han's strength.</p><p>His aura was powerful, but not at the level expected of someone nearing the middle stage of Core Formation. It was weaker than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>Judging by his initial panic, Du Han hadn't been feigning weakness. He wouldn't have held back in such a situation.</p><p>Perhaps Du Han suffered from some hidden ailment or there was another explanation.</p><p>Regardless, it was advantageous for Qin Sang.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through his mind, but Qin Sang remained focused on the fight.</p>
