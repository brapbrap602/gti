<h1>Chapter 2090: Collapse</h1><p>The suffocating white waves nearly swallowed them whole. Time seemed to freeze. Qin Li and the little fox were stiff, unable to fight back.  Suddenly, the water droplets around them silently dissolved, and all the pressure vanished.</p><p>Man and fox burst forward, like drowning men finally gasping for air, reborn.</p><p>They hid behind Jian Yi, still shaken. Looking back, they found the white waves had completely disappeared. Jian Yi hadn't drawn his sword; he'd dispelled the waves with his sword intent alone.</p><p>A Changyou Tribe expert, who had attacked earlier, looked over, witnessing this scene. He coldly snorted, his eyes flashing with ferocity.  He whispered to his companions for a moment before separating from the battle and moving towards them across the waves.</p><p>Qin Li and the little fox stiffened, their tension returning. This person was even stronger than their previous opponents. Jian Yi had just broken through to the Golden Core stage; he was certainly no match for him.  Their attempt to aid Jian Yi had instead put him in even greater danger.</p><p>"What do we do now?"</p><p>The little fox paced anxiously.</p><p>"You go first."</p><p>Jian Yi responded as always, calm and composed, showing no trace of the recent fierce battle. He raised his spirit sword, leaping forward, and simultaneously sent a voice transmission, "Something's wrong. The Changyou Tribe might have a major conspiracy. Return to camp and report immediately!"</p><p>Qin Li and the little fox had sensed this too. Jian Yi’s confirmation only strengthened their urgency. They knew the stakes; they had to report back immediately. This wasn't the time for sentimentality, and besides, staying wouldn't help.</p><p>They hadn't flown far when they heard a series of enormous explosions behind them, followed by waves of powerful true energy rippling outward.  They were startled and dared not hesitate.</p><p>When they returned to the main camp, they found it bustling with activity. Countless figures flew through the air, their shimmering lights forming a colorful curtain in the sky; a chilling atmosphere enveloped them.</p><p>The Storm Realm's defensive position was a densely packed archipelago stretching north and south.  Over the years, they had invested countless resources in building an impregnable defense line.  In the last battle against the Changyou Tribe, this line had stubbornly held, never breached.</p><p>Those shimmering curtains were massive arrays, standing above the islands, interconnected, stretching endlessly along the islands, like walls built in the void, reaching to the heavens.</p><p>There were designated passageways through the curtains, heavily guarded and prepared for battle.</p><p>Qin Li and the little fox landed before one such passage.  The guards' sharp eyes fixed on them; they felt locked in by a powerful presence that could easily obliterate them.</p><p>"State your name and business!"</p><p>A guard shouted.</p><p>"I am Qin Li, a disciple of the Green Sheep Temple, under General Hong’s command…"</p><p>Qin Li, careful not to make any sudden movements, explained loudly, presenting his identification badge to the guard.</p><p>Once his identity was confirmed, the guards opened the passage, but two more guards were assigned to watch them closely as they were taken to see the local commander.</p><p>Suppressing their anxiety, they soon found themselves in a large hall before the commander.  "Greetings, General Jin Ling."</p><p>General Jin Ling looked up, his gaze sharp as a sword, seeming to penetrate their thoughts. "You seem uneasy. What happened to you out there?"</p><p>"We were about to report to the General…"</p><p>At this moment, the little fox, with her sharp tongue, took the lead, explaining the situation to General Jin Ling.</p><p>General Jin Ling hummed. "We've received reports of Changyou Tribe activity.  Your concern for the overall situation and timely report are commendable... Take them to their quarters."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Two guards bowed in response.</p><p>The little fox was frantic. "Jian Yi and the others are under attack by Changyou Tribe experts. The situation is critical. Please send reinforcements immediately, otherwise…"</p><p>However, General Jin Ling remained unmoved. He waved his hand, a gentle force pushing them out of the hall. Two guards stepped in front of Qin Li and the little fox. "Please follow us, both of you."</p><p>"No!"</p><p>The little fox screamed, Qin Li kneeling in supplication.</p><p>The two guards' faces darkened.  "Don't make trouble.  Those who have fallen behind will be rescued.  The situation is critical; we lack personnel everywhere, and cannot arbitrarily dispatch troops. Return to your quarters and await orders!"</p><p>"I won't go!  Leaving our comrades to die, what kind of general are you?!"  The little fox yelled at the hall door, her voice shrill.</p><p>“How dare you!  Insolence! You will regret this!”</p><p>Two guards exploded with rage.  With a swoosh, two golden chains shot from their sleeves towards the little fox.</p><p>The little fox, incredibly agile, dodged between the chains, then pointed at Qin Li and yelled,  "You dare harm me! We are disciples of Qingyang Temple, and he is of the Qin bloodline! His fifth grandfather is Qin Hongyuan. We demand to see him!"</p><p>Qin Hongyuan was a renowned expert of Qingyang Temple, his name echoing with power. The two guards hesitated.</p><p>At that moment, other guards arrived.</p><p>A guard captain sneered, "This is the front line, not your Qingyang Temple! Even if you're the Grand Master's most favored disciple, you must obey orders! And what of your Qin bloodline? You dare cause a disturbance in the General's Mansion? Let's see if Elder Qin recognizes you! Seize them!"</p><p>The guards swarmed them. Qin Li and the little fox were no match.  In the blink of an eye, they were bound tightly.  Their anxiety was useless.</p><p>Their status did offer some protection. The guard captain didn't punish them but personally escorted them back to camp, handing them over to General Hong.</p><p>After the guards left, Qin Li and the little fox pleaded incessantly. General Hong, also worried about Jian Yi and the others, agreed to help with their request.  But until they received orders, they couldn't leave the camp.</p><p>They tried everything, but it was like a stone thrown into the sea—no response. The longer it took, the more hopeless it became.</p><p>Just as despair set in, orders finally arrived. But it wasn't to rescue Jian Yi. They were ordered to retreat!</p><p>Normally, a priority retreat would be welcome, a chance to escape danger. But now, they felt a burning resentment, a desire to kill more of the Changyou people to avenge Jian Yi.</p><p>What baffled them most was the retreat order itself. Even if they couldn't engage the enemy, they should at least hold this defensive line. Why retreat?</p><p>On the battlefield, everyone has a role. Even those with low cultivation could guard a node in the formation.  The combined power of countless cultivators was vital to maintain the formation's stability.</p><p>"Why retreat? Where are we going?"</p><p>Despite their protests, Qin Li and the little fox received no answers and were forced to retreat with General Hong.</p><p>*Splash…splash…splash…*</p><p>The waves crashed.</p><p>Aboard their magic boat, they saw the lights of countless other magic boats, each overflowing with cultivators, fleeing the front lines.  It looked like a rout.</p><p>"Why retreat? Why now...?"</p><p>Qin Li muttered. The little fox was equally puzzled.</p><p>There hadn't been a direct confrontation; perhaps fighting was occurring elsewhere, but the flames of war hadn't reached them yet.  This retreat, without a fight, was essentially handing over the carefully constructed defense lines.</p><p>Why such a foolish decision? Did command believe the line was indefensible, unwilling to suffer needless casualties?</p><p>This possibility sent a shiver down the little fox's spine.</p><p>The first line was the strongest. If it collapsed without a fight, how could the next lines hold?</p><p>If the situation continued to deteriorate, would the enemy invade the heart of the North Sea, even occupy the four regions of the North Sea?</p><p>Terror seized the little fox.  It had never imagined this scenario. Such a strong defensive line, collapsing…  The situation seemed to be sliding in the worst possible direction.</p><p>Even if its fears were confirmed, it could do nothing. They were mere grains of sand caught in a raging river, powerless to change or escape.  Their only hope was timely reinforcements from the Central Plains.</p><p>They were transported by magic boat to the second line of defense.  Orders poured in, and they were immediately engaged in preparing and activating the local formations.  The tasks were overwhelming, leaving no time, or perhaps no desire, to dwell on the retreat.</p><p>Reports from the front lines arrived frequently. Qin Li and the little fox couldn't access them, but they sensed the worsening situation from the increasingly grave expressions of the generals.</p><p>Finally, their worst fears were realized. The front line completely collapsed. Years of development by the North Sea sects were ruined in an instant.</p><p>Route after route of defeated soldiers retreated to their location.  The defensive force strengthened, but Qin Li and the little fox grew increasingly despondent.</p><p>On the battlefield, origins from Qianshan Bamboo Forest or Qingyang Temple meant nothing. Qingyang Temple never showed favoritism; they were no different from ordinary cultivators.  Survival depended entirely on luck.</p><p>Without the temple's protection, they understood their own insignificance. Without powerful strength, they were nothing more than ants.</p><p>The second line of defense was far less complete than the first, divided into several battlefields, each fighting independently.</p><p>They were lucky; the attackers weren't the main force of the Changyou tribe, but Qin Li and the little fox still experienced the horrors of war firsthand.</p><p>...</p><p>The Demon Sea.</p><p>Between the Demon Sea and the eastern sea of Zhongzhou lies a vast expanse of water.  Ordinary islands have long been destroyed by storms, leaving few places to land. Only some sea demons dwell there.</p><p>These demons lack a unified lineage; each achieved their power individually, and none are particularly strong. The Changyou tribe regularly purges them, turning the area into a barren wasteland.</p><p>The sea is vast, making it impossible for the Changyou tribe to monitor every location.</p><p>Near the Demon Sea, hidden from Changyou eyes, a large demon army lay in wait.</p><p>These cultivators are highly disciplined, concealed deep beneath the waves. Their ships are enormous clam shells, each large enough to create a dry interior space, allowing non-aquatic demons to live and cultivate within, masking their aura.</p><p>Besides the clamshells, there are huge seashells and other oddly shaped magical artifacts, each concealing a squad of waiting demons.</p><p>They are arranged in neat rows on the seabed, appearing to have been in place for a long time. Some are covered in moss and seaweed, camouflaged as underwater hills.</p><p>Outer patrols consist of dragons and golden toads, also concealing their presence, maintaining absolute silence.</p><p>The seawater here is darker than elsewhere, like fog on land—a result of a concealing array.</p><p>This is the Demon Sea army.</p><p>After deciding to retake the Demon Sea, the Dragon King and the Golden Toad King secretly contacted various tribes to prepare.</p><p>The Dragon, Phoenix, and Golden Toad clans agreed unanimously. Other tribes, even those content with Zhongzhou, dared not oppose the reclaiming of their ancestral lands.  </p><p>Secretly, each tribe began dispatching experts, concealing their movements and sending them to the North Sea in batches.</p><p>The Changyou tribe showed no unusual activity in the Western Wasteland.  The front lines were relaxed, allowing the demons to leave behind only a small force to guard the Western Wasteland and achieve a deception on a grand scale.</p><p>Neither humans, witches, nor the Changyou tribe seemed to notice their maneuvers.  Everything went smoothly.</p><p>However, these preparations weren't enough. The Changyou tribe possesses innate water-controlling abilities.  If a powerful Changyou cultivator passed by, the underwater ambush would be easily detected.</p><p>From the outset, the Golden Toad King, along with several other clan leaders, came to oversee the operation and defuse several crises.</p><p>Now, they are completely secure, as the Dragon King has arrived, and he has broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage!  Unless the Changyou tribe leader arrives personally, they can handle any unexpected event.  Everything is ready.</p><p>"It is said that the Dragon Whale has been in seclusion for thirty years. I wonder if he has broken through."</p><p>On an island, several figures stood beneath a tree, gazing at the Demon Sea.</p><p>The Dragon King and the Golden Toad King were at the front, followed by the leaders of several powerful clans. The current Phoenix King of the Phoenix clan was also present. The Phoenix clan remains the third largest in the Demon Sea, but the Phoenix King’s cultivation is far inferior to the other two, preventing them from being equals.</p><p>It was the Golden Toad King who spoke.</p><p>The Dragon King said calmly, "Perhaps he already broke through and is using this as an excuse to observe. Even if the Dragon Whale has broken through, he won’t take sides. Our own strength is enough to reclaim our ancestral land. Once we succeed, he will inevitably come to us."</p><p>The Golden Toad King laughed, "We haven't heard of any Changyou elders breaking through recently. Even if a new expert emerges, they'll likely be sent to the North Sea first.  It's best if they remain entangled in the North Sea, unable to attend to us. Once we regain our ancestral land, we can defend it under your leadership. It will be a fait accompli, and the humans will have to accept it!"</p><p>The Phoenix King wasn't as optimistic, her brows furrowed. "Won't they be enraged and take it out on our people remaining in Zhongzhou? You left the Western Wasteland garrison to Elder Yuanzhu. He is from the faction in our clan most friendly to humans, and seems to have a close relationship with the Master of the Qingyang Temple. What if he acts unilaterally and sends reinforcements...?"</p><p>The Dragon King waved his hand, interrupting her. "I anticipated Elder Yuanzhu's actions. I deliberately distanced him and those close to humans to prevent leaks. The Changyou tribe will certainly pressure the Western Wasteland while attacking the North Sea.  Even if he wants to reinforce the North Sea, he won't be able to take many soldiers, and it won't change the overall situation!"</p><p>"This will be the beginning of our clan's resurgence! We will settle old scores with them later!" The Golden Toad King was full of ambition, almost impatient.</p><p>The Dragon King nodded slightly, his expression suddenly shifting. He closed his eyes, sensing for a long time, then suddenly laughed, "The Changyou tribe has made their move!"</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>All the demons rejoiced wildly.</p>
