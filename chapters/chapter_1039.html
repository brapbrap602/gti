<h1>Chapter 1031: Treasure Pavilion</h1><p>“Senior Brother! Senior Sister Hong!”</p><p>Su Nu landed, stood on a sand dune, composed herself, and put on a smile.</p><p>“I didn't expect to run into you two first.”</p><p>Two figures landed before Su Nu.</p><p>One was an elderly man with a long beard, one of the two who had first found her in the Glacial Plains.</p><p>The other was a charming woman, appearing to be around thirty, with a graceful figure and exquisite beauty.</p><p>Both of them were full of vitality and composed.</p><p>They were both late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Together, as long as they weren't surrounded by a beast horde, they had little to fear for their safety.</p><p>Compared to them, Su Nu looked much more disheveled.</p><p>She had been determined to reach the Treasure Pavilion before anyone else, exhausting a great deal of her true essence.  Her injuries were merely suppressed with medicinal pills; she hadn't had time to properly treat them.</p><p>Her clothes were scorched in many places, and she looked unkempt.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu's state, both of them were astonished.</p><p>The bearded elder frowned. “Junior Sister, how did you get so badly injured? Did you encounter other cultivators?”</p><p>The injuries Su Nu had sustained in the Glacial Plains had already healed. As long as she focused on self-preservation and waited for the others to arrive, she shouldn't have ended up in such a state.</p><p>The charming woman pinched Su Nu’s cheek and giggled. “Which young master has taken a fancy to our Junior Sister and pursued her relentlessly? I've always said, our Junior Sister is so delicate.  It's fortunate that the Alliance Leader was farsighted enough not to let her go out for training, otherwise those young talents would go crazy.”</p><p>“Junior Sister isn’t cultivating Charm Arts.  We're all cultivators; it's not as indecent as you make it sound.”</p><p>The bearded elder sighed, admonishing the charming woman before turning serious. “Those who have reached the final trial are not to be trifled with.  Junior Sister’s strength is indeed somewhat lacking. Don't forget about Third Junior Brother. His strength was among the top of us, yet he disappeared after entering the trial grounds and hasn't been heard from since.”</p><p>“It's all my fault for having low cultivation and insufficient strength.  These fire spirits happen to counter my techniques, and they can also command ferocious beasts.  Fortunately, Senior Brother and Senior Sister Hong arrived in time, otherwise I really don't know how much longer I could have held on.”</p><p>Su Nu’s cheeks flushed red with shame.</p><p>Indeed, as the charming woman said, she appeared delicate and pitiful. Who would have thought that the Third Junior Brother they spoke of had died at the hands of someone like her?</p><p>“Senior Brother, don't worry. Third Junior Brother is fortunate; he must have encountered some unforeseen delay. However, apart from him, we've all successfully reached the final trial. Once we gather the other Junior Brothers and Sisters, we'll have enough strength to complete Master’s command.”</p><p>The charming woman offered words of comfort.</p><p>Hearing these words, Su Nu’s heart suddenly tightened.</p><p>She knew nothing about the Master’s command that the charming woman mentioned.</p><p>In an instant, Su Nu felt as if she had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p>She had been kept in the dark all along!</p><p>Su Nu clenched her fists, suppressing her unease so as not to be noticed.</p><p>“Senior Brother, did Master have some important task for us? Why wasn’t I informed?”</p><p>Su Nu furrowed her brows, her face full of confusion.</p><p>The charming woman also looked displeased. “Not just you, Junior Sister. I was also completely unaware until Senior Brother told me. Moreover, Senior Brother still refuses to reveal the details, keeping it a complete secret.”</p><p>The bearded elder couldn't withstand their questioning, and said with a wry smile, “It’s not that I intentionally kept it from you, but Master gave strict orders, and I dare not disobey. Before we left, Master repeatedly emphasized the importance of this matter and forbade any leaks, even to you two, just in case. Rest assured, Junior Sisters, once we gather the other disciples, I will explain everything.”</p><p>Seeing that Senior Brother was resolute, the charming woman stopped pressing the issue and said with a chuckle, “Then let's hurry!  I'm curious to see what else in this Trial Realm, besides the Soul Cleansing Liquid, has caught Master's eye.”</p><p>The three of them took flight and continued on their journey.</p><p>“It is said that these places were originally secret realms within the inner hall, transformed into trial grounds by our human ancestors.  It's possible that they contain undiscovered ancient treasures…”</p><p>The bearded elder said as they traveled.</p><p>He looked towards the Treasure Pavilion, paused, and added, “We can't go directly to the Treasure Pavilion. Master said there might be a significant disturbance, which could easily alert others. Let's first find a hidden spot near the pavilion and wait for the other disciples to arrive. Before competing for the Soul Cleansing Liquid, we need to complete this task.”</p><p>Su Nu remained silent, her mind racing.</p><p>Could Master's command be related to her?</p><p>Could this be the source of her unease?</p><p>She was protected between Senior Brother and Senior Sister Hong. Both of them were stronger than her, making it much harder to plot against them as she had done with Third Senior Brother.</p><p>As they neared the Treasure Pavilion, another Senior Brother joined them, and Su Nu knew she had no chance left.</p><p>…</p><p>Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The heart of the Trial Realm, and the end of the entire trial.</p><p>Qin Sang battled his way through the Spirit Water Domain.</p><p>He quickly became adept at handling the Spirit Water Toads' attacks. The domain's water spirits and beasts posed no obstacle to him, making his journey far easier than the others.</p><p>His speed was naturally unmatched.</p><p>After flying for an unknown distance, a mountain silhouette appeared on the horizon, piercing the clouds.  Even from afar, he could see it was the location of the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Finally confirming his destination, Qin Sang smiled slightly and flew straight towards it.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang reached the shore of the water and stepped onto land, getting a clearer view.</p><p>The mountain was extremely steep, a stone peak resembling a stone sword, with only a touch of green in its crevices.</p><p>A white stone staircase spiraled upwards around the mountain, clearly visible from this distance.</p><p>Scattered along the way were stone pavilions and towers, deserted for countless years, exuding an air of loneliness and desolation.</p><p>The staircase reached the summit, leading directly to a prominent pavilion.</p><p>The pavilion was the Treasure Pavilion!</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop a mountain, gazing at the stone peak and surveying his surroundings.  He saw no one.  If nothing unexpected happened, he was likely the first to arrive.</p><p>If he wanted to retrieve treasures from the Treasure Pavilion, he could choose freely. Unfortunately, it wasn't yet time for the Soul Cleansing Liquid to appear.</p><p>He and Ming Wei had agreed to meet at a pavilion on the stone peak.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate, continuing on his journey and soon arriving at the foot of the stone peak.</p><p>The peak was utterly silent, devoid of any human presence.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly ascended the stone stairs, reaching the pavilion where he and Ming Wei had agreed to meet.  Without stopping, he left a mark and continued upwards.</p><p>With ample time, he wanted to take a look at the Treasure Pavilion first.</p><p>He had expected to face some trials on his way to the summit, but unexpectedly, there were no guardian beasts on the peak. Qin Sang easily reached the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>A light barrier, clearly a powerful restriction, blocked the entrance to the pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, observing for a moment, testing cautiously.  Confirming there was no danger and the barrier could be passed freely, he stepped inside.</p>
