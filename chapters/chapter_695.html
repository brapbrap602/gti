<h1>Chapter 687: Following</h1><p>Chapter 687: Following</p><p>Four years of hunting demons.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation has improved significantly.  After forming his Golden Core, he began to inscribe the fifth killing talisman onto his ebony sword, further accelerating his cultivation speed.  It's said that the artificial openings of the Seven Killing Hall are spaced roughly seventy to eighty years apart.  Unless something unexpected happens, he'll have long since broken through to the mid-Golden Core stage before the next opening.</p><p>The factions preparing to break the formation will release information in advance.  Cultivators wishing to enter the Seven Killing Hall will purchase entry qualifications according to the requirements; it's first come, first served.</p><p>Qin Sang will have the Qiongyu Trading Company monitor this to avoid missing the chance to enter the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Besides Qin Sang, the Tianmu Butterfly and the Fat Silkworm are also rapidly improving their cultivation.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly successfully transitioned to the late second transformation three years ago.  Now, it's only a hair's breadth away from its second transformation, and once it reaches peak second transformation, Qin Sang will feed it the Red Fire Gilded Gold to help it break through.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm still has a little less than half of its inner pill remaining, but its cultivation is not far from the mid-second transformation stage.  Qin Sang has also tried giving it the demon pills obtained from hunting, but the Fat Silkworm remains uninterested.</p><p>This is the fifth year since leaving Duyan Island.</p><p>Qin Sang has nearly run out of pills and is starting to think about returning.</p><p>…</p><p>The sky is clear, the sea breeze gentle.</p><p>Yet, on this stretch of water, towering waves rise unexpectedly.</p><p>Amidst the tumultuous waves, a faint green mist swirls. Within the mist, a figure wielding a sword stands facing off against a strange demon beast.</p><p>This person is Qin Sang.  A faint seven-colored halo surrounds him.  It's not very noticeable, but a closer look reveals it, resembling a seven-colored armor.</p><p>The demon beast he confronts is called the Fan Yu Fish, a peak Demon Spirit stage beast.</p><p>In these four years, Qin Sang has encountered many strange demon beasts, and the Fan Yu Fish is one of them. It looks like a headless turtle or tortoise, possessing a carapace and a tail; whiskers adorn its carapace, and its mouth and nose are located on its underside.</p><p>In the Xiao Han region, Qin Sang had never even heard of such a beast.</p><p>Its tail is the most dangerous. The Fan Yu Fish's tail is over ten feet long, segmented like a steel whip. When unleashed, it can instantly shoot out a whiplash several tens of feet long, and like a scorpion's tail, it is venomous.</p><p>The green mist is the poisonous fog released by the Fan Yu Fish, highly toxic.</p><p>Cultivators usually choose to avoid the Fan Yu Fish.  Even Golden Core cultivators are reluctant to provoke it, fearing the consequences of accidental poisoning.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, targets this beast and moves freely within its poisonous mist, thanks to the seven-colored armor. The seven-colored halo released by the Fat Silkworm easily repels the Fan Yu Fish's poisonous mist.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang deliberately stayed in the poisonous mist a little longer to test the Fat Silkworm's abilities, and the Fat Silkworm didn't seem strained at all.</p><p>Thus, even against a Fan Yu Fish at the early stages of the Demon Pill realm, the Fat Silkworm should be able to hold its own for a while.</p><p>Consider that the Fat Silkworm is only in the early second transformation. Once it reaches the late second or even the third transformation, resisting poisonous mist will become incredibly easy.</p><p>Generally, demon beasts skilled in poison have relatively mediocre other abilities.  With the Fat Silkworm, their greatest strength poses no threat to Qin Sang; he can slaughter them at will.</p><p>Qin Sang can now specifically hunt poisonous beasts.</p><p>After circling in the poisonous mist, Qin Sang slays the Fan Yu Fish with a single strike.  He draws the corpse closer, searches it, finds no inner pill, and shows a disappointed expression.</p><p>After skillfully dismembering the corpse, Qin Sang’s sword shadow surrounds his body, transforming into a beam of sword light heading southwest.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang lands on a deserted island.</p><p>The elderly couple and three others are already waiting. The killing intent on them hasn't subsided; a faint smell of blood clings to them, indicating they have also just been through a battle.</p><p>"Senior, this is yours."</p><p>The elder respectfully offers several pieces of beast bone.</p><p>Qin Sang casually accepts them. While pursuing the Fan Yu Fish, he happened upon a demon swarm, which he annihilated, leaving the others to handle the aftermath.</p><p>For these years, the elderly couple and the three others have followed Qin Sang, consistently picking up the leftovers.</p><p>Their discerning eyes had grown accustomed to high-quality materials, scorning the ordinary spirit materials found on the corpses of demonic beasts.  Of course, some of their pouches were simply full.</p><p>"Senior, are we returning to Duoyan Island now?"</p><p>The Wang sisters stepped forward, their voices bright and clear.</p><p>Over the years, they had become familiar with Qin Sang, understanding her to be not unkind, and no longer exhibiting the initial reserve they'd shown.  Yet, they remained unwavering in their obedience to her commands. After witnessing Qin Sang single-handedly slay a demonic beast in the Yao Dan stage, their respect for her had deepened.</p><p>"What? You don't want to go back?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at their pouches, smiling. "Your pouches are full. If we continue hunting, how will you store more?"</p><p>"We'll have to discard the least valuable items,"</p><p>the elder said with a pained expression, then added with a worried tone, "Senior, when do you plan to hunt again?"</p><p>Seeing the group's expressions, Qin Sang understood their thoughts. She said calmly, "Demons are becoming harder to find in this area, and the deeper parts of the Fuhu Sea are too dangerous. I've decided to change locations. After we return, I'll help the trading company with some refining.  It should take at most half a year. If you have anything to do, settle it quickly; I won't wait for you."</p><p>Delighted at the prospect of Qin Sang taking them along again, the five pledged to not delay her.</p><p>Then, they all used their magic tools to fly towards Duoyan Island.</p><p>The journey was uneventful. After half a month, nearing Duoyan Island, they rested on a small island to recover their spiritual energy before continuing.</p><p>Shortly after leaving the small island, Qin Sang suddenly noticed a figure on the horizon to the east.</p><p>Due to the distance, only a dark silhouette was visible, making it impossible to discern their cultivation level.  This person seemed to be heading directly west.</p><p>"Someone."</p><p>The elderly couple and others noticed the figure; the figure had clearly seen them as well.</p><p>Both parties paused simultaneously.</p><p>Anyone daring to travel alone in the Demon Sea must possess considerable strength.</p><p>Moreover, their destinations were different, so they would eventually pass each other.</p><p>"Let's go. Don't mind him."</p><p>Unwilling to cause trouble, Qin Sang said quietly, and continued to fly towards Duoyan Island.</p><p>But the figure's next action caused Qin Sang's expression to darken suddenly.</p><p>As they moved, so did the figure, but instead of continuing west, it abruptly changed direction, stealthily trailing behind them.</p><p>Seeing this, the elderly couple and the others looked flustered, whispering, "Senior, what do we do?"</p><p>Openly following them clearly indicated ill intent.</p><p>Even if this person considered themselves powerful, their proximity to Duoyan Island, where inter-cultivator combat was strictly prohibited, meant they were defying the island's patrols.</p>
