<h1>Chapter 118: Fishing</h1><p>Chapter 118: Fishing</p><p>The cat spirit nodded. "It was my fortune as a child to instinctively absorb the spiritual force of heaven and earth and the essence of the sun and moon. When I began to cultivate, I met a senior bamboo spirit who enlightened me with a drop of Emperor's Fluid, which gave birth to my acquired wisdom and the ability to speak human language."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang suddenly understood. The realms of demonic beasts were divided into the Mortal Demonic Beast Stage, the Demonic Spirit Stage, the Demonic Core Stage, and the Form Transformation Stage.</p><p>The roots and origins of demonic beasts were very complex. Some demonic beasts with strong bloodlines could rival Golden Core Stage cultivators when they matured physically, but their spiritual intelligence might not be as high. Meanwhile, the legendary ancient divine beasts were said to have strength comparable to human powerhouses at birth, with intelligence no less than that of humans, yet they could not transform for a long time.</p><p>Ordinary beasts like this white cat were like mortals; they first developed the instinct to swallow the spiritual force of heaven and earth and then cultivated step by step. The difficulty was no less than that of human cultivators.</p><p>When Mortal Demonic Stage demonic beasts advanced to the Demonic Spirit Stage, they could gradually awaken their spiritual intelligence. However, they still could not get rid of their instincts. After condensing a demonic core and stepping into the Demonic Core Stage, their spiritual intelligence became increasingly higher until they experienced the Form Transformation Tribulation and became a Form Transformation Stage great demonic beast, becoming no different from human cultivators.</p><p>Emperor's Fluid was a divine object that heaven and earth created when demonic beasts experienced the Form Transformation Tribulation. It was recorded that it was shaped like countless olives, with myriad golden threads, penetrating down to earth. When vegetation received its essence, it could transform into a demonic beast.</p><p>It was said that Emperor's Fluid was indispensable for demonic beasts to transform. It also had great benefits for human cultivators and could enlighten ordinary beasts, directly opening up their spiritual intelligence. It was something countless demonic beasts dreamed of.</p><p>The white cat had obtained the enlightenment of Emperor's Fluid by luck, so it was no wonder that its spiritual intelligence was no less than a human's.</p><p>That bamboo spirit casually gave away something like Emperor's Fluid. If it was not a Form Transformation Stage great demonic beast, it must have a significant background.</p><p>Most great demonic beasts in the Minor Cold Domain gathered in the Western Demonic Domain's Celestial Demonic Mound. Could there be great demonic beasts in hiding in the territory of Mount Shaohua, or in the Great Marsh of Yuncang?</p><p>If nothing moved, then nothing would be done, but if something did, it must be extinguished! Qin Sang secretly guarded against the cat spirit and asked in a deep voice, "You and I don't know each other. Who commissioned you? What did they ask you to tell me?"</p><p>The cat spirit did not answer. It nodded at Qin Sang, then waved its green bamboo behind it. A green light flew out and quickly returned with a bundle of over a hundred human figures inside.</p><p>Finally, the green light dropped them in front of Qin Sang, arranging them on the ground. There were teenagers, children, and able-bodied men and women. Their clothes were rough, and their faces were sallow, indicating that they were evidently poor.</p><p>These people were like the young man just now. Their eye sockets were sunken, and their faces were pale. However, they were not as thin, and each of them had their eyes tightly shut, lying on the ground without moving, like rows of corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at them indifferently, his tone cold. "What do you mean? Are you threatening me with these mortals?"</p><p>The cat spirit looked at Qin Sang with sincerity. "They are all villagers from the Black Tiger Ravine at the foot of the mountain. After they were captured up the mountain, not a single one died. Heiwa... oh, my companion, the magic art he cultivates requires blood food, but he has never killed an innocent person. After capturing these villagers, his magic art flared up. He only absorbed some of these mortals' blood and essence. If they are released to recuperate for a period of time, they can recover. His purpose in doing all this is to attract the attention of Gu Tiannan and you, young master. May I ask you, young master, are you a high-level cultivator from the immortal sect behind Gu Tiannan?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly had a premonition after hearing this. However, different races might not be trustworthy. Qin Sang did not answer and said, "Continue speaking."</p><p>"Let me tell you a story, young master," the white cat said.</p><p>Beneath the scorching sun, the air on the mountain was nevertheless chilly. A green light, powerful enough to shake heavens, shrouded the area. From the outside, the green light shook violently, as if there was a great battle going on inside.</p><p>Within the green light, a human and a cat faced each other, with over a hundred unconscious mortals between them.</p><p>The cat spoke, and the human listened.</p><p>There was a young man named Heihu whose parents were both around, and his family was harmonious. He originally lived a peaceful and prosperous life in a small mountain village. However, one day, calamity struck, and his entire family was killed by a fiend. The entire village became a living hell, and he was the only one who managed to escape with his life, becoming an orphan.</p><p>Later, he joined a martial artist's sect, learned martial arts, and made a name for himself on the江湖. However, he never forgot his hatred for the fiend.</p><p>He traveled around the Ancient Abyss Country, wanting to find the fiend and avenge his family. However, he obtained a legendary immortal book, and only after cultivating it did he realize that this magic art required the devouring of mortals' souls, treating them as blood food.</p><p>The boy suddenly realized that the one who murdered his family was most likely the same person who cultivated the evil technique. He began to trace the clues and finally found that, in the past decades, similar tragedies had happened in several nearby small countries, not just in Country Gu Yuan. And it also led him to the posthumous remains of a practitioner of the evil technique.</p><p>Based on the last words found in the cave, he finally found out that it was Gu Tian Nan...</p><p>The white cat spoke quickly and simply, as if it was in a hurry.</p><p>"He knew that he was no match for Gu Tian Nan, and he had already become a devil. Even though he found other immortal cultivators, people wouldn’t believe him without any evidence. Therefore, he decided to sacrifice himself for revenge."</p><p>Upon hearing this story, the first thing that popped into Qin Sang’s mind was entrapment.</p><p>The information revealed by the white cat shocked Qin Sang.</p><p>"Gu Tian Nan has a cultivation base at the 13th Layer of Qi Refining Period?"</p><p>He had known Gu Tian Nan for so long, yet he didn’t notice anything.</p><p>The white cat said, "Yes, and his disciple’s cultivation base is no weaker than yours. If it weren't for this green bamboo left by the senior demon bamboo, we would have been killed by them already. Last time, Hei Wa decided to avenge himself personally, only to find out Gu Tian Nan's real strength and was badly injured. Although I rescued him, his injury was too severe. Even if he doesn’t die this time, he won't live much longer."</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t care about that, "He lures others into cultivating the evil technique and then devours them to get such a high cultivation base?"</p><p>The white cat nodded, "As far as we know, that is the case."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he lowered his head in contemplation for a while before asking, "What's your relationship with Hei Wa? Why do you want to help him? Do you think I'll suspect my fellow sect apprentice to be the mastermind just based on your one-sided story?"</p><p>The white cat said, "I had a connection with his ancestor, and I have my own reasons for promising to help him. I know that you won't believe me. If you are willing to come with me, you will be able to witness the truth. Time... is running out."</p><p>The white cat stepped out of the azure light and looked back at Qin Sang, waiting for his decision.</p><p>Qin Sang had long been suspicious of Gu Tian Nan, and after hearing this story, he actually believed 70-80% of it. However, hearing is not as good as seeing.</p><p>The azure light remained in place as a cover, pretending to be in the middle of a fierce battle. Qin Sang urged his Luo Yun Wings, and the white cat also concealed its figure. They flew towards the deep mountains one after another.</p><p>"We're there!"</p><p>Just as they were about to cross a mountain, the white cat suddenly stopped and made mouth shapes to Qin Sang.</p>
