<h1>Chapter 389: A Long-Lost Acquaintance</h1><p>In his letter, Wushang explained that all his attempts were made after his transformation into a Skyfiend Night Devil. Even then, he couldn't undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, forcing him into the path of necromancy.</p><p>What would happen to a Corpse Core if someone, unafraid of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman's soul-binding effect, achieved the Skyfiend Night Devil transformation and *then* removed the talisman, breaking free from necromancy?</p><p>Would… their cultivation regress?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then shook his head.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang directed the animated corpse to bow to 'Wushang'.</p><p>Wushang was the second person Qin Sang had met, after Wanderer, whose pursuit of the Dao was so unwavering and indomitable.  He ultimately became a Skyfiend Night Devil, losing his sanity, his soul eternally trapped within the refined corpse, wandering a desolate ice cave without regret.</p><p>No obsession, no enlightenment!</p><p>Truly deserving of the title 'Dao Seeker'.</p><p>Coincidentally, both Wanderer and Wushang were drawn to this place by the Midnight Lily, their paths converging despite their different origins.</p><p>One might not like such individuals, but their dedication commands respect.</p><p>The animated corpse slowly retreated from the chamber, glancing back at 'Wushang'.</p><p>Sensing the corpse's movement, 'Wushang', sitting cross-legged on the ice, looked up, his dark eyes filled with coldness before closing them once more, returning to stillness.</p><p>Only a solitary figure remained in the dim blue light.</p><p>The corpse returned to Qin Sang's side.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his Corpse Puppet Sack and stored the corpse.  His own injuries had mostly healed. Once he placed Wanderer inside, his mission would be complete, and he could leave for Azure Sun Market to await the outcome.</p><p>From Wushang's letter, Qin Sang learned that the Midnight Lily grew here, a heavenly treasure capable of purifying the soul and nourishing the spirit.</p><p>He hoped that Wanderer would benefit from this herb and recover from his hidden injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang then summoned the Ebony Sword, the Ten Yama Banners, and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>He relied on these three treasures to contend with the Skyfiend Night Devil.</p><p>The Flood Dragon's spirit remained unharmed, and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman was intact.</p><p>The Ebony Sword, having taken a direct blow, had lost some of its luster. Qin Sang carefully examined it with his divine sense, finding no damage.  It simply needed to be nurtured within his soul to recover.</p><p>The most heavily used, and potentially most damaged, item was the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>The Yin threads were forcibly torn apart by the Skyfiend Night Devil, and the main soul was directly shattered by a punch. Qin Sang hadn't had time to check its condition.</p><p>Qin Sang unfurled the Ten Yama Banners and examined them, letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p>The formation was even more resilient than he'd thought. After the battle, the main soul had indeed weakened, but with countless souls within the banner, it had retreated to recuperate and was now fully restored.</p><p>Truly a treasure derived from a Nascent Soul magic item.</p><p>Qin Sang praised it silently, storing each item away.  He glanced back at the empty ice hall, then vanished, streaking outwards.</p><p>A thoughtful expression remained on Qin Sang's face as he sped along.</p><p>Not long after, as he neared the deep pool where the Horned Fish Dragons resided, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, gazing ahead with apprehension.</p><p>Faint thunderclaps and sharp shrieks echoed from ahead.</p><p>This was deep within the ice plains, the ice layer thousands of feet thick. No ordinary lightning could penetrate here. The only possibility was that the lightning originated from the Horned Fish Dragons' horns.</p><p>Were they… playing?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, regretting not asking Wanderer more about the Horned Fish Dragons' habits.</p><p>These ancient beasts possessed powerful innate abilities. Even their play couldn't be taken lightly. Approaching now might put him at risk.</p><p>It was best to wait until they calmed down before releasing the Intoxicating Demon Saliva.</p><p>The closer he got, the deeper Qin Sang's frown became.  The Horned Fish Dragons' commotion was excessively intense. The sounds were fierce, the surrounding spiritual energy chaotic, and the ice cave trembled.</p><p>Could they be fighting other ancient beasts?</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang.  The deep pool was bottomless and might harbor other ancient beasts besides the Horned Fish Dragons.</p><p>It wasn't that he hadn't considered other intruders, but this place was too remote. Reaching it required passing through the inner valley's restrictions, avoiding countless dangerous traps, finding this location, and breaking the illusion.</p><p>Wanderer had said that no one had come here since his last visit. It was unlikely they'd run into someone else so coincidentally.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang slowed down.</p><p>The Horned Fish Dragons' senses were keen. He didn't dare expose his divine sense, lest he attract unwanted attention. Instead, he concealed himself, retrieved his magical items, and quietly approached the deep pool.</p><p>Rounding a corner and seeing the pool at the end of the passage, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. His assumptions were wrong.  Someone *was* there!</p><p>Before he could get a clear look, a warning flared in his mind.  He stomped his foot and flashed to the other side of the passage.</p><p>At the same moment, a blinding bolt of lightning shot from the pool, striking where he'd just stood. It blasted a large hole in the incredibly hard black ice, spiderweb cracks spreading outwards.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the hole, his face grim. He hadn't expected to be discovered and forced out of hiding so quickly.</p><p>He had been cautious and constantly used the Spirit Concealment Technique. How had they detected him?</p><p>Unless… their cultivation far surpassed his, rendering the Spirit Concealment Technique useless.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The other party launched another lightning bolt without a word.</p><p>Having witnessed its power, Qin Sang dared not face it head-on.  He dodged, but as he moved, the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu on his soul stirred, snapping its fangs at his soul, only to be blocked by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>The Heart-Devouring Insect!</p><p>The Kuiyin Sect!</p><p>The realization flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Instinctively, he let out a cry, staggering forward as if using all his strength to narrowly avoid the lightning bolt under the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu's assault.</p><p>He then heard the other person let out a surprised sound, a voice that seemed familiar.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>“Huh? Qin Sang? You're still alive?”</p><p>“Yu Hua!”</p><p>Seeing the face beneath the conical hat, distant memories flooded back. Qin Sang recognized him instantly, gritting his teeth as he spoke the name, his heart filled with shock.</p><p>Yu Hua was still alive!</p><p>It was Yu Hua!</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect traitor, the Foundation Establishment cultivator who controlled them alongside Zhao Yan!</p><p>On the night of the Kuiyin Sect's attack, the Yuanzhao Sect's leader had detonated the sect's protective formation and spiritual veins, perishing alongside the Kuiyin Sect's higher-ups. Yu Hua, acting as an inside agent, had somehow survived.</p><p>Moreover, Yu Hua was no longer the ordinary cultivator who had just broken through to Foundation Establishment decades ago.</p><p>His cultivation was astonishingly high, his aura no weaker than Senior Brother Qi Yuanhun's – False Core Realm!</p>
