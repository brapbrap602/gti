<h1>Chapter 429: The Bloody Man</h1><p>Chapter 429: The Bloody Man</p><p>An elderly man sat in a stone room.</p><p>He didn't conceal his identity; in fact, in the entire trading fair, those like Qin Sang, completely covered from head to toe, were in the minority.</p><p>The old man's hair and beard were completely white, his appearance amiable. Seeing Qin Sang enter, he immediately rose and asked, "Welcome, Daoist friend.  What might you wish to purchase?"</p><p>The old man's stone room appeared empty, but this was merely an illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang sat before the old man, opening his palm to reveal a token.</p><p>This token was the insignia of the Tian Ge building.</p><p>"I have come for the items I ordered last time."</p><p>"Ah, Daoist Qingfeng!"</p><p>The old man's face lit up, then a cautious expression appeared. He waved his hand, opening the room's protective barrier before retrieving a pouch from behind.  He took out two jade bottles and handed them to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Daoist, please examine these. Are these the quality of elixirs you require?"</p><p>Qin Sang opened the bottles; the fragrance of the pills was striking—precisely the essence-cultivating elixirs he needed, though of slightly inferior quality to the Gathering Spirit Pills.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, then produced a spirit sword, giving it to the old man.</p><p>"This is the spirit sword I ordered. Please inspect it."</p><p>This sword, infused with cold iron, was a loss for Qin Sang in exchange for these two bottles of medicine.  However, with the current instability, he couldn't afford to be too particular.</p><p>He had been saving these spirit swords, intending to sell them for a higher price at a more opportune moment.</p><p>Now, most of them were exchanged for medicine, the efficacy of which was only so-so.  Qin Sang endured this, understanding that improving his strength was paramount; reaching the False Core stage before the chaos would be ideal.</p><p>After the old man confirmed the transaction, Qin Sang put away the elixirs and prepared to leave.</p><p>The old man hastily rose. "Daoist, please wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone tightened. "Is there something else, friend? Are you dissatisfied with the sword?"</p><p>"No, no..."</p><p>The old man waved his hands repeatedly. "Daoist, please don't misunderstand. I'm conveying a message from above. Your sword-making skills are exquisite; it would be a pity to abandon them.  Would you consider undertaking another commission?  We can deliver the materials here; you simply focus on forging, with the same compensation as before."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent for a moment, then shook his head.  "I've already devoted considerable time to refining, neglecting my cultivation. I must prioritize my practice now and haven't the time to take on any forging commissions. However, once my cultivation improves and I'm not so pressed for time, I will resume forging. My collaboration with your Tian Ge building has been satisfactory; I will contact you then."</p><p>His words were sincere.  His focus on refining had slowed his cultivation; without the Blood Droplet Mushroom, his progress would have been even slower.</p><p>At least, until reaching the False Core stage, Qin Sang had no intention of returning to sword forging.</p><p>The old man's face brightened at Qin Sang's reply and ceased pressing further. He bowed respectfully. "Then we eagerly await good news from the Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and left the stone room.</p><p>Several more people had entered the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing there was still time, patiently browsed the hall. He found some interesting treasures, but they were far too expensive to justify the cost.</p><p>After a cursory look, he was about to leave for his medicinal garden when he heard a loud "bang."</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The hall fell instantly silent. Everyone's faces changed; all eyes turned towards the source of the noise.</p><p>The door to the stone room at the hall entrance was violently flung open by a blood-soaked figure who collapsed to the ground, curling into a fetal position and groaning in pain.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the gatekeeper, wearing a tiger-head mask, rushed out.</p><p>Seeing this, those at the trading fair assumed the man had forcefully entered and offended the guard, leading to the beating.  Their gazes towards the gatekeeper were filled with awe.</p><p>The bloody man was gravely injured, his breath weak, but his cultivation was undeniable – a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p>A late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, beaten to such a state by a gatekeeper, without warning—the fight must have been extremely swift. The gatekeeper's strength far surpassed expectations.</p><p>The onlookers were astonished.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the bloody man struggled to his feet, shouting hoarsely, "The Tianxing League is attacking in force, slaughtering everyone! Go… go for help…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, he fainted, collapsing to the ground.  He had pushed himself to his absolute limit.</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"The Tianxing League is attacking!"</p><p>"Impossible! There was no warning!"</p><p>…</p><p>The hall erupted in an uproar at the bloody man's words.</p><p>The attendees were caught completely off guard.  Nobody anticipated a sudden attack by the Tianxing League. Though the trading fair was secluded, the bloody man's appearance indicated the battlefield was nearby, and they would surely be affected.</p><p>Even though dozens of Foundation Establishment cultivators were gathered at the trade fair, if the Tianxing Alliance launched a full-scale attack on Xiao Han Domain, they wouldn't send only Foundation Establishment cultivators.  How could everyone not be alarmed?</p><p>Just then, the gatekeeper rushed to the bleeding man's side, lifted him up, and loudly announced, "It's not necessarily an attack by the Tianxing Alliance. There might be another explanation.  Everyone, please remain calm..."</p><p>Saying this, the gatekeeper's figure flickered, rushing to a stone house before shouting, "Help!"</p><p>A middle-aged woman in palace attire hurried out of the stone house.  She knelt beside the bleeding man, examined him, and then took a pill from a pouch, feeding it to him.</p><p>Simultaneously, the woman extended her hand, tapping the man several times, injecting subtle spiritual energy into his body.</p><p>With the pill and the woman's mysterious technique, the man's breathing quickly stabilized.</p><p>The crowd suppressed their unease, watching the woman's actions with apprehension, hoping the medicine would take effect quickly and the man would awaken, explaining the situation.</p><p>No one dared to leave.  They didn't know the direction of the Tianxing Alliance army; if they ran into them, it would be a death sentence!</p><p>Qin Sang, hidden in the crowd, felt his heart leap. He didn't know whether this was good fortune or misfortune.</p><p>Although encountering this accident was unexpected, it allowed him to learn of the change beforehand, which might not be a bad thing. Otherwise, if he found out too late while in the medicinal garden, he might be caught in a trap.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, subtly shifting his position to approach the stone house door, preparing to leave immediately after learning the situation.</p><p>He already had the Ten Directions Yama Banner clasped in his palm, and his ebony sword was secretly prepared.</p><p>He didn't plan to stay with these people.  Traveling together as a large group would be too conspicuous.  He carried valuable treasures, and as long as he remained low-key and avoided the attention of the Tianxing Alliance's Golden Core cultivators, escaping would not be difficult.</p><p>The question was, how large-scale was this Tianxing Alliance attack?</p><p>At this moment, time seemed to stretch infinitely. Everyone watched the bleeding man with intense anxiety.</p><p>After the woman's treatment, she was drenched in sweat. After a moment, she exclaimed joyfully, "He's awake!"</p>
