<h1>Chapter 1160: An Unexpected Turn</h1><p>Seeing that Qin Sang wasn't there for vengeance, the Yuanzhao Sect Master breathed a sigh of relief.  He dared not hide anything from Qin Sang, replying honestly: "Senior, when we were attacked by the Kuiyin Sect, we suffered heavy losses. The reason we were able to counterattack was due to the intervention of the Wuji Sect disciples. After breaching the Kuiyin Sect's protective formation, most of the Kuiyin Sect's treasures fell into the hands of the Wuji Sect disciples."</p><p>"Were all of Kuiyin Ancestor's famed Ten Directions Yama Banner taken by the Wuji Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>It was for the Ten Directions Yama Banner...</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master hadn't expected that someone would still be interested in this matter after so long. He remained calm, a thoughtful expression on his face, saying as he considered, "After we jointly killed Kuiyin Sect's Sect Master Yi Tiannie, we found a Ten Directions Yama Banner among his belongings. It was taken by Ying Jiansheng of the Wuji Sect. Another Golden Core cultivator died by Ying Jiansheng's sword; whether he possessed a Ten Directions Yama Banner, we don't know. Another Golden Core cultivator, during our breaching of the formation, used a trick to escape with his soul, and remains untraceable... It's said that Ying Jiansheng later found some damaged Ten Directions Yama Banners, which he also took back to the Wuji Sect."</p><p>It was just as Qin Sang expected; since the Wuji Sect interfered, they certainly wouldn't leave the good things for the Yuanzhao Sect. This was going to be difficult.</p><p>The Wuji Sect was destroyed over a hundred years ago, its disciples either dead or scattered.  The Wuji Sect's collection was divided among various factions, and it was unknown who had the banner. Even if found, attempting to exchange for it would certainly lead to exorbitant demands.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then continued, "After the Wuji Sect's destruction, was Ying Jiansheng also implicated?"</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master nodded, "Legend says that on the night of the Wuji Sect's destruction, all the Sect Master's direct disciples were killed, none escaping, including Ying Jiansheng."</p><p>"So, your Yuanzhao Sect didn't get even one Yama Banner?" Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, his tone suddenly colder.</p><p>He clearly remembered.  At the foot of Yuanzhao Peak, Zhao Yan had used a demonic banner to trap the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid cultivators guarding it. After killing Zhao Yan, Qin Sang hadn't dared to touch the banner, leaving it there.  The demonic banner must have fallen into the Yuanzhao Sect's hands, yet the Sect Master hadn't mentioned it.  If he dared to deceive him, Qin Sang wouldn't mind using some methods.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master's heart skipped a beat; feeling apprehensive, he hurriedly said, "I haven't finished. Yi Tiannie sent someone with a demonic banner to infiltrate the Yuanzhao Sect, and it was obtained by our disciples, but wasn't given to the Wuji Sect. However, I don't have this banner; it was later taken by a senior cultivator."</p><p>"Who?" Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master looked embarrassed, shaking his head. "I don't know the senior's background. After the Wuji Sect's destruction, she came to ask for the banner, promising to protect the Yuanzhao Sect from being implicated. My cultivation is low, and I've never seen her since, and still don't know her identity."</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. "Wasn't this person from a righteous sect? Do you remember their appearance?"</p><p>"The senior was a female cultivator, wearing a red dress..." the Yuanzhao Sect Master described.</p><p>The more Qin Sang heard, the more surprised he became. The person the Yuanzhao Sect Master described was actually his Senior Sister Qing Jun!</p><p>It wasn't strange that the Yuanzhao Sect Master hadn't heard of Qing Jun; very few people knew her true identity. For years, she had been traveling under the guise of Leng Yuntian.</p><p>"So, the other demonic banners are also in Senior Sister Qing Jun's hands? What is she collecting them for? Did she hear rumors of Kuiyin Ancestor and covet the power of this set of banners?" Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>If it was Senior Sister Qing Jun, things would be much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Yuanzhao Sect Master, asked a few more questions, which the Sect Master answered one by one. Seeing that he was very honest and hadn't hidden anything, Qin Sang didn't press him further. After getting the answers, he rose into the air and flew towards his next target, the Moyan Sect.</p><p>He didn't dwell on Senior Sister Qing Jun's motives for long. He would ask her in person next time they met.  What interested him was Senior Sister Qing Jun's cultivation level. The time of the Wuji Sect's destruction was clear.</p><p>After the Purple Micro Palace was sealed, the Xiaohan Domain experts immediately attacked the Wuji Gate.  It was around that time that Senior Sister Qingjun approached the Yuanzhao Gate.</p><p>Before entering the Purple Micro Palace, Senior Sister Qingjun had him use the Blood-Soiled Divine Light to assist her in dealing with Leng Yuntian.  Upon exiting, she immediately became a Nascent Soul Grandmaster.</p><p>The speed of her breakthrough was astonishing.</p><p>Could she have undergone a Heavenly Tribulation inside the Purple Micro Palace?</p><p>Qin Sang always felt something was amiss with Senior Sister Qingjun; her cultivation level and actual strength seemed contradictory. Her extraordinary beauty, yet disguised as Old Woman Jing, was even more peculiar.</p><p>Now, his suspicions are confirmed.</p><p>Qin Sang suspects that Senior Sister Qingjun had already formed her Nascent Soul before entering the Purple Micro Palace, but for some reason, her cultivation was suppressed, preventing her from unleashing her full power. After eliminating Leng Yuntian, she found a way to lift the restriction within the Purple Micro Palace, her cultivation restored, and she instantly became a top-tier expert, even causing the Red-Haired Ancestor to fear her and tacitly allowing her to seize control of the Yuanshen Gate.</p><p>"Considering all this, Senior Sister Qingjun's cultivation speed is truly remarkable. Her talent is probably no less than Chen Yan's.  Remember, one of her parents disappeared, the other passed away early, and she carries a deep blood feud, never joining any sect; her situation was no better than a loose cultivator. Chen Yan, supported by Duke Dongyang and Mount Shaohua, still had to use demonic arts to forcibly form her Nascent Soul."</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more he felt Senior Sister Qingjun was extraordinary.</p><p>Unlike him, they didn't have the convenience of cultivation techniques without bottlenecks in the minor realms.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang sped along, making almost no stops, entering the Tian Duan Mountain range.</p><p>Upon arrival, he had reached the territory of the Demon Path.</p><p>Intending to secretly investigate the Qingyang Demon Sect, Qin Sang maintained a low profile.  With his cultivation, ordinary people couldn't see through his disguise.</p><p>With a great war looming, cultivators were being deployed to the front lines, leaving these market towns noticeably deserted and sparsely populated.</p><p>Qin Sang first visited Tianyou Pass, a major Demon cultivator city, gathering some information before traveling south.  He proceeded in this manner until he reached the vicinity of the Moyan Gate.</p><p>A desolate mountain peak.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared silently, turning the Qianjun Ring in his hand, gazing towards the Moyan Gate.</p><p>The Moyan Gate's mountain gate remained in its original location, not having relocated.</p><p>"Although the Moyan Gate is located in Demon Path territory, its cultivation methods actually involve absorbing geothermal energy, not demonic arts. If the sect's ethos is acceptable, accepting them wouldn't be amiss..."</p><p>******</p>
