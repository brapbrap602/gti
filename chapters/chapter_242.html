**Chapter 235: Harvest**

Qin Sang could not climb any further despite circulating his spiritual energy with full force, indicating some unknown spiritual energy preventing participants from leaving the top.

The fog still did not show any sign of thinning, and Qin Sang was merely testing his theory and verifying his thoughts. When he began descending slowly, he noticed the chains continued downward without stopping.

He faced no obstacles during his descent, gliding amidst flocks of firebirds while estimating that the number of firebirds in this space must be terrifyingly large.

He suddenly halted his descent as he broke through the fog and saw a new chain below him!

Indeed! Qin Sang thought to himself. The participants in the trial were likely all within this space, and if there were enough of them, they would definitely run into each other. However, his purpose was not to find the others, so after a brief pause, Qin Sang accelerated his descent.

The red line grew brighter and brighter, even becoming somewhat dazzling.

Qin Sang encountered several more chains along the way, dozens in total. Not knowing how high they had descended, the magma river in Qin Sang's field of vision grew increasingly clear and wide.

He discovered that this space had boundaries after all. There were high cliffs on both sides, revealing that the trial space was actually a canyon.

However, the canyon was so vast that the cliffs could not be seen from above, giving the impression of an infinite space. The further they descended, the narrower the canyon became until, at the very bottom, there was a surging magma river.

The magma river was extraordinarily wide and not calm. The magma churned and surged, creating towering crimson waves.

Contrary to Qin Sang's expectations, this was not the source of the magma river. The magma flowed out of the ruins of an ancient cultivator and onward to some unknown destination.

"Huh?"

Qin Sang encountered resistance and was blocked by an invisible barrier when he reached the magma river and could see the entirety of the magma sea.

Qin Sang was perplexed. He looked down at the space beneath his feet, but everything in the void seemed normal. No physical barriers were visible to the naked eye. Furthermore, the fire energy from the magma river could ignore the restrictions.

Waves like these could be seen everywhere. A wave just happened to crash in front of Qin Sang. The magma was blocked by the barrier, but a stream of incredibly refined fire spiritual energy surged out of the restriction with an intensity comparable to the magma.

The surge of fire spiritual energy dissipated after exhausting its strength, becoming balls of fiery essence that merged into the fog. Over time, they might transform into new firebirds.

After a moment of contemplation, a spiritual energy light flashed beneath Qin Sang's feet, and the invisible barrier that had been triggered by the spiritual energy finally appeared.

Countless runes formed one profound circular restriction after another, overlapping with each other and extending all the way into the depths of the magma river, as far as the eye could see. Qin Sang certainly did not see the entire restriction.

It was hard to imagine how strong the owner of the ancient immortal ruins was to leave behind such a massive scale of restrictions, covering the entire magma river.

The restriction's light was extremely dim, and there were even cracks on it, indicating that most of its power had been worn away over the tens of thousands of years. It was still quite sturdy, however, and not something Qin Sang could break.

His attempt proved futile.

Once again, Qin Sang was surrounded by firebirds attracted by the spiritual energy fluctuations. He concealed himself to get rid of the birds, and his figure flickered as he moved to the edge of the restriction and approached the stone wall.

The stone wall converged inward in an arc from top to bottom. It was not smooth but rugged and uneven.

Qin Sang walked up to the stone wall and scanned it with his eyes. A moment later, his eyes lit up as he rushed over to a stone crevice and plucked a small, pale-white object from it.

It was a skull fragment!

Firebirds turned into flames upon death and left nothing behind. This skull was clearly human.

Qin Sang's confidence soared after finding this bone fragment. He immediately began searching diligently. However, after searching for a while, Qin Sang stopped and frowned.

There were not as many treasures on the stone wall as he had imagined. He only found one skull fragment after searching for quite some time. This suggested that most of the trial participants had either been torn to pieces by firebirds or incinerated by fire energy surging out of the restriction.

After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang suddenly unleashed his divine consciousness, expanding it to its maximum limit and instantly scanning a large area. The divine consciousness immediately alerted flocks of firebirds, who quickly swarmed around Qin Sang.

When Phoenix Monster reached a certain level, Qin Sang felt the danger. He retracted his consciousness and concealed himself, waiting for them to disperse before releasing his consciousness again. 

In this way, the speed greatly improved, and Qin Sang searched all the way forward along this cliff from the very beginning. 

After a while, Qin Sang stopped and stood on a rock, gazing at the mist in front. He could not go any further here as a gentle force pushed him back. He realized that this was the end of the first test and that he needed to follow the iron chain to find the exit. 

Since he had to pay attention to searching the cliff, his speed was not fast. If he concentrated on flying away, he would have been able to pass the test in only a quarter of an hour. 

Qin Sang then went to the other side of the cliff and searched toward the way he had come. 

After searching both sides of the cliff, Qin Sang flew up and found a nearby stone platform. Forty-odd rays of light flew out of his mustard seed bag and were placed in front of him. 

The rays of light contained all kinds of magic weapons. Most of them were of the demonic cultivation style. 

These were all Qin Sang’s gains. Originally, he thought he would return empty-handed. Finding so many magic weapons was an unexpected surprise. In addition to these, there were also three mustard seed bags. 

Qin Sang opened the mustard seed bags first. He saw that the spiritual things, spiritual pills, and similar items in them could no longer be used, as their spirituality dissipated because they lacked sealing prohibition. 

Apart from a few spirit stones, the several magic weapons were also useless. 

Qin Sang turned to the magic weapons before him, waved his hand to remove most of them, discarded them, and threw them away. These were damaged magic weapons, and like the items in the mustard seed bags, their power had dissipated, leaving them as useless scrap metal of no value. 

There were nine perfect magic weapons left, whose grades were high and low and could still be used normally. Qin Sang took them over and examined them one by one. A hint of joy suddenly appeared on his face, and he reached out to take three of them. 

There were a black gourd, a pale long banner, and a bone flute. 

These three were soul-refining magical artifacts! 

The long banner was the worst. Qin Sang summoned the Ten Directions閻羅 Banner with a glance and let it devour the banner. 

The other two artifacts were hard to evaluate in terms of their grades. The effect of the black gourd was to absorb the opponent into it, use the refined souls in the gourd to slay the opponent, and refine it into blood. The bone flute could make a ghostly scream to affect the opponent's state of mind. 

The number of refined souls in these two artifacts was shocking. They must have been natal magical artifacts carefully refined by demonic cultivators!
