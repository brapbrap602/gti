<h1>Chapter 1093: Peach Blossoms</h1><p>"This..."</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze inward, observing the gray energy within his dantian. The gray energy, which had always remained docile within him, turned out to be the spirit of the spirit sword. Moreover, it was far from being obedient. It had taken advantage of his unconscious state to stir up trouble.</p><p>"I'm not sure if the sword spirit has truly acknowledged you as its master. You should be cautious from now on. However, this might not be a bad thing. Once the sword spirit awakens, you'll be able to easily locate the other fragments of the spirit sword and gather this world-shaking cultivation technique!"</p><p>Qingzhu sighed deeply.</p><p>He had held on until now to help Qin Sang retrieve this cultivation technique, guiding the younger generation.</p><p>The immortal path he had left unfinished would now be continued by Qin Sang, and there was great hope for success!</p><p>Qin Sang struggled to process all this information, unsure whether to feel excitement or relief.</p><p>But he still had one lingering doubt.</p><p>The sword spirit had entered his body before the teleportation. When exactly had it happened?</p><p>It definitely wasn't in the Sword Path Hall where the ancient teleportation array was located. Otherwise, Qingzhu, who also cultivated the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture," would have been recognized by the sword spirit as its master, not Qin Sang, who came later.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled the moment when he was forcibly taken into the bronze hall by Dongyang Bo, the place where his master, Chenyan, had disappeared. It was there that Dongyang Bo had used him to threaten Chenyan.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang was certain there had been no abnormalities in his body. The sword spirit couldn't have silently infiltrated him.</p><p>Only during that time had Qin Sang's entire body been sealed by Dongyang Bo's restrictive talismans.</p><p>Could the sword spirit have been hiding in that bronze hall all along, waiting for someone who cultivated the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture" to silently enter their body?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more plausible it seemed.</p><p>When Qingzhu heard Qin Sang's account, he pondered for a moment and said, "It's possible! The Seven Slaughter Palace and the Purple Star Palace are both deeply connected to the 'Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture' and the fragments of the spirit sword... Unfortunately, I cannot accompany you. You'll have to explore these mysteries on your own in the future."</p><p>Qingzhu patted Qin Sang's shoulder and briefly recounted what had happened afterward.</p><p>"After sending you and the sword spirit away, I intended to retrieve the spirit sword fragments and the cultivation technique. However, the demon soul grew suspicious and began searching the Sword Energy Hall relentlessly, refusing to leave. If I had forcibly broken the restrictions, the commotion would have alerted the demon soul, and I was no match for him at the time. Before I could retrieve the spirit sword fragments, I would have fallen into his hands. This stalemate continued until the Seven Slaughter Palace closed, forcing me to abandon my plan and leave the inner hall."</p><p>"After leaving, I searched the two great seas for traces of the demon soul and discovered that as the demon soul's cultivation increased, the seal began to loosen. Moreover, the demon soul frequently changed identities, seemingly plotting something. Before the inner hall could reappear, the seal would be broken, and I had to find a way to counterattack."</p><p>"Later, when the Witch Clan opened the outer hall for the first time, I left a jade slip in the Sword Path to lure the demon soul to the Spirit Turtle Island. At the same time, I misled the demon soul into believing that his true identity was my sword spirit, preventing him from devouring me first."</p><p>"By actively drawing the demon soul into my body and personally controlling the spirit sword fragment, the seal indeed stabilized."</p><p>"Before this, I sent my sword spirit avatar to the Heavenly Dao Sect. If the avatar failed to break through, I planned to use the Earth Blood Ginseng to form an external Dao Nascent Soul and retrieve another spirit sword fragment. With the power of two fragments, I could re-seal the demon soul."</p><p>"However, the situation turned out to be far more complicated than I had imagined. The demon soul attempted to release the ancient demon, causing chaos throughout the cultivation world and inciting conflicts among various factions. I could only watch helplessly, unable to act. When the Witch Clan opened the Seven Slaughter Palace for the second time, I intended to send a message through you, but the demon soul intervened. What followed were the events at Yitian Peak..."</p><p>After listening to Qingzhu's story, Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>He hadn't expected that Senior Qingzhu had experienced so many twists and turns, far surpassing his own trials.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Qin Sang softly asked, "Senior... is there anything you'd like me to convey to others?"</p><p>Though it was a harsh question, Qin Sang had to ask. He could sense that Qingzhu's condition was deteriorating.</p><p>"Do not grieve for me! After my death, simply return my body. They have waited for me for many years, and we can finally reunite in the afterlife. As for Qingjun, there's no need to disturb her..."</p><p>Qingzhu shook his head, "To her, I failed in my duties. I am merely her birth father, nothing more."</p><p>Qingzhu walked to the edge of the Nether Valley and gazed into the distance for a long time. Suddenly, he turned and asked Qin Sang, "Having devoted yourself to the elusive path of immortality, have you ever regretted it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback but shook his head without hesitation.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qingzhu praised.</p><p>He stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze distant, as if looking at something far beyond. There was a hint of nostalgia and reminiscence in his eyes.</p><p>"Do you remember the Red Jade Peach?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Of course, he remembered. The Red Jade Peach at the Sword Gate Pass of Shaohua Mountain was sweeter than any spiritual fruit. It was from that time that he first heard of Senior Qingzhu's legends, and now he was witnessing the end of that legend.</p><p>"It's been many years since I last tasted it."</p><p>Qingzhu murmured.</p><p>He had searched everywhere for peach seeds, hoping to cultivate Red Jade Peaches on Spirit Turtle Island, but they never matched the taste of his memories.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and quickly rummaged through his Qianjun Ring. To his surprise, he found a few peach pits.</p><p>Back then, he had wanted to plant Red Jade Peaches in his cave, so he had collected a few and kept them until now.</p><p>Qin Sang planted the peach pits in the soil platform and asked Qingzhu to infuse them with the vitality of the Three Light Jade Liquid.</p><p>The peach pits took root, sprouted, grew branches, and unfurled leaves, rapidly transforming into a peach tree before their eyes.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>The peach blossoms bloomed!</p><p>The fragrance of flowers filled the valley.</p><p>Soon, the blossoms fell, and green fruits appeared, gradually turning red under the rosy light of dawn, eventually ripening into Red Jade Peaches!</p><p>The tree was heavy with fruit!</p><p>The peaches were a vibrant red, utterly captivating!</p><p>Such a miracle could only occur in the cultivation world.</p><p>The peach tree continued to grow new branches, lush and full, with peach blossoms continuously blooming.</p><p>Qingzhu stopped infusing vitality and stared at the peach tree, his gaze soft. He nodded to Qin Sang and gently plucked a Red Jade Peach.</p><p>Taking a bite, Qingzhu savored it carefully and sighed, "After all, it's a fruit grown in haste, untouched by wind and frost."</p><p>Qin Sang also ate one and agreed, "It's not as sweet as the ones at Sword Gate Pass."</p><p>"There are even better ones you haven't tasted," Qingzhu said regretfully.</p><p>Despite his words, Qingzhu finished the entire peach.</p><p>"Go now."</p><p>Qingzhu said.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Qingzhu with a hint of concern before flying into the Nether Valley.</p><p>As Qin Sang disappeared into the Nether Qi, Qingzhu summoned his spirit sword and slashed out a world-shaking sword energy, clearing a path for Qin Sang.</p><p>He softly chanted.</p><p>"With my sword, I cleave the Nether, in the next life, no more toil over ancient texts!"</p><p>The sword energy carved a path, breaking through the ancient restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang descended to the bottom of the Nether Valley.</p><p>Just as Qingzhu had said, there lay a copy of the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture."</p><p>After obtaining the cultivation technique, Qin Sang flew out of the Nether Valley and landed on the soil platform, instinctively slowing his steps.</p><p>Qin Sang saw.</p><p>On the stone wall were a few lines of text, left by Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>――</p><p>A small courtyard, filled with peach blossoms</p><p>A clear pond, flawless as jade</p><p>An elder sister, just sixteen</p><p>A younger sister, still in her childhood</p><p>A lifetime spent seeking the Dao, yet never knowing where the desolate grave lies</p><p>Better to</p><p>Live by the mountains and waters, farming and boating</p><p>Capture a demon or ghost, cast a divination</p><p>――</p><p>The words were written with sword energy, each character imbued with the essence of the sword scripture.</p><p>A fragment of the spirit sword was embedded in the stone wall, accompanied by a message: "This sword is a gift for Fellow Daoist Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang saw.</p><p>Qingzhu, holding a wooden peach sword, leaned against the peach tree and fell into an eternal slumber.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew.</p><p>Petals fell like rain.</p><p></p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>1. Today, I stayed home and wrote four chapters in one go to finish this volume. I'm posting them all at once to make up for the two chapters I owed earlier. Consider this my New Year's greeting to all my readers.</p><p>Wishing everyone a happy New Year and all the best!</p><p>2. The second volume has been renamed "Peach Blossoms."</p><p>3. The third volume is tentatively titled "Ascension."</p><p>4. This volume has covered everything I wanted to write, so there's no need for additional explanations or summaries.</p><p>5. As many of you have noticed, the latter part of this volume was quite challenging to write, but I finally managed to complete it. It feels like a great accomplishment.</p><p>However, I feel completely drained now and just want to sleep for a long time. I'll take a break for two or three days during the New Year and at the end of this volume .</p>
