<h1>Chapter 2095: Massacre</h1><p>Min Zhuo sensed a fluctuation and looked towards the source.  He saw a blurry figure appear on a rocky outcrop. The figure bowed slightly, said nothing, and vanished into the clouds.</p><p>Min Zhuo felt a chill. He hadn't sensed the person's presence before their appearance.</p><p>Zai Zhen had casually dispatched a Level Two Void Realm expert. His helpers surely numbered more than one, proving the terrifying power of the person behind this!</p><p>He, a mere test stone, had no ability to resist.  He'd better obediently follow orders.</p><p>But this powerful force, acting so secretly, using Zai Zhen as a proxy… did it mean their opponent was also incredibly powerful, forcing them to resort to these underhanded tactics?</p><p>This deduction was logical. Min Zhuo felt caught between two behemoths, liable to be crushed at any moment, potentially endangering his entire clan.</p><p>He dared not defy the power behind him, but could he remain safe after making a mortal enemy of a powerful demon?  Probably not. The worst outcome was that he became the sole scapegoat!</p><p>Min Zhuo couldn't figure a way to survive, only taking things one step at a time.</p><p>His mind raced, but his expression remained unchanged. He bowed and said, "Thank you, Brother Zai, for your concern for our clan.  We are in your esteemed companion's care. When should we depart?"</p><p>"There's no time to waste. Brother Min, if you have no other business, let's go!"</p><p>Zai Zhen stepped out of the stone pavilion. "We'll follow behind you, Brother Min.  Just use the incantation, and we'll sense each other immediately."</p><p>With that, Zai Zhen vanished into the forest.</p><p>Moments later, Min Zhuo concentrated, sensing that even Zai Zhen's presence had disappeared.  He had no idea how many experts lurked in the dense woods.</p><p>He silently recited the incantation, vaguely sensing Zai Zhen to his northwest.</p><p>"Brother Min?" Zai Zhen's thought transmitted.</p><p>"All is well."</p><p>Min Zhuo ended the incantation. Zai Zhen's caution deepened his earlier judgment.</p><p>He returned to the Sacred Lake and summoned his third son, Min Shu, and the elders.</p><p>"I'm going out.  After I leave, immediately seal the Sacred Lake.  Remember the ancient pact. If anyone dares attack our Sacred Lake, seek aid from the Zhu Yan clan; they will surely not stand idly by. If anything happens to me, Min Shu will take over. I hope you elders will support him wholeheartedly!"</p><p>Min Shu and the elders were shocked. Their clan leader had just broken through to Level Two Void Realm, a time for great expansion, yet he was speaking as if delivering a last will and testament?</p><p>Min Shu, terrified, knelt down, urgently asking, "Father, where are you going? Why...?"</p><p>Min Zhuo cut him off, saying gravely, "I'm simply being prepared. Don't panic! Just guard the Sacred Lake!"</p><p>With that, he stepped onto a wisp of water vapor and soared eastward.</p><p>Min Zhuo traveled alone to the Canglang Sea, unburdened by his clan, his escape technique at full power, incredibly fast. He sped past the Sheng Mu Plains, into the sea, islands rapidly receding beneath him.</p><p>Breaking through to Level Two Void Realm had transformed his escape speed.</p><p>The sensation was exquisite. Min Zhuo was almost entranced. This was the realm he'd always dreamed of, finally achieved. What a waste if he were to die soon after!</p><p>The Canglang Sea was now engulfed in war.</p><p>The demon army had invaded, their morale high after previous victories.</p><p>On the other hand, the Chang You clan, suffering repeated defeats and territorial losses, was demoralized. Even encountering similarly or even weaker demon forces, their first thought was to flee, often routing after brief skirmishes.</p><p>Entering the Canglang Sea, the Jiao Long King saw the Chang You clan's continued retreat and ordered his army to split into three, to maximize the enemy's destruction.</p><p>As the three armies swept across the land, Min Zhuo finally arrived at the Canglang Sea, only to immediately encounter one of the demon armies.</p><p>It was ill fortune for the Golden Toad King, as it was his force that Min Zhuo encountered, currently attacking in the southern Canglang Sea.</p><p>Stars illuminated the earth, their light glittering on the sea, yet demon energy filled the sky.</p><p>A group of Chang You clan members were fleeing when a golden light shot from behind them.  Within the golden light, concentric ripples spread. Upon touching a Chang You member, the person instantly stiffened, their armor falling off, then skin and bone, peeling away layer by layer in a horrific death.</p><p>The victim was a Level Four Yuan Realm expert, equivalent to a human Yuan Ying stage cultivator, yet utterly helpless.</p><p>Witnessing this, Min Zhuo coldly snorted, his fingers twitching slightly.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A wall of water surged up from the ocean beneath the Chang You tribesmen, perfectly blocking the golden light.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The golden light shattered, the water wall remaining unmoved.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>The Golden Toad King, amidst his demonic army, was taken aback.  This divine power he wielded was difficult even for those of comparable strength to counter. Who was this newcomer?</p><p>Golden light shone in the Golden Toad King's eyes as he gazed, suddenly noticing a figure atop the water wall—he hadn't even seen how they appeared!</p><p>Recognizing the figure, the Golden Toad King was startled, blurting out, "Min Zhuo!"</p><p>They had calculated that if Min Zhuo was in the North Sea or Sheng Mu Plain, he wouldn't arrive so quickly.  That's why they dared to be so reckless.</p><p>Then, the Golden Toad King noticed something else unusual: Min Zhuo was right before him, yet his senses remained blurry.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>The Golden Toad King's eyes widened, a terrifying possibility dawning on him, his face filled with horror.</p><p>"Golden Toad King!"</p><p>Min Zhuo's voice was icy. They were old rivals, having clashed several times before.  Among his most feared opponents were several of the demon race's Saint Kings, second only to the Glass Fairy.  Especially the Jiao Dragon King and the Dragon Whale; he had tried to set traps to kill them, but the two were cunning and adept at self-preservation, repeatedly escaping his clutches.</p><p>The Golden Toad King and his demonic forces were surely confidantes of the powerful within the demon race.  Min Zhuo had originally planned to avoid them, saving his strength. But now that they’d met, he couldn’t ignore them—Zai Zhen was still watching from behind.</p><p>Min Zhuo extended his right hand, lifting it gently.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The world's energy surged, the sea violently shook. Before the horrified eyes of the demons, the water on both sides rose, forming two colossal mountains of seawater in an instant.</p><p>The mountains were impossibly high, trapping them in a deep valley between towering, smooth cliffs, creating an overwhelming sense of oppression and unease.</p><p>Before the demons could comprehend what happened, the Golden Toad King transformed into his demonic form, roaring.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>The demons unleashed their powers, fleeing backward, but the canyon seemed endless.</p><p>The Golden Toad King's true form was a massive golden toad, its body like solid gold. Its throat pulsed, emitting a resonant croak that echoed through the valley, momentarily drowning out the crashing waves.</p><p>Simultaneously, the demons stiffened, golden toad phantoms appearing behind their heads, golden light enveloping them, their auras drastically changing, as if becoming the Golden Toad King's extensions.</p><p>Gathering the power of all the demon cultivators around him, the Golden Toad King leaped, attempting to escape underwater.</p><p>The next moment, the Golden Toad King felt himself collide with an unyielding barrier, immense pressure crushing him from all sides.</p><p>Heavenly might!</p><p>No, it wasn't just heavenly might; it was vastly different from that of a late-stage Transcendence cultivator!</p><p>It felt like this world was completely under another's control, and he was just a trapped beast in their palm!</p><p>"Is this the power of a Void Refinement expert?"</p><p>This was probably the Golden Toad King's last thought.</p><p>Min Zhuo's lips curled into a cruel smile, his palm suddenly flipping.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The two towering seawater mountains collided, crushing the valley and the demons within.</p><p>The resulting spectacle was terrifying; the impact created waves upon waves at the center of the collision, each higher than the last, as if they would strike down the stars and merge with the Milky Way.  All that was visible was a churning expanse of white water.</p><p>The seawater engulfed everything, completely obscuring the demons. Only with enhanced vision could one glimpse the occasional burst of blood, instantly washed away by the waves.</p><p>Each bloom of blood signified a life extinguished.</p><p>When the waves finally subsided, not a single demon emerged. Only a water sphere appeared, containing the heavily wounded Golden Toad King.</p><p>The water sphere was like a prison, firmly restraining him.  Min Zhuo brought it before him.</p><p>All the other demons perished. Only the Golden Toad King survived, immobile, brought to Min Zhuo.</p><p>Had the demon army been with the Golden Toad King, they might have formed an array to resist. Unfortunately, to wipe out the Chang You tribe, he had only kept a select elite force. Encountering a being comparable to a Void Refinement expert unexpectedly, they were utterly powerless and easily captured.</p><p>The Golden Toad King's death was certain.  Min Zhuo didn't interrogate him; he pointed at the Golden Toad King's forehead, a wisp of ethereal shadow shooting from his fingertip.</p><p>This was a secret technique akin to soul-searching.  As the shadow entered, the Golden Toad King's body trembled like a sieve, his injuries rapidly worsening, until he finally lost all life.</p><p>At this point, the surviving Chang You tribesmen, recovering from their shock, prostrated themselves, their faces filled with excitement and fervor.</p><p>"Greetings, Chieftain!"</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression was gloomy, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.  He had just soul-searched the Golden Toad King, hoping to find information about the powerful demon, but the creature knew nothing.</p><p>Among the demons, only the Jiao Dragon King and the Dragon Whale Sage could surpass the Golden Toad King. In the Demon Sea, the Golden Toad King's status was second only to the Jiao Dragon King, yet he had never received an audience.</p><p>"Could only the Jiao Dragon King know?"</p><p>Min Zhuo discovered that the Jiao Dragon King had broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage, likely connected to the powerful demon.</p><p>If the powerful demon intended to remain behind the scenes, supporting a single cultivator or clan, it would explain things.</p><p>Min Zhuo decided to spare the Jiao Dragon King's life; perhaps a chance for negotiation remained. He wouldn't tell Zai Zhen about his discovery.</p><p>Soul-searching revealed the Jiao Dragon King's forces were divided into three groups, the Golden Toad King had scattered his troops, and there was also the Phoenix King's contingent.</p><p>Openly releasing the Jiao Dragon King was impossible, but he could buy time. Zai Zhen ordered a massacre, but didn't specify the complete annihilation of all powerful demons.</p><p>Min Zhuo flew towards another group of demon soldiers.</p><p>Where he passed, none could stand against him. The sea ran red with blood, countless corpses littered the ocean floor; the demons suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>…</p><p>On a spirit island in the Cang Lang Sea.</p><p>Two Demon Marquises and the Black Lion Sage were on the island, along with Si Lu.</p><p>They were selecting a location for the altar's construction. They found the most suitable place wasn't the Jiao Dragon clan's territory, nor Tian Xing City, but this nameless island.</p><p>This saved the trouble of infiltration. The three demons had begun preparations years ago. Si Lu emerged from seclusion and, at Qin Sang's request, came to assist in building the altar.</p><p>The three core sub-altars had reached their lower two levels, the third level nearing completion.  The demon rebellion was perfectly timed.  Once Qin Sang dealt with his internal enemies, construction of the remaining sub-altars could begin.</p><p>Ordinary sub-altars were much simpler and wouldn't require Si Lu's personal involvement. They would be assigned to various clans and sects, and altars would soon spread across the realms, forming a massive altar array.</p><p>Si Lu sat alone on the altar; the three demons couldn't help. The Black Lion Sage went out to patrol, and the two Demon Marquises stood guard by the altar.</p><p>They were also aware of the situation.</p><p>"The Jiao Dragon King was a formidable leader, but unfortunately, he met his match," Gui Hou commented.</p><p>Luo Hou nodded in agreement. The Jiao Dragon King's strategies were precise and ruthless, and his talent and temperament were top-notch.  If he had been born in a Great Thousand World, he might have become a powerful ruler.</p><p>"Some of those tribes from the Demon Sea seem to have unusual bloodlines."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's rapid breakthrough to the late Nascent Soul stage was due partly to the Azure Spirit Qi, and partly to his bloodline.</p><p>"Correct," Gui Hou nodded. "The power in their bloodlines is extremely diluted, but tracing it back, their origins are likely quite significant.  It's curious how so many tribes gathered in a Small Thousand World.  And that's not the only unusual thing about the Storm World…"</p><p>Gui Hou had traveled extensively in the Central Plains, and much of what he'd seen indicated the Storm World was extraordinary.</p><p>Learning that the Storm World also once had a Zi Wei Palace shocked him.  He wondered why the Great Master had traveled millions of miles to return.</p><p>As they discussed this, Si Lu on the altar suddenly awoke, a surprised look flashing in his eyes.  He flickered into the air and looked west.</p><p>"Senior Si Lu, what is it?" The two Demon Marquises hurried to his side.</p><p>Si Lu gazed for a moment, exclaiming, "A Void Realm Double-Tier expert is attacking, seemingly using the Chang You clan's techniques…"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"A Void Realm Double-Tier expert? Did the Chang You clan's chieftain break through?"</p><p>The two Demon Marquises were startled and quickly thought of a possibility.</p><p>"Perhaps…"</p><p>Si Lu paused, producing a round mirror from his sleeve. The mirror's reflection enveloped them and the island, concealing their aura.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Si Lu said, "I'll use magic to contact Brother Qin. Don't go outside."</p><p>It must be a demon attack, enraging the Chang You clan's chieftain, who was now engaged in a massacre.</p><p>Although the victims were demons from the Demon Sea, Si Lu knew Qin Sang intended to eliminate the ringleaders, then demote the remaining cultivators to soldiers to protect his dao grounds.</p><p>The Chang You clan's chieftain was slaughtering Qin Sang's soldiers!</p><p>However, the Chang You chieftain's breakthrough at this time was a significant variable.</p><p>Si Lu's eyes flickered. He knew Qin Sang had been deliberately avoiding taking action.  Whether the Chang You clan's chieftain could be killed, and how, required caution.</p><p>Returning to the altar, Si Lu sat cross-legged and activated a spirit talisman. </p>
