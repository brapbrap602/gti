<h1>Chapter 1617: Mantis and Sparrow?</h1><p>Taiyue Sect.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon intensified.</p><p>A huge hole appeared in the sky, and the Immortal Mansion was seeping into reality.</p><p>The storm in the passage showed no signs of stopping, but the rate of outward expansion slowed.  According to Zhu Wu Dao, the passage was stabilizing.</p><p>However, the altar's tremors were far stronger than before, and the force grew increasingly intense. Outer cultivators were flung away, only a few like Mo Xing Dao and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master remained.</p><p>After some time, even Zhu Wu Dao and his four companions began to breathe heavily.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao gritted his teeth, his expression contorted as he stared fixedly at the passage above, saying nothing. Without his command, Su Zi Nan and the others dared not relax their grip, only persevering.</p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p>It felt agonizingly long.</p><p>Finally, the passage stopped expanding, hanging above Taiyue Sect. The turbulent sounds were still astonishing, but entry was now possible.</p><p>However, those entering still needed extreme caution; any misstep meant certain doom.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao gave the order.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The altar shook, carrying everyone skyward, plunging into the passage, instantly swallowed by the turbulent currents, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>The remaining disciples of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect split into two groups.</p><p>Some, confident in their strength, grouped together and followed Zhu Wu Dao into the passage.</p><p>Others, seeking safety, led their disciples away from Mount Taiyue.  They waited for the storm's intensity to wane and to avoid retaliation from Taiyue Sect—a decision they would soon be grateful for.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from afar, his sight enhanced to observe everything.</p><p>Su Zi Nan and the others entered the passage; the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect retreated.</p><p>For a moment, the passage entrance fell into a brief calm.</p><p>Judging by the intensity of the turbulent currents, it wouldn't be easy to enter, so there was no need to rush.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't move immediately, remaining where he stood, his gaze sweeping around, searching for the Eight Scenic Wonders cultivators. The hidden mansion had appeared; would the Purple Thunder Real Person still not show himself?</p><p>His eyes scanned the peaks, noticing escaping lights at the edge of the Taiyue mountain range. The celestial phenomenon had alarmed nearby cultivators who were rushing towards the area, but there was no sign of the Eight Scenic Wonders.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's gaze was drawn to Taiyue Sect's main peak.</p><p>When the celestial phenomenon erupted.</p><p>The Curtain of Heaven and Earth Formation and the Taiyue Sect's protective formation were both breached from within. However, the protective formation, rooted in the ground and the main peak, remained intact and could be repaired.</p><p>On the main peak.</p><p>The spiritual formation glowed, and several figures flew out. The leader was Hua Chenzi, the Taiyue Sect's Grand Elder.</p><p>The remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect hadn't gone far, but there was no time to settle scores now.</p><p>Hua Chenzi surveyed his surroundings and created talismans with his energy.</p><p>Dozens of Xuanhuang talismans floated before him. Then, Hua Chenzi tapped his fingers, sending streaks of light shooting out, and the talismans flew into Taiyue Sect's various peaks.</p><p>The earth rumbled.</p><p>The peaks shook.</p><p>The protective formation restarted!</p><p>No one hindered Hua Chenzi; this step was completed smoothly.</p><p>Then, an astonishing scene unfolded.</p><p>Dust billowed up from the ground, and under the influence of the formation, the main peak and other key peaks of Taiyue Sect sank into the earth. A thick layer of Xuanhuang light enveloped the surface, then slowly contracted to the size of a mirror before also sinking underground.</p><p>It was predictable that a fierce struggle would ensue, centered around the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Countless experts would be drawn here.</p><p>Unless someone relocated the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Taiyue Sect was nearby, its foundation here. If they didn't protect it, the sect might be destroyed if it was affected.</p><p>"Without the Sect Master's or my orders, no one is permitted to leave."</p><p>Hua Chenzi's voice echoed into the earth.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Outside Taiyue Sect, in a valley, brilliant light radiated.</p><p>Qin Sang, in the distance, moved slightly, muttering that the main person had finally appeared!</p><p>The light, like shimmering moonlight, arced through the void and landed before Hua Chenzi.</p><p>Both were familiar with each other, so there was no formality.  They nodded to each other, looking at the empty passage with varying expressions.</p><p>The Purple Thunder Real Person radiated moonlight, each person having a moon hanging behind their head, their energies connected. They, too, were preparing a formation.</p><p>Looking at the passage, the Purple Thunder Real Person pondered.</p><p>Yue Ling Tian said gravely, "The Wuxiang Immortal Sect's formation is more powerful than expected. The Five Phase Orders and the altar are the keys to opening the hidden mansion and should provide protection and guidance within the turbulent currents. The remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect are numerous. If they get there first, Daoist Hegao alone may not be able to stop them."</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>The Purple Thunder Real Person remained calm. "Fortunately, we are also prepared, and their Five Phase Orders are incomplete; the altar shouldn't last long."</p><p>With that, the Purple Thunder Real Person shattered a talisman.</p><p>The moonlight behind them brightened, encompassing Hua Chenzi and the others.</p><p>The figures blurred, and using their formation, they entered the passage.</p><p>Both sides are prepared, with numerous experts. I can only accompany them with my clone, but it feels rather thin... ”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly in her heart.  After the cultivators from the Eight Scenic View and Mount Tai Sect disappeared, she finally made her move.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as Qin Sang and her clone were about to depart, they suddenly stopped.</p><p>A black mist suddenly rose from the site of the old Mount Tai Sect, circled the entrance to the passage twice, seemingly observing, before disappearing into the passage.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, a little surprised. Although she hadn't gotten close, her spiritual sense detected a hint of threat from the black mist.</p><p>“Could it be another grand cultivator? Was it brought here by one side, or is it a coincidence? How many mysterious experts are still hidden in the Central Plains?”</p><p>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</p><p>Just how many mantises, how many orioles?</p><p>The waters of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect are possibly even muddier than imagined!</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated no longer, and flew with her clone to the passage below.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>Getting closer, the might of the turbulent currents became even more palpable.</p><p>The passage was murky and filled with visible chaotic energy. However, it wasn't entirely without pattern; there were clear fluctuations of layers of restrictions and spirit formations.</p><p>But this wasn't good news; it might require simultaneously resisting the impact and breaking the formations, making it even more difficult!</p><p>The power and chaos here were comparable to the Wuwang Hall. However, the interior of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was intact, so a gray tide shouldn’t occur.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Golden Sinking Sword, using its light to cut a path.</p><p>Her clone and her main body kept a distance, wielding the Stepping Snow Divine Blade, for vigilance.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly focused intently on the depths of the passage, pushing its Sky-Eye ability to the limit, piercing through the chaos to guide her.</p><p>Though Qin Sang had come alone, she was not lonely.</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang entered.</p><p>The first wave of cultivators, drawn by the celestial phenomenon, arrived—mostly Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Upon arriving, they saw a sight even more shocking than the celestial phenomenon itself.</p><p>“Where’s Mount Tai Sect?”</p><p>They stared at the empty ground, dumbfounded.</p><p>Most of these people came from forces on the outer edges of Mount Tai, including small sects and cultivating families, who had various connections to Mount Tai Sect; some had even visited just days before.</p><p>The less important outer peaks remained, but the main peak and core areas had completely vanished, leveled overnight, leaving them terrified!</p><p>“Was it caused by the celestial phenomenon?”</p><p>Someone gulped, their voice trembling.  “Who dares to go in?”</p><p>“Didn't we see someone go in just now? I wonder if it leads to a secret realm. The storm should weaken eventually; it can't stay this dangerous forever. There must be a way…”</p><p>A young man in a green robe looked at the passage with hopeful anticipation.  Before he finished speaking, a short, sharp scream was heard.</p><p>A cultivator, having gotten too close to the passage, had been affected by the escaping turbulent currents.  There was no time to escape before being pulled in, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>The others were terrified, scattering and circling the outer perimeter, afraid to approach.</p><p>At this moment, a streak of light shot from the horizon, stopping before the passage, revealing a lean, elderly cultivator—the first Yuan Ying cultivator drawn by the celestial phenomenon.</p><p>“It's the ancestor of Que Mountain!” someone whispered.</p><p>The Que Mountain ancestor stared at the passage for a moment, pondered slightly, raised his right hand, and a ring on his finger shone. A flock of spirit ravens flew out, letting out two cries before diving into the passage.</p><p>The Que Mountain elder stared at the ring, appearing lost in thought, actually sensing the spirit ravens.</p><p>After a while.</p><p>The Que Mountain elder's expression changed, his right hand trembled, and the ring on his finger suddenly dimmed.</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>A burst of laughter came from behind.</p><p>Space distorted, and a short, stout cultivator materialized beside the Que Mountain elder. “Seems like it's even more chaotic inside than out, old man. You got the short end of the stick!”</p><p>The Que Mountain elder’s face showed some embarrassment. He coldly snorted, “Old Ghost Qiu, you can try it yourself!”</p><p>“No need to try. Even if I forcefully enter, I'll be struggling. How about we wait for a few more friends and go together?” Old Ghost Qiu said, glancing sideways.</p><p>The Que Mountain ancestor didn't refuse, looking down at the ground. “Mount Tai Sect really has been razed?”</p><p>“Absolutely impossible!”</p><p>Old Ghost Qiu looked certain. “Yue Lingtian may seem rough and uncouth, but he’s actually very shrewd.  It’s not that easy to destroy his sect. Mount Tai Sect’s secret transmission, the ‘Thick Earth Record’, is unmatched in the world of earth-type cultivation. I bet he has a way to connect with the earth’s veins and hide his sect.  The celestial phenomenon was most likely created by Yue Lingtian!”</p><p>The Que Mountain elder nodded, gazing at the mirage deep within the passage.</p><p>Old Ghost Qiu asked, “Did you think of anything?”</p><p>“Didn’t you?”  the Que Mountain elder countered.</p><p>The two waited for a while, and a few more Yuan Ying cultivators were drawn.</p><p>Chou Laogui and his group attempted to force their way through once.  They found the passage too deep and, being disorganized and fighting individually, unsustainable.  They retreated and regrouped.</p><p>At that moment, two figures appeared.</p><p>"Friends, please wait..."</p><p>Chou Laogui instinctively invited them, but upon seeing their faces and cultivation, his expression froze. He instantly regretted his action, wishing he could slap himself.</p><p>Que Shan Laozhu and the others also changed countenance, bracing for a fight.</p><p>The newcomers were the Poison King and Master Huaiyin.</p><p>While Master Huaiyin wasn't widely known in Central State, the Poison King was infamous.</p><p>The Poison King, with an ambiguous smile, landed before the group.  He glanced at the passage, then at the ruins of the Taiyue Sect.  "Friends, might you inform this one what has befallen Taiyue Sect?"</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the passage.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and his companions, using the altar and the Five Phase Tokens, pressed forward. The five-colored light couldn't penetrate far into the turbulent currents, compressed into an oval-shaped protective aura that enveloped them.</p><p>The Five Phase Tokens, worthy treasures from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, proved their worth.</p><p>Protected by the aura, their pressure lessened. The passage's formations and restrictions dissipated silently upon contact with the aura, posing no obstacle. The turbulent currents generated by the formations were also weakened.</p><p>Unfortunately, this didn't last.</p><p>As time passed, the flaws in the counterfeit tokens manifested.  Zhu Wudao had previously used other methods to forcibly maintain the balance between the tokens, but he could no longer sustain it.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The altar violently shook, the Five Phase Tokens' light fluctuated wildly, their power unstable.</p><p>The two counterfeit tokens were the weakest points!</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Seeing the situation was untenable, Zhu Wudao warned, withdrawing his hands and retreating.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others reacted swiftly, instantly separating from the altar.</p><p>With a loud ‘boom,’ the altar exploded.</p><p>Shrapnel flew everywhere, instantly swallowed by the turbulent currents, reduced to dust.</p><p>The Five Phase Tokens were also blown away.</p><p>Five streams of light were extremely conspicuous in the turbulent currents.  They were about to be swept away.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's eyes shone with golden light, his gaze like a tangible force striking the Gold Phase Token. The Gold Phase Token instantly froze in place, encased in a small golden sphere. Drawn by the golden light, it was retrieved by Zhu Wudao.</p><p>The Faceless Man and the Swordsman did the same.</p><p>The Swordsman was even faster than Zhu Wudao, retreating while simultaneously slashing a blade of energy to disrupt the trajectory of the Earth Phase Token, easily recovering it.</p><p>The Faceless Man, transforming his arm into a wooden vine, wrapped around the Wood Phase Token and pulled it back.</p><p>However, the two counterfeit tokens weren't so lucky. Zhu Wudao's counterfeits, crafted as keys to open the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's legacy, were the best he could manage.</p><p>Su Zinan and the man in white, reaching for their tokens, watched as the counterfeits exploded before they could grab them—whether due to the altar's destruction, the exhaustion of their power, or a combination of both.</p><p>The man in white watched helplessly as the token fragments were carried away by the turbulent current.  A disgruntled hum came from beneath his mask.</p><p>Su Zinan salvaged some fragments—clearly impossible to restore.</p><p>His expression darkened slightly, then returned to normal. He subtly glanced at Zhu Wudao, the Faceless Man, and the Swordsman. Seeing that they had all retrieved their Five Phase Tokens, and it was impossible to use them independently to force the way through, he gave up.</p><p>Without the altar's protection, Zhu Wudao and his companions were still fine, but others found it more difficult.</p><p>The passage was open, the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's legacy lay ahead. Without external threats, the basis for cooperation was lost.  They inevitably developed individual agendas, making genuine teamwork difficult.</p><p>Although they didn't disperse, Su Zinan and the others maintained a tacit distance, each pursuing their own goals.  Those with weaker cultivation could only remain together, gradually falling behind.</p><p>A similar situation occurred behind them.</p><p>The Eight Scenery Sect and Taiyue Sect, combining forces and using a formation, initially advanced rapidly, but their speed gradually slowed.</p><p>While the formation ensured safety, it hampered Purple Thunder Realperson and Yue Lingtian's speed.</p><p>"Junior brothers, please assist this Daoist and Sect Master Yue for a while. You can follow later!"</p><p>Without seeing Zhu Wudao and his group, Purple Thunder Realperson could wait no longer.</p><p>Being fellow cultivators with shared destinies, the Yuan Ying cultivators had no objections. They immediately changed their formation, placing Purple Thunder Realperson and Yue Lingtian at the center, using combined power to cleave a path for them.</p><p>The two sped off, disappearing from sight.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>Tomorrow is New Year's Eve. Happy New Year everyone!</p><p>I wanted to add another chapter today, but I couldn't.  I couldn't focus.  I managed to finish this chapter only after repeatedly sitting down and standing up.  I apologize.</p><p>I will take a break for the holiday, resuming updates on the second day of the new year; that's three days of rest.</p><p>The story conveniently stops before entering the dungeon. This allows me to properly organize and strive to present the most exciting content to everyone after the new year.</p>
