<h1>Chapter 473: The Immortal Abode</h1><p>Chapter 473: The Immortal Abode</p><p>Immediately, all the runes swirled rapidly around the stone platform, finally forming a door.</p><p>A downward-opening door appeared on the stone platform.</p><p>All the runes shattered, spinning rapidly within the door.  The interior shimmered, the fragmented light leading to a chaotic void; nothing was visible, its destination unknown.</p><p>The moment the Star Master launched the beam of light, Yu Shan Ting suddenly activated a bronze bell, shoving aside Qingluan and, without looking back, leaped towards the door.</p><p>Qingluan had been preventing Yu Shan Ting from approaching Granny Jing.  Now,  Yu Shan Ting's sudden change of direction left Qingluan unable to stop him.</p><p>Around the Star Master...</p><p>The spatial fluctuations became increasingly intense and terrifying.  The Star Master seemed unable to withstand the pressure of the collapsing space; he was drenched in sweat, his body trembling violently.</p><p>The space around him grew increasingly unstable, an incredibly terrifying and violent power brewing.</p><p>"Fall!"</p><p>The Star Master roared, his voice strained and barely audible, raspy and almost unintelligible.</p><p>The stars shifted, the Milky Way and moon shattered, then fell back onto the Star Master.</p><p>All the stars merged into one, resembling the silver robe he’d worn earlier.</p><p>With his artifact returned, the Star Master's expression relaxed slightly. Ignoring Granny Jing, he mirrored Yu Shan Ting's action, striving with all his might towards the door.</p><p>Despite his surging cultivation, he wasn't much faster than Yu Shan Ting; the pressure from the spatial collapse was immense.</p><p>The silver robe, which had borne the brunt of the pressure, showed signs of fracturing; the outermost stars were extinguishing at an alarming rate.</p><p>Even if the Star Master escaped, the artifact would be severely damaged, requiring decades of nurturing to recover.</p><p>There wasn't even a moment to spare before the space consumed the robe, inevitably claiming the Star Master's life.  He dared not hesitate.</p><p>He had only one thought: escape!</p><p>…</p><p>The door was their entry point!</p><p>Qin Sang realized this. The door led back to where they had come from.</p><p>The Star Master had shattered his chains, unleashing his full cultivation, to break the entry's restriction.</p><p>They were trying to escape!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>Qin Sang had already retracted the ebony sword; the space around the Star Master was too dangerous; the sword would only be consumed if it entered.</p><p>He tried to change his target and pursue Yu Shan Ting, but it was too late. Their actions were clearly premeditated, perfectly timed.</p><p>Even more terrifying, the spatial collapse the Star Master had caused rapidly spread, darkness enveloping the void, concealing a monstrous beast that devoured everything.</p><p>The entire plaza was about to be engulfed.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt a sudden brightening. A beam of moonlight shifted slightly, enveloping him.</p><p>Granny Jing!</p><p>Qin Sang looked up sharply, seeing Granny Jing standing in mid-air, ethereal and transcendent, looking down at the Star Master.</p><p>The darkness encroached upon the space around her, threatening to consume her, yet her expression remained calm, her eyes unwavering.</p><p>"Seeking your own demise,"</p><p>Granny Jing said coldly.</p><p>Above her head, the River and Mountain Moon Chart was displayed; the moon had returned to the scroll.</p><p>The scroll unfurled, revealing what seemed to be a real world.</p><p>Mountains and rivers stretched endlessly.</p><p>Winds howled and clouds surged.</p><p>The moon rose from the clouds!</p><p>The moon absorbed the scroll's essence, eclipsing everything else within; then, an incredibly gentle yet incredibly swift beam of moonlight shot from the scroll.</p><p>This moonlight seemed to teleport, instantly striking the Star Master the moment it emerged from the scroll.</p><p>The door was within arm's reach, a single leap away.</p><p>Yet, that distance was like a chasm.</p><p>The moonlight froze the Star Master in place, immobilizing him.</p><p>The next moment, Qingluan, trailing azure light, flew gracefully towards them, ignoring the collapsing space around the Star Master, fearlessly charging in and embracing him.</p><p>Qingluan looked up at Granny Jing and let out a mournful cry, its eyes filled with boundless sorrow, a single tear seemingly falling.</p><p>It unleashed power far exceeding that of a typical Spirit Beast of its stage, knocking the Star Master away.</p><p>"No…"</p><p>The Star Master uttered his final cry, filled with utter despair.</p><p>As Qin Sang stared, transfixed by Qingluan, he suddenly felt himself tense as Granny Jing used the River and Mountain Moon Chart to gather him, carrying him into the door.</p><p>At the last moment, Qin Sang retrieved his twin flying swords, not forgetting to rescue the handsome young man abandoned by Zhangxing Laoren and Yu Shan Ting.</p><p>After their figures vanished, the entire plaza was swallowed by darkness.</p><p>A terrifying storm engulfed Qingluan and Zhangxing Laoren, growing ever more violent.</p><p>What lay beyond the door?</p><p>Could there be a Yuan Shen Men army, or even Leng Yuntian, waiting on the other side?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know, but he had no choice but to obey Jing Po Po's orders.  Zhangxing Laoren was undoubtedly consumed by the spatial storm, but Yu Shan Ting had escaped through the door, and he couldn't be allowed to return to Yuan Shen Men.</p><p>Qin Sang supported Jing Po Po in pursuing Yu Shan Ting to the death; the aftermath would have to be left to fate.</p><p>The power within the door was chaotic, making Qin Sang dizzy. Fortunately, the Jiangshan Yin Yue Tu remained wrapped around him, preventing separation from Jing Po Po.</p><p>"Suppress your cultivation to the Qi Condensation stage..."</p><p>Qin Sang heard Jing Po Po's voice. The order was strange, but without questioning, he obeyed immediately, activating the *Dun Ling Jue*.</p><p>As soon as he suppressed his cultivation, Qin Sang felt a chill on his chest. Jing Po Po had extended a finger and placed a restriction on him.</p><p>The restriction was simple, serving only to mask his cultivation fluctuations.</p><p>The chaos vanished instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang's feet landed on solid ground.  He opened his eyes to find themselves in a vast hall, roughly the size of the plaza.  Giant stone pillars surrounded them, but unlike the rough stones of the plaza, these were finely crafted.</p><p>A stone platform rose from the smooth floor, directly beneath them – similar to the one in the plaza.</p><p>The hall was empty. Qin Sang's gaze fell upon a figure fleeing towards the exit.</p><p>"Yu Shan Ting!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed softly.</p><p>The Jiangshan Yin Yue Tu shot out a beam of moonlight, striking Yu Shan Ting's back. A scream echoed as a bloody hole appeared, sending him sprawling. Yet, he quickly scrambled to his feet.</p><p>Seeing Yu Shan Ting about to escape, Qin Sang felt a surge of urgency.  "Senior, kill him quickly!"</p><p>He simultaneously prepared to summon the Wumu Sword, aiding Jing Po Po in the pursuit.</p><p>This seemed to be another secret realm, similar to Zhitian Peak—a place Zhangxing Laoren and the others called the Immortal Abode.</p><p>The absence of a Yuan Shen Men army was good news; Yu Shan Ting had to die.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jing Po Po didn't pursue Yu Shan Ting. Instead, she retracted the Jiangshan Yin Yue Tu and said to Qin Sang, "No hurry."</p>
