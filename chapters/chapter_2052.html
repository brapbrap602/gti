<h1>Chapter 2043: Outpost</h1><p>“Is this the territory of the Feykin?”</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards the Sea of Mist.</p><p>Judging by its position, it was located northeast of Kanzhou, right beside it.</p><p>Elder You looked over and hastily replied, “Indeed! The Feykin resemble humans in appearance, but they dwell within the Sea of Mist year-round, quite aloof, and are neither close to humans nor妖kind. I've never been to the Sea of Mist. The map only roughly marks its location and is not entirely reliable.”</p><p>Qin Sang said in realization, “The Feykin are so mysterious. Has Elder You never encountered them? I've heard rumors elsewhere that some believe the Feykin are actually a branch of half-妖that luckily rose to prominence.”</p><p>“Half-妖are half-妖, Feykin are Feykin. They are not to be confused. Both half-妖and Feykin exist in Kanzhou, and I've encountered both. Fellow Daoist, once you've seen them, you'll know that half-妖simply cannot be compared to Feykin.”</p><p>Elder You shook his head, displaying disdain for half-妖. “Half-妖are mongrels, a mixture of human and妖bloodlines. Indeed, there are some prodigies among them who inherit the strengths of both races, but the vast majority inherit the weaknesses of both. Not only are they hideous in appearance, but the conflict between their bloodlines is difficult to reconcile, often leading to various congenital deficiencies. The more chaotic their ancestral bloodlines, the worse they become. Feykin, however, are like us humans. They receive education from a young age, understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. They are not as savage as妖kind. Some of their customs are even more meticulous than ours. Even when captured and made servants, no one looks down on them.”</p><p>“Servants?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Elder You nodded, chuckling, “Just as some capture妖kind to sell as spirit beasts, there are also audacious individuals who capture Feykin as slaves. Feykin servants are highly sought after in Kanzhou. They are adept at guarding cave residences, managing mundane affairs, and they bring great face to their masters in front of guests. Certain Feykin are born with unique supernatural abilities, making them even more useful than spirit beasts after being subdued. The top-tier clans, especially the Winged-folk Royal Clan, who claim descent from celestial beings, are incredibly valuable, even spirit treasures are difficult to exchange for them.”</p><p>As expected, in such a borderland between different races, slave trade was inevitable.</p><p>Humans could capture妖kind and Feykin, and naturally, these races could also enslave humans, as in their eyes, human cultivators were equally full of treasures.</p><p>Back and forth, the grudges deepened.</p><p>Qin Sang initially thought that if the Sea of Mist were far from Kanzhou, and the Feykin and humans did not interfere with each other, without any animosity, resolving the Storm Realm issue would be much simpler. However, if there was deep-seated hatred between the two races, he feared he would be powerless even if he wished to help.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang silent, gazing towards the Sea of Mist, seemingly intrigued, Elder You misunderstood his intentions. “Among Kanzhou cultivators, only a very small number have Feykin followers, and at least for now, there are no public markets selling Feykin. In reality, even if cultivators capture powerful descendants of妖clans, they are mostly traded privately, not openly auctioned within the state. If Elder Qin wishes to purchase servants, there are more opportunities in Bluesand State.”</p><p>Bluesand State referred to the vast sea area east of Sleepless City, not one of the eight Celestial States, but it was named a 'state' in imitation of Kanzhou.</p><p>According to Elder You, Bluesand State was home to countless factions, a mixture of different races, powerful cultivators, and a complex and intricate situation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, realizing that this must be a rule set by the upper echelons of Kanzhou to avoid provoking the powerful妖clans and Feykin clans, maintaining superficial peace.</p><p>Bluesand State was a gray area tacitly approved by all races, serving as a buffer zone for conflicts.</p><p>This also showed that Elder You had indeed drawn the map haphazardly. Kanzhou and the Sea of Mist should be quite far apart. Otherwise, if they were too close, confined to a small area, competing for cultivation resources, a matter concerning their path of cultivation and prosperity, conflict and slaughter would be unavoidable. The slave trade would flourish accordingly, not something that could be easily restrained.</p><p>For this journey to the Sea of Mist, he needed to first understand the Feykin and find a safe route to the Sea of Mist.  All of this could be found in Bluesand State.</p><p>“The Sea of Mist is peculiar. It must produce unique treasures. Our human territories certainly have treasures that the Feykin desire. Does our Alliance have no dealings with the Feykin?”</p><p>If possible, Qin Sang preferred to work through the Five Elements Alliance, contacting Feykin who were on good terms with the Alliance.  With years of established foundation, it would be easier to interact with them and then use this connection to inquire about the internal affairs of the Feykin.</p><p>Elder You's tone was evasive. “It's rumored that Feykin caravans come every so often, but they only deal with factions they recognize. Our Alliance branches haven't expanded beyond Kanzhou yet, so we send people to Bluesand State to purchase these treasures. If Elder Qin has any needs, you can instruct the Alliance stewards to search for them.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, knowing that this kind of trade channel was one of the foundations of the Five Elements Alliance, and it might involve numerous secrets. He was only a guest elder of the Alliance; the Five Elements Alliance wouldn't disclose these matters to him unless he truly pledged his allegiance.</p><p>He wisely refrained from further questioning. “To be honest, Elder You, I am indeed searching for spirit materials to refine a certain treasure. I'm still lacking a few.”</p><p>Saying this, he unhesitatingly took out a jade slip and handed it to Elder You.</p><p>After receiving and reading it, Elder You raised an eyebrow.  “The treasure Elder Qin wishes to refine must be extraordinary!”</p><p>As an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, he was naturally proficient in refining techniques, and he could discern clues just from the list of materials.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of being seen through. The list on the jade slip was carefully selected; even a Grandmaster Refiner couldn't deduce the final product.</p><p>From the Azure Mark Essence of the Azure Sky Cave Heaven, to the transactions with the forces of琼Lake, and then seeking out the Five Elements Alliance in Lotus City before departing, Qin Sang had exhausted all means.  Years of accumulated wealth flowed away like water, which he didn't hesitate to spend, and he had already gathered most of the key spirit materials needed for the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Next, with the help of the Kanzhou Five Elements Alliance, and another trip to Bluesand State, it shouldn't be difficult to gather the rest.</p><p>The remaining materials were those needed in large quantities during the altar's construction, relatively common, and should not be difficult to acquire. To avoid attracting attention, Bluesand State was undoubtedly the best choice.</p><p>It seemed he needed to go to Bluesand State quickly, gather information while collecting all the Thunder Altar materials before he could proceed. Qin Sang flashed these thoughts and then said, “You flatter me, Elder You. Does the Alliance have these in its collection?”</p><p>Elder You stroked his chin, pondering. “Among these, the Ephemeral Wind and Golden-Veined Grass Seeds, the Alliance treasury seems to have some in store. As for the other items, I can only do my best to gather information for Elder Qin. However, these two items may have already been promised to someone. I cannot make the decision on my own and must report to the higher-ups.  Moreover, the value of these spirit materials…”</p><p>“I appreciate your effort, Elder You!”</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and bowed respectfully. “For all the materials, I will do my best to ensure a fair exchange. I consider myself to have some modest wealth. Even if I empty my savings, my meager skills should fetch some price.”</p><p>Elder You smiled.  “Elder Qin is too modest.  Refiner Grandmasters are respected everywhere. Many would beg Elder Qin to owe them a favor. Please wait a few days, Elder Qin. I will make the arrangements now.”</p><p>Saying this, Elder You was about to summon a servant girl to choose a cave residence for Qin Sang to rest in the Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang politely declined, left the Five Elements Alliance, visited a few other places to broaden his knowledge, and then returned to his cave residence.</p><p>Su Nu and Gu Ya had already returned from their shopping trip and were waiting for Qin Sang in the main hall, playing with the novelties they had purchased.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang return, Gu Ya quickly put down the spirit shell-carved artifact in her hand and rose to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to them talk about what they saw in the city and asked Gu Ya, “Did you see any Feykin?”</p><p>Gu Ya was taken aback and glanced at Su Nu. She knew the importance of the Storm Realm and had remained tight-lipped in front of Su Nu.</p><p>“No,” Gu Ya whispered. She didn't understand Qin Sang's intention and dared not say more.</p><p>“You may leave first. I have important matters to discuss with Fellow Daoist Su Nu,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Gu Ya responded with a “Yes” and bowed before retreating.</p><p>Su Nu had been watching with a smile.  After Gu Ya left, she teased, “I wonder what unspeakable secrets Brother Qin is prepared to reveal to me?”</p><p>“It truly is a great secret, a matter of utmost importance. Don't blame me for being meddlesome, but you must first swear an oath, to remain silent even before your master, before I can tell you.”</p><p>Qin Sang said seriously.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's serious expression, Su Nu put away her lighthearted demeanor and said gravely, “Does this concern Brother Qin's safety? If so, it's better for me not to know.”</p><p>“It does indeed relate to our safety, but it also concerns our next destination. Unless you remain in Kanzhou forever, you won't be able to avoid finding out once we arrive,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Hearing this, Su Nu couldn't help but become curious. She immediately swore a karmic oath, vowing absolute secrecy.</p><p>Watching Su Nu swear the oath, Qin Sang spoke softly, “This begins with your ascension through the realm passage with the Seven Kills Hall. Since then, the Storm Realm has become increasingly unusual…”</p><p>In the quiet hall, Qin Sang slowly recounted some of his experiences, combining them with the information obtained from Gu Ya, carefully selecting what he could reveal, and informing Su Nu.</p><p>Hearing this, Su Nu was greatly shocked, even though she had other karmic entanglements.</p><p>“The entire Storm Realm ascended to the Greater Thousand World!”</p><p>Su Nu's almond-shaped eyes widened. Even the Monarch and White God General didn't know about this.</p><p>With her intelligence, she had observed Gu Ya's words and actions, and combined with Qin Sang's cautiousness just now, she had vague suspicions.</p><p>But she only dared to suspect that Qin Sang had found the Storm Realm's Dao Marker Gate.  She never expected the entire Storm Realm to ascend!</p><p>“Could it be that a Lesser Thousand World can merge into a Greater Thousand World, causing the Greater Thousand to expand? Or is it that the Storm Realm was originally a part of the Greater Thousand World?”</p><p>Upon first hearing this, Su Nu's reaction was similar to Qin Sang's.</p><p>The reason for this association was that the Storm Realm was truly extraordinary, otherwise, how could it have been chosen by the Purple Star Palace?</p><p>Now she could understand why Qin Sang was so cautious. Once this news leaked out, who knew how many people would come searching for the lost treasures of the Purple Star Palace.</p><p>“I've also considered this possibility, but matters of realms are beyond our comprehension,” Qin Sang shook his head slightly. “Now, the Storm Realm's situation is unknown.  It has fallen into the Sea of Mist for hundreds of years, surrounded by foreign races. It's unclear whether it has survived.  It's pointless to overthink.”</p><p>Su Nu quickly calmed down. “Brother Qin is right. Before the Storm Realm ascended, late Nascent Soul was the peak of power.  How could they resist the powerful clans of the Greater Thousand World? We must first find them before we can discuss future matters. So, Brother Qin intends to establish a Daoist Lineage in the Storm Realm. Collecting these spiritual materials is to refine treasures to protect your Daoist Lineage?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Exactly. I will definitely go and see for myself. If you have no intention of returning, staying in Kanzhou can also provide me with assistance.”</p><p>Su Nu smiled charmingly. “Does Brother Qin think I am someone who fears hardship and danger? Oh…”</p><p>She suddenly realized, understanding Qin Sang’s intention.  “Thank you for your consideration, Brother Qin! The masterminds who controlled me back then all perished in the Seven Kills Hall. The three great merchant alliances were annihilated, and I have personally sought out the remaining enemies after my cultivation advanced. Brother Qin saved my life, and the Four Saints Palace treated me well. All these good memories are vivid in my mind. How could I still harbor resentment towards the Storm Realm? Since I am a cultivator of the Storm Realm, even if not for anything else, just for this karmic connection, I should make this trip.”</p><p>Hearing Su Nu’s words, Qin Sang was relieved. He nodded, “You are right. Even if the Storm Realm couldn't withstand the foreign races, as long as they weren't completely slaughtered, and a spark of their lineage remained, since we come from the same realm, we also have a responsibility to bring them out.”</p><p>Cultivators who could completely sever emotional ties were ultimately a minority. Even though Qin Sang had always been a hands-off leader, if the Green Ram Palace were in trouble, he couldn't stand idly by.</p><p>“Brother Qin’s Daoist Lineage, I must secure a place for myself no matter what!” Su Nu showed a playful smile, then pondered, “After confirming the location of the Storm Realm, there's another difficult matter. The Sea of Mist is occupied by the Feykin. If they don't allow us humans to enter, we'll have to find a way to disguise ourselves.”</p><p>“We can inquire about all of this in Bluesand State.”</p><p>Qin Sang already had a plan. Since Su Nu agreed to go, he revealed it.</p><p>“Unlike other Celestial States, Kanzhou’s border immortal cities also have Grand Teleportation Formations. Next, you will go to Sleepless City, which shouldn’t take long to reach.  First, establish a base in Sleepless City, which might be useful in the future.  At the same time, investigate the situation in Bluesand State and find a way to contact the powers there…”</p><p>Su Nu understood the implied meaning. “Brother Qin won’t be going with us?”</p><p>“I haven't gathered all the spirit materials yet and still need the Five Elements Alliance’s assistance.  However, those treasures are not so easy to obtain. I might be sent on errands for a while. It's not necessarily a bad thing. Kanzhou and Bluesand State must have intricate connections. With one of us inside and the other outside, I believe we will have some leads soon,” Qin Sang said confidently.</p><p>Su Nu was meticulous, and these matters could be entrusted to her. With her assistance, Qin Sang felt much more at ease.</p><p>The two discussed for a long time in the main hall. Qin Sang explained his plan, and Su Nu made some additions. Then, they each went about their tasks, hoping to prepare everything as quickly as possible.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the restriction again and summoned Gu Ya, informing her that Su Nu was also a senior who had ascended from the Storm Realm.</p><p>Gu Ya was both surprised and delighted. Previously, she had harbored a trace of wariness towards Su Nu. Now, knowing they came from the same lower realm, her wariness vanished, and she felt much closer to her.</p><p>Qin Sang originally wanted to awaken the Sword Slave as well, after all, the situation in Bluesand State was unclear, and the more helpers, the better.</p><p>Su Nu stopped him.  “Let him stay. Brother Qin is interacting with the Five Elements Alliance; you need someone dependable by your side. You can’t handle everything yourself, lest you lose face in front of your fellow Daoists.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and agreed.</p><p>There was no time to lose. Su Nu and Gu Ya stayed for three more days before departing.</p><p>After seeing the two women off, Qin Sang waited until the agreed time and once again visited the Five Elements Alliance to call on Elder You.</p>
