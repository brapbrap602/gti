<h1>Chapter 1338: A Warning and a Deal (Make-up Chapter)</h1><p>Chapter 1338: A Warning and a Deal (Make-up Chapter)</p><p>Su Nu?</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>He had rescued Su Nu once in the Xuanbing Plain and was familiar with her voice.</p><p>This earth spirit was actually a puppet controlled by Su Nu.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, not revealing his identity.</p><p>Other earth spirits fiercely attacked, Qin Sang swept his arm, his ebony sword splitting into several sword beams, battling the earth spirit army.</p><p>The earth spirit controlled by Su Nu also pretended to attack Qin Sang.</p><p>Ming Wei was beside Qin Sang.  Seeing the abnormality of this earth spirit, she was secretly surprised, glancing at the earth spirit, then at Qin Sang, wondering who he was communicating with.</p><p>“Friend, you saved my life not long ago, and you don't recognize me so soon?”</p><p>A pretty face flickered across the earth spirit's face, disappearing as quickly as it appeared – it was Su Nu.</p><p>“Friend, you must have the wrong person.”</p><p>Qin Sang denied it.</p><p>When he saved Su Nu, he was wearing a mask to disguise his identity, and he had activated the Tianyao Transformation, his appearance and aura were vastly different from now.</p><p>Su Nu had actually seen through his disguise!</p><p>This was unexpected for Qin Sang.</p><p>“Friend, there's no need to deny it. My cultivation technique is special, my perception is extremely sharp. Outside the Soul-Bewitching Cave, I sensed that your aura was identical to my savior's, the same person, I just didn't have a chance to contact you.”</p><p>Su Nu quickly explained the reason.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, thinking that the ancient demon's cultivation technique was indeed sinister.  Even with his disguise, he was still recognized.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Qin Sang stopped denying it, “Friend, you possessed an earth spirit to find me, what is it that you want?”</p><p>“The time I can maintain this divided soul is limited; let's be brief.”</p><p>Su Nu spoke rapidly, with a hint of urgency. “Friend, I'll never forget your life-saving grace. I want to warn you that great calamity will befall this place. Friend, please do not participate in the struggle for the Soul-Washing Liquid.  Take my advice and leave the cave quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and suspicious.</p><p>His actions were related to Bai's warning, not entirely for saving someone, he didn't expect Su Nu to repay his kindness.</p><p>“I don't know what great calamity you're talking about.  Based on your words alone, you want me to abandon this treasure before me, isn't that too frivolous? If your East Extreme Alliance wants to use this method to clear obstacles, you should go find Blood Bat and Daoist Xiao Yun. I am alone and weak; I pose no threat to you.”</p><p>Su Nu said anxiously, “I have seen it with my own eyes and know your strength. But this Soul-Washing Liquid is truly something you should not fight for! Have you noticed the masked man among us? Do you know his identity? He is Ye Zunzhe, a Yuan Ying Master from the East Extreme Alliance!”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>Su Nu's news was earth-shattering, Qin Sang's heart jumped, his whole body tensed.</p><p>He suddenly looked up towards the seal in the center of the cave.</p><p>Not only the cultivators near the light shield, but also those further away were attacking the seal with their treasures and spells, and the light shield was trembling slightly.</p><p>One of them was the masked man, the Ye Zunzhe Su Nu spoke of.</p><p>“This is a trial ground for Foundation Establishment cultivators.  How could a Yuan Ying Master appear here? There has never been such a precedent since ancient times, it’s ridiculous!”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, not believing Su Nu's nonsense.</p><p>“Before entering the Seven Kills Hall, did you see such a person next to me?”</p><p>Su Nu asked back, sighing, “If it were me, I would think you were talking nonsense. But this is what I saw with my own eyes. The celestial phenomenon in the trial ground a short while ago was caused by his illegal entry…”</p><p>Su Nu detailed the ins and outs.</p><p>The details were thorough and stood up to scrutiny.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled the scene in the square; there was indeed no such person beside Su Nu. Could that person really be Ye Zunzhe?</p><p>Coupled with the celestial phenomenon just now, Qin Sang was somewhat uncertain.</p><p>“Ye Zunzhe illegally entered here, just to fight for the Soul-Washing Liquid?”</p><p>Qin Sang still couldn't believe it.</p><p>Su Nu claimed that the price Ye Zunzhe paid for his illegal entry was enormous, and a few bottles of Soul-Washing Liquid were not worth such a great effort from the East Extreme Alliance.</p><p>“He has other motives; taking the Soul-Washing Liquid was just incidental.”</p><p>Su Nu sighed softly, “Before Ye Zunzhe made his move, I couldn't prove anything. Once the seal is broken, you will know whether I am trustworthy or not. I have said all this; whether you believe me or not, I can’t control it. I only hope you will not blame me in the end.”</p><p>Su Nu's words were sincere, making Qin Sang uncertain.</p><p>But just based on a few words, he was to give up the Soul-Washing Liquid, missing the chance to form a Nascent Soul?  How could he be willing?</p><p>Just as Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>Su Nu pondered, "If you don't want to give up the Soul-Washing Liquid, you don't have to risk it.  Perhaps I can make a deal with you.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, “I'd like to hear more.”</p><p>Venerable Ye has promised me a vial of Soul-Washing Liquid, and I'm willing to give it to you," Su Nu declared, seemingly unconcerned about the liquid's value.</p><p>Qin Sang was intrigued but only half-believed her.  "Don't you understand the value of Soul-Washing Liquid? I doubt I possess anything comparable."</p><p>"Of course I do. It helps with Nascent Soul cultivation! But if I'm dead, what use is a Nascent Soul? It's just a moon in a well," Su Nu said sadly.</p><p>This piqued Qin Sang's curiosity.  Her tone didn't sound feigned.</p><p>"I don't understand, with your position in the East Pole Alliance, who could possibly take your life?"</p><p>"What if I told you it's the East Pole Alliance itself?"  A strange light flickered in Tu Ling's empty eye sockets.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  He knew better than most.  Elder Yue had once spent a large fortune rescuing Su Nu from Demon Island.  Su Nu had then risen from Foundation Establishment to late-stage Golden Core in mere decades, indicating the Alliance had invested heavily in her.</p><p>Cultivate and then kill?  Such a waste of a talented disciple.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's expression, Su Nu continued, "Outsiders wouldn't believe what I've been through.  As a young girl, I was fortunate enough to encounter the path of cultivation and was taken in by a senior cultivator as a disciple. I made many fellow disciples and thought I would achieve great things.  But that person was a viper, using my fellow sisters as sacrifices in a demonic array fueled by True Demon Qi. She aimed to forge a Five Yin Miraculous Body, and only I survived! She thought I’d be amnesiac because of the array and continued to feign concern before offering me to the East Pole Alliance Master…"</p><p>Su Nu's story was shocking.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. The senior cultivator she spoke of was Elder Yue.  He never imagined that such a seemingly virtuous person harbored such terrible secrets.</p><p>He finally understood. Su Nu's strange behavior was an attempt to escape Elder Yue's clutches.</p>
