Chapter 386: Thirteen Breaths

Silence.

A bluish-black ghost claw tore through the void, a sharp pain piercing Qin Sang's brow.

Less than three inches away!

Qin Sang's eyes widened, fixated on the claw, a hair's breadth from his face.  He could even clearly see the corpse poison flowing across the claw's inky black nails.

He flung his hand out!

‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’

The Ten Directions Yama Banners left his grasp, flying in all directions.  Catching the wind, they grew to the height of a man, towering within the ice palace.

A gale of icy wind howled.

The chilling air, even darker than before, threatened to extinguish the dim light within the ice palace.  Combined with the overwhelming corpse stench emanating from the flying night rakshasa, the ice palace resembled the eighteen levels of hell.

But.

Qin Sang didn't immediately control the Ten Directions Yama Banners to activate the array, nor did he choose to activate the Corpse Talisman.

His mind delved into his dantian.

A jade-like amulet emerged from his dantian.

The Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman!

A dragon's roar shook the heavens.

The talisman shattered, releasing a furious dragon spirit.

A dragon coiled around his body!

The ghost claw was now less than an inch from his forehead.  Qin Sang, who moments ago seemed sluggish against the flying night rakshasa, now moved with surprising agility.  At the very last second, he shifted sideways.

‘Swish!’

The stench of corpses filled his nostrils.

He narrowly avoided death, the claw grazing his ear.

One breath!

Catching a glimpse of the flying night rakshasa as it passed, Qin Sang instantly twisted, contorting his body into an unnatural angle.  The next moment, another claw grazed his chest, tearing his robes to shreds.

Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat, continuing his evasive maneuvers.

The two figures clashed repeatedly in the air, Qin Sang desperately dodging.

Suddenly, the ice palace trembled slightly.

The flying night rakshasa paused, turning its head towards the side hall where Yun Youzi was.  Understanding that Yun Youzi had begun his actions, Qin Sang knew he couldn't let the rakshasa be distracted.

Making a snap decision, he stopped dodging and attacked, conjuring a sword of spiritual energy.

Two breaths!

The flying night rakshasa was indeed enraged.

Three breaths!

Four breaths!

Thanks to the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, and several probing attacks that allowed him to understand the rakshasa's movement patterns, Qin Sang managed to predict its actions.  He exerted all his strength, but buying only two breaths' time was his limit.

He couldn't push it any further; otherwise, he would die!

Qin Sang sighed inwardly.

From his spiritual space, his consciousness surged forth, relentlessly locking onto the corpse talisman within the flying night rakshasa's skull.

Darkness enveloped Qin Sang; the rakshasa's grotesque face appeared before him, frozen in time.

A wave of icy chill swept across his throat.

The claw's nails were about to pierce his skin, and along with the flying night rakshasa, it slowed for a moment.

Qin Sang retreated explosively!

Five breaths!

The dragon spirit whimpered, withdrawing back into his dantian.

At the same time, a howling wind and raging ghostfire erupted, burning intensely.

Yet the ice palace grew even colder, bone-chilling!

The Ten Directions Yama Array.

Activated!

The corpse talisman's effect only lasted for an instant; the flying night rakshasa immediately awoke.

‘Whoosh!’

Countless strands of ghostly energy erupted, wildly attacking the flying night rakshasa.  These strands differed greatly from those formed by the Ten Directions Yama Banners; they were thicker, and the ghostfire clinging to them was deeper, almost black, like a substantial substance, coalescing into a sea of fire.

They resembled flames, yet were black, strangely ominous, like demonic fire from the depths of hell, chilling the heart.

Instantly, the overwhelming ghostly energy assaulted the flying night rakshasa.

A roar, not quite human.

The flying night rakshasa recoiled.

Six breaths!

‘Whoosh… whoosh…’

For the first time, Qin Sang clearly perceived intense emotions in the flying night rakshasa's pitch-black eyes: rage, killing intent, fury… and a hint of fear.

Worthy of its name as a living corpse, it hesitated, wary of the black fire and the countless strands wounding it.

Seven breaths!

Eight breaths!

The flying night rakshasa suddenly disappeared, only to be driven out again by the black fire.  Wounded by the ghostly energy, it roared in pain, but its advance was relentless; its eyes fixed on Qin Sang.  Suddenly, a black blade, formed from magical incantations, appeared before it.

The flying night rakshasa wielded the blade, tearing through the ghostly energy and black fire with devastating ease.


Nine breaths!

Simultaneously, two dark figures silently slipped into the Ice Palace entrance, one on each side.

This was the moment.

Qin Sang detached a strand of his spiritual sense, ordering two animated corpses to charge towards the side chamber.

"Transform into ghosts!"

Qin Sang's mind remained entirely focused on the Ten Directions Yama Formation. His hand seals changed rapidly. The Yin threads suddenly dissipated, the ghost banner's main soul roaring as it merged into a single ferocious ghost, blocking Qin Sang and fiercely confronting the charging Sky Night Rakshasa.

'Bang! Bang! Bang!'

Ten breaths!

Eleven breaths!

With a series of powerful punches, the ferocious ghost fought relentlessly, being smashed to pieces by the Sky Night Rakshasa. The Yama banner's main soul screamed, dissipating into black smoke, unable to reconstitute for a short period.

The Sky Night Rakshasa charged forward.

This brief exchange left Qin Sang severely depleted, his face pale.

However, he had bought himself enough time.

A satisfied smile appeared on his face. He swallowed several spirit pills he'd been keeping in his mouth, recovering some spiritual power.  He dismissed the Ten Directions Yama Formation, the dragon spirit essence reappearing. Then, he turned and fled.

'Whizz!'

The two figures crossed paths again.

Qin Sang used all his strength to evade the Sky Night Rakshasa's sneak attack. They brushed past each other, but unexpectedly, the living corpse had just infiltrated from the entrance and was struck by the Rakshasa.

The Sky Night Rakshasa's movements were unpredictable; it was simply the living corpse's bad luck.

However, only one of the living corpse or the fierce corpse needed to survive and enter the side chamber.

Qin Sang made an immediate decision, sacrificing the living corpse, ordering it to attack the Sky Night Rakshasa as a suicide attack.

'Pff!'

A fist shadow like lightning.

The living corpse seemed about to be annihilated by the Sky Night Rakshasa.

Then, something astonishing happened.

For some unknown reason, the Sky Night Rakshasa's fist froze before the living corpse, a human-like expression of struggle appearing on its face.

The punch hadn't landed!

Then, with a furious roar, the Sky Night Rakshasa abandoned the living corpse and appeared beside the fierce corpse.

'Boom!'

The fierce corpse's head exploded.

Twelve breaths!

What happened?

Why did the Sky Night Rakshasa not attack the living corpse, but mercilessly kill the fierce corpse?

Qin Sang was utterly astonished. The biggest difference between the fierce corpse and the living corpse was the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, but the Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual didn't mention anything similar.

Although it was a living corpse, its essence was no different from the fierce corpse; it was merely a tool of slaughter. It was impossible for a scene of 'living corpse meeting living corpse, shedding tears together' to occur.

Qin Sang couldn't understand, but the situation didn't allow him to ponder the reason for long.

The Sky Night Rakshasa, after killing the fierce corpse, vanished again.

Qin Sang immediately sensed something amiss behind him, a cold dread seizing him.

Sure enough, the Sky Night Rakshasa once again ignored the living corpse and attacked him. Without hesitation, Qin Sang ordered the living corpse to rush into the side chamber, while he retreated at full speed.

Only three breaths remained.

Not difficult.
