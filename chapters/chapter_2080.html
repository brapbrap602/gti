<h1>Chapter 2071: Individual Circumstances</h1><p>Li Yufu understood what Qin Sang truly wanted to ask. His expression suddenly grew heavier.</p><p>As he slowly recounted the events, Qin Sang, despite being mentally prepared, couldn't help but sigh.  The disciples and friends who had left the North Sea and journeyed to the Middle Continent, the former pillars of the Green Ram Immortal Sect, were almost all gone from this world.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu had given up the pursuit of the Dao early on, choosing to enjoy family life. As Qin Sang's disciple, she held a transcendent position within the Green Ram Immortal Sect. With the sect's growing prosperity, she had access to ample alchemical pills.  However, after barely breaking through to the Golden Core realm, her cultivation stagnated.  She eventually passed away of old age.</p><p>Perhaps because of this, she wasn't as stern as the other elders. The younger generation of the Green Ram Immortal Sect all enjoyed her company.  Knowing her own limitations on the path of the Dao, she dedicated her life to caring for the younger generation and tending to worldly affairs. Whenever a promising talent emerged within the Great Sui Dynasty, she would bring them back to the mountain.  Under her guidance, the Qin and Bai families intermarried for generations. Combined with other disciples from the Great Sui, they formed the Great Sui branch, now a flourishing lineage within the Green Ram Immortal Sect.</p><p>Mei Gu loved experiencing the diverse landscapes of the world. After Qin Sang's departure, she traveled extensively, fortunate enough to encounter several fortuitous opportunities that allowed her to barely step into the Nascent Soul realm.  However, Mei Gu believed that the entire North Sea's Four Regions might not produce a Deity Transformation cultivator in a thousand years, and she certainly didn't possess such luck. After forming her Nascent Soul, she became even more free-spirited, her footprints covering almost every corner of the North Sea's Four Regions, exploring places she hadn't dared venture to before.</p><p>When the Heavenly Transformation arrived and spiritual energy surged, her past indolence caught up with her.  It was too late to strive for greater heights, and she ultimately perished during a Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>After Mei Gu's death, the Demonic Flame Sect lineage failed to produce any talented successors. Without anyone to carry on the legacy, it gradually declined.</p><p>The Yuan Mirage Sect lineage faced a similar fate.</p><p>This lineage originated from the Yuan Mirage Sect, a legacy left behind by Zhao Ying, Qing Jun's disciple, after she joined the Green Ram Immortal Sect.</p><p>Zhao Ying passed away, and her descendants also lacked exceptional talent.</p><p>However, this lineage specialized in formations and restrictions, making them indispensable in wartime. Li Yufu highly valued this lineage and nurtured several outstanding disciples, but they unfortunately fell on the battlefield. All he could do was allocate as many sect resources as possible, hoping for the lineage's eventual revival.</p><p>Among the original lineages, the Sword Cultivator lineage flourished remarkably.</p><p>The first sect leader of this lineage was Shangguan Lifeng, who cultivated the "Green Bamboo Sword Canon" passed down by Qing Zhu, supplemented by Qin Sang's interpretations.  He himself stalled at the Golden Core realm and perished during a training expedition, but he had taken on an exceptional apprentice.</p><p>This disciple, whose Daoist title was Huan Hen, possessed extraordinary talent. After mastering the sword, he ventured out to avenge his master, single-handedly slaying his enemies and rising above his fellow disciples.  His cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds thereafter.</p><p>Huan Hen's talent, comprehension, and courage were all top-notch. He dared to fight on the battlefield, honing his sword against the Changyou Tribe. Combined with the sect's full support, he forcefully broke through the barriers and stepped into the Deity Transformation realm. He was the most outstanding member of the younger generation of the Green Ram Immortal Sect and currently commanded the front lines.</p><p>Tan Yi'en devoted his life to managing the sect's affairs. Because of him, Li Yufu and the others could focus on their cultivation. He organized the sect meticulously. Coupled with the solid foundation laid by Qin Sang, the Green Ram Immortal Sect thrived. Witnessing the sect's growing prosperity, Tan Yi'en passed away peacefully at the Golden Core realm.  Many of Tan family's descendants still served as stewards within the Green Ram Immortal Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the greatest regret for Tan Hao.</p><p>He was originally the most powerful cultivator in the Green Ram Immortal Sect. Under normal circumstances, with the aid of the Azure Spirit Energy, he would have been the most likely to break through to Deity Transformation. However, he failed to overcome this hurdle and died of old age.</p><p>Li Yufu's voice was filled with grief.  "Elder Tan had a chance to reach Deity Transformation, but for the sake of our cultivation, he took on the sect's external affairs.  Especially when the Heavenly Transformation arrived, he spared no effort to support our cultivation, handing over all the gathered spiritual materials and precious medicines for us to refine, leaving nothing for himself. He only wished for one or two of us to break through to Deity Transformation before the destruction, escape, and preserve the Green Ram Immortal Sect's lineage.  Elder Tan himself, however, neglected his own cultivation because of this..."</p><p>Tan Hao was now buried together with Shi Hong, with Tan Yi'en's tomb beside theirs, the family of three reunited in the afterlife.</p><p>Gazing at the clear blue sky, Qin Sang remained silent for a moment.  Yet another friend with whom he could sit and reminisce about the old days was gone.  Of the fellow disciples who joined the Kui Yin Sect together, only he remained.  Those experiences had become nothing but memories.</p><p>As old friends passed away, new faces emerged.</p><p>For example, the foremost figure of the younger generation, Huan Hen, who had already reached Deity Transformation, and Qin Nian Sui, the current leader of the Great Sui lineage.</p><p>Qin Sang still remembered this disciple. He was the first disciple of the Qin family to possess cultivation talent. Bai Hanqiu had once brought Qin Nian Sui to meet him. This young man was currently in the North Star Region, guarding the ancestral grounds of the Green Ram Immortal Sect. His temperament was good, and he might have the potential to break through to Deity Transformation in the future.</p><p>Among them, Li Yufu also mentioned an unexpected personâ€”Bai Ying'er.</p><p>"Bai Ying'er has repeatedly expressed to me that her greatest regret in life was not becoming your disciple.  Knowing of her connection with you, and seeing her excellent temperament and talent, along with her sincerity and lack of pretense, I requested Immortal Liuli's permission to allow her to pay respects before your sacred statue and become your disciple, joining the Green Ram Immortal Sect.  I acted without your permission, please punish me!"</p><p>Li Yufu knelt down and pleaded guilty.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered this woman. It was a karmic connection from the Canglang Sea. He had only briefly guided her back then, leaving her a cave dwelling. Unexpectedly, through a twist of fate, she had become his disciple.</p><p>He wouldn't blame Li Yufu for this.  "I offered her some guidance back then, which can be considered a form of mentorship. As long as she cultivates diligently and doesn't disgrace the Green Ram Immortal Sect, I acknowledge her as my disciple. You haven't erred in granting her this status."</p><p>Speaking of this, Qin Sang suddenly recalled that upon his return to the Canglang Sea, he had entrusted the Four Saints Palace to search for the Two-Headed Flood Dragon. He only received some rumors that someone had seen it with a young girl.</p><p>"Is there a Two-Headed Flood Dragon by Bai Ying'er's side...It might not have two heads anymore."</p><p>Li Yufu breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. "Disciple Ying'er is intelligent and cultivates diligently. She will never disgrace the sect! The one you mentioned must be the Flood Dragon. When I saw it, it already had three heads.  It was thanks to the Flood Dragon's protection that Disciple Ying'er overcame numerous dangers.  However..."</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that when the Two-Headed Flood Dragon was in its Form Transformation stage, it was about to grow a third head. It seemed it had successfully broken through. He also remembered the Two-Headed Flood Dragon's stubborn and gluttonous nature, and how it ultimately chose to lure away a powerful enemy for his sake. Learning of this outcome, he was quite happy for it.</p><p>Just then, Li Yufu's expression changed, revealing a look of unbearable pain. Qin Sang frowned slightly and asked gravely, "Did something happen to them?"</p><p>Li Yufu remained kneeling, his head bowed in grief. "This disciple is incompetent, failing to issue a timely warning, leading to Disciple Ying'er and the Flood Dragon, along with Senior Jing Yu, Chi Lei, Bai He, and other fellow Daoists from the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, being caught in a Mistfall and attacked by Mist Beasts.  They were unfortunately swept away by the Mistfall..."</p><p>With each name he uttered, Li Yufu's voice grew heavier, filled with immense sorrow.</p><p>The Storm Realm was composed of outsiders. Initially, they were unaware of the dangers hidden within the Mist Sea's changing weather patterns, resulting in the loss of many fellow Daoists.</p><p>Even though they later deduced some patterns, even the native Yi Ren Tribe couldn't guarantee complete accuracy in their predictions.  Therefore, every time the Mist Tide arrived, the Storm Realm still suffered casualties, and that particular incident was the most devastating.</p><p>Because of Qin Sang's relationship with Yun Youzi, the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea and the Green Ram Immortal Sect were inseparable, practically considered a branch of the Green Ram Immortal Sect.  The demon cultivators among them possessed numerous experts, and that Mistfall had swallowed nearly half of the Green Ram Immortal Sect's fighting force.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was heavy.</p><p>He had thought that with the "Heavenly Demon Body Refining Art" he had passed down, the Heavenly Dao's completion after entering the Great Thousand World, and the aid of the Azure Spirit Energy, the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea would have a chance to produce one or even several Deity Transformation experts.  He hadn't expected such tragic news.</p><p>No wonder he hadn't sensed any of their auras in Luye.</p><p>Gu Ya's experience proved that being swept away by a Mistfall didn't necessarily mean death, but it was highly likely to be thrown to the ends of the earth.  The Great Thousand World was vast and boundless, making future reunions unlikely.</p><p>Losing so many experts at once, the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea would likely struggle to recover.</p><p>"The Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea is currently supported by Senior Liu and Senior Yu Nu.  Because we still need to unite the North Sea demon tribes through the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, after suffering such heavy losses, Immortal Liuli and I fully supported Senior Yu Nu's cultivation.  Senior Yu Nu also encountered some fortuitous opportunities and finally reached the Deity Transformation realm."</p><p>Li Yufu's next words brought Qin Sang a sliver of comfort.</p><p>Yu Nu was the white cat who had sold him the cave dwelling back then.  Because she was personally enlightened by Yun Youzi and considered Qin Sang's peer, Li Yufu always addressed her as "Senior."</p><p>Her talent, recognized by Yun Youzi, was exceptional, and she had later switched to cultivating the "Heavenly Demon Body Refining Art."  Of course, her achievements were inseparable from her own efforts.</p><p>Finally, some good news. Qin Sang's gloomy mood eased slightly.</p><p>He knew that this was a matter of individual fate, the will of heaven, and he couldn't blame Li Yufu. He beckoned him to rise and inquired about the circumstances of a few others.</p><p>"Oh, that black lion is still alive?"</p><p>Li Yufu nodded. "This disciple realized that Fellow Daoist Black Lion didn't wish to be restrained, and he also wanted to unite the demon tribes against the external enemy.  So, I discussed with Junior Brother Shen and proactively released the restraints on Fellow Daoist Black Lion. Fellow Daoist Black Lion once said that you hadn't mistreated him and he didn't wish to be enemies with the Green Ram Immortal Sect, desiring lasting friendship.  He returned to the East Sea to gather his old followers and holds considerable influence among the demon tribes. He later contributed greatly to uniting the various factions."</p><p>Next, they discussed the sect's cultivation methods.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, many encountered difficulties after breaking through to Deity Transformation, facing the predicament of having no path to follow. Their cultivation stalled at early Deity Transformation, with only a very few reaching mid-Deity Transformation.</p><p>And even more of the sects' true inheritances weren't even complete up to the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Li Yufu said, "The crisis is imminent.  Facing external pressure, in order to quickly gain the strength to resist the Changyou Tribe, various factions have been forced to share some of their treasured cultivation methods for mutual study, but we've encountered many problems.</p><p>"Some cultivation methods are complete, allowing cultivation up to the Deity Transformation realm, but they contain various biases or flaws.  The obstacles are numerous and difficult to overcome, making it nearly impossible for ordinary people to reach the realms described in the methods.</p><p>"Some cultivation methods are incredibly profound, clearly superior techniques at first glance, but these methods are often incomplete.  Unless someone with exceptional talent can complete the method, they are even harder to cultivate...</p><p>"For various reasons, most people are unwilling to switch to the first type of cultivation method, instead choosing to study the second type, hoping to gain insights and perfect their own sect's true inheritance.</p><p>"This disciple has done just that, studying several incomplete cultivation methods and frequently seeking guidance from Immortal Liuli, leading to my current achievements."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.  The reality was as he expected.</p><p>Those incomplete cultivation methods were likely related to ancient secret realms like the Purple Star Palace.  Perhaps there were superior cultivation methods comparable to the "Purple Star Sword Canon" and the "Heavenly Demon Body Refining Art," but what had been discovered here were mostly fragments, which was truly frustrating.</p><p>If he hadn't encountered various fortuitous opportunities, he wouldn't have been able to gather the complete methods.</p><p>As for the second type, he had actually obtained a cultivation method called the "All Heavens Demonic Sound" long ago.  The Green Ram Immortal Sect had always had disciples cultivating it, but their progress had been mediocre.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Liuli had managed to break through to late Deity Transformation. Although she possessed exceptional talent, such an achievement was truly unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang had once entered the Xuan Tian Palace's treasury to examine cultivation methods. He remembered that the Xuan Tian Palace shouldn't have such a grand inheritance, and neither did the Listening Snow Pavilion.  The inheritances of the various sects in the Middle Continent and the Formless Immortal Sect were somewhat higher, but they shouldn't have true inheritances that directly led to the Void Refinement realm.</p><p>Perhaps Liuli had encountered other opportunities. After all, during the great upheaval, some unknown secret realms might have been revealed.  She had been the first to break through to Deity Transformation, allowing her to be the first to step inside and obtain the opportunities within.</p><p>For example, she was the one who discovered the Azure Spirit Energy.</p><p>At this point, Li Yufu thought of something and added, "The situations of the three races are different.  The demon race's situation is actually better than that of our human race and the witch race. Their cultivation methods are incomplete, but they can enhance themselves by continuously refining their bloodlines, albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>"Especially the various tribes from the Demon Sea, whose ancestral grounds still exist.  They seem to be able to gain benefits from their ancestral grounds.  Entering the Great Thousand World, rich with spiritual energy, makes breaking through realms easier.  Some powerful demon cultivators have long lifespans, but have been restricted by bottlenecks.  Their foundations are profound, and once they break through, they will accumulate and erupt, their cultivation advancing rapidly, with experts emerging one after another.</p><p>"If Immortal Liuli isn't counted, the demon race is already showing signs of surpassing us."</p><p>Qin Sang discerned the underlying meaning in Li Yufu's words and glanced at him, nodding noncommittally.</p><p>The various races and sects of the Storm Realm uniting to resist the external enemy didn't mean there were no internal conflicts. Everyone had selfish desires, especially different races. It was just that the enemy was too powerful, suppressing any outbreaks.</p><p>It was foreseeable that the day the external enemy was dealt with would be the beginning of internal division.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to establish his Daoist Sanctuary here and certainly didn't want his own sanctuary filled with such hidden dangers. Although he could suppress everyone with his strength, leaving them be was still a hidden threat.</p><p>He could tolerate others having different intentions, even his own disciples might not be entirely on his side, but those who harbored ulterior motives and were two-faced needed to be purged.</p><p>This was also the reason why he hadn't publicly revealed himself.</p><p>Next, the spearhead would be directed both externally and internally.  Therefore, he wouldn't take action to suppress the Changyou Tribe for the time being. Firstly, seeing their attack on the Storm Realm failing, they would inevitably seek external help in this time of crisis.  No matter how high his cultivation, he couldn't seal off an entire race. Secondly, this opponent was a perfect touchstone.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang said to Li Yufu, "Come, accompany me on a walk."</p>
