**Chapter 256 – Returning Sighting of Fire Birds**

Before they realized it, the cloud layer was right above them.

As they stepped onto the cloud layer, they realized that, contrary to their expectations, it was not shrouded in clouds. Their current location was only halfway up Tian Feng. Above them, the peak was unobstructed by the dense 禁制.

To their surprise, there was an endless amount of Fire Element energy spewing out from the crater on the peak of Tian Feng. As soon as they stepped onto the cloud layer, Qin Sang instantly felt the scalding air hit their faces, leaving them extremely hot.

This Tian Feng was actually a giant volcano, and it was still active!

If not for the cloud layer acting as a barrier, the entire Legacy space would have been engulfed by the fire element energy from the volcanic eruption. The surrounding vegetation that was barely clinging to life would have been reduced to ashes, leaving the land a barren wasteland.

At this moment, there were countless Fire Birds flying in and out of the volcano’s crater. They were so numerous that they formed a dense flock, causing the sky above the crater to appear as if it was covered in a layer of red clouds.

Just like the Flying Apes in the Earth Cavern, their bodies were also dark red. Their strength far surpassed their counterparts in the Trial, and they were also restricted by the invisible 禁制, unable to leave the volcano too far and could only circle above it.

It seemed that the interior of the volcano was the Fire Birds’ nest.

At the sight of the Fire Birds, Qin Sang’s heart suddenly skipped a beat. He clenched his palms together discreetly and moved his gaze around without being noticed. Finally, it landed on the edge of the crater, as if he was looking for something.

The mountain path led straight to the top of the mountain and extended into the crater.

Judging from the buildings on the mountain path, they did not seem to belong to the ancient cultivator’s Legacy. Xuan Yu Daoist was nowhere to be seen within their line of sight. Since the mountain path led directly into the crater, could the ancient cultivator’s cave be built inside the mountain?

One, two, three, four…

Qin Sang silently counted the layers of 禁制 on the mountain path. The last layer of 禁制, which was also the closest to the crater and the Fire Birds, was a stone hall.

The stone hall had been constantly bombarded by Fire Element energy over the years. Its surface had developed a layer of red glaze, making it look like a single entity, as if it had been cast from red jade.

If there were no accidents, it should be up to him to break through this stone hall.

Qin Sang lowered his head, his gaze downcast, unknown thoughts running through his mind.

Elder Earth Deficiency glanced up casually, but he did not see Xuan Yu Daoist. He frowned and said nothing as he looked at the flock of Fire Birds in the crater.

Just then, the ground suddenly began to shake violently.

The shaking came and went quickly.

Even Elder Earth Deficiency was momentarily stunned.

Ren Hong hesitated for a moment and said in a small voice, “The shaking doesn’t seem to be coming from beneath our feet…”

Qin Sang nodded in agreement, his gaze shifting to the sky on his left.

Although he could not see it with his naked eye, he could vaguely sense that the source of the shockwaves was there, on the peak that Si Kong Mu Yue had climbed and descended. There should be no one on it now. He did not know what had happened, or if Si Kong Mu Yue had done something.

They waited for a while, but there were no more aftershocks.

Elder Earth Deficiency retracted his gaze and said coldly, “Let’s continue.”

…

The stone hall was like a flawless porcelain item. The light reflected by its glazed surface was not just red, but had a neon-like halo around it, making it quite beautiful.

Qin Sang moved his left arm.

Earlier, when they passed through a 禁制, he was ambushed and his left arm was almost severed. Fortunately, Elder Earth Deficiency’s pill had a remarkable effect, and it was now fine.

Along the way, Qin Sang had broken through more than 20 禁制. The power of the 禁制 increased as they went deeper. After all, his cultivation level was limited, and there were many times when Qin Sang was at a loss. He had to rely on Elder Earth Deficiency’s guidance to pass through. He had almost died countless times, which allowed Qin Sang to truly experience the terror of Nascent Soul Stage cultivators.

If he had not been held back by Xuan Yu Daoist’s spirit talisman and hidden message, Elder Earth Deficiency definitely would not have had to go through so much trouble. The feeling he gave Qin Sang could only be described as unfathomable.

Qin Sang’s attainments in the way of 禁制 were also improving by leaps and bounds.

With the 刺耳 sound of grinding stones, Qin Sang pushed open the heavy stone door.

Shortly after Qin Sang entered the stone hall, Ren Hong, who had been pretending to be in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes. He looked at Elder Earth Deficiency’s back, then looked up at the flock of Fire Birds. His face displayed a mixture of hesitation and fear.

In the end, fear prevailed. Ren Hong gritted his teeth and knelt down. “Disciple greets Master. I beg Master not to let Disciple go and test those Fire Birds.”

Elder Earth Deficiency turned around and looked at Ren Hong, who was趴 on the ground, with a half-smile on his face. “Have you seen them before?”

Ren Hong nodded and said, “During the Trial, the second level was a flock of Fire Birds. Their cries could impact the Yuan Shen. At first, Disciple didn’t think much of it, but later, when I was surrounded by tens of thousands of Fire Birds, I realized how terrifying they were. Disciple almost died from the collapse of my Yuan Shen.

The Firebird here must be stronger than the ones in the trial space. I'm afraid that hundreds of them would be enough to kill disciples easily.

"Sonic shock impact of the soul?"

Elder Dique lifted his head, looking at the groups of firebirds thoughtfully, with nothing but joy in his eyes.

At this moment, Qin Sang finally rushed out of the stone temple, looking rather disheveled. He held his abdomen with his left hand tightly, with an extremely pale face and staggering steps.

There was a shocking claw mark on his stomach, almost splitting open his entire belly, exposing the jumping organs inside. Granulation tissues moved around the wound. Qin Sang had taken a pill early on, and the medicinal effect was currently recovering him.

The top of the stone temple was the edge of the crater. The entire view of the crater could almost be seen. The crater was bottomlessly deep. There were countless firebirds densely packed together, endless and innumerable.

Before Qin Sang could stand steadily, he suddenly heard Elder Dique's warning, "Don't move!"

Immediately afterward, the Sky Melody Conch in his hand flickered. An unprecedented mighty divine music power roared out, rushing behind him at lightning speed.

The crater was below. How could Elder Xuanyu possibly not have left a secret mark on the top of the mountain? Sure enough, everything turned out as he had expected.

Standing with his back against Elder Dique, a hint of excitement quietly flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.

Qin Sang turned around abruptly, only to see that there was already a visible distortion on the stone temple's wall. The wall was glowing with green lights. Upon closer inspection, there were eight different spirit symbols embedded in the wall, forming the Eight Trigrams Formation. It was incredibly hidden.

The placement of the spirit symbols here was extremely strange, catching the trespasser when they had just escaped a dangerous situation and their mind had relaxed for a moment.

But Qin Sang was not alone. Elder Dique had always been monitoring the space around them. The spirit symbol array was triggered by Qin Sang, and it was about to erupt, but Elder Dique took the lead.

The divine music power instantly split into eight strands, like eight ropes, which tightly bound the spirit symbols. Surprisingly, none of the symbols were triggered.

The green light just appeared before it was extinguished.

Unexpectedly, at this very moment, Qin Sang suddenly moved!

He exerted strength to throw the Sky Melody Conch in his hand. With a sudden step, he rode his sword towards the crater. At this instant, he exhausted all of his strength. His sword energy was as magnificent as a rainbow!

"Seeking your own death!"

Elder Dique's thunderous anger echoed in the soul space.

But Qin Sang turned a deaf ear to it.

Elder Dique sneered in extreme anger, looking disdainful.

As soon as the Sky Melody Conch left Qin Sang's palm, it disappeared on the spot. In the next moment, it emerged above Qin Sang's head, covering him!
