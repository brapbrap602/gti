<h1>Chapter 896: Martial Uncle</h1><p>After their figures disappeared, Zhao Songqiao's gaze darkened, a sneer playing on his lips. "Good riddance," he thought. "Saves me the trouble of silencing them."  His form flickered, weaving through the shadows as he circled towards the side of the low hill. The Skyeye Butterfly, with a slight tremor of its wings, effortlessly kept pace.</p><p>"Who's there!" The disguised cultivator and Fang Ting hadn't gone far when a sharp shout reached their ears. Looking up, they saw a streak of azure light descend from the summit, revealing a lean Taoist before them.</p><p>"Greetings, Martial Uncle! We are disciples acting on Martial Uncle Jin Yan's orders to gather Dark Thunder Wood and other spiritual materials." The disguised cultivator and Fang Ting hastily bowed, offering their explanation along with the token.</p><p>"This is indeed Senior Brother Jin Yan's token." The Taoist returned the token after examining it, then glanced at Fang Ting. "You came with Junior Brother Yang, but who is this woman? I seem to recall she's a disciple of the Misty Pavilion." He had seen Fang Ting upon entering Clarity Island.</p><p>"Discerning Martial Uncle, Fang Ting is indeed a disciple of Senior Chen from the Misty Pavilion. She's a friend of mine and, hearing I was gathering herbs, wanted to come and observe," the disguised cultivator repeated his earlier ruse.</p><p>"Senior Chen?" The Taoist's expression softened. "If she's Senior Chen's disciple, then it's fine. However, I have a few precious spiritual herbs growing on the mountain.  Don't wander around and damage the garden. Gather your materials and leave quickly."</p><p>As the Taoist turned to leave, the disguised cultivator quickly called out, "Martial Uncle, Senior Jin Yan instructed me to dig up six century-old Green Resentment Fruit roots. I'm inexperienced and fear I might damage the trees. Could you offer some guidance?" The Green Resentment Fruit tree bore spiritual fruit used to refine pills for restoring spiritual energy.  Century-old roots, rich in wood spirit energy, were excellent materials for refining tools.</p><p>"He took some just recently, and now he wants six more? Does Jin Yan think these trees are inexhaustible?" The Taoist grumbled, but readily agreed. "I'll take you.  The Green Resentment Fruit trees are delicate. Improperly harvesting the roots can damage them, weakening the potency of future fruits, or even killing the tree. I wouldn't trust you to do it yourself."</p><p>The disguised cultivator and Fang Ting followed the Taoist, arriving shortly at a herb garden.  Clearly recently tended, the spiritual trees within were vibrant, their leaves a jade-like green, their fruit recently harvested. The Taoist stopped before the largest trees, carefully examining them.  Finally, selecting one, he channeled his spiritual energy, employing some unknown technique, and lightly touched the tree. A green light enveloped it. The tree trembled slightly, radiating vitality.  The Taoist then formed a blade of light with his spiritual energy and meticulously severed a century-old root. He repeated the process, handing six roots to the disguised cultivator. "Remember, don't be reckless when harvesting such spiritual materials in the future."</p><p>"Yes, Martial Uncle!" The disguised cultivator bid farewell to the Taoist and flew with Fang Ting towards the back of the mountain.</p><p>Only when the Taoist was out of sight did Fang Ting dare to transmit her voice, "Senior Brother Zhang, Senior Brother Zhao should be in position by now, right?" She froze, seeing the grave expression on the disguised cultivator's face.</p><p>The disguised cultivator flew to higher ground, where he could see a large swathe of black shadow in the distance—the Dark Thunder Wood forest.  After a moment's thought, he led Fang Ting to a secluded spot near the exit. "Wait here," he said seriously. "Don't go anywhere. If anything happens, run."</p><p>"Senior Brother, what are you talking about? What could happen? Aren't you coming with me?" Fang Ting was frightened by his words.</p><p>"I can't explain, but something feels wrong about Senior Brother Zhao. Just in case. I have my own escape methods. I'll be fine. Be smart. You might need to create a diversion later…" The disguised cultivator gave Fang Ting a meaningful look and departed.</p><p>Panic seized Fang Ting.  As the disguised cultivator disappeared from view, a strange emptiness filled her chest.  One hand clutched her heart, the other reaching out involuntarily, grasping at nothing.</p><p>Concealing his presence, the disguised cultivator, guided by a faint connection to the Skyeye Butterfly, followed the trail straight towards the Dark Thunder Wood forest.  Soon, a dark forest, like a place of death, came into view. A faint, sinister thunder energy drifted between the Dark Thunder Wood trees.  Aside from a few special spiritual herbs, no ordinary plants could survive here.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao had infiltrated the depths of the black forest, oblivious to the Skyeye Butterfly tracking him.  Reaching the area where the sinister thunder energy was most concentrated, he stopped abruptly, scanning his surroundings. He then spat out a white pill, its surface seemingly coated in wax.</p><p>The moment the pill appeared, the drifting sinister thunder energy was drawn to it like a beast to prey, rapidly vanishing. Zhao Songqiao retreated, watching the scene unfold.  The nearest Dark Thunder Wood trees began to wither and die, turning the area into a true dead zone.  The sinister thunder energy from further afield was also drawn in, forming a cone-shaped vortex around the pill.  All of this occurred in silence.</p><p>After absorbing an unknown amount of sinister thunder energy, the pill cracked open with a 'snap,' releasing a dragonfly-like insect.</p><p>Hidden in the distance, the disguised cultivator, witnessing this through the Skyeye Butterfly, was stunned.  Witchcraft insect control was vastly different from human methods, and he was an expert in both.  "A Gu insect!"</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Clarity Island, three streaks of light sped across the sea, heading straight for the island's entrance.  The three cultivators made no attempt to conceal their powerful auras. Their light tore across the ocean surface, creating waves in their wake, an aggressive display more akin to a punitive expedition than attendance at a Dharma Assembly.</p><p>The Lantern Fighting Sect disciples guarding the entrance paled at the sight. "Three Foundation Establishment cultivators! Who are they?"  They exchanged uncertain glances, unable to recognize their origins.</p><p>"They seem hostile, beyond our ability to stop.  Quickly inform Head Disciple Lu!" An elder spoke, immediately sending a streak of light shooting towards Clarity Island.</p><p>Before the light even vanished into the mist, the three cultivators arrived before them, their speed undiminished.  The disciples stood their ground, bowing.  "We are disciples of the Lantern Fighting Sect, guarding Clarity Island under Head Disciple Lu's orders.  May we know from whence you hail and your purpose here, so we may inform him?"</p><p>"I'm your Martial Uncle! Are you blind, daring to stop me?!" The leading, burly man roared, tossing a dark iron token into the elder's arms and barging forward.</p>
