Chapter 403: Igniting the Demonic Fire


The Wuji Sect Master raised his sword, pointing it upwards.  The spiritual sword transformed into a streak of azure light, shooting skyward.  High in the air, it flashed, drawing in the surrounding gale, creating a vast void.


Immediately afterward, the spiritual sword vanished, leaving only a humming sound that echoed through the heavens, seemingly suppressing the Xuan Frost Gale.


Is this the most powerful technique of the *Shadowless Sword*?


Qin Sang tilted his head, his gaze shifting. He could only see emptiness in the void, unable to find the sword's true form, unsure where it had struck.


As the Wuji Sect Master made his move, another figure in a black robe also acted.


He formed a palm strike, condensing immense spiritual power, and slammed it towards the Xuan Turtle Shell.


The Xuan Turtle phantom trembled.  A thick, dark light surged from within the shell, instantly filling the entire phantom. At that moment, the Xuan Turtle seemed to come alive, like a real, ferocious beast.


A low roar, no less powerful than the sword's hum, echoed across the land as the Xuan Turtle raised its head.


Its giant eyes glowed crimson as it glared at the Thunder Hawk.  Its body was pitch-black, its shell like a piece of black iron.  Its massive body seemed heavy, yet it moved with surprising agility. In a flash, it crossed the void, appearing beside the Thunder Hawk, opening its bloody maw, its sharp fangs aiming for the Hawk's right wing.


‘Lì!’


The Thunder Hawk shrieked. The silver feathers on its long neck glittered, lightning coursing between them, finally converging towards its wings.


Its wings were dyed silver, transforming into a pair of enormous lightning wings.


Facing the Xuan Turtle's attack, the Thunder Hawk didn't flinch. Instead of dodging, it slammed its wings against the Turtle.


‘Pā!’


The giant wings struck, merging with the lightning storm, like two thunder whips, striking the Xuan Turtle squarely.


The Xuan Turtle howled, its movement halting as the lightning storm exploded within it.


The Thunder Hawk seized the opportunity, opening its beak and spewing a massive column of lightning.  The silver light on its body dimmed abruptly.


For some reason, the lightning column shot towards the empty space in front of it.


The humming sound stopped abruptly.  The lightning column transformed into a square lightning cage, trapping a spiritual sword within.


It was the Wuji Sect Master's sword!


The Wuji Sect Master, his sword move seen through, had to control his sword to break through the lightning cage.


The Thunder Hawk's ferocity soared; it was simultaneously blocking the attacks of two Yuan Ying cultivators.


At that moment, the Thunder Hawk, without pausing, its eyes flashing, suddenly fixed its gaze downward. Then, with a powerful beat of its wings, it transformed into a streak of lightning and fled.


‘Pēng!’


A figure, unseen until now, had been lurking there – the black-robed man.


He had stealthily approached, but the Thunder Hawk's lightning eyes had seen him, and the Hawk used its lightning escape to collide with him.


The black-robed man flew back, his form disheveled.  The Thunder Hawk relentlessly pursued, its lightning form bending to continue its chase.


The black-robed man, unprepared for the Hawk's ferocity, found himself in a perilous situation and retreated.


Seeing the danger, the Wuji Sect Master, ignoring his own sword, rushed to the black-robed man's aid.


Together, they barely managed to stop the Thunder Hawk, both being forced back.


The Thunder Hawk shrieked a warning at the two.


The black-robed man, nearly injured, was enraged. He said something to the Wuji Sect Master and abruptly sat cross-legged in the air.


The Xuan Turtle Shell hovered above, splitting in two, then four… as the black-robed man changed his hand seals.


Even Qin Sang could see that the black-robed man was preparing a powerful technique. The Thunder Hawk undoubtedly sensed the danger.


It immediately vibrated its wings, unleashing a furious lightning storm.


The Wuji Sect Master leaped in front of the black-robed man, retrieving his sword and stroking it, forming a sword array to block the lightning storm, while the black-robed man remained seated, focused on his task.


The roles reversed; the Wuji Sect Master, employing various techniques, firmly held off the Thunder Hawk.


The battle took place in the distant sky. The gale and snow obscured the view, and Qin Sang could only see a fraction of the fight.


The black-robed man captured Qin Sang's attention.  Seeing the frequent changes in the Xuan Turtle Shell before him, Qin Sang knew he was preparing a complex and powerful technique that would take time to complete.


They seemed unwilling to give up!


At this sight, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  The idea he had just dismissed rekindled.


Time was of the essence.  Seeing the opportunity arise, Qin Sang moved immediately.

He suppressed his aura with all his might, skirting the glacier downwards, carefully navigating the most turbulent areas of spiritual energy and sheltering behind a column of Xuan frost wind.

This would shield him from detection by the Nascent Soul cultivator.

The deep cave lay at the foot of the mountain.  The closer Qin Sang got, the stronger the Xuan frost wind became.

His spirit was protected by the jade Buddha and remained unharmed, but his physical body began to feel the cold, a biting chill that quickly enveloped him, threatening to freeze him solid.

He had only just reached the cave's edge.

The Xuan frost wind's power was terrifying. Without the jade Buddha, he wouldn't have made it this far; his spirit would have been frozen to death by its chilling aura.

Even though the most extreme cold was ineffective against him, the wind’s chill overwhelmed the protection offered by the Red Pill.

Standing at the cave's edge, Qin Sang felt his meridians freeze.  He narrowed his eyes, peering into the blinding white expanse within.

The Thunder Hawk's nest might be deeper, or perhaps nothing was down there; he might have been wrong.

Qin Sang gripped the Red Pill in his right palm, his hand numb with cold.

Without the Red Pill, he would have had to retreat.  Going down, even if undetected by the two cultivators and the demon, he would quickly freeze to death.

This pill offered a slim chance.

Qin Sang channeled a thread of spiritual energy into the Red Pill.  Igniting its demonic fire would offer temporary protection for his body until the flames died down.

However, due to the Red Pill's unique properties, once ignited, the demonic fire couldn't be stopped until it burned out, completely destroying the artifact.

Destroying such a precious item might yield nothing, a complete waste.

Time did not allow Qin Sang to deliberate.  The battle was ever-changing; he barely hesitated before deciding to activate the Red Pill's demonic fire.

The chaotic fire erupted, mirroring a scene he'd witnessed before. The Red Pill melted, its surface flowing with molten flames like a glaze.

Qin Sang tried his best to contain the fire’s aura, but the Xuan frost wind stood in the way, readily extinguishing any emanation.

With the Red Pill in hand, Qin Sang's hands were burning, but his body gradually warmed; the demonic fire was indeed working!

However, as the fire burned, the Red Pill melted away, shrinking steadily.

The Red Pill's effect was temporary.

Without delay, Qin Sang stepped into the cave, descending along the icy wall.

Simultaneously, he deployed the Ten Directions Yama Formation again, ghostly banners swirling around him. One hand held the Red Pill, the other his magic weapon.
