<h1>Chapter 1163: Cleansing the House</h1><p>*Creak!*</p><p>The hall doors slowly opened, and a figure emerged.</p><p>The person wore a mask, their aura hidden and difficult to discern.</p><p>For a month, Qin Sang had been circling near the Qingyang Demon Sect. As he expected, the Qingyang Demon Sect was closed, and he hadn't seen any core disciples, making it difficult to gather information.</p><p>Suddenly, a person emerged from the Sect Leader's hall, speaking boldly.</p><p>Both sides were stunned.</p><p>Upon seeing the newcomer, Mei Gu and Zhao Shanran's eyes widened, their gazes fixated on the iron ring on the person's finger, their faces filled with shock.</p><p>Lu Xing also saw the iron ring on Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>A look of suspicion crossed his face. He glanced at Mei Gu and Zhao Shanran, sneering, "The old geezer disappeared over a hundred years ago, his body turned to dust long ago. You dare to impersonate him, treating everyone in the Moyan Sect as fools?"</p><p>Mei Gu ignored Lu Xing, stepping forward quickly, still somewhat incredulous, her voice trembling, "You are... the Sect Leader?"</p><p>"Mei Gu, do you remember what I told you before I left?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled at Mei Gu, casually mentioning a few things.</p><p>"Disciple remembers it all, never forgetting a single word!"</p><p>Mei Gu wept with joy.</p><p>"The act is quite convincing…"</p><p>Lu Xing, uncertain, spoke sarcastically, but was restrained by Sect Master Dong, his expression instantly changing to one of alarm.</p><p>Sect Master Dong frowned at Qin Sang, a warning flaring in his heart.  He was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, yet he couldn't see through this person's background, but sensed a subtle threat emanating from him.</p><p>Suddenly, Sect Master Dong felt a gust of wind, then his vision blurred.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>Sect Master Dong shouted, "Be careful!"</p><p>His reaction was swift, just as he was about to summon his life-saving treasure, he found another figure suddenly appear beside him.  He cried out in alarm, retreating in terror.</p><p>Lu Xing was even more terrified. He had thought the other party was an imposter, but their movements were like a ghost, appearing before him in an instant.</p><p>"Such a traitor, what use is he?"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, striking down at Lu Xing's forehead with a palm strike!</p><p>The seemingly light palm felt to Lu Xing like thousands of palms, the surrounding space seemed sealed, leaving no escape. He found in horror that no matter how he dodged, he couldn't evade this blow.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Lu Xing let out a desperate roar, a red light erupting from his body. His life-saving treasure, the Seven Suns Ruler, flew out from within him, desperately countering the attack.</p><p>The Seven Suns Ruler's fiery power surged, forming waves of fire toward the palm, but Qin Sang didn't falter, his palm striking straight down.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p>The Seven Suns Ruler suffered first.</p><p>The treasure's luster dimmed, emitting a mournful cry, then the flames scattered, actually repelled by the palm strike!</p><p>The next moment, the palm, carrying the Seven Suns Ruler, struck Lu Xing's forehead.</p><p>Lu Xing's pupils dilated, he stood frozen.</p><p>Then, as if an invisible flame, it incinerated him, starting from his head, turning him to ash bit by bit, scattering in the wind.</p><p>In the end, the entire person disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Within the Moyan Sect, silence fell instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the Seven Suns Ruler to Zhao Shanran, unconcerned.</p><p>Then, smiling, he turned to Sect Master Yinquan, slightly bowing, "Friend Dong, I've established my sect here, yet haven't had the opportunity to pay you a visit, my apologies."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want the Qingyang Demon Sect to notice him, so the true energy he used was only equivalent to that of a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>But his physical body was too strong, even a bare hand strike couldn't be resisted by Lu Xing, so he presented this terrifying scene before everyone.</p><p>Sect Master Yinquan, snapping out of his stupor, shuddered, retreating dozens of meters along with Elder Wu, shocked by Qin Sang's display.</p><p>He thought that he could kill Lu Xing himself, but certainly not so easily. Even if this person was hiding in the Sect Leader's Hall, planning for a long time, taking the other party by surprise, this kind of strength was too terrifying.</p><p>Sect Master Yinquan steadied himself, secretly wary, confirming Qin Sang was only a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.  "Lu has been expelled from the Moyan Sect by Sect Leader Mei and agreed to be a guest elder of my Yinquan Sect.  It's not right for you to kill him before our eyes."</p><p>He initially suspected that this person might be an old Nascent Soul ghost, but quickly dismissed the idea.</p><p>If a Nascent Soul ancestor appeared, it wouldn't just be Lu Xing who died.</p><p>"Mei Gu is only acting Sect Leader; I haven't spoken yet, so Lu Xing is still a disciple of the Moyan Sect."</p><p>"This is an internal matter.  Are you interfering in the affairs of the Moyan Sect?" Qin Sang said meaningfully.</p><p>"Certainly not..."</p><p>The Yinquan Sect Master chuckled nervously.  "If that's the case, then Dong has misunderstood...May I ask your Dharma name?"</p><p>"My Dharma name is Qingfeng."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured towards the mountain below. "I have just returned from a long journey, and sect affairs are complex and inconvenient. I will invite you all to visit another day."</p><p>Mei Gu's eyes widened.</p><p>She remembered a disciple mentioning encountering an old friend with the Dharma name Qingfeng.</p><p>The Yinquan Sect Master, unfazed, nodded repeatedly. "Of course, of course. Dong will take his leave now and not disturb Daoist Qingfeng."</p><p>Turning away, his face instantly became as dark as the waters of a deep pool.</p><p>"Also, Mei Gu will lead half the disciples to rendezvous with you later," Qin Sang stated without room for argument.</p><p>The Yinquan Sect Master's expression froze. He nodded, turned, and hurried down the mountain, his back looking unusually distraught.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around to find the Moyan Sect disciples all staring at her, dumbfounded.</p><p>Even Mei Gu thought she was dreaming.  It was unbelievable. The Sect Master, missing for many years, had returned, possessing immense power, instantly eliminating Lu Xing, and driving away the Yinquan Sect Master.</p><p>"Greetings to the Sect Master!"</p><p>Mei Gu knelt down in worship.</p><p>"Greetings to the Sect Master!"</p><p>All the disciples shouted in unison, kneeling down en masse, their faces alight with joy and heartfelt admiration.</p><p>Zhao Shanran, gripping his Qiyang Ruler, trembled in his hands and voice.  </p><p>Hope was restored.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and walked towards the main hall, saying, "Rise. Sect rules remain unchanged. Mei Gu will continue as acting Sect Master. Mei Gu, come with me. Zhao Shanran and the Foundation Establishment disciples stay."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>...</p><p>After arranging for the others, Mei Gu, suppressing her excitement, entered the Sect Master's hall and froze again.</p><p>Inside the hall, Qin Sang stood with her hands behind her back, gazing at a portrait.</p><p>It was a similar back view.</p><p>The portrait was well-executed, but lacked the imposing presence of Qin Sang, appearing thin and pale in comparison.</p><p>"The Yuan Ying Patriarch…"</p><p>Mei Gu was completely bewildered.</p><p>She had been shocked repeatedly that day, thinking she had become numb. But at that moment, her mind went blank, utterly confused.</p><p>"You've done well these past years."</p><p>Qin Sang turned around, her face showing approval.</p><p>Mei Gu stared blankly at Qin Sang, then burst into tears. Years of hardship and repression finally found release; she finally had support, no longer needing to bear the burden alone.</p>
