<h1>Chapter 2049: Meritorious Deeds</h1><p>“I think there might be something hidden within that strand of Qi, something only it can see.”</p><p>Vermilion Bird raised a wing, pointing at the Qilin egg.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. What Vermilion Bird said was highly likely. Logically, with the world in constant flux, landscapes changing drastically over countless years, even if there was a special marker in that image, it would be nearly impossible to find after such a long time.</p><p>The Qilin wouldn't perform a useless task; there must be another reason.</p><p>Given the Qilin's divine abilities, he and Vermilion Bird currently had no power to see through whatever secret it was hiding.  Unlocking it might require a key, perhaps the Qilin's own bloodline, or perhaps a specific catalyst.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart stirred again.</p><p>The Qilin's Origin wouldn't be placed casually anywhere.  Such placement would expose it to all sorts of risks, such as being discovered by enemies, being seized by outsiders, or simply dissipating over time. To prevent these, it would certainly be sealed.</p><p>Qin Sang touched the strand of Qi again, seeing the same scene, unchanged.  But after watching it over and over, a hundred times at least, memorizing every detail, he finally made another discovery.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He noticed that the moment the meteor fell into the mountains and the flames exploded, within the inferno, a faint ripple appeared and vanished just as quickly.</p><p>Of course, this could be due to the passage of time causing changes in the strand of Qi itself, but it could also be a ripple emanating from the Qilin Origin's seal.</p><p>“How does the Qilin plan for its reborn self to receive its Origin? If its main body arrived, their auras would resonate, instantly merging into one. It would only need to leave a guiding mark within its True Spirit or this strand of Qi. Why specifically leave this image? Could the key to opening the seal be hidden within the image itself?”</p><p>Countless speculations flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but they could only be verified after the Qilin's birth.</p><p>There was another difficulty. If it was as he suspected, should he return this strand of Qi to the Qilin? And when?</p><p>If there were any hidden traps within the Qi, the centuries of planning he and Vermilion Bird had undertaken would be in vain.</p><p>“Why worry so much?  Let’s hatch it first! This Vermilion Bird doesn't believe it can defy the heavens.  Worst comes to worst, we’ll just kill it again!  What's so great about a Qilin?  This Vermilion Bird, in its prime, probably devoured several alive!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird’s face was fierce.  Whoever dared to obstruct their acquisition of the Qilin Origin would face its wrath!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a better solution for the moment, so he sealed the strand of Qi to prevent the Qilin's True Spirit from contacting it. He would wait for the Qilin to be born, observe its behavior, and then decide what to do.</p><p>Seizing the Qilin Origin was definitely not something to rush.</p><p>The next problem was how to hatch the Qilin as soon as possible. Qin Sang sensed the life force within the Qilin egg. Compared to the fetus of ordinary creatures, this life force was extremely vigorous. But according to Vermilion Bird, Qilins are born Divine Beasts, favored by heaven and earth. This indicated a deficiency in its innate constitution.</p><p>Forced incubation might lead to hidden dangers. Qin Sang didn't want a crippled Divine Beast mount.</p><p>The best way was to place it in a location rich in Heavenly and Earthly Qi, letting it absorb spiritual energy naturally and hatch on its own.  However, Qin Sang currently had no fixed abode and didn't dare let the Qilin egg stray too far from him.</p><p>“That means we need to go to the Storm Realm as soon as possible. Find a spirit vein, establish a cave dwelling, and nurture the Qilin egg there…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, silently urging the lotus platform. The flames within the cave dwelling subsided, the platform merging into his body. He then recalled Vermilion Bird and walked out.</p><p>“Greetings, Master!”</p><p>The two brothers, sensing the fluctuations in the restrictive formation, saluted respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his escaping light enveloping them as they transformed into a streak of rainbow light, soaring through the sky.</p><p>Returning along the same path, they arrived back at Xu Wei City.  Qin Sang sent the two brothers to their cave dwelling and inquired about what had happened with Sword Slave during this period before immediately setting off to visit Elder You at the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>Having been schemed against by Elder You once, Qin Sang showed no change in his expression upon seeing him again, smiling and cupping his hands in greeting.</p><p>“Was Elder Qin's journey smooth?” Elder You also appeared as usual, asking with a smile.</p><p>“Thanks to your blessings, I didn't encounter any danger. Unfortunately, the matter that Grandmaster Luo Hua sought was too difficult.  Although we did our best, we ultimately failed,” Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>“Oh?  Elder Qin was gone for so long and didn’t succeed.  That’s truly a pity!”</p><p>Elder You showed regret. “But rest assured, Elder Qin, we had an agreement. Regardless of success or failure, those two treasures belong to you.”</p><p>“Thank you, Elder You.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands again, getting straight to the point.  “I wonder if there’s any news of the other spiritual materials?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Elder You was clearly prepared, immediately taking out a jade slip. “After Elder Qin left, I wasn't idle. I tried my best to inquire about information for you, and fortunately, I found the whereabouts of three more treasures. As for other ordinary spiritual materials, the Alliance has also gathered most of them for Elder Qin, and they will be sent to Xu Wei City soon.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly used his divine sense to examine the jade slip. It was as Elder You had said. He was just about to speak when Elder You continued, “For those treasures that can be exchanged with other spiritual materials, the Alliance will handle the exchange and calculate a price. Elder Qin only needs to provide treasures of equivalent value to trade for them.  However, if the owners of the treasures have other requests, you’ll have to make a trip yourself.”</p><p>Things were going more smoothly than Qin Sang expected. Elder You had indeed put in effort. He didn’t know whether it was the Alliance trying to win him over, or Elder You trying to smooth things over between them.</p><p>It seemed that the Luo Hua Temple commission was an invisible test.  However, the Five Elements Alliance hadn’t expected Grandmaster Luo Hua’s own schemes, so the journey wasn't actually dangerous.</p><p>With benefits placed before him, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't dwell on the past, repeatedly expressing his gratitude.</p><p>“Thank you for your trouble, Elder You!  If the owners of the treasures have requests, I should personally visit them.  I wouldn’t dare trouble the Alliance further.”</p><p>Elder You responded with a single word, “Good. In that case, I'll have the Alliance contact those fellow Daoists. Elder Qin, just wait for good news!”</p><p>For the next three years, Qin Sang frequently traveled between his cave dwelling and the Five Elements Alliance, occasionally leaving Xu Wei City to cross vast oceans to acquire treasures.</p><p>The items Qin Sang needed were all exceptionally rare heavenly and earthly treasures. In order to gather them quickly, no matter what requests the owners made, he had to find a way to fulfill them.</p><p>With the resolve to endure humiliation, he became quite adept. He had helped others refine artifacts, assisted in exploring hidden realms, and even joined forces with others to deal with their enemies…</p><p>During this time, Su Nu and Gu Ya were constantly investigating and planning their trip to the Sea of Mist in Wu Mian City and Lan Sha Prefecture.</p><p>They occasionally exchanged letters, but out of caution, they didn’t mention any secrets in their correspondence, so Qin Sang didn’t know how much progress they had made.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang made a special trip to the Five Elements Alliance to bid farewell to Elder You. He then summoned Sword Slave, Qing Jia, and Qing Yi and embarked on a journey eastward.</p><p>After several transfers, he arrived at an Immortal City. However, Qin Sang didn’t continue east towards Wu Mian City. Instead, he left the city, soaring into the sky on a cloud, heading north.</p><p>As he flew, Qin Sang’s mind entered his Small Cave Heaven. Seeing the neatly arranged jade boxes, a satisfied smile appeared on his face, along with a deep sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Azure Mark Essence, Thousand Feather Spiritual Silk, Golden Peak Jade, Gold-Veined Grass Seed, Ethereal Wind, Dragon Gallstone Red Iron…</p><p>After five years in Kan Prefecture, combined with his previous acquisitions, he had finally gathered the most important spiritual materials!</p><p>Building a Thunder Altar was enough to bankrupt a sect; this was no exaggeration!</p><p>Qin Sang's accumulated wealth was already considerable, adding to what he had gained from the Soulfall Abyss, the Chen Clan's secret vault, the Azure Water Stronghold, and Cultivator Pei’s cave dwelling. While acquiring these treasures didn’t bankrupt him, it could be said that he had exhausted all means.</p><p>Fortunately, with the help of the Five Elements Alliance, he was able to gather them relatively easily. Otherwise, there would have been many more difficulties.</p><p>The purpose of this trip was to obtain a spiritual material called Nine-Layered Earth.  This material wasn’t as rare as Azure Mark Essence, but Qin Sang made a special trip mainly for the owner of the material.</p><p>This person was called Recluse Song Feng, a Void Refinement cultivator.  While this person might not be famous in Kan Prefecture, the sect behind him was extremely renowned: the Thousand Layers Divine Threshold!</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang had gained a general understanding of Kan Prefecture's customs and discovered how it differed from other Heavenly Prefectures.</p><p>In Kan Prefecture, apart from Xu Wei City, Immortal Cities were almost all built on islands with slightly less potent spiritual energy. The most fertile islands, overflowing with spiritual energy, were occupied by major Immortal Sects.</p><p>These sects were the true rulers of Kan Prefecture. Cultivators in Kan Prefecture might not acknowledge the Great Zhou Dynasty, but they held reverence for these sects and obeyed their decrees.</p><p>The influence of Immortal Cities was less prominent.  Those who remained in them were either rogue cultivators or small sects lacking the ability to protect themselves. Immortal Cities provided at least a safe haven.  No wonder Luo Hua Temple readily agreed to refine the jade ruler in Yan Ling City.</p><p>In Kan Prefecture, Immortal Cities functioned more like waystations attached to prestigious sects. Of course, what Qin Sang saw was only the surface; he hadn't yet come into contact with deeper aspects.</p><p>The Thousand Layers Divine Threshold that Qin Sang was going to was one of the dominant forces in all of Kan Prefecture. It was rumored that sects in the eastern part of Kan Prefecture had to heed the Thousand Layers Divine Threshold, and its influence even extended to Lan Sha Prefecture.</p><p>The Thousand Layers Divine Threshold undoubtedly had Body Integration cultivators, but how many, and whether they had any Great Ascension cultivators, was unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang had long noticed a particular issue. Not only in Kan Prefecture but also in the other Heavenly Prefectures he had visited, there were surprisingly few rumors about Great Ascension cultivators, even unsubstantiated ones.</p><p>It was the same with Nascent Soul cultivators in the central region of the Storm Realm, but at least their numbers, Dharma names, and sect affiliations were known.</p><p>Whether the number of Great Ascension cultivators among humanity was truly scarce or whether their divine abilities were so profound that they didn’t reveal themselves, perhaps even severing worldly karma, remained a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned towards the latter.</p><p>In fact, Void Refinement cultivators could achieve what ordinary people considered immortal feats, except for immortality.  It was hard to imagine the divine abilities of Great Ascension cultivators.</p><p>Having the opportunity to interact with the Thousand Layers Divine Threshold, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't miss it. If he could establish a positive relationship, it might benefit him in Lan Sha Prefecture.</p><p>It was said that the sect’s name, “Thousand Layers,” originated from the characteristics of its cultivation techniques and divine abilities, renowned for their cascading attack methods. When cultivators of the Thousand Layers Divine Threshold fought, their attacks were relentless, like tidal waves.  Initially, they might not seem threatening, but as their offensive momentum built wave upon wave, ultimately erupting simultaneously with overwhelming force, it was incredibly difficult to defend against, especially given the unpredictable timing and unified execution.  Opponents had to be constantly vigilant.</p><p>As he recalled the various rumors about the Thousand Layers Divine Threshold, Qin Sang suddenly felt a subtle fluctuation from his sleeve. With a flick, a jade pearl flew out.</p><p>This pearl was Recluse Song Feng's token.</p><p>Seeing the jade pearl’s light pulsating like breath, Qin Sang undid the seal. The pearl immediately transformed into a streak of light, flying through the air. He quickly followed.</p><p>Following the jade pearl, Qin Sang noticed the spiritual energy becoming increasingly dense, with Immortal Islands and cultivators appearing more frequently. Soon, a spiritual island appeared ahead.  Towering peaks covered in ancient pines stood on the island.  The jade pearl entered the pine forest and vanished.</p><p>"Recluse Song Feng's cave dwelling should be here."</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt somewhat disappointed. He had hoped to be invited into the Thousand Layers Divine Threshold to witness the grandeur of the Immortal Sect.</p><p>He gazed into the distance, seeing boundless clouds and continuous landmasses that almost turned a section of the sea into an inland lake. This must be where the Thousand Layers Divine Threshold's main gate was located.</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Hearty laughter echoed from the pine forest. “It must be Elder Qin!”</p><p>A figure emerged from beneath an ancient pine.  This person had an archaic face, a slender build, wore a Daoist robe, and possessed a carefree demeanor.</p><p>“Is this Recluse Song Feng? Qin greets you.” Qin Sang landed, cupping his hands slightly.</p><p>“Indeed. Elder Qin, please come in quickly!  Don't let the other sect members see us.”  Recluse Song Feng looked around nervously.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a light “Oh?” “What are you refining that you need to avoid your fellow sect members?”</p><p>“I intend to refine a spiritual formation. The formation is complete, lacking only a treasure to anchor it.  I can't refine it alone, so I had to seek outside help. But I've already boasted about it, and if my senior and junior brothers find out, they'll definitely come and mock me.  I must be cautious!  Elder Qin, you must keep this a secret for me!”</p><p>Recluse Song Feng's expression was serious as he led Qin Sang into the cave dwelling.  Once inside, his smile returned.  He called out, “Boy, bring the immortal tea!”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Recluse Song Feng slapped his forehead.  “Oh dear! I almost forgot, the boy went out to sea with the younger generation to hunt demons!  It’s a pity; brewing our sect's spiritual tea is quite complicated.  Otherwise, its flavor would be greatly diminished.  I'm too lazy to learn, so you’ll have to settle for plain water, Elder Qin.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, jade cups flew over, filling themselves with clear spring water.</p><p>“Oh?” Qin Sang took the jade cup.  “Does your sect also condone demon hunting?”</p><p>"They are not our kind, why not hunt them?"</p><p>Recluse Song Feng countered.  “Not only can we hunt them, but there are rewards for hunting a large number. But these words, once we leave this place, I won’t acknowledge.”</p><p>“Why is that?” Qin Sang was curious.</p><p>Recluse Song Feng chuckled. "The aquatic races of the Eastern Sea are relatively docile; we can’t openly advocate for their slaughter, can we?  If they were like the demonic creatures of Qian Prefecture, we wouldn’t have such reservations.”</p><p>“Qian Prefecture?” Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>In the Bagua (Eight Trigrams), Qian and Kun represent heaven and earth.  Qian and Kun Prefectures were located in the far north and far south of the Great Zhou Dynasty, respectively.  Therefore, Qian Prefecture was closest to the northern wilderness.</p><p>Recluse Song Feng was quite talkative. “Elder Qin hasn’t been to Qian Prefecture?  I haven’t either, but I’ve heard that demonic creatures run rampant there. Cultivators in Qian Prefecture can earn meritorious deeds by hunting them.  With enough meritorious deeds, they can set up an altar anywhere in Qian Prefecture as an offering and exchange it for desired treasures.  The treasures will then immediately appear on the altar.  Quite mystical…”</p><p>Thanks to the Operations Officer for their diligent work and double chapter recommendation.
