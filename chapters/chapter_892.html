<h1>Chapter 884: The Grey Rabbit</h1><p>Chapter 884: The Grey Rabbit</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>Elder Huayang’s expression shifted, and he looked at someone.</p><p>It was Zhao Songqiao, a man in his sixties.  Zhao Songqiao’s eyes were deeply lined, yet his face was resolute.  His eyes were closed, but his head kept turning, always facing a wisp of Yin and Yang energy swirling around him.</p><p>Seeing this, Elder Huayang quickly retrieved the jade slip containing the new disciples’ records, found the elder’s information, and sighed.</p><p>“Too old. He might have some hope cultivating other techniques, but if he tries to refine the Yin-Yang armor, building his foundation is hopeless…”</p><p>The elder slowly shook his head and turned his attention to the others.</p><p>At this time, the illusory body was flying through the illusion.</p><p>Here, time and space were illusory.  After flying an unknown distance, a grey light flashed in the midst of the white mist. The illusory body was about to pursue it, but stopped after seeing what it was.</p><p>It was a huge monstrous bird composed of grey energy, at least ten feet long.</p><p>The illusory body realized the bird was made of Yin and Yang energy.</p><p>At the same moment the illusory body discovered the bird, the bird seemed to sense it too. Without a sound, it suddenly flapped its wings, its speed soaring, disappearing into the white mist in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The bird was incredibly fast and possessed strange abilities. In the space shrouded in white mist, unless one was sensitive to Yin and Yang energy, even if they happened to spot the bird, they wouldn't be able to catch it.</p><p>The illusory body watched the bird fly away, chasing for a while before giving up.</p><p>It was certain that capturing the bird would pass the test and earn Elder Huayang’s favor.</p><p>But the bird was too large.  Catching that much Yin and Yang energy was only possible for someone with extremely acute sensitivity.</p><p>The illusory body lacked such talent, so it decided not to be too conspicuous.</p><p>Thinking this, the illusory body changed direction, continuing its search.  Finally, it saw a grey rabbit hopping in the void. Its expression brightened, and it immediately pursued it.</p><p>The rabbit's hind legs propelled it dozens of feet in a single leap.</p><p>However, these creatures of grey energy only excelled in speed. Under the illusory body’s persistent pursuit, it was finally caught, offering no resistance as it was seized by the scruff of its neck.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The instant the illusory body caught the rabbit, the white mist suddenly dissipated.</p><p>The illusory body's vision blurred, and then returned to normal.  Looking down, the grey rabbit had vanished, leaving only a thumb-thick wisp of grey energy struggling in its palm.</p><p>When it looked up, Elder Huayang was standing before it, and everyone in the hall was staring at it with complex expressions. The spirit array and the Yin-Yang disc had been removed without anyone noticing.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, I found a disciple with this talent today.  Being able to capture such a thin wisp of Yin and Yang energy is quite remarkable. Although his spiritual roots are somewhat lacking, breaking through to the ninth level of Qi Refining at such a young age shows the assessment of his mentality in the jade slip is accurate. With proper training, he can become a key member…”</p><p>Elder Huayang pondered.</p><p>In the past, such a four-spirit-root disciple would have required careful consideration, but now, they were short-handed, so he decided to accept him immediately. He looked at the illusory body with a pleasant expression. “Your name is Zhang Yue?”</p><p>“Disciple Zhang Yue, greets senior.”</p><p>The illusory body scrambled to its feet and respectfully bowed.</p><p>The elder nodded in satisfaction. “Are you willing to join my Lan Dou sect?”</p><p>The illusory body feigned confusion and glanced at the others.</p><p>The new disciples’ faces were full of envy. They had expected to see Zhang Yue's humiliation, but the situation had taken an unexpected turn.  The fact that he was accepted into the Lan Dou sect filled them with a mix of emotions.</p><p>The young man in green robes and the others also had complex expressions.</p><p>“What? You’re unwilling?”</p><p>Elder Huayang’s face darkened.</p><p>The illusory body shuddered and bowed. “Disciple is willing!”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao was also holding a wisp of grey energy, but seeing that Elder Huayang ignored him, he felt deeply disappointed.</p><p>An acolyte beckoned the illusory body to stand behind him.</p><p>Elder Huayang flicked his whisk, performed a courtesy.  “Daoist Qi, I apologize for the disturbance. I will be taking this disciple…”</p><p>“Please do.”</p><p>…</p><p>The illusory body and the acolyte stood together, following Elder Huayang as he flew out of the Yan Miao Pavilion, into the outer water mist illusion array, and quickly out of the array.</p><p>The遁光 suddenly brightened, shooting towards the Lan Dou sect.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang's true body, hidden outside the swamp, sensed the fluctuation and quickly came out, only to see the遁光 disappear into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with deep surprise.</p><p>Because he sensed that his illusory body was inside that遁光.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>Even Qin Sang, with his sharp mind, couldn't fathom the events unfolding in the Yanmiao Pavilion's ancestral hall. A series of mishaps led to his external avatar inadvertently becoming a disciple of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>A flash of a dragon's shadow enveloped him as he secretly followed.</p><p>Fortunately, his external avatar seemed fine, not showing any signs of restriction. It appeared to be a stroke of good luck.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang trailed far behind, watching the escaping light head straight towards the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>They traversed countless towering mountains and deep valleys.</p><p>Suddenly, Hua Yang Lao Dao stopped his flight, landing on a mountain peak. He instructed his attendant, "Take my token, bring Zhang Yue back to the sect, register him in the jade scroll, and then teach him the method of refining the Yin-Yang Armor and guide his cultivation. I'll visit a few other sects and pay my respects to some old friends..."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>The attendant received the token. Hua Yang Lao Dao nodded slightly and departed, propelled by the wind.</p><p>As soon as the escaping light was gone, Qin Sang's true body approached cautiously.  He was near the Lan Dou Sect's mountain gate, so he remained vigilant.  Finally sensing his avatar's thoughts, he learned the whole story, utterly surprised and feeling incredibly lucky.</p><p>He paused, then slowly retreated, watching them leave.</p><p>"Disciple Zhang Yue, may I ask your name, senior?"</p><p>After Hua Yang Lao Dao left, the avatar followed the attendant, striking up a conversation.</p><p>The attendant, despite his youth, already possessed the cultivation of a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator and was a direct disciple of Hua Yang Lao Dao.  He was clearly highly valued within the Yin-Yang lineage.</p><p>"I've only recently reached the Foundation Establishment stage and haven't received a Daoist name yet. You can call me Yang Uncle..."</p><p>The attendant's attitude towards the avatar was friendly. He sized him up and said, "Your talent is truly remarkable. When I underwent the Yin-Yang Disc trial, the Yin-Yang energy I captured was less than yours. Once you can cultivate the 'Yin-Yang Celestial Battle Secret Technique,' your progress might even surpass mine."</p><p>"I wouldn't dare compare myself to Uncle Master!"</p><p>The avatar chuckled wryly.  "I have four spiritual roots. To be accepted into the Lan Dou Sect is already beyond my wildest dreams. I only wish to cultivate diligently and not disappoint Master and Uncle Master. I don't dare to hope for anything more."</p><p>But inwardly he was musing,</p><p>True discipleship isn't that easy. This isn't Xiao Han Domain; it's not like Mount Shao Hua, where the cultivation techniques are readily available on Baota Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood that his unimpeded access to Mount Shao Hua was due to Dongyang Bo's 'consideration.'</p><p>He wondered about the connection between refining the Yin-Yang Armor and the 'Yin-Yang Celestial Battle Secret Technique.'</p><p>If he had the chance to study the Lan Dou Sect's true teachings, he wouldn't pass it up.</p>
