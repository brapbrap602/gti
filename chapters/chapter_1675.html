<h1>Chapter 1666: A Spark of Inspiration</h1><p>While moving, Qin Sang feigned a concentrated analysis of the protective spirit array, using the Fire Jade Centipede's connection to the Crimson Immortal Pendant to lock onto Kun Dao's location.</p><p>He gradually approached Kun Dao, arriving at the closest possible position. Unfortunately, he was ultimately blocked by the spirit array of the medicinal garden.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, passing by that location as usual, searching for weaknesses in the spirit array without alerting her.</p><p>The target was indeed inside the medicinal garden, stationary at a certain spot.</p><p>However…</p><p>According to the Fire Jade Centipede's senses, Kun Dao's position wasn't truly within the medicinal garden but above it, in… the sky!</p><p>Astonished, Qin Sang was filled with suspicion. He seemingly casually glanced upwards, but only saw surging wind煞, his vision obstructed by layers of array restrictions.</p><p>He recalled the feeling he had upon entering. It seemed there was a barrier at the summit of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  This barrier was connected to the Five Elements Divine Restriction, sealing this small piece of heaven and earth.</p><p>At the time, he hadn't bothered to verify it because even if he confirmed its existence, it wouldn't have been of much use.  He couldn't break the barrier alone, and a rash attempt might even result in backlash and unnecessary danger.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang seemed to grasp some key points.</p><p>Kun Dao's behavior within the mountain and within the Five Elements Divine Restriction differed drastically.  Inside the restriction, she moved unpredictably, as elusive as a ghost, instantly dispelling any thoughts Qin Sang had of pursuing her.</p><p>After entering the mountain, she acted completely differently.  Her movements were clearly tracked by the Fire Jade Centipede.  Unless she was disguising herself, she was being restricted.</p><p>But the Fire Jade Centipede had remained undetected.  She had no need to disguise herself.</p><p>He could boldly speculate that the barrier was infused with the power of the Five Elements Divine Restriction, or perhaps the restriction was the foundation of the barrier. However, the entire barrier wasn't solely composed of the Five Elements Divine Restriction, resulting in her only being able to utilize a portion of its power.</p><p>Hidden within the barrier, she could still conceal herself and stir up trouble from the shadows, but she was no longer as unconstrained as before.</p><p>New discoveries, along with the various details he had noticed previously, flowed through his mind. Coupled with Qin Sang's understanding of array formations, he arrived at what seemed to be the most reasonable conjecture.</p><p>If his guess was correct, this matter could be accomplished!</p><p>The key lay in how to strategize and trap Kun Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang considered his own abilities. His Daoist techniques and magical treasures were mostly straightforward. However, his Avatar's Glacial Soul Light and Profound Heaven Great Capture could be employed, followed by a sword array to finish her off.</p><p>What kind of spiritual herbs would the female cultivator use as bait, and who was her target?</p><p>While pondering, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly flashed, and he inwardly cursed.  Kun Dao moved like a startled hare, her speed exploding to the extreme as she dashed straight towards the entrance of the medicinal garden.</p><p>"She's made her move!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Kun Dao springing the trap so quickly was unexpected.  They hadn't even entered the medicinal garden yet, and the "fish" weren't all assembled!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sensed frequent tremors in the protective spirit array of the medicinal garden, causing the wind煞 to swirl wildly. It turned out that Mo Xing Dao and the others had begun breaking the array.</p><p>Simultaneously, the strange fragrance suddenly intensified.</p><p>With no time to think, Qin Sang hurriedly flew towards the entrance.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the changes at the entrance of the medicinal garden happened far quicker than anticipated.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao arrived, intimidated by the presence of the two True Monarchs. He stood at a distance, and seeing the two True Monarchs motionless, he wouldn't rashly approach, but neither did he intend to retreat.</p><p>From his position, he could see the purple light within Purple Thunder True Monarch's pupils. He also saw Purple Thunder True Monarch's nostrils twitch slightly, seemingly sensing the source of the strange fragrance.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao had tried, but the fragrance was faint and elusive, only discernible as originating from the medicinal garden.</p><p>He was curious about what methods Purple Thunder True Monarch would employ and stood still to observe.</p><p>At this time, Crane Cry True Monarch, unable to locate Qin Sang, turned to Mo Xing Dao and cupped his hands. "Fellow Daoist Mo, have you separated from Su Zi Nan?"</p><p>During the teleportation array battle, Mo Xing Dao had helped Zhu Wu Dao escape.  There had been friction between them. Though Crane Cry True Monarch was displeased, he didn't show it outwardly, and his tone was relatively amicable.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Su has other matters to attend to," Mo Xing Dao replied silently, his responses consistently concise.</p><p>Crane Cry True Monarch frowned. "Fellow Daoist, you are not affiliated with any sect, yet you've achieved such accomplishments, free and unrestrained. This humble Daoist has long admired you.  But since you are not a member of the demonic sects, why do you repeatedly consort with those demonic fiends?"</p><p>He wanted to take this opportunity to persuade Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>This person had navigated the Northern Wasteland Demonic Territory. Although not entirely untainted, his ruthless methods were mostly used against his enemies, and he didn't have a particularly bad reputation.</p><p>"Mo…"</p><p>Mo Xing Dao suddenly stopped speaking.</p><p>Noticing the unusual look in Mo Xing Dao's eyes, Crane Cry True Monarch turned his head and discovered that his senior brother had withdrawn his divine ability and shifted his gaze, no longer focused on the medicinal garden.</p><p>"There are no heavenly treasures within the garden?"</p><p>Seeing that his senior brother seemed to have lost interest and intended to leave, Crane Cry True Monarch hastily transmitted his inquiry.</p><p>Purple Thunder True Monarch nodded slightly. "The fragrance should be a mixture of Myriad Mile Fragrance, Sweet Dew Bright昙… several fragrant spiritual herbs combined.  That's why the fragrance travels so far."</p><p>Hearing Purple Thunder True Monarch list these spiritual herb names, Crane Cry True Monarch immediately recalled their respective properties from his memory.  Indeed, they were all rare spiritual herbs, and their age must be extremely high.  Pills refined from them would possess at least supreme-grade potency.</p><p>If these spiritual herbs were found outside, they would be worth fighting over.</p><p>But how could they compare to the number one spiritual treasure of the Central Continent?</p><p>Of course, there might be even more precious heavenly materials and earthly treasures hidden within the medicinal garden, but the garden was surely filled with restrictions, making searching extremely troublesome.  If it delayed the competition for the spiritual treasure, it wouldn't be worth it.</p><p>He glanced at Mo Xing Dao from the corner of his eye.</p><p>Crane Cry True Monarch was somewhat reluctant. Such a vast treasure trove, and they were about to hand it over to someone else.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao felt a sense of foreboding and secretly became wary.</p><p>Purple Thunder True Monarch, well-versed in the art of making choices, didn't give Mo Xing Dao another glance and made a gesture to leave.</p><p>Just then, perhaps due to the continuous accumulation of wind煞 and the excessively violent impact, coupled with the spirit array being unattended for many years, the protective spirit array suddenly trembled.</p><p>Purple Thunder True Monarch's eyebrows twitched, and he abruptly turned around.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao and Crane Cry True Monarch also sensed something and looked towards the entrance of the medicinal garden.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The stone house at the entrance of the medicinal garden shook violently, almost collapsing. But the three of them weren't looking at the stone house but at the area above the stone wall.</p><p>Atop the hill, a transparent light barrier appeared out of thin air. As the barrier materialized, a green shadow abruptly emerged, clinging tightly to its surface.</p><p>It was a green vine, its base thick like a small tree, requiring no support to stand.</p><p>The green vine was brimming with vitality, its leaves lush and verdant. Beneath the layers of leaves, fruits seemed to have already formed, with two masses of milky white light shining through the gaps.</p><p>The light was gentle, carrying a peculiar allure, making one eager to investigate what kind of fruit it was.</p><p>The leaves pressed against the light barrier, their stems like the vine's tendrils, as if trying to pierce through the barrier.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Purple Thunder True Monarch was slightly startled, finding the vine somewhat familiar, yet unable to recall it immediately.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>The light membrane suddenly unleashed a bolt of lightning, striking the green vine fiercely.</p><p>The green vine reacted as if in pain, abruptly recoiling and falling to the ground, shrinking back and vanishing in an instant.</p><p>"A shapeshifting spiritual herb?"</p><p>Crane Cry True Monarch exclaimed, then negated his own words. "No, it's not a spiritual herb shapeshifting, but it has developed sentience and can move freely. There are sealing restrictions inside, and it wants to escape…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, Crane Cry True Monarch suddenly noticed that both his senior brother and Mo Xing Dao's expressions had changed, especially Mo Xing Dao, whose face was filled with joy and burgeoning greed.</p><p>Surprised, Crane Cry True Monarch immediately recalled the fleeting glimpse of the recoiling green vine.</p><p>The vine's fruit, round like a delicate bright moon, its spiritual light forming an illusion, as if depicting a celestial cassia moon palace, with celestial maidens dancing gracefully around the celestial fruit…</p><p>Crane Cry True Monarch's mouth opened slightly, his voice trembling.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>"Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit!"</p><p>Purple Thunder True Monarch's voice reached his ears.</p><p>A spark of inspiration, resonating with heavenly secrets!</p><p>Legend had it that this medicine was a rare heavenly material and earthly treasure even in ancient times, a superior immortal herb used for Divine Transformation.</p><p>Since entering the Formless Immortal Sect, this was the first time Purple Thunder True Monarch's expression had shown any fluctuation. He was merely a step away from Divine Transformation, but this step was like a chasm, requiring external force to bridge.</p><p>The Sword Tomb was undoubtedly the best choice.</p><p>Although the Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit was inferior to the Sword Tomb, it was still one of the few immortal herbs in this world, something even the Eight Sceneries Sect didn't possess.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Formless Immortal Sect actually harbored such a treasure!</p><p>Obtaining the Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit, he would have a great chance of achieving Divine Transformation and returning to his original plan.  As long as he could achieve Divine Transformation, all problems would be solved. Why bother painstakingly competing for the spiritual treasure?</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A muffled explosion echoed through the void.</p><p>A flash of purple light tore through the wind煞, and Purple Thunder True Monarch instantly appeared at the entrance of the medicinal garden.</p><p>Crane Cry True Monarch, sharing a deep understanding with Purple Thunder True Monarch, knew the importance of the Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit.  His first reaction was to prevent others from interfering.  He immediately summoned his Jade Smoke Flowing Stream, intending to block Mo Xing Dao. However, he suddenly sensed fluctuations in the wind煞 behind Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>Someone else had arrived!</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang, whose whereabouts were unknown, was definitely observing from the shadows. Seeing them breaking the spirit array, he would certainly be drawn over.</p><p>This meant they had at least three Grand Cultivators as competitors.</p><p>Even Crane Cry True Monarch, with his profound cultivation, felt this to be a tricky situation.</p><p>A moment's hesitation was enough for Mo Xing Dao to react.  He opened his mouth and spewed out profound energy, pointing it remotely at Crane Cry True Monarch. But instead of confronting him directly, he aimed it towards the side of the medicinal garden entrance.</p><p>Due to the impact of the wind煞, the protective spirit array had been constantly trembling.</p><p>During their confrontation, they had been secretly analyzing the spirit array and had already identified the most vulnerable spots, not limited to the entrance of the medicinal garden.</p><p>In a flash, Crane Cry True Monarch decided not to obstruct Mo Xing Dao.  His involvement would hasten the breaking of the array.  It would be best to capture the Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Vine before other opponents arrived, which would be more advantageous for them.</p><p>Seeing Mo Xing Dao's impassive expression, Crane Cry True Monarch took a deep look at him, inwardly admiring his courage.  His figure flickered, and he arrived beside Purple Thunder True Monarch.  The two senior and junior brothers joined forces to attack the spirit array.</p><p>Instantly, deafening roars erupted from the entrance of the medicinal garden.</p><p>A thunder mark appeared on Purple Thunder True Monarch's forehead, unleashing a furious barrage of purple lightning that continuously bombarded the mist formed by the spirit array.</p><p>Crane Cry True Monarch urged his Jade Smoke Flowing Stream to its limits, running parallel to the purple lightning, like two great rivers.  The abundant true essence contained within truly surged like torrential river waters.</p><p>Simultaneously, he raised his Azure Silk Umbrella in his other hand, warding off the residual waves of the spirit array's counterattack.</p><p>With the two True Monarchs displaying their divine might, Mo Xing Dao was not to be outdone.  His profound energy transformed into a myriad of forms, expanding to the size of a millstone, repeatedly smashing against the spirit array, each impact causing it to tremble violently.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The three Grand Cultivators attacked with all their might.</p><p>The violent impact transmitted inwards, causing the stone house to collapse first.</p><p>The light barrier at the top of the stone wall was also shaking, but it was extremely sturdy.  During this time, the green vine attacked once more, only to be repelled by the restrictions on the light barrier.</p><p>It seemed to instinctively sense the approaching danger and struggled desperately.</p><p>Next, the three of them employed treasures specifically designed for breaking restrictions.  After a violent tremor, the mist at the entrance of the medicinal garden was finally blasted open by the two True Monarchs, creating an opening.  The opening lasted only briefly, but it was enough for Purple Thunder True Monarch.</p><p>He saw a brilliant purple light emanating from Purple Thunder True Monarch's forehead.  The thunder mark detached and flew into the crack.  At the same time, Crane Cry True Monarch threw his Azure Silk Umbrella inside, and Mo Xing Dao also used his profound energy millstone to smash open the mist.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The entrance to the spirit array finally succumbed to the relentless assault, and the mist dispersed with a resounding boom, sending out shocking residual waves.</p><p>In an instant, two figures appeared atop the stone wall, near the light barrier.  However, the green vine was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao, unable to avoid the residual waves of the spirit array, appeared somewhat dishevelled and fell a step behind.  Just as he rushed into the medicinal garden, he saw Purple Thunder True Monarch extending his palm, infused with boundless purple lightning, pressing towards the light barrier.</p><p>Without any earth-shattering thunder, his palm passed directly through the light barrier, shattering it into fragments.</p><p>The two True Monarchs didn't hesitate for a moment.  They seized the opportunity to step through the light barrier and unleashed their divine senses, sweeping across the area with the most ferocious momentum.</p><p>The two cooperated seamlessly, each searching half of the area.  The area atop the mound was larger than expected, but with the two True Monarchs working together, it only took a moment.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao's expression shifted slightly, and he hurried up the stone wall.  Although he deliberately kept his distance, he could still feel the two True Monarchs locking onto him, the pressure intensifying dramatically.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment he reached the top of the mound, the two True Monarchs suddenly focused their attention on him. The fragments of the light barrier fluttering in front of him were coated with a layer of green light.</p><p>"The green vine!"</p><p>Mo Xing Dao's eyes narrowed. Before he could get a clear look, he instinctively channeled true essence into his palm, reaching out to grab what was before him.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Mo Xing Dao froze, his hand grasping at empty air.  The green vine shattered, clearly an illusion.</p><p>However, the two True Monarchs' attacks didn't cease.</p><p>The sound of thunder exploded in his ears, accompanied by the roar of crashing waves, undoubtedly the Jade Smoke Flowing Stream.</p><p>Simultaneously, a voice sounded from behind him, "Fellow Daoist, do you intend to monopolize the Immortal Fruit?"</p><p>It was the Venom King, who had just arrived and also witnessed the Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit.</p><p>Assaulted from three sides, the powerful true essences roared and clashed, deafeningly loud. Mo Xing Dao's figure was completely engulfed by the true essences.  Qin Sang, arriving from afar, also saw this scene, but his attention was elsewhere.</p><p>At this moment, another figure emerged behind the Venom King. Su Zi Nan was actually the last to arrive.</p><p>He had originally entered alongside Qin Sang, only slightly behind him on the Heavenly Stairway.  But Kun Dao knew he and Mo Xing Dao were accomplices and, fearing he would warn Mo Xing Dao, had used her methods to specifically target him, causing him to be even slower than the Venom King.</p><p>Qin Sang, being pursued by them, couldn't possibly warn Mo Xing Dao, so Kun Dao hadn't paid him any special attention.</p><p>In fact, Kun Dao's actions were completely unnecessary.  Su Zi Nan wasn't so kindhearted.</p><p>Su Zi Nan arrived, and the sight that greeted him was Mo Xing Dao being besieged. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>This scene was all too familiar!</p><p>The three of them were after the Immortal Fruit.  As long as Mo Xing Dao yielded, they probably wouldn't kill him. But what about adding Kun Dao, lurking in the shadows?</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mo, be careful!"</p><p>Su Zi Nan shouted.  His Demonic Banner appeared openly for the first time, but instead of helping to block the attacks, the two demonic souls went straight for Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting, and he was like a hunter vying for prey.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A metallic clang resonated.</p><p>Everyone watched in astonishment as a dark-skinned, strange figure replaced Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>Su Zi Nan's face darkened as well, practically gritting out four words: "Yuan Hou Puppet!"</p>
