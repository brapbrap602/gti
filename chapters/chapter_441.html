Chapter 434 Mu Yifeng


From a distance, a high-pitched shriek, though faint, was unusually sharp.
Qin Sang, remembering information from Xiong Li, felt a tightening in his chest.  He silently submerged, concealing his presence, and secretly observed.

Shortly after, a red streak of light sped in from the southwest, entering Qin Sang's field of vision.
Someone was flying on a magic sword!

Qin Sang suppressed his aura, remaining motionless, his gaze passing through the water to watch the streak of light. He then looked beyond it.

Sure enough, another white streak of light appeared shortly after, closely pursuing the red one.

Due to the distance, Qin Sang could only vaguely see the two streaks of light—one red, one white—chasing each other in the sky. He couldn't sense their auras.
However, judging by the momentum of their flight, he could roughly estimate their cultivation.  They were at least both late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators!

The red streak seemed unsteady, while the white one pursued relentlessly yet calmly, giving Qin Sang a feeling of unshakeable confidence, as if victory was already assured.

Could it be Tianxing League cultivators chasing after someone from Xiaohan Region?

The methods used by cultivators are largely similar; judging their identities by sight alone was impossible.

Qin Sang floated underwater, the Ten Directions Yama Banner in his hand. His gaze flickered, his expression hesitant as he watched the two streaks of light chase each other towards the northeast.

At that moment, a rumbling sound echoed from the direction the streaks of light had come from.

Qin Sang's expression changed. He turned his head and saw a treasure ship speeding towards them, trailing far behind the two streaks of light, also pursuing relentlessly.

The ship sailed on the water, its magical glow a dazzling spectacle, its intent to pursue undisguised.
The lake water was cleaved by the ship's passage, creating towering waves, forming two walls of water dozens of feet high.

The turbulent waves, the splashing water...Under the bright sun, he could vaguely see segments of seven-colored rainbows trailing behind the ship; the scene was breathtaking.

Even underwater, Qin Sang could feel the subtle impact from the waves.

Qin Sang looked closely, his gaze piercing through the water walls, vaguely making out the ship's form. It was simple: pointed at both ends, with a canopy in the middle. It was not large, resembling an ordinary covered boat from the mortal world.

But there were no oars, and no one was steering it.

A person stood at the bow; this person must be the master of the boat.

Furthermore, there were several figures at the stern, some seated, some standing.
Most of them looked upward, watching the two streaks of light chasing each other, their hands seeming to hold magical artifacts, ready for battle at any moment.

Due to the distance, Qin Sang couldn't even see their faces clearly, much less sense their cultivation levels.  But it was clear they were targeting the two streaks of light, and their strength was undoubtedly not weak, especially with so many of them.


“Which of these three forces is friend? Which is foe?”

A thoughtful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face.

If it were only the two streaks of light, after determining friend from foe, saving someone wouldn't be a problem; it would be a great accomplishment upon his return.  Qin Sang was confident; seizing the right moment, using surprise, even without the Ten Directions Yama Banner, slaying a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator wouldn't be difficult.

But if those on the covered boat were all Tianxing League experts, he would need to reconsider.


Just as Qin Sang hesitated...

‘Roar!’

A sudden roar pierced through his thoughts.

He looked up, following the sound, and saw that the leading red streak of light had stopped.

However, Qin Sang didn't see the figure within, because the streak suddenly expanded, transforming into a raging inferno, becoming a huge fireball in the air.

Flames quickly expanded outwards, and roars emanated from the heart of the fireball.

Hearing the roar, Qin Sang’s expression shifted; he felt a faint familiarity in the sound.

Then, the fireball violently shook, and several fiery dragons composed of flames burst from the inferno, circling the fireball. The dragons' bodies were crimson, soaring across the sky.

Their appearance was extraordinary, like true dragons.

There were nine of them—Nine Dragons Playing with a Pearl!

Surprise flooded Qin Sang's face.

The next moment, a powerful suction force emanated from within the fireball, instantly drawing in all the flames.  The dragons' bodies rapidly shrank, and a divine blade appeared!

A figure stood in the air, holding the blade, nine exquisitely crafted fiery dragons circling the blade, roaring at their enemies.

Seeing this divine blade, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, and an image immediately appeared in his mind.

Mu Yifeng!

The Nine Fire Divine Blade, Mu Yifeng's signature weapon.


He and Mu Yifeng met at Xuanlu Pass, sharing hardship. Though their time together was short, they clicked and became quite friendly.  After returning from the ancient cultivator's estate years ago, they parted outside Xuanlu Pass.  Decades passed before they met again, unexpectedly, with Mu Yifeng having come to Yun Cang Marsh.

His cultivation had also reached the late Foundation Establishment stage.

The Nine-Flamed Divine Blade was even more powerful than decades prior, showing it had been meticulously refined by Mu Yifeng over countless hours and with immense effort.  If it was Mu Yifeng, then his pursuers were undoubtedly cultivators from the Sky Walk League!

Mu Yifeng stood proudly in mid-air, eyes bloodshot, glaring at his enemies, his hands gripping the Nine-Flamed Divine Blade. Seemingly resigned to his fate, he resolved to fight to the death, frantically pouring spiritual energy into his weapon.

The Nine-Flamed Divine Blade emitted an astonishing fire power, its material transforming into something like jade, releasing dazzling crimson light.  The surrounding water was dyed red by the blade's glow, as if ignited.

“Kill!”

Mu Yifeng’s voice was hoarse as he roared. The Nine-Flamed Divine Blade flew from his hand, swift as lightning, unstoppable as a thunderbolt!

Seeing Mu Yifeng's desperate attack, the pursuer, locked onto by the Divine Blade, didn't dare to be careless. He halted his escape, threw out a purple crystal bottle, and muttered incantations.

The bottle inverted, its mouth aimed at the Nine-Flamed Divine Blade. A purple glow erupted, blocking the blade's path.

‘Pfft!’

The two weapons collided, yet silently. The purple glow, like a soft cloud, was instantly indented where struck by the Divine Blade.  The glow was consumed, visibly diminishing, though the bottle continued to replenish it,  far too slowly to counter the blade's assault.

The Nine-Flamed Divine Blade's momentum was only slightly checked; its power remained unmatched.

Seeing this, the Sky Walk League cultivator gritted his teeth, sharply tapping the purple crystal bottle. The bottle trembled slightly, then directly charged towards the Divine Blade to obstruct it.

Both were powerful cultivators, their battle incredibly fast.  In the blink of an eye,  Qin Sang realized the pursued man was Mu Yifeng, just as the two weapons clashed.  Qin Sang could clearly see Mu Yifeng's dire state. Even if the Nine-Flamed Divine Blade somehow killed his opponent, he wouldn't be able to escape the pursuing warship.
