<h1>Chapter 2030:  Subservience</h1><p>Elder San's spiritual sense, though not as keen as the two Void Refinement cultivators, instantly realized something was amiss when he saw their reactions and Young Master Xin's terrifyingly calm gaze.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A long whip flew out from Elder San's sleeve.  The crimson whip shadow lashed fiercely towards Young Master Xin, the attack completely merciless.</p><p>As the whip shadow approached, Young Master Xin didn't even blink.  Elder San suddenly felt his entire body tighten, let out a muffled groan, and was kicked out of Ming Ling's body.</p><p>The whip shadow's might was astonishing, but it was no match for Ming Ling's power. Both the whip and its master were flung away, unable to harm Young Master Xin in the slightest.</p><p>At this moment, Zhong Liang the Recluse and Attendant Pei also abandoned their fight.</p><p>Young Master Xin's figure gradually faded, as if an invisible door existed in the void, and she was about to pass through it. If Young Master Xin were merely escaping, their reaction wouldn't be so intense.</p><p>But Young Master Xin had been plotting for a long time, using herself as bait and manipulating Elder San to lure them all here.  Clearly, she had far greater ambitions. For Young Master Xin to do this, unless she wasn't worried about future reprisals against the Xin Clan, she certainly wouldn't dare let them leave alive!</p><p>For a mere Nascent Soul cultivator to dare scheme against two Void Refinement cultivators simultaneously sounded preposterous, yet it was truly happening to them.</p><p>They didn't understand how Young Master Xin had managed it, but an ominous premonition grew increasingly strong. The two Void Refinement cultivators felt an unprecedented, immense crisis closing in on them!</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>Attendant Pei was enraged. He had just appeared to have everything under control, but in the blink of an eye, he'd been slapped in the face by Young Master Xin.</p><p>Zhong Liang the Recluse withdrew his golden sword, allowing Attendant Pei to fully control the Abyssal Yang Infinite Formation. Abandoning the attempt to capture Ming Ling alive, nine suns hung in the air, emitting a blazing light. The entire formation's power surged madly towards the nine great suns.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Streams of fire erupted from the suns, rushing towards Ming Ling and Young Master Xin. The terrifying heat seemed capable of igniting even the void itself.</p><p>Before the fire streams even arrived, flames had already ignited on Ming Ling's body.</p><p>Elder San, caught in the crossfire, lost Ming Ling's protection and truly experienced the power of the Abyssal Yang Infinite Formation. Even though the fire streams weren't directed at him, he felt as though he was about to be baked into a dried husk.</p><p>At the same time, Zhong Liang the Recluse also made his move. The nine-story pagoda trembled slightly, each story emitting a ripple of dark golden light, dyeing the entire pagoda a dark gold color.</p><p>To the naked eye, the pagoda seemed to have become countless times heavier, smashing down fiercely.</p><p>Even if a mountain were below, the pagoda could pulverize the peak. If Ming Ling were struck, serious injury was inevitable, and Young Master Xin, hiding within Ming Ling's body, would also be in grave danger.</p><p>The pagoda, the fire streams—any one of these attacks could easily obliterate any Nascent Soul cultivator.  Their first collaboration was actually to deal with a mere Nascent Soul cultivator, an undeniable irony.</p><p>With the aura of death approaching, Young Master Xin's face showed no panic, her gaze icy and resolute.</p><p>“Haven't the two seniors always desired Ming Ling? Today, I gift it to you!”</p><p>Ming Ling roared, pure darkness flowing from its body, instantly filling its limbs and bones. Its body melted into a pool of black water, from which arms stretched out, grasping at its enemies, as if trying to drag them into a dark abyss.</p><p>Black figures rushed out along the arms. In an instant, Ming Ling transformed into thousands, frantically charging towards its enemies.  This scene resembled a frenzied dance of ten thousand demons. These demonic shadows shattered and exploded before the fire streams and the pagoda, but the black water surged endlessly, making the void itself viscous.</p><p>At this moment, Ming Ling erupted with unimaginable power. The cost, of course, was enormous. Everyone present could sense that Ming Ling was consuming its essence at a terrifying rate, an act no different from self-destruction.</p><p>To deal with them, Young Master Xin was actually willing to let the Xin Clan's inherited Ming Ling be destroyed here, perishing together with them!</p><p>Ming Ling protected its master, and they ultimately failed to stop Young Master Xin.</p><p>Young Master Xin's figure completely faded and vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a black stone inscribed with strange, unfamiliar runes.</p><p>Attendant Pei and Zhong Liang the Recluse simultaneously looked at the black stone, an extremely dangerous feeling rising in their hearts.</p><p>Neither had the leisure to bother with Elder San, which allowed him to save his life. Elder San was desperately fleeing. His strength was far inferior to the two Void Refinement cultivators. Once Young Master Xin’s scheme succeeded, the two Void Refinement cultivators might have a chance to survive, but he would surely die!</p><p>Waves of residual energy washed over him. Elder San was like a rootless duckweed, clenching his teeth.  Just as he was about to escape the battlefield,</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The void trembled continuously.</p><p>Elder San’s heart skipped a beat, and then he saw a terrifying sight.</p><p>The sky collapsed!</p><p>Several islands ahead emitted cracking sounds, instantly covered in fissures as countless boulders tumbled down.</p><p>As the islands shattered, the void seemed to cave in, the dense black clouds above losing their support.</p><p>The center of the collapse was right behind him. Black clouds surged madly from all directions. Elder San clearly saw streams of black clouds descending from the sky. This wasn’t merely black clouds; it meant that the entire island mountain formation was being destroyed, and the violent energy generated by the destruction was surging towards him.</p><p>At the center of the formation, black clouds collapsed, and a waterfall of clouds churned. This was the heart of the cloud waterfall, the heart of destruction!</p><p>It was too late for Elder San to escape. He was engulfed by the cloud streams, his protective true qi instantly shattering as he coughed up blood, gravely injured in an instant.</p><p>The destructive power of the collapsing formation was too terrifying, capable of destroying everything.</p><p>At this moment, Elder San vaguely saw two figures.  Attendant Pei and Zhong Liang the Recluse were also frantically rushing outwards, but they were repeatedly forced back by the cloud waterfall, plunging him into despair.</p><p>Deep within the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was drawn behind him. He saw islands shattering and collapsing, black clouds surging towards a single point.</p><p>That place seemed to have a deep pit, the lowest point, towards which the black clouds flowed endlessly. Qin Sang saw the black clouds form a torrential current, vast and mighty, pouring down from the sky. The destructive storm continued to spread, a magnificent spectacle.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang understood. The formation wasn’t collapsing from the outside in. The periphery was the origin of the destruction; the formation was collapsing inwards, the destructive energy converging there.</p><p>That place was the most dangerous; his current location was relatively safe. Perhaps he didn’t need to hide in the Thousand Kilogram Ring.</p><p>But why was the formation collapsing?  The origin of the destruction wasn't here, so perhaps the Thousand Kilogram Ring had little to do with it.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed. He suddenly glimpsed a figure.</p><p>This person appeared inexplicably, standing atop a crumbling island peak.  It was Young Master Xin!</p><p>Young Master Xin stared at the cloud pit, her expression somewhat tense.  Sensing the increasingly violent energy there, as expected, she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Young Master Xin's expression relaxed slightly, then suddenly froze, because she also saw Qin Sang in the distance.</p><p>Her eyes widened, seemingly unable to believe she would see Qin Sang here.</p><p>This was deep within the formation. Qin Sang should have been in the canyon refining the ferry. Even if he had sensed the danger in advance, he should have escaped towards the outside of the formation.</p><p>Now, with the formation’s destruction in full swing, Attendant Pei and Zhong Liang the Recluse would undoubtedly perish.  The destructive storm would continue for a long time before subsiding, forming a natural barrier, isolating the inside from the outside.</p><p>Logically, Qin Sang should have no way of entering.</p><p>Qin Sang saw Young Master Xin's expression and his heart stirred. Could it be that Young Master Xin was the one who triggered the formation's collapse?</p><p>Young Master Xin's subsequent actions surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>She quickly regained her composure and actually flew towards him, her expression normal, bowing respectfully. “Greetings, Elder Qin!  This junior is relieved to see that you are unharmed.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, his words pregnant with meaning. “Young Master Xin didn’t expect to see this old man here either, did you?”</p><p>Young Master Xin faltered.</p><p>“Young Master Xin, what a grand undertaking!”</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep look at Young Master Xin, then turned to look at the cloud pit, sighing. “This time, I fear Attendant Pei’s chances of survival are slim.”</p><p>His sigh was heartfelt.</p><p>Even if Young Master Xin appeared composed, her previous change in expression was enough for Qin Sang to discern some clues.</p><p>He had long since noticed the subtle relationship between Attendant Pei and the Xin Clan, but he hadn't expected Young Master Xin to dare kill Attendant Pei.</p><p>If he knew that Zhong Liang the Recluse, a Void Refinement mid-stage cultivator, was also killed, he would be even more astonished.</p><p>Young Master Xin was silent for a moment, then nodded. “If nothing unexpected happens, Attendant Pei should perish here.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Young Master Xin with some surprise.</p><p>He could see that Young Master Xin seemed somewhat weakened, and the Ming Ling behind her was gone. Even without knowing the details, Qin Sang could guess that controlling a powerful entity like Ming Ling must come at a price for a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>For this woman to still maintain this composure in front of him was truly exceptional.</p><p>“Aren't you disappointed that you couldn’t kill this old man along with them?” Qin Sang’s tone was calm, but a murderous intent lurked beneath.</p><p>“Elder Qin is discerning!”</p><p>Young Master Xin quickly explained, “This junior’s invitation for Elder Qin to refine tools was not a lie.  Furthermore, this junior did indeed intend to use Elder Qin, but only to attract Attendant Pei’s attention, to distract him so that he would neglect this junior, thus leading him into the trap. This junior has no grievances with Elder Qin and never intended to harm you. Otherwise, this junior would not have deliberately left you in the canyon.”</p><p>She pointed towards the cloud pit.  “Senior can surely see that only by being at the very center during the collapse could you have been trapped.  This junior went to great lengths, even using myself as bait, to trap and kill Attendant Pei, and the canyon is still some distance from there. With Senior’s spiritual sense and strength, once you sensed the anomaly, you would certainly have been able to escape, perhaps a little disheveled, but never in mortal danger!”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, sensing the fluctuations coming from afar.  He knew that Young Master Xin’s words were somewhat credible. If he had stayed in the canyon and reacted quickly enough, escaping towards the outside of the formation, he likely would have gotten away.</p><p>However, these explanations were not enough.</p><p>“Young Master Xin is truly a remarkable woman. This old man has no certainty of victory against Attendant Pei, yet he died at your hands.  However, the price must have been considerable, no?”</p><p>He remained noncommittal, his gaze sweeping over Young Master Xin, probing.</p><p>Young Master Xin understood Qin Sang's implication. After a long silence, she suddenly took a deep breath and nodded heavily.</p><p>“Elder Qin has a keen eye! Indeed, this junior paid a heavy price for this, leaving Ming Ling there to perish with them.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed.  He had assumed Ming Ling was severely injured, or that Young Master Xin was in a weakened state and temporarily unable to control it.  He hadn't expected it to perish along with Attendant Pei.</p><p>Did Young Master Xin reveal this directly out of desperation? However, even if she wanted to hide it, it would be futile.  As soon as he made a move, the truth would be revealed.</p><p>By voluntarily revealing Ming Ling's self-destruction, she was indicating that she and the Xin Clan no longer posed a threat to him, so he needn’t rush to attack her. He could patiently listen to her continue, perhaps there was room for maneuver. She was indeed clever.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't immediately attack, not entirely because of her words, but because he noticed that amidst the formation’s collapse, strange lights frequently flashed in the deepest part of the formation, revealing unusual phenomena.</p><p>Clearly, there were secrets hidden here.</p><p>Young Master Xin's actions were likely a plan to kill two birds with one stone.  She must have had ulterior motives for coming here alone.</p><p>She could manipulate the formation’s self-destruction, indicating a deep understanding of this place, which could be useful to him.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, Young Master Xin then solemnly declared, “Having lost Ming Ling, the Xin Clan has no one to rely on.  This junior is willing to lead the Xin Clan in subservience to Elder Qin, to be at your command!”</p><p>“Subservience?”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.  “This old man has no desire to follow in Attendant Pei's footsteps.”</p><p>Young Master Xin sighed softly. “To be frank with Elder Qin, it wasn't just Attendant Pei whom this junior trapped and killed, but also Zhong Liang the Recluse.”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  Did this Zhong Liang the Recluse also happen to be a Void Refinement cultivator?</p><p>To kill two Void Refinement cultivators at once, even he couldn't achieve that. He truly had to look at this Young Master Xin with new eyes.</p><p>“This gamble risked the fate of the entire Xin Clan. If not forced, this junior would not have taken such a risk. After my father’s death, the Xin Clan faced internal and external troubles, precariously balanced.  Zhong Liang the Recluse even intended to swallow the Xin Clan's foundation, forcing this junior to seek refuge with Attendant Pei.</p><p>“However, although Attendant Pei had some past friendship with my father, he also harbored ulterior motives, coveting both the Xin Clan and this junior.</p><p>“He cultivated a Daoist art that he could never perfect, and it just so happened that a secret art passed down in my family subtly resonated with his Daoist art. He intended to wait until this junior mastered the secret art and then force me to become his cauldron. Becoming his concubine might have been my best outcome, but more likely, I would have been harmed by him.</p><p>“Most importantly… Ming Ling was born with a flaw. It has guarded the Xin Clan for many years and is nearing its limit.  Its time is running out. We tried every means, but we couldn’t extend Ming Ling's lifespan!”</p><p>Young Master Xin sighed. “Without Ming Ling, this junior and the Xin Clan are at the mercy of others. Attendant Pei would only become more unscrupulous.  These years, we have exhausted the entire clan’s resources to satisfy Attendant Pei’s appetite.  If he had treated me with sincerity, why would this junior resort to such desperate measures, resulting in mutual destruction?!”</p><p>Faced with Young Master Xin's accusations, Qin Sang remained unmoved.  "How do you know this old man isn’t another Attendant Pei?”</p><p>“Does Elder Qin think this junior has any other choice?”</p><p>Young Master Xin countered.</p><p>"The Xin Clan cannot help Elder Qin much, but we can handle some minor matters for you.  Although Attendant Pei and Zhong Liang the Recluse perished, and their treasures were destroyed along with them, their domains still remain, now ownerless.  Elder Qin will certainly need people to help manage them…"</p>
