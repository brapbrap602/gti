<h1>Chapter 145: The Ancient Divine Platform</h1><p>Qin Sang trailed far behind, noticing Venerable Ye seemed to be searching for something. He led Su Nü and the others almost in a full circle around the Hundred Treasures region before finally stopping.</p><p>Before them stood an unremarkable hill.</p><p>Venerable Ye paused, his eyes scanning the hill.</p><p>Lush vegetation covered the hill, shaded by green trees. A few wild beasts roamed the slopes, and the scene was pristine, untouched by human hands.  Looking down at the talisman in his hand, he carefully sensed for a moment, then nodded slightly. “This is it!”</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the others were confused, unsure what their master was searching for.</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>Venerable Ye produced several talismans.</p><p>The disciples took them and saw each was inscribed with a black dragon.</p><p>Then, Venerable Ye turned to Su Nü. “Su Nü, come here.”</p><p>Su Nü's heart tightened. Suppressing her unease, she stepped forward and bowed. “Disciple is here, Master Ye. What are your instructions?”</p><p>“We need to break a restriction. Your cultivation method is unique. Listen to my commands…”</p><p>Venerable Ye gave her a few instructions.</p><p>Su Nü, filled with suspicion, nodded silently.</p><p>After giving his instructions, Venerable Ye stepped forward, casually slaying the wild beasts within.  He circled the hill in flight, finally hovering on the western side.</p><p>He looked down, staring at the hill. Suddenly, his hands began to form seals, releasing a stream of hand gestures.</p><p>Spiritual energy vibrated.</p><p>Countless runes floated above the hill, forming an incredibly complex restriction. After a long while, Venerable Ye stopped, retrieving over a dozen formation flags, which he drove one by one into the restriction.</p><p>His breath came in ragged gasps; he had expended a great deal of energy.</p><p>Now, the outline of the restriction was visible.  A complex flag formation floated in the void, exuding a majestic aura. Since it wasn't activated, its purpose remained unknown for the time being.</p><p>“Go there.”</p><p>Venerable Ye pointed to the edge of the restriction.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the other two disciples took positions at three different points around the restriction's edge.  Su Nü, following Venerable Ye's command, flew forward and hovered at the restriction's boundary.</p><p>Then, Venerable Ye took out a jade pendant and suddenly unsealed his cultivation!</p><p>An astonishing pressure instantly filled the void, pressing down on Venerable Ye. The very air seemed to distort.</p><p>Venerable Ye stood in mid-air, unsupported.</p><p>His aura surged as his cultivation was restored, but the pain he endured intensified.  His bones cracked, and fissures appeared on his skin, worsening his injuries.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Venerable Ye gritted his teeth and crushed the jade pendant.</p><p>A burst of rosy light erupted.</p><p>Bathed in the rosy light, Venerable Ye's expression eased.  The light seemed to shield him from the pressure of the secret realm.</p><p>However, there was only one jade pendant, and its power was limited.  Venerable Ye didn't hesitate. He flashed to the center of the flag formation, sat cross-legged, and began to rapidly form hand seals.</p><p>*Hummm…*</p><p>The restriction activated, and the spiritual formation began to function.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Venerable Ye shouted softly.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the others were ready. At his command, they immediately activated the talismans in their hands.</p><p>Suddenly, dragon roars echoed through the mountains.</p><p>Four black dragons roared into existence, each over ten zhang long.  Their divine eyes held an imposing power, and their formidable auras created a gale that raged through the mountains.</p><p>Hidden on a distant mountain, Qin Sang witnessed this scene.</p><p>His eyes gleamed; the scene seemed familiar.</p><p>He quickly recalled.</p><p>When he first entered the Seven Kills Hall, he had to perform a task for the East Pole Alliance, accompanying Xiang Yi into the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the others had also used talismans to summon black dragons to suppress the backlash of the ancient divine platform’s thunder chains, eventually breaking the platform’s restriction.</p><p>This situation was very similar.</p><p>Only, the dragons here were much larger and more powerful than the ones before.</p><p>The black dragons were unruly.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the others struggled, finding it difficult to control the dragons.  Only Su Nü appeared at ease, the black dragon circling above her, docile and obedient.</p><p>“Is there Demonic Qi sealed in the talisman?” Su Nü sensed a familiar aura from the black dragon – it was the Demonic Qi she cultivated. Just then, Venerable Ye's voice echoed in her ear, “Activate your cultivation method and do as I say…”</p><p>Su Nü dared not disobey Venerable Ye and meticulously followed his commands.</p><p>With Su Nü's help, the other three black dragons became more manageable.</p><p>Finally, all the black dragons whined and plunged into the great formation.</p><p>A muffled thunderous boom reverberated as the formation blazed with light, merging with the black dragons to form a giant sword of light that stabbed down towards the hill!</p><p>With the power of the light sword, piercing the hill should have been easy.</p><p>But a surprising scene unfolded.</p><p>A brilliant golden light suddenly erupted from the hill, forming a hemispherical barrier.  Within the golden light, the outline of a massive divine platform faintly appeared.</p><p>“The Ancient Divine Platform!”</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze. “No! It only looks similar, but it's grander than the one in the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, and the runes on it are more complex. But it's certain that the two platforms are connected…”</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Venerable Ye roared, slamming his palm downwards.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The light sword struck the golden barrier.</p><p>The barrier was some kind of seal. The golden light was dazzling, and the mountains trembled, but the ancient stone platform within remained unmoved.</p><p>The seal was exceptionally strong, and the light sword failed to penetrate it.</p><p>But as the two forces were locked in a stalemate, Venerable Ye flicked his other hand, sending a talisman fluttering down.  It seemed slow but was surprisingly fast, lightly sticking to the surface of the golden barrier.</p><p>At the same time, the Demonic Qi black dragons lunged at the talisman.</p><p>With a humming sound, the black dragons coiled around the talisman, which pierced through the golden barrier at the tip of the light sword.</p><p>Inside the barrier, the platform's restrictions were triggered.  Four iron chains transformed into shimmering silver, and countless lightning bolts shot up from below. The chains were thunder chains, but their power far surpassed those of the platform in the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The black dragons were engulfed by the thunder, their Demonic Qi dispersing, their forms shrinking visibly, but they successfully protected the talisman.</p><p>Finally, the talisman landed on the divine platform.</p><p>Venerable Ye let out a long breath and formed a hand seal. The light sword shattered. The formation flags, now covered in cracks, had lost their power and were clearly unusable.</p><p>Then, the golden light and the image of the divine platform vanished.</p><p>Only the scarred hill remained, a testament to the extraordinary events that had just transpired.</p><p>“It is done. We can leave.”</p><p>The rosy light around Venerable Ye dissipated, and he resealed his cultivation.</p><p>He coughed a few times, his face flushing, his body unsteady.</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>Su Nü was stunned.</p><p>She thought the merchant alliance intended to harm her, perhaps using her as a sacrifice again.  Driven by the desire to escape and save herself, she had not only colluded with outsiders to steal the Soul Cleansing Liquid but also ambushed and interrogated her senior brother.</p><p>Unexpectedly, that wasn't the case at all.  The merchant alliance only needed her Demonic Qi to suppress the black dragons.</p><p>All her efforts seemed so ridiculous.</p><p>Bitterness welled up in Su Nü’s heart.</p>
