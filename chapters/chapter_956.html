<h1>Chapter 948: Searching for the Heavenly Corpse Sect</h1><p>Chapter 948: Searching for the Heavenly Corpse Sect</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you think so too?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed, realizing Bai’s thoughts mirrored his own.</p><p>Since entering the cultivation world, especially after arriving at the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang’s perspective had broadened considerably.  After obtaining the “Heavenly Demon Transformation”, “Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique”, and “Controlling Thunder Technique”, he discovered that these top-tier ancient cultivation techniques and secret arts were all incomplete.  </p><p>Later cultivators could only patch them up, or find ways to resolve the inherent flaws, before they could cultivate them.</p><p>The “Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual” was unique, quite different from other corpse refinement techniques. Refining living corpses was only one aspect. It utilized earth煞 energy, and by gathering various spirit objects, it could refine powerful corpses without consuming vast amounts of time and effort.  Other corpse refinement techniques, however, required a crucial corpse-nurturing step.</p><p>If Qin Sang had obtained one of those techniques, given his tragically deficient aptitude, he wouldn't have had the time to focus on cultivation, let alone corpse refinement.</p><p>Such a strange secret art must have a complex origin; perhaps it was no less significant than the “Chapter on Nurturing Swords with the Yuan Shen” and others.</p><p>After exchanging ideas with many corpse refinement Daoists, Qin Sang suspected that the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s ancestor might have obtained some ancient secret technique, which he then incorporated into his corpse refinement techniques, creating the “Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual.”  Or perhaps, this secret technique itself was unique, encompassing both corpse refinement and other Dao paths.</p><p>Bai’s thoughts coincided with Qin Sang's.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, from which sect did you obtain the ‘Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual’? If we saw the sect’s classics, perhaps we could find some clues.” Bai continued.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated before saying, “To be honest, Fellow Daoist, the ‘Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual’ did not originate from the Canglang Sea. I obtained it unexpectedly elsewhere. The sect was called the Heavenly Corpse Sect, and it has been defunct for many years.  Some fellow Daoists and I stumbled upon the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s ruins. Besides the Heavenly Corpse Order, we found no other classics.  To uncover the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s origins, I must return. Whether I can find anything is another matter…”</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>Bai lowered his head, a thoughtful expression on his face, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, do you have a way to temporarily suppress the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?” Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Bai glanced at the mute woman and said, “Fellow Daoist, are you worried about her? You only need to do two things: preserve her physical vitality and her consciousness. Her body is filled with incredibly rich vitality. Suppressing the corpse energy to the minimum would require some kind of top-tier elixir, I imagine? If this body of mine weren't beyond repair, I would ask for one from you myself.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Bai.</p><p>Except for the one he’d given to Jiu Huan Tian Lan, the remaining Three Lights Jade Liquid could only be used as a restorative elixir.</p><p>He hadn't needed it in previous perilous situations, but that didn't diminish its importance.  After using the “Sacrificial Thunder Technique,” his true energy was nearly depleted.  Consuming the Three Lights Jade Liquid would quickly restore his combat capabilities; that was his current greatest trump card.</p><p>Of course, if Bai was willing to trade nourishing soul wood for Three Lights Jade Liquid, it wasn’t impossible.</p><p>“With this vitality nourishing her, her physical body is safe. As for her spirit, Fellow Daoist, you already have nourishing soul wood. What is there to worry about? Just keep a piece of wood on her, and we’ll find a solution later.”</p><p>Bai said indifferently.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered; it seemed they could only take their time.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Bai sighed, “Without the complete secret technique, I can only seek other methods to solve this problem. If I truly cannot break the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, I would ask Fellow Daoist to take me with you to search for the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Helping me is also helping yourself; what do you think, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, “Fellow Daoist means…”</p><p>Bai nodded, “With my corpse-refined body, it would be difficult to blend into the mortal world. Furthermore, I know nothing of the outside world.  Temporarily staying with Fellow Daoist, while trying to restore my strength and becoming familiar with the mortal world, would be a good choice.  However, we would need to make a further oath.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, “Fellow Daoist had this plan all along, didn’t you? Quite a good strategy.  In the Ghostland, you intended to use this as a bargaining chip.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect Fellow Daoist to be so astute. I had to offer the nourishing soul wood to get you to agree.”</p><p>Bai retorted, then changed his tone.  “Fellow Daoist, you went to such lengths to save this woman. Clearly, you are not a vicious person; otherwise, I wouldn’t have this idea. We have this understanding: I will stay by your side, and when we are in danger, I will act appropriately, helping you overcome the difficulties.  But if Fellow Daoist deliberately enters danger, or asks me to lure the enemy, I will not comply.  Also, Fellow Daoist must promise to search for the Heavenly Corpse Sect as soon as possible…”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed, “Fellow Daoist needn’t urge me. I actually want to return more than you. My future plans are related to this matter.”</p><p>Qin Sang naturally welcomed Bai’s willingness to stay by his side.  Bai’s strength was secondary; it was his mysterious origins and lost memories that Qin Sang valued most.</p><p>"That's good!"</p><p>Bai's expression softened.  "I'll go into the Corpse Puppet Bag to meditate.  Friend, you should carefully consider how to safely leave Seven Kills Hall…"</p><p>"Wait," Qin Sang stopped Bai, surprised. "Aren't you going to explore Seven Kills Hall?  Perhaps it could trigger your memories. You and so many spirits are trapped here; there must be a reason. You may have had a significant connection to Seven Kills Hall in your life."</p><p>Bai looked around. "It's clear that Seven Kills Hall is dangerous and fraught with peril. My strength hasn't recovered yet; wandering around could be risky. As long as you don't seal the Corpse Puppet Bag, I can still sense what's outside… I'll explore after my strength has returned."</p><p>"Very well!"</p><p>Qin Sang considered this and nodded in agreement.</p><p>After putting Ya Gu and Bai into the Corpse Puppet Bag, Qin Sang took one last look towards the wasteland before turning and entering the deep mountains.</p><p>He intended to return to the Sky Tower and try the Sword Path again.</p><p>He wanted to see what lay beyond the Sword Path, and if the ancient teleportation array was truly there!</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang took out his map. After traveling for a while in the deep mountains and confirming his location, he deliberately deviated from his course, planning to detour to the crevice where the Hegemonic Blood Fruits grew to take a look.</p><p>Hegemonic Blood Fruits are top-grade body-refining herbs; one can never have too many.</p><p>This time, it wouldn't take long before his cultivation and physique both broke through.  By then, armed with top-tier treasures and secret techniques, he should be able to fight a Nascent Soul stage cultivator, right?</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang felt a surge of excitement.</p><p>Last time, he hadn't over-harvested. He only picked five nearly ripe fruits; a bunch of small green fruits remained on the vine. Decades have passed; I wonder if any new fruits have ripened.</p><p>A flock of red-tailed cranes guarded the Hegemonic Blood Fruits. Qin Sang had tested their strength last time.</p><p>As long as there's no beast king among the red-tailed cranes, taking the herbs should be easy.</p><p>Qin Sang continued through the deep mountains.</p><p>Though his strength far surpassed his previous self, he remained extremely cautious, actively avoiding any unusual occurrences.</p>
