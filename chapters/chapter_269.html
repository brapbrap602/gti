<h1>Chapter 262: Severed Arm</h1><p>Chapter 262: Severed Arm</p><p>After Jin-mang destroyed the Nine Dragons Heaven Carriage Talisman,</p><p>The copper bell shattered with a 'snap', golden light dissipated, becoming a talisman covered with cracks, with its debris scattering down like snowflakes.</p><p>It turned out to be a talisman-treasure.</p><p>The copper bell's power was far greater than the jade wishful talisman in Qin-Sang's hand, which was why it could so easily destroy the Nine Dragons Heaven Carriage Talisman. The magic treasure of its true form was certainly not simple.</p><p>When the talisman-treasure's power was exhausted, it shattered after being used once, but destroying the Nine Dragons Heaven Carriage Talisman and completely cutting off the Daoist Xuan-Yu's path of retreat was a good use of it.</p><p>Qin-Sang nodded secretly. He had heard before that it was not bad for a Core Formation cultivator to have a magic treasure at their side. Many Core Formation cultivators, especially those without a powerful background, had to rush about for many years for their own lifebound magic treasures in order to barely gather enough spiritual materials. They simply did not have the energy to refine other magic treasures.</p><p>Unless they had good luck, finding it when exploring a treasure, or killing another Core Formation cultivator to seize it.</p><p>Daoist Di-Que's background was far inferior to Daoist Xuan-Yu's.</p><p>Daoist Xuan-Yu had a lifebound magic treasure in the form of a lush green disk, a Celestial Fiend Blade Talisman with power comparable to a magic treasure, and it was suspected that he had an inner landscape talisman that had yet to be revealed.</p><p>In addition, the power of the Nine Dragons Heaven Carriage Talisman had not been fully displayed before it was destroyed by the copper bell, but judging from Daoist Xuan-Yu's escape speed, this secret talisman was probably also of the rank of a magic treasure.</p><p>The reason he could have so many treasures was precisely because of his status as a disciple of the Shang-Yuan Pure Brightness Palace.</p><p>Daoist Di-Que, on the other hand, was actually a casual cultivator who merely held the title of a guest elder in Xuan-Lan Pass. It was hard to say whether he had any real power.</p><p>When Qin-Sang saw that Daoist Di-Que not only had the Heavenly Sound Conch, but had also sacrificed a powerful copper bell, he had been somewhat surprised at how rich his assets were. Only now did he learn that they were talisman-treasures.</p><p>It was evident that Daoist Di-Que, whether in terms of cultivation or background, was much weaker than Daoist Xuan-Yu. Taking advantage of the surprise attack, and adding in his plans, he had successively destroyed Daoist Xuan-Yu's three treasures, forcing him into a desperate situation.</p><p>The copper bell had been shattered, but before Daoist Xuan-Yu could make another move, Daoist Di-Que seized the opportunity to close in on him, blocking Daoist Xuan-Yu's path forward.</p><p>The Heavenly Sound Conch was gently shaken, causing countless sound blades immediately to shoot out, pouring down like a rainstorm. Not only did they engulf Daoist Xuan-Yu, they also completely covered the area around him, without a single gap, giving him no chance to dodge.</p><p>Curiously, Daoist Xuan-Yu made no attempt to struggle, his body drowning in the storm made up of sound blades. It was unknown whether he had already lost all power to fight back. By now he was certainly riddled with wounds.</p><p>Daoist Di-Que was also rather taken aback, but this was immediately followed by an upsurge of excitement.</p><p>Just as he was urging his spiritual energy to continue to increase the Heavenly Sound Conch's power, a blade light suddenly and silently ripped through the storm, shooting out with great speed.</p><p>Its target was Daoist Di-Que!</p><p>The blade light's speed was extremely astonishing. In an instant, it drew close to Daoist Di-Que, leaving a long, narrow blade shadow in the void.</p><p>The Celestial Blade had descended, stunning all who beheld it.</p><p>This blade light had appeared without the slightest warning, but was even more brilliant than the outbreak of the Celestial Fiend Blade Talisman just now. The naked eye could not see what the blade light's true form was.</p><p>The undulations of the blade light were identical to that of the Celestial Fiend Blade Talisman, but hidden within the Celestial Fiend Blade Talisman's undulations was another, more powerful and violent energy!</p><p>This blade was not aimed at Qin-Sang, but the mere remnant ripples of its power spread out, causing Qin-Sang to be greatly shocked, even feeling a kind of trembling sensation!</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, his vision filled with a milky whiteness. Suddenly, he remembered the night he had left the Yuan-Zhao Sect.</p><p>"Burning the golden core?"</p><p>When the blade talisman arrived, Daoist Di-Que's expression was solemn, but in the depths of his eyes there was a trace of delight imperceptible to outsiders.</p><p>Qin-Sang also realized that, knowing he was doomed, Daoist Xuan-Yu had actually chosen to burn the power of his golden core, overdrawing the Celestial Fiend Blade Talisman to fight desperately. No wonder he was able to suddenly erupt with such terrifying power.</p><p>This was a counterattack against impossible odds, possibly Daoist Xuan-Yu's only chance.</p><p>However, even if Daoist Xuan-Yu could kill Daoist Di-Que, the price would be great.</p><p>The Celestial Fiend Blade Talisman was certainly completely destroyed, even more serious was the damage to himself. By burning the power of his golden core, in the future, not only would it be hopeless for him to form an Infant, even recovering to his original state would not be an easy matter.</p><p>"Come on!"</p><p>Daoist Di-Que roared. He seemed to have been prepared for this all along, and the moment the Celestial Fiend Blade Talisman appeared, he raised a hand to recall the Heavenly Sound Conch.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Daoist Di-Que's face darkened, and he did not hesitate to sacrifice the Heavenly Sound Conch in his hand. With a swing, the Heavenly Sound Conch smashed hard into the Celestial Fiend Blade Talisman.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>After the loud noise, the Celestial Melodious Conch quickly retreated. New cracks appeared on its surface, and the Celestial Gang Sabre Token’s light dimmed for a moment before it flared up again. After a short pause, it shot forward, three points faster than before.</p><p>It was no longer as simple as just burning his Golden Core power, he was overdrawing his reserves. There was no way out!</p><p>His Golden Core power would soon run out, and he would die all the same.</p><p>Immortal Xuan Yu seemed to have lost his mind, and chose to merge with the Celestial Gang Sabre Token. He homed in on the Earth Rift Immortal. Qin Sang could also sense Xuan Yu’s strong intent to die. At this moment, he was no longer seeking to live but simply to take his enemy down with him!</p><p>The Celestial Melodious Conch had no time to come to the rescue. The Earth Rift Immortal’s figure flickered like a bolt of lightning. He repeatedly dodged, but could not escape the Celestial Gang Sabre Token. Seeing that the token was closing in on him, the Earth Rift Immortal found himself forced against the totem barrier.</p><p>But he did not panic at all. He simply kept a cold gaze on the token, and the corners of his mouth curled into a mocking grin. His spiritual energy suddenly exploded.</p><p>The spiritual energy was like a waterfall, setting off a monstrous tidal wave that engulfed both parties.</p><p>“Puppet Transform!”</p><p>In the spiritual energy, the Earth Rift Immortal's eyes flashed with a fierce light and he suddenly made a surprising move.</p><p>He chopped off his left arm with a palm strike!</p><p>At the moment when his left arm detached from his body, it began to squirm and twist in a strange way. It unexpectedly transformed into another Earth Rift Immortal, who stood in front of him. In the next moment, it was pierced by the Celestial Gang Sabre Token!</p><p>But the Earth Rift Immortal’s own aura completely disappeared, and in a flash, he transformed into a firebird, which quietly flew among the group of firebirds and mixed in with them.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The Celestial Gang Sabre Token smashed through the spiritual energy, and with it flew two broken arms, which were immediately pulverized by the sabre Qi.</p><p>The Earth Rift Immortal had vanished!</p><p>All this had happened so quickly that within a split second, the situation had reversed several times.</p><p>The spiritual energy acted as a barrier, so Qin Sang did not witness the Earth Rift Immortal’s Puppet Transformation move with his own eyes. However, seeing the firebirds fleeing while the Celestial Gang Sabre Token had only slain a severed arm, he could guess what had happened.</p><p>The Earth Rift Immortal did not know what kind of secret technique he had used, but he shifted the token’s lock-on aura onto his severed arm and let it die in his stead. He then transformed into a firebird and hid away.</p><p>He only needed to wait for the moment when Immortal Xuan Yu’s Golden Core power was exhausted, and then he could easily gather the fruits of victory.</p><p>A violent tremor ran through the Celestial Gang Sabre Token, accompanied by a piercing roar.</p><p>Immortal Xuan Yu was unwilling, but he was helpless.</p><p>There were countless firebirds, all of which were exactly the same. He simply could not tell which of them was the Earth Rift Immortal.</p><p>Nearby, Qin Sang’s gaze was firmly locked onto one of the firebirds. After watching for so long, he suddenly moved!</p>
