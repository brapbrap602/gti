<h1>Chapter 1112: Heavenly Spiritual Root</h1><p>The leaders of the three great merchant alliances arrived together.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators remained silent, curiously watching the powerful figures at the front, hoping for a good show.  Disappointingly, they only exchanged greetings before falling silent.</p><p>The weathered gate of the Seven Killing Palace seemed to hold a certain magic, captivating the gazes of all the Nascent Soul ancestors.  They stared, speechless.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly observed the leaders of the three great merchant alliances.  Having joined the East Pole Alliance for so long, he was finally meeting their leader in person, the refined scholar.</p><p>The leaders of the three great merchant alliances were shrouded in mystery, rarely appearing in public, and rumors about them abounded.</p><p>Even their cultivation levels were uncertain.</p><p>Some said their cultivation was no weaker than the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi, also Grand Cultivators. Otherwise, neither the righteous nor demonic factions would tolerate the existence of the merchant alliances.  Others whispered that their power was lesser, necessitating their alliance.</p><p>Even in close proximity, the leaders revealed nothing of their aura, making it difficult for Qin Sang to determine their true realms.</p><p>The Demon Lord’s earlier words gave Qin Sang a clue. The leaders of the three great merchant alliances were like cultivators burdened by a priceless treasure, afraid to leave their caves.  Their cultivation was likely slightly inferior to the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>Of course, this was merely Qin Sang’s speculation.</p><p>A faint worry gnawed at him.  He hadn’t expected all the human factions' overlords to gather here. The situation within the Seven Killing Palace was exceptionally complex, and he could only hope it wouldn't affect him.</p><p>Shortly after the arrival of the alliance leaders, several more groups of cultivators appeared, all members of the alliances.</p><p>To Qin Sang’s surprise, a familiar face was among them.</p><p>Su Nu!</p><p>Decades ago, during the chaos in the Demon Sea, Qin Sang had ventured into its depths with Immortal Yue to rescue a woman in exchange for Mountain Fur Vine and safe passage back to the Inner Sea. That woman was Su Nu.</p><p>Since then, Qin Sang hadn't visited Immortal Yue and naturally hadn't seen Su Nu again.  He hadn't expected to encounter her here.</p><p>Su Nu, accompanied by several Foundation Establishment cultivators, followed behind the Nascent Soul ancestor of the East Pole Alliance, her gaze fixed ahead as she walked onto the plaza and stood behind the alliance leader.</p><p>Immortal Yue was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"She's following the alliance leader into the Seven Killing Palace. She holds such a high position in the East Pole Alliance!  Could she not be Immortal Yue’s disciple?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  He'd had his suspicions about the relationship between Immortal Yue and Su Nu, and now it seemed they were indeed more complex than he thought.</p><p>"Wait… her cultivation…"</p><p>Qin Sang gasped, a look of astonishment flashing across his eyes.</p><p>Su Nu’s cultivation had reached the late Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p>When they rescued her, she was only at the Foundation Establishment stage. In just a few decades, she had crossed multiple realms, including the challenging Core Formation bottleneck, to reach late Foundation Establishment, a level comparable to his own.  This was utterly shocking to Qin Sang.</p><p>He had been at mid-Foundation Establishment back then.</p><p>Compared to her, Qin Sang felt his own cultivation progress over the years was pathetic.</p><p>Perhaps only someone with a Heavenly Spiritual Root, unrestricted by the Core Formation bottleneck, could achieve such astonishing cultivation speed.</p><p>"I've missed out on a true cultivation genius."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>No wonder she had caught the eye of the East Pole Alliance leader, and Immortal Yue had spared no effort to rescue her.</p><p>Apart from some rare spiritual herbs and ancient cultivation techniques, the resources the East Pole Alliance could provide were far superior to those of Shaohua Mountain. Su Nu's rapid breakthrough was understandable.</p><p>Chen Yan, Su Nu.</p><p>He had now met two cultivation geniuses with Heavenly Spiritual Roots. They truly lived up to their reputations.  He only wondered if Su Nu, like Chen Yan, would be trapped at the Nascent Soul bottleneck.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Su Nu standing among the others, closely following the Nascent Soul ancestor, a clear indication of her status.</p><p>Su Nu stood there with her head lowered, silent.</p><p>She seemed to sense something and glanced back, a flicker of confusion in her eyes, before turning her gaze back towards the entrance of the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>"Junior Sister, what's wrong?"</p><p>The handsome young man beside her leaned in and asked with concern.</p><p>Su Nu frowned slightly and shook her head.  "Nothing. Why hasn't the Seven Killing Palace opened yet? I heard it's different this time, only a hundred years have passed. Could there be a problem with the Trial Realm that the alliance leader mentioned?"</p><p>"As long as the Seven Killing Palace opens, we can definitely enter the Trial Realm. Don't worry, Junior Sister, I will do my best to obtain a bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid for you. Besides, the alliance leader favors you so much, even if there isn't any Soul Cleansing Liquid in the Trial Realm, he will definitely find a similar spiritual herb for you. With your talent, you don't need to worry about reaching Nascent Soul."</p><p>The young man puffed out his chest, speaking with certainty.</p><p>"I don't deserve such kindness from Senior Brother and the alliance leader. I wish Senior Brother success in obtaining the Soul Cleansing Liquid and reaching Nascent Soul soon."</p><p>Su Nu composed herself and replied obediently.</p><p>Unnoticed, a shadow of gloom flickered in the depths of her beautiful eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd waited before the Seven Killing Palace for a full hour, and the influx of cultivators gradually dwindled.</p><p>Suddenly, the ancient plaque of the Seven Killing Palace shone brightly.</p><p>The sight invigorated the cultivators.</p><p>The light on the plaque intensified, becoming too dazzling to look at directly.</p><p>The Seven Killing Palace itself, and even the entire white jade plaza, began to tremble slightly.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The gate of the Seven Killing Palace suddenly opened on its own.</p><p>Simultaneously, the light on the plaque converged into a beam that shot down to the ground, dividing the entrance into two.  The Seven Killing Palace then fell silent, the movement ceasing.</p><p>A ripple of excitement passed through the crowd, but no one dared to move, all looking towards the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi turned to the Demon Lord.</p><p>The Demon Lord waved a dismissive hand. "You go.  I can't be bothered with such trivial matters."</p><p>Ling Zhuzi took no offense, stepping onto the stairs and approaching the gate of the Seven Killing Palace.  He reached out and touched the beam of light, as if feeling the plaque from afar.</p><p>After a moment, Ling Zhuzi nodded slightly, withdrawing his hand.  Turning to the assembled cultivators, he smiled faintly. "The entrance to the Trial Realm is open. You may enter. It seems the inner hall is normal, unaffected by its early emergence.  Rest assured, fellow Daoists."</p><p>The crowd rejoiced.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>At the edge of a mystical barrier, quite far from the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>Several cultivators were hidden in a mountain hollow, their auras completely concealed.</p><p>One of them was none other than the Nine Phoenix King!</p><p>“Dragon King, you’ve lured us here. You can speak plainly now. How much longer must we wait to enter the inner hall? Are you certain we can infiltrate the human sanctuary undetected? Don’t forget, you're trapped in the Inner Sea like us now. If we’re exposed, there’s nowhere to escape. We’ll be at the mercy of those cultivators.”</p><p>A burly man grumbled.</p><p>His eyes held a hint of impatience and underlying worry.</p><p>Strangely, he had a large black turtle shell on his back.</p><p>The man he questioned, a dignified middle-aged man known as the Dragon King, turned to the Nine Phoenix King.</p>
