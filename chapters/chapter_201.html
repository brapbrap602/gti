<h1>Chapter 194: The Ancient Teleportation Array</h1><p>The orchid had blossomed even more beautifully than before, and was joyously swaying in the Jade Pool, welcoming Qin Sang's arrival.</p><p>In just two short months, the spring water in the pool was almost overflowing.</p><p>The biggest change was the tree root. Countless tendrils had extended from the tree root, embracing the Spirit Spring and piercing deeply into the Jade Pool, merging with it and making it seem as if the root had come to life.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it could be seen that these were not the root's tendrils, but rather strange tendrils that had been created by the fusion of the Jade Pool and the tree root. The two seemed to be merging.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang the most was the Spirit Spring. Originally, only a phantom of a spring eye could be faintly seen, but now a雏形 could be seen!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information about Spirit Springs that he had found earlier. According to this trend, once the Jade Pool and the tree root had truly merged and transformed into a Spirit Spring, the Spirit Spring would be fully formed in less than a year. He might be able to catch the opening of the ancient teleportation array at the Shangyuan Pure Palace and teleport directly to the ancient immortal battlefield.</p><p>Mount Shaohua to the ancient immortal battlefield, one was in the extreme cold domain and the other in the extreme north. In between, they were not only separated by the bustling secular world but also a vast expanse of uninhabited extreme northern ice sheet, a distance of hundreds of thousands of miles. Even a Foundation Building cultivator would take a long time to fly non-stop.</p><p>If the ancient teleportation array were used, it could be reached in an instant.</p><p>However, in the current cultivation world, ancient teleportation arrays were extremely rare. He did not know what the situation was like elsewhere, but in the extreme cold domain, there were only a handful of ancient teleportation arrays on the surface. Only the Shangyuan Pure Palace had one that could reach the edge of the ancient immortal battlefield. Mount Shaohua did not have one. If he did not want to fly over himself, he could only borrow the Shangyuan Pure Palace's.</p><p>This was because the construction method of the ancient teleportation array, like many ancient orthodoxies, had long been lost. In addition, many of the spiritual materials needed to build the ancient teleportation array had disappeared from the cultivation world.</p><p>Even the Yuanshang Sect, which was most proficient in阵法, could not replicate the ancient teleportation array. Their best result was to repair an ancient teleportation array that had not been badly damaged.</p><p>When teleporting through a teleportation array, cultivators had to withstand the pressure of space during teleportation. If the distance was short, it would be fine. However, if the distance was too long, and the cultivator's cultivation was not strong enough, the pressure of space would instantly squeeze the cultivator into dust. This was also the special feature of the ancient teleportation array. It could help cultivators resist the powerful pressure of space, ensuring the safety of teleportation.</p><p>No one could solve this problem. The major sects of the extreme cold domain had not experimented with it. Once the teleportation array was set up too far away, the dead soldiers who entered it would definitely die.</p><p>The teleportation arrays that the current cultivation world could build could only teleport a distance of a hundred miles at most. The cost of building a teleportation array was extremely high, and it also consumed spiritual stones during teleportation.</p><p>This distance was nothing to cultivators and was not worth wasting spiritual stones on. In the major sects, apart from special purposes, they generally did not waste resources to build too many teleportation arrays.</p><p>Because ancient teleportation arrays were rare and could not be repaired once damaged, the cultivation sects were very cautious about using ancient teleportation arrays. The teleportation array in the Shangyuan Pure Palace was opened once every ten years, and it was one-way, with no return.</p><p>Scattered cultivators and cultivators from other small sects had to pay a large amount of spiritual stones to use the ancient teleportation array. Mount Shaohua and the Shangyuan Pure Palace jointly guarded the Suspended Head Pass and had the duty to watch over and help each other. The disciples of their sects could use it for free.</p><p>Qin Sang had inquired with Transmission Talisman to Uncle-Master Wen. There was less than a year until the next time the teleportation array was opened. If the Spirit Spring was formed quickly, he could still make it in time.</p><p>Of course, whether he made it in time or not, Qin Sang was determined to go to the ancient immortal battlefield.</p><p>Seeing that the method in the Secret Dragon Commentary had worked, Qin Sang was overjoyed. At the same time, he had to re-plan his itinerary. There was less than a year left. The most important thing now was to find an extremely hidden spirit vein. After the Spirit Spring was formed, he could transplant it over. Only then could he be at ease fighting on the ancient immortal battlefield.</p><p>There were many cultivators on the edge of the Cloud Cang Great Swamp. It was best to place the Spirit Spring in the depths of the swamp.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang dismissed the thought of going into closed-door cultivation. He closed up his cave abode again and flew towards Mount Shaohua on his sword.</p><p>He was not going to bring the Nine Illusion Heaven Orchid and the Spirit Spring into the ancient immortal battlefield for the time being.</p><p>Firstly, he was not familiar with the ancient immortal battlefield. The ancient immortal battlefield was chaotic, and it was difficult to find a safe place.</p><p>Secondly, his cultivation had not reached the point where he had to cultivate in the Spirit Spring cave abode. The ancient immortal battlefield was rich in spiritual energy, and the sect would also arrange a suitable place for cultivation. This was the benefit of being affiliated with a cultivation sect.</p><p>...</p><p>After meeting with Sect Master Yu on the Headmaster Peak and reporting his intention to go to the ancient immortal battlefield and take the ancient teleportation array, he received a batch of affairs from the depths of the Cloud Cang Great Swamp. Qin Sang left the sect without stopping and headed straight for the depths of the Cloud Cang Great Swamp.</p><p>Time flew by and half a year passed in a blink of an eye.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had been extremely busy running about Dazed, making friends with fellow Daoists, dealing with trivial matters for the sect, hunting down ferocious beasts with other fellow Daoists, and even exploring the ruins of an ancient cultivator. Unfortunately, the ruins were not very well hidden and had already been ransacked by others.</p><p>The energy he had expended was not proportional to his收获.</p><p>However, Qin Sang managed to find a well-concealed spiritual vein and he no longer felt like his efforts had been wasted.</p><p>The spiritual vein was not small, but it was very well-hidden. It was nestled in a secluded part of the vast, watery marshes, and there were no valuable spiritual herbs or materials in the vicinity. As long as he sealed it with the Profound Obscurity Turtle Shell Formation, it would definitely be safe and secure.</p><p>Half a year later, Qin Sang returned to the sect, travel-worn and weary. He collected his reward and then went to Wenyue Market to hand over all the spiritual materials he had obtained during his trip to Shopkeeper Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang had only managed to find one beast at the Monstrous Spirit Realm. Moreover, he had hunted it down with several other cultivators, so the carcass he received was very limited. He could not refine it into a Soul-Devouring Cone. Therefore, he had selected a few small magic weapons that had a special function and asked Shopkeeper Wu to help him refine them.</p><p>He returned to his cave dwelling with feelings of anticipation and trepidation. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><p>The form of the spiritual spring in the jade pool had changed dramatically. The roots of the tree and a piece of jade had completely intertwined to form a strange shape. There was a small pit at the intersection of the two, and the spring of the spiritual spring depended on it.</p><p>The gurgling water flowed out from the spring and then transformed into potent spiritual energy that stimulated the mind. The Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid in the jade pool also appeared to be thriving more vigorously.</p><p>It seemed that the spiritual spring would be fully formed within a month!</p><p>A month later, Qin Sang woke up from his meditative trance. The fatigue from his body was swept away and he looked at the spiritual spring that had been fully formed in front of him with bright eyes. He smiled slightly, took out a jade box, carefully dug up the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid, and then dug out the spiritual spring.</p><p>The roots of the tree and the piece of jade had become one and both had become crystal clear. The spiritual spring’s vortex was constantly gushing out potent spiritual energy.</p><p>This was a wondrous object孕育ed by the heavens and earth, dazzlingly exquisite, enough to intoxicate people.</p><p>He put away the two treasures, and then put away the Profound Obscurity Turtle Shell Formation’s formation flags. Qin Sang gave the cave dwelling, where he had lived for many years, a感慨ed look. After孕育ing the spiritual spring, the spiritual vein already seemed to have completed its mission. With the spiritual spring having been dug out by Qin Sang, it would gradually dry up.</p>
