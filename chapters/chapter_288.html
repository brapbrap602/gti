<h1>Chapter 281: Unity Pendant</h1><p>After seeing off Yu Kong, Qin Sang settled down on a meditation cushion in contemplation.</p><p>In Western Desolate Town, especially among cultivators who had been lurking in the vicinity, almost no one believed in the emergence of the Medicine Garden, or the majority were doubtful. They wouldn't mind searching for it after entering, but it would not be their primary objective.</p><p>After all, there were still treasures in some important places in Autumn Robin Market, and the low tide period of the protective grand formation would exist briefly. After Autumn Robin Market was closed, it would be very dangerous. No one dared to stay inside for 30 years.</p><p>Rather than spending effort searching for the elusive Medicine Garden, it would be better to focus on competing for the visible treasures.</p><p>If it were not for the jade pendant shown by the Wandering Cultivator, Qin Sang would not have been able to help doubting its authenticity.</p><p>The jade pendant's scene was shown to the Wandering Cultivator by Ge Yuan, and Ge Yuan's identity was somewhat special.</p><p>The person who discovered the Medicine Garden was named Shao Chunhui. Ge Yuan was considered as Shao Chunhui's friend. They had worked together several times. They were all people who knew what to give up and what to pursue. The process was quite harmonious without any conflicts, which built up a bit of a trust basis among them.</p><p>――――――</p><p>Yu Kong and his fellow members did not know about the existence of Ge Yuan.</p><p>Before Shao Chunhui's accident, he had once sought out Ge Yuan and showed him this scene, inviting him to search for the spirit medicine together. However, out of prudence, Shao Chunhui had only revealed the tip of the iceberg and did not elaborate further.</p><p>Based on the trust built up through several partnerships, Ge Yuan agreed immediately. However, unexpectedly, Shao Chunhui was never heard of again thereafter.</p><p>However, Ge Yuan was not the first person to spread the rumor.</p><p>Ge Yuan had long forgotten this matter. However, two years ago, when rumors about the Medicine Garden in Autumn Robin Market suddenly spread, it came back to his mind.</p><p>After secretly investigating, Ge Yuan suspected that the murderer who killed Shao Chunhui must be one of his companions who entered Autumn Robin Market with him.</p><p>He eventually narrowed it down to Yu Kong and his two fellow members.</p><p>Only these three men had attempted to return to Autumn Robin Market and were openly recruiting men.</p><p>Speaking of avenging Shao Chunhui, Ge Yuan did not have the capability nor the intention. His friendship with Shao Chunhui was not enough to make him sacrifice his life.</p><p>Ge Yuan knew that Yu Kong and his two fellow members were all very powerful. No matter which of the three was the murderer, he was no match.</p><p>But, Ge Yuan was very interested in the spirit medicine.</p><p>The scene shown to him by Shao Chunhui was very tempting. Whether it was the Medicine Garden of an ancient cultivator or the spirit medicine planted by the previous owner of Autumn Robin Market, there was no doubt that it was extremely precious. Even if he only obtained one or two, it would be of great benefit to his cultivation.</p><p>Because Ge Yuan was weak and could not ascertain who the murderer was, he decided to stir up the situation and add fuel to the fire, capitalizing on the momentum of the spreading rumors to push the waves.</p><p>Rather than letting others quietly pick the spirit medicine, it would be better to create a big fuss. Perhaps he might get a chance to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ge Yuan's actions were imprudent. As soon as he started his moves, he almost exposed his tracks. Fortunately, at that critical moment, the Wandering Cultivator happened to come by and saved Ge Yuan's life.</p><p>After understanding the cause and effect, the Wandering Cultivator stopped Ge Yuan's crude plan. After all, the number of masters entering Autumn Robin Market was too numerous. If the Medicine Garden was exposed, those spirit medicines would certainly not be enough to share.</p><p>In the end, they decided to infiltrate the three men's subordinates separately and figure out the location of the secret passage. As long as they could get themselves inside, they would definitely get a piece of the pie.</p><p>Ge Yuan stayed in Western Desolate Town to observe the situation while the Wandering Cultivator returned to Suspended Cranium Pass and invited Qin Sang.</p><p>……</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang went out early in the morning again and ran into Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong had yet to gather enough men to practice the formation. Qin Sang had been going out almost every day recently to inquire in Western Desolate Town. Sometimes, he sat blankly in a teahouse for a whole day. Sometimes, he frequented various shops, using spirit stones to buy information.</p><p>Yu Kong had grown accustomed to it and did not urge Qin Sang to respond to his invitation.</p><p>"Daoist Fellow has been rushing around all day, long. I wonder if you have found out any news?" Yu Kong asked with pretended curiosity. However, there was a hint of a confident smile on the corner of his mouth, clearly certain that Qin Sang could not have achieved anything.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a dry laugh and cupped his hands. "It's okay, it's okay..."</p><p>Watching Qin Sang leave, Yu Kong shook his head with a slight laugh.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to do almost the same as before. When he passed by an alleyway, his gaze suddenly fixed on it. He walked into the alley calmly, entered a shop casually after passing a shop, and disappeared inside.</p><p>The person in the shop was the Wandering Cultivator.</p><p>"Senior, why did you request an urgent meeting at this time? Aren't you afraid of exposing your tracks?" Qin Sang asked with a frown and a dissatisfied tone.</p><p>He had been very careful and cautious in everything he did to gain Yu Kong's trust. Meeting at this time was extremely risky.</p><p>"Junior Qin, don’t worry, I kept following you along the way. No one is watching us." Yun Youzi led Qin Sang to the back hall and whispered, "Junior Qin hasn’t met Fellow Daoist Ge yet. Sheng Yuanzi has gathered everyone, and Fellow Daoist Ge is about to leave the Western Wasteland Town. If we delay further, we may not make it in time. I’ll give you the Same-Mind Pendant first."</p><p>Apart from Yu Kong, the other two people were Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, both of whom were mid-level Foundation Establishment experts just like Yu Kong.</p><p>Ge Yuan had been recruited by Sheng Yuanzi, and it seemed that Yun Youzi had managed to join Luo Xingnan’s team.</p><p>In the back hall, Qin Sang saw Ge Yuan for the first time.</p><p>This person had a similar appearance to Qin Sang and was quite handsome. His brows carried a trace of arrogance, and Qin Sang observed sharply that when Ge Yuan looked at him, there was a hint of contempt in his eyes.</p><p>In the world of immortal cultivation, only strength mattered.</p><p>Ge Yuan’s cultivation was even higher than Yun Youzi, similar to Yu Daiyue, and he was not far from breaking through the mid-level Foundation Establishment. If Yun Youzi had not saved his life, he might not have submitted to Yun Youzi.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed. "Fellow Daoist Ge, I greet you."</p><p>"Greetings."</p><p>Ge Yuan nodded casually and eyed Qin Sang up. He warned unceremoniously, "To me, Fellow Daoist’s cultivation is still too shallow. However, Senior Yun Youzi has spoken highly of you, so I guess you won’t let him down?"</p><p>As long as he could achieve his goal, Qin Sang didn’t mind Ge Yuan’s contempt and replied with a normal expression, "Don’t worry, Fellow Daoist Ge, I’ll definitely follow Senior’s instructions. If I discover anything, I will inform you two immediately. I will never act on my own."</p><p>Ge Yuan only then looked away from Qin Sang and turned to Yun Youzi, "Senior, time’s running out. Let’s distribute the Same-Mind Pendant first."</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded and took out three identical ivory pendants.</p><p>"These three Same-Mind Pendants were refined from the ivory of the same Sky Net White Elephant. I managed to get them after a lot of searching.</p><p>It’s said that the Sky Net White Elephant has the bloodline of the divine beast Ti Ting, so the Same-Mind Pendant also has the ability to communicate and transmit messages. Although we can’t communicate over long distances, it’s enough for the Qiuhong Market.</p><p>The three of us will simultaneously drip our blood onto the Same-Mind Pendant. If we discover anything, crush the pendant immediately. Then, the other two will be informed.</p><p>The Same-Mind Pendant comes with its unique magic power, and there won’t be any spiritual fluctuation, so it’s impossible for others to discover it.</p><p>However, you two must remember, once the Same-Mind Pendant is crushed, it can’t be restored. There’s only one chance, so make sure the information is true. Otherwise, we’d all be wasting our time."</p><p>Chapter 281: Matching Pendants</p><p>After seeing Yu Kong off, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a cushion, lost in thought.</p><p>In Westwaste Town, especially among the cultivators active in the vicinity, almost no one believed in the existence of the herb garden. Or rather, most were skeptical; they wouldn't mind searching for it if they entered the ruins, but they wouldn't consider it their primary objective.</p><p>After all, some vital areas within the Autumn Firmament Market still held treasures, and the window of vulnerability in the protective formation was extremely short.  Once the market sealed itself, dangers abounded, and no one dared to stay inside for thirty years.</p><p>Rather than wasting energy searching for an illusory herb garden, it was better to focus on competing for visible treasures.</p><p>If it weren't for the image displayed by the jade pendant that Wanderer presented, Qin Sang would have also doubted the truth of this matter.</p><p>The image on the jade pendant was shown to Wanderer by Ge Yuan, and Ge Yuan's identity was somewhat special.</p><p>The person who discovered the herb garden was named Shao Chunhui. Ge Yuan could be considered Shao Chunhui's friend. They had collaborated a few times, both being pragmatic individuals. Their interactions were generally harmonious, with no friction arising, fostering a foundation of trust between them.</p><p>――――――</p><p>Yu Kong and the others were unaware of Ge Yuan's existence.</p><p>Before Shao Chunhui's demise, he sought out Ge Yuan and revealed the image of the garden to him, inviting him to join in the search for spirit herbs. However, out of caution, Shao Chunhui only revealed the tip of the iceberg and didn't offer much explanation.</p><p>Based on the trust established through their previous collaborations, Ge Yuan readily agreed.  Unexpectedly, Shao Chunhui disappeared without a trace afterward.</p><p>However, Ge Yuan wasn't the one who initially spread the rumors.</p><p>Ge Yuan had long since forgotten about this matter until two years ago when rumors about the Autumn Firmament Market’s herb garden suddenly surfaced, jogging his memory.</p><p>After conducting a discreet investigation, Ge Yuan suspected that Shao Chunhui's killer was likely one of his companions who entered the market together, ultimately narrowing his suspicions down to Yu Kong and his two associates.</p><p>Only these three attempted to re-enter the market and were actively recruiting others.</p><p>Ge Yuan had neither the ability nor the intention to avenge Shao Chunhui.  Their friendship wasn't deep enough to warrant such a sacrifice.</p><p>Ge Yuan knew that Yu Kong and the other two were all exceptionally powerful. Regardless of which one was the killer, he was no match for them.</p><p>But Ge Yuan was deeply interested in spirit herbs.</p><p>The image Shao Chunhui showed him was too alluring. Whether it was an ancient cultivator's herb garden or the spirit herbs planted by the former owner of the market, they were undoubtedly invaluable. Even obtaining one or two would greatly benefit his cultivation.</p><p>As Ge Yuan was alone and unable to pinpoint the killer, he decided to stir up the situation, adding fuel to the fire by leveraging the spread of rumors.</p><p>Rather than having someone quietly harvest all the herbs, creating chaos might offer an opportunity to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ge Yuan acted carelessly.  His initial actions nearly exposed him. Luckily, at a critical moment, Wanderer happened upon him and saved his life.</p><p>After learning the whole story, Wanderer halted Ge Yuan's crude plan. After all, countless experts were entering the Autumn Firmament Market. If the herb garden were exposed, the spirit herbs wouldn't be enough for everyone.</p><p>Finally, they decided to infiltrate the ranks of the three suspects separately to uncover the location of the secret passage. As long as they could get inside, they were sure to get a share.</p><p>Ge Yuan remained in Westwaste Town to observe the situation, while Wanderer returned to Skull Gorge to bring in Qin Sang.</p><p>……</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang went out again early in the morning and encountered Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong hadn't yet assembled enough people to practice the formation.  Over the past few days, Qin Sang had gone out almost every day, making inquiries in Westwaste Town. Sometimes, he would sit idly in teahouses all day, other times he would shuttle between various shops, using spirit stones to purchase information.</p><p>Yu Kong had become accustomed to this and didn't press Qin Sang for a response to his invitation.</p><p>"Daoist Priest, you're always coming and going in a hurry.  Have you discovered anything?" Yu Kong inquired with feigned curiosity, a confident smile playing on his lips, clearly convinced that Qin Sang's efforts were futile.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a dry laugh and cupped his hands. "Just so-so…"</p><p>Watching Qin Sang leave, Yu Kong chuckled and shook his head dismissively.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his usual routine. Upon passing a dark alleyway, his gaze suddenly sharpened. He inconspicuously entered the alley and slipped into a shop.</p><p>The person inside the shop was Wanderer.</p><p>"Senior, isn't this hasty meeting risky?  Could it expose us?" Qin Sang frowned, his tone laced with不满.</p><p>He had been extremely cautious to gain Yu Kong's trust, and this meeting posed a significant risk.</p><p>Friend Qin, rest assured, I've been right behind you, no one's following," Wanderer led Qin Sang into the back room, whispering, "You haven't met Ge yet... Shengyuanzi has assembled everyone, and Ge is about to leave West Wasteland Town.  Any later and we might miss our chance. I need to give you the Harmony Pendants first."</p><p>Besides Yu Kong, the other two were named Luo Xingnan and Shengyuanzi. Like Yu Kong, both were at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Ge Yuan had been recruited by Shengyuanzi, and Wanderer seemed to have successfully infiltrated Luo Xingnan's team.</p><p>In the back room, Qin Sang met Ge Yuan for the first time.</p><p>He looked about Qin Sang's age, handsome and dignified, with a hint of arrogance between his brows.  Qin Sang keenly noticed a flicker of disdain in Ge Yuan's eyes as he looked him over.</p><p>In the cultivation world, strength reigns supreme.</p><p>Ge Yuan's cultivation was even higher than Wanderer's, comparable to Yu Daiyue, and not far from breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment. If Wanderer hadn't saved his life, he might not even respect him.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly. "Greetings, Fellow Cultivator Ge."</p><p>"No need for formalities, Daoist."</p><p>Ge Yuan nodded casually, scrutinizing Qin Sang, and warned bluntly, "Your cultivation level seems rather low. However, Senior Wanderer speaks very highly of you.  Surely you won't disappoint him?"</p><p>As long as the plan succeeded, Qin Sang didn't mind being looked down upon. He replied calmly, "Rest assured, Fellow Cultivator Ge. I will follow Senior Wanderer's instructions.  If I discover anything, I'll immediately inform you two. I won't act rashly."</p><p>Ge Yuan finally turned his attention away from Qin Sang and looked at Wanderer. "Senior, time is of the essence. Let's distribute the Harmony Pendants."</p><p>Wanderer nodded and took out three identical ivory round pendants.</p><p>"These three Harmony Pendants were refined from the tusk of a single Celestial Net White Elephant.  It took me a great deal of effort to acquire them.</p><p>Legend says the Celestial Net White Elephant carries the bloodline of the divine beast, Titi. These pendants have the ability to transmit messages. Though their range isn't vast, it's sufficient within Autumn Goose Marketplace.</p><p>The three of us will drip our blood onto the pendants. If anything is discovered, immediately crush your pendant, and the others will be notified.</p><p>The pendants possess a unique property, emitting no spiritual energy fluctuations. They're undetectable.</p><p>However, be warned, once crushed, they cannot be restored. There's only one chance, so make sure the information is accurate, or we'll have wasted our efforts."</p>
