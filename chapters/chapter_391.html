<h1>Chapter 384: Yaksha</h1><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi held their breath, waiting in place for a moment. After confirming that the group of Feijiao Yulong hadn't discovered them, they began to dive into the depths of the ice cave.</p><p>Yun Youzi had mentioned that the strange being was just ahead, and Qin Sang couldn't help but feel both nervous and expectant.</p><p>His primary purpose in accompanying Yun Youzi was naturally to fulfill his promise and assist him in obtaining the spirit medicine.</p><p>Secondly, if the strange being truly was a self-acting jiangshi, its master, unless they had met with some unforeseen circumstance, wouldn't leave such a powerful jiangshi unattended.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the master might have died here, which would explain why the jiangshi roamed freely in the vicinity.</p><p>In such a cold and remote place, rarely visited by humans, and guarded by a jiangshi, the corpse of the jiangshi's master might still be here!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered as he walked, contemplating how to find the corpse and retrieve its belongings under the jiangshi's watchful gaze.</p><p>The treasures among the belongings were secondary; what Qin Sang truly desired was the second half of the *Tianyin Shijue*, especially the secret technique for enhancing a jiangshi into a flying Yaksha.</p><p>The ice cave was full of diverging paths. Yun Youzi, having been here before, was familiar with the route. After a dizzying series of twists and turns, Yun Youzi whispered, "Brother Qin, it's just ahead..."</p><p>At the end of the straight passage was a massive ice hall.</p><p>A dim blue light emanated from within the ice hall, just enough to make out its overall structure.</p><p>The ice hall wasn't rectangular, not appearing to be artificially constructed. It was empty and spacious, with several doors on either side leading to other areas, which could be considered side chambers.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the ice hall. From a distance, nothing seemed amiss. It was utterly silent, and the strange being was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The faint blue light emanated from the ice itself.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's gaze shifted, fixating on a side chamber to the right of the ice hall. He asked, "Is the strange being inside that side chamber?"</p><p>"Precisely!"</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded, pointing to the other side, "The chamber I need to enter is on that side. Once I make a move, it's bound to alert the strange being. This individual possesses incredible遁术, moving like a phantom, and their strength is formidable. Brother Qin, I need you to buy me at least fifteen breaths' worth of time."</p><p>Fifteen breaths.</p><p>Qin Sang paused for a moment, then said in a deep voice, "We'll only know after trying."</p><p>Fifteen breaths, for a cultivator, could be the difference between life and death. He had come prepared, and if the opponent truly was a jiangshi, he might have a chance.</p><p>However, without seeing the strange being's true form, Qin Sang couldn't be certain.</p><p>Yun Youzi summoned his Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat. "This old Daoist has probed before. For some unknown reason, the strange being doesn't stray far from the main hall. After pursuing for a certain distance, it returns on its own. However, against this being's诡异遁术, that distance feels like an insurmountable chasm.  The people who entered with this old Daoist years ago perished at its hands. Once inside the ice hall, after the strange being appears, Brother Qin, probe briefly, then immediately board the flying boat..."</p><p>Yun Youzi reiterated his instructions meticulously, establishing a detailed plan with Qin Sang. It was clear how much he dreaded the strange being.</p><p>Qin Sang committed everything to memory. Seeing Yun Youzi's caution, he dared not slacken in the slightest. He immediately summoned his Ebony Sword and prepared to activate his Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman at any moment.</p><p>If things went south, even if it meant exposing the talisman, escape was paramount.</p><p>Both prepared, they exchanged a glance, then abandoned their stealth, rising on their swords and charging directly into the ice hall. In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi appeared in the center of the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze darted around, memorizing the layout of the ice hall. He heightened his spiritual sense to its peak, sweeping his divine consciousness across every corner, his heart pounding with tension.</p><p>Yet, after their arrival, the ice hall remained unchanged, without a single anomaly.</p><p>Suddenly, Yun Youzi's expression shifted, and he roared,</p><p>"Behind!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart lurched. Without turning his head, he thrust his Ebony Sword backward, its light erupting.</p><p>Simultaneously, Yun Youzi twisted his upper body into a grotesque shape, gripping his blue light sword tightly and unleashing a surge of sword Qi several meters long, cleaving downwards!</p><p>Two bursts of sword Qi erupted simultaneously, their light reflecting off the layers of ice, illuminating the hall in a dazzling display.</p><p>Prepared, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi remained calm, everything proceeding according to plan.</p><p>Their two swords cooperated seamlessly, converging mid-air and slashing fiercely towards a point in the empty space.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A deafening roar echoed.</p><p>The sword Qi shattered.</p><p>Their flying swords recoiled!</p><p>A figure materialized in the void.</p><p>The figure stood with fists clenched, its stance like thunder, meeting their combined sword Qi with an incredibly forceful posture!</p><p>Facing their joint attack, the figure remained unmoved, shattering their sword Qi with a single punch.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, on the other hand, were sent reeling, feeling the impact of a terrifying force. They both grunted in pain, tumbling backward in disarray.</p><p>*Thud! Thud!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi crashed heavily against the ice walls.</p><p>Their combined strength couldn't withstand a single punch from the strange being!</p><p>Qin Sang's blood surged. Ignoring the intense pain, he steadied himself, catching a glimpse of the strange being's appearance in his peripheral vision.</p><p>The figure was thin, resembling a middle-aged scholar. Its clothes were tattered, revealing skin of a strange, bluish-black hue, including its face.</p><p>Its face was expressionless, its pitch-black eyes seeming to hold a disturbing glint that sent a chill down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>Suddenly, the strange being vanished again.</p><p>Yun Youzi's words were no exaggeration. After the being disappeared, Qin Sang couldn't sense it at all.</p><p>"Brother Qin!"</p><p>Yun Youzi had already summoned his Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat and shouted urgently.</p><p>A sense of foreboding washed over Qin Sang. He flickered, hastily boarding the flying boat. Yun Youzi let out a low shout, and the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat erupted in green light, shooting forward.</p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p>Just as the flying boat was about to exit the ice hall, a bluish-black hand emerged from the void, its sharp black nails carrying a nauseating corpse Qi, reaching for them with lightning speed.</p><p>The ghostly hand was about to tear through the flying boat's barrier, disemboweling them both. At this critical moment, Qin Sang, surprisingly, didn't flinch. He stared intently at the ghostly hand, a strange glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>In the next instant, a surprising thing happened. The ghostly hand hesitated for a fraction of a second.</p><p>Taking advantage of this brief pause, the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat blinked, rushing out of the hall and escaping the danger.</p><p>On the flying boat, Yun Youzi looked at Qin Sang with a face full of surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled and nodded at Yun Youzi.</p><p>The encounter had lasted less than a breath, and they had already faced mortal danger. Despite its brevity, Qin Sang had sensed the unique aura emanating from the strange being.</p><p>Yun Youzi's perception was correct. The strange being's true identity was indeed a jiangshi refined using a Heavenly Corpse Talisman!</p><p>Moreover, it wasn't an ordinary jiangshi, but a Flying Yaksha!</p>
