<h1>Chapter 2070:  The Qi of Green Spirit</h1><p>Several cultivators were still worshipping before the statue, unaware of the presence of someone standing beside it, an exact likeness of the statue itself.</p><p>At that moment, two beams of light shot out from the depths of Deer Wilds. Li Yu Fu, having learned from Shen Chen that his master was returning, hurried out to greet him.</p><p>Seeing his master, Li Yu Fu's expression brightened, his heart stirred with excitement. He took two quick steps forward, about to pay his respects, when he sensed something unusual about his master's aura.  He saw Si Lu beside him shake his head.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, he glanced at the surrounding cultivators and revealed himself to them.</p><p>"Huh? This person's appearance... is it Master Li?"</p><p>"That's Lord Shen of the Heavenly Crafts Guild!"</p><p>"Greetings to the Master and Lord Shen!"</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing the two, the cultivators gathered around.  In the eyes of the world, they were legendary figures. The cultivators were thrilled, feeling their journey had been worthwhile.</p><p>"Greetings to all fellow Daoists!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed politely, announcing in a clear voice, "Our sect has urgent business and must temporarily close its gates. We apologize for any inconvenience caused."</p><p>"No worries, no worries…"</p><p>"Master, where would you be saying such things? You flatter us."</p><p>The cultivators returned their greetings, repeatedly assuring him it was fine. For such a matter, a single attendant from Qing Yang Sect would suffice.  For the Sect Master himself to offer a personal explanation, it was an immense honor, leaving no room for resentment.</p><p>Some even concernedly asked, "Has your sect encountered any trouble? Although our cultivation is humble, we are willing to offer our assistance!"</p><p>Others also showed concern. Qing Yang Sect was already a sacred place in the hearts of cultivators; any problem there could potentially affect the entire Storm World.</p><p>Li Yu Fu clasped his hands and said, "Thank you for your concern. There is no difficulty. We will reopen the gates shortly and welcome you all back."</p><p>Hearing this, the cultivators were relieved and bid their farewells. In an instant, only a few people remained before the statue.</p><p>Li Yu Fu then summoned the Sect Master's decree and activated a powerful formation, concealing Deer Wilds. Immediately after, the disciples of Qing Yang Sect within Deer Wilds received a message from the Sect Master, ordering them not to leave.</p><p>After sending off the cultivators, Li Yu Fu and Shen Chen stood respectfully, but soon sensed something amiss from Qin Sang's aura.</p><p>Such profound and unpredictable…</p><p>Li Yu Fu and Shen Chen exchanged a look, realizing a possibility, their hearts filled with awe and reverence.</p><p>Qin Sang remained immersed in a strange state.</p><p>The chaotic fragments of divine intent dissolved in his consciousness.  Instinctively, Qin Sang refined them into a stream of pure divine intent, melting away the barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his understanding of the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture* and the Great Path had deepened, more than enough to break through his bottleneck.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang confirmed something: despite both being on the Great Path, the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture* and the prevalent divine path in the Great Thousand World were vastly different. Unlike divine cultivators who fed on the offerings of faith, his power wasn't derived from it.</p><p>In Moon-Washed Bay, he destroyed the Falling Soul Abyss and chased away the Cloud Heaven, earning the reverence of the world.</p><p>In Storm World, people erected statues in his honor and worshipped him.</p><p>In both places, while he benefited, he didn't directly draw strength from them.  His improvement lay in his own cultivation, his comprehension of the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture*, and his understanding of the Dao.  His previous doubts were answered. This subtly resolved most of his bottlenecks, making cultivation significantly more efficient and breakthroughs easier.</p><p>But to enhance his cultivation, he still needed arduous self-cultivation.</p><p>Divine cultivators, sustained by the offerings of their followers, were conversely constrained. Once they lost all their followers, their foundation could collapse.  If the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture* were the same, it wasn't what Qin Sang desired. He always believed that only oneself was fundamental.</p><p>This difference prevented Qin Sang from making a definitive judgment, yet he couldn't stand idly by as Storm World crumbled to verify it.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that during his Void Refinement stage, the Zi Wei Sword Venerable might still have been searching for the Dao, not truly having chosen the Great Path of Slaughter.</p><p>Comparing the Dao to a perilous peak, cultivating was like grasping a ladder leading to the summit, climbing upward. Perhaps the Zi Wei Sword Venerable found the ladder of the Great Path of Slaughter suited him halfway, tried it for a while, but hadn't yet decided to fully commit.</p><p>If that were the truth, the Zi Wei Sword Venerable's future choice regarding the Great Path of Slaughter remained uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang examined his inner self, ‘seeing’ the sword intent he had obtained in the Taiyin Divine Temple. If so, he didn't need to rush into changing his path.  Waiting until the peak of Void Refinement or even the Unity Transformation stage to fully understand the Dao in the sword intent before making a decision would be more appropriate.</p><p>Thus, his path to transcendence was truly established!</p><p>Next, according to the established plan, he would establish a Daoist temple here, protecting the beings of the Storm World and driving out foreign enemies. The more prosperous the temple, the more beneficial it would be for his comprehension of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, slowly opening his eyes. Seeing Li Yu Fu, he nodded slightly.</p><p>"Unworthy disciple, greets Master Uncle!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed down in worship.</p><p>Qin Sang used spiritual energy to lift Li Yu Fu, looked him over, and said, "Your senior will surely be very pleased to know of your current achievements."</p><p>He had originally expected that Li Yu Fu's breakthrough to the Divine Transformation stage would be a great blessing, a chance for them to see each other again in this lifetime.  He never imagined this disciple would be so outstanding, having already reached the mid-Divine Transformation stage—a testament to the cultivation imparted by Yunyouzi and himself!</p><p>Li Yu Fu's lips moved, his eyes flashing with excitement. As the master of a sect, he had to maintain his dignity at all times; it had been a long time since he had been so unguarded.</p><p>"Come, let's go inside and talk."</p><p>Qin Sang strode inside.</p><p>Li Yu Fu replied, "Yes," and quickly followed, asking, "Master Uncle, should we have the disciples come out to pay their respects?"</p><p>"No need," Qin Sang shook his head. "My return should not be revealed to the outside world for now. You are the master; the internal and external affairs of Qingyang Temple will still be handled by you."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu knew his master uncle must have his reasons and asked no further questions, leading Qin Sang and others into the main hall.</p><p>The main hall of Qingyang Temple was built next to Qin Sang's old cave abode.</p><p>"The two Daoist friends can rest in the main hall first. I have some things to take care of," Qin Sang said.  He was very familiar with Si Lu, so there was no need for pleasantries. He left Shen Chen to entertain them and called Li Yu Fu to go to the cave abode.</p><p>His cave abode was now a restricted area. Except for the Taiji Immortal Stage and the Ice and Fire Order that made up the tribulation-passing array, it was essentially maintained as it was when he left.</p><p>Seeing the old objects before him, Qin Sang looked at them one by one, sighing, "When I hastily left this world, I thought I would never return in this lifetime. It was only when I met Gu Ya that I learned about the ascension of the Storm World…"</p><p>As for the twists and turns of his ascension experience and the matter of the Talisman Realm, he would not tell Li Yu Fu about that for now.</p><p>"Gu Ya?"</p><p>Li Yu Fu recalled her identity, understanding the situation, and joyfully said, "Unexpectedly, the Misty Waterfall was not a death trap. It seems that other Daoists swept away by the Misty Waterfall might also be alive like Daoist Gu Ya. It must be fate that Daoist Gu Ya encountered Master Uncle in the vast expanse of the Great Thousand World!"</p><p>He also hadn't expected to see his Master Uncle again in this life. After the storm dissipated, they had all gone to the Wu Shen Mountain in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>This sacred mountain of the Wu tribe, a spiritual totem for the Wu tribe, was even moved here to the Central Plains.</p><p>On Wu Shen Mountain, traces of Qin Sang's ascension still remained.</p><p>Although the strange energy had dissipated, anyone with discerning eyes could see how powerful it was, especially since it had pierced the world barrier and been eroded by the power of the barrier.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how terrifyingly powerful the owner of this energy was.  At that time, Qin Sang, who had just entered the Divine Transformation stage, was almost impossible to survive.</p><p>Combining the Heavenly Dao demonic sound and the Wu tribe's description of the scene at that time, people made a reasonable deduction: behind the Heavenly Dao demonic sound was a peerless beast intent on swallowing a world, and the barriers of various regions not only blocked the storm but also prevented the beast from spying, but the power of the barriers was constantly waning.</p><p>Previous ascenders had long been devoured by the beast.  Qin Sang left the Central Plains, crossed the storm to the Canglang Sea, and therefore became a target.</p><p>All signs indicated that the lower realm merged into the Great Thousand World because Qin Sang lured the beast away, at the cost of his life. That is why various races and sects were willing to revere him as a saint.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and said, "We were very worried about your situation. Now it seems that both the Storm World and Qingyang Temple are far better than expected."</p><p>"It's also thanks to fortunate circumstances. If the lower realm had directly merged into the Great Thousand World and encountered the Changyou tribe at its peak, we might have been annihilated long ago."</p><p>Li Yu Fu showed a trace of fear, and recounted his past experiences.</p><p>"Later, we learned that our integration into the Great Thousand World was a long process, which also affected the Great Thousand World, causing the foul energy here to surge and rise.</p><p>"During this period, many powerful beasts escaped from within. These beasts were inherently ferocious, slaughtering all living beings they encountered, leading to chaos among the Changyou tribe. To resist the beasts, they paid a huge price and suffered heavy losses, failing to discover us immediately.</p><p>"We suspect that as the lower realm merged, the world barrier gradually melted away, and the world changed drastically. Those beasts wandering in the storm and the abyss instinctively felt uneasy, trying to escape. After the world barrier weakened to a certain extent, they rushed into the Great Thousand World first, saving us from a disaster."</p><p>Even so, our situation back then was extremely perilous.  After the cataclysm, while spiritual energy grew increasingly abundant, terrifying celestial phenomena filled everyone with dread, fearing the world's end, leaving us all helpless.</p><p>At that time, the strongest cultivators with the best chance of breaking through to the next realm, such as Master Xingji from Ganlu Temple and the sect leader of Bunian Mountain, were driven by fear like wild beasts, desperately trying to escape and forcibly ascend.</p><p>They meticulously prepared various treasures to counter the Heavenly Devilish Sounds, yet they encountered grey tribulation thunder during their ascension attempts, resulting in almost total annihilation.  Fairy Liuli was slightly slower, receiving a warning and aided by a tribulation formation left by her master, she managed to successfully ascend.</p><p>Fairy Liuli managed to maneuver around the Changyou tribe, found a way to quickly restore the power of the Ice and Fire Order, and discovered a type of Azure Spirit Qi in the Foul Lands.  This Azure Spirit Qi could help cultivators overcome their bottlenecks. Fairy Liuli didn't hoard it; she summoned various clans and sects to discuss its use.  After that, more cultivators gradually broke through to the next realm.</p><p>Therefore, when the Changyou tribe launched a massive invasion, we had some capacity to resist, although we still lost the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea.</p><p>"I also obtained a strand of Azure Spirit Qi, which led to my current achievements…"</p><p>Li Yu-fu's words expressed deep gratitude towards Liuli.  It wasn't just him; many clans and sects owed Liuli a debt of gratitude.  Combined with Qin Sang's extensive travels throughout the various regions and his connections with various factions, Liuli was able to successfully unite the Storm World under her command.</p><p>Qin Sang could imagine Liuli's tireless efforts, the weight of a world's fate resting on her delicate shoulders.  Yet Liuli didn't have to do this. She didn't cultivate the Dao of Great Ascension; the benefits ultimately went to others.</p><p>Li Yu-fu noticed Qin Sang's expression.  Everyone at Qingyang Temple witnessed Fairy Liuli's sacrifices, and they held immense respect and admiration for their mistress.  However, Li Yu-fu knew their past marriage was a sham, and he was unsure if his master and Fairy Liuli were truly a couple.</p><p>He hesitated, unwilling to meddle in his master's affairs, and said, "There's something I must report to Master."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Fairy Liuli is currently not in the Storm World.  She's publicly claimed to be in seclusion at the Xuan Tian Palace to avoid causing unrest and alerting the Changyou tribe.  Only I and Palace Master Tong know this," Li Yu-fu said gravely.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. "Liuli's not in the Storm World? Where did she go?"</p><p>Li Yu-fu shook his head. "I don't know! Before leaving, Fairy Liuli mentioned that the Changyou tribe's leader was attempting a breakthrough to the Emptiness Realm.  If he succeeds, no one will be able to stop him!  Fairy Liuli went on a journey to seek an opportunity for her own breakthrough.  The Changyou tribe also knows about the Azure Spirit Qi and, having recovered a significant amount of their strength by acquiring it, the tribe leader's advancement is likely due to it."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Liuli's travels were undoubtedly extremely dangerous.  With only the power of the Transformation stage, how could she navigate amidst countless alien races? Even if she used secret methods to disguise herself, encountering a Void Realm level two expert could expose her.</p><p>Furthermore, the Heavenly Department is too far from Kanzhou.  Using the alien race's teleportation array to leave the Mist Sea and cross the ocean to Kanzhou is virtually impossible.</p><p>The best-case scenario is that she hasn't left the Zhuyan tribe's territory yet, and I can try to find her.</p><p>With Liuli's whereabouts unknown, further speculation was useless. Qin Sang's eyes flashed as he asked, "You said the Azure Spirit Qi found in the Foul Lands, did it come from the Abyssal Ruins?"</p><p>According to Li Yu-fu, after the Storm World merged into the Greater World, the Abyssal Ruins didn't appear.  Qin Sang suspected the Abyssal Ruins had sunk into the Foul Lands, or perhaps the two were originally one.</p><p>Years ago, he had personally visited the Abyssal Ruins and was awestruck by the mysterious sights from afar. The Abyssal Ruins must still hold many secrets.  Unfortunately, Li Yu-fu didn't have any Azure Spirit Qi on hand, making it impossible to judge its nature from the descriptions.</p><p>"No one has ever seen the Abyssal Ruins firsthand. I only know from ancient texts, and I can't be certain.  The Foul Qi ebbs and flows, with a minor low tide every hundred years or so, exposing parts of the Foul Lands. At that time, some Azure Spirit Qi will dissipate. Because Foul Qi still lingers there, those with insufficient cultivation will perish if they get too close.  The low tide is brief, and no one dares to explore deeply. We can only collect the Azure Spirit Qi from the outside," Li Yu-fu explained.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, secretly deciding he should also see the Foul Lands for himself, to determine if it was the River of Evil.</p><p>Dismissing that thought, Qin Sang asked, "How is Qingyang Temple faring?"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Taking a day off for the Dragon Boat Festival, spending time with family.</p><p>Wishing everyone a happy Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
