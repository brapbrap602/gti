<h1>Chapter 2009 Lian City</h1><p>The Blood-Soiling Radiance, with its ability to obscure a spirit weapon's consciousness, is undoubtedly a treasure coveted by all refiners.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously felt that the Intertwined Blood Mulberry was somewhat undeserving of its name. From artifact to spirit treasure to innate spirit treasure, the Blood-Soiling Radiance's effectiveness was clearly diminishing. It could no longer directly disable an opponent's reliance during a duel, achieving a decisive victory as it once did.</p><p>This, it turned out, was why the Intertwined Blood Mulberry was ranked among the Ten Great Divine Trees.</p><p>Recalling the battle before the Ziwei Palace, Elder Ye and Zuyuan were truly wasteful.</p><p>However, Storm World's Nascent Soul cultivators would never come into contact with spirit weapons. For them, the Intertwined Blood Mulberry's greatest value was its least useful aspect. Whether or not it was wasted is a matter of personal opinion.</p><p>He had thought that before reviving the Ziwei lineage, he would need to be cautious and keep the Cloud Touring Sword hidden. Unexpectedly, a twist of fate allowed it to become an aid in his refining path.</p><p>“I wonder what kind of secret technique is needed to refine the Blood-Soiling Radiance. The refinement process must be difficult, and such techniques are surely kept secret by various sects and not easily passed on.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, then indirectly inquired.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Elder Qi didn't know this secret technique. Such techniques could not be widely circulated in the Grand Thousand World, and the Ten Great Divine Trees were exceedingly rare.  A secret technique without the divine tree would simply be forgotten over time.</p><p>Finding the secret technique would be far easier than finding an Intertwined Blood Mulberry.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Elder Qi that the Five Elements League had long collected numerous refining techniques and Dao of Refinement inheritances.  Guest elders, after making sufficient contributions to the League, would gain access to these, possibly acquiring one or several techniques—a key method used by the League to attract talent.</p><p>"Contributions" were assessed in various ways. The safest approach was to refine numerous treasures for the Five Elements League, but this would be time-consuming.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that even if the Five Elements League possessed such a technique, it would not be easily accessible. He couldn't be impatient.</p><p>Through Elder Qi, Qin Sang not only discovered many secrets but also gained a deep understanding of the rules governing the refining path in the Grand Thousand World, making his future actions much easier.</p><p>Just as the two were engrossed in their conversation, the outer restrictions were triggered, and Zhao, the steward's voice came, "Elder Qi, a message has arrived from headquarters."</p><p>"It must be news from the League," Elder Qi rose, "Please wait patiently, Daoist Qin."</p><p>After a short time, Elder Qi returned to the quiet room with a smile, offering congratulations. "Congratulations, Daoist Qin! As expected, the League will not refuse any refining grandmaster. As long as you're willing to join the Five Elements League, a guest elder position awaits you.  Once you have this token, you can command the League's resources anytime, anywhere, in any branch! However, before granting you the elder token, you need to do something for the League, to prove your abilities.”</p><p>"This is expected. I wonder what the League requires of me?" </p><p>Qin Sang asked. The process was easier than he anticipated, probably involving refining a spirit treasure.</p><p>As Qin Sang guessed, Elder Qi said,</p><p>“Normally, the League would send other elders to meet you. However, the League is currently busy with an important matter, and the elders in Jade Capital are too occupied to visit you personally. We apologize for the lack of formality. You only need to refine several treasures here at this branch. After completion, the League will pay you the same compensation as other guest elders. If you have no other requests, I’ll immediately arrange a workshop and have the materials delivered.”</p><p>The purpose was to obtain an elder token; the compensation was secondary.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.  "How long will it take to refine those treasures?"</p><p>Refining, especially spirit treasures, often took years. He was afraid that a long delay would affect his plans to retrieve his sword.</p><p>As his sword spirit had mentioned, the struggle for the Zhou King's succession had attracted the attention of the entire world, representing an unparalleled opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "With the Zhou King's death and the new king yet to be chosen, Jade Capital is rife with unrest, and I fear major chaos will erupt. I want to leave this turbulent place as soon as possible."</p><p>“Unless someone tries to revoke the Zhou King’s title, how could Jade Capital fall into chaos? The powerful figures above are still debating, and it will take at least a decade or more to affect us. But your concerns are not entirely unfounded…”</p><p>Elder Qi was unconcerned, calculating silently,  "If you are eager to leave, half a year should suffice."</p><p>The time was shorter than expected, and Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>Elder Qi led Qin Sang out of the quiet room toward the back hall. "Our League has five-element workshops and some specialized ones. Which would you prefer?"</p><p>"I usually use fire," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Elder Qi wasn't surprised.  All five elements had their refining traditions, each with unique characteristics, with fire being the most common.</p><p>A fire chamber.  Elder Qi left Qin Sang, returning after a while with a wooden ring.</p><p>The ring bore a simple inscription:  a single character for "wood".</p><p>"The materials and diagrams are inside the ring.  If you have any questions, I'll be in the next chamber," Elder Qi indicated a nearby workshop, bowed, and departed.</p><p>A large formation was activated, sealing the chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang probed the ring with their spiritual sense.  Rows upon rows of materials were neatly arranged.</p><p>Surprisingly, these materials weren't exceptionally rare, but their variety was astonishing.</p><p>At the back, Qin Sang found a scroll made of an unfamiliar animal hide.</p><p>Unrolling the scroll, an extremely detailed diagram was revealed.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recognized it. "It's a… magical artifact! No, part of one!"</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance hadn't tasked them with refining a treasure, but a magical artifact.</p><p>Certain specialized artifacts possessed extraordinary power; their refinement was as difficult as, or even more so than, refining treasures. The large flying artifacts common in Yue Du Bay were prime examples.</p><p>The diagram showed three images:  a dragon head, a tiger head, and a phoenix beak.</p><p>These weren't actual mythical creatures, just stylistic choices. The three heads were structurally similar, the key differences being the internal runes and mechanisms.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over it. One word sufficed:  exquisite!</p><p>No wonder they needed a master refiner.</p><p>The diverse materials, some with conflicting properties, required exquisite techniques.  They had to be refined into individual components, then assembled into a whole, avoiding conflicts, supporting the runes, and achieving a synergistic effect.</p><p>Even a single head contained an unimaginable number of components, ranging in size from human-sized to microscopic.  Refinement might not take a long time, but it demanded exceptional control.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't guarantee success every time, thankfully, the Five Elements Alliance had provided extra materials.</p><p>Their arrangement was clever:  the artifact was divided into independent parts, each refined separately.  Knowing only their part, a refiner couldn't deduce the artifact's nature.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected they'd been given the easier parts.  The main body must be far more complex, refined by the Alliance elders who were otherwise occupied.</p><p>Dismissing these thoughts, Qin Sang immersed themselves in the diagram, studying it intently, starting with the simplest components and refining while learning.</p><p>During the process, Qin Sang left the Alliance several times to meet with Jian Nu and update them.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated the task would take six months to a year, a reasonable timeframe.  Contacting Tian Yue Ren, awaiting their arrangements, and then executing the plan would still take much longer.</p><p>They set a departure date with Jian Nu to avoid entanglement, agreeing to minimize contact and maintain secrecy.</p><p>Six months later.</p><p>In the Five Elements Alliance workshop.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, surrounded by fiery red light.  A fire dragon circled above their head.</p><p>The dragon encircled a mass of golden liquid.  Impurities were constantly refined away, revealing golden veins within.  These veins were gradually drawn out as extremely fine golden threads.  Once a complete thread was extracted, the liquid lost its luster.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  The thread stiffened, and with a flick of their sleeve, "bang!" countless components exploded before them.</p><p>The thread darted between the components, weaving them together in the blink of an eye, forming a near-perfect tiger head.  Suddenly, the tiger's eyes opened, fierce and menacing.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was serious.  They flicked their fingers, sending streams of light into the head, gradually subduing the ferocity, finally forming a tiger head the size of half the workshop.</p><p>Its jaws were open, powerful and imposing.  Looking directly at its mouth evoked a sense of danger, as if it could unleash a devastating attack.</p><p>"A cannon muzzle?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, but didn't dwell on it, resuming the refinement after meditation.</p><p>Ten months later, Qin Sang completed the dragon, tiger, and phoenix heads, and summoned Elder Qi.</p><p>Three heads were sufficient to demonstrate their skill.  More would bring more reward, but Qin Sang couldn't wait.</p><p>"Elder Qin's skill is truly profound!" Elder Qi commented upon seeing them, addressing Qin Sang as 'Elder'.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Elder Qi, Qin Sang had used their own blood during refinement, incorporating the Chong Xuan Sect's blood refinement technique.  The goal: to impress the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>Elder Qi collected the heads.  "Since Elder Qin is leaving, I won't detain you. We'll meet again.  Please state your desired compensation, and I will submit it for approval."</p><p>"How much Thousand-Feather Silk can you give me?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Thousand-Feather Silk is one of the essential materials for constructing a Daoist altar, and the demand is far less than that of Azure Mark Essence.</p><p>"Thousand-Feather Silk…"</p><p>Elder Qi pondered for a moment.  "Usually, about three zhang. However, I can try to get five zhang for Elder Qin.  Considering your recent joining of the Alliance, they might be more accommodating, as a gesture of goodwill."</p><p>"In that case, I thank Elder Qi,"</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude.</p><p>"It's a small matter," Elder Qi dismissed it casually. "Just wait for my good news, Elder Qin."</p><p>Not long after, Elder Qi returned, bringing back five zhang of Thousand-Feather Silk and an Elder's token.</p><p>The Thousand-Feather Silk resembled thin cords, multicolored and vibrant, as if woven from countless bird feathers.</p><p>Azure Mark Essence, Thousand-Feather Silk…</p><p>Two materials acquired.  Gathering them one by one, I will eventually build my own altar.</p><p>After a brief exchange with Elder Qi, Qin Sang left the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>Jian Nu had already requested leave from the Zhou Palace, disguised himself, and was waiting for Qin Sang's departure.</p><p>After meeting up, Jian Nu, posing as Qin Sang's disciple, headed towards an official residence in the Thirtieth Heaven.  When Qin Sang arrived, he was an independent cultivator, but upon his departure, he had become a guest elder of the Five Elements Alliance. The Great Teleportation Array fees were significantly reduced; Qin Sang paid a sum of Wu Hong silver and took Jian Nu onto the array.</p><p>They only had one jade talisman. During the teleportation, Qin Sang, with his stronger cultivation, had to protect both himself and Jian Nu.</p><p>Leaving Baiyu City, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel emotional. He had originally planned to admire the human race's sacred land and plan his future path, but ended up rushing in and rushing out, spending his days in the Five Elements Alliance's refining workshop.</p><p>…</p><p>'Crackle…'</p><p>They teleported from Baiyu City to Duizhou Prefecture City via the Great Teleportation Array.</p><p>As Qin Sang and Jian Nu stepped out of the array, they first felt the humid air and heard the sound of rain hitting the water and lotus leaves.</p><p>The sky was dark and gloomy.</p><p>Thick, impenetrable clouds covered all directions.  The rain fell in a steady drizzle, not heavy, yet it carried a persistent melancholy, seemingly never-ending.</p><p>It is said that the weather in Duizhou is always like this, the entire prefecture almost entirely situated within a vast swamp.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his feet; beneath him were vibrant green lotus leaves, their undersides clinging to the water's surface like green plates, floating without sinking, remarkably resilient.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, countless lotus leaves densely covered the surroundings. These "lotus leaves," varying in size, some actually being duckweeds, stretched to the horizon, where countless more green specks dotted the landscape.</p><p>This is Duizhou, one of the Eight Great Heavenly Prefectures—its prefecture city, a fairy city built upon lotus leaves and duckweed, spread across the swamp!</p><p>Thus, it earned its name—Lotus City.</p><p>These lotus plants are called Qingwang Lotuses, a unique species. Their leaves range from several zhang to several thousand zhang in size, said to grow only in Duizhou's capital. They wither when taken elsewhere.  Humans who consume the seeds gain longevity; the leaves are a resilient spiritual material, strong enough to support pavilions and towers.</p><p>Lotus City isn't completely flat; the lotus leaves are at varying heights, connected by arched bridges made from lotus stalks, creating a stunning and varied landscape.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the water surface of Lotus City is only about one zhang deep above the swamp below.</p><p>Yet standing here, there's no trace of foul odor, only the refreshing fragrance of lotus leaves.</p><p>Even more peculiar, for countless years, Duizhou has been perpetually shrouded in dark clouds, with constant rain; yet the water level remains unchanged.</p><p>As Qin Sang shifted his foot, a subtle tremor rippled through the lotus leaves, sending gentle waves across the water's surface.</p>
