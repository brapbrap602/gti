<h1>Chapter 443: Three Years</h1><p>Di, the Golden Core cultivator, immediately agreed, "Rest assured, Island Master, I'll send a message back to my sect."</p><p>Snake Mistress 'hmmed', a 'Cold' character ancient command appearing in her palm, and said in a deep voice, "In the name of Stargazing Island's Island Master, I command the Cold Region! This is a matter of life and death..."</p><p>All the Core Formation cultivators on the island,</p><p>regardless of righteous or demonic sects, Yin Mountain Pass rogue cultivators, even the snake-bodied man who revealed his true form, all had serious expressions, patiently waiting for Snake Mistress to issue her commands word by word.</p><p>They all bowed their hands to Snake Mistress and accepted the order!</p><p>...</p><p>The Heavenly Mandate Alliance retreated, but that didn't mean they were safe. Qin Sang and the other Foundation Establishment cultivators weren't qualified to participate in the discussions. They recovered their spiritual power while stealing glances at the small island in the center.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators gathered on the island to discuss, no one knew what kind of rules would be set.</p><p>Their fate was not in their own hands, but in the hands of others.</p><p>After all the Golden Core cultivators saluted Snake Mistress, Che Yutao glanced over.</p><p>Then, Zhan Yi, who was sitting cross-legged beside Qin Sang, was called to Che Yutao. He took a token-like object and flew north out of the Sea of Mist, nodding to Qin Sang before leaving.</p><p>Many others left with him, including several Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang and the others finally received clear orders.</p><p>Everyone was assigned to small teams based on their cultivation level, then each chose a small island within the formation to cultivate. Without orders, no one was allowed to leave.</p><p>...</p><p>Three years passed.</p><p>The Chaotic Islands underwent earth-shaking changes.</p><p>The Cold Region spared no effort, repeatedly strengthening the spiritual formation.  The True Water Mirage Formation was now far more powerful than before, and its range had expanded several times over.</p><p>Now, the entire Chaotic Islands were enveloped by the True Water Mirage Formation. A rectangular space, oriented east-west, had been opened up within the Sea of Mist, covering a considerable area.</p><p>The Cold Region cultivators relied on the islands and the True Water Mirage Formation to confront the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.</p><p>The Heavenly Mandate Alliance also had a similar base, located directly south of the Chaotic Islands, in a place called Taiqing Lake.  A vast expanse of water separated the two sides; this was the battlefield.</p><p>Early morning.</p><p>The mist gradually dissipated, and the water's surface was as smooth as a mirror, exceptionally calm.</p><p>Not a single bird flew by.</p><p>This wasn't surprising; there had been very few birds in the vicinity for the past three years.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A metallic clang in the distance broke the silence.</p><p>Immediately afterward, dozens of differently colored streaks of light flew towards them, chasing each other.  Between the streaks, sword qi, blade auras, and the glow of other magical artifacts flashed.</p><p>Clearly, these cultivators were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>Their cultivation levels were all quite high, with the lowest being early Foundation Establishment, and even some late Foundation Establishment experts among them.</p><p>One side pursued, the other retreated, fighting as they fled.  Though at a disadvantage, their formation remained unbroken, and they showed no signs of imminent collapse.</p><p>'Whoosh... whoosh...'</p><p>Streaks of light flew overhead one after another.</p><p>At this moment, unnoticed by anyone, a shadow silently appeared on the water's surface, hiding beneath the surface and secretly observing the battle.</p><p>Hidden within the shadow was a personâ€”who else but Qin Sang?</p><p>Qin Sang watched with wide eyes.</p><p>The retreating side were Cold Region cultivators, including a fellow disciple, Senior Brother Mu Yifeng.</p><p>As for those pursuing them, it had to be the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.</p><p>Over the past three years, this scene had played out countless times, sometimes with the Cold Region cultivators being chased, sometimes the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.</p><p>The battle in the air was fierce, with magical artifacts constantly colliding and spells flying.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. His brow flickered, and the Ebony Wood Sword flew out on its own, then its form vanished as it flew towards the battlefield.</p><p>Soon, the Ebony Wood Sword approached the battle. Qin Sang's gaze darted around, finally settling on a middle-aged man in brocade robes.</p><p>This man wasn't the highest cultivated among the Heavenly Mandate Alliance, but he was a late Foundation Establishment expert, quite powerful.  He could fight Mu Yifeng without falling behind and even seemed to be slightly suppressing him.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the middle-aged man and the Heavenly Mandate Alliance's formation. Finally, he saw an opening and his eyes lit up.  His lips parted slightly: "Go!"</p><p>A clap of thunder suddenly echoed through the clear sky.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword reappeared, transitioning from stillness to motion in an instant, displaying extreme speed.  The sword light flashed like lightning, reaching the middle-aged man's back in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"I knew you were treacherous..."</p><p>The middle-aged man sneered.  He had been prepared; a profound spiritual diagram suddenly appeared on his seemingly unguarded back.</p><p>The spiritual diagram manifested profound light; it was clearly not ordinary.</p><p>An ordinary flying sword would certainly be easily blocked by the spiritual diagram.</p><p>Unfortunately, he encountered Qin Sang and the Ebony Wood Sword!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use the Blood Corruption Divine Light.</p><p>The Blood Corruption Divine Light was one of his greatest trump cards.  He would only use it if he could ensure a kill and no one else was around to witness it.</p><p>He had only used it once in the past three years.</p><p>However, with the Sword Qi Thunderclap technique and the sharpness of the Ebony Wood Sword itself, Qin Sang could handle most dangerous situations, and had even made quite a name for himself.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Sword Qi Thunderclap was incredibly fast. Before the profound light could fully form, the Ebony Wood Sword arrived, shattering it.</p><p>The spiritual diagram wasn't spared either, but it wasn't completely destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't get greedy; he immediately retrieved the Ebony Wood Sword. It was precisely because he used the Ebony Wood Sword cautiously that no one had yet realized it was a magical treasure.</p><p>This was enough.  The middle-aged man hadn't expected the sneak attack to be so powerful. His body stiffened, and Mu Yifeng, who was fighting him, seized the opportunity, his divine blade flashing like lightning.</p><p>"Sword Qi Thunderclap..."</p><p>The sneer on the middle-aged man's face froze. His eyes filled with terror. Unable to dodge, he was pierced through the chest by the Nine Fires Divine Blade and died.</p><p>"Not good, it's the Shadowless Sword!"</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>The other Heavenly Mandate Alliance cultivators cried out in terror.  Without hesitation, they turned and fled, not even bothering with their companion's corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly to himself.</p><p>After three years of battles, he had made quite a name for himself, earning the moniker "Shadowless Sword", taking the name of the Wuji Sect's famed technique.</p><p>This made the Wuji Sect disciples quite unhappy with him.</p><p>With the enemy retreating decisively and their formation unbroken, Qin Sang and the others chose to give up the chase.  They divided the spoils, and Qin Sang returned alone to the Chaotic Islands.</p><p>After flying for a while, a gigantic wall of mist appeared in the north, completely blocking Qin Sang's view.</p><p>The mist reached the sky and never dispersed, stretching endlessly east and west.</p><p>Seeing the Sea of Mist, Qin Sang finally felt at ease and boldly flew on the Stygian Cloud, heading straight for the wall of mist. He raised the token he had prepared earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang felt himself tighten.  The token emitted a milky white light. Upon touching the mist, a bright light shot out from the depths of the Sea of Mist, transforming into a narrow passage that appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>It seemed Qin Sang was well-versed in this procedure.</p><p>He continued on the cloud, passing through the passage.</p><p>After flying some distance through the Sea of Mist, the view ahead suddenly opened up.</p><p>A light rain fell, making the scene somewhat dim, but it didn't obstruct his vision.</p>
