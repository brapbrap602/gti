<h1>Chapter 1428: Annihilation</h1><p>'Swish!'</p><p>In the secret passage, illuminated by the blazing aura and shimmering seals, the streak of light, like a bolt of lightning, remained incomparably dazzling.</p><p>As he fled, Qin Sang could clearly sense the powerful aura behind him closing in rapidly. The fastest among them was undoubtedly Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>"So fast!"</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>He had heard of such a saying before.</p><p>Due to the extreme difficulty in breaking through the Deity Transformation bottleneck, there would be significant differences in strength between Grand Cultivators.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo was clearly not among the weak.</p><p>Such a powerful figure, standing at the pinnacle of the cultivation world, had enough time and means in his long lifespan to compensate for his weaknesses, leaving no obvious shortcomings in any aspect.</p><p>What puzzled Qin Sang was, where had the Ghost Spirit that Old Devil Hunmo used to plot against Valley Master Mu gone?</p><p>He had not come into contact with the Ghost Spirit, but from just one glance, he had sensed deep malice from it, undoubtedly a terrifying fiend.</p><p>The Core Formation Talisman Puppet was originally intended to deal with the Ghost Spirit.</p><p>If Old Devil Hunmo had released the Ghost Spirit, Qin Sang believed he would not have succeeded so easily. To snatch away the Treasure Pearl and blessed Treasure Pestle was a fortunate outcome; there would have been no chance to contend for the Seven-Story Pagoda.</p><p>Unless he was willing to take even greater risks.</p><p>Perhaps that Ghost Spirit was under some kind of restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang mused inwardly.</p><p>As thoughts raced through his mind, Qin Sang returned to the edge of the mountain pass.</p><p>'Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Muffled sounds emanated from within the mountain's belly.</p><p>The walls of the secret passage bulged, and the Ancient Seals and Buddhist restrictions released dazzling light. Unfortunately, it was a final burst of glory, the cracks in the seals widening and spreading at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Sealed within was a violent and terrifying power, about to break free!</p><p>One could imagine that once this power erupted, not only this mountain and this secret passage, but the entire Pure Sea Sect would be razed to the ground, completely vanishing from the world.</p><p>Feeling the power within the seal, Qin Sang's scalp tingled, and he dared not hesitate for even a moment.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>He swiftly passed along the other side of the wall.</p><p>At the same time, he forcefully waved his sleeve, and the Nine Nether Demonic Flames enveloping his body were unleashed once more.</p><p>However, the target of the Demonic Flames was not the pursuers behind him, but the seal!</p><p>The seal did not collapse immediately after the Golden Peak Buddhist restrictions were broken. This gave Qin Sang the opportunity to escape the secret passage, and it could be used by Qin Sang to startle the pursuers!</p><p>When he had passed through this place earlier, Qin Sang had already pinpointed the weakest point of the seal, and rehearsed this scene in his mind.</p><p>The Demonic Flames condensed to the extreme, and crashed violently into that crack.</p><p>The seal, already at its breaking point, finally could not hold after being attacked from the outside!</p><p>At the point of impact.</p><p>A crack expanded, like the opening of an abyss.</p><p>A nearly silvery-white aura of crimson flames flowed out, as thick as liquid, overflowing from that crack, causing a chain of reactions. Wherever it flowed, the walls rapidly disappeared, and the dual seals dissolved.</p><p>The 'Swastika' character runes instantly dimmed.</p><p>The Ancient Seals were stronger, but since they were already damaged, they collapsed almost simultaneously with the Buddhist restrictions.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo chased into the secret passage, his pupils contracting like needles.</p><p>Until now, he had not seen his opponent.</p><p>The last image in his sight was the Demonic Flames pouncing on the seal. In an instant, Old Devil Hunmo understood his opponent's intent, that this secret passage actually passed through the seal.</p><p>In the next moment, the entire secret passage was filled with dazzling light.</p><p>As if another sun had appeared.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo felt a pang of fear, cursed, and without any other option, immediately flew backward, while unhesitatingly holding the Hunmo Token in front of him.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang only felt a buzzing in his ears, and instantly lost his hearing.</p><p>His eyes could not see the outline of the secret passage; his vision was filled with only blinding light.</p><p>"Played it too big..."</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind for a moment. The power of the crimson flame aura's eruption was more terrifying than expected.</p><p>Fortunately, this was his own doing, and he had a contingency plan. While fleeing rapidly, he immediately summoned the Core Formation Talisman Puppet to block behind him.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a tremendous force struck.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang only felt a burst of pain, let out a muffled groan, and was violently struck by the Core Formation Talisman Puppet, and then pushed forward staggering by the immense force.</p><p>He only felt that he was being roasted by flames, about to be burned to ashes. He did not have time to check the Core Formation Talisman Puppet's injuries, and retrieved it. He then gritted his teeth and fully activated his Protective Divineç½¡ (Protective Divine Armor), maintaining his form, and successfully rushed into the meditation hall, seeing the exit.</p><p>Tan Hao had already withdrawn from the Pure Sea Sect in advance. Qin Sang did not hesitate, and plunged out headfirst, immediately feeling a burst of coolness, having arrived at the seabed near the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>"Brother Qin, are you alright?"</p><p>Tan Hao had also just withdrawn at this time, turned his head and saw Qin Sang's embarrassed figure, first pleased, then greatly alarmed.</p><p>"Hurry up!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted sharply, grabbed Tan Hao, and lunged forward with force.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a torrent of heat gushed out of the secret passage, pouring into the sea, carrying astonishing power, directly slamming them out!</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Newly arrived Nascent Souls.</p><p>Some were attracted by the medicine garden, some were still hesitating which place to choose.</p><p>Before the Buddha Pagoda.</p><p>Master Chijie and the others were about to break the Buddha Pagoda's restrictions, startled by Old Devil Hunmo's roar, and looked towards the Golden Peak Great Hall with suspicion, not knowing what had happened.</p><p>At the moment the seal collapsed, all Nascent Souls felt a inexplicable palpitation, and everyone's eyes simultaneously focused on the mountain pass.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>That mountain suddenly exploded from the inside, and a stream of flames shot out like sharp arrows, stinging everyone's eyes.</p><p>Almost at the same moment, two figures rushed out of the Great Hall in embarrassment, precisely Old Devil Hunmo and Fairy Yuyi, with expressions of anger.</p><p>Immediately afterward.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Golden Peak Great Hall was overturned by a stream of flames, instantly breaking into pieces. The Buddha statue and stone statue had just seen the light of day again, and were swallowed by the flames.</p><p>"The seal has collapsed!"</p><p>Everyone immediately understood the cause.</p><p>Before they could react, a muffled thunder-like sound came from the depths of the earth, the entire Pure Sea Sect shook violently, and the ground seemed to rise slightly.</p><p>The 'Swastika' golden talisman slowly rotating at the mountain pass solidified and disintegrated.</p><p>The crimson flame aura finally had no restraints.</p><p>An extremely thick stream of flames shot straight into the sky.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>The anomaly had not disappeared, but its power had weakened compared to the beginning.</p><p>Nascent Soul Ancestors, rarely seen at ordinary times, had appeared here one after another, entering the formation.</p><p>The remaining low-level cultivators dared not enter, but could not suppress their curiosity, harboring a desire for opportunity, circling around nearby without leaving.</p><p>Some Core Formation cultivators, relying on their cultivation, entered the sea pit, probing at the edge of the spiritual array, waiting for a chance to enter.</p><p>"What's that sound?"</p><p>Suddenly someone asked in confusion.</p><p>Everyone suddenly stopped their actions, and all looked towards the spiritual array.</p><p>'Splash...'</p><p>The seawater inexplicably boiled.</p><p>They sensed terrible fluctuations from within, a force beyond their imagination, about to erupt.</p><p>What had those Nascent Soul Ancestors been doing inside?</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>Everyone's faces turned pale suddenly, fear surged in their hearts, their expressions were panic-stricken, and they rushed out of the sea pit without looking back.</p>
