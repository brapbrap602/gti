<h1>Chapter 595: The Killing Talismans</h1><p>“These two killing talismans are the culmination of my life's work, created to repair the cultivation technique.  I regret some shortcomings.  After years of honing my swordsmanship, I achieved new insights, but was pursued by powerful enemies, forcing me to flee through an ancient teleportation array. My future is uncertain. If anyone finds this, I hope they will inherit my will and continue this path tirelessly.  May the power of the Killing Dao Sword Scripture be revived one day…”</p><p>He inscribed the characters ‘Qingzhu’ using sword energy at the end.</p><p>The inscription is extremely messy, hastily carved with sword energy.  It's clear the writer was in a desperate hurry, just as the inscription states – pursued by enemies, forced to flee through an ancient teleportation array.</p><p>Unaware of the dangers on the other side of the array, fearing he would never return and his life's work would be lost, he left the talismans before his departure.</p><p>He hoped that future cultivators of the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* would discover this ancient hall, use this foundation to continue repairing the technique, and allow this unique cultivation method to see the light of day.</p><p>This was an act of great love, guiding future generations.</p><p>Perhaps it was also a testament to his unwilling retreat, leaving a mark in the Xiao Han region.</p><p>Qin Sang silently read the inscription, filled with respect.</p><p>He was grateful for Qingzhu's selflessness and amazed by his talent.</p><p>With an incomplete cultivation technique, his path cut off, and no guidance, he didn't switch to another technique.  Instead, he relentlessly forged ahead, creating two killing talismans and forging a new path.</p><p>The two killing talismans represent two levels of the technique.  This suggests Qingzhu's cultivation base before his departure was at least late-stage Core Formation.</p><p>Yet he was relentlessly pursued by powerful enemies, utterly defenseless, and forced to use the ancient teleportation array to escape to an unknown location.</p><p>Were his enemies Yuan Ying masters?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the details, but from previous stories of Qingzhu and bits of information from Old Madam Jing, he could piece together some ideas.</p><p>Qingzhu was banished from Shao Hua Mountain because of a woman, but the mountain didn't pursue him further.</p><p>His only known enemy was the Yuan Shen Sect, and Qin Sang suspected that Leng Yuntian was the mastermind.</p><p>Leng Yuntian was seriously injured at Ziwei Palace years ago and hasn't recovered. His forced Yuan Ying breakthrough resulted in only pseudo-Yuan Ying strength.  Could Qingzhu be the one who attacked him?</p><p>Did he ambush Leng Yuntian in Ziwei Palace for revenge?</p><p>If so, then it was likely Leng Qian, the then-sect master of Yuan Shen Sect, who pursued Qingzhu!</p><p>Not long after Ziwei Palace resurfaced, Leng Qian died of old age, having long groomed Leng Yuntian as his successor.</p><p>How could Leng Qian, who had invested so much in his successor, not be enraged when his heir was nearly killed? He would undoubtedly want to tear the culprit to pieces.</p><p>However, these are just Qin Sang's speculations.</p><p>Only the people involved know what truly happened back then.</p><p>The two killing talismans were meticulously crafted, with flowing sword energy and hidden killing intent, inheriting the essence of the first five levels of the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*.</p><p>However, upon careful examination, Qin Sang discovered subtle differences.</p><p>The talismans contained much of Qingzhu's personal insights; in creating them, he unconsciously integrated his own Dao comprehension into them.</p><p>The *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* is simple yet comprehensive, encompassing all things.  Everyone can interpret it differently and find their own path.</p><p>However, Qingzhu's self-created technique was much narrower, best suited only to himself.</p><p>This was related to his cultivation level and vision. The creator of the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* must have been an unparalleled expert, while Qingzhu was just a humble Core Formation cultivator.  There's a world of difference between them.</p><p>For Qingzhu to reach this point was already extraordinary, a once-in-a-millennium genius!</p><p>Because of this, if someone else were to obtain this, even if they cultivated the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*, it would be difficult to follow Qingzhu's path exactly.  They would need to make adjustments to suit themselves; otherwise, it would go against their nature, and the higher their cultivation, the greater the discrepancy, potentially leading to a demonic obsession.</p><p>But Qin Sang was different. He clearly wanted only rapid advancement in cultivation.  He treated the technique as a tool, purely using the talismans to cultivate, his heart unaffected under the Jade Buddha's protection.  Changing paths would have no impact on his nature, especially a minor alteration.</p><p>Once he reached mid-stage Core Formation, he could follow Qingzhu's path precisely without any modification.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently, memorizing the killing talismans and comprehending the subsequent techniques.</p><p>Although created by Elder Qingzhu himself, the techniques are incredibly profound.  Most are beyond Qin Sang's current understanding, but even with his limited experience, he can see that this path is viable!</p><p>Qin Sang hastily memorized the first killing talisman, then his gaze sharpened as he looked at the second.</p><p>This talisman was incomplete, seemingly lacking the final stroke!</p><p>Examining the true meaning of the technique hidden within the talisman confirmed the missing element.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's regret in his message referred to this missing stroke. It seems his cultivation was very close to the peak of late-stage Core Formation, only the final breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage remained elusive.</p><p>After the trials of the Sword Path, Elder Qingzhu gained further insights and finally completed the technique, but it was too late.</p><p>What a pity!</p><p>Qin Sang's sigh echoed through the ancient hall.</p><p>Although it seems like just one final stroke, it shouldn't be underestimated.  It must not be engraved casually.</p><p>The entire talisman must be perfectly integrated, without the slightest imperfection.  Otherwise, at best, the talisman will collapse and cultivation will plummet; at worst, even the Black Wood Sword could shatter.</p><p>Qin Sang committed both talismans to memory, then calmed himself, putting aside his regret.</p><p>Gaining access to Elder Qingzhu's self-created advanced techniques is already a great surprise. These two talismans are sufficient to support his cultivation to the late stage of Core Formation. That leaves considerable time; perhaps there will be another chance.</p><p>Failing that, he can always enter seclusion for intensive cultivation and research.</p><p>It's just one stroke; however dull his aptitude, he will find a solution.</p><p>After memorizing the talismans, Qin Sang bowed before Elder Qingzhu's message, expressing his gratitude for the guidance, then turned to the ancient teleportation array in the center of the altar, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's remains were not found in the ancient hall or the Sword Path, suggesting a successful teleportation.</p><p>Clearly, the ancient teleportation array was functional then.</p><p>However, whether it still functions is highly questionable.</p><p>Qin Sang honestly asked himself:  If it were him, pursued relentlessly by a Nascent Soul master, facing imminent death, his first act after teleporting would be to destroy the teleportation array on the other side.</p><p>The Sword Path in the ancient hall, however formidable, might not withstand a Nascent Soul master.  Only by destroying the teleportation array could he resolve the immediate danger.</p><p>This would cut off his own retreat, making it impossible to return if it could not be repaired, but those are concerns for later.</p><p>In all likelihood, this ancient teleportation array is unusable.</p><p>After considering this, Qin Sang retrieved eight mid-grade spirit stones from his storage pouch.</p>
