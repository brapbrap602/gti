<h1>Chapter 1566: Late Nascent Soul Stage</h1><p>Chapter 1566: Late Nascent Soul Stage</p><p>Qin Sang's physical manifestation returned to the Qingxu Enclave and immediately activated the protective barrier, personally guarding the entrance to the cave dwelling.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The manifestation suddenly stood up and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The sky was high and the clouds were light.  The Qingxu Enclave was located atop Mount Pu, offering an unobstructed view of the surrounding landscape.  After Qin Sang ordered the closure of Mount Pu, Xie An had been extremely busy managing affairs in Fudou County and recalling Xie family disciples.</p><p>At that moment, several young men were returning together, laughing and chatting as they flew towards the mountain gate. The disciples guarding the gate opened the entrance for them, exchanged greetings, and discussed recent events inside and outside the mountain.</p><p>They were engrossed in their conversation, oblivious to the changing celestial phenomena within the Qingxu Enclave.</p><p>First, a gentle breeze arose.</p><p>The wind grew stronger.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Leaves fell like rain.  These were green leaves, not yet the season for autumnal shedding, yet they were violently torn from the branches.  The forest’s undergrowth was flattened, utterly destroying the previous beauty.</p><p>The winds converged in mid-air, and the sky gradually darkened, as if covered by a layer of dark clouds. The area above the cave dwelling was particularly dense.  This was not actual cloud cover, but a celestial phenomenon created by intensely concentrated spiritual energy; the spiritual energy in the void was rapidly converging there.</p><p>The manifestation quickly scanned the surroundings, confirmed that the anomaly wouldn't affect the outside world, and then focused its attention on the cave dwelling.</p><p>Within moments, a visible tide of spiritual energy appeared above the cave dwelling, magnificent and imposing.  Then, a sudden upheaval shook the entire Qingxu Enclave, accompanied by a shrill whistling sound.</p><p>The spiritual energy swirled and then plummeted.  A waterfall of spiritual energy appeared in the void, pouring into the cave dwelling!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The cave dwelling trembled violently; the protective barrier shone brightly, bathing the manifestation’s face in multicolored light.</p><p>The manifestation’s expression shifted slightly, its gaze turning to the center of the cave dwelling.</p><p>The next moment, the spiritual energy waterfall suddenly reversed, and within it, a figure emerged, rising against the flow, surging towards the center of the spiritual energy.  Not only was it unharmed, but its body seemed to absorb the spiritual energy like a whale, draining it completely.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon came and went quickly, revealing the figure of the main body.</p><p>The main body hovered in mid-air, eyes closed, motionless.</p><p>This tranquility did not last long.  The main body, apparently not having completely refined the absorbed spiritual energy, suddenly began to experience a surge in its aura, a powerful and rapidly escalating increase.</p><p>Unfortunately, this breakthrough momentum abruptly halted; it had clearly encountered a bottleneck.</p><p>The main body let out a cold snort.  The stagnation lasted only an instant; the aura surged again, the bottleneck overcome with ease.</p><p>Late Nascent Soul Stage achieved!</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>A joyous laugh echoed through the Qingxu Enclave.</p><p>The main body stood in the air, robes billowing, a look of exhilaration on its brow, laughing up at the heavens.</p><p>Diligence bears fruit. After more than a hundred years of seclusion, enduring immense solitude, the breakthrough was finally achieved today!</p><p>To this day, less than three hundred years have passed since Qin Sang’s Nascent Soul stage. His first tribulation of forty-nine days is still two or three decades away.</p><p>If this were to spread, it would undoubtedly cause a sensation in the cultivation world. Even cultivators from the major sects of the Central Plains, who have access to endless resources, rarely achieve such results. This was undoubtedly the mark of an unparalleled genius.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The laughter ceased, and the main body appeared beside its manifestation, exchanging a smile. The second Nascent Soul returned to the main body, conveying events of the past years.</p><p>Qin Sang absentmindedly reviewed various messages while reminiscing about his more than hundred years of seclusion.</p><p>After obtaining the Qingxu Enclave, the main body had set up the cave dwelling and begun its seclusion. This was the first time it had left the cave dwelling.</p><p>The monotonous cultivation need not be described.</p><p>Twenty years ago, upon reaching the bottleneck of the late Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang had begun preparing for the breakthrough. Before that, he had naturally organized his cultivation path, identified and corrected shortcomings, consolidated his realm, and ensured he was in perfect condition.</p><p>This process went smoothly.  He was, to a certain degree, a cultivator of the mind, body, and spirit, with a more solid foundation than other cultivators.</p><p>More than ten years ago, Qin Sang sensed he could attempt a breakthrough, and he had a significant chance of success.</p><p>However, the speed of his advancement left him feeling somewhat uneasy.  Since he had no worries about tribulations or lifespan, he decided to consolidate his cultivation further to ensure foolproof success.</p><p>After ten years of preparation, a final push broke through the bottleneck—a natural progression!</p><p>The Cleansing Pool and the Killing Talisman accelerated cultivation without altering his innate constitution.  The Buddha Bone Relic played a crucial role in this smooth advancement, and the contribution of the *Fire Seed Lotus* shouldn't be overlooked.</p><p>Reaching the Spirit Body Transformation stage ahead of schedule aided the breakthrough, once again confirming Elder Qingzhu's earlier conjecture.</p><p>Cultivating spirit, energy, and body simultaneously benefits the breakthrough.</p><p>Even in the Central Plains, Grand Cultivators stand at the pinnacle.  Nascent Soul cultivators are few and far between, and now, with several mysteriously missing, even fewer can rival them.</p><p>Qin Sang was elated. He examined his inner self.</p><p>His Nascent Soul was more substantial, but it was only a minor advancement; major breakthroughs offer qualitative leaps.</p><p>The most noticeable change was the greater depth of his true essence.</p><p>While he previously possessed strength comparable to Grand Cultivators, his limited true essence always restricted him; he had to either fight quickly and decisively or make a swift escape.</p><p>Now, this worry was gone.</p><p>Next was his spirit sense.</p><p>Qin Sang had already achieved spirit body transformation; after this breakthrough, his spirit sense improved with his cultivation.</p><p>He anticipated that after breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage, his spirit sense would surely surpass that of ordinary Grand Cultivators. This significant change still surprised him.</p><p>"Continuing to cultivate the *Fire Seed Lotus* and refining the demonic fire, if all goes well, my spirit sense might surpass that of a Nascent Soul cultivator and rival a Divine Transformation cultivator!"</p><p>Qin Sang reached a conclusion that filled him with immense joy.</p><p>He had just broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage, his cultivation hadn't even stabilized, yet he dared to harbor such ambitions, coveting the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Even a unilateral breakthrough in spirit sense was astonishing.</p><p>The *Fire Seed Lotus* and the Nine Nether Demonic Fire—a top-tier divine ability and a rare spiritual fire—combined, would propel him to unimaginable heights!</p><p>Let's not forget the Soul-Nurturing Wood.</p><p>The benefits he received from the Soul-Nurturing Wood over time were immeasurable.</p><p>"If my spirit sense breaks through again and rivals that of a Divine Transformation cultivator, could I withstand the Heavenly Dao suppression of a Divine Transformation cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this question.</p><p>The greatest difference between Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation cultivation lies herein.</p><p>Qin Sang knew too little about the Divine Transformation stage to conjure an answer.</p><p>With this discovery, Qin Sang was eager to return to seclusion and focus on cultivating the *Fire Seed Lotus*, to see just how far he could go.</p><p>His previous plan was to, after breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage, dedicate some effort to body refinement, cultivating the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering*.</p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul stage, he had barely cultivated this technique.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Body Tempering* remained at the early fourth level, far behind.</p><p>The *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal* is a divine ability with considerable power and potential; however, limited by his physical body, it’s far inferior to Qin Sang's other abilities and is ineffective in combat.</p><p>Cultivating spirit, energy, and body, even without a future chance at Divine Transformation, allows one to cultivate all three to their peak, increasing the odds of a breakthrough.</p><p>"I need to change my plans…"</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his chin.</p><p>Divine Transformation wasn't imminent.</p><p>If his spirit sense could breakthrough, countless benefits would follow.  This rare opportunity should take precedence. Even without considering the elusive Divine Transformation cultivators, it would allow him to suppress those of his own realm.</p><p>The Central Plains were in turmoil.</p><p>Qin Sang had kept his avatar away from the conflict, for one reason—insufficient strength.</p><p>The accumulation of the super sects in the Central Plains is absolutely terrifying.  Furthermore, some sects have more than one Grand Cultivator, connected by intricate relationships; offending one brings a swarm.</p><p>Compared to them, Qin Sang was weak and alone. Only by becoming stronger would he be qualified to intervene in the affairs of the world.</p><p>Dismissing these thoughts, Qin Sang focused on other matters.</p><p>"Lu Ye, Old Devil Lu…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, then listed several more names, "Eight Scenic Spots, True Monarch Dan Yu, Ganlu Chan Monastery, Holy Venerable Hui Guang, the Ghost Mother, the Yao race, the Gu God Sect, the South Sea Immortal Palace…"</p><p>These names, along with sects like Bu Nian Mountain, sketched a rough outline of the power distribution in the Central Plains.</p><p>However, many pieces were missing, preventing Qin Sang from connecting them.  A heavy fog obscured everything.</p><p>Where did the Divine Transformation cultivators go?  What were the Gu God Sect and Lu Ye plotting?</p><p>After long contemplation,</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly chuckled.</p><p>Why was he thinking so much?</p><p>He had no ties in the Central Plains; he could come and go as he pleased.  As long as he remembered his goal, he could adapt to any situation.</p><p>Regarding Wu Wang Palace, Qin Sang not only forbade his physical manifestation from going, but he himself had no intention of joining the fray.</p><p>In his opinion, Wu Wang Palace was likely to ignite conflict in Central State, and the forces secretly and openly gathered from the Southern Archipelago would be astonishingly numerous.  Having just broken through to the late stage, he needed to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>Following Cheng Weizhi’s assessment, those individuals had already pinpointed the location of the Wu Wang Palace ruins. Going there now would likely be too late, so it was better to wait for further news.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang left his physical manifestation outside to maintain contact with Bu Nian Mountain and monitor the outcome of the Wu Wang Palace dispute. His physical body returned to his cave abode to resume his seclusion.</p><p>Besides cultivation, Qin Sang also needed to prepare for his fourth nine-day tribulation.  It was only his first tribulation; given his strength, he had little to worry about, but he couldn't be complacent.  Especially as the tribulation approached, the heavenly might's pressure intensified, affecting his ability to fight.</p><p>Unless something critical arose, Qin Sang planned to remain in seclusion until he had successfully passed the tribulation.</p><p>Returning to his cave, Qin Sang spent some time consolidating his cultivation before eagerly summoning the Yun You Sword.  A flash of light from his brow, and the Yun You Sword appeared before him.  Its body, like jade, possessed a breathtaking beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at it for a long time, murmuring, “Old friend, long time no see.” Bai had warned him that after containing Yun Youzi's spirit, he would be unable to use the sword for a long time.  He hadn't expected that even as a Grand Cultivator, he still saw no hope.</p><p>During his Nascent Soul mid-stage, Qin Sang had attempted to refine the Yun You Sword using the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique*, but his insufficient cultivation had led to repeated failures.  Now he decided to try again.</p><p>The Yun You Sword trembled slightly, gently falling into Qin Sang's palm.  He placed his palms together, entered a meditative state, and the entire *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* flowed through his mind.</p><p>A cultivator's lifebound treasure is deeply connected to their path, making it their most crucial possession. The *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* allowed for its gradual enhancement without needing to search for various treasures—only the cultivator's effort and time were required.  It could even elevate a treasure into a pseudo-spiritual treasure or even a spiritual treasure.</p><p>In this respect alone, the difficulty is much less than refining an ordinary spiritual treasure. Of course, this process is also extremely lengthy.</p><p>Recalling the entire technique, Qin Sang's consciousness connected with the Yun You Sword.  Part of his consciousness observed the changes in Yun Youzi's spirit while he began to operate the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique*.</p><p>Before him, beams of light appeared, countless runes flashed continuously, merging into the Yun You Sword, completely absorbed. The runes were extremely complex, requiring the simultaneous use of true energy and divine consciousness.  The further he progressed, the more strenuous it became. During his Nascent Soul mid-stage, the last part of the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* had been beyond his capabilities, forcing him to abandon the attempt each time.  Now, it was distinctly different.</p><p>‘Swish!’ The final dozen runes were completed in one go. A hazy glow appeared on the Yun You Sword’s surface.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, his face showing joy. Without hesitation, he stored the Yun You Sword within his primordial spirit and, using a secret technique, focused on refining it.</p><p>The *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* was extremely demanding.  Less than an hour later, Qin Sang felt exhausted. He awoke from his meditative state, slowly withdrawing his cultivation and sensing the Yun You Sword.</p><p>Cultivators and their lifebound treasures have a blood-like connection.  After refinement, it felt closer, but Yun Youzi's spirit showed no significant changes. At least, the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* didn’t harm the spirit.</p><p>Confirming this reassured Qin Sang.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang rested briefly, then summoned the Fire Lotus and the demonic fire. With his enhanced divine consciousness, refining the demonic fire was indeed faster than before.</p><p>…</p><p>While his physical body focused on refining the demonic fire, his manifestation finally received a message from Bu Nian Mountain.  Fu Han had personally delivered a summons, not just to him, but to all Nascent Soul forces under Bu Nian Mountain for a meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the invitation, looked at Fu Han, and asked, “I haven’t heard any news. I didn’t expect the Wu Wang Palace matter to have concluded already. When did Master Situ return from the East Sea?  Master Situ and Daoist Cheng Shenzi went together, they should have made considerable gains, right?”</p><p>It wouldn't be long before this news spread throughout Central State. Fu Han had no need to hide anything from Qin Sang.  He shook his head. “Master and Uncle returned empty-handed!  Anomalous phenomena did appear near the Southern Archipelago, confirming the existence of the Wu Wang Palace ruins. But before anyone could enter, the entrance vanished.”</p><p>“Oh?” Qin Sang was startled.  “Then what? They just gave up?”</p><p>Fu Han replied, “After the entrance disappeared, Master searched everywhere, finding nothing.  Actually, the anomaly lasted quite a while, but it was extremely dangerous, so Master observed from a distance. Unexpectedly, Zi Lei Zhenren, the Eight Views Pavilion master, disregarded the danger and ventured in, suffering severe injuries and failing to pass the outer barrier. It’s said that the Eight Views Pavilion and the Gan Lu Chan Monastery lost several Nascent Soul cultivators.”</p><p>After a pause, Fu Han added,  “Master said that the Wu Wang Palace ruins are extremely dangerous, even for Transformative God cultivators.”</p>
