<h1>Chapter 2090: Rout</h1><p>A suffocating white wave nearly swallowed them whole. Time seemed to freeze as Qin Li and Little Fox stiffened, unable to react.  Just then, the surrounding water droplets silently disintegrated, and all the pressure vanished.</p><p>The human and fox burst forth, like drowning victims finally gasping for air, reborn.</p><p>They hid behind Jian Yi, still shaken. Looking back, they saw the white wave had completely disappeared. Jian Yi hadn't even drawn his sword, dispelling it with his sword intent alone.</p><p>The Changyou Clan expert who had attacked earlier happened to glance over. Seeing this, he snorted coldly, a fierce glint flashing in his eyes. His lips moved slightly as he spoke with the clansmen beside him, then he left the battle and strode across the waves alone.</p><p>Qin Li and Little Fox froze, tension gripping them once more. This person's power was even greater than the previous enemies. Jian Yi, having just broken through to the Golden Core stage, was certainly no match for him.  They had intended to help Jian Yi, but instead, they had dragged him into an even more perilous situation.</p><p>“What do we do now?”</p><p>Little Fox paced anxiously.</p><p>“You go first.”</p><p>Jian Yi's words were as calm as ever.  Composed, he showed no sign of the fierce battle he had just endured.  Summoning his spirit sword, he flew forward, transmitting his voice, “Something's not right. The Changyou Clan might have a sinister plot. Quickly return to camp and report!”</p><p>Qin Li and Little Fox had felt it too, and Jian Yi’s words confirmed their suspicions.  Understanding the gravity of the situation, they knew they had to report back as soon as possible. This was no time for sentimentality, and their presence here wouldn't be of any help.</p><p>The human and fox hadn't flown far when they heard booming sounds behind them, waves of vast True Essence rippling outwards. Their hearts trembled, and they dared not delay.</p><p>When they flew back to the main camp, they found banners fluttering, countless streaks of light crisscrossing the sky, and beams of spiritual light forming a multicolored canopy.  A chilling atmosphere permeated the air.</p><p>The Storm Realm's chosen defensive position was a sea region dense with islands, stretching north and south. Over the years, the Storm Realm had poured countless resources into building an impregnable line of defense.  During the last war with the Changyou Clan, this line had stubbornly held back the enemy and remained unbroken.</p><p>The shimmering canopies were formed by numerous grand formations.  These screens of light stood above the islands, interconnected, stretching along the archipelago, boundless like a wall built in the void, reaching the heavens.</p><p>Below the shimmering barriers were guarded passages allowing entry and exit, heavily fortified and ready for battle.</p><p>Qin Li and Little Fox landed in front of one such passage. The guards' sharp gazes fixed on them, and they felt themselves locked onto by powerful auras capable of obliterating them in an instant.</p><p>“State your names!”</p><p>A guard shouted.</p><p>“I am Qin Li, a disciple of the Green Ram Sect, serving under General Hong…”</p><p>Qin Li dared not make any sudden movements, explaining loudly as he presented his identification token to the guard.</p><p>After confirming their identities, the guard opened the passage and allowed them in, but dispatched two guards to keep a close watch on them, escorting them to meet the garrison commander.</p><p>Suppressing their anxiety, they soon met the commander in a grand hall.  “We pay our respects to General Jin Ling.”</p><p>General Jin Ling looked up, his gaze sharp as a sword, seemingly able to pierce through their thoughts. “You are restless. What did you encounter outside?”</p><p>“We are here to report precisely that…”</p><p>At this moment, Little Fox's eloquence came into play, explaining the situation for Qin Li.</p><p>General Jin Ling hummed in acknowledgment. “We have already received intelligence about the Changyou Clan's movements. You are concerned for the greater good and have returned promptly to report. This will be recorded as a merit… Take them back to their camp.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The two guards bowed in response.</p><p>Little Fox was extremely anxious, exclaiming, “Jian Yi and the others are being besieged by Changyou Clan experts!  The situation is extremely dangerous! Please, General, send someone to rescue them immediately, otherwise…”</p><p>Unexpectedly, General Jin Ling remained indifferent, waving his hand.  A gentle force propelled them out of the hall.  The two guards stepped in front of Qin Li and Little Fox.  “Fellow Daoists, please come with us.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Little Fox shrieked, and Qin Li knelt, pleading.</p><p>The two guards’ faces darkened. “Do not cause a disturbance!  There are others assigned to rescue stranded Daoists!  The situation is critical, and every position is short-handed. We cannot arbitrarily deploy troops. Return to your camp quickly and await orders!”</p><p>“I won't go!  Our comrades are in danger, and to stand idly by is not what a general should do!” Little Fox yelled at the hall doors, her voice sharp.</p><p>“Insolent! You dare to defy your superiors? Don't blame us for being ruthless!”</p><p>The two guards were furious.  With a clang, two golden chains flew from their sleeves, shooting towards Little Fox.</p><p>Little Fox dodged nimbly between the chains, pointing at Qin Li and shouting, "How dare you hurt me! We are disciples of the Green Ram Sect! He is of the Qin bloodline, his great-uncle is Qin Hongyuan! We demand to see Great-Uncle!”</p><p>Qin Hongyuan was a renowned expert of the Green Ram Sect. The two guards hesitated.</p><p>At this moment, other guards arrived, alerted by the commotion.</p><p>A guard captain sneered, “This is the front line, not your Green Ram Sect!  Even if you are a direct disciple of the Sect Master, you must obey orders!  So what if he is of the Qin bloodline? You dare to cause trouble in the General’s residence?  Let’s see if Senior Qin will acknowledge you!  Seize them!”</p><p>All the guards surged forward. Qin Li and Little Fox were no match, quickly bound tightly.  No matter how anxious they were, it was to no avail.</p><p>Their identities did offer some protection. The guard captain, instead of punishing them, personally escorted them back to camp and handed them over to General Hong.</p><p>After the guards left, Qin Li and Little Fox pleaded incessantly.  General Hong, also worried about Jian Yi and the others, promised to intercede on their behalf. However, before receiving orders, they absolutely could not leave the camp.</p><p>They tried everything they could, but their pleas were like stones sinking into the sea, without any response.  The more time passed, the dimmer their hopes became.</p><p>Just as they were losing heart, they finally received orders, but not to rescue Jian Yi. They were to retreat!</p><p>Under different circumstances, being the first to retreat and escape danger would have filled them with joy. Now, however, a burning resentment filled them, a desire to slay more Changyou clansmen and avenge Jian Yi.</p><p>What puzzled them most was why they were retreating instead of holding the line, even if they couldn't counterattack.</p><p>On the battlefield, everyone had a role. Even those with low cultivation could hold a node in the grand formation.  The defensive line could only be stabilized with countless cultivators working together to power the formations.</p><p>“Why are we retreating? Where are we going?”</p><p>Little Fox and Qin Li’s questions went unanswered.  Despite their unwillingness, they could only follow General Hong in the retreat.</p><p>‘Crash…’</p><p>The tide surged.</p><p>From their flying vessel, they saw streams of light from other vessels on both sides. Ship after ship, laden with cultivators, were withdrawing from the front lines, creating an impression of a rout.</p><p>“Why retreat? Why retreat now…”</p><p>Qin Li murmured.  Little Fox was equally baffled.</p><p>They hadn't even engaged in a direct confrontation, or perhaps battles had begun elsewhere, but the flames of war hadn’t reached them yet.  To flee without a fight was to surrender their carefully constructed defenses.</p><p>Why would the higher-ups make such a foolish decision?  Did they believe the line couldn't be held, unwilling to make futile sacrifices?</p><p>Little Fox shuddered at this possibility.</p><p>The first line of defense, also the strongest, had collapsed without a fight.  Could the subsequent lines hold?</p><p>If the situation continued to deteriorate, would the enemy invade the heartland of the North Sea, even occupying its four borders?</p><p>Terror gripped Little Fox.  It had never envisioned such a scenario. How could such a strong defensive line collapse?  Yet the situation seemed to be sliding towards the outcome it least wanted to see.</p><p>Even if its fears were realized, it could do nothing. They were merely specks of dust swept along by the raging river, powerless to change course or escape.  Their only hope was timely reinforcements from the Central State.</p><p>Their vessel carried them to the second line of defense.  A series of orders followed, and they began frantic preparations, activating the formations in this area. The heavy workload left them no time to dwell on their worries, or perhaps they deliberately avoided doing so.</p><p>Battle reports from the front line arrived frequently. Qin Li and Little Fox weren't privy to their contents, but they could gauge the grim situation from the increasingly solemn expressions of the generals.</p><p>One day, their greatest fear came to pass. The front line completely collapsed, and years of effort by the North Sea sects were ruined.</p><p>Waves of defeated troops retreated to their position, strengthening their defenses, but Qin Li and Little Fox felt increasingly lost.</p><p>On the battlefield, whether one hailed from the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea or the Green Ram Sect was irrelevant. The Green Ram Sect never showed favoritism to its disciples. They were no different from rogue cultivators, their survival depending entirely on luck.</p><p>Having lost the protection of their sect, they realized how insignificant they were.  Without powerful strength to protect themselves, they were all but ants.</p><p>The second line of defense was far less complete than the first, divided into several battlefields, each fighting its own war.</p><p>They were fortunate.  Their attackers weren't the main force of the Changyou Clan, but the experience gave Qin Li and Little Fox a taste of the horrors of war.</p><p>…</p><p>Demon Sea.</p><p>Between the Demon Sea and the Eastern Sea of the Central State lay a vast expanse of ocean.  Ordinary islands had long been destroyed by storms, leaving almost no place to land, only a few aquatic demon races dwelling within.</p><p>These demon races had no heritage, having stumbled upon the path of cultivation by chance. They were disorganized and posed no real threat.  Moreover, the Changyou Clan periodically dispatched troops to cleanse the area, turning it into a barren, dead sea.</p><p>The sea was vast, and the Changyou Clan couldn't monitor every corner.</p><p>In a region near the Demon Sea, far from the Changyou Clan's eyes and ears, an army of demons had stealthily assembled.</p><p>These demon cultivators were disciplined, hidden deep beneath the waves.  Giant clam shells, the size of houses, served as their vessels. The interior of each shell provided ample space, creating a dry area where non-aquatic demon cultivators could cultivate undisturbed, also concealing their demonic auras.</p><p>Besides the clam shells, there were enormous conches and other bizarre artifacts, each concealing a squad of demon cultivators, poised to strike.</p><p>They were arranged in neat rows on the seabed, seemingly having been there for a long time. Some were covered in moss and seaweed, their original forms obscured, resembling underwater hills.</p><p>On the periphery, Flood Dragons and Golden Toads patrolled, their auras similarly suppressed. Everything was silent.</p><p>The seawater here was darker than elsewhere, like fog on land, an effect of a concealing formation.</p><p>This was the army dispatched by the demon races of the Demon Sea.</p><p>After deciding to reclaim the Demon Sea, the Flood Dragon King and the Golden Toad King had secretly contacted the various clans and begun preparations.</p><p>The Dragon, Phoenix, and Golden Toad clans had made the decision together.  Even those clans who found the Central State agreeable dared not object.  Reclaiming their ancestral land was a righteous cause.</p><p>Thus, each clan began secretly mobilizing their experts, sending them in batches to the North Sea, concealing their movements.</p><p>With the Changyou Clan showing no activity in the Western Wastelands and the front lines relaxed, they only needed to leave a portion of their forces to guard the Western Wastelands, enabling them to deceive everyone.</p><p>Neither the human race, the witch race, nor the Changyou Clan seemed to have noticed their actions, and everything proceeded smoothly.</p><p>However, these preparations weren't enough. The Changyou Clan possessed innate water manipulation abilities. If any Changyou Clan experts happened to pass by, the hidden forces wouldn't escape their detection.</p><p>From the beginning of the plan, the Golden Toad King, along with the kings of several powerful clans, had personally overseen the operation, resolving several crises.</p><p>Now, they could finally rest easy. The Flood Dragon King had arrived, and he had broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>Unless the Changyou Clan Chief personally intervened, they were capable of handling any unexpected situations.  Everything was ready, they only needed a favorable wind.</p><p>“That scoundrel Long Jing is said to have been in seclusion for thirty years. I wonder if he has broken through.”</p><p>On an island, several figures stood beneath the trees, gazing towards the Demon Sea.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King and the Golden Toad King stood at the front, followed by the kings of several powerful clans.  The current Phoenix King was also among them. The Phoenix Clan remained the third largest clan in the Demon Sea, but the Phoenix King's cultivation was far inferior to the two demon kings, preventing her from being on equal footing with them.</p><p>It was the Golden Toad King who spoke.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King said indifferently, “Perhaps he has already broken through and is using this as an excuse to observe. Even if Long Jing breaks through, he won't choose a side. Our own strength is sufficient to reclaim our ancestral land. Once we succeed, he will naturally come to us.”</p><p>The Golden Toad King chuckled. “We haven’t heard of any Changyou Clan elders breaking through recently. Even if new experts emerge, they will certainly be sent to the North Sea first. It’s best if they remain entangled with the North Sea, with no time to concern themselves with us. As long as we regain control of our ancestral land, we can hold it under your leadership.  By then, the matter will be settled, and the human race will have to accept it!”</p><p>The Phoenix King wasn't so optimistic, her delicate brows furrowed.  “What if they become enraged and take it out on our clansmen in the Central State? You entrusted the army guarding the Western Wastelands to Elder Yuan Zhu. He is from the faction closest to the human race and seems to have a close relationship with the Green Ram Sect Master. What if he acts on his own and leads his troops to aid them…?”</p><p>The Flood Dragon King waved his hand, interrupting her. “I have anticipated Elder Yuan Zhu’s actions. I deliberately sent him and those close to the human race away to prevent any leaks.  The Changyou Clan will definitely pressure the Western Wastelands while attacking the North Sea. Even if he wants to reinforce the North Sea, he won’t be able to take many troops with him, and it won’t change the overall situation!”</p><p>“This will be the starting point of our clan’s resurgence!  We will settle old scores with them in due time!” The Golden Toad King was filled with ambition, practically brimming with impatience.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King nodded slightly, then his expression shifted subtly. He closed his eyes, sensing for a long moment, before suddenly bursting into laughter. “The Changyou Clan has made their move!”</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>The other demons erupted in jubilation.</p>
