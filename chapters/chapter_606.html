<h1>Chapter 599: Immortal Flame</h1><p>After untold millennia, the sword energy persists.</p><p>Since entering the Violet Citadel, Qin Sang had witnessed countless wonders beyond imagination, experiencing shock after shock until he became numb.</p><p>This sword scar, cleaving a mountain and shattering countless ancient halls, served as a warning to posterity: do not trespass.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the sword scar, when suddenly a faint 'crack' reached his ears. He quickly raised his wrist to see a thin crack appearing on a scale of his dragon-shaped wooden bracelet.</p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. The bracelet could barely suppress the mark any longer.</p><p>He had long promised to heal Yun Youzi, and for this, Yun Youzi had spared no effort to help him obtain the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit. Having already received the benefits, he couldn't go back on his word.</p><p>Fortunately, there was only one crack on the bracelet; it should last a while longer.</p><p>Because Feitian Yecha's transformation was incomplete, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had agreed to conserve the Corpse Pill's energy for emergencies. Now, they couldn't wait any longer.</p><p>Unsealing the Corpse Pill, Qin Sang said in a deep voice, "Senior, lead the way."</p><p>Without delay, the two began to ascend the mountain.</p><p>Upon entering the mountain mist, the peaks and ancient halls vanished from sight, replaced by a massive illusionary formation.</p><p>Yun Youzi took out a compass-like object and gave another to Qin Sang, instructing him on its use.</p><p>This artifact seemed specifically designed for this formation. Once activated with spiritual energy, a golden needle appeared in the center of the compass, guiding their way.</p><p>The golden needle pointed along a narrow, winding, and perilous mountain path.</p><p>Fortunately, their journey was smooth, encountering no danger, and they quickly reached the summit.</p><p>They stood before a dried-up small lake, facing ruins. Endless mist lingered in the distance, shrouding the entire mountain in the illusionary formation.</p><p>Yun Youzi stepped forward, adjusting the compass, and pointed towards the opposite shore of the lake, saying in a deep voice, "Go there!"</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, stepping directly into the small lake and walking straight ahead.</p><p>Passing over the ruins of several collapsed ancient halls, Qin Sang frequently swept his divine sense through the debris, but found nothing.</p><p>However, he noticed that the arrangement of these ancient halls seemed to hold a deeper meaning, serving a specific purpose.</p><p>"As far as I know, these ancient halls might have been alchemists' chambers!"</p><p>While confirming their direction with the compass, Yun Youzi explained to Qin Sang, pointing to the channels on the floor of the ruined halls, "These might be fire channels, working in conjunction with spirit formations to draw flames from elsewhere to aid in alchemy."</p><p>Qin Sang had long found these channels strange, never imagining they were fire channels. He asked doubtfully, "The Violet Citadel is so mysterious, and those who lived here, even if not all powerful, must have possessed considerable cultivation. Foundation Establishment cultivators can manipulate alchemical flames for refining, with power surpassing earthly fire. What kind of flame were they channeling, distributing it to so many people, and stronger than spiritual fire generated from their own true essence?"</p><p>Qin Sang had some knowledge of refining tools, and alchemy shared some similarities.</p><p>Countless ancient halls filled the mountain. If they were all alchemy chambers, and so many alchemists refined simultaneously, what kind of immortal flame could sustain them?</p><p>Yun Youzi said,</p><p>"Alchemical flame isn't necessarily stronger than all earthly fire. Brother, do you remember the mountain within a mountain of the Void Spirit Sect? There was a mutated earthly fire within, far surpassing ordinary earthly fire, which served as the foundation of the Void Spirit Sect.</p><p>"Countless unique spiritual flames exist in the cultivation world, some called immortal flames, far more powerful than the Nascent Soul flames of Nascent Soul cultivators. Cultivators refine these flames for alchemy and refining tools, which can significantly improve efficiency and success rates.</p><p>"Moreover, these ancient halls must have powerful restrictions to control the flames, so the refiners don't need to be distracted.</p><p>"As for what kind of flame it is, Brother Qin will soon find out..."</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of these things Yun Youzi mentioned.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire sealed within the Ten Yama Banners was one such unique spiritual flame.</p><p>Qin Sang had long coveted the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, wanting to use it for refining.</p><p>With only one Ten Yama Banner, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's assistance was limited. However, Qin Sang had learned the method to deploy three banners in formation, greatly increasing the demonic fire's power.</p><p>Whether it would be useful depended on him reaching Foundation Establishment and freely manipulating the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>Hearing that the divine fire in the Immortal Palace was still burning, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel anticipation.</p><p>This fire must be extraordinary. Could it be the legendary Great Sun Fire, or the Sun Essence Fire?</p><p>If it truly was a rare immortal flame, could he borrow Kui Yin's method of refining the Ten Yama Banners and attempt to subdue it after his cultivation improved?</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang became even more eager, hurrying forward.</p><p>The further they went, the more thoroughly destroyed the ancient halls became. Qin Sang silently calculated their position, realizing Yun Youzi was leading him towards the sword scar. No wonder a terrifying pressure emanated from ahead.</p><p>Oppressed by the sword energy, their speed was forced to slow. They dared not fly, instead trudging forward step by step, getting closer and closer to the sword scar.</p><p>Qin Sang was drenched in sweat. Not only did he have to resist the sword energy's pressure, but he also had to assist Yun Youzi. The true essence within the Corpse Pill was rapidly depleting.</p><p>But now, he couldn't afford to be distracted.  On their way up the mountain, a second crack appeared on the wooden bracelet.</p><p>Focusing all his energy on activating the Corpse Pill for protection, Qin Sang finally heard Yun Youzi say,</p><p>"We're here."</p><p>Qin Sang widened his eyes and looked ahead, seeing a steep cliff face with a massive stone hall built upon it, similar in style to those below, but much grander and more magnificent.</p><p>Surprisingly, this stone hall hadn't collapsed.</p><p>However, it wasn't entirely unscathed.</p><p>The sword scar ran directly through the center of the stone hall, splitting it in two. The severed edges were incredibly smooth, cleanly bisected, with the portions of the hall on either side of the sword scar remaining intact.</p><p>Time had passed, and wind and sand had eroded the stone.</p><p>Now, the hall had lost its former glory, pitted and weathered, revealing its age.</p><p>The main doors of the stone hall were wide open, offering an unobstructed view of the empty interior.</p><p>The two endured the pressure, shuffling into the hall step by step. Qin Sang looked around curiously but saw no sign of spiritual fire, nor sensed any unusual fluctuations.</p><p>Yun Youzi glanced around, pondered for a moment, then walked to a specific stone tile within the hall. He squatted down and pressed his hand against it. A strange light shimmered, and a rumbling sound echoed from deep below.</p><p>Yun Youzi said to Qin Sang, "The fire channels sealing the spiritual fire are actually underground, just like the Spirit Gathering Platform in the Spirit Gathering Hall, hidden incredibly deep, imperceptible from the outside. I only learned of this by chance..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the floor of the stone hall suddenly cracked open, revealing a hidden passage leading straight down.</p><p>As the passage opened, a wave of intense heat surged out, drastically increasing the temperature within the hall. A deep red glow emerged from the depths of the passage.</p><p>Yun Youzi's expression relaxed, and he said with relief, "Good! The spiritual fire is still here, undiscovered!"</p>
