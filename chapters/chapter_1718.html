<h1>Chapter 1709: Gathering Treasures from the World</h1><p>Seven Western States.</p><p>Zhenzhou.</p><p>This state borders the Western Desert in the west.  The border is a vast expanse of mountains and valleys, shielding it from the encroaching sands.</p><p>The mountains are lush and green, vibrant with spiritual energy, a stark contrast to the endless yellow desert.  Almost every mountain here has caves.</p><p>Countless large and small sects and hermits cultivate here, earning the region the title of "Thousand Mountains, Thousand Sects."</p><p>The Xuance Sect is one such sect.</p><p>Though not a single lineage, the sect numbers only thirty-odd people.  They strictly select their disciples, valuing quality over quantity.</p><p>While smaller than many renowned sects, Xuance Sect holds considerable prestige, and its Sect Master, Mingce, enjoys high respect in the area.</p><p>Beneath a waterfall.</p><p>In a mountain pavilion.</p><p>Mingce felt the intense gaze of the Daoist in front of him and frowned deeply.  "Daoist, how did you learn that our sect possesses a Longevity Dendrobium?"</p><p>"Three hundred years ago, a Longevity Dendrobium was discovered in an oasis in the Western Desert, causing a scramble for it, but its final whereabouts remain unknown.  Coincidentally, I discovered that you were near that oasis at the time, and you were seen in a nearby market town…"</p><p>The Daoist across from him calmly explained, making no secret of his investigation into Mingce's movements.</p><p>The Daoist was none other than Qin Sang's incarnation!</p><p>The Mingyue Guards, scattered throughout the cultivation world, had been gathering information on various treasures, and it was time to close the net.</p><p>The Longevity Dendrobium was one such treasure.  It could be used to refine a pill for the *Panhu True Scripture*, increasing the cultivation of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.  However, this spirit herb also offered significant benefits to cultivators, making it difficult to persuade Mingce to part with it.</p><p>The Mingyue Guards had tirelessly collected most of the treasures on the list. The remaining ones either had no leads or were difficult to obtain, necessitating Qin Sang's personal intervention.</p><p>"The Longevity Dendrobium is of great use to me.  As long as you're willing to part with it, I will do everything in my power to satisfy you."</p><p>The incarnation's tone held immense confidence.</p><p>This confidence stemmed from overwhelming power!</p><p>Regardless of Qin Sang's true form, even his incarnation alone was nearly invincible in the world.  Only two Nascent Soul cultivators could surpass him.</p><p>Considering his true form, he no longer feared Nascent Soul cultivators as he once had.</p><p>After only fifty years of dedicated cultivation, Qin Sang's true form had reached the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>Considering the timeline, it hadn't been long since Qin Sang broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage.  The Wuxiang Immortal Sect was opened by Zhu Wu Dao more than eighty years after his breakthrough.</p><p>However, cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* consumed most of his time.  He truly began focused cultivation seventy years ago, after refining the demonic fire.</p><p>He reached the peak in just seventy years, even with distractions for the first twenty!</p><p>Such an astonishing cultivation speed at the late Nascent Soul stage was exceedingly rare, even among the renowned sects of the Central Plains.</p><p>The wordless jade tablet's Daoist rhyme and the Buddha bone relic were instrumental.  Even when encountering bottlenecks, Qin Sang could always break through after a period of patient contemplation.</p><p>The *Yuanshen Sword Cultivation Chapter*, killing talismans, and the Cleansing Pool enhanced his talent.  Coupled with the Four Saints Gathering Spirit Array, Qin Sang's cultivation progressed by leaps and bounds.</p><p>While still wary of the two Nascent Soul cultivators, Qin Sang now had the confidence to contend with even the Qinghu Saint King, should the latter break their agreement and attack, relying on the Luye Grand Array.</p><p>With this confidence, the incarnation no longer needed to hide in the Ganlu Chan Monastery.  This appearance was to gather treasures from the entire world!</p><p>"Daoist, you have quite the ambition!"</p><p>Mingce looked deeply at the incarnation.</p><p>Various signs indicated that the Qingfeng Daoist had a close relationship with the Ganlu Chan Monastery, and was a peak cultivator in this world, possessing the strength to make such a promise.</p><p>Conversely, Mingce had to consider the consequences of angering him.</p><p>The incarnation smiled in response.</p><p>Mingce fell silent, sighing softly.  "The Longevity Dendrobium was being prepared for my next breakthrough. Since the Daoist desires it, although I am reluctant, I am willing to grant your wish…"</p><p>The incarnation showed no delight at the quick agreement, knowing there was more to come.</p><p>As expected, Mingce changed his tone.  "However, I have a small request…"</p><p>After a pause, Mingce said gravely, "If the Daoist would be so kind as to save the life of my beloved disciple, I will immediately present you with the treasure!"</p><p>The incarnation was slightly surprised.  "Has your disciple offended some powerful person?"</p><p>"No, my disciple, while mischievous, is well-behaved."</p><p>Mingce shook his head, flicking his finger towards the mountaintop to send a decree summoning a disciple, then explained to the incarnation, "My disciple, Yu Zhensheng, was intelligent from a young age, and I had high hopes for him to carry on my legacy and revitalize the sect.  He did not disappoint, and has reached the late Golden Core stage, only a step away from Nascent Soul. Unfortunately, at the critical moment of his breakthrough, we discovered that besides the usual eight extraordinary meridians, he possesses an additional hidden meridian!"</p><p>"A hidden meridian?"</p><p>The incarnation was astonished, searching through his records and finding information about hidden meridians.</p><p>A special constitution, sometimes called an "hidden meridian," can be either easily opened or remain undiscovered until death.  Whether it's beneficial or harmful depends on its location.</p><p>Some hidden meridians, when opened, grant cultivators unique talents and significantly enhance the effectiveness of specific cultivation techniques.</p><p>Judging by Master Mingce's tone, Yu Zhensheng's case is different.</p><p>"I've consulted countless texts," Master Mingce explained, "and my disciple's hidden meridian poses no harm.  For others, forcibly opening it would almost certainly lead to enviable opportunities. However, our sect's techniques are unique. Forcibly opening the meridian risks my disciple's life, with the danger increasing with his cultivation level. If left untreated, his potential will be severely limited..."</p><p>A figure, handsome and imposing, swiftly descended from the mountaintop and stood beside the stone pavilion.</p><p>Following his master's guidance, Yu Zhensheng performed a formal bow of gratitude to the incarnation.</p><p>"Your words suggest you've found a solution?" the incarnation asked, sensing his condition.</p><p>Yu Zhensheng trembled slightly, suppressing his instincts as the incarnation investigated, a flicker of hope in his eyes.</p><p>"I've acquired a meridian-opening technique that can save my disciple. However, it requires protection. Someone must expend their essence to safeguard him during critical moments; ideally, a late-stage Yuan Ying cultivator.  Even with my intervention, the success rate is only fifty percent..."</p><p>Master Mingce glanced at the incarnation. He had initially planned to handle it himself, but lacked the resources to attract a powerful cultivator.  </p><p>Expenditure of essence requires prolonged cultivation to replenish, and great cultivators are focused on achieving the Divine Transformation stage, their time incredibly valuable.  A failed attempt would cost Yu Zhensheng's life and endanger the protector.  Who would risk saving a stranger?</p><p>After examining the meridian-opening technique, the incarnation pondered briefly before agreeing.  "Have your disciple follow the technique's instructions. Once I've dealt with other matters, I will safeguard him!  Prepare the *Changsheng Shihu*!"</p><p>With a slight bow, the incarnation departed.</p><p>"Master, he…"</p><p>Deeply concerned about his life, Yu Zhensheng worried about the ambiguous assurance.</p><p>Master Mingce, watching the incarnation leave, said with relief, "Don't worry, Daoist Qingfeng is a remarkable person and will keep his word."</p><p>...</p><p>Ningzhou, Central Plains.</p><p>Yin Yan Sect.</p><p>After leaving the Xuance Manor, the incarnation appeared before the Yin Yan Sect.  The gates swung open immediately, disciples lining up respectfully to greet the incarnation with elaborate courtesy.</p><p>The Sect Master and several elders emerged to welcome him.</p><p>"The arrival of Daoist Qingfeng graces our humble sect…"</p><p>After pleasantries, the incarnation was led into the main hall, offered fine tea and wine.</p><p>The Yin Yan Sect Master, an elderly, smooth-talking man, showered him with compliments but avoided mentioning the purpose of his visit.  The incarnation's attempts at initiating conversation were skillfully deflected.</p><p>Finally, the incarnation cut to the chase.  "Do you still possess the Yan Zhen Precious Gold?"</p><p>The Yan Zhen Precious Gold is a vital component for the Ice and Fire Order.</p><p>The Sect Master's eyes flickered.  He stroked his beard, feigning difficulty. "Well… as I told Daoist Qingfeng before, it was meant as a gift for Elder Fan of the Tian Hao Tower for his thousandth birthday celebration.  We can hardly…"</p><p>The Yin Yan Sect, being a subordinate of the Tian Hao Tower, was unafraid of the incarnation’s power.</p><p>Before he could finish, a fiery glow appeared in the incarnation's palm.  It was a crimson light tinged with dark green, revealing four folding screens. Each screen depicted a simple flame, seemingly burning perpetually.</p><p>The Sect Master nearly pulled his beard out, exclaiming, "This is…"</p><p>"I hear you've been wanting to refine a Fire Cloud Smoke Screen. Assess these flames. Do they meet your requirements?"</p><p>With a gentle tremor of his hand, the miniature screens floated towards the Sect Master.</p><p>The quality of a Fire Cloud Smoke Screen is determined not by the screens themselves but by the four spiritual flames within.  Aiming to please, the incarnation had tasked the Moon Guard with finding the crafting method.  He then personally crafted it using the ancestral fire from a fire lotus instead of the Nine Netherworld Devil Fire, leaving the Sect Master speechless.</p><p>An hour later, the Yin Yan Sect Master beaming, saw the incarnation off, seemingly reluctant to let him go.</p><p>...</p><p>The sky was overcast.  The rolling hills appeared shrouded in a gray mist. A subtle gray haze permeated the land, coloring the rocks a monotonous gray.  No green was visible, as if all life had been extinguished.</p><p>"Ahead lies the heart of the Grey Mountain Wilderness.  If you, Daoist Master, can venture deep within and find your master's remains, I'll only ask for a jade slip.  Everything else will be yours, and my junior sister will immediately deliver the Rootless Stone!"</p><p>Two figures flew at a leisurely pace. The speaker, a young man in black robes, deliberately kept half a step behind, his demeanor deferential.</p><p>The other was Huasheng, his eyes scanning the depths of the Grey Mountain Wilderness.</p><p>The Rootless Stone was a secondary material for the Ice and Fire Order, but Huasheng's true goal wasn't the stone, but an item among his master's belongings.</p><p>The young man in black robes was no ordinary person. His master, Gui Tuo, was infamous for his treachery against the Futian Valley.</p><p>Their current location was the southernmost part of the Western Seven States, bordering the Man State. The fact that this Grey Mountain area was called a "wilderness" spoke volumes about its danger.</p><p>In the distance, a hazy grey expanse obscured the view.</p><p>Legend claimed the wilderness teemed with ferocious and malevolent creatures; countless Yuan Ying masters had perished there. Searching for a single corpse was akin to finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Without pausing, after a brief discussion, the two entered the wilderness.</p><p>Huasheng summoned the Three Corpses Death Banner, and a demonic spirit coalesced.</p><p>Seeing the demonic spirit formed from Su Zinan, the young man in black robes was dumbfounded. The rumors were true. His gaze toward Huasheng was filled with awe and fear.</p><p>With the demonic spirit leading the way, they pressed onward.  Whirlwinds of grey mist howled, and Yin wolves, demonic apes, and other malevolent creatures materialized, only to be swiftly dispatched by the spirit.</p><p>After a long killing spree, the grey mist suddenly thinned, and the malevolent creatures vanished without a trace.</p><p>Huasheng instantly knew someone was manipulating things from behind; the legendary master of the Grey Mountain, no doubt.  Seeing the overwhelming power of the opponent, he adopted a stance of unconcerned defiance.</p><p>"Serves it right!"</p><p>Huasheng sneered, recalling the demonic spirit to his side. They searched the Grey Mountain Wilderness thoroughly, unimpeded, no creature daring to appear before them.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>They found a cave in a valley within the wilderness.</p><p>Inside the cave lay only a skeleton.  The young man in black robes identified it as his master's, bearing evidence of fatal injuries.</p><p>Since the master of the Grey Mountain was so cooperative, Huasheng didn't cause trouble. After retrieving the master's belongings, they departed.</p><p>Only after Huasheng's departure did a sigh of relief emanate from a hidden cavern somewhere in the mountain.</p><p>...</p><p>East Sea.</p><p>Water Mirror Seven Islands.</p><p>Seven offshore islands, each home to a sect. All seven sects were skilled in refining artifacts, each specializing in different areas. While not powerful individually, their unity gave them influence, freeing them from the control of the Qiongying Sect.</p><p>Huasheng's visit to the Water Mirror Seven Islands wasn't to commission artifacts, but to request access to their treasuries and acquire materials.</p><p>"Our seven sects have decided: if you will become a guest elder of the Water Mirror Seven Islands, these two treasures are yours, no charge!"  The sect master of the Luojing Sect, Qin Sang's host, a shrewd-looking man, declared.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Huasheng hesitated.</p><p>It wasn't a question of his qualifications as a guest elder, but the Water Mirror Seven Islands' location in the East Sea, under the threat of the Qinghu Saint King, made it inconvenient.</p><p>Their meeting took place at a Water Mirror Seven Islands outpost near the mouth of the Fujiang River.</p><p>"Daoist Master, please don't worry, we won't ask you to confront powerful enemies.  We only ask you to speak favorably on our behalf to the Three Teach Alliance, to help secure better conditions," the Luojing Sect master quickly explained.</p><p>"The Water Mirror Seven Islands wish to join the Three Teach Alliance?"</p><p>Huasheng was surprised, but after some thought, agreed.</p><p>The so-called Three Teach Alliance was a pact forged thirty years ago between the Ganlu Zen Monastery, the Eight Scenic Views Sect, and the Tianhao Tower—an event that sent shockwaves throughout the cultivation world.</p><p>No one would have imagined that Daoists, Buddhists, and demon cultivators, traditionally at odds, could set aside their differences and unite.</p><p>The union of the three sects had the cultivation world living in fear!</p><p>"Three Teach Alliance" was a name given by outsiders, but it was fitting and became widely accepted.</p><p>It was clear to everyone that the alliance was spearheaded by the Hui Guang Saint, but the reasons remained unknown.  Hui Guang Saint only appeared once at the alliance's formation thirty years ago, since then remaining in seclusion.</p><p>While the Xie family also joined the Three Teach Alliance, Qin Sang was focused on cultivation and paid little attention to the alliance's details.</p><p>Huasheng, having earned merit for slaying demons, could easily put in a good word for the Water Mirror Seven Islands.</p><p>...</p><p>As Huasheng traveled, treasures accumulated, and materials gradually became complete.</p><p>His true body remained in Luye, expected to resume the practice of  "Celestial Demon Transformation".</p><p>However, when sensing the Wusheng Demon Seal within him, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable stirring.</p>
