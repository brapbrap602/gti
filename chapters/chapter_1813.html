<h1>Chapter 1804: The Vajra Stupa</h1><p>Qin Sang suspected that the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal* might be the Vajra Wheel Seal, one of the Nine Great Bright Seals, but he wasn't certain.  The origins of the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal* were untraceable; it was impossible to deduce anything from that angle. Only by cultivating this seal to its peak could he possibly know.  However, the fact that the Western Buddhist region possesses half a Lion Seal suggests that the Storm Realm does have a legacy of the Nine Great Bright Seals.</p><p>"I wonder about the origins of the Nine Great Bright Seals.  Why, Venerable One, have you informed me of this?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked cautiously, his expression unchanged.</p><p>"The Nine Great Bright Seals are supreme divine abilities of the Vajra lineage within our Buddhist order. There are nine types of Buddha Seals, each possessing unique wonders and tremendous power. Unfortunately, they are all lost to time, and now only fragments remain in ancient texts…"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Buddhism considers gold the most durable substance in the world. "Vajra" signifies indestructibility. Buddhist scriptures also mention Vajra Dharma protectors, divine beings who safeguard Buddhist teachings and hold high status.  Based on the two known Nine Great Bright Seals, the Vajra lineage should be the Buddhist order's body-refining lineage.</p><p>Qin Sang deeply understood the power of the Lion Seal, yet he only possessed half of it.  Considering the other eight seals are on par with the Lion Seal, the Nine Great Bright Seals must be incredibly powerful divine abilities of the Buddhist order; Venerable Zhenru's words weren't an exaggeration.</p><p>At this moment, Venerable Zhenru fell silent for a moment, then said: "My purpose in coming here involves a secret of our temple. I hope, sir, that you will make a karmic vow never to reveal it."</p><p>A flicker of curiosity crossed Qin Sang's eyes. He had no objections.</p><p>After the vow was made, Venerable Zhenru chanted a Buddhist invocation. "Our temple is a descendant of the Vajra lineage, with the *Three Grades Vajra Scripture* as its fundamental practice…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded as he listened. What Venerable Zhenru was saying wasn't a secret; he'd heard rumors about Jingtai Temple when he was inquiring about it.  Jingtai Temple occasionally produces a Nascent Soul-level monk and is considered a relatively powerful force in the Jushan region.</p><p>Because Buddhism doesn't have the concept of [redacted - unclear original text, possibly referring to a specific Daoist practice], Jingtai Temple must also follow Daoist [redacted - same as above] practices, the construction of the Dragon Tiger Altar. With the inherent incompatibility between Buddhism and Daoism, and the limitations of the Dragon Tiger Altar, it's understandable that this would affect the monks' cultivation.  Jingtai Temple has never produced a saint-monk capable of turning the tide and reviving Buddhism.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru paused, then said in a low voice: "Within our temple, we also treasure a Vajra Stupa! The origins of this stupa are unknown. It's very likely a treasure of the Vajra lineage, but it's heavily sealed, and our temple hasn't yet been able to break the seals."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang understood. "Venerable One, do you believe my Buddha Seal can open the seal?"</p><p>"If the Vajra Stupa is a sacred tower of the Vajra lineage, and as one of the Nine Great Bright Seals, the Vajra Wheel Seal, even if it isn't the key to opening the seal, it should still have a miraculous effect in breaking the seal," Venerable Zhenru said confidently.</p><p>His gaze toward Qin Sang was fervent.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the other party wasn't expecting him, but the location of the Vajra Wheel Seal behind him.  Venerable Zhenru believed that the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal* was created in imitation of the Vajra Wheel Seal. If the origins of the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal* could be found, there might be a chance to find clues to the Vajra Wheel Seal. Even if the Vajra Stupa couldn't be opened, obtaining one of the Nine Great Bright Seals would be enough to cause wild joy.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. His following answer caused Venerable Zhenru to show a look of disappointment. "To be frank, this Buddha Seal is called the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal*. I obtained it hundreds of years ago. At that time, I didn't know its origins were so great, and I didn't pay much attention to it.  Today, it's absolutely impossible to trace its origins. Venerable One, if you don't believe me, I can make a vow.  The Vajra Wheel Seal, such a divine ability, is enough to be the foundation of one's life. Venerable One, if you are willing to help me find the seal, I would be grateful. This is mutually beneficial, and I have no reason to hide anything."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't seem to be lying, the disappointment in Venerable Zhenru's eyes deepened. He murmured, "In that case… I only hope that the *Seven Masters' Buddha Seal* can gain the Vajra Stupa's recognition."</p><p>Qin Sang still had many questions.  "I dare ask, what secrets are within the Stupa? Your temple has produced many eminent monks. Shouldn't you have a way to deal with the seals?"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru slowly shook his head.</p><p>The secrets of the Vajra Stupa have not yet been deciphered.  They don't even know what treasures are contained within.</p><p>But one thing is certain: this stupa is very important to them. Once opened, Jingtai Temple might rise to great heights because of it.</p><p>"A great inheritance of the Vajra lineage, or a Buddhist treasure, or even the Vajra Stupa itself being a supreme treasure—all are possibilities."</p><p>The temple's lineage of masters had repeatedly attempted to break the seal, but none had succeeded.  They had also sought help from trusted friends outside the temple, but those not devoted to Buddhism were repelled, unable to even enter the pagoda, let alone break the seal…”</p><p>Perhaps a powerful Daoist master could forcibly break the seal.  However, doing so might mean the Vajra Stupa Pagoda would no longer remain at Jingtai Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "Venerable One, you wish me to try entering the pagoda to help you break the seal?"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru nodded, his eyes filled with anticipation.  Although Qin Sang was not a Buddhist practitioner, perhaps his connection to the Seven Masters' Buddha Seal would allow him to gain the pagoda's acceptance.</p><p>"If you can help this monk break the seal, we shall share the pagoda's inheritance. If it contains Buddhist treasures, the temple will compensate you generously; your efforts will not go unrewarded," Venerable Zhenru promised.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart quickened.</p><p>In the foreseeable future, martial prowess would become increasingly important in battles.  Obtaining a powerful ability similar to the Nine Great Luminous Seals from the Vajra Stupa Pagoda would significantly enhance his capabilities.</p><p>Securing a top-tier Buddhist Vajra cultivation technique was something Qin Sang desperately desired.</p><p>He was currently cultivating the Heavenly Demon Transformation, a human cultivating a demon technique, which while progressing well, held hidden risks.  The incompatibility of his bloodline could halt his cultivation at any time.</p><p>Qin Sang had long sought a human body-refinement technique comparable to the Heavenly Demon Transformation as a contingency plan.</p><p>The two quickly reached an agreement.</p><p>There was no time to waste.  Master Zhijian was in seclusion again.  Qin Sang informed Jiannu of his whereabouts and, together with Venerable Zhenru, set off for Jingtai Temple.</p><p>Leaving Zuodai Pass, they continued south.  The Eastern Region, bordering the Demon Kingdom, was chaotic and constantly embroiled in conflict, unlike the western celestial cities connected by convenient small teleportation arrays.</p><p>They sometimes used the city teleportation arrays, other times flying, taking five days to reach Jingtai Temple.</p><p>Jingtai Temple was situated atop Jingtai Mountain, the highest peak in the area, affording a commanding view, even reaching the borders of the Eastern Demon Kingdom.  However, the mountain's slopes were relatively gentle, covered in lush vegetation, and surrounded by many ordinary people who lived under the temple's protection, safe from demonic threats, living peaceful lives.</p><p>Two streaks of light descended from the distance, heading straight for the mountaintop.</p><p>A magnificent temple stood at the summit, its gates open, monks entering and exiting.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru, without disturbing others, quietly led Qin Sang to the abbot's chambers.</p><p>"Please wait a moment."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru went out and soon returned, holding a luminous blue orb in his palm.</p><p>The orb was crystal-clear, like a drop of water.  Venerable Zhenru activated the orb, saying, "This is a recording of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal."</p><p>Viewing the recording was a pre-arranged payment Qin Sang requested. He gazed intently at the orb, seeing a white mist emanating from within.</p><p>The mist coalesced between Venerable Zhenru and him, constantly shifting, gradually revealing blurry images.</p><p>It was a desert, with swirling dust and flying sand; a battle was taking place.</p><p>It was clear that the person recording the image was far from the battlefield, fearing being caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Amidst the swirling sand, two figures were visible.</p><p>One was a demonic beast resembling a griffin, immense in size; the flapping of its grey wings easily stirred up a sandstorm.</p><p>The other was a human, standing in mid-air, facing the ferocious beast without flinching.</p><p>Despite the indistinct image, the figure was clearly a monk in robes, his head shaved.</p><p>Most strikingly, the monk emanated a faint, azure light, like the clear sky or pure water.  This light surrounded him, bright and clear, illuminating everything, piercing through the sand and wind, perfectly visible.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru called it the Pure Glass Treasure Light, a sign of the attainment of the Vajra Glass Body through the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.</p><p>The recording was silent.</p><p>The monk and the beast clashed. Then, enraged, the beast spread its wings, instantly closing in on the monk, its sharp claws aimed at his head.</p><p>Facing the imminent danger, the monk calmly struck out with a palm strike. The flying sand was inexplicably drawn into a spinning vortex.</p><p>A yellow vortex appeared in the air, trapping the beast in its center; the beast frantically flapped its wings.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The wind vortex exploded, releasing tremendous power that surged outwards, carrying a sandstorm that spread rapidly. The recording abruptly ended.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with brilliance.</p><p>That palm strike, first trapping, then exploding, clearly showed the essence of the Wheel Seal and the Demon-Crushing Seal.</p><p>The two seals in the Seven Masters' Buddha Seal were more like crude versions, explaining Venerable Zhenru's belief that they were imitations of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.</p><p>The water-mist-shrouded images flickered repeatedly.  Qin Sang, deeply engrossed, watched them again and again, lost in thought; even the Venerable Zhenru didn't disturb him.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to reconcile the monk's every move with the Seven Masters' Buddha Seals.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang made more discoveries. The monk’s actions felt unique.  The so-called Great Vajra Wheel Seal didn't display extraordinary power when fighting the demonic beast. The monk's movements seemed ordinary, yet he steadily pushed the beast to its limit, effortlessly countering its desperate attacks.  If Qin Sang had to describe it, the word he’d choose was effortless grace.  Each movement was natural, seemingly spontaneous, yet precisely the best option in that moment, as if he controlled everything on the battlefield, leaving himself without flaw while rendering the enemy's threats harmless.</p><p>After mastering the seventh seal, the Vajra Great Ease Seal, Qin Sang had a similar feeling, but compared to the monk, he was merely a beginner.  Of course, the power of the Vajra Glass Body was surely greater; perhaps that beast wasn't strong enough to bring out the monk's full strength. Unfortunately, the image was too short.</p><p>After an unknown number of viewings, Qin Sang finally collected his thoughts.</p><p>"What do you think?" Venerable Zhenru asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "The Venerable's judgment is correct.  There's definitely a profound connection between the two Buddha Seals. Watching this image has greatly benefited me. Thank you."</p><p>These words were not false. Observing the monk's battle had greatly moved Qin Sang. After returning to meditate on it, his understanding of the Seven Masters' Buddha Seals would surely improve greatly.</p><p>Putting away the orb, Venerable Zhenru led Qin Sang towards the rear mountain.  Jingtai Temple's layout was similar to some temples Qin Sang had seen in the Storm World, with numerous pagodas built on the back mountain, enshrining the relics of Jingtai Temple's past high monks.</p><p>Passing through the pagoda forest, the two continued onwards, meandering down a narrow mountain path.  Numerous formations and restrictions lined the way, and Qin Sang sensed the aura of the high monks; the defenses were extremely tight.</p><p>At the end of the path was a deep ravine. Venerable Zhenru tapped the water's surface several times, nodded to Qin Sang, and leaped into the ravine.  Qin Sang followed immediately, encountering no obstruction. He descended rapidly, soon reaching the bottom and seeing a pagoda.</p><p>The pagoda was ancient, hidden underwater, and seven stories high.  This reminded Qin Sang of the seven-story stupa he’d obtained from the Jinghai Sect. The seven-story stupa and the Seven Masters' Buddha Seals were both connected to the Jinghai Sect. However, the seven-story stupa and the seven-story pagoda of Xuan Tian Palace, crafted by Xiao Xiangzi as a warning device, differed in material and design.</p><p>This Vajra Stupa Pagoda appeared to be made of wood – a mysterious black spirit wood.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru landed before the pagoda, pointing to the door and saying to Qin Sang, "Those who cultivate Buddhism may enter through this door; those who do not, may not advance an inch."</p><p>The door was tightly shut. Qin Sang approached, observed for a moment, and without using any magical powers, touched the door.  The instant his hand neared the door, golden light erupted, and a gentle yet immensely powerful force propelled him several meters away.  As he was flung back, the golden light vanished instantly, the door remaining unchanged, with no unusual fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly amazed. Returning to the door, he formed a hand seal, using the Auspicious Seal to circulate his Qi and blood, activating the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal, turning his skin light gold.  Simultaneously, he silently activated the seventh seal, the Vajra Great Ease Seal. He exchanged a glance with Venerable Zhenru and reached out again to touch the door.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's actions, Venerable Zhenru felt a surge of anxiety. If Qin Sang could enter the Vajra Stupa Pagoda using the Seven Masters' Buddha Seals, even if their own strengths were insufficient to break the seal, they could find a way to exchange the seals with Qin Sang and seek stronger help. The secrets within the pagoda would eventually see the light of day.</p><p>In past experiences, non-Buddhists, upon touching the door, were immediately repelled by the gentle golden light, just as had happened before. No matter what they tried, they couldn't penetrate the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang's palm touched the door once more.</p><p>The anxiety on Venerable Zhenru's face instantly transformed into surprise. There was no golden light!</p><p>He exclaimed, "Quickly..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Qin Sang, following Venerable Zhenru's earlier instructions, pressed firmly against a specific point on the door.  The door didn't open, but Qin Sang felt like he’d passed through a barrier.  His figure flickered, and he passed through the door into the Vajra Stupa Pagoda.  Immediately afterward, another figure appeared beside him – Venerable Zhenru, having followed closely behind.</p><p>From the outside, the first floor was no more than ten feet in diameter, yet the interior space was surprisingly vast. The lighting was normal, and the floor was paved with green jade tiles.  Intertwined shadows in front obscured the view, seemingly indicating standing Buddha statues.</p><p>"Stay close behind me," Venerable Zhenru said, stepping forward.  After explorations by past high monks, Jingtai Temple was very familiar with the first half; there would be no danger.</p>
