<h1></h1><p>The imperial carriage sped through the clouds.</p><p>Inside sat two Demon Kings: Li Hong Demon King, subordinate to Snake King and Feather King respectively.</p><p>The Flood Dragon and Luan Phoenix soared through the mists, vigorously pulling the carriage, making the journey as smooth as walking on flat ground.</p><p>With their eyesight, they could clearly see streaks of escape light between the mountains, undoubtedly heading to the same place.</p><p>"Daoist Qin has just founded his sect, yet it already possesses the aura of a renowned and established Immortal Sect,"</p><p>Snake King exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>"I heard that Daoist Qin has been planning for the sect for many years..."</p><p>Li Hong Demon King was somewhat absent-minded. He happened to see several cultivators from the desert and sneered with a frown, "Even people from the desert have come from afar to offer congratulations. It seems the internal unity of the Human Race is growing stronger!"</p><p>Snake King knew what he was worried about and sighed, "The momentum of the times is hard to defy. Only if rifts appear within the Northern Dipper Alliance is there any chance of it falling apart. There is a limit to what we can do. Fortunately, our Demon Race has not been excluded from the Northern Dipper Alliance, otherwise, we would truly be uneasy..."</p><p>The Human and Demon Races would always be different, unable to fully trust each other.</p><p>With the Demon Race being weaker, the perpetual fragmentation of the Northern Dipper Realm was in their interest. They were the most unwilling to see the Human Race allied.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ascension of the Purple Micro Palace was too shocking. Apart from this, all grievances were insignificant. Even if the Demon Race secretly stoked the flames, it would be difficult to achieve results.</p><p>Now, the Human Race could not afford to exclude dissenters. As time goes on, if the Ascension Platform could not be found, and they returned to the past, some would inevitably harbor ambition.</p><p>Li Hong Demon King snorted, "Once the Great King breaks through to the late Transformation stage, he can suppress the Human Race with his own strength and have enough time to plan... I don't believe the Northern Dipper Alliance is monolithic!"</p><p>"Feather King..."</p><p>Snake King secretly shook his head, seemingly not very optimistic about Feather King, and changed his tone, "For now, we can only bide our time and hide our capabilities. Counting the Human Race Nascent Soul cultivators, there are very few who have a chance to advance to the late Nascent Soul stage. Barring any accidents, Daoist Qin's position in the Northern Dipper Alliance will definitely become increasingly important. Daoist Qin has a deep friendship with Daoist Jingyu and is also a descendant of the Bamboo Demon. Even if someone harbors wicked intentions, he will not sit idly by..."</p><p>Years ago, at Jingyu's breakthrough celebration, Feather King personally went to Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea to offer congratulations. The death of the Bamboo Demon was revealed, causing a huge uproar within the Demon Race.</p><p>Li Hong Demon King frowned every time he recalled this matter.</p><p>Back then, he was encouraged by Nine Caves Demon King to probe Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea, but was frightened away by Qin Sang's scheme.</p><p>Looking back, Qin Sang was definitely bluffing. That was the weakest time for Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea!</p><p>Now, it was too late to regret.</p><p>"The Great King also has this intention. Do not antagonize Daoist Qin. If the Great King was not at a critical moment in his closed-door cultivation, he would have wanted to come and offer congratulations in person."</p><p>Snake King chuckled, "Daoist Qin is currently at the height of his popularity, extremely sought-after. Today, I'm afraid we'll see many old fogeys..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Snake King's expression changed slightly, and he suddenly stood up.</p><p>Only then did Li Hong Demon King notice the abnormality and hurriedly got up to follow Snake King out of the imperial carriage.</p><p>They saw a white cloud flying from afar, with two figures riding the cloud, radiating Immortal Qi, leisurely and comfortable.</p><p>One of them was Lu Boyuan.</p><p>Standing next to Lu Boyuan was a youth, exuding a faint demonic aura.</p><p>"Daoist Lu! Daoist Hanxi! I didn't expect you would also come in person," Snake King invited the two to board the imperial carriage, sizing up Hanxi for a moment, "Congratulations to Daoist Hanxi on recovering fully, with no further troubles!"</p><p>"Just fortunate..."</p><p>Hanxi revealed a trace of a smile.</p><p>Lu Boyuan then said, "Daoist Qin is founding his sect, we have no choice but to come!"</p><p>Saying this, he turned his head and asked Li Hong Demon King, "Daoist Li Hong, I wonder how Feather King's injuries are?"</p><p>Li Hong Demon King cupped his hands and said, "The Great King has recovered eighty percent and is not in serious condition."</p><p>While speaking, the imperial carriage flew over the mountains, seeing the towering peaks and auspicious clouds of Azure Goat Temple (Green Ram Temple).</p><p>From afar, they felt the imposing presence of the imperial carriage.</p><p>Li Yufu, with several disciples, hurriedly flew out of Greeting Guest Peak (Welcoming Guest Peak), "Li Yufu, a disciple of Azure Goat Temple, respectfully welcomes the seniors."</p><p>"You are Qin Daoyou's prized disciple, Li Yufu? A fine talent! Not bad!"</p><p>Lu Boyuan and the others walked out of the imperial carriage side by side.</p><p>Seeing so many Demon Kings and Nascent Soul cultivators, Li Yufu was initially shocked. After hearing them explain the identities they represented, he announced loudly.</p><p>"Li Hong Demon King of Myriad Demons City, representing Feather King, offers congratulations!"</p><p>"True Man Lu and Demon King Hanxi offer congratulations!"</p><p>"Snake King of Dragon Transformation Mountain leads his disciples to offer congratulations!"</p><p>...</p><p>The voice spread into Azure Goat Temple, and the noise within the sect ceased. A group of rogue cultivators looked up at the imperial carriage, admiring the demeanor of the Demon Kings and Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Immediately after, nine melodious bell chimes echoed from the main peak, welcoming the most distinguished guests.</p><p>Li Yufu bowed and led the way, guiding Snake King and the others into the main peak. The imperial carriage and other lesser demons were also guided by others.</p><p>Before they could even ascend the main peak, Mei Gu's loud announcement resounded outside Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>"True Man Yue Kui, True Man Yue Wu, True Man Ji..." Mei Gu recited a long list of names in one breath.</p><p>Yue Kui and Yue Wu were the Twin War Generals (Double War Generals), descendants of True One Daoist (True Yi Daoist).</p><p>After the establishment of the Northern Dipper Alliance, the Heavenly Journey Alliance (Sky Wanderer Alliance) existed in name only, but the cultivators of Heavenly Journey Plateau (Sky Wanderer Plateau) were still habitually united, led by the Twin War Generals.</p><p>Snake King and the others stopped and exchanged glances.</p><p>"I didn't expect most of the old fogeys of the Heavenly Journey Alliance would come. Daoist Qin indeed has great influence," Li Hong Demon King chuckled.</p><p>Snake King shook his head, "The Heavenly Journey Alliance has reversed its decline and counterattacked the Sin Abyss. Daoist Qin deserves indelible credit. They should come for both emotional and rational reasons."</p><p>Hanxi sneered, "There is another reason... among the descendants of True One Daoist, only the Yue brothers can still hold up the facade. However, they couldn't break through to the mid Nascent Soul stage even when True One Daoist was alive. I'm afraid it will be even more difficult later. If the Heavenly Journey Alliance continues to have no successors, hmph."</p><p>The three Demon Kings openly discussed the Heavenly Journey Alliance without any scruples.</p><p>Lu Boyuan, being a member of the Human Race, found it inappropriate to participate and turned to urge Li Yufu, who was pretending not to hear anything, to continue leading the way.</p><p>After welcoming the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Heavenly Journey Alliance into Azure Goat Temple, the sound of bells continued without end.</p><p>"True Man Bing Han of Void Spirit Sect leads his disciples to offer congratulations!"</p><p>"True Man Si Di and True Man Yao Jing of Grand Yi Pill Sect lead their disciples to offer congratulations!"</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang's founding of his sect had become the grandest event in the entire Northern Dipper Realm, with Nascent Soul Grandmasters rarely seen in the past arriving one after another.</p><p>The rogue cultivators at the foot of the mountain looked up, dazzled. Listening to each thunderous name, they felt their necks stiffen, feeling that the trip was well worth it.</p><p>Demon Hill of the Heavens (Celestial Demon Hill), the desert, the Heavenly Journey Alliance, Little Cold Region (Lesser Frost Region), and the Sin Abyss all sent Nascent Soul cultivators to offer congratulations.</p><p>True Man Cang Hong and other Nascent Soul cultivators of the Sin Abyss were currently exploring the bottom of the Sky Trace (Heavenly Scar), hoping to find fragments of the Abyss Ruins (Abyssal Ruins), so they sent Fairy Qiu Zhi as their representative to send congratulatory gifts.</p><p>In addition to the Nascent Soul cultivators and renowned sects, there were other sects of all sizes. Especially the sects in the Little Cold Region closest to Azure Goat Temple, almost without exception.</p><p>When the names of Mu Yifeng and Lesser Hua Mountain (Minor Flowery Mountain) were announced, it caused a stir.</p><p>Qin Sang's grudge with Dongyang Bo, although not known to everyone, was no secret among the upper echelons.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Lesser Hua Mountain would be present, and even more unexpectedly, the sect leader of Lesser Hua Mountain had been replaced silently!</p>
