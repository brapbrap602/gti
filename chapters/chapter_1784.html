<h1>Chapter 1775: The Conferment Ceremony</h1><p>Outside Immortal Lake.</p><p>A cloudless sky.</p><p>A white cloud hurtles southward at an unnatural speed, instantly recognizable to any cultivator as a spell in progress.</p><p>Dozens of figures stand atop the cloud, led by a middle-aged Daoist priest who controls its movement.</p><p>His followers range in age, half being energetic youths, gazing about with wide-eyed wonder.  Only upon seeing hills the size of houses below do they realize their altitude, prompting them to draw closer to their elders.</p><p>The young men and women gaze at the Daoist's back with expectant faces.</p><p>Qin Sang is among them.</p><p>Since meeting Master Qi, Qin Sang hasn't stopped gathering information, frequently visiting Master Qi's estate for guidance.</p><p>Days of investigation have yielded a wealth of secrets, forming a plan in his mind: to acquire the High-Heaven Godly Orders of the Left and Right Thunder Palaces!</p><p>He learned that the Left and Right Thunder Palaces utilize the same type of talismans.</p><p>Like the Tao Heng Mountain talismans, the High-Heaven Godly Orders of the Left and Right Thunder Palaces are two-tiered, specifically the Supreme Boy-God Official General talisman and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell talisman.</p><p>Regardless of the sect or even the two academies of the Daoist Court, the initial-level talisman is always the Supreme Boy-God Official General talisman.</p><p>However, despite the same name, the incantations differ, and the corresponding divine officials and generals are distinct and shouldn't be confused.</p><p>Because of the discord between the Left and Right Thunder Palaces, with proper strategy, obtaining both talismans would allow Qin Sang to quickly forge a Xuan Ascension altar, then seek ascension qualifications from the Daoist Sect.</p><p>This would ensure peaceful cultivation until at least the Unity stage, eliminating the need to worry about talismans.</p><p>Ascension is difficult, so Qin Sang plans to seek guidance from the Sword-Wielding Real Person first.</p><p>However, he won't visit Sword Heart Island yet, intending to do so after obtaining the High-Heaven Godly Orders.</p><p>But before acquiring the High-Heaven Godly Orders, Qin Sang must address a critical issue.</p><p>His greatest risk is being discovered as a high-cultivation individual without having undergone a conferment ceremony, making his strength inexplicable.</p><p>Originally, Qin Sang planned to receive conferment from a weaker faction, making it easier to handle any unexpected incidents.</p><p>Once possessing an altar, he could then join a prominent sect and change to his desired talisman without worry.</p><p>But his investigation revealed things are more complex.</p><p>Changing talismans, called "adding conferments" in the Daoist Court—a process jokingly referred to as a promotion—seems impossible in most mountain-based sects.</p><p>And most people don't need to add conferments.</p><p>In this world, the scriptures and conferment ceremonies are viewed separately.</p><p>Outside the Daoist Sect, the primary purpose of a conferment ceremony is to resist the Six Heavens' inherent energy; most cultivators still practice the methods passed down from their lineage.</p><p>Therefore, as long as the talisman is similar to their lineage's method and doesn't cause conflicts, most cultivators don't consider changing talismans after conferment.</p><p>Even if they develop animosity with the faction that conferred them, changing talismans isn't necessary. Upon breakthrough, they can simply choose a similar talisman from another sect for ascension.</p><p>For example, Tao Heng Mountain uses Water-attribute talismans. If a disciple rebels, they can change their name and seek another Water-attribute talisman for ascension at breakthrough.</p><p>Such an altar might lack the stability of a lineage-based one and hold future risks, but nine times out of ten, they won't live to face them.</p><p>At least, Qin Sang has met many experts and hasn't found a sect near Star Island Immortal Lake capable of adding conferments.</p><p>Following his original plan might force him to seek the Daoist Court, so he decides against this detour and opts for a more straightforward solution.</p><p>Qin Sang needs to participate in a conferment ceremony to confirm whether his cultivation will be detected.</p><p>If exposure is unavoidable, Qin Sang doesn't want to be targeted by the Daoist Sect. Only by directly controlling the sect can he keep the secret, ruling out the prominent sects as options.</p><p>So, Qin Sang found a sect outside Star Island Immortal Lake and obtained a conferment qualification.</p><p>The Daoist priest leading the cloud is Yang Luo, a Golden Core cultivator from the Three Suns Sect.</p><p>The Three Suns Sect altar confers Fire-attribute Three Suns talismans, and importantly, sells some of its conferment qualifications.</p><p>Qin Sang has dispersed his true essence, leaving his energy sea empty, disguising himself as a novice cultivator and following Yang Luo to the Three Suns Sect for the conferment.</p><p>Everyone else has an elder accompanying them, but he's alone, causing the other youths to eye him with curiosity.</p><p>Despite coming alone, Superior Yang Luo dares not show any disrespect, as Qin Sang's 'master' is a Real Person.</p><p>After the initial excitement, the young disciples start whispering to each other, growing louder as they realize no one is reprimanding them.</p><p>At that moment, Superior Yang Luo turns his head.</p><p>Silence immediately falls.</p><p>Superior Yang Luo scans the youths, saying coldly:  "The rules of the conferment ceremony should have been explained to you by your elders. Let me reiterate! Three Masters will attend the ceremony. I'm your recommending instructor; I can tolerate your offending me, but..."</p><p>Should you misbehave and anger the instructors, you will be expelled.  Even if your master is present, there will be no leniency.  And, your spiritual stones will not be returned!”  Master Yang Luo’s expression was severe.</p><p>The boys and girls were frightened; the timid ones even trembled slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang and their master knew Master Yang Luo meant every word.</p><p>The instructors were those who presided over the initiation ceremonies.</p><p>The supervisors held even higher positions, filled by highly respected individuals, at least elders of the sect, responsible for overseeing the ceremonies.</p><p>They had the authority to expel or even kill anyone disrupting the initiation ceremonies.</p><p>It was said that the Daoist sect also had six master protectors of the altar to ensure that the entire ceremony proceeded strictly according to Daoist rites.</p><p>Master Yang Luo then explained further rules. The young people nodded vigorously, their playful chatter gone.</p><p>…</p><p>The cloud plunged downwards, then everyone felt a jolt beneath their feet.  When the clouds dispersed, they found themselves on a stone platform atop a cliff.</p><p>“Follow me.”</p><p>Master Yang Luo walked towards the summit along the stone steps; everyone quickly followed.</p><p>Shortly after, a young man approached.</p><p>Master Yang Luo stopped and greeted him with a smile, “Third Senior Brother, where are you going?”</p><p>“Oh, Ninth Junior Brother is back.”</p><p>The young man glanced at the group behind Master Yang Luo.  “Is the sect holding another initiation ceremony?  How are the aptitudes of these disciples you brought?”</p><p>Master Yang Luo shook his head slightly, “These are not disciples of the Three Yang Sect. Their aptitude is irrelevant to us.”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others stood behind, watching the two converse.</p><p>Hearing Master Yang Luo’s words, Qin Sang’s mind stirred, and he glanced at the group.</p><p>Since arriving in this world, Qin Sang had discovered that the concept of ‘spiritual roots’ didn't exist here, but aptitudes varied.</p><p>He had secretly checked these boys and girls; all possessed fire affinities, clearly no coincidence.</p><p>After a brief conversation with Master Yang Luo, the young man was about to leave when Master Yang Luo quickly called out, “Senior Brother, do you know which elder will be the supervisor for this ceremony?”</p><p>The young man pondered for a moment, then said, “It should be Master Uncle’s turn this time.”</p><p>“It’s Master Uncle!”</p><p>Master Yang Luo breathed a sigh of relief.  Not only was he close to him, but Master Uncle was also known for his kindness, so there would be no worries about reprimand.</p><p>Master Yang Luo then settled them in a dormitory and left, only returning seven days later to take them to the Three Yang Sect initiation hall.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang saw the Three Yang Sect altar.</p><p>Outsiders were barred from the initiation hall.</p><p>They were first led into a courtyard with a plaque bearing the words ‘Three Yang Altar’.</p><p>Inside the courtyard was a large plaza, with a large incense burner in the center, fragrant smoke rising from it.</p><p>Behind the plaza stood a large hall, its roof adorned with purple mist, a plaque hanging above the entrance – Three Yang Hall.</p><p>When they entered, there were three groups of people in the plaza, all standing outside the incense burner, totaling several hundred – the three types of disciples participating in the initiation.</p><p>The first were Three Yang Sect disciples, the second were Three Yang Sect affiliates, and the third were outsiders like Qin Sang.</p><p>The doors of the Three Yang Hall were closed.  Several young Taoists stood sparsely in front of the hall, some holding banners, others pacing back and forth.  The atmosphere was solemn, yet somehow crude.</p><p>“Didn’t Father say the initiation ceremony was very grand?”</p><p>Beside Qin Sang, a girl looked disappointed and turned to her brother.</p><p>The boy, calm and composed, shook his head slightly. “Father was referring to the Daoist initiation ceremony. He once had the opportunity to witness it. He said that not only was the ceremony grand, but the rules were also numerous. From the opening ceremony, the performance of rituals, the presentation of documents, offerings of incense, to the welcoming of guests, the inviting of masters, the worship of deities, the ancestral rites, the presentation of petitions, the final thanksgiving, etc., it was incredibly complex. The Three Yang Sect is not a mainline Daoist sect.  They value simplicity, so they have made this ceremony simpler. A few days ago, Master Yang Luo explained the rites in the sky, even the performance of rituals.”</p><p>The girl, still confused, nodded.</p><p>At this moment, a Three Yang Sect disciple walked over, swept his gaze across the crowd, and shouted coldly, “Silence!”</p><p>Instant silence.</p><p>A chime sounded, and the Three Yang Hall slowly opened.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed as he saw the interior of the hall.  Two statues stood at the back of the hall, the founding ancestors of the Three Yang Sect.</p><p>A long table was placed in front of the statues.</p><p>The statues and table occupied only a tenth of the hall's space. The most striking feature inside the Three Yang Hall was an altar.</p><p>The altar's design was similar to those Qin Sang had seen before, divided into three levels: a circular top, an octagonal middle, and a square bottom, symbolizing the Three Heavens and Three Realms.</p><p>This altar was the Three Yang Sect altar!</p><p>At that moment, Three Yang Sect disciples, each holding banners, emerged from the hall and stood in two rows before it.</p><p>Only two Taoists remained in the hall – Elder Sheng Xuan and another high-haired Taoist nearly at Sheng Xuan’s level.</p><p>They stood before the incense table, holding offerings of incense, and performed prostrations before the ancestral statues, chanting scriptures.</p><p>Qin Sang listened for a few moments, recognizing the incantation as a Daoist ritual, though poorly adapted.  Daoist rituals invoke deities; the Sanyang Sect attributed everything to their ancestral masters.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang and the others waiting for the ritual, led by Sanyang disciples, chanted the incantation, essentially supplicating for divine grace and blessings.</p><p>The Sanyang ceremony was indeed simple; the incantation preceded the granting of the talisman.  First to receive it were the Sanyang inner disciples.  The young men and women on the left side of the square stepped forward one by one.  The first, a slender youth, nervously entered the Sanyang Hall after receiving permission.</p><p>"Kneel!"</p><p>A high-haired Daoist priest, the officiant of the ceremony, standing before the altar, barked the command.  An older priest, the supervisor, stood to the side.</p><p>The youth trembled and knelt.  The officiant gently raised his whisk, bowed towards heaven, and without any visible action, the Sanyang altar suddenly blazed with golden light.</p><p>The radiant light was blinding; if not for the Hall's protective barriers, the surrounding peaks would have been bathed in golden splendor.  When the light subsided, Qin Sang saw a golden seal hovering above the altar.  The seal seemed to bear inscriptions, but they shifted constantly, making them impossible to decipher.</p><p>The officiant turned to the supervisor, who nodded.  The officiant then made a hand gesture.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened. Though he refrained from directly using his spiritual sense to investigate, he sensed a resonance between the altar and some unknown force since the seal appeared.</p><p>A talismatic image flew from the altar, forming a blank golden talisman before the youth's forehead.</p><p>"Awaken your spiritual sense," the officiant softly commanded, simultaneously using his whisk to draw a drop of blood from the youth's palm.</p><p>All present had cultivated spiritual awareness, albeit weak.  However, with the officiant's assistance, the youth successfully awakened a thread of spiritual energy, which was then merged with the blood drop into the blank talisman.  Instantly, the talisman resonated with the youth's unique energy signature.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The officiant made another hand gesture.  A golden beam shot from the altar seal into the talisman, leaving its mark. The talisman split into two; one flew into the youth's forehead, the other returned to the altar, self-immolating without flame, instantly consumed by fire.  This act of burning the talisman was an offering to the heavens, announcing the event to the cosmos, signifying the completion of the ritual. The disciple now possessed the ability to summon spirits.</p><p>Joy spread across the youth's face.  With the talismanic power within him, even before establishing a spiritual foundation, he felt an unprecedented sense of stability.  After achieving initial spiritual awareness, he had dared not continue cultivation, but now he could finally resume his practice normally.</p><p>The youth prostrated and withdrew; the next disciple entered.  One by one, the disciples received their talismans.  Once all Sanyang disciples had been granted their talismans, then the affiliated sects, and finally the outer sect members.  It was Qin Sang's turn.</p><p>Qin Sang did not stand out, kneeling on a cushion like the others, gazing at the altar seal.  The closer he was, the more clearly he felt the strange energy emanating from the altar and the seal.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A blank golden talisman appeared before him.  Qin Sang had softened his palm and prepared a thread of his spiritual sense beforehand.</p><p>The officiant remained oblivious, merging his blood and spiritual sense into the blank talisman and stamping it with the seal's mark.  Immediately, Qin Sang felt a strange connection form between himself and the talisman.</p><p>"Nothing unusual…"</p><p>Qin Sang kept a watchful eye on the supervisor.  The altar, the talisman, and the officiant all seemed normal—none had detected his true cultivation level!</p><p>The officiant was about to burn the talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped him, "Wait!"</p><p>Everyone stared at him dumbfounded.</p><p>"I won't accept the talisman," Qin Sang shook his head and stood up.</p><p>"What did you say?" The officiant was stunned; he'd never seen this before.</p><p>"I've changed my mind. I don't want the Sanyang talisman," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Impudent brat!"</p><p>The supervisor flew into a rage, murderous intent flashing in his eyes.  The altar ritual was costly in terms of spiritual stones and materials, and the number of recipients was limited. Once designated, there could be no changes—this was a wasted quota.</p><p>Yang Luo, outside the hall, was visibly anxious, quickly transmitting a message to his senior explaining the youth's background.</p><p>The supervisor's face twitched.  Enraged, he shattered the talisman and struck Qin Sang with a palm strike, roaring, "Get out!"</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Amidst the varied expressions, Qin Sang spun and flew out of the mountain.</p><p></p>
