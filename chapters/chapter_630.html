<h1>Chapter 622: The Stormy Demon Sea</h1><p>“Medicine meets its Qi and forms its image, the Dao unites with the mysterious and becomes natural.  One golden elixir swallowed into the belly, then one knows that one's fate is not determined by Heaven.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi bowed deeply to the ground, his tone filled with deep admiration, tinged with a hint of sadness, finally culminating in a congratulatory remark, “Congratulations, senior, on your successful alchemy.”</p><p>Qin Sang appeared very young, looking around twenty years old, while Cui Xuanzi was white-haired and aged.</p><p>If ordinary people witnessed this scene, they would surely be astonished, thinking the roles should be reversed.</p><p>But in the cultivation world, where strength reigns supreme, this was perfectly normal.</p><p>“The initial attainment of the Golden Core is merely shedding some constraints. The path to immortality remains arduous, with countless powerful cultivators; I dare not claim that my fate is not governed by Heaven.”</p><p>A slight smile played on Qin Sang's lips. He recalled his flying night-fork, then looked towards the direction where the Five Insects Sect disciples had departed.  “Does your sect have any free Golden Core cultivators?  My Golden Core has just been formed, and I have many questions. I hope to pay a visit and discuss the Dao with them.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's eyes flickered at this, his voice unwavering as he explained, “With respect to Senior Qin, my uncle, after attaining the Golden Core, unexpectedly embarked on a journey.  It is uncertain if he has left the Western Frontier yet.  It is said that he intends to invite fellow cultivators to hunt demons in the Stormy Demon Sea. It is unlikely he will return anytime soon. If senior could stay a few more days, I shall send a message to my uncle.”</p><p>Earlier, Cui Xuanzi had noticed that although Qin Sang controlled the flying night-fork, his tone was amicable, not like a bloodthirsty demon; his worries had lessened somewhat.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang suddenly mention a Golden Core cultivator, Cui Xuanzi's heart leaped again.</p><p>The Five Insects Sect did indeed have a Golden Core cultivator, Cui Xuanzi's uncle.</p><p>But this uncle had gone on a journey when Cui Xuanzi had recently taken over as sect leader.  Now Cui Xuanzi was nearing the end of his life, and his uncle remained untraceable, without even a spirit lamp to indicate his fate.</p><p>Currently, they didn't even know if their uncle was alive or dead.</p><p>Outsiders wouldn't know the truth, and could use the uncle's title as a pretense, but Cui Xuanzi wouldn't actively reveal this to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Stormy Demon Sea…</p><p>Qin Sang heard a new place name; it sounded similar to the Heavenly Demon Mound, likely a territory of demonic beasts.</p><p>However, Golden Core cultivators would actually go there together to hunt demons? The demonic beasts in the Stormy Demon Sea must have a less amicable relationship with cultivators than those in the Heavenly Demon Mound.</p><p>“Forget it. I came to the Western Frontier to search for spiritual insects suitable for a life-bound insect charm.  I heard that the Western Frontier is a wild land, abundant in spiritual insects, with many rare and unseen ones.  Attaining the Golden Core here was unexpected, I won't stay in your Xiong Mountain region for long.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Cui Xuanzi; his sharp eyes discerned that Cui Xuanzi's words were not entirely truthful, but he didn't probe further, waving his hand, "Since that cultivator is not here, there's no need for any fuss.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang finished speaking, he found Cui Xuanzi staring at him with a look of astonishment, as if he had heard something unbelievable.</p><p>"Senior hasn't even chosen a life-bound insect charm, and yet… you've already formed a Golden Core?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi looked utterly incredulous.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.  Cui Xuanzi’s reaction was so extreme. Could life-bound insect charms have some connection to Golden Core formation?</p><p>After that exchange with Yuan Hu…</p><p>Qin Sang learned that the relationship between the Witch Clan and the Human Clan was extremely poor, marked by war and mutual hatred.</p><p>The Witch Clan had been driven to the Witch God Continent, fueling even greater hatred towards the Human Clan. Even Yuan Hu, who had never left the Xiong Mountain region, held such sentiments.  Qin Sang felt it best to disguise himself as a member of the Witch Clan.</p><p>Fortunately, through these two observations, Qin Sang found that the Human and Witch Clans appeared to have no outward differences.</p><p>The Witch Clan called cultivators “Witch God emissaries” and had many strange customs.</p><p>But after interacting with Yuan Hu and Cui Xuanzi, two cultivators from the Five Insects Sect, Qin Sang discovered that those Witch Clan customs had faded, their speech and actions not very different from human cultivators; Qin Sang just needed to be slightly cautious.</p><p>Only the Bimôs and priests of those villages retained their bizarre customs completely.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed they did this to maintain their authority among the common people.</p><p>The Witch Clan feared the power of the Witch God emissaries, yet firmly believed in the Witch God. This belief, seemingly ethereal, was sometimes incredibly powerful.</p><p>Witch Clan cultivators excelled in insect control, even refining spiritual insects into life-bound insect charms.</p><p>He wondered what path the human cultivators here had taken, if it was the same as the Witch Clan.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang calmly said, “I have been in seclusion for many years, and I have not found a suitable life-bound insect charm, so I delayed.”</p><p>Some time ago, I encountered a bottleneck in my cultivation, so I decided to travel to find suitable spirit insects and gain some experience. Unexpectedly, I spontaneously achieved Golden Core breakthrough on the way, something even I didn't anticipate.”</p><p>Qin Sang was lying.</p><p>He inwardly scoffed, *Do you know how many hardships I endured to reach this stage?*</p><p>“Senior's talent is unparalleled; I've never seen anything like it…”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was astonished by Qin Sang, repeatedly shaking his head. “To achieve Golden Core without relying on a natal insect, even the most elite disciples of the major sects in the Western Border wouldn't be able to match you...If you require anything during your travels in the Western Border, please don't hesitate to ask. My disciples and I will do our utmost to assist you.”</p><p>Discovering that Qin Sang didn't even possess a natal insect, Cui Xuanzi became even more convinced of Qin Sang's extraordinary background, and felt a desire to curry favor.</p><p>Qin Sang, naturally, showed no embarrassment.</p><p>Hearing Cui Xuanzi's words, his curiosity grew.</p><p>Could it be that the cultivation methods of the Wu people for reaching Golden Core differed from those of the Xiaohan region, where various elixirs and spiritual objects were relied upon, instead using natal insects?</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Cui Xuanzi with an amused expression, softly chuckling, “If I were to borrow a look at your sect's treasured secret techniques, would you be willing?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's expression changed. He hadn't expected Qin Sang to covet their sect's secrets.</p><p>The forces behind this person must be extraordinary; what could a small sect like theirs possibly offer him?</p><p>“Senior must be joking. In the Western Border, the various cultivation methods are actually quite similar. Our sect's techniques are quite rudimentary, and I'm afraid they wouldn't interest you,” Cui Xuanzi forced a smile.</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, “I wouldn't jest about such a matter.  Learning from a variety of sources broadens one's understanding. Anything beneficial to my cultivation piques my interest.  Your sect's ability to stand in the Western Border, becoming a dominant force in the Xiong Mountain region and producing Golden Core cultivators, must mean you possess certain strengths. Borrowing a look might allow me to gain new insights. Of course, I wouldn't force you...”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi inwardly lamented, regretting invoking his master's reputation.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang retrieved an item from a storage ring and showed it to Cui Xuanzi.</p><p>“If you're willing, I can exchange this for it.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi looked intently, seeing a piece of talisman paper, and felt puzzled.</p><p>Upon recognizing the talisman's true nature, Cui Xuanzi's face showed shock, “This is a talisman treasure?”</p>
