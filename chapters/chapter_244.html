<h1>**Chapter 237: Decision**</h1><p>**Chapter 237: Decision**</p><p>The immortal's abode was boundless and majestic.</p><p>The surroundings were eerily quiet and deserted.</p><p>On the pitch-black stone tablet, a spiraling vortex emerged. It grew increasingly deep and enigmatic until a woman wearing a palace robe emerged from it. It was Sikong Muyue.</p><p>As she stepped out and turned around to observe the tablet, her gaze gradually swept across her surroundings, taking in every detail. She was the only living soul in sight.</p><p>Appearing the first in the ancient immortal's dwelling, Sikong Muyue retracted her observant eyes, a pondering expression clouding her face. A moment later, a glimmer of surprise danced in her eyes. Reaching forward, she opened her palm, manifesting a ball of light that swiftly took the form of a vibrant butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly fluttered and danced, circling her before soaring westward toward the towering mountains that lay in that direction.</p><p>The butterfly's speed was astounding. Within seconds, it had traveled hundreds of miles. Sikong Muyue's eyes gleamed as her figure vanished, effortlessly keeping pace with the butterfly.</p><p>Past several mountain ridges, the butterfly finally hovered over an inconspicuous mountain summit.</p><p>Timeworn stone halls stood silently upon the mountain, forming a connected labyrinth. They exuded an air of ancient mystery, yet they were in a state of disrepair, reduced to mere broken walls and crumbling ruins. The interiors were littered with debris, suggesting that they had already been ransacked.</p><p>The butterfly flew into one of the stone halls and vanished.</p><p>Sikong Muyue swiftly followed, her figure landing before the stone hall with a gentle grace. Immediately, hurried footsteps echoed from within. Yun Youzi emerged, hastily bowing to Sikong Muyue.</p><p>"Disciple Yun Youzi greets Master Sikong!"</p><p>To a mortal, it might seem peculiar for an elder with flowing white hair to perform such a deep bow to a woman who appeared to be in her twenties.</p><p>Within the cultivation world, however, this was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>"I'm indeed surprised that you managed to pass the trial so quickly," Sikong Muyue studied Yun Youzi closely, her gaze penetrating. "There have been rumors within the sect that Master Piao Ya favored you as a true disciple and passed down his inheritance before his departure. It seems there may be some truth to these whispers."</p><p>Yun Youzi offered no defense, replying respectfully: "Reporting to Master, this disciple feared keeping Master waiting, potentially hindering her important matters."</p><p>"What use could this abandoned ruin have, ravaged as it has been?"</p><p>Sikong Muyue dismissed the dilapidated sight with a disdainful laugh. She then fixed her gaze on Yun Youzi, her voice laden with contemplation. "Before Master Piao Ya's passing, he asked me a favor, a promise that I would lend my full support to you in the future. When the time came for you to break through to Foundation Establishment, you chose to venture out on a sect trial rather than seek my help with a Foundation Establishment pill. Your decision impressed me. Who would have expected that you would use this favor upon this desolate relic... Remember, there is only one opportunity. Have you deliberated carefully?"</p><p>After a brief pause, recalling the care that Master Piao Ya had shown her, Sikong Muyue's heart softened, and she added, "If you save this favor for the future, when you reach Core Formation, simply ask me. I will acquire for you the two rarest spirit medicines, the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower. I will keep my word."</p><p>Yun Youzi took a deep breath and said resolutely: "Thank you for your guidance, Master. This disciple has made up his mind. I ask Master to assist me now."</p><p>Sikong Muyue's gaze turned cold, and she gave a slight nod.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>With that, Sikong Muyue soared toward the depths of the ancient immortal's abode.</p><p>Yun Youzi swiftly followed.</p><p>...</p><p>"In other words, the strength of the armored deities in the passage adapts to the strength of those who enter?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered after hearing of Yun Qiong's experience.</p><p>Yun Qiong's cultivation base was slightly more profound than his own, so the armored deities that posed a challenge to Qin Sang would have been easy for Yun Qiong to deal with.</p><p>It seemed the might of the armored deities was not fixed.</p><p>"I handled the trial poorly. I was no match for the armored deities and suffered injuries. When I reached the stone disc, I was careless, which disturbed those monstrous birds. Without the chance to heal, I had no choice but to flee in a panic. I'm ashamed, Qin fellow daoist, to have made such a mess of things..."</p><p>Yun Qiong's face was flushed with embarrassment.</p><p>With her cultivation level, she shouldn't have been in such a sorry state. It was her own lack of caution that led to her mishandling of the crisis, triggering a chain reaction that nearly cost her her life.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with indifference, his eyes flickering with a change of tone as he asked, "Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong has decided not to continue but to leave the ancient ruins?"</p><p>He had saved the Scattered Cultivator Yun Qiong in order to recruit him as a helper. However, the Scattered Cultivator Yun Qiong surprised him. After healing his wounds and pondering at length, he told him that he would not be going any further but would return the way they came and leave through the stone tablet.</p><p>The stone platform they were on now did not have a stone tablet. To leave the ancient ruins, they had to either continue moving forward or return the way they came.</p><p>This left Qin Sang very dissatisfied, but he did not show it on his face.</p><p>Yun Qiong let out an "Mm" and smiled bitterly, "I have just been in danger, which has made my heart restless. My mind is still unstable. If I continue forward, I will become a frightened bird. In such a perilous place, this will not be a good thing. Not only will I put myself in danger, I will also drag down Fellow Daoist Qin. I truly cannot continue. Fortunately, I have also gained a lot this time. If I go back and reflect upon it carefully, it will not have been in vain."</p><p>Yun Qiong was able to resist the allure of the treasures in the ancient ruins and make such a choice. It was unexpected by Qin Sang but also reasonable.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded without saying anything more. One cannot force a melon to ripen; since Yun Qiong was determined to leave, he could not force him to stay.</p><p>At this moment, Yun Qiong's expression became serious. "Fellow Daoist Qin saved my life, and I will definitely remember it in my heart. This time, I have played the role of a deserter and cannot repay this kindness. I am uneasy in my heart, so I can only do my best to help Fellow Daoist Qin with the Five-colored Glass, so that you may return with a full load..."</p><p>After hearing Yun Qiong's explanation, Qin Sang found out that a part of the might of her Five-colored Glass had turned into a cloud of colored mist that she could give to someone else to use.</p><p>Moreover, this part of her might could separate from the main body and exist for a period of time.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang would only need to move his mind, and he could easily activate this cloud of colored mist to protect his body, and he would not need to use his own spiritual power.</p><p>However, the power that was separated came from the source power of this magic weapon. After it was separated, Yun Qiong would need to recuperate for two years to recover it.</p><p>"By damaging the Five-colored Glass, how will you deal with those firebirds when you go back?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the Five-colored Glass was Yun Qiong's most powerful magic weapon. If it was damaged, it would greatly affect her strength.</p><p>"Rest assured, Fellow Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Yun Qiong said confidently, "Since I already know the habits of these strange birds, I will not be helpless like I was before. I should be able to escape, otherwise I will have lived this life in vain."</p>
