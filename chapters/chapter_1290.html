Chapter 1282: Overconfidence Leads to Downfall

Like a surging tide, figures rushed through the tear in the wind pillar and charged into the grand formation. On the battlefield, Qing Jun and the other cultivators controlling the formation tools remained unmoved, still focusing all their energy on condensing the wind force, relentlessly attacking the Sky Lake and pulling at the fabric of space. The cultivators from the Two Realms Alliance could be described as "pouring in."

Though the charging cultivators seemed somewhat chaotic, every squad maintained their formation and discipline. Tempered by countless battles, everyone understood that chaos on the battlefield meant certain death.

Qin Sang, holding a wooden token in one hand and toying with the Kirin Hairpin in the other, drifted into the Sky Lake. Through the torn waters, the true form of Twin Mirror Mountain could faintly be seen. The mountain was covered in snow, and the cultivators from the Sin Abyss stood in orderly ranks, their expressions grave. At the sound of battle cries, they swooped down upon the invading enemies, their treasures and spells flying in unison.

The tear in the Sky Lake was uneven, forcing the battlefield to fragment into smaller skirmishes. Here, water waves and mist mingled together, and both sides wielded the power of their formations to annihilate their foes. Thunder and fire erupted across the heavens, and various attacks frequently materialized. Both sides were well-prepared, employing their own methods to evade or block the onslaught.

Amidst this chaos, everyone clashed in a fierce melee. Qin Sang weaved through the formations, wielding the Kirin Hairpin. Whenever an opportunity arose, even if the opponent was merely at the Core Formation or Foundation Establishment stage, he showed no mercy. Following Madam Luo's habits, Qin Sang activated the Kirin Hairpin, suspending it before his chest. At times, it shot out hairpin shadows like sharp swords, and at others, it transformed into a ferocious Kirin, pouncing on enemies with a terrifying aura that struck fear into their hearts.

He silently observed his surroundings, waiting for enemies to come to him. After reaping several lives, Qin Sang sensed something and frowned slightly. He turned his gaze toward another part of the battlefield, pondered for a moment, and then subtly moved in that direction.

In that direction, several squads from the Two Realms Alliance were making a remarkable showing. These squads not only included Core Formation cultivators but also demon beasts at the Demon Core stage, wreaking havoc in the enemy ranks and sending their opponents fleeing in disarray.

They were none other than Li Yufu, Mei Gu, and Fat Chicken, among others. As the great battle commenced, no one could remain untouched. Qin Sang had intended for them to gain experience and had ordered them to lead their own squads, grouped together so they could support one another.

Qin Sang was well aware of the consequences of standing out on the battlefield, but it seemed these juniors had yet to grasp this lesson. Among them, who could be more flamboyant than Fat Chicken?

Recently, Fat Chicken had been in high spirits, having successfully broken through to the late stage of Transformation. He had personally slain his enemy and rescued his mother, leaving him in an exceptionally buoyant mood. Jing Yu was on her way but would not make it in time for this battle. However, before departing, she had prepared several protective treasures for Fat Chicken.

With his powerful bloodline, Fat Chicken had always been a standout among cultivators and demon beasts of his level. Now, with these new treasures, he was like a tiger with wings, virtually unmatched and unleashing his full might.

Caught up in the thrill of battle, Fat Chicken and his mischievous companion, White Crane, shouted and hollered. Though Li Yufu and the others remained calm, their strength paled in comparison to Fat Chicken's, and they struggled to keep up, desperately trying to rein him in.

At that moment, several squads of Sin Abyss cultivators charged toward them, their momentum fierce and clearly targeting them. There was no time to retreat, and the group had no choice but to engage in full force.

"Go!" Fat Chicken summoned the Thunder Bead, his overconfidence evident as he flapped his wings majestically forward, exuding an air of invincibility. White Crane, ever the instigator, cheered loudly, and even Yue'er couldn't hold him back.

A thunderhawk composed of lightning shot straight toward the enemy formation, with Li Yufu and the others' attacks following closely behind. The Sin Abyss cultivators, sensing the threat, quickly gathered together, activating the power of their formation for protection and summoning their own treasures and artifacts to block the assault.

*Boom!*

The thunderhawk exploded upon impact. The Thunder Bead, having been refined by Jing Yu and handed over to Fat Chicken, was no ordinary artifact. Combined with Fat Chicken's own formidable strength, its power was extraordinary.

In the blinding flash of lightning, countless electric serpents scattered in all directions, accompanied by cries of shock and pain. Fat Chicken cackled with laughter, bathed in the glow of thunder, and led his squad in a charge.

Unfortunately, the Sin Abyss cultivators were not so easily defeated. Having witnessed Fat Chicken's prowess, they had come prepared. Though they appeared to be in dire straits, their injuries were not severe, and they quickly organized a counterattack.

Fat Chicken and his companions suddenly found themselves in darkness as earthen spikes appeared before them, their sharp tips aimed directly at them and shooting forward. Startled, the group halted their advance and summoned their own treasures and artifacts to smash the spikes.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

The spikes shattered into pieces, sending shards of stone flying in all directions. Seizing the opportunity, the Sin Abyss cultivators adjusted their formation and pressed the attack, their eyes gleaming with desire as they focused on the Thunder Bead, clearly coveting the powerful artifact.

Enraged, Fat Chicken clawed at the spikes, ordering an urgent assault. The high-ranking Sin Abyss cultivators exchanged glances and subtly shifted their formation, engaging Fat Chicken's group in a tug-of-war.

For a time, the battle raged on, with colorful lights flying back and forth, creating a dazzling spectacle. Fat Chicken, however, found himself at a disadvantage. The Sin Abyss had assigned several cultivators specifically to keep him in check, leaving him feeling constrained. Gradually, his mind cooled, and he realized that no matter how strong he was, he could not act with impunity like a fully transformed demon.

As Fat Chicken began to take corrective measures, a frantic shout from Li Yufu rang out behind him.

"Junior Sister, be careful!"

The junior sister he referred to was none other than Mei Gu, Qin Sang's newly accepted disciple. Li Yufu cared deeply for the Green Goat Temple, even more so than Qin Sang. Mei Gu was the second Core Formation disciple of the temple after him, and the two had always been close.

In the chaos of battle, their formation had unknowingly been torn apart, and Mei Gu had momentarily fallen behind. At that moment, a shadowy, twisted, and nauseating figure suddenly emerged from the ground and lunged at Mei Gu.

Having fought against the Sin Abyss for so long, everyone recognized this as a monster conjured by the Shadow Crystal Tower. Someone was secretly manipulating the tower to hunt them down!

At this time, the number of Nascent Soul cultivators in the Twin Mirror Mountain camp was no greater than that of the Two Realms Alliance. Every Nascent Soul cultivator bore heavy responsibilities and immense pressure. Engaged in a struggle against the Two Realms Alliance, they could not afford to divert their attention to the lower-level battlefield.

But once they appeared, they revealed their bloodthirsty fangs!

The group was in a panic, rushing to aid Mei Gu, but the Sin Abyss cultivators had been waiting for this moment. They would not allow them to easily rescue their comrade and immediately launched a frenzied counterattack.

Mei Gu, leading a sect, had struggled and fought her way through many battles, her experience surpassing even that of Fat Chicken and Li Yufu. Finding herself isolated, she showed no signs of panic. She struck at the monster with her Seven Sun Ruler, and a treasure mirror appeared before her chest, shooting a beam of white light directly at the creature.

However, these two attacks were not enough to kill the monster. She bought herself a brief moment, during which Fat Chicken and Li Yufu struggled to repel their opponents. Just then, a streak of light flew toward themâ€”a fierce Kirin beast that tore the monster to pieces in a few swift moves.

The group broke out in a cold sweat and looked up to see a graceful young woman flying toward them.

Recently, I've been adjusting my sleep schedule. Due to a disrupted biological clock, it's been quite challenging. I've found that waking up early leaves me in better condition than staying up late, so I've been forcing myself to sleep before midnight. If I can't finish writing, I get up early to continue, which has made my update times quite irregular. However, I guarantee daily updates.

Please bear with me during this period. I've already seen some progress, and I believe I will eventually conquer my biological clock!
