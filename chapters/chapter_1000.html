<h1>Chapter 992: Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn</h1><p>Qin Sang quickly explained the whole story.</p><p>Yuan Zhu listened with his mouth slightly agape, then suddenly chuckled, leaving Qin Sang bewildered.</p><p>"I was framed by the demon kings of my clan.  I didn't expect that, fellow Daoist, you'd just gone out and were immediately pursued by a Nascent Soul cultivator.  We truly share a similar plight..."</p><p>"A powerful enemy is approaching. Fellow Daoist, this is no time for jokes."</p><p>Qin Sang said helplessly.</p><p>Yuan Zhu's expression turned serious. After pondering for a moment, he asked, "Must you enter the depths of the storm belt to escape?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He was currently within the storm belt, yet Mou Laomo was still hot on his heels. This showed that the outer regions of the storm belt had a limited effect on fire spells.</p><p>Yuan Zhu's eyes flickered as he glanced at Qin Sang. "Why does fellow Daoist believe I possess a treasure that can help you overcome this tribulation?"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>If Yuan Zhu had no solution, he wouldn't have this attitude.</p><p>With the enemy closing in, there was no time to haggle.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a prepared jade slip and tossed it to Yuan Zhu.  "Fellow Daoist Yuan, no matter how precious your treasure is, this cultivation method should satisfy you!"</p><p>The jade slip contained the "Celestial Demon Refining Form," though Qin Sang had only included the first level for now.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's confidence, Yuan Zhu's illusory form paused slightly, then accepted the jade slip, which disappeared into the pillar of light.</p><p>A moment later, a gasp came from the pillar of light. Then, Yuan Zhu's true body flew out and landed before Qin Sang, his expression urgent as he asked repeatedly, "Where did you obtain this cultivation method?  Is there only the first level?"</p><p>"There is indeed more..."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then retorted, "Shouldn't fellow Daoist answer my question now?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu sighed. "Even the most advanced cultivation methods passed down in our Jiao Dragon clan are inferior to this 'Celestial Demon Refining Form.' If I had encountered this method in the past, I would have given everything to obtain it."</p><p>"Although fellow Daoist is afflicted by a secret technique, Jiao Dragon blood still flows within you."</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely, "Fellow Daoist has been curious about how I, a human, could manifest phoenix wings and possess such pure demonic Qi, haven't you?  To be honest, I have already cultivated the 'Celestial Demon Refining Form' to the third level. This method must have been created by a top-tier expert from ancient times. It encompasses all things. Even I, a human, can cultivate it.  Fellow Daoist might be able to find a way to break through your current predicament with its help. Even if you only glean some of its true meaning, it will greatly benefit you, and your future will be promising."</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't mention that he was only able to cultivate the "Celestial Demon Refining Form" because of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Yuan Zhu nodded, not denying it.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Yuan Zhu's tone shifted. "Has fellow Daoist heard of the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros?"</p><p>"Moon Gazing Rhinoceros?"</p><p>Qin Sang searched his memories.  "I once read about it in an ancient text. It seems to have been a remarkable spiritual beast in ancient times, but I'm not sure what abilities it possessed."</p><p>Yuan Zhu explained, "The Moon Gazing Rhinoceros bloodline is extinct; there are no descendants in the Demon Sea. However, our Jiao Dragon clan's records mention that Moon Gazing Rhinoceroses could absorb moonlight during cultivation, and even at noon, when the sun's power is at its peak, it wouldn't affect their cultivation.  No matter where they are, they can sense the power of the moon, which is even more effective than our method of using the stars for navigation..."</p><p>Pausing slightly, Yuan Zhu revealed a secret.</p><p>"In truth, our demon race has been searching for a way to counterattack the Canglang Sea. We not only search for ancient teleportation formations everywhere, but some demon kings have even ventured deep into the storm belt, attempting to cross it and find a passage to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>“The demon race once obtained a broken Moon Gazing Rhinoceros horn. The horn possesses similar abilities to the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros.</p><p>“Our predecessors used fragments of the horn to refine some magical treasures. Powerful demon kings, equipped with Moon Gazing Rhinoceros horns, ventured deep into the storm belt, greatly reducing the risk of getting lost.</p><p>“Unfortunately, they all failed in the end. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been used and reduced to this state.</p><p>“I possess a magical treasure refined from a Moon Gazing Rhinoceros horn.”</p><p>Yuan Zhu stopped keeping him in suspense.  Light flashed in his palm as he retrieved an object.</p><p>This treasure was small, only the size of a thumb.</p><p>It was smooth and mirror-like, emitting a moonlight-like sheen. It was cone-shaped, with a slightly upturned tip, resembling a real rhinoceros horn.</p><p>Hearing the treasure's origin, Qin Sang looked deeply at Yuan Zhu. "Fellow Daoist, to possess such a treasure, your status in the Jiao Dragon clan must be no less than Gu Heng's, right?"</p><p>It seemed there was a reason why Yuan Zhu was alert enough to see through the demon race's conspiracy.</p><p>"The past is like smoke, it holds no meaning anymore. The moment they treated me as a pawn, I severed all ties with the Demon Sea."</p><p>Yuan Zhu said indifferently, "This treasure only has this one ability. It's no longer of much use to me, so I don't mind giving it to fellow Daoist. After all, even if you don't get lost, the storm belt is still filled with countless dangers.  I wouldn't dare enter alone."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy.  He immediately threw another jade slip to Yuan Zhu. "I only have the first four levels of the 'Celestial Demon Refining Form.'  It's enough to cultivate to the late stage of Transformation, which should satisfy fellow Daoist."</p><p>Yuan Zhu took the jade slip and immediately pressed it to his forehead.  After briefly scanning the contents, a look of delight spread across his face.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang mention that the cultivation method was incomplete,</p><p>Yuan Zhu nodded without surprise, a hint of emotion in his voice. "This is a lost world. The most powerful treasures are shattered, and the supreme cultivation methods are scattered..."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. "What does fellow Daoist mean by that?"</p><p>"These aren't my words. They are the箴言 left behind by a Soul Formation stage senior from our Demon Sea..."</p><p>Yuan Zhu gripped the jade slip tightly.  "The 'Celestial Demon Refining Form' must have been one of the supreme demonic cultivation methods in ancient times.  For fellow Daoist to obtain the first four levels is already a great fortune, exceeding my expectations."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.</p><p>Among the top-tier cultivation methods and secret techniques he possessed, the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter," "Celestial Demon Refining Form," "Yin Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art," and "Commanding Thunder Technique" were all incomplete. He had a vague premonition.</p><p>This Soul Formation stage senior from the demon race confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>Not only was the cultivation world fragmented, but even the world's most powerful inheritances and treasures were incomplete.</p><p>The secrets behind this were chilling.</p><p>Yuan Zhu didn't expect that a random thought of his would cause such a stir in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Yuan Zhu held the jade slip. "I'm willing to exchange the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros horn for this cultivation method. However, fellow Daoist must agree to one condition. I have a matter that requires your assistance."</p><p>"What would you like me to do?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu hesitated for a moment. "I can't be distracted right now, and I need to confirm something first. Whether or not I'll need your help is still uncertain. How about this… If fellow Daoist survives this tribulation, come meet me here in ten years, and we'll discuss it further. Rest assured, I won't ask for your help for free; I will offer appropriate compensation."</p><p>With the situation urgent, Qin Sang could only agree.</p>
