<h1>Chapter 927: Second Entry into Seven Kills Palace</h1><p>After discussing matters with Elder Zou, Qin Sang was invited to travel together, but he declined.</p><p>“I'm used to being alone, and I have some personal matters to attend to before going to the Seven Kills Palace. I won't trouble Elder Zou and my fellow Daoists," Qin Sang said with a smile.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance and the West Gloom Alliance definitely had something up their sleeves regarding the Seven Kills Palace, and Qin Sang had been deliberately avoiding contact with them.</p><p>Elder Zou sighed, a strange tone in his voice, "Since you have no intention, Daoist, I won't force you.  After this parting, I don't know if we will meet again. Take care, Daoist."</p><p>"Take care, Elder Zou!"</p><p>Qin Sang solemnly cupped his hands in farewell.</p><p>After parting ways with Elder Zou, Qin Sang frequented shops and auction houses, spending a large amount of spirit stones purchasing treasures for various purposes. Three days later, he left Sky Fortune Island alone and flew towards East Gate Island.</p><p>Returning to East Gate Island brought back memories of Qin Sang's first entry into the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>The Seven Kills Palace was unpredictable. A safe place one time might be occupied by a group of ferocious beasts the next, or a hidden dangerous ancient restriction could be triggered for some reason.</p><p>However, his current strength far surpassed what it was then. As long as he was cautious enough, the outcome shouldn't be worse than last time.</p><p>Inside the temporary cave dwelling he had rented.</p><p>Qin Sang took out fifteen banner poles and slowly stroked them.</p><p>In Qin Sang's heart, the primary goal of this trip into the Seven Kills Palace was not even to find the ancient teleportation formation, but to subdue the Nine Nether Demonic Flame and refine the Eighteen Demonic Banners.</p><p>As a refining master, he was very aware of the value of top-grade magical treasures. If he missed this opportunity, he might not have a second chance to obtain a top-grade magical treasure, even after reaching Nascent Soul.</p><p>With the Eighteen Demonic Banners in hand, even if he couldn't find his way back, at least his strength wouldn't be lacking, and he would have the ability to seek more opportunities.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and a contemplative look appeared on his face.</p><p>He remembered the Flying Night Devil, still in the Ghost Lands, and wondered how it was doing.</p><p>Losing his strongest refined corpse to the lonely ghosts and wild spirits in the Ghost Lands was something Qin Sang hadn't anticipated. Every time he thought back on it, he felt a little annoyed.</p><p>That ghost's strength shouldn't be too strong, otherwise it wouldn't have needed to be so sneaky and could have directly attacked him instead. However, it seemed to possess intelligence, knowing how to shield the soul mark he had left on the refined corpse. He couldn't afford to take it lightly.</p><p>The existence of such a ghost in the Ghost Lands, which had been sealed by the Nine Nether Demonic Flame for who knew how many years, was intriguing. Some kind of mutation might have occurred.  Ghost cultivators did have longer lifespans than normal cultivators, but it couldn't be this absurd.</p><p>It seemed there were still secrets hidden in the Ghost Lands that he hadn't discovered.</p><p>Back then, the Sky Eye Butterfly hadn't yet reached the third transformation, and its Sky Eye hadn't opened. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been played around with.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly had advanced to the mid-stage of the third transformation, and its innate ability had further improved. This time was the right moment for revenge. As long as that ghost dared to show itself, it would be completely exposed under the Sky Eye.</p><p>Retrieving the refined corpse was secondary. After all, a refined corpse that was only comparable to early Nascent Soul cultivation was no longer of much help to him.</p><p>He absolutely couldn't be disturbed while refining the demonic banners and collecting the Nine Nether Demonic Flame.</p><p>He needed to gradually extract the power of the Nine Nether Demonic Flame and seal it within the demonic banners.  Even a small mishap could cause the demonic flame to erupt, backfiring on him.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a while, then put away the banner poles, calmed his mind, and entered meditation, waiting for the final moment to arrive.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang had stayed on East Gate Island for a month.</p><p>During this time, more and more cultivators gathered here, but the lack of news about the opening of the Seven Kills Palace made everyone anxious.</p><p>Half a month later, Qin Sang, who was cultivating in his cave dwelling, was startled awake by a powerful aura.</p><p>Having revisited this place, he knew the time had come. He stopped his cultivation technique, quickly gathered all his belongings, and carried the stone coffin containing his external avatar on his back.</p><p>As soon as he flew out of the cave dwelling, he heard a voice from above, "The Seven Kills Palace will open at midnight tonight. Fellow Daoists, please be prepared."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and he transformed into a streak of light, flying out of East Gate Island. After making a large detour, he headed towards the storm on his own.  Along the way, his escaping light was inconspicuous, very low-key.  Midnight was still a while away, and there was plenty of time.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang reached the storm barrier once more.</p><p>Seeing the scene within the storm again, he was still awestruck.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how the cultivation world had become like this, and what methods those great powers had used to leave behind the barrier, isolating the storm and protecting their descendants for so long.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, then his forehead shimmered as he summoned the Ebony Sword.</p><p>With sword light shrouding his body, he unhesitantly passed through the barrier.</p><p>Just as he entered the storm, a grey hurricane rushed towards him.  Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, and his sword light flashed, instantly shifting him dozens of feet.</p><p>The hurricane brushed past him, but the giant waves it brought were like a sky-covering curtain, unavoidable.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang's sword light intensified, piercing through the terrifying impact and passing through the waves.</p><p>His strength was now far greater than before, and he dared to travel alone in the outer reaches of the storm.</p><p>But facing the main body of the hurricane, he still felt a sense of fear.  He had no doubt about the hurricane's power. If he were swept away by it, even if he could barely escape, he didn't know where he would end up.</p><p>Lost in the depths of the storm, it would be almost impossible to find the way back, and the outcome was predictable.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang slowed down and traveled with his sword.  He maneuvered between the gaps in the hurricanes, following the guidance of the jade talisman, flying towards the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>The journey was quite smooth.  Seeing that he was almost halfway there, Qin Sang suddenly frowned slightly and stopped his escaping light.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The raging wind and giant waves were earth-shattering, drowning out all other sounds.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in mid-air, urging his protective sword qi to resist the wind and waves, turning his head to look to the left.  At the edge of his vision, there were two figures also stopped there. Due to the wind and waves, they were somewhat unclear, appearing and disappearing.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also felt their gazes, seemingly hostile.</p><p>"Xiang Yi said that there would be villains hiding in the storm, waiting to take advantage of the chaos. Could it be that I've really encountered them?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, and a sneer appeared on his masked face.</p><p>The two sides confronted each other for a while. Seeing that the other party made no move, Qin Sang nudged his Ebony Sword, and it shot through the air.</p><p>Only after Qin Sang left did the two figures approach one after another.</p><p>"He's gone!"</p><p>One of them scanned the area, finding that Qin Sang's traces had disappeared, and couldn't help but beat his chest and stamp his feet, complaining, "Brother, we finally encountered someone alone. Why didn't you let me make a move?"</p><p>The other person, wearing a ghost-faced mask, stared in the direction Qin Sang had disappeared, and said in a deep voice, "Anyone who dares to travel alone in the storm is not someone to be trifled with.  This person's escaping light was steady and undisturbed, definitely not an ordinary person.  I sensed a hint of danger from him.  I suspect that if we really attacked him, we might regret it."</p><p>"Is he really that strong?"</p><p>The other person was startled upon hearing this.  "Fine! I'll listen to you, brother. Let him go!  The feng shui here isn't good. Let's change locations. We must make a deal today."</p><p>Chapter Nine Hundred and Twenty-Seven: Second Entry into the Seven Kills Palace</p><p>After discussing with Elder Zou, Qin Sang was invited to travel together, but he declined.</p><p>“I'm used to being alone, and I have some personal matters to attend to before going to the Seven Kills Palace.
