<h1>Chapter 1544: Lu Zhang of Mount Unremembered </h1><p>A gentle breeze rustled through the bamboo grove, the 'shasha' sound drifting into the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang, now the host, sat high in the grandmaster's chair.</p><p>Zhou Jin stood respectfully behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Xie An stood in the middle of the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang invited him to sit, but Xie An only said he dared not.</p><p>Hearing the serene wind from outside, Xie An's anxious heart found no relief, desperately signaling Zhou Jin with his eyes, hoping for a hint.</p><p>Zhou Jin stared straight ahead, also somewhat uneasy.</p><p>Because the one who came with him wasn't Qin Sang's true body, but an avatar, going by the alias Daoist Qingfeng.</p><p>Unaware of the details, Zhou Jin assumed Qin Sang had simply altered his appearance. He pondered Qin Sang's purpose; could he truly be planning a direct confrontation with the Xie Family and the Six Voids Sect?</p><p>Limited by his cultivation, the information Zhou Jin had gathered on the Six Voids Sect was superficial, unable to touch upon their core secrets. Yet, he could still deduce certain things from the clues.</p><p>The Six Voids Sect occupied several counties in Zhuozhou, preventing Mount Unremembered's influence from reaching the county seats. This was likely beyond the capabilities of just three Nascent Soul elders. Offending the Six Voids Sect could very well provoke some colossal entity.</p><p>Such was the Central Plains, with its intertwined and complex factions, constantly vying for power and maintaining a delicate balance.</p><p>The surface appeared calm, yet undercurrents surged beneath.</p><p>Qin Sang's deliberate concealment of his identity suggested even he wasn't entirely confident. Would they, these mere pawns, be discarded?</p><p>Qin Sang paid no mind to Zhou Jin's thoughts and glanced at Xie An.</p><p>Xie An's condition couldn't escape Qin Sang's discerning eyes. This man wasn't unable to form his Gold Core, but had suffered grievous injuries, knocked down from the Gold Core stage. A hidden wound lingered within him, preventing his cultivation from recovering.</p><p>Qin Sang casually asked, "Has the Xie Family yet to open the Clear Void Illusion Realm?"</p><p>These words struck Xie An like a thunderbolt.</p><p>His pupils dilated, his face filled with terror.</p><p>The Clear Void Illusion Realm was the Xie Family's most guarded secret, unknown to anyone outside the family. He himself only learned of it upon inheriting the position of Clan Head, from the previous Clan Head, who also implanted a suicidal restriction in his Nascent Soul to prevent soul-searching.</p><p>Neither the Luo Smoke Sect nor the Six Voids Sect behind them knew of the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>Who exactly was this person?</p><p>Xie An's back was instantly drenched in cold sweat. The wind blowing through the forest chilled him to the bone, a wave of coldness surging from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. His body stiffened, completely losing his composure.</p><p>He didn't know how to answer, much less dare to deny.</p><p>This secret was the Xie Family's sole hope for revival.</p><p>The Xie Family had confirmed that the Clear Void Illusion Realm wasn't destroyed, but closed for unknown reasons.  After being driven from Mount Pu by the Luo Smoke Sect, the Xie Family endured humiliation and never gave up.</p><p>Once they found a way to open the Clear Void Illusion Realm, they would plot their return to Mount Pu. However, no one knew how long it would take.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped teasing the junior, "This Daoist is acting on another's behalf. This person has deep ties to your Xie Family and has entrusted me to help you return to the Clear Void Illusion Realm."</p><p>Hearing this, Xie An froze, the terror on his face replaced by astonishment.  He blurted out, "Which ancestor might this be?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled without answering.</p><p>Xie An dared not press further, his mind regaining some clarity. Thoughts raced through his head, recalling the last words of past Xie Family ancestors, yet he couldn't pinpoint who it could be.</p><p>This person had directly mentioned the Clear Void Illusion Realm; the secret could no longer be kept.</p><p>Moreover, this person was a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, capable of annihilating the Xie Family with a flick of his wrist.</p><p>Whether this person's words were true or false, the Xie Family had to choose to believe!</p><p>Xie An gritted his teeth, his mind made up. He bowed, "This junior cannot make this decision alone. Could Senior grant us a few days? The Grand Elder is currently away from the clan. This junior will contact him immediately."</p><p>Zhou Jin revealed a surprised expression. He had investigated the Xie Family's background but hadn't known of this mysterious Grand Elder.</p><p>Qin Sang found it normal. If the Xie Family hadn't hidden their strength, they would have been devoured by the Luo Smoke Sect long ago.</p><p>"No matter!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, not in a hurry.</p><p>Xie An quickly exited the hall and returned shortly after, presenting the clan's ancient texts as Qin Sang requested.</p><p>The avatar remained at the Xie Family.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang's true body was infiltrating the prefectural office of Fudù County.</p><p>Inside the prefectural office.</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone in a quiet room, savoring a cup of fragrant tea.</p><p>A flurry of hurried footsteps approached from outside. Moments later, a slightly plump cultivator entered, his face beaming with smiles, "Reporting to Senior, the message has been sent back to the sect as you requested. This junior has marked it as urgent, ensuring it reaches Elder Lu. As for whether his esteemed self will come to the appointment, that is not for this junior to decide."</p><p>This person was the Prefect of Fudù County.</p><p>He hailed from Mount Unremembered.  With his path of cultivation seemingly at an end, he was dispatched to the county seat to serve as Prefect. He should have been burdened with trivial matters, responsible for maintaining order and educating the populace.</p><p>Alas, Fudù County was under the Six Voids Sect's control. As Prefect, he was trapped in the county seat, like a caged bird, his position nominal, unable to exercise his ambitions.</p><p>However, with Mount Unremembered's prestigious name protecting him, no one dared to do anything to him.  Free from burdens, the Prefect found contentment in his situation.</p><p>Qin Sang's sudden visit, revealing his Nascent Soul cultivation and requesting a meeting with an elder of Mount Unremembered, was naturally not something the Prefect dared to refuse.</p><p>Elder Lu was the Enforcement Elder of Mount Unremembered, holding a high and influential position.</p><p>Qin Sang set down his teacup and smiled, "Thank you for your trouble, Prefect."</p><p>The Prefect repeatedly said it was no trouble at all.</p><p>"I do not wish for outsiders to know of today's events."</p><p>Qin Sang's smile vanished as he glanced at the Prefect, his figure disappearing into thin air.</p><p>After a long while.</p><p>The Prefect shuddered, that terrifying gaze haunting his every blink.  Restless and fidgety, he muttered incessantly, "Troubled times! Troubled times!"</p><p>...</p><p>Three days later, a white-bearded elder quietly entered the Xie Family and followed Xie An to meet Qin Sang.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this Grand Elder was indeed a Gold Core cultivator.</p><p>"This junior, Xie Qian, greets Senior!"</p><p>The elder's voice boomed like a bell, his aura clearly stronger than Xie An's. Facing Qin Sang, he remained composed, "This junior is late, causing Senior to wait. I hope Senior will forgive me."</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized him and said indifferently, "You are surely aware of the circumstances. This Daoist intends to help the Xie Family reclaim their ancestral land. What are your plans?"</p><p>Xie Qian hesitated, "This junior is incompetent and does not know how to repay Senior's great kindness. Also, the Luo Smoke Sect would certainly not dare to defy Senior's will, but the Six Voids Sect..."</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted Xie Qian, his tone flat, "This Daoist is acting on another's behalf and requires no repayment from the Xie Family. After the Clear Void Illusion Realm is opened, this Daoist only needs to borrow it for a period of time for secluded cultivation. As for the Six Voids Sect, this Daoist has his own methods. If there are no other questions, you may go and make your preparations."</p><p>Such simple conditions!</p><p>Xie Qian and Xie An exchanged glances, both finding it hard to believe.</p><p>Perhaps this Senior wasn't deceiving them and truly represented the legacy of an ancestor.</p><p>"We obey Senior's decree!" they said in unison.</p><p>With a Nascent Soul decree hanging over them, the Xie Family dared not refuse. Whether it was throwing themselves into the fire or not, there was only one path to take.</p><p>Fortunately, foreseeing the Luo Smoke Sect's malicious intentions, the Xie Family had sent a branch far away to live incognito, ensuring the continuation of their bloodline.</p><p>Even if Xie An's branch perished, their lineage would survive.</p><p>It was a crisis.</p><p>But it could also be the Xie Family's opportunity!</p><p>...</p><p>On this day.</p><p>Several disciples of the Luo Smoke Sect guarded the mountain gate, their expressions unconsciously growing tense as they watched the constant stream of escaping lights.</p><p>"Senior Brother Wu, Elder Zhou values you so much, you must have heard what's going on, right? Why does the sect seem to be on high alert? They've spared no spirit stones to activate the mountain protection formation, even the Sect Master and several Grandmasters have emerged from seclusion, making several trips out these past few months. Has something happened in the cultivation world?"</p><p>A young, naive girl couldn't contain her curiosity and, seizing the opportunity, whispered to the young man beside her.</p><p>The other disciples also looked over, echoing the girl's curiosity.</p><p>Flattered by his junior brothers and sisters, Senior Brother Wu felt a sense of pride. He glanced around and whispered, "I overheard something a few days ago while helping Elder Zhou refine pills. You mustn't spread this.  A few months ago, a Nascent Soul Grandmaster was said to be undergoing tribulation nearby.  Suddenly, a mysterious Nascent Soul appeared in the vicinity.  How could the Sect Master and the others not be worried?"</p><p>"A Nascent Soul Grandmaster!"</p><p>The disciples gasped in unison, unable to imagine such an exalted figure.</p><p>The Luo Smoke Sect's strength allowed them to dominate the region, yet they hadn't produced a Nascent Soul Grandmaster of their own.</p><p>"The legendary Heavenly Tribulation! Did that Senior succeed in their tribulation?"</p><p>The girl's face was full of longing, her hand on her chest, her voice filled with excitement.</p><p>"How would I know?"</p><p>Senior Brother Wu shrugged. "Didn't we see several seniors from the Six Voids Sect a while ago? It must have been because of this.  They probably didn't find anything, otherwise, the sect would have returned to normal by now."</p><p>"That's true..."</p><p>The disciples nodded in agreement, murmuring amongst themselves.</p><p>Just then, a sharp whistling sound suddenly came from below the mountain.</p><p>The disciples straightened up, looking towards the source of the sound, and were instantly stunned.</p><p>A dark mass of people flew up the mountain, aggressive and clearly hostile.</p><p>The Xie Family and the Luo Smoke Sect were at odds, their disciples often clashing. Senior Brother Wu easily recognized several familiar faces.</p><p>"The Xie Family!"</p><p>Senior Brother Wu exclaimed, immediately crushing a warning talisman and shouting, "The Xie Family is attacking the mountain!"</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The talisman shattered, shooting a signal flare into the sky.</p><p>Fog billowed from the mountain gate, converging towards the center, sealing it shut as the mountain protection formation fully activated.</p><p>In an instant, the entire Luo Smoke Sect was roused.</p><p>Escaping lights shot out from the mountain, rushing towards the gate.</p><p>A gray-robed cultivator arrived first. Seeing the scene at the mountain gate, his expression changed drastically, and he roared, "Xie An, you are audacious! Leading the Xie Family to besiege my mountain gate without cause, what are your intentions?!"</p><p>Xie An landed in front of the mountain gate and waved his arm.</p><p>The Xie Family disciples arrayed themselves before the Luo Smoke Sect's gate, their weapons pointed directly at them. Hearing such shameless words, they were filled with righteous indignation, their eyes blazing with fury, curses pouring forth.</p><p>Xie An sneered, "Everyone in Fudù County knows that Mount Pu was originally the ancestral land of my Xie Family! Your Luo Smoke Sect relied on your strength to bully us, seizing our cave abode.  You still have the audacity to question me? Shameless!"</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator was momentarily speechless.  He naturally knew the truth and for a moment, didn't know how to retort.</p><p>With the Xie Family's decline, the Luo Smoke Sect had long considered Mount Pu their own.</p><p>He never expected the Xie Family would dare to attack them, it was sheer madness.</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator snorted, about to unleash a torrent of abuse, when he suddenly saw the Sect Master approaching and hurriedly bowed, retreating to the side.</p><p>The Sect Master of the Luo Smoke Sect, surnamed Mo, wore a blue robe.</p><p>A man's reputation preceded him.</p><p>Seeing Sect Master Mo emerge from the fog, not only did the Luo Smoke Sect fall silent, but the clamor of the Xie Family disciples outside also unconsciously subsided.</p><p>Faced with the Xie Family's siege, Sect Master Mo showed no anger.  His eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze passing directly over Xie An to fix on Xie Qian behind him. He scoffed, "Old Ghost Xie Qian, you're still alive."</p><p>"With our ancestral land in the hands of others, how can I face the ancestors of the Xie Family?"</p><p>Xie Qian stepped forward, his aura erupting, confronting Sect Master Mo head-on.</p><p>However, his cultivation was inferior, his aura clearly weaker.</p><p>Sect Master Mo laughed instead of becoming angry, "That day, the Six Voids Sect bore witness. Right and wrong have their own judgment. I'm too lazy to engage in pointless arguments with you. Have you truly thought this through?  With just these old, weak, and injured, do you truly wish to start a war...?"</p><p>Mid-sentence, Sect Master Mo suddenly noticed Qin Sang's avatar standing on Xie An's other side.</p><p>The more he looked, the more he felt something was amiss. He hadn't noticed this person's presence before, completely overlooking him.</p><p>His voice trailed off.</p><p>Sect Master Mo stared intently at Qin Sang, a look of horror gradually creeping into his expression.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang stepped forward.</p><p>A seemingly casual step, and despite the mountain protection formation separating them, the hearts of everyone in the Luo Smoke Sect, including Sect Master Mo, jolted as they all involuntarily took a step back.</p><p>"Sect Master Mo is right, right and wrong have their own judgment.  Since the Six Voids Sect bore witness back then, they should also judge who is right and who is wrong now."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang turned slightly and gestured with his hand, "Why doesn't Sect Master Mo send someone to invite the fellow Daoists of the Six Voids Sect?  This Daoist eagerly awaits."</p><p>...</p><p>Fudù County, with its interconnected mountains and rivers, possessed breathtaking scenery.</p><p>The sky was clear and boundless.</p><p>Yet, a white cloud sped across the vast expanse.</p><p>Two figures stood upon the cloud, revealing it to be a flying treasure.</p><p>Both appeared young.</p><p>One wore sturdy attire, a wooden plaque bearing the words "Enforcement Hall" hanging from his waist.  His brows were sharp, his bearing dignified and imposing. The other appeared much more ordinary, clad in plain Daoist robes, his expression serene, his aura peaceful, his eyes closed in meditation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the white cloud soared over mountains, rivers, and lakes, its flight remarkably smooth.</p><p>The young man in sturdy attire stood at the edge of the cloud, gazing at the scenery below, and softly said, "Elder Lu, we are approaching the county seat of Fudù County."</p><p>His demeanor was extremely respectful.</p><p>For despite appearing to be of similar age, the other was the renowned Enforcement Hall Elder of Mount Unremembered – Lu Zhang!</p><p>Lu Zhang not only held a high and powerful position within Mount Unremembered, but he was also a Mid-Nascent Soul expert, rumored to be the most likely candidate to become a Grand Patriarch in Mount Unremembered's current generation.</p><p>Lu Zhang didn't respond, remaining silent.</p><p>The young man in sturdy attire dared not show any impatience, standing quietly by the side.</p><p>Just then, Lu Zhang suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp glint flashing within.  He rose to his feet.</p><p>The young man was startled.  Before he could comprehend what was happening, he was violently flung away by a powerful force, Lu Zhang's shout ringing in his ears, "Retreat quickly!"</p><p>The young man barely managed to stabilize himself, only to discover, in horror, a raging gale had suddenly erupted in front of the white cloud.</p><p>A terrifying fluctuation surged skyward from the mountains below.</p><p>The wind howled as the power rapidly converged towards the center, moments later coalescing into an illusory human figure.</p><p>"Divine Sense Manifestation!"</p><p>The young man gasped.</p><p>The figure spoke, its voice booming like thunder.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, this Daoist has been waiting for a long time. Why not come down for a chat?"</p>
