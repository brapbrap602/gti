Chapter 486: Flying Rakshasa


The creation of a Flying Rakshasa corpse is roughly a four-step process:  Imbuing the demonic core, merging the human and demonic core, the earth煞 energy surge, and finally, the evolution of the corpse core.
The most dangerous steps are imbuing the demonic core and the earth煞 energy surge.
When imbuing the demonic core, the corpse being created might not be able to withstand the core's power, leading to loss of control of the energy sea, bodily collapse, and explosion.
Even if this step is successfully navigated, one cannot relax.
Merging the human and demonic cores demands even more from the creator. In this step, Qin Sang must perform countless extremely complex hand seals to help the corpse and demonic core fuse.  There can be no pause.
The key lies in spiritual awareness.
Insufficient spiritual energy can be supplemented with pills.  However, if spiritual awareness is depleted midway, one can only helplessly wait for failure.  Thanks to the refinement from the "Chapter on Cultivating the Soul Sword," Qin Sang's spiritual awareness surpasses that of cultivators at the same level, making this step the least of his worries.
The earth煞 energy surge forms a煞 core.  A single misstep could trigger a violent conflict between the earth煞 energy and the demonic core, causing the demonic core to explode.  Qin Sang is so close that he would inevitably be affected; if not killed, he would lose half his life.
Once the煞 core forms, the most dangerous phase is over.  It only remains to evolve the煞 core into the corpse煞 core belonging to the created corpse, and the Flying Rakshasa will be complete.
Beyond this, there's a hidden danger after the Flying Rakshasa is created—corpse backlash!
A corpse suddenly elevated to a Flying Rakshasa is difficult for even a False Core cultivator to control, making the risk of backlash extremely high.
Before creating a Flying Rakshasa, Tian Shi Sect disciples must prepare thoroughly.  When the corpse bares its fangs, they must first suppress it, continuously reinforcing the soul imprint, and slowly subdue the corpse using the soul imprint, bringing it back under control.
Qin Sang doesn't need this; the jade Buddha also strengthens his soul imprint.
If the difference in strength between him and the corpse is too great, it wouldn't work, but now that's not a concern.  Even if the corpse is enhanced to a Flying Rakshasa, it cannot break free.
This saves Qin Sang a lot of time.
The jade box opens.
Qin Sang taps his fingers, disarming the restrictions within.
Powerful demonic energy, carrying an icy chill, surges out.
According to Manager Bao, this demonic core comes from a early-stage Ice Lizard. The core's icy chill is distinctly different from the Yin chill of the earth煞 energy.
The combination is such that even Qin Sang feels his body freezing.

First, he sets Yu Hua aside.
Qin Sang draws the demonic core before him, supporting it with his right hand, focusing his mind on it.
The demonic core's beauty represents immense power, representing the ultimate beauty of transformation through the Dao, something difficult to describe in words, causing one to be mesmerized.
Qin Sang focuses his gaze, steadies himself, and carefully probes with his spiritual awareness, sensing the core's aura.
After some time, Qin Sang becomes thoroughly familiar with the demonic core.  He suddenly beckons Yu Hua with a finger.  At that moment, a 'thread' seems to fly from Yu Hua's body, drawn by Qin Sang toward the demonic core.
From this step begins the secret method of creating the Flying Rakshasa. The 'thread' is actually the manifested corpse restriction on Yu Hua. Qin Sang must use the restriction to let the demonic core and the corpse become 'familiar' first.
As Qin Sang manipulates it, the 'threads' on the demonic core surface gradually weave into a 'net.' The demonic core initially resists strongly, but with time, it seems to begin accepting it.
"Go!"
Qin Sang gently pushes the demonic core forward.
The demonic core drifts toward Yu Hua, landing precisely at the dantian.
At this time,煞 energy boils in Yu Hua's dantian, as if a black hole has appeared.
As the demonic core is about to enter the dantian, Qin Sang's mind tenses, his eyes fixated on the core.
'Whoosh!'
The demonic core slowly sinks into the煞 energy.
At that moment, Qin Sang's expression changes. He discovers that, stimulated by the demonic core, the煞 energy and spiritual energy in Yu Hua's energy sea begin to violently fluctuate.
The two forces, originally in harmony, are disrupted by the addition of demonic energy, showing signs of collapse.
Qin Sang acts decisively, immediately withdrawing the demonic core!
While soothing both sides, Qin Sang carefully recalls every detail before attempting again.
Failure follows failure, yet subtle changes occur.


Gradually, the earth煞 energy and Yu Hua's spiritual power lessened their rejection of the demon core, instead coalescing to resist its pressure.

This was good news; only their perfect cooperation could withstand the demon core's might.

The demon core sank inch by inch into Yu Hua's body.

Storms brewed repeatedly, only to be quelled by Qin Sang, until the demon core fully entered Yu Hua's dantian.

Within the energy sea, an ocean of spiritual power and earth煞 energy held a floating demon core, which finally settled in the center.  Suddenly, demonic energy erupted, radiating brilliant light.

At that moment, Yu Hua's features contorted, emitting a strange, ghastly wail filled with terrible pain, contained within the cavern by Qin Sang's pre-laid restrictions.

Qin Sang's expression was tense.  His consciousness swept across Yu Hua, fearing any oversight, before relentlessly pouring spiritual power into Yu Hua to suppress the demon core!

Yu Hua's energy sea was in chaos, the power wildly turbulent. It was like a bottomless pit; Qin Sang's spiritual power quickly depleted. He immediately consumed one spirit pill, then a second, a third…

Qin Sang's eyes were bloodshot as he stared fixedly at Yu Hua.

Finally, the turmoil in Yu Hua's energy sea weakened. The chaotic mixture of spiritual power and earth煞 energy gradually calmed, returning to their respective places. The demon core also subdued its sharpness, floating quietly in the center of the energy sea.

Qin Sang let out a long sigh, slowly withdrawing his spiritual power. After checking on Yu Hua, he immediately entered meditative cultivation.

Having fully recovered, he proceeded to the second step, completing it successfully.

Now, Yu Hua and the demon core seemed intimately connected—a mere illusion.  Only after the demon core was refined into a corpse煞 pill would true integration occur.

The next step, earth煞 assault, was the most perilous!

Qin Sang cleared his mind, resting for a considerable time before daring to begin.

Yu Hua's energy sea transformed into a blazing furnace. The earth煞 energy and spiritual power within, like flames, scorched the demon core.  Under persistent assault, a breach finally appeared in the demon core's demonic energy.

Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang immediately commanded Yu Hua to direct a strand of earth煞 energy towards the demon core.  However, before success, it was repelled by the resealing demonic energy.

Failure was expected; maintaining control was paramount, so impatience was a no-go.

Qin Sang had previously found the solution through repeated failures, so he wasn't worried.

Within Yu Hua's energy sea, a tug-of-war ensued.

Time passed.

Persistence paid off.  Finally, the first strand of earth煞 energy broke through the demonic energy, making contact with and penetrating the demon core!

Immediately, it faced a fierce counterattack and was driven back.

But this was only the beginning.
