<h1>Chapter 758: Following</h1><p>The Demon Sect, the Merchant Alliance.</p><p>What undercurrents surged beneath the seemingly calm surface of the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang couldn't know.</p><p>He cautiously approached, discovering a restriction left by Xiang Yi.  Standing at the edge, he stared at the body of the Pan cultivator and the remains of the earth-splitting lizard.</p><p>The Pan cultivator's eyes were wide open, unseeing in death. His lower body was completely gone, the wound still emanating a strange water-type energy.</p><p>The earth-splitting lizard was also blown into two pieces; the missing section, like the Pan cultivator's lower half, had turned to dust.</p><p>The residual energy on their bodies should be the Water God Thunder that Xiang Yi had mentioned.</p><p>"The leftover power is this strong. The Water God Thunder's power is probably even stronger than my fire pearl. The question is, how many does Xiang Yi have?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious, a flicker of hesitation in his eyes. Then, he carefully retreated.</p><p>He didn't touch anything, lest he leave traces and be discovered by Xiang Yi.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't leave; he remained in place, waiting.</p><p>After a while, he heard voices. Qin Sang held his breath, using sound to locate their position; there were six people.</p><p>"The Liu couple and the sword-wielding youth were rescued."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, listening intently.</p><p>He wondered how Xiang Yi explained things along the way.</p><p>The six people arrived at the edge of the pit. The Liu couple and the sword-wielding youth looked at the two corpses, not surprised, and angrily said, "It's definitely the earth-splitting lizard! Was this person really a Demon Sect spy?"</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded. "Almost certainly. Before we left, the Merchant Alliance warned me to be careful. I deliberately didn't explain the full mission, just in case.  But I didn't expect this person to be so cunning, to be able to act under everyone's noses and attract the Purple Star Hawks. It's a pity about Daoist Qingfeng; we searched for so long without finding him. I'm afraid the worst has happened."</p><p>Madam Liu exchanged a glance with her husband and sighed. "When the earth-splitting lizard and the Purple Star Hawks attacked, I noticed that Daoist Qingfeng was in the worst position. He was directly thrown into the beast horde, with no time to react before being overwhelmed by the Purple Star Hawks. Daoist Qingfeng's escape techniques are excellent, but they couldn't be fully utilized when surrounded. His cultivation was simply too low. My cultivation is similar to his, and faced with both beasts and poisonous mist, I quickly felt overwhelmed. If my husband hadn't rescued me in time, I might have…"</p><p>Madam Liu's expression was somber, tinged with fear.</p><p>Mr. Liu embraced his wife, comforting her for a few moments before saying gravely, "Even so, we can't be so quick to assume Daoist Qingfeng is dead. The beasts are gathering, and we haven't explored the entire area. Don't forget Daoist Qingfeng not only excels in escape techniques but is also skilled in corpse refinement. There might still be a chance. In this perilous land, one more person means one more chance to survive the crisis. We can't give up on him so easily. After we recover, we will work together to search for him again. Xiang, is there still enough time with the Bone Lotus?"</p><p>Cui Ji and the richly dressed fat man remained expressionless.</p><p>Xiang Yi pondered for a moment, then nodded slightly. "Daoist Liu is right. In that case, everyone should quickly meditate and recover. Before, we had plenty of time, but after this incident, we're running short. You've all experienced the terror of being engulfed by a beast horde. Even Daoist Liu and I couldn't have lasted long without the Bone Lotus's protection. We'll go to rescue Daoist Qingfeng; we have at most the time of two lotus petals. We'll do our best and leave the rest to fate."</p><p>At this point, everyone was severely depleted, their true essence almost exhausted.</p><p>The sword-wielding youth sat cross-legged, frowning. "Xiang, can you explain the mission now?  Are we going to be inexplicably subjected to another beast siege?"</p><p>Xiang Yi didn't hesitate. "I kept it hidden to guard against spies, but now there's no need for secrecy. This stone hall is the first stage. There are three similar stone halls in the Purple Mist Wasteland. It's said that the other two are similar to this one, only separated by restrictions; the danger isn't great. We just need to open the three stone halls and then go to a place resembling an ancient divine altar, and we can leave the Purple Mist Wasteland…"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang eavesdropped in the shadows.</p><p>He didn't know how Xiang Yi explained it, but it seemed the Liu couple and the sword-wielding youth believed his story.</p><p>Hearing Xiang Yi explain the entire mission, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>At the other two stone halls, without a second person to disrupt things, there would probably be no chance for revenge.</p><p>He considered doing what the Pan cultivator had done – attracting beasts to scatter their formation.</p><p>But after much thought, he deemed the chances slim.</p><p>He wondered what the earth-splitting lizard had done in the Purple Star Hawks' nest to incur such wrath, attracting all those Purple Star Hawks.  Its ability to come and go freely within the wasteland, and the precise timing of its attack, were hard to replicate.</p><p>The final ancient divine altar, even Xiang Yi seemed unclear about what it was like. It might be his only chance.</p><p>His enemies weren't just Cui Ji, but also Xiang Yi and the richly-dressed fat man.</p><p>These three were all stronger than him.  He was confident he could take on anyone but Xiang Yi if he could find them alone.</p><p>Xiang Yi would be a much tougher opponent.</p><p>The power of the Water-Gang Divine Thunder was terrifying.  To kill him, Qin Sang would need to use the Fire Pearl and gain the first strike.  But the Fire Pearl was his strongest weapon.  Compared to revenge, the upcoming Sky Tower journey was far more important.  It would be best to save the Fire Pearl for that, to face whatever dangers lay ahead.  A momentary triumph versus the chance to form a Nascent Soul – the choice was clear.</p><p>Qin Sang, ever patient, lay in wait, biding his time.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the others rested, regaining their strength before returning to the battlefield.  The scene was even bloodier and more dangerous than before.  Their search yielded nothing, and they retreated in disarray.</p><p>"Vanished without a trace..."</p><p>The Liu couple sighed.  "We used to think the tales of the Seven Kills Hall were exaggerated. Now we know they weren't.  Qingfeng Daochang's escape techniques were considered top-tier among Foundation Establishment cultivators, yet he didn't even have a chance to flee.  His body was devoured by the beasts."</p><p>Xiang Yi looked at the bone lotus.  "More than half the petals are poisoned. We haven't much time."</p><p>"Let's go..."</p><p>They glanced back one last time before heading deeper into the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>None of them noticed someone silently trailing behind.</p><p>Even with the poisonous mist obscuring sight and perception, Qin Sang dared not get too close.  The tracking was arduous, but thankfully the six were large targets, and he never lost sight of them.</p><p>The second stone hall was deeper still, reportedly close to a chasm in the heart of the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>Xiang Yi didn't walk in a straight line, but at an angle.</p><p>The poisonous mist was even more potent here.  Qin Sang worried about the fat silkworm, constantly checking its condition.  Seeing it lazily resting on his sleeve, seemingly unconcerned, he nodded to himself in relief.</p>
