<h1>Chapter 2169: Blood Crane</h1><p>“The Outsiders truly hide dragons and tigers!”</p><p>Qin Sang retreated to a distance, sighing inwardly.  Although this person had failed to break through, he was undoubtedly a powerhouse at the peak of the Void Refinement stage.  Such individuals were probably not uncommon among the Outsiders; for example, the Yuanxiang Clan Chief is unfathomable.  Si Huang's performance in the secret realm, considering his status, seemed rather ordinary, I wonder if he's hiding something.</p><p>After the great defeat of the Lu family, Qin Sang had successively obtained treasures, rapidly increasing his strength. Even so, he didn't want to make an enemy of such a strong person.</p><p>“It's a pity I couldn't observe the Heavenly Tribulation of a Unity Stage cultivator…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, shook his head, and continued on his journey.</p><p>After nearly ten days of arduous travel, Qin Sang journeyed east, crossing countless mountains and rivers, drawing closer to the agreed-upon location: Feng Huo Mountain.</p><p>Flying for a while, gusts of hot wind blew in his face. Qin Sang frowned slightly, increasing his speed. Soon, he felt a rolling heat wave. Looking ahead, the earth was a fiery red, magma oozing from the ground, flames raging, seemingly burning through the sky itself.</p><p>Feng Huo Mountain was just ahead.  According to records, the area surrounding Feng Huo Mountain was once beautiful with birdsong and flowers, only Feng Huo Mountain itself being unique.  Now, however, it had become a sea of magma. Some mountain peaks could be seen protruding from the magma's surface, but they too had been scoured by the magma, all life extinguished.</p><p>“Why has it become like this? What happened?  Could it be the radiant light again?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself. Each appearance of the radiant light caused severe destruction, especially outside the secret realm's manor; after the radiant light's rampage, vast swaths of devastation remained.</p><p>At this rate, the entire Sacred Land would be unrecognizable!</p><p>Qin Sang continued flying deeper into the magma. Soon, he saw an extremely steep mountain peak, its shape like a razor, a razor forged in fire.</p><p>Blazing flames encircled the peak, howling incessantly. The peak was fiery red, standing out among the other mountains.</p><p>This mountain was Feng Huo Mountain.</p><p>Seeing Feng Huo Mountain, Qin Sang didn't rush forward. He investigated from a distance, ensuring there were no abnormalities before flying towards it.</p><p>Approaching, the blazing wind brushed against his face. Qin Sang looked it over, but didn't see Chen and Liuli.</p><p>“Haven't they arrived yet?”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to a crack in Feng Huo Mountain's body. The crack was narrow, but there was another world within.</p><p>His figure flashed, passing through the crack's entrance.  Before him, the space suddenly opened up, revealing a circular platform.</p><p>The fiery wind squeezed through the crack, leaving the flames here.  The platform above was filled with raging fire, impossible for ordinary people to withstand.</p><p>Qin Sang circulated his true energy to protect his body, scanning around. He didn't find any markers left by Liuli and the others. It seemed they hadn't arrived yet; he was early, before the agreed-upon time.</p><p>He casually set up a formation at the entrance to dispel the flames and sat cross-legged, waiting. While waiting, Qin Sang couldn't help but ponder his recent experiences.</p><p>The world is unpredictable.  Upon entering the Sacred Land, he encountered successive changes and unknowingly made a powerful enemy.  From now on, remaining aloof was almost impossible.</p><p>His enemy wasn't alone.  To resolve the trouble, he alone wasn't enough; he needed to find allies.</p><p>His cooperation with Si Huang's faction was pleasant and he made a good connection, but his enemy is a close associate of the Si You Clan Ancestor.  It would be good if they didn't hunt him down, let alone help him.</p><p>Anyone who knows the Immortal Child's origin would likely hesitate.</p><p>Yuanxiang Clan Chief, Ji Xia…</p><p>These figures flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He lamented that he had made too few acquaintances among the powerful Outsiders, instead making numerous enemies. Finding an ally was not easy.</p><p>The key was, what could he offer to persuade them to risk incurring the wrath of the Si You Clan Ancestor to help him kill the Immortal Child?</p><p>Currently, Si Lu was seriously injured, leaving Chen and Liuli as his only truly reliable allies.</p><p>Chen's cultivation was at the mid-Void Refinement stage; since he was recognized by Master Ning, his strength should be considerable.</p><p>Liuli hadn't yet broken through to the Void Refinement stage, but she was empowered by Master Ning's Heavenly Emperor Talisman – her strength was unknown.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang thought of the Thunder Palace. If the treasures inside were comparable to the…Pearl, his strength would greatly increase after obtaining them.  Since they didn't dare to confront the Immortal Child, inviting them to raid the Thunder Palace together was a viable strategy.</p><p>Of course, these were all matters for later.</p><p>Qin Sang then thought of Mount Daiyu. Master Ning claimed that the power of the sacred mountain could enhance the domain, whether it was effective against the Void Domain abilities was unknown.</p><p>Having successfully repaired the Da Yu Immortal Mountain, verification will follow.</p><p>Five days passed unnoticed.  There was still no news from Liuli and the others.  As the agreed time drew near, Qin Sang felt a growing sense of unease.</p><p>The deadline had been deliberately extended at Qin Sang's request; otherwise, Liuli's group would already be overdue.</p><p>"Did something happen?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but worry.</p><p>The final day arrived, and still there was no word. Qin Sang was certain something had gone wrong.  They had agreed before their departure that if they couldn't arrive by the deadline, they would send a message.</p><p>Knowing that Liuli and the others were likely in danger, he was helpless. The sacred land was vast; he had no idea where they were and couldn't begin to search.</p><p>After searching nearby without success, Qin Sang could only remain patient and wait a few more days.</p><p>Finally, three days after the deadline, an unusual energy fluctuation appeared near Feng Huo Mountain.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang materialized, his gaze like lightning, fixed on a point in the void. He reached out, and a streak of blood flew from the void into his hand.</p><p>The bloodlight contained a blood-soaked paper crane, radiating an eerie glow.</p><p>From the crane, Qin Sang sensed only one person's aura – a magically created object, clearly a distress signal.</p><p>"Something definitely happened!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.  He vanished, a blue thunderbolt appearing above the lava, cleaving the sky.  The thunder echoed across the heavens.</p><p>Although he tried to conceal it, the scale of the thunder escape was difficult to completely mask.  The urgency of the situation left him no choice.</p><p>The blood crane, head forward, guided Qin Sang.</p><p>Night fell.  The night was dark, starless and moonless.  Qin Sang suddenly felt a pull, looking towards the horizon.</p><p>A bright light appeared in the distant sky, a single star in the blackness.</p><p>"Another beam of light…"</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind. He continued without stopping. By nightfall the next day, Qin Sang felt the blood crane growing restless, knowing they were near.  He deactivated his thunder escape technique and moved forward in stealth.</p><p>The two locations were far apart; the crane must have flown a long way. He could only be thankful it hadn't been intercepted.  He wondered about the pair's situation during that time.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The blood crane suddenly burst into a ball of bloodlight.  The vital essence within was exhausted, the red fading to white, then dissolving silently.</p><p>Without the crane's guidance, Qin Sang stared ahead, his eyes flickering as he pondered before continuing.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang stopped, dropping into a forest.  He saw several red figures approaching – several fire crows.</p><p>These crows were flying together, circling the surrounding mountain ranges, their eyes fixed on the ground, as if searching for something.</p><p>"Caw caw…"</p><p>The crows emitted harsh, raspy cries.</p><p>These were not ordinary beasts. Qin Sang watched them for a while and discovered they possessed the cultivation of a demon core stage but seemed to lack much intelligence, flying along a fixed route, clearly controlled by someone.</p><p>The cultivators in the sacred land were at least at the Void Refinement stage.  What could a few fire crows do?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't need to hide; the crows couldn't detect him.</p><p>Unusual events always indicated something amiss, and Liuli and the others were likely trapped ahead. He remained cautious, using a secret technique to conceal himself and slipped past the crows.</p><p>Leaving the crows' territory, Qin Sang saw another, larger flock of identical birds.</p><p>They patrolled their fixed territory, their calls monotonous, like puppets.</p><p>Qin Sang continued.  The crows became more numerous, their cultivation higher, with the appearance of Transformation Stage leaders.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang found fire oxen on the ground. Fewer than the crows, but all at least at the Transformation Stage.</p><p>With fire crows above and fire oxen below, a dense net covered the area – but they were facing a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang effortlessly infiltrated the area, but paused, frowning at the crows and oxen, then looking back the way he came, his gaze uncertain, as if searching for something.</p><p>"Could it be… a beast formation?"</p><p>Qin Sang's knowledge of beast control was limited, but he had some understanding.</p><p>A certain type of spirit beast cultivator doesn't focus on the cultivation level or intelligence of their beasts. Instead, they specialize in raising large numbers of beasts, forming beast formations for battle.  These formations are essentially mobile spirit arrays, capable of adapting to the battlefield situation.</p><p>While the individual beasts are not strong, their combined power under the cultivator's control is formidable. This is similar to the Thunder Altar at Qingyang, where despite the presence of Golden Core cultivators, Qin Sang was able to help defeat the Grand Attendant.</p><p>The weakness of these cultivators is obvious: destroy their beast swarms.  The difficulty, however, lies in the execution. Once a beast formation is established, it is extremely difficult to overcome.</p><p>The master of these fire crows and fire oxen was incredibly skilled, their actions subtle and undetected. Qin Sang’s discovery of the formation was timely; others might have ventured further, unknowingly falling into the trap.</p><p>Upon discovering the formation, Qin Sang didn't charge in. Instead, he retreated to the edge and circled it, realizing its vast size and the enormous scale of the beast swarm.  If this swarm belonged to a single master, maintaining such a large number of spirit beasts would be incredibly expensive.</p><p>The power of such a formation is directly proportional to the number of beasts, making the situation challenging for Qin Sang.  Liao Chen and Liuli were likely trapped inside, but Qin Sang couldn’t contact them, nor did he know the enemy's identity.  A reckless advance could ensnare him as well.</p><p>Uncertain of Liao Chen and Liuli's condition, Qin Sang couldn't afford to delay.  He decided on a drastic measure.</p><p>Exiting the formation, Qin Sang transformed into a Siyou cultivator, thanks to the remaining effects of the spirit pills given to him by Si Huang. Disguised, he returned to the formation, this time without concealing his aura.</p><p>Reaching the edge, he entered directly, encountering a flock of fire crows.  He feigned discovery of something unusual, making a gesture with his finger; an invisible force bound the birds, pulling them towards him.</p><p>As Qin Sang held a fire crow before him, preparing to examine it, a woman's shout rang out.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed, his gaze sweeping towards the formation's depths.  A streak of light descended, revealing a woman in elegant palace attire.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened in surprise – she was a human cultivator!</p><p>“These fire crows are yours? Why are they blocking my path?”</p><p>Qin Sang stared coldly at the woman, his brow furrowed. “You… are a human cultivator?”</p><p>The woman’s gaze fell on the pearl on Qin Sang's forehead, seemingly unconvinced of his identity.  She replied, “While I am of human descent, I gained entry to the Sacred Land after proving myself. These fire crows are my spirit beasts. I've deployed this formation, and I would ask you to detour.”</p><p>Her tone was calm but firm, leaving no room for negotiation.</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed. “Nonsense! This is unclaimed land. Why should I detour? If the secret realm I seek lies ahead, should I simply watch as you take its treasures?”</p><p>The woman’s eyebrows tightened, her voice sharper.  “We haven't discovered any secret realm here, nor would we compete with you for treasures.  If one exists nearby, you are welcome to explore after we leave. But if you insist on forcing your way through, I will have no choice but to stop you.”</p><p>Qin Sang sized her up dismissively. “Do you think this hastily arranged formation will intimidate me?”</p><p>The woman was also at the Nascent Soul mid-stage, making them evenly matched.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's aggressive stance, the woman sighed.  Siyou cultivators possess unique abilities –  leaving a single companion beast outside allows them to escape at any moment.  This was why Qin Sang dared to be so brazen.</p><p>“I alone may not pose a threat, but I have allies. I know of your formidable abilities, but it is said that after using your translocation technique, your companion beast requires time to recover. We have no quarrel. Wouldn't it be simpler to avoid conflict? Why be so stubborn?”</p><p>Suddenly, the formation erupted with violent winds and powerful pressure, targeting Qin Sang from multiple directions.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face paled, his expression fluctuating between apprehension and reluctance – seemingly ready to retreat, yet unwilling to back down after his boastful words.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang squeezed his fingers, causing all the fire crows to explode in a bloody mist.  Affecting an air of bravado, he glared at the woman, coldly saying, “I remember you!”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang turned and left.</p><p>The woman, having suffered this unwarranted attack, shook her head helplessly.  She released more fire crows and returned to her formation.</p>
