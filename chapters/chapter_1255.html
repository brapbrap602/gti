<h1>Chapter 1247: Blood Soul</h1><p>The basin was far from tranquil. The mist surged and receded unpredictably, shifting endlessly. Yet, these were normal phenomena. Even if there were any anomalies, they were concealed beneath the blood mist and ancient restrictions.</p><p>The fat chicken waited for Qin Sang to make a decision. It was well aware that its meager cultivation was far from sufficient. Venturing down alone, it wouldn’t get far before losing its life.</p><p>After glancing at the sea of blood and the letter left behind, Qin Sang pondered for a moment before leading the fat chicken into the basin. He chose a direction consistent with the letter but didn’t strictly follow the marked route, maintaining some distance instead.</p><p>The sensation upon entering was similar to his previous experience in the Blood River, except for the absence of blood shadows.</p><p>“So cold!” </p><p>Surrounded by sinister energy, the fat chicken couldn’t help but shiver.</p><p>As they descended, the cold grew more intense, surpassing even that of the Blood River, to the point where it began to affect the intruder’s consciousness.</p><p>By the time they reached the bottom of the basin, the fat chicken was barely holding on. Only after Qin Sang enveloped it in his true essence did it feel somewhat better, though it still looked around at the endless blood mist with lingering fear.</p><p>“The ancient restrictions here aren’t too troublesome, but if we go deeper, I might not be able to protect you. Once we’re inside, you’ll return to the Unity Ring. Every so often, I’ll find a safe spot to let you out to activate the Thunder Bead and sense your mother,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>The fat chicken needed to use its innate divine ability to stimulate the thunder power within its bloodline to activate the Thunder Bead, allowing it to sense its mother. This ability was unique to the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon. As long as its mother wasn’t trapped in a pocket realm, ordinary ancient restrictions couldn’t sever the connection between mother and child.</p><p>Thus, the Thunder Bead had to be used by the fat chicken itself; Qin Sang couldn’t do it on its behalf. Though this method was cumbersome, there was no alternative.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings. The blood mist was filled with scattered rocks, and the land was desolate, not a blade of grass in sight. The ground resembled a torn chessboard, crisscrossed with ravines from which blood mist and sinister energy continuously spewed. It was a miracle that this place hadn’t been utterly destroyed.</p><p>There must have been an incredibly powerful seal here once, but now it was in tatters. The remnants of the ancient restrictions, having endured countless years, still posed a grave danger.</p><p>The fat chicken huddled behind Qin Sang, shrinking its head as it took in the terrifying scene.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the path Qing Jun and the others had chosen, then stepped forward. The Ebony Sword flew out from between his brows, hovering inverted above his head, while the Eighteen Demon Banners were concealed in his sleeve. Lightning flickered on his wings, ready to strike.</p><p>After walking a short distance, the Ebony Sword suddenly flashed, slashing out a curtain of sword energy. Immediately after, Qin Sang retreated swiftly with the fat chicken.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of yin wind blew past where they had just stood, turning the rocks into powder. The residual force was blocked by the sword curtain.</p><p>Similar incidents had occurred multiple times.</p><p>Qin Sang navigated through the gaps in the ancient restrictions, dealing with various unexpected dangers, managing to proceed without major mishaps.</p><p>Unconsciously, several hours had passed.</p><p>Apart from necessary rest, Qin Sang had hardly stopped. The basin was vast, and with dangers lurking everywhere, they had to proceed slowly. Calculating the distance, they still had a way to go before reaching the center.</p><p>After walking for so long, they hadn’t encountered a single person.</p><p>By now, cultivators from both regions had been inside for quite some time. Qin Sang wondered if they had run into each other, but he hadn’t sensed any activity.</p><p>The Thunder Bead also hadn’t received any feedback.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang seemed to sense something and suddenly halted, his gaze fixed intently to the left.</p><p>The fat chicken followed his line of sight but saw only thick blood mist, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>“Get in!”</p><p>At Qin Sang’s command, the fat chicken quickly stowed the Thunder Bead and hid in the Unity Ring.</p><p>In the next moment, an ear-piercing, mind-numbing screech echoed through the air.</p><p>The sound was like a demonic chant, causing Qin Sang to frown deeply.</p><p>Then, a dense blood light flashed deep within the mist, and a blood-soaked figure, as if it had just crawled out of a blood pool, floated in mid-air, charging at them with a ferocious expression.</p><p>The screech was filled with malice, a bloodthirsty demon.</p><p>“Not a blood shadow, but a humanoid form. Could it be a blood soul born from the blood mist?”</p><p>This blood soul was the first living creature Qin Sang had encountered since entering. He had expected it to be like the blood shadows in the Blood River, but it turned out to be humanoid.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang felt a flash of blood light before his eyes as the blood soul closed in. Startled, he swiftly slashed with his sword.</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>The Ebony Sword cleaved through the blood shadow, splitting it in two from top to bottom.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after the sword strike, the two halves of the blood soul wriggled and each grew a new body, becoming two blood shadows!</p><p>“An immortal body?”</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his spirit sword and flicked his sleeve, releasing a ball of demonic fire. The fire contracted and expanded, forming a net that enveloped the two blood souls.</p><p>Even this didn’t kill the blood souls. They shrieked and struggled wildly, causing the demonic fire to fluctuate.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly released two more balls of demonic fire.</p><p>Just as the blood souls were about to be burned to death, Qin Sang considered holding back to study them, but the Heavenly Eye Butterfly suddenly warned him. More than a dozen blood souls were being drawn to their location.</p><p>Qin Sang made a swift decision and burned the blood souls to ash.</p><p>After the blood souls died, nothing remained.</p><p>He flashed away, distancing himself from the area.</p><p>The blood souls were incredibly fast, relentlessly pursuing him. In such a place, it was difficult to shake them off. Qin Sang had no choice but to fight as he moved, eventually killing all the blood souls.</p><p>After dealing with the blood souls, Qin Sang looked in the direction they had come from, a hint of hesitation in his eyes. “It seems only that area has blood souls. If I were to be surrounded, I’d be in trouble. That’s the path Senior Sister and the others chose. Could something have happened to them?”</p><p>He considered going to investigate.</p><p>But if even Qing Jun and the Netherworld Demon Lord couldn’t handle it, wouldn’t he be walking into the lion’s den by going alone?</p><p>The basin was more dangerous than he had imagined, and Qin Sang grew even more cautious. Later, he encountered a few lone blood souls, but they were of little concern.</p><p>After pressing on for a while, Qin Sang had just killed another blood soul when he suddenly heard a voice.</p><p>“I wonder which fellow Daoist has arrived?”</p><p>Qin Sang secretly summoned the Eighteen Demon Banners, but the voice was ethereal, making it impossible to determine its source. The other party must have used some technique.</p><p>He activated his Heavenly Eye ability but still couldn’t locate the person’s hiding spot.</p><p>However, aside from his senior sister and the others, the only people here were from the Sin Abyss. The voice sounded somewhat familiar.</p><p>“Is that Fellow Daoist Si?” Qin Sang asked, testing the waters.</p><p>“Oh? Fellow Daoist Mingyue!”</p><p>The other party exclaimed in surprise, his tone filled with delight. Then, the blood mist in the distance churned as a figure flew over—it was Si Di, his long-time partner from the Threefold Pass.</p><p>“We waited for you for a long time and thought you might have run into trouble.”</p><p>From Si Di’s tone, it seemed he had entered with Qing Jun and the others, though it was unclear why he was now alone.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “I shouldn’t have been much later than you, but traveling alone here is troublesome, so I fell behind. Why are you alone here, Fellow Daoist?”</p>
