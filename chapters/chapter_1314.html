<h1>Chapter 1306: Besieged City</h1><p>Chapter 1306: Besieged City</p><p>The Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>This was the moment of the most violent tremors in the Abyssal Ruins; not a single person was visible.</p><p>A crimson streak of light, fast as lightning, shot into the Abyssal Ruins, disappearing into a sea of mist.</p><p>Shortly after, four more streaks of light arrived, namely Master Cang Hong, Fairy Qiu Zhi, and others.  The initial crimson streak was Ye Laomo, fleeing for his life.</p><p>“His goal is the Sinful God Palace!”</p><p>The entrance to the Sinful God Palace lay deep within the mist.</p><p>“Quickly!”</p><p>The four, without hesitation, charged into the mist. Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed from the depths of the mist, deafening and earth-shattering.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a terrifying wave surged outwards, an overwhelming pressure permeating the air.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The mist sea was in complete chaos; countless turbulent currents surged wildly, each with astonishing power.</p><p>This place was already the epicenter of the Abyssal Ruins’ tremors.</p><p>At this moment, the tremors intensified.  The four, all top-tier experts, felt a suffocating pressure. They struggled to maintain their footing, fearing being swept away by the currents and lost in the mist.</p><p>Just then, the four suddenly stopped, staring blankly ahead.</p><p>Through the hazy mist, the shadowy form of a celestial gate gradually emerged.</p><p>The gate was immense, towering to the heavens.</p><p>As the celestial gate appeared, various phenomena manifested.</p><p>However, these phenomena were not auspicious signs, but rather visions resembling the eighteen levels of hellish torment: mountains of knives, seas of fire, pools of blood and lightning – any imaginable horrific punishment was displayed in turn.</p><p>The tortured beings writhed in agony, eternally condemned.</p><p>Though knowing it was an illusion, it was still terrifying.</p><p>The celestial gate slammed shut, revealing a crimson ancient character, ‘Sin,’ in its center.</p><p>Surrounded by these ominous phenomena, the crimson character seemed incredibly blood red!</p><p>The next moment, the celestial gate trembled and, to the four's astonishment, slowly opened a crack.  However, it was not yet time for the Sinful God Palace to appear. With a ‘boom,’ the gate abruptly closed.</p><p>In that split second, an inconspicuous crimson shadow flashed into the gate.</p><p>“Ye Laomo went in!”</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Shan exclaimed.</p><p>The group fell into a stupor, finally understanding why Ye Laomo dared to defy the world – he had a prepared escape route, an absolutely safe sanctuary!</p><p>This was unprecedented in history.  Only when the Purple Micro Palace appeared would the celestial gate of the Sinful God Palace open; no one had ever been able to open it themselves.</p><p>Ye Laomo was the first!</p><p>Until the next appearance of the Purple Micro Palace, no one could pursue and kill Ye Laomo.</p><p>The shadow of the celestial gate gradually faded.</p><p>The four cried out inwardly, rushing toward where the gate had been.  By the time they arrived, the gate had vanished, leaving only a massive vortex of mist.</p><p>Standing at the edge of the vortex, the four wore various expressions, but none dared to enter.</p><p>The vortex was filled with turbulent currents that would easily tear apart anyone who ventured in.</p><p>The entrance to the Sinful God Palace, that celestial gate, usually lay hidden within the vortex.  Only when the Purple Micro Palace appeared, triggering ancient prohibitions, would the gate manifest and open.</p><p>“How did Ye Laomo do it?”</p><p>Master Cang Hong muttered in disbelief.</p><p>They tried to trigger the gate, but no matter what methods they employed, the mist vortex remained unresponsive, showing no sign of the gate.</p><p>The four were somewhat dejected. Ye Laomo had committed countless bloody crimes, yet they were powerless against him.</p><p>“Ye Laomo’s intentions are unclear; we must guard against his return. But the situation in Yu City is urgent.  Qi and the others alone are no match for Zhenyi Laodao.”</p><p>A trace of weariness appeared on Master Cang Hong’s brow. This was a true internal and external crisis; Elder Tian Zheng was severely injured and recovering, leaving him overwhelmed.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Master Cang Hong instructed: “Daoist Shan, you two remain here and keep watch. Fairy, I recall your sect's Heavenly Net Locking Origin Array has the effect of trapping people. Set it up here to prevent Ye Laomo from forcing his way in; it can be used as an emergency measure. Once the situation is clarified, we will make further arrangements.”</p><p>Fairy Qiu Zhi nodded. “I will fetch the Heavenly Net Locking Origin Array disc at once.  Master, return quickly to Yu City to stabilize morale. The chaos in the city will not escape the notice of the Two Realms Alliance; they will certainly not miss this golden opportunity…”</p><p>Seasoned as they were, even faced with unprecedented upheaval, they did not panic, sorting through countless threads, and prioritizing what needed immediate action.</p><p>As Master Cang Hong and Fairy Qiu Zhi flew out of the Abyssal Ruins, they saw a Golden Core stage youth spinning around in a frantic manner, like an ant on a hot pan, his face filled with anxiety.</p><p>Senior, something’s happened…”</p><p>Seeing the two, the young man rushed to them, urgently reporting in a few short sentences.</p><p>Master Cang Hong’s expression drastically changed; his earlier composure vanished completely.</p><p>…</p><p>Yu City.</p><p>The lotus flower had disappeared.</p><p>The city’s protective array was breached!</p><p>The Qi cultivators and their troops retreated into the inner city.</p><p>The outer city, now ravaged by war, lay in ruins, bearing no resemblance to its former prosperity. The armies of the Two Realms Alliance were arriving and assembling there.</p><p>A massive army lay siege!</p><p>The inner city was the original Yu City, containing the intact ancient defensive array, now activated by the Qi cultivators.</p><p>Above the inner city, golden light shone brilliantly as the array formed a golden hemispherical dome, inverted over the city like a turtle shell, firmly protecting it.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance didn’t immediately attack.  All the Yuan Ying stage cultivators gathered to discuss their next move.</p><p>The internal strife within the Abyss of Sin had resulted in the deaths and injuries of more than half their high-level cultivators.  Defeating them was merely a matter of time, but they also had to guard against the Abyss of Sin resorting to desperate measures; they didn’t want to perish on the eve of victory.</p><p>Within the inner city.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin’s Yuan Ying cultivators also gathered in the great hall, but unlike the spirited Two Realms Alliance, the atmosphere was incredibly oppressive.  Especially those who had consumed the Ku Yuan pills and suffered its backlash; their vitality was slowly waning.  Considering their uncertain future and that of their sect, their faces were grim, and they remained silent.</p><p>The Qi cultivator silently observed everyone's demeanor.  He clearly understood that their morale had plummeted and could guess what they were thinking.</p><p>They had initially agreed to actively engage the enemy and personally fight on the front lines to obtain the Ku Yuan pills.  Now, realizing the pills were a trap, what benefit was there in continuing the fight?</p><p>However, the situation had now reversed, with the Two Realms Alliance gaining the upper hand.</p><p>Putting themselves in the other's shoes, if they had been under siege for over a hundred years, they would also want to exact their revenge.  Whether or not the war could cease was no longer their decision.</p><p>The reason no one had spoken up yet was because they were waiting for news from Master Cang Hong.</p><p>A sliver of hope remained: if Master Cang Hong could capture Ye Lao Mo, there might still be a chance to salvage the situation and find a solution to the Ku Yuan pill crisis.</p><p>Of course, capturing Ye Lao Mo alive and forcing him to reveal his plans would be even better.</p><p>Ye Lao Mo had plotted for centuries, manipulating the world and scheming on such a profound level, his motives were far-reaching.  It was likely some unimaginable treasure, or perhaps a chance to break through to the later Yuan Ying stage, or even a higher realm.</p><p>Compared to that, the outcome of this war seemed less important.</p>
