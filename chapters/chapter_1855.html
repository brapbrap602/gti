<h1>Chapter 1846: The Ancient Tree</h1><p>Tianmin Soul Cleansing Incantation!</p><p>Crisis loomed, but the young female Daoist, while responding, kept her eyes fixed on the female Daoist casting the incantation.</p><p>This woman was her master, Ruoquan Zhenren, the old Abbot of the Pure Spring Abbey.</p><p>The young Daoist didn't blink, afraid to miss a single movement of her master's spellcasting.</p><p>This incantation was a secret divine incantation of the Pure Spring Abbey, one that only Grand True People of the Fifth Talisman Rank could skillfully perform.</p><p>She herself had reached the late-stage Soul Cave realm and could barely cast it, but it was extremely taxing. She had to summon her Altar, gather her spirit soldiers, and perform the steps of the Star-Stepping and Dipper-Treading ritual to cast the incantation together.</p><p>Before her master severed her cultivation, she didn't need to array her spirit soldiers or chant the incantation; a raise of her hand was enough. Now, her performance wasn't as effortless as before; she had to chant the true words to invoke spiritual resonance.</p><p>However, this allowed the young Daoist to better understand Ruoquan Zhenren's comprehension of the divine incantation and learn more.</p><p>As for the surrounding danger, seeing her master's calm expression, the young Daoist wasn't worried.</p><p>Unless all the demons and devils within the Purification Platform gathered here to ambush them.</p><p>The incantation transformed into clear spring water, appearing out of thin air like rootless water, encircling everyone.</p><p>No matter how rampant the surrounding polluted Qi, it couldn't approach them.</p><p>Ruoquan Zhenren's divine incantation resolved the immediate crisis for the other True People. These True People were all highly cultivated and battle-hardened individuals. They reacted instantly, and their bodies shimmered with protective light.</p><p>The protective light emanated from each True Person's Altar.</p><p>All four were disciples of Daoist monasteries and abbeys, their cultivation methods inherited from their masters, different from the three Grand Offices of the Dao Court.</p><p>Within the aperture of the young Daoist's Altar was a pool of clear spring water, crystal clear, the true form of the Pure Spring Abbey's true transmission, the Pure Spring Altar's Dharma.</p><p>The other three True People's Dharma were all different. One's Altar manifested cinnabar yellow talismans, another's Altar grew a jade bamboo staff, and the last one's true Dharma form was a golden core the size of a longan fruit.</p><p>Closer observation revealed further differences between the four Dharma.</p><p>The jade bamboo staff was tangible and real, while the other three Dharma forms appeared somewhat illusory. This indicated that the owner of the jade bamboo staff cultivated the Golden Seal Altar, while the other three cultivated the Spirit Soldier Altar.</p><p>All four were sect masters or abbey abbots, qualified to inherit their sect's trained Dao soldiers, hence most cultivated the Spirit Soldier Altar.</p><p>The Altars appeared.</p><p>The three Spirit Soldier Altars roared, their eight gates opening, and ranks of spirit soldiers marched out, filling the air with demonic Qi.</p><p>The True Person cultivating the Golden Seal Altar was not to be outdone.  They pointed two fingers at their Altar, lips moving slightly, no incantation audible, only the jade bamboo staff within the Altar trembling.  Moments later, a brilliant light erupted.</p><p>Within the light, the jade bamboo staff expanded at an astonishing speed, becoming as thick as dozens of people embracing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It wasn't the actual jade bamboo staff expanding; the naked eye could see that the giant staff's surface was carved with dense, strange runes, complex yet orderly, following strict principles.</p><p>Clearly, this True Person was using their Altar to deploy a unique divine talisman.</p><p>Reaching its limit, the giant jade bamboo staff suddenly exploded, countless bamboo shards shooting in all directions.</p><p>The shards weren't meant to harm but flew precisely towards the demonic soldiers summoned by the other True People.</p><p>Each demonic soldier was targeted by a jade-green bamboo shard. In a flash, the shards landed on the soldiers' heads, merging into their bodies.</p><p>The other three True People didn't interfere. Without orders, the demonic soldiers didn't dare resist, allowing the power within the bamboo shards to enter them.</p><p>Having just been summoned, the demonic soldiers were still forming their ranks. As the shards merged, they all emitted identical spiritual light.</p><p>The light connected, becoming one.</p><p>The demonic soldiers belonged to three different True People, but now their Qi blended seamlessly, appearing as one. While their formation seemed somewhat scattered, each 'bamboo shard' was a dispersed formation component. Upon any change, they could instantly combine, forming the soldiers into a divine talisman.</p><p>When the soldiers formed a grand formation, empowered by the bamboo shards, there were also countless benefits.</p><p>The four True People rarely fought together, but now they cooperated with remarkable tacit understanding, complementing each other, leaving no openings for the enemy.</p><p>Among the True People, only Ruoquan Zhenren hadn't summoned her Altar.  Remaining above, she cast incantations to ward off the encroaching pollution. Seeing the demonic soldier formation nearing completion, she slowly descended into the formation.</p><p>Whether the enemy was wary of Ruoquan Zhenren's strength or hadn't found a suitable opportunity to strike, the polluted Qi didn't intensify but showed signs of receding.</p><p>No unusual changes occurred within the polluted Qi either.</p><p>Unsure of the demons' hidden schemes, the True People remained vigilant, awaiting Ruoquan Zhenren's commands.</p><p>Just then, Ruoquan Zhenren's expression shifted, her eyes flashing, she abruptly turned to her right.</p><p>There, turbid waves rolled, no different from elsewhere, but now a few sharp, strange laughs echoed, "Hehe... I wondered who it was, it turns out to be Ruoquan Zhenren of the Pure Spring Abbey. With the Pure Spring Abbey's strength and status, obtaining a Grand True Person position on the Merit Seal wouldn't be easy, would it?  No wonder you're content being the Dao Court's lapdog. My respects! My respects!"</p><p>The voice was sarcastic, and the words carried deeper meaning.</p><p>Hearing this, a strange look flashed in the eyes of the other four True People.</p><p>With their status, they knew some secrets, but not the full story.</p><p>It was rumored that the five Talisman Ranks of the Dao had a fixed quota.  Reaching the required cultivation wasn't enough for a breakthrough.  Forcing a breakthrough would make it difficult to maintain one's position.  War contributions against the Ghostfang Kingdom were one of the criteria for evaluation.</p><p>The young Daoist had just learned the secrets of the Divine Court and the Merit Seal, guessing it was definitely related to the Divine Court's collapse while the Merit Seal remained incomplete.</p><p>Ruoquan Zhenren wasn't angered, her expression unmoved, her voice cold, "This formation can conceal itself from my perception; it must be a Demon King's presence.  Which Daoist friend is here? Why not show yourself and have a chat?"</p><p>The other party only laughed coldly, giving no response.</p><p>The strange laughter gradually faded, the polluted Qi rapidly dissipating, soon vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Ruoquan Zhenren gazed in the direction the laughter had retreated, guessing the enemy's purpose.  This seemingly anticlimactic attack was actually aimed at forcing her to reveal herself and confirm her identity.</p><p>The probing between them had begun, and the Ghostfang Kingdom had won the first round.</p><p>"...Greetings, Senior Ruoquan."</p><p>The True People withdrew their Altars and approached Ruoquan Zhenren to pay their respects.</p><p>The three True People wore different expressions. They had just learned that a Grand True Person had severed her cultivation to enter the Purification Platform.</p><p>What could be so important?</p><p>They didn't dare ask Ruoquan Zhenren directly, constantly casting inquiring glances at the Pure Spring Abbey Abbot.</p><p>Ruoquan Zhenren didn't need to explain anything to them.  She withdrew her gaze and looked towards the former location of the nascent spirit, "Go! See what methods these demons used..."</p><p>With their questions unanswered, the three True People hurriedly followed.</p><p>The nascent spirit had dispersed, and while the auspicious clouds seemed calm, traces must remain.  The True People spread out, searching carefully.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, Wan Zhenren and his group were exploring along their designated route.</p><p>While exploring, they frequently glanced towards the direction where the golden light had faded.</p><p>Wan Zhenren paid close attention to his martial uncle's actions.</p><p>Every so often, the old Daoist would rub the jade talisman in his hand, seemingly sensing something.</p><p>After traveling some distance, Wan Zhenren heard his martial uncle's voice transmission, "Ignore that side."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Acknowledging the order, Wan Zhenren continued searching for the Divine Court.</p><p>...</p><p>Starting with Ruoquan Zhenren's encounter, the Purification Platform gradually became lively.  Similar golden lights appeared periodically.</p><p>There were golden lights and other colored lights, some with immense power, engulfing the entire Purification Platform, even rivaling the one from years ago.</p><p>Others only affected a large area of nearby illusions, appearing and disappearing rapidly.</p><p>These were all orchestrated by both sides, probes and diversions.</p><p>Even knowing that over ninety percent were enemy deceptions, they still had to investigate, and encounters were unavoidable.</p><p>Sometimes, they'd stop after a brief exchange, identifying the enemy and withdrawing.</p><p>Other times, major battles erupted, with victories and defeats on both sides.</p><p>However, the true entrance to the Divine Court remained hidden.  Before finding it, no one was willing to fight to the death.</p><p>...</p><p>"It's happening again!"</p><p>In the flower field, Qin Sang looked up, seeing the crimson glow dyeing the entire poison domain red.</p><p>It was as if a morning sun was rising within the Purification Platform.</p><p>"The ninth time..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He remained in the flower field, counting the occurrences of strange lights within the Purification Platform.  Golden light was the most frequent, appearing six times, crimson glow three times.</p><p>He didn't understand the meaning of these lights, only able to guess the progress of the struggle between the two sides based on the lights' impact.</p><p>The only consolation was that none of these lights affected the illusions as drastically as the golden light from years ago. The flower field remained undisturbed for now.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the origins of the lights weren't fixed and weren't progressively deeper within the platform.</p><p>This suggested that neither side was solely focused on venturing deeper into the Purification Platform.  The treasure could be anywhere within.</p><p>Time slowly passed as Qin Sang counted the occurrences of the strange lights, a torturous wait.</p><p>...</p><p>Several days passed.</p><p>The standoff outside the Purification Platform continued.</p><p>Silence reigned over the battlefield.</p><p>No news came from within the Purification Platform. Both sides' momentum had waned compared to the beginning, their sharpness being eroded by time.</p><p>The covert struggle within the Purification Platform intensified, with casualties on both sides.</p><p>Wan Zhenren's group was fortunate, only encountering a group of demon cultivators two days ago.  They exchanged a few probes from a distance before parting ways.</p><p>They hadn't encountered other demons since.</p><p>In these past days, Wan Zhenren had led the True People through countless illusions, yet the jade talisman in his hand remained unresponsive.</p><p>The strange lights appeared frequently, and the True People numbly followed Wan Zhenren's commands. No one complained.  The discerning ones had already realized the old Daoist's unusual identity, but no one delved into it.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Another wave of golden light swept across the sky, engulfing everyone.</p><p>The True People instinctively braced themselves. As expected, the light reached its peak and then rapidly receded.</p><p>When the golden light dispersed, everyone looked around, their expressions unchanged.  Just as they were about to leave, they noticed the old Daoist standing still.</p><p>"Martial Uncle?"</p><p>Wan Zhenren hurriedly stopped.</p><p>The old Daoist remained silent, his brows furrowed. Suddenly, he asked, "How many times has this been?"</p><p>Wan Zhenren knew his martial uncle was referring to the golden lights orchestrated by the demons. He pondered, "It should be the eighth time."</p><p>"The eighth time..."</p><p>The old Daoist flicked his horsetail whisk, scattering light particles that formed a circular area in front of him.</p><p>In certain locations, the light particles turned golden, very conspicuous, a total of eight spots.</p><p>The eight golden spots seemed randomly placed, with no apparent connection.  But to the old Daoist, there might be a pattern.</p><p>The old Daoist pondered for a long time, his expression shifting slightly. He flicked his whisk again, erasing the circle, "Follow me..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the old Daoist's light sped off like lightning, not towards the depths of the Purification Platform, nor in their original direction, but directly west. His eyes were deep as he continued his deductions while flying.</p><p>The True People exchanged glances, bewildered, but they followed closely.</p><p>As Wan Zhenren and the others sped through the Purification Platform, unbeknownst to them, the demon cultivators were moving systematically.</p><p>The repeated detonations of golden light weren't merely to confuse the Daoists.</p><p>They were using it as a cover to quietly set up a massive formation within the Purification Platform.  While it couldn't directly locate their target, it could help them eliminate certain areas and pinpoint the general location of the target.</p><p>This formation was created by a Great Sage.  Even a Grand True Person at their peak wouldn't easily detect it, let alone now.</p><p>"It's time..."</p><p>Within a shimmering illusion, five demon cultivators hovered above the water, surrounding a scholar in white.</p><p>The scholar appeared refined and elegant, with no outward signs of his demonic nature.  He looked up at the sky and murmured.</p><p>Then, he flicked his sleeve, a golden pearl falling out and landing on the water.</p><p>'Plop!'</p><p>No ripples formed.</p><p>The golden pearl floated silently on the surface.</p><p>The other demon cultivators forced out their essence blood, merging it into the pearl.  A flash of blood-red light vanished, and the pearl seemed to shed a layer of its shell, emitting a golden glow.</p><p>Then, the pearl gradually expanded, its shape changing, transforming into a golden nascent spirit.</p><p>The nascent spirit pulsed, its golden light intensifying, dyeing the entire illusion gold, and rapidly spreading.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the golden light filled most of the Purification Platform, attracting the attention of cultivators and demon cultivators alike.</p><p>They assumed the golden light would recede as before.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when the golden light reached its peak, filling the entire Purification Platform, it didn't fade but continued to intensify.</p><p>Simultaneously, eight illusory nascent spirits appeared in various locations within the Purification Platform, corresponding to the sources of the previous eight golden lights.</p><p>The previously dormant locations, with the appearance of these light spots, instantly resonated with the golden light.</p><p>The last nascent spirit, sensing the resonance, pulsed at an accelerated rate, emitting an even more intense golden light.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A continuous stream of golden light bombarded the Purification Platform, the nine nascent spirits forming a strange formation.</p><p>At this moment, all cultivators and demon cultivators within the Purification Platform sensed the nascent spirit formation.  As the formation solidified, strange fluctuations appeared in a specific area.</p><p>The demon cultivators, their expressions excited, charged towards that area without hesitation.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators' expressions changed, sensing trouble, and rushed towards the same area.</p><p>Within the flower field, Qin Sang also rose from the ground.</p><p>"Is it coming?"</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense, covering the entire flower field, feeling the increasingly violent impact.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The flower field formation trembled, flower spirits danced, and the bones on the ground vibrated.</p><p>This impact had already surpassed the one from years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression gradually eased from its initial gravity.</p><p>Within the illusion where the flower field resided, the bones were the foundation, while the flower field was planted later.</p><p>The bone earth proved to be stable. As long as the foundation of the illusion remained unshaken, the flower field formation could hold.  The previous incident was due to a flaw in the formation, which affected the aperture.</p><p>For now, it seemed he didn't need to relocate the flower spirits.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The external illusions were bombarded by the golden light, awakening one after another, various strange scenes unfolding.</p><p>As both sides' experts, disregarding the danger, were flying, they suddenly felt the Purification Platform tremble violently.</p><p>This tremor, as if the entire platform had jumped, was extraordinary.</p><p>At this moment, including Qin Sang, everyone felt a jolt and looked towards the source of the tremor.</p><p>A golden light, even more dazzling than the nascent spirits, erupted from that location, and the shadow of an ancient tree appeared!</p>
