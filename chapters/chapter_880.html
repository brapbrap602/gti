<h1>Chapter 872: Unfruitful</h1><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang set up multiple layers of restrictions and then a defensive spirit array before feeling relieved.  He then sat cross-legged before his external avatar, pricked his finger, squeezed out some blood essence, and performed the blood-feeding technique. After absorbing the blood essence, the external avatar's face flushed, its aura surging dramatically before gradually stabilizing. Qin Sang opened his eyes, thought for a moment, and as before, squeezed out several more drops of blood, injecting them into his external avatar's body for it to slowly refine.  He then sealed the cave and quietly left.</p><p>……</p><p>Several months later, Qin Sang returned to this sea area. He first returned to the Thunder Island. The island was lush and green; the area where the Kui dragon's blood had splattered was particularly vibrant, the traces of the great battle long since obscured.  Qin Sang appeared before a mountain, gazing far into the distance, recalling the scene. The Kui dragon had come from the clouds; after those people discovered the Kui dragon was under attack, they arrived to support it in a short time, indicating their cave abode couldn't have been too far away.</p><p>In case those people from Black Snake Mountain hadn't left, Qin Sang acted cautiously. He spent over half a month meticulously searching almost every island in the vicinity. To his surprise, he found no trace of them whatsoever.  There wasn't even a single island with a spirit vein, let alone a cave.</p><p>Unsatisfied, Qin Sang kept his Sky-Eyed Butterfly's celestial eye active, conducting an even more thorough investigation, but the result remained the same. The mysterious people seemed to have appeared out of thin air.</p><p>“Did those people come through a teleportation array? Or was the concealment array of their cave abode too powerful, even deceiving the Sky-Eyed Butterfly?”</p><p>Qin Sang expanded his search range, even diving beneath the sea surface to look for hidden underwater islands, but still came up empty-handed.  Even after such a long time, he saw no sign of Black Snake Mountain activity.</p><p>With no other choice, Qin Sang could only temporarily give up, planning to hunt down Black Snake Mountain disciples and gather information after the Demon Sea returned to normal, taking revenge at the same time.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Qin Sang withdrew from this sea area and returned to Lan Dou Island.</p><p>……</p><p>The market town.</p><p>The external avatar was diligently cultivating; its cultivation progress was incredibly rapid, already breaking through to the seventh level of the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>“Faster than when I cultivated using soul pills back then…”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, not idling himself, but busy with his own matters. Beams of brilliant light fell onto various parts of the cave, quickly filling almost the entire space, forcing the external avatar to cultivate in a corner. Qin Sang tapped his fingers, guiding these beams of light, quickly arranging them into a large array. Then, with a flip of his hand, three jade boxes appeared in his palm.</p><p>The high-grade spirit stones were finally gathered. He could finally refine the remaining Xuan iron pillars into banner poles.</p><p>Anticipation shone in Qin Sang's eyes. Once the banner poles were forged, the preparations for refining the Ten Directions Yama Banner would be complete. Once the Seven Killing Hall opened, he would possess an exceptional magic treasure.  Furthermore, his own skills in refining would make a leap forward during the process. The Xuan iron pillars contained extremely exquisite restrictions; even understanding a small part would allow Qin Sang to rival famous refining masters.</p><p>Three high-grade spirit stones were arranged in a row.  The spirit array was completed. Qin Sang added another layer of isolating restrictions outside before taking out the Xuan iron pillars, placing them in the center of the spirit array, and then launching a high-grade spirit stone.  In his second attempt at refining, Qin Sang was noticeably more proficient than before, utilizing the spirit stones more efficiently.</p><p>Soon, the Xuan iron pillars began to melt. Qin Sang's expression tightened, and he flicked a jade bottle from his fingertip; inside it were sealed the essences of demonic beasts.  Benefiting from his previous improvements in refining techniques, Qin Sang worked deftly, the refining process proceeding very smoothly.  One banner pole was gradually refined. Then a second, then a third…</p><p>More and more parts were separated, and the Xuan iron pillars themselves became smaller and smaller, until only a small lump remained, which was refined into the final banner pole.</p><p>‘Condense!’</p><p>Qin Sang let out a low shout.  A brilliant light washed over the banner poles, finally shaping them.  Beside him lay fourteen banner poles; with this last one, there were fifteen in total!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up; he reached out to examine them when he suddenly heard a crisp sound. He looked over to see that the high-grade spirit stone at the center of the spirit array had shattered. The spirit energy within had been completely depleted.</p><p>As he expected, this was the third high-grade spirit stone consumed, barely enough to support him in refining the Xuan iron pillars.</p><p>“Fifteen banner poles are complete…”</p><p>Qin Sang gathered the banner poles together, finding that their auras were still connected, as if they were one.  This was because during refining he had merely cleverly separated the Xuan iron pillars without damaging the restrictions within. He hadn’t wanted to do it this way, but there was no other way.</p><p>Even Kuiyin Laozu couldn't figure it out. After pondering for a hundred years, and because the Xuan Tie Zhu was already broken in two, he had a sudden inspiration and found this expedient method.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the other Yan Luo Banners are missing. If all the banner poles were gathered, perhaps the Xuan Tie Zhu could be restored. This treasure isn't something just anyone can refine.  Even Kuiyin Laozu couldn't unravel its restrictions. It's likely an ancient treasure left by a powerful cultivator of old. If the Xuan Tie Zhu could be repaired, its power would be unimaginable. Now, refining the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner, although a top-grade magic treasure, is a waste of its potential...”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself.</p><p>Kuiyin Sect legends say Kuiyin Laozu failed his tribulation, destroying five of the poles. But Qin Sang felt that the Xuan Tie Zhu was of extraordinary origin; a Nascent Soul tribulation shouldn't destroy the banner poles.  He just didn't know where they were lost.</p><p>Kuiyin Sect has been destroyed for over a hundred years now.</p><p>Before he left, a great war was imminent between Xiao Han Domain, Tian Xing Alliance, and Zui Yuan. He wondered what had become of it. Even if he returned to Xiao Han Domain, the chances of gathering the banner poles were slim.</p><p>“Forget it, I shouldn’t overthink! A top-grade magic treasure is something most cultivators can only dream of. Even if it's not an ancient treasure left by a powerful cultivator, even if it’s a legendary artifact surpassing magic treasures, it's incredibly rare. With my current abilities, I can't even activate it, I can only watch.”</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts. After checking the banner pole, he carefully stored it away, then calmly entered meditation, reflecting on his recent refinement.</p><p>The restrictions within the Xuan Tie Zhu were mysterious and vast, leaving Qin Sang with a profound sense of his own insignificance.</p><p>Such insights couldn't be gained overnight.</p><p>The next day at noon, Qin Sang awoke from his meditation, his eyes filled with a mixture of excitement and confusion, having only grasped a superficial understanding. He pondered for a moment before leaving his cave dwelling.</p><p>He rented a shop in the market, hung up an alchemy sign, and decided to stay there permanently.</p><p>He would refine his body with star essence, refine magical tools, and study the Xuan Tie Zhu restrictions while also befriending local cultivators to gather information about Lan Dou Gate. His external avatar could also quietly cultivate, allowing him to focus on multiple tasks at once.</p><p>The shop opened.</p><p>Qin Sang hired someone to look after the shop, frequently traveling between the shop and his cave dwelling.</p><p>Thanks to his superb alchemy skills, even without the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the magical tools he crafted were more powerful than others', and his reputation quickly spread.</p>
