<h1>Chapter 1187: A Great Victory</h1><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Jing Lin’s primordial spirit felt a sharp pain.  His face turned pale, his hands clutching his head as he let out a pained scream. His body trembled.  The brilliance of the Hu Feng Bracelet dimmed.</p><p>The same scene unfolded before Qin Sang.</p><p>With the jade Buddha, Qin Sang wasn’t even afraid of the Soul-Splitting Slash, let alone the trifling Soul Annihilation Cone. But the recent discovery made him think twice.  Qin Sang didn’t want to reveal his immunity to primordial spirit attacks.</p><p>But if he pretended to be injured, he couldn't control the twelve demonic banners anymore, and the hard-won opportunity would be wasted, letting Pei escape.</p><p>Qin Sang was always decisive. Realizing the Soul Annihilation Cone was not simple, he immediately changed tactics, altering his incantation. The sound of thunder echoed from within him.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The circular shield shattered.</p><p>The Soul Annihilation Cone pierced Qin Sang's forehead, but as expected, it was blocked by the jade Buddha. However, Qin Sang's performance was even more dramatic than Jing Lin's. He screamed repeatedly, blood flowing from his seven orifices, staggering and nearly falling to the ground.</p><p>Years of practice had ingrained this act into his instincts; it was incredibly skillful, revealing no flaws.</p><p>The twelve demonic banner formation crumbled without attack. The banners tilted, the demonic fire scattered, leaving gaps.</p><p>Pei saw a chance to escape.</p><p>But before a smile could touch his face, a sudden thunderbolt plunged Pei into despair.</p><p>Blinding lightning.</p><p>Divine thunder descended from the heavens.</p><p>The demonic fire dissipated, the Youjing Tower violently shook.  Pei, already severely weakened from sacrificing his own essence to activate the tower in a desperate bid for survival, was like a lamb to the slaughter against the power of the  Summoning Thunder Technique.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Before the eyes of everyone, Pei was struck by the heavenly thunder, his body charred black, his corpse falling to the ground.</p><p>All this happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Chan Ling and Tan, intending to save Pei, saw him struck down before they could even break through the Han Ling formation. Even his Nascent Soul couldn't escape, utterly perishing!</p><p>The two were furious.</p><p>Their opponents were clearly three Nascent Soul stage cultivators, slightly weaker than them. Three against three, they had slain Pei before their very eyes.</p><p>Pei, sacrificing himself, had still failed to survive.</p><p>Chan Ling raged, unsure how to explain this failure.  Tan rushed towards the Youjing Tower to prevent Qin Sang from destroying the formation, while Chan Ling pursued.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Jing Lin, slightly recovered, saw Qin Sang using thunder magic to kill Pei. While overjoyed, he felt deep concern. Both their primordial spirits were injured; if intercepted by Chan Ling and Tan, their fate remained uncertain.</p><p>Ignoring his injuries, Jing Lin quickly retrieved the Hu Feng Bracelet and, transforming into a gust of green wind, fled back to the Han Ling formation through another route. Skilled in wind manipulation, having grasped the basics of wind escape, his speed was naturally swift.</p><p>Qin Sang was unharmed.</p><p>After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, the consumption of the Summoning Thunder Technique was far less than during his Golden Core stage. Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Chan Ling, but didn’t want to reveal his uninjured state.</p><p>Of course, he hadn't forgotten his spoils of war. He had used his two strongest trump cards to kill Pei.</p><p>Qin Sang collected the demonic banners and Pei's corpse.  Without time to destroy the Youjing Tower formation, he turned into a streak of lightning and fled.</p><p>Chan Ling and Tan tried to intercept them, but were fiercely entangled by Si Di.  They watched helplessly as Qin Sang and Jing Lin escaped into the Han Ling formation, erupting in another fit of rage.</p><p>“These are Jade Dew Pills. They treat primordial spirit injuries. Please take them, fellow Daoists!”</p><p>Si Di flicked two pills towards them.</p><p>The pills were crystal-clear, like two drops of jade dew.</p><p>“I've heard that Jade Dew Pills are miraculous healing medicines, far surpassing those made by the Two Regions Alliance.  The ingredients needed are incredibly rare.  I finally see them for myself!”</p><p>Jing Lin, unable to conceal his excitement, took a pill.  His gaze shifted to Qin Sang, devoid of the previous disdain. “This was all thanks to fellow Daoist Mingyue! I thought we’d fail utterly.”</p><p>Jing Lin was still shaken.</p><p>The moment he was struck by the Soul Annihilation Cone, he knew killing Pei was impossible. The outcome exceeded his expectations greatly.</p><p>“Indeed! With fellow Daoist Mingyue's power, if not for the Soul Annihilation Cone, you could have faced Chan Ling alone.  Pei had run rampant for years, but to fall to a newly ascended Nascent Soul cultivator… who could have imagined?”</p><p>Si Di was astonished.</p><p>He was far enough away to see clearly.</p><p>The assassination of Old Master Pei was a dramatic affair. Qin Sang first unleashed twelve fire banners, and then, at a critical moment, summoned a heavenly thunderbolt. Each technique was a top-tier divine ability.</p><p>He secretly warned himself never to become an enemy of this person.</p><p>Unfortunately, this kind of figure wasn't from the human race.</p><p>"I wouldn't dare take all the credit. Without your cooperation, even with my skills, I couldn't have achieved this. Now's not the time to talk.  Chanling is not to be underestimated. Be careful, both of you. I'll return to command the Cold Bell Formation."</p><p>Qin Sang clutched the Jade Dew Pill, saying in a low voice.</p><p>"Right! Right!"</p><p>Jing Lin nodded repeatedly, already completely obeying Qin Sang, grinning cruelly. "With a Yuan Ying dead, their morale is shattered. I want to see how long they can hold out.  We two brothers will go and meet Chanling!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and flew back into the formation.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang leave, Jing Lin and Si Di exchanged a glance, a hint of awe in their eyes.</p><p>What followed was straightforward.</p><p>After Old Master Pei's death, the Crime Abyss army was demoralized and lost the will to fight.</p><p>In contrast, the Two Realms Alliance's morale soared.</p><p>Qin Sang took control of the array, commanding the Cold Bell Formation, orchestrating its various changes, and providing reinforcements.</p><p>For a time, the Two Realms Alliance was unstoppable, routing the Crime Abyss forces. Even with Old Master Tan reclaiming the Nether Crystal Pagoda and Chanling holding the line, they couldn't turn the tide.</p><p>More importantly, Chanling no longer had the desire to continue fighting.</p><p>Pei Lao Mo's death sent shivers down Chanling's spine.</p><p>At the same time, he secretly rejoiced that it was Pei Lao Mo, not himself, who had tested the waters.</p><p>He felt deep apprehension towards that unknown demon king and decided to keep a close eye on him.</p><p>Chanling suspected his own exposure was the demon king's doing and had to go back and analyze what went wrong in this battle.</p><p>If this demon king truly was his nemesis, he'd have another enemy to avoid.</p><p>Leaving behind a field of corpses, Chanling hastily retreated from Triple Fold Pass.</p><p>The battle ended abruptly.</p><p>The enemy still possessed the Nether Crystal Pagoda, and two Yuan Ying powerhouses, Jing Lin and Si Di, were satisfied with their gains. They didn't pursue for long before sounding the retreat.</p><p>Although there were inevitable casualties, this was undoubtedly a great victory. The Two Realms Alliance hadn't slain a Yuan Ying Grandmaster of the Crime Abyss in a long time.</p><p>The lower-level cultivators cheered triumphantly, anticipating a share of the spoils and considerable military merit.</p><p>Si Di and Jing Lin arranged for personnel to clear the battlefield and made various arrangements to prevent a Crime Abyss counterattack, before eagerly flying towards the tall building.</p><p>Qin Sang did not participate in the pursuit.</p><p>He sat there, head slightly bowed, lost in thought.</p><p>Sensing the presence of Jing Lin and Si Di, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he turned towards the outside.</p>
