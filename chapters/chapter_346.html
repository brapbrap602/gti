<h1>Chapter 339: Contemplation</h1><p>Under Tan Hao's expectant gaze, Qin Sang meticulously examined Tan Jie.</p><p>Unfortunately, his knowledge of alchemy was limited, and he couldn't think of a way to heal Tan Jie.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something. His eyes lit up, and he rummaged through his Mustard Seed Bag, finally retrieving a crystal coffin.</p><p>This crystal coffin was left behind by Senior Sister Qing Ting and Senior Brother Jiang after their deaths.</p><p>Qin Sang later discovered that the crystal coffin was a unique artifact. Senior Brother Jiang relied on it to maintain his physical vitality without elixirs, and the rate at which his Nascent Soul dissipated was greatly reduced.</p><p>He didn't know where Senior Sister Qing Ting obtained the crystal coffin, but it must have been precious.</p><p>The crystal coffin wasn't useful to Qin Sang, but he kept it because of its peculiar abilities.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it would come in handy now.</p><p>By placing Tan Jie inside the crystal coffin, they wouldn't have to worry about his physical body, and the rate of his Nascent Soul's dissipation would slow down, significantly easing Tan Hao's burden.</p><p>Hearing about the crystal coffin's abilities, Tan Hao was overjoyed, but also somewhat skeptical.</p><p>Confident, Qin Sang instructed Tan Hao to lift Tan Jie's body from the spiritual liquid and place him inside the crystal coffin.</p><p>Tan Hao's eyes widened with anticipation as he watched Tan Jie. After a while, he saw a strange energy surge from the crystal coffin, transforming into a layer of mist that enveloped Tan Jie, nourishing his body.</p><p>While it couldn't completely stop his Nascent Soul from dissipating, the rate did slow considerably, allowing the Tranquil Spirit Pill's effects to last longer.</p><p>Although this extra time wasn't much, it was invaluable to Tan Hao!</p><p>"I know a friend who has experience in treating soul injuries. Wait for me in the cave. I'll return to Gloom Mountain Pass and send him a message to see if he can think of a solution."</p><p>The person Qin Sang was referring to was Wanderer Yun.</p><p>As the saying goes, "long illness makes a good doctor." Among Qin Sang's acquaintances, Wanderer Yun was the only one who might have a solution for Tan Jie. Wanderer Yun was refining medicinal power and currently cultivating in his cave, so he wouldn't be disturbed.</p><p>However, Tan Jie's soul wasn't simply injured; it was nearly dissipated. Even Wanderer Yun might be unable to reverse the situation. But moved by Tan Hao's words, Qin Sang had to try.</p><p>Tan Jie's injuries were severe, and every delay could bring new complications.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang documented Tan Jie's condition in a letter, immediately bid farewell to Tan Hao, activated the Stygian Cloud, and returned to the Elixir Pavilion at Gloom Mountain Pass.</p><p>When he requested the Elixir Pavilion to send the letter back to Skull Ridge Pass through the Grand Elixir Sect's channels, he unexpectedly learned that Wanderer Yun had already left seclusion and was on his way to Gloom Mountain Pass, arriving soon.</p><p>What was Wanderer Yun doing coming to Gloom Mountain Pass now?</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised by this. After some thought, he returned to Tan Hao's cave and informed him of the situation, omitting Wanderer Yun's identity.</p><p>"...It would be best if my friend could examine him personally. But be mindful of your words. Don't mention past events, as if they never happened."</p><p>He had collaborated with Wanderer Yun several times and considered him a close friend despite the age difference. He believed Wanderer Yun wouldn't harm him without reason, but it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>Tan Hao didn't ask any questions and nodded without hesitation. "Don't worry, I understand."</p><p>His voice held uncontainable excitement and anticipation, mixed with a hint of worry.</p><p>Immediately, they brought the unconscious Tan Jie to Gloom Mountain Pass. Qin Sang spent spirit stones to rent two quiet caves while they waited for Wanderer Yun.</p><p>After settling the Tan brothers, Qin Sang returned to his own cave.</p><p>The cave was located in the swamp outside Gloom Mountain Pass, formed within a hollowed-out ancient tree. It was the first time Qin Sang had stayed in such a cave, and he found it quite novel.</p><p>The spirit vein seemed to be deep within the swamp, as the cave had a rich concentration of spiritual energy, justifying its price.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't rush to meditate. He sat cross-legged on the wooden bed, reflecting on his experiences and the shifts in his mindset since encountering Tan Hao.</p><p>He had helped Tan Hao and Shi Hong without hesitation.</p><p>Partly, it was due to the timely warning he received from Tan Hao when purchasing the *Ghostly Scripture* at the Gloom Mountain Market. Qin Sang had always remembered this favor.</p><p>Another reason stemmed from his experiences in the Wraith Yin Sect. Of those who joined the sect together, only four remained, and Tan Jie was now a living corpse.</p><p>Shi Hong and Tan Hao's experiences were also incredibly difficult, evoking a sense of shared sorrow in Qin Sang.</p><p>Having believed they perished in the chaos, learning they were alive made him eager to help, especially since it required little effort.</p><p>The shift in his mindset came later.</p><p>Witnessing the bond between the Tan brothers, recalling the love between Senior Sister Qing Ting and Senior Brother Jiang, and even thinking about Yu Daiyue's obsessive pursuit of immortality, Qin Sang seemed to have gained some insight.</p><p>About himself, about relationships, about the Dao…</p><p>"Family, love…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his gaze distant, as if seeing through time and space.</p><p>Love was something Qin Sang had left behind in this life.</p><p>But family still held a place in his heart, albeit one he deliberately ignored.</p><p>If he hadn't come to a new world, completely severing the possibility of reunion…</p><p>If his parents had suddenly appeared before him before he embarked on the path of immortality…</p><p>Would he still have the resolve to sever his earthly ties?</p><p>His understanding of the Dao seemed to have deepened, but he wasn't sure what impact this change would have or how much it would benefit his future cultivation.</p><p>"Hu…"</p><p>Qin Sang came back to his senses, exhaling a turbid breath.</p><p>He retrieved a jade box containing Soul-Guiding Grass from his Mustard Seed Bag, along with the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>Wanderer Yun wouldn't arrive for a few days, giving him time to research how to refine Heavenly Corpse Talismans.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang reread the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* from beginning to end, especially the chapters on refining living corpses, carefully pondering each word and sentence.</p><p>Refining Heavenly Corpse Talismans was difficult, demanding a high level of skill from the refiner, particularly in controlling spiritual power and divine sense. Qin Sang couldn't guarantee success every time.</p><p>The first step was to refine the Soul-Guiding Grass into "talisman paper" using a secret technique from the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>This step didn't seem too difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the entire process, mentally rehearsing it several times before attempting it.</p><p>He removed the restrictions on the wooden box, carefully took out the Soul-Guiding Grass, and extended his divine sense into it, observing and analyzing every vein. These veins were like the meridians of the Soul-Guiding Grass, crucial to the success rate of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>When separating the leaves, he absolutely couldn't damage them.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang had a complete understanding of the Soul-Guiding Grass. After a moment of contemplation, his divine sense transformed into an invisible blade, gently slicing the stem of the Soul-Guiding Grass.</p><p>This cut was made without a trace of visible energy.</p><p>The Soul-Guiding Grass suddenly separated on its own, a single leaf drifting down.</p><p>Success!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy as he caught the leaf.</p>
