<h1>Chapter 1619: The Cloud Dragon Incident</h1><p>“The Yin Devil Nail… Could it be the Grand Elder of Tian Hao Tower?”</p><p>Qin Sang, having cleverly used Fan Laomo, successfully passed through the Cloud Qi Square.  At the last moment, he glimpsed Fan Laomo's figure but couldn't see clearly.</p><p>However, the Yin Devil Nail is a well-known demonic artifact in Central State, easily recognizable.</p><p>Ku Rong Laomo of Tian Hao Tower should be attending a Dharma Assembly in Jinyu State. He wouldn't have received the news in time to come.</p><p>Ku Rong Laomo had mentioned that the Sect Master was in crucial cultivation, in seclusion, and that Tian Hao Tower's Grand Elder, Fan Laomo, had other matters to attend to.  It seems those matters brought him to Southern State.</p><p>Whether this was a coincidence or something else, Qin Sang now suspects Tian Hao Tower was involved in addition to the Eight Sceneries. There might even be a Tian Hao Tower spy among the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>He inadvertently offended the Grand Elder, but Qin Sang has no regrets.  Given the chance, he would make the same choice.</p><p>Cooperating with demonic cultivators is akin to courting disaster.</p><p>If Qin Sang were vying with the Eight Sceneries and Wuxiang Immortal Sect for something, he might consider it.</p><p>His goals are clear: first, the cultivation technique, and second, the Nascent Soul legacy.  At present, it doesn't seem there's a conflict of interest with the two factions.</p><p>When the Wuxiang Immortal Sect treasure truly appears, and a struggle is necessary, he can decide then based on the situation.</p><p>“Watch out!”</p><p>Qin Sang heard someone shout from behind.</p><p>The cultivators of the two sects attacking the stone pillar restriction immediately stopped, surrounding the restriction like they faced a formidable enemy, preventing the Blue Cloud Grass from being stolen.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang showed no sign of slowing down. Without even glancing at the Blue Cloud Grass, he passed directly through a gap in the square, leaving without hesitation and disappearing into the clouds in an instant.</p><p>“What incredible escape technique!  Late Nascent Soul stage! Who is this?”</p><p>A Taiyue Sect elder exclaimed, shocked.</p><p>He searched his memory, but couldn't recall such a powerful cultivator existing near Southern State.</p><p>The appearance of the celestial phenomenon shocked the world.</p><p>Southern State would inevitably be filled with experts.</p><p>But this person arrived far too quickly, even preceding them into the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Liting went ahead. The others were led by Hua Chenzi and Zi Lei Zhenren’s junior brother.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren’s junior brother led people to investigate, while Hua Chenzi guarded the Blue Cloud Grass.</p><p>Hua Chenzi's gaze was drawn to the lightning, his expression thoughtful. Even with his knowledge, he couldn’t identify the person. Could there be hidden experts in Southern State he didn't know about?</p><p>He suddenly felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>This person just happened to be traveling nearby; it's too much of a coincidence!</p><p>They had thought themselves the hidden predators behind the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, with ample time to explore slowly and cautiously.</p><p>Now a variable has appeared; hopefully, the situation doesn't spiral out of control.</p><p>Urgency filled Hua Chenzi’s heart. Seeing that Qin Sang hadn't coveted the Blue Cloud Grass, he was about to signal others not to pursue when he received a message from Zi Lei Zhenren’s junior brother: “There’s another person here!”</p><p>It was Fan Laomo who had revealed himself.</p><p>Hua Chenzi furrowed his brows slightly. He thought the other party was just making a diversion to enter the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, but it turned out there was someone else outside.</p><p>“What’s the relationship between these two?”</p><p>Hua Chenzi wondered. As this thought arose, a sudden warning surged through his heart. He shouted a warning, his sleeves shaking as a Xuanhuang light shot out.</p><p>Within the light was a lamp, seemingly carved from rough stone. It had no oil or wick.</p><p>Without any visible action from Hua Chenzi, a flame suddenly ignited within the lamp. The flame was small, but the yellow light was incredibly bright, illuminating the area around the stone pillar.</p><p>In the illuminated area, an inexplicable force flowed through the void.</p><p>Hua Chenzi still wasn't reassured. He immediately released two spirit beasts, two rare creatures—the Tunnel Mountain Earthworms.</p><p>The Tunnel Mountain Earthworms grew wildly in size, their bodies lengthening to resemble dragons.  The two beasts, one on each side, swung their tails, emitting strange humming sounds, as they flew towards the lamp.</p><p>At this point, the others finally reacted.</p><p>They hadn't sensed anything unusual, but trusted Hua Chenzi's judgment, and they hurriedly summoned their treasures and abilities. However, they had no idea where the target was or which direction to attack.</p><p>Suddenly, the light flickered.  Looking closely, they saw countless demonic shadows appearing within the area illuminated by the lamp.</p><p>Thousands of demonic shadows rushed into the lamp's range, instantly bearing immense pressure, fluctuating, yet their demonic flames burned even more fiercely, ignoring everyone as they furiously lunged towards the Blue Cloud Grass.</p><p>“The Ten Thousand Demons Yin Classic! Fan Laomo!”</p><p>Hua Chenzi’s eyes flashed; another uninvited guest!</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Countless demonic shadows laughed wildly. Fan Laomo’s arrogant voice echoed everywhere, “Old Ghost Hua, thanks for helping me find the Blue Cloud Herb. Quickly hand over the elixir!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s attack had indeed caused Fan Laomo trouble, but it also presented him with an opportunity. Qin Sang had stormed into the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, ignoring the Blue Cloud Herb, precisely when Hua Chenzi and the others were most relaxed.</p><p>Fan Laomo was incredibly bold and seized this fleeting moment. No one else would have dared to take such a risk.</p><p>…</p><p>“So Fan Laomo was after the Blue Cloud Herb…”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the disturbance behind him, paused slightly, and a look of realization dawned on his face.</p><p>Ahead, the sea of clouds stretched endlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to glance back, having no intention of interfering in the fight. His gaze swept over the two majestic cloud dragon carvings.</p><p>The cloud dragons seemed like guardians of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, standing sentinel.</p><p>The protective barriers weren't activated.  He wasn't sure of the cloud dragons' abilities, but when Qin Sang had approached them, he felt a strange tightening in his chest, and didn't dare underestimate them.</p><p>However, this glance revealed an unusual detail.</p><p>Beyond the Cloud Qi Plaza, the chaos wasn't subsiding; instead, it was escalating.  Turbulent currents surged forth continuously, constantly battering the cloud dragons.</p><p>At the limit of his Celestial Eye ability, Qin Sang saw that many scales on the inner side of the cloud dragons' claws were broken, with cracks appearing.</p><p>While the cloud dragons appeared solid, they were actually compromised and wouldn't remain stable for long.</p><p>“What will happen if the cloud dragons collapse?”</p><p>This thought suddenly struck Qin Sang. He glanced at the Cloud Qi Plaza; once the idea took root, he couldn't shake it.</p><p>He was already inside; it shouldn't affect him much!</p><p>Making his decision, Qin Sang altered his course, flying level alongside the dragon claw. He found that while the claw wasn't grasping anything tangible, an invisible force was clearly supporting the cloud dragon.</p><p>After careful observation, Qin Sang immediately summoned the Solar God Tree.</p><p>His second Nascent Soul returned to his main body.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his avatar, then put some distance between himself and the dragons.  With a slight movement of his mind, flames danced on the Solar God Tree, and three Solar God Birds spread their wings and flew towards the cracks in the dragon's claw.</p><p>Before the birds reached their target, Qin Sang used all his energy to flee.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Just as Qin Sang escaped into the depths of the cloud, a deafening explosion roared behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart pounded. Without looking back, he only used the Celestial Eye Butterfly to observe the rear. He saw a burst of crimson light, quickly swallowed by blinding white light.</p><p>Hitting the weakest point, the cloud dragon's claw finally shattered completely.</p><p>The enormous dragon body swayed, tilting to one side.</p><p>The relentless turbulent currents added to the instability. With a resounding crash, the cloud dragon collapsed, like a celestial dragon plunging into the sea.</p><p>Amidst the colossal waves, the cloud dragon's body shattered into several pieces. The white light erupted from the fractured body.</p><p>The white light was an unnatural phenomenon caused by the imbalance of power within the cloud dragon. Once the imbalance occurred, the cloud dragon crumbled like dust.</p><p>Countless beams of white light converged, obliterating all other colors in this space. Even more terrifying were the fluctuations accompanying the white light.</p><p>Anyone looking down from above would have seen a white ripple erupting from where the cloud dragon perished, expanding outwards at an astonishing speed. The spreading wave was clearly visible in the sea of clouds.</p><p>A terrifying wave of clouds surged upwards.</p><p>On the Cloud Qi Plaza, Fan Laomo and Hua Chenzi were struggling for the Blue Cloud Herb.  Sensing the cataclysmic change, they were all shocked.  Before they could react, they were swallowed by the wave.</p><p>The other cloud dragon was also affected and subsequently collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang had already escaped the danger. Sensing the escalating chaos and astonishing fluctuations behind him, he was astonished.</p><p>He had anticipated that the cloud dragon's collapse might cause Fan Laomo some trouble, but he never expected such a massive disruption.</p><p>At that moment…</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly clearly saw that the two cloud dragons had been replaced by an endless cloud wall.</p><p>The Cloud Qi Plaza must have been destroyed.</p><p>The cloud wall was seamless, stretching across the void, filled with chaotic energy, and still expanding.</p><p>Just then, a group of people arrived – other successors of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Without the protection of the altar, the others, with lower cultivation than the disciples of Zhu Wudao, lagged behind.</p><p>With their own individual agendas and lacking the unity of the Eight Views Sect and Mount Tai Sect, they were even slower than Hua Chenzi.</p><p>Due to turbulent currents and restrictions within the passage, both groups were diverted in different directions, narrowly avoiding a major confrontation.</p><p>Everyone stared at the cloud wall ahead, their faces grim.  They couldn't fathom what had transpired, but it was clear the cloud wall hadn't existed when Zhu Wu Dao and his group entered. They were too late, now blocked.</p><p>Anyone wishing to enter the Wuxiang Immortal Sect would first have to find a way through this cloud wall; the sheer power emanating from it suggested it wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. He hadn't anticipated creating such an insurmountable barrier, cutting off the path for those who followed.  If Fan Laomo and the others were still alive, they'd be cursing him soundly.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was undoubtedly a stroke of luck. He wasn't sure if the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect or Zi Lei Zhenren had noticed any flaws in the cloud dragons, perhaps they had, but with companions still behind, they hadn't acted.  Qin Sang, a lone wolf, had no such qualms.  The fewer allies others had, the less to share the spoils, benefiting him greatly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around again, seeing no sign of Fan Laomo and the others; they were likely struggling in the turbulent clouds.  He didn't hesitate, and left.</p><p>Deep within the cloud sea...</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao and his group remained at the forefront.  The combined might of these top-tier experts rendered the passage's obstacles insignificant; none were injured. Zhu Wu Dao led the way.</p><p>After a period of swift travel, they finally spotted something tangible in the cloud sea: a flight of stone steps.</p><p>The steps were constructed from white stone slabs.  Not a single slab was intact; even the best-preserved were heavily cracked, their crevices filled with moss, emitting a strong smell of decay.</p><p>Despite the dilapidated state, Zhu Wu Dao's face lit up. "We've arrived!"</p><p>They increased their speed, only to hear a tremor behind them, causing them to halt and look back. Although they couldn't see the sky, they could sense unusual fluctuations; a significant change had undoubtedly occurred.</p><p>"Are those the two cloud dragons?"</p><p>The oddly-faced man pondered, glancing at Zhu Wu Dao. Though a successor of the Mu lineage, his knowledge of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was limited compared to Zhu Wu Dao's.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao nodded slightly. Seeing the questioning looks, he explained, "I don't know what those cloud dragons are, otherwise, I could easily manipulate them and do as I pleased within the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. They were probably similar to the mountain-guarding automatons, but were certainly damaged during the great upheaval. Now, with the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's reactivation and the impact of the turbulent currents, they're completely destroyed.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; their collapse prevents others from sharing the spoils; we can explore at our leisure."</p><p>"It only hinders some insignificant people," Su Zi Nan scoffed, urging Zhu Wu Dao to lead on.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao flashed across the stone steps.  Trailing lights flickered as everyone descended, looking around to discover they were on a mountain slope; the steps snaked upwards, seemingly leading to the summit.</p><p>"Is this the Wuxiang Immortal Sect?"</p><p>The swordsman looked disappointed.  All he saw was a desolate forest, ruin everywhere. The summit was hidden in the clouds, indistinct.</p><p>"Don't worry, to enter the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, we must continue," Zhu Wu Dao raised his head slightly, his gaze following the stone steps. "Has anyone noticed that the space here has become much more stable?"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's words made them realize the difference between this place and the outside.</p><p>"It can't be that simple, can it?" the man in white robes hesitated.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao nodded. "You're perceptive."</p><p>Before he finished, Zhu Wu Dao dashed up the steps.  Everyone quickly followed.</p><p>After a short burst of speed, Zhu Wu Dao suddenly leaped, rising into the air.</p><p>Initially, all was well.</p><p>But when Zhu Wu Dao reached a height of about three feet, the clouds stirred, accompanied by a sharp whistling sound. A magical sword materialized out of nowhere, aiming straight for Zhu Wu Dao's forehead.</p><p>Simultaneously, Su Zi Nan and the others noticed something unusual about Zhu Wu Dao; his protective aura fluctuated violently, seemingly under immense pressure.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao was prepared; with a wave of his hand, a golden mirror appeared before him.</p><p>With a 'dong', the center of the golden mirror bulged but wasn't pierced by the sword.  The turbulence in the cloud sea intensified, clearly indicating more than one sword.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao landed back on the ground. "As you've seen, once inside the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, it's best not to fly too high."</p><p>Everyone nodded, grateful for the warning.</p><p>The Wuxiang Immortal Sect's formation was leaderless. They had ways to temporarily circumvent the flight restrictions and could handle the magical swords, but the combination was more difficult, and might trigger other unforeseen consequences. It was best to stay grounded.</p><p>Following Zhu Wu Dao, they continued up the steps, reaching the summit.</p>
