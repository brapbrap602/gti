<h1>Chapter 813: Island Master Luo</h1><p>Chapter 813: Island Master Luo</p><p>Qin Sang lay hidden outside the mountain gate.</p><p>Less than an hour passed before he saw fluctuations in the瀚海 Sect's protective formation, instantly brightening his spirits.</p><p>Several figures flew out from the mountain gate, disappearing into the distance.</p><p>The leader's aura was clearly far superior to the others.</p><p>"Finally, the snake has left its hole."</p><p>Qin Sang remained where he was, waiting to ensure no one else emerged from the 瀚海 Sect before setting off.</p><p>The 瀚海 Sect Master, along with his disciples, flew towards the market town.</p><p>With evidence in hand, this time he intended to thoroughly punish them.  Unfortunately, Island Master Luo had previously forbidden him from eliminating them completely.</p><p>The Sect Master couldn't possibly offend this person or the power behind him.</p><p>Every time he recalled the destruction of Spirit Turtle Island two years ago, the 瀚海 Sect Master trembled uncontrollably with fear.  The power behind Island Master Luo was terrifyingly mysterious, capable of capturing and killing even Yuan Ying stage cultivators.</p><p>The 瀚海 Sect Master felt no resistance, only excitement, at being connected to such a powerful force. He dreamt of rising to greatness.</p><p>However, after the death of the Spirit Turtle Island Master, Island Master Luo had never contacted him again.</p><p>Lost in thought, the 瀚海 Sect Master suddenly felt a sense of unease.  He sensed something was wrong, abruptly halting his flight and turning sharply. He roared, "Who's there?!"</p><p>Before his words finished, a thunderous beast roar erupted from the forest below.</p><p>A deafening crash followed, as a green whirlwind materialized out of thin air, obliterating a large swathe of forest. With tremendous force, it surged skyward, engulfing them.</p><p>"Dodge!"</p><p>Recognizing the power of the whirlwind, the 瀚海 Sect Master's face paled. He forcefully shoved several disciples aside, then a blue light shot from his dantian.</p><p>The blue light manifested as an oddly shaped sword, seemingly forged from some beast bone—his lifeblood, painstakingly refined as his magic weapon.</p><p>The Sect Master channeled his energy, the bone sword blazed with blue light, and its sword energy surged, blocking the whirlwind.</p><p>But then he heard several screams.  Turning his head, he was horrified to find several disciples dead, slain by a crystal-clear flying sword.</p><p>"Another one!"</p><p>At this point, the 瀚海 Sect Master realized he had fallen into a trap.</p><p>His first instinct was to flee.</p><p>But as he attempted to escape, the flying sword pursued him relentlessly, like a thunderbolt, exploding with incredible speed. Before him, it shimmered and split into four, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>"Sword Light Diversification!"</p><p>The 瀚海 Sect Master cried out in terror.</p><p>Qin Sang and the two-headed beast attacked.</p><p>In the Dao of the Sword, breakthroughs are the hardest, but once achieved, progress is rapid. Qin Sang had mastered Sword Light Diversification, refining his sword light to the point of near invisibility, already capable of splitting it into three.</p><p>Given more time, he could achieve complete mastery of Sword Light Diversification and attempt to comprehend the realm of "One Sword, One Formation," a realm typically mastered only by Yuan Ying masters—an extremely challenging feat.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding only a simple ebony sword, was more than a match for the 瀚海 Sect Master, especially with the two-headed beast assisting.</p><p>The man and beast attacked in turn.</p><p>The 瀚海 Sect Master, overwhelmed, quickly showed signs of defeat.</p><p>To end the battle swiftly, Qin Sang unleashed the Ten Directions Yama Banner.  Seizing the moment, he swept the Sect Master’s magic weapon away with demonic fire, easily cornering him.</p><p>He didn't even need to use the Star Conch or the Blood-Soaked Divine Light.</p><p>"My life is forfeit!"</p><p>The 瀚海 Sect Master, utterly helpless, was filled with despair. He didn't even have time to ask his attacker's identity or reason for killing him.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Nine Netherworld demonic fire shattered the 瀚ha Sect Master’s protective aura, but Qin Sang didn’t kill him.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly appeared beside the 瀚海 Sect Master, sealing his cultivation, his eyes sweeping the surroundings. He recalled the two-headed beast, and they immediately fled to a distant land.</p><p>From his appearance to the capture of the 瀚海 Sect Master, Qin Sang's actions were clean and efficient, leaving no trace.  He only released the Sect Master on a deserted island after reaching safety far from the Ba Gate Island and confirming there were no pursuers.</p><p>After interrogation,</p><p>Qin Sang finally learned the truth.</p><p>The key figure was a person called Island Master Luo.</p><p>On the eve of the Spirit Turtle Island incident, Island Master Luo had appeared.  Upon learning of Luo's cultivation and identity, the 瀚海 Sect Master immediately surrendered without resistance.</p><p>Several other powerful figures were also subjugated by Island Master Luo.</p><p>Qin Sang then learned that Island Master Luo had ordered them to investigate the Spirit Turtle Island Master, to find out the identity of a cultivator who had once listened to his teachings.  They were strictly forbidden to reveal this information, under penalty of death.</p><p>The Spirit Turtle Island Master had a mysterious background and was not easy to deal with, but after careful consideration, everyone decided to obey Island Master Luo's orders.</p><p>Lord Luo, the island lord of a large island near Quheng Island, was secretly working for a powerful island lord from Quheng Island itself.</p><p>It's common knowledge that the Quheng Island lord represents both righteous and demonic cultivators.  Even the most powerful evil cultivators in the Liefeng Islands wouldn't dare attack Quheng Island.  </p><p>Both factions are immensely powerful, true overlords of the Canglang Sea!  </p><p>Even with the formidable strength of Lord Linggui, he was only one man – how could he possibly contend with them?</p><p>As it turned out, they chose wisely.</p><p>Lord Luo secretly infiltrated Bamen Island, subjugated forces like the Hanhai Sect, and investigated Lord Linggui, but remained inactive for a long time.  The Hanhai Sect Master knew more because Lord Luo was hidden within the sect.</p><p>All the Golden Core stage experts connected to Lord Linggui were hunted down.</p><p>Only after Linggui Island's destruction did they realize that Lord Luo, a powerful late-stage Golden Core cultivator, was merely a pawn, gathering information. The true perpetrators were Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>After the assassination of Lord Linggui, Lord Luo rewarded them. It seemed their sole purpose was to eliminate Lord Linggui, and they left after achieving their goal.</p><p>The Hanhai Sect Master, thanks to Lord Luo's reward, finally broke through a bottleneck that had plagued him for years.</p><p>Having believed his hopes of reaching the mid-Golden Core stage were lost, this breakthrough rekindled his ambition.  He desperately tried to curry favor with Lord Luo, but was utterly ignored.</p><p>He still harbored a glimmer of hope, instructing his disciples to keep an eye out for any survivors, giving him a pretext to visit Lord Luo.</p><p>"The attack was carried out by forces from both the righteous and demonic paths!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, not surprised. Only these two powerful factions possessed such strength.</p><p>"But it's uncertain whether it was the righteous or the demonic side."</p><p>"Did Senior Qingzhu offend everyone, or just a single sect?"</p><p>"We need to identify Lord Luo first. He's an island lord near Quheng Island, but we don't know which one. However, with his cultivation level, he couldn't be unknown. We should be able to find out more on Quheng Island."</p><p>Seeing that Qingzhu's enemies hadn't left any hidden dangers and the Hanhai Sect was vulnerable, Qin Sang felt no further worry. Before leaving, he returned to Bamen Island, plundered the Hanhai Sect's treasury, making a small fortune.  He disguised himself as a passing bandit, acting as if he had simply seized the opportunity, thus avoiding any connection to Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>With the Hanhai Sect's downfall, Bamen Island would once again descend into chaos, but Qin Sang was no longer concerned with such matters.</p>
