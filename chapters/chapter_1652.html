<h1>Chapter 1643: Fire Rhinoceros Island</h1><p>The Cloudroaming Sword hung upside down above.</p><p>Its tip pointed directly at the Gu King.</p><p>Sword light pulsed, sword intent brewed, contained but not released.</p><p>Before the sword even moved, the Gu King began to show signs of anxiety and restlessness. Its protective venomous aura immediately retracted, a clear indication that it had encountered a natural enemy.</p><p>The Gu King raised its head, stared at the Cloudroaming Sword, and let out a threatening screech.  When it reached Qin Sang's ears, however, it sounded strangely lacking in confidence.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang knew he had found the key. He immediately catalyzed his sword intent. The Cloudroaming Sword trembled slightly, and sword light poured forth like a torrent.</p><p>Within the sword light, there was no killing intent, only pure sword intent.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intend to kill the Gu King, but to suppress its ferocious nature.</p><p>This single sword strike was remarkably effective.</p><p>The Gu King dodged frantically. Having followed the Strange-Faced Man for so many years, the fear of this aura was deeply ingrained in its very being.</p><p>Qin Sang adjusted his approach several times, utilizing the Venomous Pearl in conjunction with his sword.</p><p>Finally, the Gu King wrapped its wings around itself, curling into a ball. Its protective venomous aura formed a sphere, solidifying into a luminous cocoon, sealing itself within.</p><p>"Hu..."</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft breath and examined the cocoon.</p><p>The Cloudroaming Sword remained above, catalyzing sword intent, while the Venomous Pearl transformed into a shimmering haze that enveloped the cocoon.  Only through this dual suppression could the Gu King's ferocity be barely contained.</p><p>The Gu King had autonomously entered a dormant state.</p><p>This state clearly couldn't be considered true subjugation.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't revealed any killing intent, allowing both sides to maintain a strange equilibrium.  If the Gu King sensed a threat to its life, this balance would shatter.</p><p>The Gu King possessed low intelligence and a savage temperament.  Aside from the Strange-Faced Man who nurtured it, no one else could possibly compel its obedience, at least Qin Sang couldn't think of a viable method.</p><p>But having the Venomous Pearl devour the Gu King wouldn't be easy either.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, attempting to urge the Venomous Pearl to emanate an aura of devouring power. The cocoon immediately vibrated, and the Gu King's ferocity nearly reignited.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly withdrew, thinking that maintaining this state was sufficient for now.  He would contemplate further after leaving the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>He flicked his fingers, sending several sword incantations into the Cloudroaming Sword. The spirit sword maintained its sword intent autonomously, requiring no further effort from him. Then, with a thought, he withdrew all three into his body.</p><p>The Venomous Pearl's shimmering haze, encasing the cocoon, returned to his dantian.</p><p>The Cloudroaming Sword resided high in his Purple Mansion, its sword intent reaching his Qi Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind inward, sensing for any abnormalities. Confirming all was well, he ceased paying attention to the Gu King and organized the Strange-Faced Man's miscellaneous belongings, carefully categorizing and storing them.</p><p>His avatar, which had been meditating, had now mostly recovered.</p><p>In this battle, the avatar had repeatedly wielded spirit treasures in coordination with his true body, expending considerable energy. The results, however, were magnificent, especially the gains within the Ice Instrument Palace, making Qin Sang exclaim that the journey was well worth it.</p><p>The avatar handed the Ice-Fire Token and the Water Phase inheritance to his true body, then meticulously depicted the spirit arrays and restrictions from its memory, which the true body stored away for future contemplation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang still planned to divide his forces. His true body would proceed to Emperor Bestowal Mountain first, scouting the situation and preparing to contend for the Nascent Soul opportunity.  His avatar would journey to Fire Rhinoceros Island to search for the Fire-attribute treasure, then rendezvous at Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>This was a necessary measure; neither the Nascent Soul opportunity nor the tribulation-crossing formation could be missed.</p><p>The Nascent Soul opportunity was perhaps even more crucial. How could one speak of crossing tribulation without achieving Nascent Soul?</p><p>The Ice Instrument Divine Disc remained with the avatar, as it might prove useful on Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang gave a Boiling Snow Pill to his avatar and untied the spirit beast pouch from his waist, entrusting the Fire Jade Centipede to his avatar. Having advanced to the early Fourth Transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede's sensing abilities had greatly increased and would likely be helpful in treasure hunting.</p><p>The avatar accepted everything.</p><p>The true body pushed open the cave entrance, flew to the summit, surveyed the surroundings, confirmed there were no anomalies, sent a signal, and headed straight for Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Shortly after the true body's departure, the avatar also left the cave, heading south.</p><p>According to Lang Huan's map, the Fire Phase Hall was located on Fire Rhinoceros Island, south of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The avatar flew through the mountains and forests, occasionally pausing to observe.</p><p>After distancing itself from the Ice Instrument Palace ruins, it shifted course southeast.</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect remained sparsely populated, and even after traveling for a considerable time, the avatar hadn't detected any human presence.</p><p>Restrictions were dense here, ancient trees towered skyward, and the avatar had lost count of the pavilions and towers it had seen along the way.  Countless ancient halls were hidden within the mountains and forests, exuding an air of mystery.</p><p>There might be treasures within them, but compared to the Five Lineages' true inheritances, they paled in comparison. The cultivators who had entered the Formless Immortal Sect at this time wouldn't linger in such places.</p><p>Recalling the geomantic map, the avatar constantly adjusted its direction.</p><p>Finally, after crossing a mountain range, the avatar saw a crimson hue on the horizon, a floating island faintly visible – it was Fire Rhinoceros Island!</p><p>Fire Rhinoceros Island was built upon a Flame Vein.  Its altitude wasn't particularly high, even lower than the mountain beneath the avatar's feet.  Obscured by surrounding mountains and restrictions, it was invisible from a distance.</p><p>The Flame Vein was clearly still active.</p><p>The crimson light that dyed the sky originated from the scarlet magma.</p><p>From afar, the terrain surrounding Fire Rhinoceros Island was unclear, only that it appeared much flatter than other areas, with no visible undulations, suggesting the possible presence of a magma lake.</p><p>Unable to estimate the extent of the Flame Vein, the avatar shifted its gaze to Fire Rhinoceros Island above, scrutinizing it with a surprised expression.</p><p>Fire Rhinoceros Island wasn't entirely floating. Four pillars of fire connected the island's base to the Flame Vein. These pillars, each immensely vast, supported the floating island.</p><p>Focusing its vision, the avatar discovered that the pillars were actually composed of magma.</p><p>Boiling magma flowed upwards from the Flame Vein, pouring into the floating island with astonishing momentum. The four pillars resembled four fire dragons, bearing the weight of Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>Clearly, this was a phenomenon created through the use of formations.</p><p>The grand formation of Fire Rhinoceros Island was in no way inferior to that of the Ice Instrument Palace, yet its state seemed precarious!</p><p>Despite the fire dragons' support, Fire Rhinoceros Island still gave the impression of being on the verge of collapse.</p><p>From this vantage point, the avatar could only see one side of the floating island, but it was evident that numerous red lines crisscrossed its surface – cracks formed by the influx of magma.</p><p>The island had suffered severe damage, and if these cracks expanded, it would shatter completely.</p><p>The southern side of the island had sustained the most damage, its overall shape incomplete, like a circular pie with a large chunk sliced away.</p><p>Magma flowed down the jagged edges of the missing section, forming waterfalls.</p><p>These magma waterfalls resembled crimson curtains.  Two such curtains converged at the island's center, where the fiery streams cascaded downwards, returning to the Flame Vein.</p><p>This indicated that the four fire dragons weren't the entirety of the support structure.</p><p>Analyzing the arrangement of the fire dragons, the avatar deduced that if the island were whole, there would have been at least nine dragons.  Eight dragons would be positioned in the eight cardinal directions, encircling a central dragon, forming a "Nine Dragons Supporting Heaven" formation.</p><p>This meant that the floating island was missing a significant portion, including its most crucial central pillar!</p><p>Witnessing this scene, the avatar's expression darkened, a sense of foreboding washing over it.</p><p>At least the main structure of the Ice Instrument Palace remained intact, its residual formation still partially functional.  Fire Rhinoceros Island was in even worse shape.  Most of the treasures within must have been destroyed.</p><p>Having come this far, there was no turning back.</p><p>It had to go and see for itself.</p><p>With this thought, the avatar descended from the mountaintop and flew towards Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Crossing mountains and valleys, the avatar arrived near the Flame Vein and indeed saw a vast magma lake, its contents churning, the aura of crimson flames exceptionally dense.</p><p>Up close, the sensation was even more intense.</p><p>The avatar tilted its head slightly, observing Fire Rhinoceros Island. The island's dilapidated state was alarming; it was remarkable that it had managed to persist until now.</p><p>Crimson flame energy surged, waves of heat washing over the avatar.  Cultivating ice-based techniques, it found the sensation uncomfortable, though not debilitating.</p><p>It shifted its gaze towards the point where the two magma waterfalls converged.</p><p>The layout of Fire Rhinoceros Island was easy to guess.  The central palace position above the core pillar was undoubtedly the most important location.  However, that area was awash in crimson, magma seething, making it impossible to discern whether anything remained.</p><p>Of the four remaining fire dragons, one was situated southeast, while the other three formed an arc in the northern half of the island, where the island was most intact.</p><p>Despite its proximity, the avatar didn't sense the same powerful pressure as the ethereal blue light of the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>This implied that the damage to Fire Rhinoceros Island's formation was even more severe than anticipated.</p><p>It couldn't help but wonder if merely flying onto the island would cause it to collapse, plunging it into the magma below.</p><p>The avatar carefully observed the four fire dragons, noticing that the flow of energy between them wasn't tightly knit. Each dragon seemed self-contained, revealing a key insight into the island's formation.</p><p>Each fire dragon was formed by an independent formation. The nine fire dragons represented nine grand formations, serving not only to support the island but also likely acting as pillars of the overall formation.</p><p>This explained why these four dragons could still exist despite the collapse of the main formation and the destruction of the other dragons.</p><p>This news was both good and bad.</p><p>The good news was that the avatar wouldn't encounter significant resistance while searching for treasures on the island.</p><p>The bad news was that the central palace of Fire Rhinoceros Island was likely in ruins, with little remaining.</p><p>The avatar's gaze shifted to the northwest of Fire Rhinoceros Island, where a crimson rope connected the edge of the Flame Vein to the island.</p><p>The crimson rope wasn't a physical object but composed of interconnected rings of fire, each ring constantly shifting into various shapes of fire spirits and divine beasts, a truly wondrous sight.</p><p>Similar crimson ropes existed in other directions, some broken, others precariously clinging, likely serving as paths to the island.</p><p>During the avatar's observation, Fire Rhinoceros Island and its surroundings remained unchanged, suggesting no one else was nearby, which was a relief.</p><p>The avatar's mind eased slightly.  With a series of flashes, it flew around the magma lake, arriving at the northwestern crimson rope, tentatively stepping onto it.</p><p>Simultaneously, it released the true essence locking its sleeve, from which emerged a streak of crimson-gold light – the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After its transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede appeared much more imposing than before.</p><p>Holding the Fire Jade Centipede in its palm, the avatar grasped the mysterious ice disc in its other hand.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the crimson rope showed no reaction.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, just released, snapped to attention, its body suddenly stiffening as it stared intently at Fire Rhinoceros Island.  It began to buzz excitedly, its hundred legs twitching, eager to rush towards the island.</p><p>If the avatar hadn't restrained it, it would have instantly shot off like a golden streak.</p><p>"Hold on!"</p><p>The avatar hurriedly suppressed the Fire Jade Centipede with true essence, looking at Fire Rhinoceros Island in astonishment.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's reaction was unprecedentedly intense, indicating there were still valuable items on the island. Seeing its eagerness, what kind of treasure could it be?</p><p>The avatar, too, felt anticipation, but it understood that unlike the Ice Instrument Palace, the ice disc couldn't protect it from the restrictions here. It couldn't be reckless.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, forcibly restrained, was clearly displeased.  Its hundred legs scraped restlessly against the avatar's palm, its body twisting and turning, its carapace clicking and clacking. It seemed as though it wanted to bite its master.</p><p>The avatar chuckled, shaking its head as it stepped forward along the crimson rope.</p><p>'Clang, clang, clang...'</p><p>The rope swayed.  Though not a physical entity, it emitted the sound of colliding metal.</p><p>Listening closely, a faint bell-like chime could be heard from the end of the rope.</p><p>The avatar paused, seeing no danger, and continued briskly along the rope.  Looking down, it saw the magma churning below, flowing like a tide.</p><p>After walking for a while, it reached the end of the rope.</p><p>Here was a platform constructed from a valuable type of fire jade. The avatar stepped onto the platform, still encountering no restrictive attacks, a more welcoming experience than the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>The scene on the island could be described as utter devastation.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, the avatar saw swaths of spirit trees with leaves as large as cattails.  They were a well-known type of Fire Cattail Tree, which thrived in crimson flames, an indispensable resource for Fire-attribute cultivators crafting talismans and magical instruments.</p><p>Their primary use was in spirit arrays.  Their thick leaf veins extended directly to their root systems, interconnected and spreading in all directions like the meridians of heaven and earth, effectively channeling crimson flame energy.</p><p>The denser the crimson flame energy, the more vibrant the Fire Cattail Trees became.</p><p>Magma flowed freely across Fire Rhinoceros Island, paradoxically promoting their growth.</p><p>The Fire Cattail forest was haphazardly distributed.  Roots and stems intertwined across paths carved from fire jade, and magma covered the ground, leaving no place to step.</p><p>This was the result of severe damage and subsequent uncontrolled growth.</p><p>Untended, the Fire Cattail Trees were exceptionally dense, their leaves twice their normal size, obscuring the buildings within.</p><p>With the Fire Jade Centipede leading the way, the avatar didn't need to discern the direction itself.  Slightly loosening its true essence control, it observed the Fire Jade Centipede burrowing straight ahead.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the object attracting it was located in the central palace.</p><p>The avatar summoned the Snowtreading Divine Saber, suspending it above its head, and stepped off the platform.</p><p>After only a few steps, a surge of magma erupted from a fissure in the ground, instantly transforming into a crescent-shaped blade of fire that slashed towards the avatar. If this strike connected, it would cleave the avatar in two.</p><p>The avatar, however, was prepared.  Its body leaned back slightly, and with a swing of the Snowtreading Divine Saber, it unleashed a frigid burst of saber energy that collided squarely with the fire blade.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The saber energy and the fire blade annihilated each other.</p><p>The surrounding crimson flame energy surged, the Fire Cattail Trees shaking violently, nearly snapping.  The ground trembled from the impact.</p><p>The avatar's expression grew serious.  This was the result of its impeccable control.  Directly confronting the restrictions wouldn't be difficult, but a few more such clashes might destabilize the floating island's energy flow, leading to unforeseen consequences.</p><p>Analyzing the formations step-by-step would consume too much time.</p><p>Pondering for a moment, the avatar recalled the Fire Jade Centipede's past behavior.  An idea struck it, and it released a portion of its true essence control, allowing the Fire Jade Centipede to lead the way.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Finally free, the Fire Jade Centipede sprang forward.</p><p>A golden streak weaved through the Fire Cattail Trees, vanishing a hundred zhang in an instant, without triggering any restrictive attacks.</p><p>A smile appeared on the avatar's face.</p><p>The formations here were fragmented and distorted. The gaps between the restrictions formed natural pathways, perfect for the Fire Jade Centipede to exploit.  Of course, bringing the Heaven's Eye Butterfly would have been even more effective.</p><p>The avatar flashed after the Fire Jade Centipede, weaving through the forest.</p><p>Although it still inevitably triggered some restrictions and was attacked, they remained within a manageable range.</p><p>Before long, the avatar saw a cluster of palaces appear among the trees. Their foundations were submerged in magma, and collapsed ruins were everywhere, a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede showed no sign of stopping, its body wriggling as it darted over the rubble of a palace!</p>
