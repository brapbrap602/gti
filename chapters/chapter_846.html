<h1>Chapter 838: The Golden Light Formation</h1><p>Chapter 838: The Golden Light Formation</p><p>“Will we abandon the island?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>This beast tide was unusually relentless, besieging Yu Heng Island for days, with no decrease in numbers.  The powerful demons behind it seemed determined to utterly destroy the island.</p><p>The beast tide encountered at Wu Yuan Island was insignificant compared to this.</p><p>“Let me take over.  You should all quickly recover your strength.”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke, taking control of the array and using its power to slaughter the demonic beasts. He wasn't sure how much longer the formation could hold, so he had to prepare for the worst.</p><p>“It should be noon now, the sun should be shining brightly, and the scenery exceptionally beautiful.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, but the sky was completely obscured by flying demonic beasts; nothing was visible.</p><p>Time slipped away, each moment a torment.</p><p>Several more days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang had retreated into the city. The outer defensive formations had been breached one after another, the protective barrier shrinking.  Many cultivators were caught off guard when the barrier broke, swallowed by the beast tide, and quickly disappeared without a trace – their survival unlikely.</p><p>However, the barrier was still relatively stable because the powerful demons hadn’t appeared. Even if something unexpected happened, others could quickly respond.</p><p>“Why aren’t the powerful demons showing themselves? What are they waiting for?”</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>This wasn't just Qin Sang's question.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang handed over the array to others and immediately meditated to recover his strength.  He had been working tirelessly for days and felt exhausted.</p><p>Shortly after beginning his meditation, a message scroll suddenly flew in and landed in his lap.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled awake, opened the scroll, and his expression immediately changed.</p><p>The surrounding cultivators looked over.</p><p>“The island master has decided to abandon the island, and we should all flee for our lives!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, silently saying this, and passed the message down.</p><p>His words caused an uproar.</p><p>After days of fighting, everyone knew how terrifying the beast tide was. The island's protective formation was their only hope. If they abandoned the island, few cultivators would survive the breakout.</p><p>“Don’t panic. Look at the contents of the message. The island master has other arrangements. At the last moment, he will detonate the formation’s full power, creating escape routes on all sides…”</p><p>Qin Sang reassured everyone.</p><p>The message explained that the island master had been searching for the powerful demons behind the beast tide for the past few days, but to no avail. Those demons seemed to anticipate something and were hiding well.</p><p>As long as the powerful demons didn't attack, the formation wouldn't be breached. However, if they were constantly worn down by the beast tide until the island’s spirit stones were depleted and the cultivators exhausted, escape would become impossible.</p><p>The island master had originally planned to use a killing formation to severely damage the powerful demons and break up the beast tide.  Now he could only take a less effective approach.</p><p>At the last moment, the island master would personally control the formation, killing as many demons as possible that showed themselves, and concentrate the formation's power to create escape routes in all directions.  Then the cultivators could take advantage of the chaos of the beast tide to break out, greatly increasing their chances of survival.</p><p>The island master, decisive as ever, set the breakout time for that night, in one hour!</p><p>After seeing the contents of the message, everyone understood the formation's incredible ability. Their initial panic lessened, but they still remained worried.</p><p>Breaking out individually meant relying on fate, including the island master himself, who might be attacked by a powerful demon.</p><p>Shortly after receiving this message, Jin Ying sent a message, inviting Qin Sang to join them and break out together.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then decided against it, opting to act alone!</p><p>He considered himself strong, with far superior escape speed. Unless he encountered a powerful demon or a group of high-level demons, his chances of being trapped were low.</p><p>Another reason was the message's content – the island master would focus on the demons that appeared and create escape routes, making the breakout less stressful.  Acting alone offered more flexibility; going with the merchant alliance might hinder him.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had another concern.</p><p>As an outsider, who would be abandoned first in a crisis?</p><p>Qin Sang replied, declining the invitation, then hesitated, adding to his message that if the two women wished, they could break out together.</p><p>Escaping the beast tide didn't guarantee safety; they still had to cross the vast demon sea to find a safe island. Having a companion would increase their chances.</p><p>Unfortunately, after a while, Qin Sang received a reply, expressing regret at his refusal and stating that they would act with the merchant alliance's experts, wishing him safety.</p><p>The merchant alliance was filled with experts; their choice was reasonable, and Qin Sang said no more, wishing them safe passage.</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the shock and lengthy debate between Madam Liu and Jin Ying after learning of his decision.  Less than an hour remained.  A heavy tension hung over the city; everyone's fate uncertain, unsure if they'd see another sunrise.  Qin Sang prepared for the breakout, awaiting midnight.</p><p>…</p><p>Midnight.</p><p>Without warning, the array Qin Sang controlled emitted a dazzling light.  An intense suction followed, draining his spiritual energy at an alarming rate.  His expression shifted slightly, but he didn't resist, calmly instructing others to remain calm.  Simultaneously, the spirit stones powering the main array in the center were completely depleted, reduced to fragments—including high-grade stones.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The array shattered before Qin Sang, the suction ceasing. He breathed a sigh of relief, checked his dantian, and quickly swallowed several restorative pills.  A golden light leaped from the broken array, shimmering briefly before shooting skyward.  At the same moment, golden lights erupted across the city.</p><p>A breathtaking sight unfolded.</p><p>Countless golden streams soared, converged, and bathed the city in a golden radiance.  Qin Sang looked up, then his gaze shifted; he focused on the protective barrier.  As sword-like shadows appeared, the barrier's strength waned, becoming thin and dim.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, his figure launching towards the array's edge like a released arrow.  The others finally reacted.</p><p>Instantly, countless escape lights flashed in all directions.</p><p>The beasts, momentarily stunned by the array's change, sensed the weakening barrier.  With a roar, they attacked ferociously, their covetous gazes fixed on the cultivators.  Screams immediately followed.</p><p>The golden light from the array displayed astonishing power.  The exposed large demons were almost simultaneously struck, suffering death or grievous injury.  Chaos erupted within the beast tide.</p><p>This was far from over.  The other golden lights converged into four streams within the city, like golden rivers, piercing the beast tide in four directions the moment the barrier shattered.</p><p>The golden array unleashed its final, brilliant display, transforming into a devastating vortex.  Gaping wounds were torn through the beast tide, and the cultivators surged out of the city.</p>
