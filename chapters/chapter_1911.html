<h1>Chapter 1902: Cloud City Mountain</h1><p>Qin Sang flew effortlessly on a cloud, his speed neither fast nor slow.  Guanyu Zhu was only a hair's breadth from becoming a Yuan Ying cultivator; his so-called enlightenment was a mere trifle.</p><p>The mountains and rivers below stretched out beneath him.  Ordinary people, tiny as ants, lived their lives, seemingly unchanged from a century ago.</p><p>Remembering Guanyu Zhu's descriptions of the geography, Qin Sang looked east, seeking a master alchemist.  To refine the Yinghua Pill with a reasonable success rate, the alchemist would need to be at least at the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>To find such a cultivator, he needed to travel east. Legend spoke of a sacred mountain in the east, Cloud City Mountain, said to be the source of the world's spiritual veins, a place where immortals gathered.</p><p>Guanyu Zhu had warned him that to the west lay sparsely populated lands and treacherous mountain ranges, home to many immortal mountains and spiritual streams, but also to numerous demons and wicked cultivators; battles were frequent, and the situation was incredibly chaotic.</p><p>Guanyu Zhu, himself only at the Golden Core stage, had limited vision due to his cultivation level. Still, Qin Sang could form a rough estimate of his surroundings based on his words.</p><p>To truly understand this cultivation world and its place in the vast universe, he first needed to go to Cloud City Mountain. So Qin Sang followed the Lihu Lake shore, flying directly east.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw the eastern bank of Lihu Lake. It wasn't the end; the lake was just part of a massive water system. A great river flowed eastward from the bank. According to the Yan Shui Temple's records, following the river east would lead to Cloud City Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hurry or hide his tracks; he simply rode a white cloud through the sky.</p><p>“Demon spirits, city gods, land gods, immortal cultivators…”</p><p>Without even consciously expanding his spiritual awareness, Qin Sang sensed the extraordinary energies along his path.</p><p>He saw ordinary people hunting in the mountains, their careless actions angering a mountain demon, leading to them being swallowed whole.</p><p>He saw vicious demons attempting to attack villages to feed, only to be killed by city gods summoned by the land gods.</p><p>He also saw cultivators wielding swords, slaying demons and saving oppressed mountain gods.</p><p>He even saw a clever wolf demon, sharing drinks and poetry with two cultivators and a mountain god.</p><p>There were newly intelligent minor demons carefully exploring the world; deities residing in temples, protecting mortals; and cultivators dedicated to their cultivation, uncaring of worldly affairs.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but exclaim, “What a vast world!”</p><p>Overall, this place was undoubtedly much more peaceful than other cultivation worlds.</p><p>But one thing was undeniable: the spiritual energy here couldn't compare to Cloud City Mountain.</p><p>Would Cloud City Mountain be the same?</p><p>The white cloud drifted.</p><p>After passing numerous rivers and lakes, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He dissipated the cloud beneath him and gently descended towards a mountain peak below.</p><p>This mountain was far from civilization, rarely visited.  A market town, Hongshan Market, nestled within.</p><p>Hongshan Market was backed by an immortal sect that opened its doors for half a month every six months.  This sect had a Yuan Ying cultivator as its leader, known for fairness and justice.  As such, Hongshan Market was well-known in the area; even gods and demons came to trade, and as long as they didn't feed on humans, they weren't discriminated against.</p><p>Guanyu Zhu was a regular at Hongshan Market; he obtained much of his outside information there.</p><p>Before leaving, Guanyu Zhu gave Qin Sang a name card to facilitate his dealings in the market.</p><p>It just happened to be market day.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on a rock outside the market, choosing not to use Guanyu Zhu's name card. Instead, he released an aura comparable to a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>Moments later, the market reacted. A rainbow light shot out, paused slightly, and then quickly flew towards him.  An old man appeared, the master of Hongshan Market, known as Lu Yangsou.</p><p>Seeing the unfamiliar face and the cultivation that was no weaker than his own, Lu Yangsou's demeanor was guarded.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed unfazed, fabricating a story to explain his purpose: “I have long heard that Cloud City Mountain is a sacred land of immortals, with countless high-level cultivators. I wish to go there to obtain a spiritual pill, but I am unfamiliar with the place and fear I might inadvertently offend some taboo.  Passing by your esteemed establishment, I humbly ask for your guidance.”</p><p>Hearing this, Lu Yangsou's expression softened slightly. He pondered for a moment, then said, “I dare ask, what level of pill are you seeking, Daoist Qingfeng? I happen to be acquainted with several masters of alchemy, and I could introduce you.”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke frankly, “Thank you, Daoist friend! But this pill is rare; I fear only a Divine Transformation alchemist can refine it.”</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Lu Yangsou's eyes as he shook his head and chuckled wryly,  “I see, no wonder you've come from so far away. To refine such a pill, you will have to try your luck in Cloud Peak City.”</p><p>"Cloud Pinnacle City?"</p><p>Qin Sang questioned, "Is it in the Cloud Capital Mountains?"</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>Lu Yangsou nodded.  "The immortal cities in the Cloud Capital Mountains often have 'Cloud' in their names. Among the many immortal cities, Cloud Pinnacle City is extremely famous.  It's known throughout the Cloud Capital Mountains, a veritable sacred ground of alchemy. The city lord is a Nascent Soul stage cultivator, a master alchemist. Many alchemists come seeking their name, and enjoy protection and high status within the city.  It's said that even Cloud Capital Heaven shows the city lord great respect, but getting the city lord's attention isn't easy…"</p><p>While explaining, Lu Yangsou produced a jade slip containing a map of part of the Cloud Capital Mountains, marking the locations of several immortal cities and sects.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him and used his spiritual sense to examine it.</p><p>The so-called 'Cloud Capital Heaven' refers to a major immortal sect within the Cloud Capital Mountains—the sect's name is Cloud Capital Mountain!</p><p>No one knows for sure whether the mountain was named after the sect or vice versa.</p><p>To distinguish it and show respect, cultivators in the Cloud Capital Mountains refer to it as 'Heaven,' calling it Cloud Capital Heaven.</p><p>Cloud Capital Heaven deserves this title.  It's not only the largest sect in the Cloud Capital Mountains, but its main peak, piercing the clouds, is inaccessible to ordinary mortals, appearing to be in the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang studied the map carefully, lost in thought.</p><p>"A Nascent Soul cultivator can control an immortal city, protect other alchemists, and receive respect from Cloud Capital Heaven. Their alchemic skills must be extraordinary.  But this also shows that Nascent Soul cultivators are powerful figures in the Cloud Capital Mountains. Does this mean Cloud Capital Heaven only has Void Refinement cultivators as its leaders?"</p><p>The vast world can't possibly have only Unity and Mahayana cultivators everywhere. Perhaps this cultivation world he's landed in is relatively remote.</p><p>"Thank you, friend."</p><p>Qin Sang insisted on paying.</p><p>This map must be a treasured possession of Lu Yangsou's sect. The world of cultivation is unpredictable; creating such a map is risky.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Lu Yangsou, Qin Sang soared into the sky.</p><p>Lu Yangsou watched the departing light, noticing nothing unusual, regarding it as a minor incident.</p><p>Having obtained the map and seen the local sights, Qin Sang increased his speed, heading straight for Cloud Pinnacle City.</p><p>He flew over countless mountains and rivers.</p><p>The mountains became noticeably steeper, the rivers fiercer, unsuitable for ordinary people.</p><p>The population gradually thinned; forming nations became impossible.</p><p>Correspondingly, spiritual energy became increasingly dense, and cultivators and cultivation sects grew more numerous.</p><p>He flew over more countless mountains and ridges.</p><p>"It truly lives up to the name, Cloud Capital Mountain."</p><p>Qin Sang marveled silently. Even before reaching the heartland, the mountains were enveloped in white mist, with the cloud caps on the mountain peaks perpetually present, merging with the mist, as if all the mountain ranges were shrouded in a sea of clouds, no wonder it's considered a fairyland.</p><p>Between the clouds and mist, the mountain shadows were hazy, fresh, and natural.</p><p>In the Cloud Capital Mountains, the main peak in the heartland is occupied by Cloud Capital Heaven, while other sects and immortal cities occupy their respective spiritual peaks, surrounding Cloud Capital Heaven.</p><p>The vastness of the Cloud Capital Mountains far surpasses ordinary imagination.</p><p>Part of Qin Sang's amazement stemmed from this. He estimated that the flight from Hongshan Market to this point was equivalent to traversing the entire Central Plains of the Storm Realm; he hadn't even reached the so-called heartland of the Cloud Capital Mountains, and didn't yet know how large that truly was.</p><p>Cultivators inside and outside the mountains all depended on Cloud Capital Heaven.  One sect, so vast.</p><p>The vast world, truly lives up to its name!</p><p>Cloud Pinnacle City was also located in the heartland of the Cloud Capital Mountains, but on the edge, northwest of Cloud Capital Heaven.</p><p>After another burst of speed, the mist didn't become denser. Qin Sang thought for a moment, maintained the aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator, and flew towards Cloud Pinnacle City at a leisurely pace.</p><p>Reaching the area marked on the map, Qin Sang found that the mist in the mountains had disappeared, all rising to form a sky-covering canopy.</p><p>From all directions, mist was continuously drawn upwards.  Qin Sang glanced around and saw a cloud path formed by formations within the canopy. He flew up and walked along the path.</p><p>Above the cloud canopy, the sky was a clear azure, like walking in the heavens.</p><p>These cloud paths connected in all directions, converging towards the center.  Qin Sang soon encountered fellow travelers.</p><p>As Lu Yangsou had said, Cloud Pinnacle City was famous, and many cultivators came seeking pills; soon the cloud path became bustling.</p><p>When he finally saw Cloud Pinnacle City in its entirety, Qin Sang couldn't help but show a look of surprise.</p><p>The city's shape was indeed a giant cloud tripod!</p><p>The giant tripod sat in the sea of clouds, its walls forming the city walls, but they were镂空的 , allowing a glimpse inside.</p><p>The people of the city lived inside the tripod.</p><p>Cloud bridges crisscrossed within, and the palaces and pavilions seemed to be built of white clouds, a sea of white with other colors merely as accents.</p><p>A cloud-connected city, layered like a tiered cake, rose before Qin Sang.  Each level, intricately designed, rested upon the one below; the lowest level sat atop a mountain peak, while the upper levels seemed to float amidst the clouds, their mystery deepening with altitude.  The scene reminded Qin Sang of the Thunder City in the Divine Court.</p><p>Standing before the south gate of Yun Ding City, Qin Sang noted the lax security.  Yun Ding City housed many alchemists, their livelihood dependent on trade, thus the open access.</p><p>As expected, his approach drew attention.  A guard captain approached, bowing respectfully.  "Respected senior, have you come seeking elixirs?"</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang replied, nodding.</p><p>"The City Lord has decreed that cultivators at the Transformation God stage may proceed directly to the sixth level. Please, go ahead."</p><p>Yun Ding City comprised seven levels, the seventh being the City Lord's residence.</p><p>The guard captain's tone was deferential.  With Qin Sang's assent, he led the way.  Nearby cultivators watched, speculating about Qin Sang's identity, but dared not stare.</p><p>Qin Sang remained composed, following the captain through the city.  He admired the scenery, ascending to the sixth level before he realized it.</p><p>From his vantage point, he could only see the lower levels vaguely, indicating the presence of concealing formations.</p><p>The city had evidently been informed of his arrival.  The captain led Qin Sang into a grand hall where a cultivator awaited.</p><p>"Nascent Soul stage."</p><p>Qin Sang instantly assessed the cultivator's realm.  The insignia on his robes indicated high standing within Yun Ding City.</p><p>The cultivator, a man with a square face, wore a white robe emblazoned with a small cauldron on the chest. His demeanor was steady and reassuring.</p><p>Dismissing the guards, he bowed deeply.  "Junior Fan Ru Gui, fourth disciple of my master, greets senior."</p><p>"I am Qingfeng," Qin Sang replied directly.  "I seek elixirs. Might I request the honor of your master personally undertaking the refinement?"</p><p>Fan Ru Gui remained noncommittal.  "May I ask what elixir you desire, senior? My master is currently refining elixirs and is occupied. If your request requires my master's personal attention, I shall inform him."</p><p>"The elixir I seek, I believe, is unfamiliar to you.  Here is the formula; I have also gathered some of the necessary herbs…"</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade slip and handed it to Fan Ru Gui.</p><p>Hearing it was an unknown formula, Fan Ru Gui maintained composure outwardly, though inwardly skeptical.  Yet, upon examining the jade slip, he became engrossed, utterly captivated.</p><p>Qin Sang observed Fan Ru Gui for a while, then smiled.  "My words were not exaggerated, were they?"</p><p>Fan Ru Gui, startled from his trance, showed undisguised excitement.  "This formula… this formula…"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned concern.  "Is there a problem with this formula, Daoist Fan? I found it in an ancient text, purportedly of Witch Clan origin and vastly different from human methods. I was worried that human alchemists couldn't refine it. Was it just a fabrication?"</p><p>"No! No! No!"</p><p>Fan Ru Gui vehemently shook his head.  "Some herbs have names different from those used today, but the formula itself is flawless.  The principles...it's the legendary Witch Clan tradition! That explains it! That explains it!"</p><p>The legendary Witch Clan!</p><p>Qin Sang pressed on.  "Has Yun Ding City never encountered a Witch Clan formula before?"</p><p>"This is indeed the first time," Fan Ru Gui replied honestly.  "We are grateful to you for bringing this formula, senior.  We learn of this branch of alchemy today. My master will be delighted."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Even here, the Witch Clan was legendary.  Unless the Witch Clan had declined in the vast world, or this region was isolated like the Talisman Realm, this truly was a remote location.</p><p>It seemed finding Liu Ying and Gui Mu would take longer than anticipated.</p><p>"Very well.  I wonder if the star platform on Witch God Mountain leads to the Witch Clan. What if the person I attracted was a Witch Clan Mahayana cultivator related to Gui Mu, only to be slain by the First Sword Servant and Zhang Zhenjun on the River of Misfortune? How would I explain that to her?"</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the thought and continued, "Since it's a Witch Clan tradition, are you confident in success, Daoist Fan?"</p><p>Fan Ru Gui replied readily, "Rest assured, senior. My master's alchemy is unparalleled in Yun Du Mountain. He will certainly succeed!  Moreover, my master has a policy: for those presenting a new formula, the first refinement is free of charge. After that, the fee is halved with each subsequent refinement. The city will also assist in procuring the necessary herbs, but the cost of herbs and materials will be the responsibility of the requester."</p><p>A new formula was always a draw for alchemists; Master Ling Xu wasn't solely acting out of obligation.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, presenting a storage pouch.  "I have only gathered this much.  I hope your master will help acquire what's missing."</p><p></p><p>I am a stranger in a foreign land, with no intention of becoming an immortal.</p><p>After twenty years of secluded cultivation in the deep mountains, my master sent me, Song You, down the mountain to witness the wonders and woes of the world, to explore the famous mountains and rivers, and to find the legendary immortals. He said that was true cultivation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after traveling throughout the land, I found that the immortal was myself.</p>
