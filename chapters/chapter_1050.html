<h1>Chapter 142: The Seizure</h1><p>Heaven's thunder descended.</p><p>The lightning was blinding.</p><p>The divine thunder targeted Elder Ye.</p><p>Elder Ye was caught completely off guard.  After delivering a powerful strike that stunned everyone, he hadn't anticipated a surprise attack.</p><p>There couldn't be another Yuan Ying master here. Someone was audacious enough to snatch food from a tiger's mouth.</p><p>Qin Sang chose his moment perfectly;  just as Elder Ye unleashed his full power, battling the restrictions of the secret realm, before his strength could recover, striking him at his weakest point.</p><p>This lightning technique was undoubtedly a top-tier Daoist art, a closely guarded secret in any sect.  It couldn't be unknown in the cultivation world, yet Elder Ye, a man of vast knowledge, had never heard of it.</p><p>The power of this lightning control far surpassed that of a nascent soul cultivator. Elder Ye dared not be careless; he even felt a threat to his life!</p><p>"BOOM!"</p><p>The cavern trembled.</p><p>The earth spirits around Elder Ye were shattered, his figure swallowed by the brilliant electric light.</p><p>Witnessing this, the cultivators stood dumbfounded, a sense of unreality washing over them. They wondered if this wasn't a trial at all, if they'd somehow wandered into the wrong place.</p><p>Otherwise, why the continuous appearance of overpowered opponents?</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Just as Elder Ye was ambushed by the lightning technique, and the cultivators were overwhelmed by the succession of mysterious opponents and the unpredictable situation, not knowing what to do.</p><p>A grey shadow suddenly darted from the army of earth spirits, seizing the opportunity to enter the sealed area before everyone's eyes.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A ghostly hand shot out, grabbing for the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>This person clearly had planned this beforehand; their movements were smooth and swift.  In an instant, all four bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid were snatched away, and the figure retreated.</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>Elder Ye roared from within the electric light.</p><p>Bai was the one who had taken the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>He and Qin Sang had split up, hiding and waiting for their moment, coordinating closely.  Qin Sang launched the surprise attack on Elder Ye, and while he was distracted, Bai seized the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Xue Fu and the others were severely wounded and unable to participate in the struggle.</p><p>The rest of the crowd was leaderless, intimidated by Elder Ye, and dared not intervene. For a moment, no one interfered.</p><p>With the Soul Cleansing Liquid in hand, Bai immediately turned and charged towards Qin Sang's location. Hearing Elder Ye's powerful roar, Bai's heart tightened.</p><p>Qin Sang's caution was justified; these old ghosts were indeed formidable.  Even with their cultivation restricted,  a mere lightning technique couldn't possibly kill Elder Ye.</p><p>Elder Ye's roar drowned out the thunder, deafening.</p><p>The elder with the long beard and the others understood this order was directed at them.</p><p>When they saw Elder Ye effortlessly disable Xue Fu and others, and easily break the seal to take the Soul Cleansing Liquid, their hearts had been filled with boundless joy.</p><p>But when the lightning technique appeared and Elder Ye was engulfed by thunder, seemingly helpless, his life hanging in the balance, their joy plummeted into despair.</p><p>They were behind Elder Ye and clearly sensed the terrifying power of the lightning technique.</p><p>And Elder Ye, his cultivation restricted, injured, and exhausted after his attack, how could he possibly withstand it?</p><p>What if Elder Ye…</p><p>They were terrified and at a loss, not daring to think further.</p><p>Hearing Elder Ye's voice, the elder with the long beard and the others finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Master is alright!"</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>After the overwhelming joy, anger surged.</p><p>The opponent not only attacked their master but also stole their Soul Cleansing Liquid!</p><p>The four of them had prepared their flag formation, ready to assist Elder Ye in retreating from the cavern, and it was perfect for dealing with Bai.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The banners fluttered.</p><p>An endless glow, auspicious clouds, emanated from the spirit flags.</p><p>This flag formation was mysterious, imposing, and powerful.</p><p>"Put down the Soul Cleansing Liquid!"</p><p>The elder with the long beard was furious, his long beard flying, when he suddenly felt the formation falter.</p><p>He glanced over and saw Su Nu clutching a spirit flag, looking at Elder Ye's direction with terror and sorrow, frozen in place.</p><p>"Junior Sister!"</p><p>The elder with the long beard roared.</p><p>Su Nu shuddered, meeting his gaze. Her eyes were dazed, as if just regaining consciousness. Her face flushed, and she frantically manipulated the spirit flag.</p><p>The more panicked she got, the more mistakes she made.</p><p>The elder with the long beard sighed; Su Nu was clearly traumatized by what she'd witnessed, fearing the worst for Elder Ye.</p><p>Her three siblings had traveled extensively for years, gaining considerable experience.  In such a situation, they would have reacted instantly.</p><p>Only Su Nu had been cultivating in the Dongji Alliance, sheltered by the alliance leader and Elder Ye, never encountering any danger, never facing anyone audacious enough to provoke her.</p><p>The cost was a wealth of cultivation, but combat experience perhaps no better than a newly-formed Golden Core cultivator. In crucial moments, he didn't know what to do.</p><p>Hampered by Su Nu, the forced activation of the flag array created numerous flaws.</p><p>The three elders, all decisive individuals, realized Su Nu was unreliable. They immediately abandoned the spirit flags, activated their magic treasures, and closed in on Bai.</p><p>Bai sneered, flung out an arm, and hurled a bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid, enveloped in corpse energy.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>All eyes were on it.</p><p>Cultivators in that direction stirred.</p><p>Taking advantage of the conflict between the others, some bold cultivators prepared to intervene.</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid shimmered with faint lights, seemingly about to escape right before the three elders' eyes.</p><p>Although the three elders knew it was a ploy, they were still momentarily distracted. The alluring woman couldn't help but flick her sleeve, sending a ribbon of energy towards the liquid.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Bai's speed didn't decrease; corpse energy boiled around him as he forced his way through.</p><p>*Liiit!*</p><p>A crane's cry came from behind, a fierce wind followed.  The strong man felt a chill down his spine, disregarded everything else, and swung his blade back to strike.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Bai clashed with the elder.</p><p>The crane, cunningly, dodged beforehand. Knowing it was no match for the strong man, it avoided a direct confrontation, drawing the strong man's attention being enough.</p><p>In that fleeting moment, another figure appeared – Qin Sang.</p><p>He used the *Thunder Control Technique*, instantly losing 70-80% of his cultivation. The task of seizing the treasure fell to Bai. Qin Sang swallowed a spirit pill and immediately came to his aid.</p><p>The crane and Bai both pounced, then their figures flickered. One disappeared into the corpse puppet bag, while the other transformed into a Unity Ring, encircling Qin Sang's wrist.</p><p>Before the elders could close in,</p><p>Three-colored escaping light erupted from Qin Sang.</p><p>Images of a dragon, phoenix wings, and sword light intertwined brilliantly.</p><p>"Not good! Stop him!"</p><p>The elder felt a sense of foreboding and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>The strong man acted more directly, slashing out with his blade, the blade's glow dazzling, reminiscent of Master Ye, clearly showing he was a true disciple.</p><p>Alas, they were too slow.</p><p>Qin Sang’s escape technique proved devastating, instantly breaking through the encirclement and leaving them far behind.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>Master Ye roared in fury. Qin Sang felt a surge of blood, secretly shocked.</p><p>He caught a glimpse of the lightning striking Master Ye, cracking inch by inch!</p>
