<h1>Chapter 1898 Slay the Self!</h1><p>A world of enemies!</p><p>Qin Sang was silent.</p><p>No wonder the First Sword Attendant hadn't bothered with enticements or threats. This was the greatest threat of all.</p><p>He was already deeply marked by the Purple Star Emperor's brand, something unchangeable by his own will.</p><p>At least for now, the First Sword Attendant and Heavenly Voyager hadn't harmed him, instead bestowing upon him numerous opportunities.</p><p>Without them, he couldn't have so smoothly reached the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>The First Sword Attendant's expression was calm and unruffled, as if she had just made a jest.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts, exhaled softly, and continued, "Senior, how do you plan to arrange for me? Continued shelter under the Celestial Court, or a return to the previous realm, hiding within a Minor Thousand World, quietly cultivating, awaiting the opportune moment?"</p><p>"The Celestial Court can barely protect itself, let alone you. As for the previous realm, you can no longer return…"</p><p>The First Sword Attendant pondered for a moment before saying, "His final decision to send the Sword Pavilion and his佩sword into this realm must have had a hidden reason. This realm is definitely not an ordinary Minor Thousand World.  Back then, I was drawn here, attempting to approach, but felt a faint unease, an instinctive sense of threat and apprehension. My perception was greatly affected, and I dared not force my way in. It took a long time to locate the Emperor's sword. In the end, to stop you, I had no choice but to risk taking action. Without the guidance of the Emperor's sword's aura, I would have long lost track of this realm…"</p><p>As expected!</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the events of that time, yet one question remained unanswered.</p><p>The First Sword Attendant was at least a Grand Completion stage expert. Yet, to find the Sword Spirit, she used such a crude method, only able to call out across the void.</p><p>Breaking through the realm barrier and searching a whole world wouldn't take much effort for her, would it?</p><p>It couldn't be that a Grand Completion stage expert would be suppressed by the Heavenly Dao of a Minor Thousand World upon entering, could it?</p><p>Moreover, Heavenly Voyager had clearly known the First Sword Attendant for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that Heavenly Voyager had once received swordsmanship inheritance in the Immortal Hall, or what the First Sword Attendant called the 'Sword Pavilion,' which caught her attention, and he might even have become her disciple.</p><p>In that case, why didn't Heavenly Voyager tell her the location of the Storm Realm?</p><p>There was only one possibility: after ascending, Heavenly Voyager couldn't find the way back either!</p><p>That's why no one who ascended ever returned to the Storm Realm.</p><p>"Neither the First Sword Attendant nor Heavenly Voyager can find the Storm Realm. What can I do? Liu Li, Green Goat Temple, the friends I left behind in the Storm Realm…"</p><p>A look of melancholy filled Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>He had believed that Mount Ju's Healing Altar led to the Storm Realm and had tirelessly explored it, trying to find a way back, to fulfill the promise he made.</p><p>Unexpectedly, that path simply didn't exist!</p><p>The only comfort was that the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers that blocked his path were gone.  And before his departure, as a token of his affection, he had given Liu Li the Superior Soul-Soothing Incense and the Heavenly Exquisite Jade's spirit embryo…</p><p>He could only hope that she would break through on her own and that they would meet again in the Grand Thousand World!</p><p>"Within the River of Misfortune, there's always been a mysterious expert ferrying a boat. Cultivators ascending from Minor Thousand Worlds, if unfortunately swept into the River of Misfortune, will be ushered into the Grand Thousand World…"</p><p>As she spoke, the First Sword Attendant's figure grew increasingly faint.</p><p>She didn't say more, believing that Qin Sang, having reached this stage, understood the stakes and needed no further reminders.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang still had many questions.</p><p>As the First Sword Attendant's form rapidly faded, just before vanishing, she remembered something, hesitatingly saying, "Be… careful… cultivating… demonic… techniques… in the future…"</p><p>Her voice ethereal, her figure gone.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Was the technique she spoke of the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*?</p><p>Could this technique be entangled in some grand karmic consequence?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but complain inwardly.</p><p>Judging by the First Sword Attendant's tone and expression, she probably meant something else, likely an inherent problem with the technique itself.</p><p>Cultivating demonic techniques with a human body, Qin Sang had long anticipated hidden dangers.</p><p>However, since the First Sword Attendant only cautioned him to be careful and didn't tell him to stop cultivating it altogether, did it mean the problem wasn't extremely serious, or that she herself wasn't certain?</p><p>…</p><p>"I have a body!"</p><p>"I have a body!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts were interrupted by the Vermillion Bird's joyful cries.</p><p>With the First Sword Attendant gone, the Vermillion Bird became boisterous again, flying in front of Qin Sang, raising its pair of short wings, spinning incessantly, showing off its round, fluffy belly.</p><p>Legend had it that the phoenix dance was breathtakingly beautiful. Unfortunately, the Vermillion Bird's nascent spirit hadn't yet adapted to its new body; its movements were stiff, devoid of any grace.</p><p>It had once sworn to avenge itself upon the one who pinched its neck, but it seemed to have completely forgotten.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, reminding it, "The Heavenly Phoenix True Feather was used to shape your spirit. As for the Phoenix True Fire, even half of it is gone. I also lost the Sun God Tree, a supreme treasure. Have you figured out how you'll compensate me?"</p><p>The Vermillion Bird was about to bristle, but its eyes darted around, and it raised its neck, adopting a haughty air, declaring self-righteously, "This Vermillion Bird was forced! Do you dare to confront the true culprit…"</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A bolt of lightning out of a clear sky.</p><p>Blood-red thunder appeared in the heavens, radiating a tyrannical aura.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird trembled, tucked its neck in, and *whoosh*, dove into Qin Sang's sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head helplessly, glanced at the now powerless Sun God Tree, and stored it away. He looked up at the blood-red thunder in the sky, his expression grave.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The blood thunder was like blood-colored pythons, tearing through the void.</p><p>*Crackle!*</p><p>Suddenly, an incredibly thick bolt of blood-red lightning erupted, traversing the sky as if piercing through the realm, splitting the heavens open.</p><p>This bolt of lightning lingered, then split into countless crimson lightning bolts, their eerie blood-red light illuminating the world.</p><p>The sky seemed to truly crack open, as a river of blood poured in.</p><p>Following the moon, thunder, golden sun, and starry sea, this realm welcomed a new celestial phenomenon.</p><p>To the beings of this realm, this blood-red thunder was more terrifying than any before.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Suddenly, torrential rain began to fall, the raindrops crimson.</p><p>The four governed regions were located directly beneath the river of blood, bearing the brunt of the downpour, but the blood rain was rapidly spreading, engulfing the entire realm!</p><p>The rain seemed real, yet it left no trace upon the ground.</p><p>However, all living beings could sense the intense aura of death and tyranny, instinctively filled with boundless fear, driving them to seek shelter from the blood rain.</p><p>The drumming stopped, but ferocious beasts still lingered at the edges of the Plains of Misfortune and the Sea of Misfortune. Sensing the aura of the blood rain, they fled in panic.</p><p>"The First Sword Attendant claimed to be delivering a Grand Completion stage cultivator's dao field. Could this be the celestial phenomenon of a Grand Completion stage expert's fall?"</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly shocked. "They actually killed a Grand Completion stage expert!"</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A sword ray suddenly parted the blood rain, piercing through the void, and landed before Qin Sang.</p><p>The sword trembled slightly, revealing a boy in azure robes.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang, the boy in azure robes smiled gently. "Qin Sang, I'm very familiar with you. Unfortunately, due to a twist of fate, you don't recognize me yet… My master personally named me Earth Slaughter, but later, people mostly called me the Purple Star Child."</p><p>"Qin Sang greets Senior Earth Slaughter."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed respectfully.</p><p>Perhaps due to his time with the Earth Slaughter Sword, Qin Sang didn't feel as constrained facing the boy in azure robes as he did with the First Sword Attendant.</p><p>The boy in azure robes spoke softly, "There's no need for such formality between us. Since you've received my master's inheritance, you're also my junior. I hope to see, and will help you, uphold my master's will, overcome all difficulties, ascend to the peak of the Grand Thousand World, and achieve immortality! Moreover, I need your help to find the other fragments of my sword body…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Earth Slaughter Sword's main body. "Senior, are you referring to the hilt?"</p><p>The boy in azure robes nodded. "The hilt should also have been placed within a Sword Pavilion by my master. The Sword Pavilion was summoned back to the Grand Thousand World by those people, but I don't know if it's been retrieved… Unfortunately, the power I've recovered is depleted. I need to continue slumbering and can't help you much."</p><p>Pausing, the boy in azure robes looked towards Qin Sang's brow. "Summon your natal spirit sword."</p><p>Qin Sang complied, summoning the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword landed in the boy in azure robes' hand, its sharpness completely concealed, lying quietly in his palm.</p><p>The boy in azure robes gently stroked the sword, a look of reminiscence flashing in his eyes. He hesitated for a moment, then softly asked, "Will you keep it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, realizing that the boy in azure robes was referring to the sword spirit.</p><p>When a spirit treasure's spirit embryo gave birth to a sword spirit, it faced two choices.</p><p>One was to refine the sword spirit into the sword body, achieving true treasure status.</p><p>The other was to birth the sword spirit, becoming a  post-heaven spirit treasure.</p><p>As far as he knew, the vast majority of sword cultivators chose the former, embracing the path of the sword, better able to temper their sword heart!</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>Qin Sang answered without hesitation.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword held the hope of Cloud Wanderer's revival; how could he abandon it?</p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p>The boy in azure robes repeated the word "good" three times. He raised a finger and pointed it at the sword body, a speck of azure light shooting out from his fingertip.</p><p>The azure light flowed like water, spreading across the sword body, slowly seeping into it.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was both surprised and delighted.</p><p>He had originally wanted to ask the First Sword Attendant if she could help Cloud Wanderer be reborn, but she had left too quickly. The boy in azure robes was also a powerful being, and a sword spirit at that. He should also possess such abilities.</p><p>He hurriedly explained the whole story.</p><p>"It's fine. What I'm doing is helping it transform sooner. It won't harm the spirit embryo in the slightest, nor will it have any adverse effects on your friend's true spirit. However…"</p><p>The boy in azure robes pondered for a while, then continued, "No one knows whether the sword spirit born from this sliver of true spirit will truly be your friend, whether it will recover its past memories…"</p><p>His tone wasn't optimistic.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, lost in thought.</p><p>Perhaps no one in the world understood sword spirits better than the boy in azure robes. His judgment could almost be considered truth.</p><p>"If the transformed sword spirit has no memories of the past, would it be considered a new life? Is that the outcome Cloud Wanderer Senior would want?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were filled with worry and unwillingness.</p><p>He yearned for the day he could share a drink and converse with Cloud Wanderer Senior again.</p><p>Could it be that there truly was no method of revival in this world?</p><p>He could only hope that the boy in azure robes' judgment was wrong, Qin Sang thought as he gazed at the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>As the azure light continuously flowed from the boy in azure robes' fingertip, merging into the sword body, the Cloud Wanderer Sword's body appeared increasingly clear, like the purest substance in the world.</p><p>The sword light trembled gently, as if within the sword body, a beating spirit embryo was gradually growing and strengthening under the nourishment of the azure light.</p><p>Finally, the azure light gradually faded.</p><p>The boy in azure robes withdrew his finger, returning the Cloud Wanderer Sword to Qin Sang, his face filled with exhaustion. "Before the spirit embryo absorbs this power, don't use the sword lightly."</p><p>At this moment, although the Cloud Wanderer Sword hadn't turned into a sword embryo, its body felt light as water.</p><p>"Thank you for your assistance, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in gratitude, firmly memorizing his words.</p><p>In fact, after learning the origins of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, Qin Sang had resolved never to use the Cloud Wanderer Sword in front of others again!</p><p>"You seem to have the aura of another sword spirit on you."</p><p>The boy in azure robes said again.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He took out the Five Elements Crown. "Senior, are you referring to this?"</p><p>The boy in azure robes nodded, beckoning it closer, and scrutinizing it for a moment.  Noticing the Five Elements Crown's unconventional nature, he couldn't help but let out a soft gasp.</p><p>"Interesting… It has formed a spirit body before experiencing the Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>He raised a hand, making a grabbing motion towards the Five Elements Crown.  The Five Elements Crown flashed with five-colored light, and a surge of black demonic qi erupted from within.</p><p>The demonic qi churned restlessly.</p><p>The boy in azure robes pondered for a moment, then directly reached into the demonic qi.</p><p>The next moment, the demonic qi rapidly converged, and the silhouette of a figure gradually appeared within.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze and saw a little girl, seemingly six or seven years old, who resembled the female cultivator possessed by the demonic spirit back then. Her eyes were closed, and she was sound asleep.</p><p>The boy in azure robes held the little girl aloft, the swirling demonic qi merging into her body, making her form clearer and more substantial.</p><p>"Is this the Five Elements Crown's sword spirit?"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the demonic aura lingered on her, though it was significantly suppressed compared to before.</p><p>"She's just a step away from transformation, but she's trapped by demonic qi. I've helped her suppress it. In the future, find a way to erode the demonic aura from her, and she'll be able to undergo the tribulation and transform into a true post-heaven spirit treasure!"</p><p>Having done this, the boy in azure robes' aura weakened further. "After entering the Grand Thousand World, don't forget this matter. If I can restore my original body, my recovery will be much faster.  Back then, my master inscribed the sword scripture onto fragments and sent them away along with the Sword Pavilion. Only by finding the hilt can you obtain the latter part of the sword scripture."</p><p>Sword scripture!</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. "Senior, are you unaware of the cultivation methods beyond the Body Integration stage?"</p><p>He had assumed that with the Sword Spirit's revival, he would receive the subsequent cultivation methods.</p><p>The boy in azure robes shook his head.</p><p>"My master didn't name this sword scripture back then, because he felt it wasn't perfect yet. The sword scripture you're currently cultivating is vastly different from what I remember. It should have incorporated my master's final insights.</p><p>I remember the original sword scripture. When you break through to Body Integration, if you haven't found it by then, I should have recovered somewhat and can help you deduce it.</p><p>Your cultivation is still low.  Teaching you now would only disrupt your path.</p><p>However, the comprehension of the Killing Dao is certainly interconnected. At the Nascent Soul stage, you should have some understanding. Do you know what my master did during the Void Refinement stage?"</p><p>Qin Sang listened attentively as the boy in azure robes said in a deep voice, "Slay those who deserve to be slain!"</p><p>This answer surprised Qin Sang greatly.</p><p>Who deserved to be slain? How was that judgment made?</p><p>"What about the Body Integration stage?" Qin Sang quickly asked.</p><p>"Slay the self!"</p><p>The boy in azure robes' answer was once again unexpected.</p><p>He was concise with his words, only guiding Qin Sang in the right direction, offering no explanations, leaving him to comprehend on his own, for anything else would diminish its beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to ask more, but seeing that the boy in azure robes was unwilling to elaborate, his form flickered as he prepared to return to his main body to slumber.  Qin Sang hurriedly asked his final question.</p><p>"Within the sword scripture, is there a secret refining technique?"</p><p>Without the Jade Buddha, he wouldn't have been able to cultivate the sword scripture at all.</p><p>The consequences of forcibly cultivating the sword scripture without a corresponding secret technique were clearly demonstrated by Senior Qing Zhu.</p><p>Moreover, the Thunder Ancestor's power had pushed the Jade Buddha to its limits.</p><p>Qin Sang realized he couldn't always rely on the Jade Buddha and needed to plan for the future.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the boy in azure robes revealed a look of reverence and pride.</p><p>"My master cultivated the Killing Dao, walked the path of corpses, and trod the sea of blood. What need did he have for secret techniques!"</p><p>As he vanished, the boy in azure robes gave Qin Sang a deep look.</p><p>This was precisely why they held Qin Sang in such high regard.</p><p>In this mortal world, how many possessed such a heart and will, capable of fully cultivating this sword scripture?</p><p>He could only hope that Qin Sang would live up to their expectations!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
