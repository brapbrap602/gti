<h1>Chapter 910: Two Years</h1><p>Soon, the other Eagle King was also slain.</p><p>Leaderless, the Rotwing Eagles panicked and fled Poison Island.</p><p>Qin Sang only eliminated the greater demons at the Demon Spirit stage and above. He didn't pursue the lesser demons, instead trapping them with the intention of confining them to a few mountain peaks, creating an illusion that nothing had changed on the island.</p><p>Afterward, he located the island's spirit veins and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>"Not bad! The two Eagle Kings' nests are located at the best spot on the spirit veins, perfect for a cave dwelling.  But the stench in here is unbearable..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, casting spells to cleanse the foul odor. After some thought, he walked the entire island, releasing the Rotwing Eagles, and deployed a purchased illusion formation and a spirit formation to withstand storms.</p><p>The illusion formation, combined with the poisonous miasma, formed the first line of defense.</p><p>Returning to the cave, he set up multiple layers of restrictions and spirit formations.</p><p>After all, if all went well, he would cultivate here for several decades. He couldn't be too careful.</p><p>"Perfect!"</p><p>Qin Sang took out a meditation mat, sat down, and a satisfied expression appeared on his face.</p><p>After resting for a while and washing away his fatigue, Qin Sang finally had time to carefully consider his next steps.</p><p>"First, I need to push my avatar to the Core Formation stage, then it can assist me with Stellar Essence Infusion.</p><p>"My avatar has reached the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.  Now I can start preparing to refine the Corpse Pill using the 'Seed Demon Fetus' technique. I've been comprehending these two cultivation methods for so long, and I'm about sixty percent confident in refining the Corpse Pill. Once my avatar reaches the Pseudo Core Formation stage, I'll gain further insights and improve the technique. Success is almost guaranteed.</p><p>"By then, 'Demonic Refinement' should have also reached the peak of the second level. After everything is ready, it's time for dedicated cultivation. In my spare time, I'll study refining tools. Nothing much else..."</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the two spirit insects on his shoulder.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was staring at him expectantly, waiting to be fed.</p><p>After feeding the Fat Silkworm Purple Crystals, Qin Sang released the Skyeye Butterfly, letting it roam freely within the cave. He thought to himself,</p><p>"I wonder if they can break through to the mid-stage of the third transformation before the Seven Killing Palace opens. After advancing, their supernatural powers will greatly increase, and they can be of more help to me.</p><p>"And the Two-Headed Hound... With its temperament, it seems unlikely to submit. In that case, I won't force it. As long as it can break through to the late stage on its own, or if I find a more suitable spirit beast, I'll set it free.</p><p>"With the Star Platform, I don't need spirit herbs to break through to the third level of body refinement. I'll leave the Tyrant Blood Fruit for it. It has helped me a lot, consider it a reward..."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He released his avatar, fed it with blood, and let it cultivate on its own.  Then, he took out the jade slip containing the 'Lightning Manipulation Technique'.</p><p>He had studied the 'Lightning Manipulation Technique' countless times, but hadn't found a safe place to practice it until now.</p><p>"Refine Stellar Sha, command Heavenly Lightning, evolve the strongest lightning technique... Such bold claims..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>The power of 'Lightning Manipulation Technique' was indeed strong, but as his cultivation improved, whether it truly lived up to its description as the strongest lightning technique remained to be seen.</p><p>"To cultivate this technique, one must first refine Stellar Sha, then draw down Heavenly Lightning until the technique is mastered. The Split Wind Islands frequently experience storms, so there will be no shortage of thunderstorms. However, drawing Heavenly Lightning into the body is extremely dangerous.  Lán Dòu Sect disciples must have had Nascent Soul protectors when they cultivated this. I can only rely on myself..."</p><p>Qin Sang finished reading the cultivation process and couldn't help but feel his scalp tingle.</p><p>The power of the technique was truly formidable, making the risk worthwhile.</p><p>The power of the 'Lightning Manipulation Technique' depends on the cultivator's level of cultivation. The higher the cultivation, the greater the power.</p><p>However, it was important to note that because both forces were extremely violent, the moment the 'Lightning Manipulation Technique' was used, it would not only damage the user but also drain seventy to eighty percent of their True Essence, which was why it could unleash such terrifying power.</p><p>"No wonder the Dòu Niú Peak disciples were so soundly defeated, with some even captured alive. This technique can only be used when one can kill the opponent with a single blow, or as a last resort in a desperate situation..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious, reminding himself to be cautious in the future.</p><p>However, since he also cultivated his body, after breaking through to the third level of 'Demonic Refinement', his physical body would far surpass that of other cultivators, and he should be able to withstand the backlash of the 'Lightning Manipulation Technique'.</p><p>At night, Qin Sang cultivated 'Demonic Refinement', accumulating enough Stellar Sha in his body, and immediately began cultivating the 'Lightning Manipulation Technique', refining the Stellar Sha.</p><p>Unknowingly, a month passed in a flash.</p><p>None of the nearby cultivators noticed that the dreaded Poison Island had changed hands. Qin Sang cultivated steadily, enjoying the rare peace and quiet.</p><p>Finally, the first storm since he occupied Poison Island arrived.</p><p>The midday sun was suddenly obscured by dark clouds.</p><p>In an instant, darkness descended, accompanied by howling winds and towering waves.</p><p>The spirit formations steadily protected Poison Island.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the mountaintop, watching the apocalyptic scene around him. Finally, he looked up at the sky, where dark clouds gathered and lightning snaked. He was about to rush up there to draw down Heavenly Lightning.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he felt a little apprehensive.  He steadied himself and waited until the storm was nearing its end, when the lightning wasn't as terrifying, before he formed hand seals and soared into the sky.</p><p>A clap of thunder!</p><p>Lightning pierced the darkness, striking a human figure.</p><p>Qin Sang grunted and plummeted into the sea. The Two-Headed Hound, waiting below, caught him and carried him back to Poison Island.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound wrinkled its nose at the smell of burnt flesh, its face full of disgust.</p><p>Qin Sang's body trembled slightly. He forced himself to sit up and immediately resumed his cultivation.</p><p>With his cultivation level, resisting that lightning bolt wasn't difficult, but in order to cultivate this technique, he had to lower most of his defenses and focus all his energy on completing the hand seals to draw Heavenly Lightning into his body.</p><p>Pain was a minor matter.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. Sitting on the mountaintop, he focused his mind, urging the power of Stellar Sha to subdue the rampaging lightning power.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound stood guard beside him.</p><p>It tilted its head, watching Qin Sang's focused expression, seemingly understanding something. Finally, it retracted its gaze, lay down, and appeared lost in thought.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly soared into the sky, actively drawing down Heavenly Lightning until the storm subsided.</p><p>In the end, his robes were torn to shreds, and lightning-shaped scars marked his body.</p><p>Ignoring his disheveled appearance, Qin Sang made hand seals, sensing the day's gains. "Not bad, my understanding of the 'Lightning Manipulation Technique' is correct! After experiencing a few more storms, this technique will be considered mastered..."</p><p>A satisfied expression appeared on his face as he returned to his cave.</p><p>Unknowingly, two more years passed.</p><p>Poison Island remained peaceful, undisturbed.</p><p>One night, Qin Sang was cultivating when he suddenly opened his eyes, a hint of joy flashing within them. He murmured, "Finally, it's done!"</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Sang vanished, appearing deep within the cave. He looked at his avatar, now at the Pseudo Core Formation stage, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p>
