<h1>Chapter 1827: The Dharma Aspect</h1><p>The Azure Bird Dharma Aspect appeared!</p><p>As the crescent moon blades approached, Qin Sang's expression remained calm and unwavering.  The azure light of his Dharma Aspect poured down from his crown, flooding his body.</p><p>Azure light filled the air.</p><p>A phoenix cry seemed to echo from within Qin Sang.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The phoenix wings behind him suddenly unfurled, stretching wide.  Electric arcs leaped between each feather, shimmering with an otherworldly radiance, displaying exquisite beauty.</p><p>The beauty of the wings was breathtaking.</p><p>Unfortunately, only Xia Hou could appreciate it.  Before this, Mo Xingdao's five senses had been sealed by Qin Sang and he was safely tucked away in his Dantian. Otherwise, given Mo Xingdao's strength, he would have undoubtedly perished from the aftershocks.</p><p>Besides, Qin Sang didn't want Mo Xingdao to know too many of his secrets.</p><p>Compared to the phoenix wings, Qin Sang's physical form looked oddly mismatched.</p><p>However, a faint ethereal image flickered around him – the Azure Bird, merging with his physical body.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Azure flames seemed to erupt from Qin Sang, his power surging.</p><p>Accompanied by a deafening roar, the rapidly spinning vortex of wind faltered, then was ripped apart by a dense mass of azure light.</p><p>The azure light was blinding, like a thunderbolt.  A vague figure could be seen within the light.  The phoenix wings flapped once, violently breaking free from the constraints, transforming into a flash of lightning and retreating rapidly.</p><p>The five crescent moon blades arrived as predicted, only to find their target gone.</p><p>Xia Hou's eyes widened in shock, then hardened into a fierce expression. His antlers vibrated, the crescent moon blades becoming three times brighter, seemingly burning with all their power in an instant. A piercing shriek tore through the air, ripping through the void.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's eyes reflected five silver beams, and his body felt a tingling sensation of being torn apart.</p><p>If he failed to react properly, the crescent moon blades would have dismembered him.</p><p>Just then, the phoenix wings fluttered gently, and Qin Sang subtly twisted his body at the critical moment.</p><p>To the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's perception, though the five crescent moon blades were incredibly sharp, Xia Hou's desperate attack, caused by Qin Sang's unexpected escape, wasn't perfectly executed.  There were minute gaps between them.</p><p>These gaps were imperceptible to ordinary people, or even if perceived, they would lack the ability to exploit them.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, possessed that ability.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The first crescent moon blade grazed Qin Sang's chest.</p><p>Then the second, almost decapitating him, but he dodged it.</p><p>The two crescent moon blades passed Qin Sang, exploding into two blinding silver lights in the void.</p><p>Simultaneously, silver light erupted in front of Qin Sang, even near his chest.</p><p>The third crescent moon blade struck his chest, but it failed to pierce even his Wind-Returning Armor, let alone injure Qin Sang.</p><p>This strike was blocked by a fragment of a true treasure!</p><p>When the fourth and fifth blades arrived, they were met with Qin Sang's powerful fists.</p><p>The force behind these punches was far greater than any before.</p><p>After breaking through the mid-stage of the fifth layer of the *Sky Demon Refining Form*, the Dharma Aspect shadow, which had appeared since the fourth layer, had undergone repeated transformations, finally displaying the power befitting a Dharma Aspect, which Qin Sang now borrowed.</p><p>He only borrowed its power because he couldn't fully control the Azure Bird Dharma Aspect; he could only merge it with himself.</p><p>This fusion alone brought about a transformation!</p><p>He unleashed his fists, the azure light on his knuckles like the claws of a true Azure Bird, fused with his fists as he executed Buddhist seals.</p><p>The power of the seals suddenly erupted.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The two crescent moon blades faltered, then exploded before his fists, scattering light like fragments.  The astonishing aftershocks swept outward.</p><p>The five silver lights merged into a single, sun-like glare, engulfing Qin Sang.</p><p>Then, a thunderclap echoed from within the silver light. Qin Sang flew back, his aura still formidable, seemingly unscathed.</p><p>The five blades were dealt with individually. Xia Hou's carefully planned strike was thus neutralized.</p><p>Xia Hou's face was etched with deep shock, not just because Qin Sang had blocked the fatal blow, but because of the Azure Bird phantom.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Xia Hou's heart was shaken. He suddenly met Qin Sang's piercing gaze and then his vision blurred as a powerful aura washed over him.</p><p>In that instant, Xia Hou felt a strange sensation, as if facing a real Azure-plumed Bird, a powerful pressure weighing on his spirit, recalling his vulnerable past as a mere deer facing predators before achieving enlightenment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang fought with all his might, his killing intent unrestrained yet subtly planned.</p><p>Before attacking Xia Hou, a jade bottle appeared silently in Qin Sang's palm, dissolving into dust, releasing shimmering dewdrops that vanished into the air.</p><p>This was a drop of flower-petal poison, an invisible toxin refined using the secret techniques from the "Poison God Canon".  Qin Sang had crushed three such bottles, originally intended for Hong Yuzi.</p><p>Qin Sang highly valued this Daoist official. The Vajra Wheel Seal, the Azure-plumed Bird form, and the poison were his trump cards, meant to rescue Mo Xing Dao, but now used against Xia Hou.</p><p>He'd set up supporting formations for the poison in his ambush location, meticulously planning his attack.  The palace offered an advantage: the inward pull of energy prevented the poison from dispersing.</p><p>The poison was invisible, difficult to detect unless Qin Sang activated its power with his inner strength. Of course, the current amount was insufficient to threaten a late-stage Nascent Divinity cultivator.</p><p>He was waiting.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang dashed towards Xia Hou, launching a counterattack.</p><p>For a moment, Xia Hou hesitated to engage directly, spitting out a jet of black energy, quickly summoning his antlers. The antlers spun, condensing and releasing the energy into a black torrent.</p><p>Qin Sang revealed himself, striking the torrent with a punch. A deafening roar shook the palace, sending both combatants reeling.</p><p>Xia Hou retreated, intently watching Qin Sang. His earlier uncertainty vanished; the Azure-plumed Bird phantom was the opponent's manifestation!</p><p>A Manifestation!</p><p>The power of a demon king. Even late-stage Cave Profound demon lords could achieve it, either through exceptional bloodline, innate talent awakening ancestral bloodline, or extraordinary comprehension.</p><p>Though Xia Hou hadn't fought them, he'd heard of their strength.</p><p>These demon lords were extremely rare, honored guests of the demon kings, holding esteemed positions.  Legend had it that some were even permitted to train at the Grand Sage's Palace.</p><p>If the top demon lord under the Tianqiu King had achieved a manifestation, Xia Hou wouldn't dare challenge his position.</p><p>His own proud Deer Shadow wasn't a true manifestation.  Achieving one signified a complete transformation.</p><p>It allowed him to suppress weaker opponents using the power of heaven and earth, but he was now suppressed by someone who had mastered a manifestation.</p><p>Xia Hou felt that pressure from Qin Sang. Since breaking through to late-stage Cave Profound, he was used to suppressing others, almost forgetting what it felt like to be suppressed.</p><p>Now, a lower-ranked opponent was dredging up those unpleasant memories.</p><p>A mid-stage Cave Profound cultivator manifesting a form—unheard of!</p><p>For the first time, Xia Hou felt genuine unease.</p><p>Qin Sang gave him no time to think, attacking again.  He sensed Xia Hou's hesitation, his eyes burning brighter.</p><p>At the early stage of the fifth layer of the "Celestial Demon Refining Form", his manifestation could easily withstand the pressure of a Separated Marquis. Qin Sang eagerly anticipated what this new transformation would bring.</p><p>The Azure-plumed Bird manifestation did not disappoint; facing Xia Hou, his confidence soared.</p><p>Qin Sang was upon him instantly.  The shock in Xia Hou's eyes hadn't faded when it was replaced by deep apprehension.</p><p>His antlers flew back, circling, merging and separating, becoming one with his body.</p><p>Simultaneously, shadows flickered behind Xia Hou, forming a deer silhouette to help resist the celestial pressure.</p><p>Xia Hou's eyes hardened; he didn't believe a mid-stage Cave Profound manifestation could be sustained.</p><p>Yet only Xia Hou knew his inner turmoil. This was his first encounter with a manifestation-wielder; the situation was beyond his control.</p><p>In a flash, the demon and human clashed again.</p><p>The scene repeated, a brutal hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>But this time, the power and aftershocks were far greater, the battle far more chaotic.</p><p>Their collision was like mountains collapsing, terrifying in its power.</p><p>The battlefield resembled a hurricane, their forms blurred, inseparable.</p><p>Suddenly, a furious roar erupted.</p><p>"You're mad!"</p><p>The voice was Xia Hou's, his final words distorted, like a cry of pain.</p><p>Simultaneously came Qin Sang's muffled groan.</p><p>The clash of battle abruptly ceased.  Both the man and the creature froze, a brief pause in their struggle.  They were face to face, incredibly close. Xia Hou's antlers pressed against Qin Sang's abdomen, while Qin Sang's fist, embedded with spiked knuckles, was buried in Xia Hou's chest.</p><p>The air reeked of blood.  Crimson flowed down the spikes of the knuckles.  Similarly, all five points of the antlers were embedded in Qin Sang, the central one stopped by a fragment of a treasure, protecting a vital area, while the other four were stained red with blood.  Four holes ripped through the Hui Feng armor.</p><p>Even the Diamond Glass Body and the Separable Divine Light couldn't prevent injury.  The brutal force surged into his body, causing widespread damage, but it was quickly suppressed.  Qin Sang didn't even glance at his wounds; his bloodshot eyes were fixed on Xia Hou, an almost manic excitement in their depths.</p><p>The intense pain assaulted Xia Hou's mind.  Meeting Qin Sang's gaze, Xia Hou's expression shifted; it sensed Qin Sang's killing intent and unwavering resolve.  Qin Sang had willingly risked mutual destruction to create this situation, and Xia Hou had no doubt the monster would do it again.</p><p>In that moment, Xia Hou genuinely felt a desire to retreat.  This battle revealed no sign of Qin Sang weakening; his power showed no decline, while Xia Hou himself harbored concerns. His innate ability allowed for instant recovery of strength, but injuries could only be suppressed, not healed.  His two forms shared one body. If one form was injured again, accumulating damage to a certain point would trigger old wounds, causing a sudden, drastic decline.</p><p>Xia Hou wondered if Qin Sang had seen through his weakness, or had some other advantage. This reckless, injury-for-injury tactic was its greatest fear.  Xia Hou glanced at the Wu Xing Mian (Five Elements Crown).  It loved treasures, but valued its life more.</p><p>'Rip!'</p><p>Another clash.  A tearing sound came from Qin Sang's side as a sharp antler ripped through his Hui Feng armor, spraying blood.  His fist, however, landed squarely on Xia Hou's shoulder, nearly shattering its spine.</p><p>Xia Hou was certain; Qin Sang wasn't bluffing. He was a madman. Didn't he worry that even if he died, his desperate gamble would take Xia Hou with him?  Xia Hou couldn't understand. It wanted no more of this; it had already unleashed its killing blow.</p><p>Xia Hou stared deeply at Qin Sang, letting out a cold snort filled with anger. It had used its serious injury as bait to lure the Azure Fox, only to have its efforts stolen.</p><p>Then, Xia Hou summoned a black demonic wind, turning to flee towards the palace gates.  Unexpectedly, a bolt of lightning, faster still, intercepted it, then spun to attack.  The force of the punch cast a huge shadow over Xia Hou, stinging its eyes.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Xia Hou hastily parried, staggering back several meters, glaring at Qin Sang. It had conceded defeat, abandoning the treasure; yet this man still wouldn't let it go.</p><p>An incredible thought struck Xia Hou: "This monster... does it want to kill me? How dare it!"</p><p>Qin Sang licked his lips, his eyes shining bright as stars. He had a feeling that killing Xia Hou would be equivalent to slaying ten ferocious beasts, freeing him from the need to relentlessly pursue enlightenment for a long time to come. If not for the Azure Fox Saint King forcing Xia Hou to reveal its innate ability, Qin Sang would never have conceived such a reckless plan.</p><p>"You're asking for death!"</p><p>Xia Hou roared in fury.  The other party was determined to fight to the death; it couldn't escape. Not only was its escape technique inferior, but it would also face two black dragons upon exiting the palace.</p><p>The image of a deer transformed into a black ray, its antlers spinning rapidly, poised to strike.</p><p>Just then, a deafening thunderclap shook the palace.  Unlike the Azure Bird's thunder, this bolt of lightning, carrying the might of a tribulation thunder, brewed from nothingness and struck toward Xia Hou.</p><p>Xia Hou's fur stood on end.</p><p>The aura of a tribulation thunder!  This aura terrified cultivators, both human and demon alike.</p><p>Xia Hou, with his cultivation, wouldn’t be frightened by a single tribulation thunder, but the shock to his mind was unavoidable.  Anyone facing a sudden tribulation thunder would hesitate, assess the situation, and identify the source before acting;  no one would be completely unprepared.</p><p>Xia Hou decisively stopped his technique, retreating rapidly, his spiritual sense locking onto the tribulation thunder.  Only after confirming it was a single, limited-power bolt—apparently a disguised attack—did he relax.</p><p>This fleeting moment of hesitation was the opportunity Qin Sang had been waiting for.  He didn't hesitate, pushing his lightning escape technique to the limit, charging into Xia Hou!</p><p>As Xia Hou retreated, it suddenly felt its body tighten.  Qin Sang closed in, his hands like iron clamps gripping it tightly, using his body as a weapon to ram into it—thus exposing his own back to Xia Hou!</p><p>Another injury-for-injury exchange.</p><p>Xia Hou now understood; the tribulation thunder was a bluff, and ignored it, immediately thrusting its antlers.</p><p>However, while it was indeed an exchange of injuries, it was different this time.  A small fire tree suddenly appeared on Qin Sang’s chest, with nine firebirds perched on its branches.</p><p>The nine firebirds took flight simultaneously, merging with each other the moment they left the tree.</p><p>This strike was guided by the Vermilion Bird spirit, but the true energy consumed came from Qin Sang.  Although weak, the Vermilion Bird spirit could still summon the Sun Birds; it didn't need to control them for long.</p><p>Because the Sun Birds were gathering fire on Qin Sang's chest before exploding between the man and the deer.</p><p>"Never seen anyone so eager to die!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's muttering reached Qin Sang's ears, swallowed by the explosion.</p><p>(End)</p>
