<h1>Chapter 826: High-Grade Spirit Stones</h1><p> Alchemist Yi sized up Qin Sang.  Without a spar, he couldn't tell from Qin Sang's appearance whether he had trained his body. He was secretly surprised that Qin Sang not only possessed such high cultivation but was also a dual cultivator of both Dharma and body refinement. Such talent was truly remarkable; he hadn't misjudged him before.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't hide it from Alchemist Yi and nodded. "I wasn't a body refiner before, but my cultivation reached a bottleneck, and I couldn't see any hope of a breakthrough. I had no choice but to seek other methods. Trying the path of body refinement was also a last resort, hoping it could provide some insight and help. Fellow Daoist Yi is indeed a great alchemist, with vast knowledge. You immediately recognized the effects of these spirit herbs."</p><p>"I just happened to see them while researching…" Alchemist Yi simply took out an ancient scroll and handed it to Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist Qin, take a look yourself. Both of these spirit herbs are recorded in this ancient scroll. The Scorpion Venom Grass contains a potent poison, and using such a fierce poison for body refinement is as domineering as the Tyrant Blood Fruit, if not more so. Both are extremely powerful medicines. Without the suppressing power of demonic bloodline, it could lead to crippling injuries or even death from the poison's impact. Even human body refiners cannot take it lightly. You should be very cautious."</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, took the ancient scroll, and carefully examined it. While he was reading, Alchemist Yi continued, "Actually, these two spirit herbs are not entirely demonic fruits. The Azure Root has a milder effect and is also recorded among us humans, known as the Maoshan Vine. It can be used to refine a type of elixir that strengthens bones and increases strength, although it's somewhat less effective. However, the Azure Root's effects are certainly not limited to this, but only demons can fully digest it. We lose a lot of its potency during the refining process."</p><p>The ancient scroll recorded more than just these demonic fruits, and Qin Sang memorized them all before returning the scroll to Alchemist Yi. "Fellow Daoist Yi, have these three spirit herbs ever appeared in the Boundless Sea?"</p><p>Alchemist Yi thought for a moment and said, "In my memory, two hundred years ago, a Maoshan Vine, also known as Azure Root, was indeed auctioned at the auction house. It was said that the seller accidentally discovered it in the Demonic Sea, but it didn't fetch a very high price. As for the buyer, it's impossible to track now. This was the only time. As for the Scorpion Venom Grass, I've never heard of it."</p><p>It seemed that the difficulty of gathering these spirit herbs was no less than finding a location for Star Essence Infusion. Qin Sang's face showed a contemplative expression. He could only ask Alchemist Yi to keep an eye out.</p><p>They chatted for a while longer before Qin Sang got up and excused himself. Afterward, Qin Sang visited the shopkeepers he was familiar with, and unexpectedly, he had a stroke of luck.</p><p>A shopkeeper told him that someone had a piece of High-Grade Fire Spirit Stone, but the exchange requirement was very demanding – a spirit herb capable of purging demonic煞 energy from the Nascent Soul. If the spirit herb was good enough, they were willing to add some low-grade spirit stones.</p><p>High-grade spirit stones were indeed rare, but for most Core Formation cultivators, they weren't essential. Only when establishing a sect with a powerful protective formation would high-grade spirit stones be necessary. There weren't many like Qin Sang who urgently needed them.</p><p>However, this kind of spirit herb that could purge demonic煞 energy was highly effective for most human Core Formation experts who had broken through using demonic煞 pills. Over the years, such spirit herbs had become increasingly scarce, and their prices had soared. That person only had one High-Grade Spirit Stone, and even if they wanted to exchange it for a spirit herb, they would have to wait for the right opportunity.</p><p>Upon hearing this news, Qin Sang remembered that he did have a Golden Orchid Grass.  He obtained this Golden Orchid Grass when he killed Du Han in the western region of the Wu God Continent, and he hadn't had a chance to sell it since. Even when he was short of money, he wouldn't exchange such a treasure for mere currency.</p><p>The worth of this trade depended entirely on his own judgment. Qin Sang urgently needed High-Grade Spirit Stones, and the Golden Orchid Grass itself wasn't exorbitantly valuable, so he immediately agreed to the exchange and asked the shopkeeper to contact the person.</p><p>He sipped tea in the shop and waited for a while. The shopkeeper led a person in.  Qin Sang was speechless when he saw the person. For a single spirit herb, the person was clad in a black robe and a hooded cloak, both treasures that could conceal one's aura. They were even more cautious than he had been back then.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you have the Golden Orchid Grass. Is it a mature spirit herb?" The black-robed person's voice was hoarse, clearly disguised.</p><p>"Indeed!" Qin Sang didn't waste words. He took out a jade box and handed it to the black-robed person.</p><p>The black-robed person carefully inspected it before confirming its authenticity. They cautiously took out a storage pouch and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the High-Grade Spirit Stone. A wave of heat instantly washed over him, and sensing the pure fire spiritual energy, his face lit up with joy. He looked at the black-robed person. "It's indeed a High-Grade Spirit Stone. I wonder if Fellow Daoist has any more spare High-Grade Spirit Stones? Any of the five elements will do. You can set the conditions."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist seems to be in dire need of High-Grade Spirit Stones. Unfortunately, this is the only one I have. Since Fellow Daoist has no objections to this transaction, I'll take my leave." The black-robed person was straightforward, turning to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback. He paid the shopkeeper and also excused himself. By the time he came out, the black-robed person was long gone.</p><p>"I only have three High-Grade Spirit Stones now. Fully refining the Xuan Iron Pillar requires at least four High-Grade Spirit Stones, and I need to reserve two for the ancient teleportation formation, which means I still need to find three more. Fortunately, there's no requirement for the element, otherwise it would be even more troublesome." Qin Sang pondered as he walked.</p><p>Not long after he left, in a secret room within the shop, the black-robed person returned, toying with the Golden Orchid Grass, appearing indifferent to it. The shopkeeper stood before them respectfully.</p><p>"Willing to part with even this kind of herb, this person is indeed desperate for High-Grade Spirit Stones. I just don't know how big their appetite is…" the black-robed person said softly.</p><p>The shopkeeper nodded repeatedly. "It's indeed not easy to find High-Grade Spirit Stones these days. I heard that the Demonic Sea is in turmoil recently. The spirit mines discovered by both races with great difficulty have been seized by the demon race. It's foreseeable that it will be even harder in the future. This person has been searching for them before. They disappeared for a few years, perhaps in seclusion or traveling elsewhere. They still haven't obtained any, suggesting they probably aren't from a major power, most likely a rogue cultivator, which fits Senior Brother's criteria for recruitment."</p><p>"Their cultivation is a bit low, but sufficient as an assistant. It's not bad to be able to enlist them with just a few spirit stones," the black-robed person nodded. "The time isn't ripe yet. Let's keep them as a potential candidate for now. There's no rush to contact them. Continue to keep an eye out for others and invite more late-stage experts to ensure everything goes smoothly. As long as the conditions aren't too unreasonable, we can agree to them. I came here on Master's orders, and Senior Brother will arrive later. There's no need to worry about treasures; we can definitely satisfy them."</p><p>"This…" The shopkeeper's face fell. "There aren't many late-stage experts among rogue cultivators. Many have been recruited by major powers. I can only try my best…"</p><p>While they were discussing in secret, Qin Sang left the marketplace, taking a circuitous route, and arrived at the mortal courtyard he had purchased earlier. He saw a message talisman locked within the restriction. Lady Liu had contacted him while he was away.</p>
