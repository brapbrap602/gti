<h1>Chapter 660: Secrets of the Seven Kills Hall</h1><p>Qin Sang swiftly cast a series of spells, sealing Du Han's cultivation.</p><p>Although he had planned an ambush and meticulously prepared, Qin Sang hadn't expected to capture Du Han so easily.</p><p>After all, Du Han had been a Golden Core cultivator for many years and came from a prominent sect. He was bound to have some tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang's original plan was to kill Du Han and, before his soul dispersed, find an opportunity to search his memories for crucial information.</p><p>Then he would begin his escape.</p><p>Now that he had captured Du Han alive, and didn't have to immediately face the pressure from the Li Wu Palace, he could make arrangements calmly.</p><p>Leaving Du Han aside, Qin Sang started to meticulously clean the battlefield, erasing any trace of the fight. If something couldn't be concealed, he would destroy it.</p><p>While cleaning up, Qin Sang found Du Han's Blackwater Mirror in the forest.</p><p>Of Du Han's two magic treasures, the Bone Claw was destroyed, and the Blackwater Mirror was only damaged.</p><p>Tainted by the Bloodfiend Divine Light, this magic treasure's power was greatly diminished, and it had fallen from the sky.  Being a magic treasure, unlike a regular magical tool, its essence wasn't directly destroyed.</p><p>Later, after erasing all traces of Du Han, Qin Sang could refine the mirror, nurture it within his dantian for a while, and it would fully recover.</p><p>However, as this magic treasure was bestowed upon Du Han by the Li Wu Palace, Qin Sang wasn't sure if they had placed any secret methods within it. So he didn't dare act rashly and stored it in his Qianjun Ring. He would claim it as his own after leaving the Western Frontier, or even the Wu Shen Continent.</p><p>The Blackwater Mirror was quite powerful, among the best of the lower-grade magic treasures.</p><p>Unfortunately, caught off guard by Qin Sang's sudden attack, Du Han couldn't fully utilize its power before being disabled.</p><p>In a fair fight, Qin Sang definitely wouldn't have won so easily.</p><p>Although the Li Wu Palace was involved, the Boundless Sea was vast. Once Qin Sang reached the human territories, he could use it discreetly without too much worry.</p><p>After some time, ensuring everything was secure, Qin Sang took Du Han into a hidden cave deep within the mountains.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Qin Sang threw Du Han onto the ground.</p><p>Du Han awoke, his Golden Core dignity still intact, coldly staring at Qin Sang, "I've roamed the Demon Sea for so many years, never expecting to be taken down by a petty thief on my own doorstep.  Victory goes to the strong, there's nothing more to say. Kill or torture me as you please!"</p><p>After this, Du Han closed his eyes and said no more, seemingly wishing for a quick death.</p><p>If he wouldn't talk, Qin Sang naturally had ways to make him.</p><p>After Soul Searching, Du Han's soul would scatter. Qin Sang didn't want to kill him yet, so he used the Soul Snatching Curse on him.</p><p>The curse's duration on Du Han was much shorter than on Foundation Establishment cultivators. Fortunately, Qin Sang was prepared and quickly asked the most crucial questions; otherwise, he would have been forced to perform a Soul Search.</p><p>As expected, the Li Wu Palace indeed had methods similar to Soul Lamps. If Du Han died, they would instantly know. He would have to wait until he left the Western Frontier and found a safe retreat before taking action.</p><p>The first half of the Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual only contained methods for refining Foundation Establishment cultivators into living corpses. Qin Sang didn't dare use it on Du Han rashly and couldn't store him in the Corpse Puppet Pouch.  He had to retrieve a black coffin from the Qianjun Ring and place Du Han inside, carrying it on his back.</p><p>Qin Sang covered the coffin with layers of restrictive spells to prevent detection, and then disguised it with a ribbon-like magical tool.</p><p>With the coffin on his back, Qin Sang fed the Skyeye Butterfly once, then took out the Fat Silkworm. Finding it hadn't yet formed a cocoon, he put it back in the worm basket.</p><p>He then summoned Ya Gu and checked her condition.</p><p>Without a moment's delay, he left the cave, heading straight towards Thousand Households Village.</p><p>He was about to leave the Western Frontier, but before doing so, he needed to take the old witch doctor from Thousand Households Village with him.</p><p>Too many people in the Xiong Shan region, including those from Thunderclap Village and Hundred Flowers Palace, had seen Qin Sang's face. It was impossible to erase all traces.</p><p>From questioning Du Han, Qin Sang learned that the Li Wu Palace only had one Nascent Soul ancestor, similar in strength to the eight righteous sects of the Small Cold Region. They were the undisputed overlords of the Western Frontier, but in the vast Boundless Sea, especially in the human territories, they were insignificant.</p><p>Qin Sang was ready to leave the Wu Shen Continent and wasn't worried about the Li Wu Palace's threat. Exposing his true appearance didn't matter. He didn't believe they would mobilize for a mere early Golden Core disciple.</p><p>Others had seen him, but once he left the Li Wu Palace's sphere of influence, finding him would be like searching for a needle in the ocean. He had nothing to fear.</p><p>The old witch doctor from Thousand Households Village was different. Apart from Ya Gu, he was the only one who had seen Qin Sang's severed left arm enveloped in corpse Qi!</p><p>This matter was too important for Qin Sang not to be cautious.</p><p>While using the Soul Snatching Curse on Du Han, Qin Sang naturally asked the most pressing questions.</p><p>Only then did he learn that the secrets involved were even more complex and astonishing than he had imagined!</p><p>Flying in mid-air, Qin Sang couldn't help but shiver, feeling as if countless mysteries had suddenly appeared around him, pulling him into a terrifying vortex.</p><p>Speaking of this, he had to mention the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>It turned out that the Seven Kills Hall was a secret realm discovered by human cultivators, located within the storms at the edge of the Boundless Sea!  Traveling from the Wu Shen Continent to the Seven Kills Hall, even with Du Han's Golden Core cultivation, would take more than half a year.</p><p>After the Seven Kills Hall was discovered, some human cultivators ventured inside to explore, and their gains were substantial.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Seven Kills Hall wasn't always open. One couldn't enter and search for treasures every day.</p><p>Only when the Seven Kills Hall appeared could one enter.</p><p>At those times, many human cultivators would brave the storms and enter the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity and hurriedly asked Du Han to recount the previous appearances of the Seven Kills Hall. Shockingly, the intervals between the recent appearances of the Seven Kills Hall coincided precisely with the Purple Subtlety Palace!</p><p>If these were two unrelated secret realms, such a coincidence would be impossible.</p><p>Hearing this, the last shred of hope in Qin Sang's heart vanished. He had likely been transported from the Purple Subtlety Palace to the Seven Kills Hall, and the mysteriously vanished ancient corpse within the Seven Kills Hall was him!</p><p>However, the Seven Kills Hall and the Purple Subtlety Palace weren't entirely the same.</p><p>The Purple Subtlety Palace was hidden deep within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and one could only enter through the formation when the Spirit Tide arrived and the Immortal Palace appeared.</p><p>In the Boundless Sea, after years of exploration, human cultivators discovered that the protective formation around the Seven Kills Hall weakened every few decades.</p><p>By setting up a grand formation outside the Seven Kills Hall during this period, even if the hall itself didn't appear, they could forcefully break through the formation and send people inside.</p><p>At this time, besides those who broke the formation, other cultivators were allowed to enter and search for treasures, but they had to pay a large sum of spirit stones to compensate for the cost of the formation.</p><p>Although it was a secret realm discovered by human cultivators, Wu Clan cultivators could also enter if they were willing to pay enough spirit stones.</p><p>However, there was one requirement: Wu Clan cultivators entering the Seven Kills Hall couldn't have a cultivation level higher than Golden Core.</p>
