<h1>Chapter 839: The Fish Demon</h1><p>The number of demonic beasts was simply overwhelming.</p><p>The golden light array carved a path, but it was immediately closing in.</p><p>From the mountaintop, the leopard demon watching this scene was stunned, feeling intense guilt.  It hadn't expected the golden light array to be so terrifying.  Its insistence on breaking the array to find someone had resulted in severe losses among the demonic beasts. When the transformed demon elites returned, they would undoubtedly be furious and take their anger out on it.</p><p>“Once I succeed, I must hide back in the clan for a few hundred years.”</p><p>The leopard demon made a silent vow.</p><p>The crane demon beside it and a flying fish demon were even more enraged, their hearts bleeding as they watched their subordinates swallowed by the golden light. At the same time, a chilling premonition washed over them, along with relief that they hadn't been at the front.</p><p>“I think I saw Six-Eyes…  He was mangled by the golden light, half his body shattered… I don’t know if he’s dead…”</p><p>The flying fish demon nervously fluttered its long fins, its voice hesitant.</p><p>“The one I saw… I don’t know if it was Redtail’s true form… but he was worse than Six-Eyes.  Completely obliterated by the golden light, no remains left.  The King admired Redtail most… how can I explain this to the King!”</p><p>The crane demon’s voice was sharp, its angry gaze fixed on the leopard demon, wishing to devour it alive.</p><p>“If you didn't want these people, could I have stopped you?  Everything you seize is yours. I don’t mind taking the King's wrath for you, but you must find that person for me!”</p><p>The leopard demon sneered, taking the initiative, leaping down the mountain.</p><p>“What are you two waiting for? The golden light is exhausted. Hurry and find that person.  If you capture him, the Jiao King will be delighted and handsomely reward us. Your King will also benefit and you will certainly not be punished.”</p><p>The crane demon and the flying fish demon exchanged a guilty glance before separately rushing down the mountain in pursuit.</p><p>The leopard demon charged into the demonic horde, sniffing for the cultivator who had broken through.</p><p>After a fruitless search, just as the leopard demon was growing anxious, the crane demon swooped down. “We’ve found traces of that person’s companions to the north.  That group is strong, with many powerful individuals!  The flying fish demon and the others have engaged them.”</p><p>The leopard demon’s eyes lit up. “Is that person among them?”</p><p>“No trace of that person.”</p><p>The crane demon shook its head.</p><p>After a moment’s hesitation, the leopard demon made its decision. “Immediately gather everyone, capture his companions first. Be clever, and don't let the human Yuan Ying cultivator get you!”</p><p>Recalling the human Yuan Ying cultivator, a flicker of fear crossed the crane demon’s eyes.  It reined in its speed and flew off to gather reinforcements.</p><p>The leopard demon immediately darted towards the direction the crane demon had come from.</p><p>At the same time…</p><p>Qin Sang, caught in the beast tide, was facing off against a strange fish demon, his heart filled with growing anxiety.</p><p>This fish demon had a fish head but human-like limbs and walked upright, a slender fishtail trailing behind.  Its eyes were bright and intelligent.</p><p>The moment the array broke, Qin Sang was the first to leave the city, following the golden light to escape.</p><p>With the golden light clearing the way, Qin Sang only needed to flee at full speed. He quickly flew beyond Yu Heng Island, expecting a smooth escape from the beast tide.</p><p>But an unexpected incident occurred.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was fleeing at full speed, he was unknowingly targeted by this fish demon.</p><p>If not for his alertness and the constant vigilance of his Sky-Eyed Butterfly, which detected the fish demon lurking underwater and preparing an ambush, he would likely already be injured.</p><p>What infuriated Qin Sang was that he didn’t pursue the fish demon for its attack, but the fish demon refused to let him go, blocking his path.</p><p>The fish demon stood on the water’s surface, its tail casually splashing water.</p><p>It had a long gash across its body, its left arm and a large patch of flesh from its chest were missing, likely injuries inflicted by the golden light array.</p><p>Despite its severe wounds, the fish demon’s demeanor was incredibly arrogant.</p><p>“Hand over all your treasures to this king, and I'll spare your life!”</p><p>The fish demon's gaze was greedy, fixed on the storage pouch at Qin Sang's waist. It spoke in human language.  It only half-believed the leopard demon’s lies, but it was convinced Qin Sang must have valuable treasures, or the leopard demon wouldn’t be so frantic.</p><p>If he really was a wanted criminal of the Jiao King, his treasures would be even more extraordinary.</p><p>Therefore, upon discovering Qin Sang, it immediately gathered its most capable subordinates, without even thinking of contacting the leopard demon.</p><p>A demon who had consumed Emperor's Flowing Liquid!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank.</p><p>This fish demon's power is likely comparable to that powerful cultivator we encountered outside the Seven Kills Hall.  Even wounded, it's a formidable opponent.</p><p>Even more alarming, several powerful auras are rapidly approaching from a distance – reinforcements summoned by the fish demon.  If surrounded by these powerful demons, escape would be impossible.</p><p>Fortunately, I'm not the same as I was back then.</p><p>There's no time to waste.  Qin Sang, without a word, hurled the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring at the fish demon.</p><p>The fish demon lashed its tail, creating a towering water column to meet the ring, testing its power.  But with a flash of light, a two-headed creature emerged, its vertical pupils unleashing a furious storm that shattered the water column before lunging at the fish demon.</p><p>"With your cultivation, you submit to the humans?  Shameful!"</p><p>The fish demon was stunned, then erupted in fury, cursing the two-headed creature. It then tried bribery,  "Help me kill this person, and I'll request a celebratory reward from the King – the Imperial Dew – to help you achieve your transformation!"</p><p>The two-headed creature thought bitterly, *If this cursed ring weren't on me, I'd have run already. Why endure this suffering?*</p><p>Ignoring the fish demon, Qin Sang arrived on his sword, his hand sweeping out, sending Nine Netherworld Magic Fire as a fiery line towards the fish demon's wound.</p><p>Sensing the magic fire's sinister energy, the fish demon recoiled, desperate to avoid its touch.  Faced with the combined attack of the human and the creature, it felt overwhelmed and sensed danger.</p><p>The fish demon's continued curses and bribes didn't subdue the two-headed creature; instead, they only fueled its rage.</p><p>The situation seemed favorable, but Qin Sang knew this wasn't the time for a prolonged fight.  Those powerful auras were drawing closer.  He needed to act decisively.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang coldly eyed the fish demon, seizing the moment it dodged the magic fire, and unleashed his ultimate trump card: the Star Conch.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A brilliant light erupted, its astonishing power causing the fish demon to recoil in terror.</p><p>"What is that...?"</p><p>The fish demon shrieked in fear.</p><p>The Star Conch hurtled towards it, and the fish demon finally recognized it as the conch-shaped treasure the leopard demon had used. But they hadn't realized its power was this terrifying!</p><p>It had no time for recriminations against the leopard demon now.</p><p>The Star Conch rapidly enlarged before its eyes.  The fish demon's pupils constricted, a vortex opened beneath it, and it dove towards it, its scales flashing blue, like armor.</p><p>The two-headed creature, seizing the opportunity, charged forward to stop the fish demon.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Star Conch struck the fish demon's right chest.</p><p>Its scales were pierced, its entire right side nearly obliterated.  The fish demon's shriek caused the surrounding demonic beasts to instinctively cower.</p>
