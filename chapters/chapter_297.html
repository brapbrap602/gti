<h1>**Chapter 290: Traps**</h1><p>“I didn’t detect any warning signs from my men… Even if we were in danger, I don’t think we’d be trapped here with those old geezers around. Stop being so paranoid. Yu the old ghost has been in there for a while now. We can’t afford to dawdle!”</p><p>Having spoken his mind, Luo Xingnan turned into a beam of escape light and sped away, the others following closely behind.</p><p>Master Shengyuan shook his head helplessly and admitted that Luo Xingnan made some valid points. Nevertheless, he waved his hand to launch a spiritual energy attack at the abyss. The attack cut through the dark energy and caused a stir, but no other changes could be observed.</p><p>Master Shengyuan rushed to catch up upon realizing this.</p><p>They soon flew over the abyss and found it to be calm.</p><p>Master Shengyuan looked away and let down his guard, laughing at himself for his earlier suspicions.</p><p>However, the laughter had barely left his face when he suddenly heard an extremely faint hissing sound.</p><p>“What is that!?”</p><p>Master Shengyuan’s laughter froze, and his face darkened.</p><p>It was not just Master Shengyuan who had heard it, but everyone else. They looked around and found the source of the sound coming from two hills in front of them.</p><p>Not far across from the abyss stood two stone mountains, like sentinels of the wilderness.</p><p>The stone mountains were barren and not particularly short, but compared with the distant mountains that grew spirit herbs, they paled in comparison. They were not eye-catching at all.</p><p>Master Shengyuan and his companions had been so focused on the abyss that they had completely overlooked these mountains. After all, there was nothing to be seen on their bare slopes. With nothing amiss in the abyss, no one had imagined that there could be trouble there.</p><p>The sound came suddenly, like the hiss of some kind of monster.</p><p>The next moment, the ground began to shake violently, and the hissing sound grew louder. It thundered across the plains and quickly rose to a deafening volume.</p><p>Soon after, a cloud of red mist erupted from the top of each mountain, shooting up with a loud whoosh.</p><p>It seemed as if there were giant caves inside the mountains. The red mist appeared without warning and spread out indefinitely, covering half the sky in an instant.</p><p>The two clouds of mist met between the mountains, forming a roadblock.</p><p>“There are snakes inside!” someone yelled, pointing at the mist.</p><p>“Grappling snakes!”</p><p>Finally, everyone saw the tip of the iceberg of the red mist.</p><p>The mist was the breath exhaled by a type of snake-like demonic beast!</p><p>These snakes were exceptionally strange and had the bodies of serpents. Each one was at least several dozen meters long. Unlike true snakes, these grappling snakes had forked tails, and the two resulting snake tails were like iron hooks, gleaming with a dark iron luster.</p><p>Their unique appearance allowed everyone to quickly identify the grappling snakes. At the same time, they recalled the records about them.</p><p>These demonic beasts possessed the power of a Peak Mortal Realm demon at maturity. With cultivation, it was easy for them to break through to the Spirit Demon Realm.</p><p>Their greatest strength was their poison.</p><p>The red mist they exhaled could not only act as a protective shield, absorbing damage, but it also contained deadly venom. Even a cultivator who accidentally inhaled it or had their body exposed to it would be in grave danger.</p><p>The two tail hooks also carried a poison that could kill instantly, and they were incredibly hard. They could even withstand the attack of magic weapons!</p><p>At the moment, the red mist covered the sky, and countless snake figures could be seen writhing within it. It was impossible to tell how many grappling snakes were hiding, but there were at least dozens. Even if only half of them had broken through to the Spirit Demon Realm, it would be a huge problem!</p><p>To make matters worse, there might even be Great Demons of the Mid or Late Spirit Demon Realm among them!</p><p>Luo Xingnan and Master Shengyuan exchanged a glance, both deeply perplexed. Before the grappling snakes appeared, there had been no trace of fighting on or near the mountain. How had Yu Kong avoided the grappling snakes’ senses and passed by them?</p><p>However, that was not the time to consider that.</p><p>“Retreat to the cave!”</p><p>The two did not dare to hesitate. They made a decision and gave the order to retreat.</p><p>The terrain was open here, and if they were surrounded by a swarm of snakes and trapped in the red mist, no one could be sure that they would survive.</p><p>Only by relying on the narrow cave entrance could they calmly set up a formation, divide the swarm, and slowly hunt down the grappling snakes. The grappling snakes were only demonic beasts, after all, and there were so many Foundation Establishment cultivators present that they were not afraid even of such a large number of them.</p><p>The others obeyed the order and quickly retreated into a formation.</p><p>The grappling snakes hissed and roared, and the red mist spread rapidly, pursuing them relentlessly.</p><p>“Be careful not to get injured! Don’t let these brutes smell blood!”</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi suddenly thought of something and yelled out.</p><p>Rumor has it that the Hook Snake is very sensitive to blood, especially that of Human Cultivators, and will become extremely frenzied and go berserk if it smells it, unlike the Hook Snake here.</p><p>Before the sound of his voice faded, they suddenly heard two loud bangs beneath their feet.</p><p>The crowd was shocked and looked down to see two clouds of blood mist explode in the abyss.</p><p>Flesh and bone fragments, mixed with blood, splashed everywhere.</p><p>The crowd was caught off guard and immediately surrounded by the two clouds of blood mist on the left and right.</p><p>“Moon Crescent Immortal!”</p><p>Luo Xingnan’s face changed dramatically, and he cried out in shock.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi’s expression was also extremely horrified, obviously recognizing the withered vine elder.</p><p>At that moment, they suddenly understood something. No wonder there were no secret marks left, and there were no fighting marks.</p><p>Their spy had been exposed long ago, and Yu Kong had known it all along, but turned a blind eye, allowing the spy to pass the message and lure them in.</p><p>This was obviously a trap精心设计的陷阱 designed by Yu Kong!</p><p>Its purpose may have been to use them to attract the Hook Snake, or there may have been a more sinister idea.</p><p>“Quick! Wipe out the blood mist!”</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi was the first to react and shouted, at the same time releasing a fiery red flame to try to burn the blood away. The others naturally did not dare to neglect it, and they all worked to remove the smell of blood.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The red mist followed relentlessly, just behind them. At the moment when the body exploded, the Hook Snake had already smelled the blood.</p><p>In the red mist, where Luo Xingnan and the others could not see, the Hook Snake’s eyes suddenly turned bright red, staring at everyone in the abyss.</p><p>The roaring sound suddenly erupted dozens or hundreds of times.</p><p>Even more alarmingly, deep in the abyss, the dark energy suddenly rolled violently, and two huge snake figures shot out of the abyss with the sound of a roaring roar, like arrows leaving a bowstring, at an alarming speed!</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang and the others, who were hiding in the dark, did not dare to breathe, for fear that the Hook Snake, which was about to go crazy, would smell them and they would suffer the same fate as Luo Xingnan and the others.</p><p>―――――</p><p>Qin Sang quietly looked at Yu Kong’s hiding place. Now that the Hook Snake had been completely attracted by Luo Xingnan and the others, Yu Kong did not take the opportunity to sneak past from the other side to quietly gather herbs.</p><p>Does he want to stay here and watch the battle, waiting for the outcome of this battle before moving?</p><p>Chapter 290: The Trap</p><p>“My men left no warning signs… Even if there were danger, Old Man Yu and his few companions made it through.  Could we really be trapped here? Stop being so paranoid! Old Man Yu has been inside for a while now; we can't afford to dawdle!”</p><p>With that, Luo Xingnan transformed into a streak of light, soaring through the air, followed closely by the others.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi shook his head helplessly. He felt there was some truth in Luo Xingnan’s words, but he still waved his hand, sending a surge of spiritual energy into the abyss. The spiritual energy pierced the Yin energy, causing a disturbance, but nothing else seemed amiss.</p><p>Seeing this, Sheng Yuanzi sped up to catch up.</p><p>The group quickly flew over the abyss.  As expected, there was nothing unusual inside; it remained calm.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi looked away, letting down his guard, and chuckled self-deprecatingly. But before the smile could fade from his face, he suddenly heard a faint hissing sound.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi’s smile froze, his face suddenly darkening.</p><p>Not only Sheng Yuanzi, but others heard it too. They looked around and quickly located the source of the sound—it was coming from the two low hills ahead of them.</p><p>Not far from the other side of the abyss stood two stone hills, like two gatekeepers of the wasteland.</p><p>The stone hills were bare, not particularly small, but compared to the distant mountains covered with spiritual herbs, they were insignificant and inconspicuous.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi and the others had been focused on the abyss. After all, these two hills were completely exposed, and any unusual activity would be easily noticeable. Since there was nothing unusual in the abyss, no one expected the problem to lie with the hills.</p><p>The sound appeared abruptly, like the hiss of some monster.</p><p>The next moment, the ground suddenly trembled. The hissing sound intensified, echoing across the plains, and quickly threatened to pierce the sky.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a cloud of red mist erupted from each of the two hilltops, shooting high into the air.</p><p>There seemed to be a huge cave hidden within each summit.  The red mist appeared without warning, seemingly endless, instantly spreading out and covering half the sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The two clouds of red mist converged between the hills, blocking their path.</p><p>“There are snakes inside!” someone shouted, pointing at the fog.</p><p>“Hook Snakes!”</p><p>At this point, everyone finally got a glimpse of what was hidden within the red mist.</p><p>The mist was formed by the breath of a serpentine demonic beast!</p><p>These snakes had a bizarre appearance, their bodies shaped like serpents, each at least several dozen feet long. However, unlike ordinary snakes, the Hook Snakes had forked tails, each ending in an iron hook that gleamed like dark metal, flashing with a cold light!</p><p>Because of their unique appearance, everyone recognized the Hook Snakes instantly and recalled the records about them.</p><p>These demonic beasts reached the peak of the Mortal Demon stage upon maturity, and with enough cultivation, breaking through to the Demon Spirit stage wasn't difficult.</p><p>Their most potent weapon was their venom.</p><p>The red mist they exhaled not only served as a protective shield, helping them absorb attacks, but also contained a deadly poison. Even for cultivators, accidentally inhaling a mouthful or being exposed to the mist would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>Their tail hooks carried an even more lethal poison and were incredibly hard, capable of directly blocking attacks from magical artifacts!</p><p>Now, the red mist filled the sky, countless snake shadows writhing within.  It was impossible to tell how many Hook Snakes were concealed, but there were at least several dozen.  Even if only a small fraction had reached the Demon Spirit stage, it would be a huge problem!</p><p>Not to mention the possibility of even stronger demons at the mid or late Demon Spirit stage!</p><p>Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi exchanged glances, both puzzled. Before the Hook Snakes appeared, there were no signs of battle on the hills or below. How did Yu Kong avoid the Hook Snakes’ detection and slip through unnoticed?</p><p>But now was not the time to ponder these questions.</p><p>“Retreat to the cave!”</p><p>The two didn't dare hesitate any longer and immediately ordered a retreat!</p><p>The terrain here was wide open. Once surrounded by the snakes and trapped in the red mist, no one could guarantee their survival.</p><p>Only by relying on the narrow cave entrance could they set up formations, divide the snake horde, and slowly hunt them down.  No matter how powerful they were, the Hook Snakes were still just beasts.  With so many Foundation Establishment cultivators, they weren't necessarily afraid of them.</p><p>Following the orders, everyone formed a defensive formation and quickly retreated.</p><p>The hissing of the Hook Snakes rose and fell as the red mist rapidly spread, closing in on them.</p><p>"Be careful not to get injured. Don't let these monsters smell blood!"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi suddenly remembered something and shouted a warning.</p><p>Legend had it that Hook Snakes were extremely sensitive to the smell of blood, especially the blood of human cultivators. Once they caught the scent, they would enter a state of extreme frenzy, becoming entirely different creatures.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, two loud explosions erupted beneath their feet.</p><p>Everyone was startled and looked down to see two bursts of blood mist erupting from the abyss.</p><p>Flesh and bone fragments flew everywhere, mixed with blood, splattering in all directions.</p><p>Caught off guard, the group was instantly enveloped by two clouds of blood mist, one on each side.</p><p>“Crescent Fairy!”</p><p>Luo Xingnan's face drastically changed as he cried out in alarm.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi's expression was equally horrified, clearly recognizing Old Man Withered Vine as well.</p><p>At this moment, they suddenly understood.  No wonder there were no warning signs, no traces of battle…</p><p>Their spies had been exposed long ago. Yu Kong knew, but he turned a blind eye, allowing the spies to relay the information and luring them into the trap.</p><p>This was clearly a trap carefully orchestrated by Yu Kong!</p><p>His purpose might have been to use them as bait for the Hook Snakes, or perhaps he had even more sinister intentions…</p><p>"Quick! Wipe away the blood mist!"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi was the first to react, shouting urgently while unleashing a burst of crimson flames, attempting to burn away the bloody scent. The others naturally didn't dare to delay and quickly moved to erase the smell of blood.</p><p>But they were too late.</p><p>The red mist was hot on their heels. The moment the bodies exploded, the Hook Snakes had already caught the scent of blood.</p><p>Within the red mist, hidden from Luo Xingnan and the others, the Hook Snakes’ eyes suddenly turned crimson, fixated on the group above the abyss.</p><p>Their hissing intensified tenfold, a hundredfold.</p><p>Even more alarming, deep within the abyss, the Yin energy suddenly churned violently. Two enormous serpentine shadows, like arrows released from a bowstring, shot out of the abyss with earth-shattering roars at incredible speed!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and the others, hiding in the shadows, didn't dare to breathe, fearing that the frenzied Hook Snakes would catch their scent. Otherwise, they would meet the same fate as Luo Xingnan and his group.</p><p>―――――</p><p>Qin Sang stealthily observed Yu Kong’s hiding place.  Now that the Hook Snakes were completely distracted by Luo Xingnan and the others, Yu Kong showed no intention of taking advantage of the situation to sneak past from the other side and gather the herbs.</p><p>Did he plan to stay and watch the battle unfold, waiting for a victor before making his move?</p>
