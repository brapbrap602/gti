第1392章  Fallen Phoenix Jade

"This Penniless Daoist is still utterly bewildered. Everyone keeps talking about the conflict between the two races, but inexplicably we fought a Demon King, and then inexplicably a traitor from the Profound Heaven Palace and a treasure of the Profound Heaven Palace appeared. How much do you all actually know? Shouldn't you explain it to dispel this Penniless Daoist's confusion?"

Qin Sang waved his hand to stop Island Lord Shen and looked at Venerable Feng, asking in a cold voice.

The others exchanged a glance.

Venerable Feng produced a prepared explanation, "We also just learned of the demon race's scheme and haven't had time to tell Daoist friend…"

Qin Sang had obtained the greatest benefit and was only posturing to express his dissatisfaction, not wanting to investigate further. Hearing Venerable Feng's explanation, his expression softened slightly.

"This person was first hunted by the Profound Heaven Palace, fled into the demon territory, and was then chased here by the Rainbow Rat… What treasure did he bring out of the Profound Heaven Palace?"

Island Lord Shen shook his head. "I wasn't able to eavesdrop on any specific information. The Rainbow Rat probably didn't know the details either, only that the Profound Heaven Palace valued this item extremely highly and sent several elders to chase him into the depths of the demon territory, nearly alarming the Heavenly Roc Great Sage before giving up."

Heavenly Roc Great Sage.

A late-stage Transformation cultivator who admired the prestige of the ancient demon race's Great Sages and styled himself a Great Sage. He was infamous in the Northern Sea.

He hadn't obtained any useful information.

Qin Sang thought to himself that he could only wait until he opened the ice box to find out what the treasure was.

At this moment, Madam Yue, who had been silent all along, suddenly spoke, "Now that the treasure has fallen into the hands of the demon race, we might as well release the news…"

"Using a borrowed knife to kill!"

Island Lord Shen clapped his hands. "Shen also has this intention! Let's see if they can protect the treasure!"

Venerable Feng hesitated, saying with a hint of doubt, "I've heard that the Profound Heaven Palace has always acted domineeringly. I'm afraid that after the news spreads, the trouble might not only be theirs. The Profound Heaven Palace's treasure has appeared nearby, and we've all participated in the struggle for it. Even if we declare that the treasure was snatched away by the demon race, others may not believe us. I'm afraid it will attract too many people, and we won't be able to live in peace, backfiring on us. At that time, the situation will become even more complicated…"

As the overlord of this place, he didn't want to give others a reason to interfere.

Even someone as strong as Venerable Feng had people and forces he was wary of.

The black-shirted swordsman echoed, "This one still has to travel to other places and doesn't want to be watched all the time."

Madam Yue nodded slightly. "This concubine has considered it too simply."

Venerable Feng shook his head. "Madam Yue's suggestion also makes sense. We definitely can't let Bifang have an easy time. The news can be released, but we must carefully consider it."

Everyone nodded in agreement.

Next, they took out the ice boxes they had each seized.

Including Qin Sang's Snow-Patterned Cold Jade, the human race side had seized a total of eight ice boxes.

They were basically all kinds of spiritual materials used for refining treasures, of varying values. There were no spiritual medicines or the like, probably all consumed by the white-clothed man while fleeing for his life.

Qin Sang's eyes immediately landed on a piece of red jade inside one of the ice boxes.

*Swoosh!*

Qin Sang directly summoned the red jade into his hand and examined it carefully.

The red jade had wood-like patterns inside.

Holding it in his hand, he could feel a burst of warmth.

Seeing Qin Sang's actions, Island Lord Shen and the others frowned slightly.

Venerable Feng shook his head slightly and then looked at Qin Sang. "What? Daoist friend has taken a fancy to this Fallen Phoenix Jade?"

"Daoist Feng also recognizes this item?"

Qin Sang retracted his gaze and nodded. "This Penniless Daoist is looking for suitable spiritual materials to enhance my magical treasure. Fallen Phoenix Jade happens to meet the requirements. I wonder if you are willing to part with it?"

After a pause, Qin Sang took out the Snow-Patterned Cold Jade. "The value of the Fallen Phoenix Jade is the highest among these spiritual materials. This Penniless Daoist is willing to hand over this Snow-Patterned Cold Jade in exchange for only the Fallen Phoenix Jade."

The others exchanged glances.

Venerable Feng said, "The Snow-Patterned Cold Jade was seized by Daoist friend from Bifang. It should have belonged to Daoist Qin in the first place. Since Daoist friend says so, Feng has no objection."

Madam Yue happily said, "This concubine is about to refine an ice-attribute magical treasure. Half a piece of Snow-Patterned Cold Jade is enough. Thank you, Daoist Qin."

…

Qin Sang took the Fallen Phoenix Jade and retreated to the side, watching Venerable Feng and the others divide the remaining spiritual materials.

Everyone was happy.

Venerable Feng prepared to counterattack the demon race.

Speed was of the essence, and Island Lord Shen and the others immediately returned to make arrangements.

Before long, only Qin Sang and Venerable Feng remained in the hall.

Venerable Feng said apologetically, "I should have waited for the demon race to retreat before fulfilling my promise to take Daoist friend to Hundred Flowers Valley. The situation has changed, and Feng is afraid that he will be unable to get away in a short time. I can write a letter of introduction for Daoist friend to visit the Valley Lord of Hundred Flowers Valley. Or Daoist friend can stay as a guest for a while longer, and when this place is stable, I will accompany Daoist friend there?"

Hearing this, Qin Sang pondered in silence.

Hearing that Venerable Feng and the others were preparing to spread the news, he decided to leave this place of trouble as soon as possible.

He was weak and alone.

If the experts of the Profound Heaven Palace or other great forces came to his door, it would not be easy to deal with them.

However, his request to see the Valley Lord of Hundred Flowers Valley was not only for exchanging insights. If Hundred Flowers Valley had unique insect-controlling secret techniques, he also wanted to seek advice. A single letter of introduction would not be enough to build a closer relationship.

After thinking for a while, Qin Sang said, "Then this Penniless Daoist will wait for a while longer. I have nothing to do anyway, so this Penniless Daoist will continue to guard Hunting Star Island for Daoist Feng. If there is a chance to hunt down demons like Bifang, this Penniless Daoist also wants to vent some anger."

Venerable Feng was overjoyed.

After bidding farewell to Venerable Feng, Qin Sang flew back to Hunting Star Island without stopping.

He still left the Nascent Soul talisman puppet in the cave dwelling as before.

Qin Sang himself遁入to a nearby reef, took out a set of array flags, and laid down layers of restrictions before taking out the mysterious ice box.

"What a complex seal. I wonder what treasure is inside…"

Qin Sang picked up the ice box and carefully examined it.

The ice box was crystal clear, but not transparent, with a pale white interior.

He didn't know if the white light was the power of the seal or emanated from the treasure itself. Even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly could only see a ball of white light and could not see what it was.

"Hiss! The one who made this Ice Box seems to be Ten Thousand Year Profound Ice!"

Qin Sang was secretly shocked.

The Profound Heaven Palace was truly generous, using rare Ten Thousand Year Profound Ice to make an Ice Box for storing items.

This discovery made Qin Sang even more expectant.

Unexpectedly, an hour passed, and Qin Sang had no clue, feeling like he didn't know where to start.

He looked at the Ice Box over and over, urging his divine sense. With the cooperation of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he carefully analyzed the seal on the Ice Box, and unconsciously, a day and a night passed.

The second day, at night.

Qin Sang was full of fatigue. After a while in meditation, he continued to pick up the Ice Box.

His expression became extremely solemn.

"The seal is seamless, but that's not the most difficult part. Inside the Ice Box, there seems to be an extremely violent force. I don't know if it's just my imagination…"

Thoughts flashed in his mind, and Qin Sang decided to try, placing the jade box on the ground.

Then, a gentle force surged from Qin Sang's palm, slowly approaching the Ice Box.

Time seemed to slow down.

Qin Sang's movements were extremely gentle.

Finally, the surface of the Ice Box flashed with a faint light, and faint blue threads faintly emerged from the Ten Thousand Year Profound Ice, revealing the power of the seal.
