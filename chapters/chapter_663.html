<h1>Chapter 655:  Ancient Corpse from the Heavens</h1><p>A tall figure suddenly appeared outside the mountain gate.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a terrifying aura swept over, instantly descending.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The already crumbling headmaster’s hall collapsed with a resounding crash.</p><p>Dust and smoke billowed.</p><p>“No good! Run!”</p><p>Du Xian, terrified, summoned his magical weapon and fled in another direction.</p><p>A blood-red centipede with wings flew out from Du Xian’s dantian, cried out to him in distress, then turned and charged toward the enemy.  Du Xian was ruthless; seeing the situation was dire, he abandoned his spirit insect to buy time.</p><p>Unfortunately, the difference in strength was too great; everything he did was doomed to be in vain.</p><p>The blood centipede was ferocious-looking and carried a strange poison; contact meant instant death.</p><p>Ordinary cultivators feared the potent poison and would avoid it at all costs.</p><p>But the blood centipede hadn’t flown far when a ghostly claw suddenly snatched at it.</p><p>The blood centipede hastily dodged, but the ghostly claw was faster, easily seizing the centipede and ignoring its venom.  The corpse aura surged wildly, enveloping the centipede, then crushed it with a squeeze.</p><p>The blood centipede, a poisonous insect with a weak body, died instantly from the corpse aura.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>Du Xian spat out blood, his figure faltered slightly.  Suddenly feeling a tightening sensation, he cried out inwardly, realizing it was too late to fight back.</p><p>A sword light shattered his protective magical weapon. The next moment, Qin Sang appeared beside Du Xian, easily subduing him with a hand on the back of his neck.</p><p>On the other side, after the flying yaksha eliminated the blood centipede, a cultivator named Jiushan, who was just getting up from a chair, was captured without a chance to resist.</p><p>Qin Sang darted back to the headmaster’s hall, threw Du Xian and Jiushan together, and struck out with spiritual energy to clear away the rubble, revealing Cui Xuanzi’s corpse.</p><p>“You were lucky to escape.”</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted.</p><p>After searching the soul of the Li Witch Palace disciple, Qin Sang learned that the Five Insect Sect had secretly hidden a Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit tree in Black Wind Valley. He had meticulously searched every inch of Black Wind Valley that day but failed to find it.</p><p>This was because Black Wind Valley had a strange ancient restriction; only when the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit ripened would its unique fragrance escape, merging with the poisonous spring and thus be discovered.</p><p>For some reason, the existence of the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit was known to a Golden Core cultivator of the Li Witch Palace.  It happened that his senior disciple, Du Xian, whose spirit insect was a poisonous insect, had a chance to achieve a third transformation by consuming the fruit.</p><p>Du Xian’s purpose in coming here was twofold: to find the ancient corpse, and to steal the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit to help his spirit insect transform.</p><p>The Li Witch Palace’s pursuit of Ya Gu was unrelated to their search for the ancient corpse and was not because Qin Sang's identity was exposed. Instead, Cui Xuanzi, to save himself, had shifted the blame, accusing him of stealing the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit, thus causing Ya Gu to be targeted by the Li Witch Palace.</p><p>Having captured Cui Xuanzi, Qin Sang would definitely not let him off easily.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Cui Xuanzi, knowing he wouldn’t have a good ending, committed suicide – a true overlord until the end.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to put Cui Xuanzi’s corpse into his corpse puppet bag, he sensed something unusual in his abdomen. Using his true energy, he dug out something from his Qi Sea: two Phantom-Tailed Scorpions.</p><p>“Twin Gu?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised, turning the two scorpions, one large and one small, in his hands.</p><p>They were indeed Cui Xuanzi’s blood-refined spirit insects, connected to his life; upon his suicide, they too died.</p><p>Twin Gu had many legends in the Witch Clan, but verified instances were rarely known, or perhaps it was because the Western Frontier was too remote.</p><p>One of the two Phantom-Tailed Scorpions was only at the peak of its first transformation.</p><p>The other scorpion was in a very strange state, its body tightly curled up, covered by a thin membrane.  Its entire body was becoming almost as ethereal as its tail.</p><p>“It's transforming, and its head is already fading; it's almost finished. In a few hours, it will complete its transformation and become a three-transformed scorpion! Cui Xuanzi fed it the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit and used the other scorpion to deceive the Li Witch Palace, blaming himself for stealing the fruit. He used Ya Gu to divert their attention and buy time. Once the Phantom-Tailed Scorpion finished transforming, its power would skyrocket; killing them would be easy.  What a clever scheme!”</p><p>Qin Sang said hatefully, instantly understanding Cui Xuanzi's plan.</p><p>The transformation process for every spirit insect is different.</p><p>Some spirit insects take years to mature, such as the Skyeye Butterfly and the Dusk Bug.  Others transform in just a few months, or even days.</p><p>The third transformation cocoon of the Illusion-tailed Poison Scorpion only takes half a month.  With the master's help, the transformation can be even faster after it's refined into a life-bound insect.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi desperately sought the Thousand-handed Spider Fruit.</p><p>For a hundred years, he used every means possible, leveraging the residual power of his sect's Golden Core cultivators to intimidate the Jinglei Stronghold and the Hundred Flowers Palace. After Qin Sang appeared, he became subservient, using Qin Sang's influence to scare off the two powerful factions, finally securing Black Wind Valley.</p><p>Unexpectedly, fate intervened. Just as success seemed imminent, news of the Thousand-handed Spider Fruit somehow leaked to the Liwu Palace, who then stormed the sect to seize it.</p><p>Faced with overwhelming odds, Cui Xuanzi remained calm, maneuvering amidst the chaos and meticulously buying time.  Once his life-bound insect completed its transformation, his chances of forming a Golden Core would greatly increase.  He could then leave the Western Frontier, change his identity, and eventually make a comeback.</p><p>He almost succeeded.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't anticipate Qin Sang's swift return to the Xiong Mountain region with the Crimson Fire Gilded Net, allowing for rapid insect capture.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi, knowing he had betrayed Qin Sang and implicated Ya Gu, committed suicide, accepting his culpability and avoiding punishment.</p><p>Qin Sang had to admit he had underestimated the man.</p><p>His own perspective shifted after achieving Golden Core.</p><p>It proved that even in the cultivation world, cultivation level doesn't define everything.  Underestimating anyone, even a lowly Foundation Establishment cultivator, can lead to a disastrous fall—a lesson Dongyang Bo learned well. Qin Sang paid the price.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was complex, his gaze hardening, his demeanor subtly changing.  He approached the three Liwu Palace disciples, wasting no words.  Before Du Xian, he began soul-searching the other two.</p><p>The soul-searching technique was brutally displayed before Du Xian.</p><p>After the soul-searching, Jiu Shan and the other disciple's souls were annihilated, denying them even reincarnation.</p><p>Hearing the agonizing screams of his fellow disciples, Du Xian, terrified, was completely broken.</p><p>"Answer my questions."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes fixed on Du Xian, his tone icy, devoid of warmth.  "What is the Seven Killing Hall? Where is it?"</p><p>From the soul-searching, Qin Sang gleaned a vision:  a towering, majestic tower, radiating ancient, weathered energy, like an ancient divine object piercing the clouds. A severed arm corpse, emanating corpse qi, descended from the heavens, but vanished just as it was about to fall from the clouds.</p><p>Their master referred to this as the "Heaven-sent Corpse." He had gone to a place called the Seven Killing Hall, and upon his return, instructed them to search for a severed-arm corpse.</p>
