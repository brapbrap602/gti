<h1>Chapter 1639: Five Elements</h1><p>Chapter 1639: Five Elements</p><p>Qin Sang's protective True Qi surged, yet the poison needle pierced through it instantly, unstoppable.  The poison needle was insidious, specifically designed to break through protective True Qi.</p><p>A critical moment.</p><p>A ray of light burst from his dantian, a pearl-like image flickering. The poison pearl gifted by Fei Can had been refined into Qin Sang's body, granting him the ability to dispel poison at will.  Perhaps "Poison-Dispelling Shield" would better describe the light's current form.</p><p>Seven-colored light condensed between Qin Sang and the poison needle, forming a small, shimmering shield, no bigger than a baby's hand, appearing perfectly in front of the needle.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>Against the sharp poison needle, the seven-colored light appeared exceptionally thin.  Unsurprisingly, the needle pierced it.  However, after penetrating the light, the poison needle seemed to meet resistance, its unstoppable momentum hindered. Though it eventually pierced through, there was a noticeable pause.</p><p>That minuscule pause was enough for Qin Sang to react.  He flapped his phoenix wings, his lightning-fast escape leaving a zigzagging trail in the air.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The poison needle and the escaping figure narrowly missed each other. The needle flew into the sky, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man's sneer froze on his bark-like face.  Qin Sang reappeared unharmed nearby.  With a thought, the poison pearl flew out of his dantian, retracting the light. Seeing the poison pearl, still somewhat illusory and not fully solidified, he was surprised.</p><p>The pearl, after all, was separated from Fei Can's body, inherently weaker than Fei Can himself. And Fei Can only possessed the cultivation of early Fourth Transformation, clearly inferior to the Jade-armored insect.</p><p>The poison needle wasn't just the Jade-armored insect's ability. The grotesque-faced man, willing to suffer backlash, had pushed the insect's potential, unleashing a carefully planned, devastating Heaven-Shattering Soul-Destroying Needle.</p><p>Such a deadly attack had been neutralized by the poison pearl!</p><p>Even with the poison pearl, Qin Sang wouldn't bet his life on a single treasure without understanding the enemy's strength.  He had at least three ways to counter the Heaven-Shattering Soul-Destroying Needle. The poison pearl was only the first.</p><p>If the pearl failed, there was the Sky-Eyed Butterfly; its Sky-Eyed light was already poised. The poison needle, fundamentally, was a technique the grotesque-faced man used through the blood-armored insect.</p><p>As a last resort, there was the gift from Wan Du Mountain.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man was severely depleted and suffering backlash.  Activating the fluff would assault his mind, disrupting the poison needle, providing an opportunity to escape. He hadn't used it earlier, partly for his own safety—in case the man had a powerful trump card—and partly because the situation was still under control, waiting for the optimal moment to strike.</p><p>After all, he aimed to eliminate the grotesque-faced man permanently, not just repel him.</p><p>The poison pearl's performance exceeded expectations. He hadn't needed his other two backup plans. Qin Sang realized he'd underestimated Fei Can. The creature hadn't disgraced its divine silkworm lineage. If Fei Can itself had been there, it might have been able to face the Jade-armored insect, and even if defeated, it wouldn't have been a disastrous loss.</p><p>Joy and sorrow rarely coincide.  Qin Sang and the grotesque-faced man's moods were worlds apart.</p><p>The carefully laid death trap, broken by a mere seven-colored light, was unacceptable to the grotesque-faced man. He knew exactly what the failure of the Heaven-Shattering Soul-Destroying Needle meant.</p><p>To make matters worse, the blood-armored insect disobeyed, its wings vibrating rapidly and shrilly, showing its agitation. It suddenly turned and attacked the grotesque-faced man.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The blood-armored insect burrowed into the grotesque-faced man's forehead, through the existing wound.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man's expression became even more distorted and terrifying. His fighting spirit vanished, and he let out a desperate howl.</p><p>The ten-thousand-year-old trees, not yet consumed by fire, instantly withered; their leaves turned yellow and fell, their wood spirit essence violently absorbed by the grotesque-faced man.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The grotesque-faced man heavily stamped the ground and charged madly toward the edge of the fire ring, like a bull. After this fierce battle, vast tracts of forest were engulfed in magical fire, significantly reducing his maneuvering space.</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was time to finish this.  He made every effort to stop the man's escape.  He slightly adjusted his position and pressed his palm, summoning three Sun God Birds from the divine tree to chase the grotesque-faced man.  He no longer held back his avatar, expending his True Qi and summoning the spirit treasure, awakening the giant snake.</p><p>The already devastated forest became even more chaotic.</p><p>Everywhere, ash filled the air, withered trees and broken trunks littered the ground, the earth was scorched black and red, ancient halls and buildings lay in ruins, and deep pits scarred the land from the residual force of the battle…</p><p>No beauty remained.</p><p>Black magical flames compressed inwards.</p><p>Within the ring of fire, the Sunbird and the Serpent circled above, forming a net in the sky, trapping the Treant in the center.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body precisely controlled the firebirds, seizing the opportune moment.</p><p>His incarnation, however, was merciless, relentlessly attacking with his spiritual treasures, regardless of the rapid depletion of his true essence.</p><p>The monster faced relentless pursuit, repeatedly pushed back by the combined efforts of Qin Sang and his incarnation.  He roared in fury, but his roars were weak and desperate. The incessant nagging of the Crying Spirit Cave Master further agitated him.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Enraged, the monster grabbed the evil spirit.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master let out a scream and fell silent.</p><p>With a fierce look in his eyes, the monster looked up at Qin Sang as he fled, shouting, "I bear you no grudge! I offered you the chance for Ascension, spare my life, let's call it even! I swear on my demonic obsession that I will never seek revenge, and I will avoid you at all costs, wherever and whenever I meet you!"</p><p>"You know where there's a chance for Ascension?"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was playful as he appeared beside the Sun God Tree, looking down at the monster.</p><p>The words ‘Ascension’ were enough for even the ruthless Qin Sang to pause and consider. This person clearly possessed the legacy of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, perhaps he really did know something.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn't stop attacking. His attacks remained fierce.</p><p>The monster cried out, "The chance for Ascension is at Emperor's Mandate Mountain. Zhu Wudao and Old Daoist Purple Thunder are eyeing it. Even with your strength, you can't fight them alone. Let's make peace, and I'll help you obtain the chance for Ascension!"</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A divine bird swooped down.</p><p>The monster was about to use the same trick again, but the Serpent seized the opportunity, spewing a blast of cold flames onto him. Qin Sang's incarnation and his main body worked together with perfect coordination.</p><p>The monster felt an icy chill, his body froze, and in his terror, he hastily used a secret technique to escape.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The withered tree was obliterated by the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>The monster escaped to another location, his left arm severed at the elbow, the broken end emitting the smell of burning flesh, his final words a mix of screams and distorted speech.</p><p>Gritting his teeth in pain, the monster looked up to see Qin Sang, without pause, summoning three more Sunbirds.  His eyelids twitched nervously.</p><p>Qin Sang attacked while questioning, "If there's a chance for Ascension at Emperor's Mandate Mountain, why didn't Zhu Wudao and the Eight Views go there first, instead of the cliff?"</p><p>"Because the teleportation array leads to the Immortal Palace. The Immortal Palace has better chances, easier to obtain! The Sword Tomb alone can sustain the continuous Ascension of both Daoist and Buddhist sects!"</p><p>The monster indeed knew many secrets.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang understood why the Daoist and Buddhist sects sealed off the Immortal Palace and hunted down the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. Such a secret realm couldn’t be shared; possessing it would ensure the sect's prosperity for generations to come.</p><p>He didn't know what the Sword Tomb was.</p><p>The name sounded like a burial ground for swords. Could the fragments of the Earth Slaughter Sword have been discovered there?</p><p>"Why did the teleportation array fail?" Qin Sang asked, feigning ignorance.</p><p>"The Immortal Palace has changed!"</p><p>The monster, unsure of the specifics, played coy, "The path is cut off! Only Emperor's Mandate Mountain remains! Zhu Wudao was intercepted by the Daoist sect, and used the secrets of Emperor's Mandate Mountain to get the Crying Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xingdao to help him escape…"</p><p>"Zhu Wudao… the mastermind escaped?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised an eyebrow. If he hadn't been focused on the cultivation technique, and had retreated a little slower at the cliff palace, Zhu Wudao would likely have tried to recruit him.</p><p>The Water Phase Hall concealed an Ascension array; it wasn't surprising that Emperor's Mandate Mountain held the chance for Ascension.</p><p>His mind raced, then he sharply shouted, "That means you only just learned this secret from Zhu Wudao, you didn't know before.  If so, what in the Wuxiang Immortal Sect is more important than the Sword Tomb, worth sacrificing the chance to be among the first to enter the Immortal Palace?"</p><p>The monster's expression faltered.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, "Asking you to help me obtain the chance for Ascension is like collaborating with a tiger! The descendants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and the Daoist sect are clashing, allowing me to benefit.  Furthermore, with my cultivation, either side would eagerly recruit me, why bother with this extra step!"</p><p>His incarnation chimed in, "We need you less than that!"</p><p>Before the words finished, Qin Sang increased his attack.</p><p>The fire ring contracted rapidly, the monster becoming a trapped beast.</p><p>The monster's gaze flickered, "You guessed right, the Wood Phase Hall holds a legacy that appeals to me more, and I've already obtained it."</p><p>"This is a mystical secret technique, a closely guarded secret of the Wuxiang Sect!"</p><p>"Friend, your good fortune is profound! The opportunity for Ascension is readily available!"</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, his face unconvinced.</p><p>The Mu Xiang Palace held a status equal to the Shui Xiang Palace.  Perhaps it once possessed treasures comparable to the Transcendence Array, but such things are not easily obtained.</p><p>For the disfigured man to expect him to believe his empty words was a fool's errand.</p><p>"Do you know the key to Ascension?"</p><p>The disfigured man's tone suddenly calmed.</p><p>"Still trying to play tricks!" Qin Sang shouted, attacking mercilessly.</p><p>The disfigured man, pressed relentlessly, could only suppress his anger, repeatedly saying, "Ascension, compared to the Yuan Ying stage, lies in the initial ability to manipulate the world's spiritual energy, controlling wind and rain, comparable to a deity, wielding heavenly power. Therefore, the difficulty of Ascension lies in the attunement with Heaven and Man!"</p><p>"Attunement with Heaven and Man?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>The term "attunement with Heaven and Man" had a broad meaning.</p><p>Ascension should not yet reach the level of sensing the Dao.</p><p>The disfigured man must be referring to the most superficial aspect.</p><p>These words were like lightning, flashing through Qin Sang's mind, and he seemed to understand something.</p><p>"You don't know? No wonder I can't figure out your background; you're a wandering cultivator!"</p><p>The disfigured man saw the change in Qin Sang, seizing the opportunity to gloat, but also fearing Qin Sang's wrath, immediately added, "The world's spiritual energy is divided into five elements, and the key lies in these five elements!"</p><p>"Spiritual Roots!"</p><p>Qin Sang was both surprised and astonished.</p><p>Those with five-element spiritual roots find attunement with Heaven and Man easier, sensing the five-element spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth.  Everyone knows that these seemingly useless cultivators suddenly become geniuses during Ascension!</p><p>No!</p><p>Qin Sang thought of himself.  His cultivation journey had been one of hardship and bloodshed.</p><p>With a combination of five-element spiritual roots, his internal true energy was chaotic, making cultivation and breakthroughs significantly more difficult than for those with a single superior spiritual root.  Cultivators with five spiritual roots wouldn't even dare hope for the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Without his numerous opportunities and the jade Buddha's assistance allowing him to utilize unconventional methods, his chances of reaching the Nascent Soul stage were incredibly slim.</p><p>How could a dramatic transformation occur during Ascension?</p><p>"Those who cultivate to our level are all geniuses. Even three spiritual roots are extremely rare.  Those with inferior spiritual roots, even with incredible luck, face life-or-death struggles before reaching the Nascent Soul stage.  I can give you a secret technique to compensate for your spiritual root deficiencies!"</p><p>The disfigured man was certain Qin Sang couldn't possibly have inferior spiritual roots.</p><p>This secret technique was incredibly valuable. If it were revealed, all the sects in the cultivation world would be in an uproar. He didn't believe Qin Sang wouldn't be interested.</p><p>"Spiritual roots can be compensated for?"</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed.</p><p>"No, it's using external objects to replace the function of spiritual roots, allowing for the same attunement with the world's spiritual energy," the disfigured man, having only this bargaining chip left, explained everything.  "That object is one's innate treasure, which every cultivator possesses.  This technique is also an artifact refining technique; it allows for the refinement of the Heavenly Linglong, which is then integrated into your innate treasure.  Years of nurturing will aid attunement with Heaven and Man.  In those days, only two Palace Masters in the Mu Xiang Palace were eligible to learn this technique, and the Heavenly Linglong was only traded among the true inheritors of the Wuxiang Sect."</p><p>"I have a superior fire-element spiritual root. What spiritual root would a Heavenly Linglong substitute for?  Does it encompass all five elements?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately saw the flaw in the disfigured man's words.</p><p>Su Zinan gave him the alias Fire Demon.</p><p>Qin Sang claimed to have a superior fire-element spiritual root, and nobody would doubt it.</p><p>To gain Qin Sang's trust, the disfigured man could only hastily explain, "The Heavenly Linglong can freely transform between the five elements and can be refined by cultivators of any of the five elements.  Its name implies this versatility. However, after being integrated into an innate treasure, the Heavenly Linglong can only be fixed as one of the five elements, and a person can only integrate one Heavenly Linglong."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's frown,</p><p>the disfigured man anxiously said, "Friend, you have a superior spiritual root. One Heavenly Linglong would greatly increase your chances of Ascension!"</p><p>However, a genius is still a genius.</p><p>Attunement with Heaven and Man is the key, but it's only one aspect of Ascension.  Simultaneous self-transformation is also required.</p><p>Those with superior spiritual roots are not incapable of attunement with Heaven and Man; it's just more difficult. Their true energy is pure, making self-breakthroughs easier.  This inner transformation is another path.</p><p>Those with five-element spiritual roots may find attunement with Heaven and Man easier, but their self-cultivation is far more complex.</p><p>At the Ascension level, cultivators with five-element spiritual roots seem to have an advantage, but on the entire cultivation path, those with superior spiritual roots encounter the Ascension bottleneck earlier and have more time to comprehend it.  They don't need to pursue all five elements; compensating for even one element is invaluable.</p><p>The disfigured man dared not withhold any information, revealing the Heavenly Linglong's value.</p><p>He believed it was enough to sway Qin Sang.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang seemed uninterested in Ascension and showed no mercy, filling him with great resentment.</p><p>Anger welled up in his heart.</p><p>The disfigured man roared to the heavens, "The Mu Xiang legacy is broken, and only I know the method to refine the Heavenly Linglong! If you kill me, you'll never get it elsewhere!"</p><p>Then, the disfigured man suddenly raised his right arm.</p><p>The malevolent spirit was trapped in his hand.</p><p>Spiritual energy surged, repeatedly flashing the pained and terrified face of the Crying Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>"No…"</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>A fierce light erupted from the disfigured man's eyes.  With a forceful squeeze, the malevolent spirit was annihilated!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Bingyi Palace trembled violently.</p><p>The palace collapsed layer by layer.</p><p>The azure light swelled high, on the verge of collapse, and the flag formation could no longer hold!</p>
