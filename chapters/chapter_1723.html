<h1>Chapter 1714: The Path</h1><p>True energy circulated.  </p><p>After completing a full cycle, Qin Sang awoke from meditation.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings fluttering, emitting a faint glow in the dim cave.</p><p>After absorbing the tribulation lightning that struck Qin Sang, the patterns on its wings had subtly changed, becoming not only more exquisite but also sharper.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways; unlike the butterfly, he couldn't afford to be carefree.</p><p>After achieving the Nascent Soul stage, the path ahead should have been clear.</p><p>As Gui Mu had said, upon reaching this realm, Qin Sang sensed a gateway to this world, pointing towards the east.</p><p>Following that inexplicable sensation, even without a sea chart, he wouldn't get lost in the storm zone.</p><p>As expected, like his predecessors, Qin Sang would continue his cultivation in this world for some time, prepare thoroughly, then cross the Sea of Ruin to the east, ascend through the gateway, and enter a new world.</p><p>The Heavenly Demon's Sound had thrown everything into disarray!</p><p>His soul insect, the Sky-Eye Butterfly, was at the peak of its fourth transformation.  After Qin Sang reached Nascent Soul, he used the *Pan Hu True Scripture*’s soul nurturing method to cultivate it. Although he couldn't refine the Frost Jade Pill, there was still hope for it to achieve its fifth transformation, but now he had to be cautious.</p><p>Since the insect lacked sentience, the Heavenly Demon's Sound likely had a more profound effect on it than on cultivators and demons.</p><p>"I can only rely on myself… how can I rapidly increase my strength?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>If it came to that, if he forcibly crossed the Sea of Ruin, only sufficient strength would offer a chance of survival.</p><p>He calmed his mind and silently practiced the *Meta-Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*.</p><p>The eleventh layer of the cultivation technique appeared in his mind.</p><p>When comprehending the Nascent Soul stage section, Qin Sang sensed that the killing intent of this killing-focused technique seemed to be weakening. Throughout the Nascent Soul stage, he hadn't deliberately cultivated killing intent or engaged in widespread slaughter.</p><p>The rewards from repeatedly challenging powerful opponents far surpassed his level were enough to support his comprehension of the technique.</p><p>The subsequent cultivation techniques confirmed this.</p><p>The eleventh layer involved condensing a sword spirit, shifting from accumulating killing symbols and sword souls through slaughter to integrating the killing intent into oneself, differentiating the sword spirit!</p><p>"Rather than saying the killing intent weakened, it's more accurate to say that the technique's creator no longer needed to use 'killing' as a means, having reached a higher realm and standing on a higher level!  There's no need for indiscriminate slaughter, no need to pursue external killing symbols and sword souls; the killing intent has become the way!"</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang grasped the essence of this technique, comprehending the creator's journey.  What followed was shock.</p><p>Before the tenth layer, the sword symbols, sword souls, etc., were like the creator's repeated attempts.</p><p>He gained enlightenment through killing, but initially only obtained external things, struggling along until he broke through to the Nascent Soul stage, and finally found his own way!</p><p>Qin Sang could even sense the creator's arduous journey.</p><p>"Could it be that this predecessor created the technique from scratch, step by step?"</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed.</p><p>He could create cultivation techniques now; it shouldn't be difficult before the Golden Core stage.  However, after reaching Nascent Soul, it would require considerable thought and effort to deduce.</p><p>This was because his realm was high enough, with centuries of accumulated foundation, allowing him to have a broader perspective.</p><p>After reaching Nascent Soul, beyond his realm, Qin Sang found it difficult to control the direction, and straying from the path could ruin hundreds of years of cultivation, leading to immeasurable regret.</p><p>Qin Sang was self-aware; a self-created technique might not be suitable for him; it was safer to follow established methods.</p><p>In the Foundation Establishment and Qi Refinement stages, facing daily uncertainty and unawareness, he didn't understand the Dao, couldn't see the path ahead, and lacked other techniques for verification. How could he have the ability to create his own technique?</p><p>Qin Sang knew that cultivators in the world were countless, and brilliant individuals were numerous; so-called geniuses were as common as fish in the river.</p><p>The predecessor who created the *Meta-Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*, if Qin Sang's guess was correct, must have been an unparalleled genius even in the vast world.</p><p>What was the outcome of such a person?</p><p>Ascension to immortality, or…</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but think of the assembled Earth Slaughter Sword in his dantian.</p><p>Hopefully, it wasn't a case of the sword breaking and the person dying!</p><p>After breaking through to Nascent Soul, Qin Sang expected the sword spirit to respond again.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sword spirit remained unresponsive.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the thoughts the sword spirit had conveyed, urging him to find more fragments.</p><p>He had obtained two Earth Slaughter Sword fragments in the Xuan Tian Palace's sacred grounds. The fragments automatically pieced themselves together into the Earth Slaughter Sword, but it wasn't enough to awaken the sword spirit.</p><p>"Can the sword spirit hear the Heavenly Demon's Sound?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of this question.  The Earth Slaughter Sword had only recently been restored, and it was unclear whether any more fragments remained. The sword spirit should still be weak and its current state unknown.</p><p>The sword spirit surely knows many secrets.  Once it awakens, perhaps we can master this peerless sword and uncover the mystery of the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>Qin Sang realized he had several paths before him.  The East Sea Abyss, the Ascension Platform, the sword spirit – he could also check the Seven Killing Hall in the Canglang Sea to see if it had ascended.  Any of these paths could solve his problems.</p><p>Speaking of sword spirits… he had one too!</p><p>With a thought, the Yunyou Sword emerged from his brow.</p><p>Qin Sang silently cultivated the *Sacrifice Yuan Technique*, performing the secret art.  The effect was far superior to when he was a Nascent Soul cultivator, filling him with joy.  Once the Jiao wood true spirit matured, he could wield his natal spirit sword.</p><p>His understanding of the cultivation method showed that once the sword soul was born and integrated into the killing array, the power of the Seven Souls Killing Array would greatly increase, giving him a better chance of survival in the Abyss.  But without the power of his natal spirit sword, its effectiveness would always be slightly lacking.</p><p>The Disperse-Earth Sword spirit and the Yunyou Sword true spirit both needed patient waiting.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his fingers on his knees, recalling another sword array, the *Seven Mansions Division Sword Array*, obtained from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>After obtaining this sword array, Qin Sang hadn't cultivated it, but he had studied it somewhat, grasping its key principles.  Their encounter with the Five Elements Divine Prohibition on Emperor Grant Mountain showed just how extraordinary this array was.  If it weren't for Zhu Wu Dao's scheming that weakened the array's foundation, they might still be trapped there even after the arrival of the Transcendental Ascension cultivator.</p><p>Unless the enemy was incredibly powerful and could break through by force, or they could find the main star – the location of the array master – they would have to endure the array's attacks.</p><p>The Seven Mansions correspond to the White Tiger Seven Mansions.  Each mansion’s location could serve as an array eye. While one person controlling the array is powerful, it's not the complete array.  Gathering seven top-tier sword cultivators, each mastering a mansion, would allow the array to possess boundless changes.  It’s a fundamental secret art of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's Golden Aspect lineage.</p><p>The *Yuan Shen Sword Cultivation Chapter* could precisely divide the sword soul into seven parts. Then, these divided sword souls could each control a mansion, while the main body controls the overall situation, creating illusions and making it hard to distinguish reality from falsehood.</p><p>Qin Sang could deploy this grand array alone!  And the *Seven Mansions Division Sword Array* doesn't require a natal spirit sword.</p><p>Besides that, the most immediate solution was to continue improving the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. As long as he obtained suitable spirit fire, he could continuously improve his divine sense. This secret technique wouldn't be limited by the insufficient spiritual energy of this world.</p><p>After reaching the Transcendental Ascension stage, Qin Sang felt he was nearing the limit of this world.  Even in the early stages of Transcendental Ascension, his cultivation was subtly restricted by external factors.  The damaged Four Saints Spirit Gathering Array was far less effective for Transcendental Ascension cultivators than it was for Nascent Soul cultivators, and it wouldn't last much longer anyway.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that it was extremely difficult for cultivators in this world to break through to the mid-Transcendental Ascension stage. Even if they somehow managed it, ascending to the higher realms would involve facing heavenly tribulation and the pressure of lifespan, making it a losing proposition.</p><p>He guessed that most Transcendental Ascension cultivators in this world ascended to the higher realms from the early stages of Transcendental Ascension, with very few exceptions potentially possessing extraordinary opportunities.</p><p>Currently, ordinary spirit fire couldn't meet the requirements of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>Qin Sang set his sights on the Nanming Li Fire, hoping for a breakthrough.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang put away the Yunyou Sword and activated the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. The fire lotus and the Sun God Tree both floated before him.</p><p>He had complete control over the fire lotus.  Controlling the Sun God Tree was also much easier than before.</p><p>Qin Sang first used the fire lotus to draw in the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>Black and crimson flames flickered in the cave, casting shadows on Qin Sang’s face, sometimes dark, sometimes bright. The fire lotus hovered above the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite his best efforts, Qin Sang couldn't make the fire lotus absorb even a single spark of the Nanming Li Fire. This demonstrated the fire's far higher order than the Transcendental Ascension stage.</p><p>No wonder the fire bird, formed merely from the condensed aura of the demonic fire, possessed such terrifying power.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, giving up the attempt. He held the Sun God Tree in his palm, gazing at it for a while, then closed his eyes slightly, activating his divine sense to summon the Sun God Birds.</p><p>On the branches, the flames on the nine Sun God Birds shone one after another.</p><p>He was actually trying to summon nine birds simultaneously!</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Qin Sang’s body trembled, his expression changing slightly, and he hurriedly ended the cultivation.</p><p>"I shouldn't be too ambitious!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. His current goal should be to control six birds freely, which would be enough to deal with most situations in this world.</p><p>"It seems I have to go to the Canglang Sea.  I hope the Nine Phoenix King's remaining feather is still there…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, but he didn't plan to leave immediately.  He'd wait at least until the affairs in the Central Plains were settled.</p><p>He hadn't yet decided how to deal with the Hui Guang Saint and the Qing Hu Saint King. Personal grudges, the path to ascension, the world's affairs – too many things were intertwined.</p><p>After the *Yuan Shen Sword Cultivation Chapter* and the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* came the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*.</p><p>These three cultivation techniques were painstakingly selected by Qin Sang over hundreds of years from numerous ancient texts. They are tailored to his constitution, maximizing the jade Buddha's potential, mitigating risks, and achieving the harmonious cultivation of spirit, energy, and body.</p><p>*Tian Yao Lian Xing* is currently lagging, but catching up shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>During his tribulation, Qin Sang used the Yin Fire tribulation to forge his body, with remarkable results.</p><p>He took out the Star Platform and sat cross-legged on it.</p><p>After a brief run of *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, Qin Sang immediately felt the difference. His body was broken and reborn, his progress incredibly fast. He estimated he would soon reach the mid-fourth stage.</p><p>If he could elevate his physical body to the Nascent Soul level before ascension, his chances of survival in the Gui Xu would undoubtedly increase significantly.</p><p>An image flashed in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Back then, at the Di Shou Mountain of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, a female cultivator designed a Five Elements Divine Restriction, luring them into the Nine-Yuan Magnetic field to fight for treasures.  Master Huai Yin was the first to be ambushed.</p><p>Master Huai Yin was critically injured, facing certain death, yet he somehow used some secret technique to instantly recover from his injuries, regaining his full strength, causing the female cultivator's plan to fail.</p><p>Qin Sang was present at the time and Master Huai Yin left a deep impression on him.</p><p>He guessed it was a rare body-cultivation technique.</p><p>"This technique can reverse life and death! Once I break through to the late fourth stage of *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, I will have time to cultivate the *Hou Tian Mu Ren Bei* using a seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo as a medium, obtaining a spirit wood body.  Combined with this technique, and my peak thunder escape technique, my body cultivation abilities will be quite formidable! I must visit the Western Lands someday to meet Master Huai Yin…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to miss any life-saving techniques.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang was also curious about the existence of any Immortal Palaces in the Western Lands.</p><p>The Cang Lang Sea has the Seven Killing Palace, the North Sea has the Zi Wei Palace, and the Central Plains has the Tian Tong and Tian Xiang Palaces. This shouldn't be a coincidence.</p><p>Each Immortal Palace hides a fragment of the Earth Slaughter Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang has long suspected that the hilt of the Earth Slaughter Sword is still out there, possibly unearthed by cultivators in the Western Lands, just like in the Central Plains.</p><p>Obtaining the complete Earth Slaughter Sword would help the sword spirit recover quickly.</p><p>A journey to the Western Lands is imperative!</p><p>"Right, there's also the poison pearl."</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness sank into his dantian and summoned the poison pearl.</p><p>A visible ball of white light, shaped like a cocoon, could be seen inside the poison pearl, vaguely showing the outline of the Jade Armored Insect.</p><p>Over a hundred years, the poison pearl has continuously and subtly devoured the Gu King's power, causing it to fade imperceptibly. The change is very obvious compared to before.</p><p>After achieving the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang can easily suppress the Gu King without relying on the Yun You Sword, so he no longer needs to be so cautious. It's time to let the poison pearl unleash its fangs and forcibly swallow the Gu King!</p><p>Swallowing the Gu King wasn't enough for Qin Sang.</p><p>The Gu King's poison, fused with the poison of a sacred object from the Wan Du Mountain, is extremely potent.</p><p>Thinking of the grotesque man's final fate, Qin Sang felt that without the poison pearl, he would have had to be cautious when facing such potent poison. Utilizing this poison to cultivate the *Tian Jue Dang Hun Shen Zhen* is also a powerful poison technique, capable of threatening even Nascent Soul-level beasts.</p><p>Besides his main body, there's also his avatar.</p><p>His second primordial spirit, imbued with the jade Buddha's Buddha light, has some resistance against the Heavenly Dao demonic sound. Qin Sang is considering how to help his avatar break through.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang carefully reviewed his path of cultivation.</p><p>His future path is clear.</p><p>By advancing his spirit, energy, and body together, using various divine abilities, secret techniques, and treasures, he can achieve immense power without necessarily needing to break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Apart from *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, there are no bottlenecks. He just needs to travel from Wan Du Mountain to the Western Lands, then to the Cang Lang Sea, and cultivate diligently for some time.</p><p>The problem is, does he have that much time?</p><p>These days, Qin Sang has adapted to the demonic sound's existence; he only finds it annoying.</p><p>He doesn't know if the demonic sound was always like this at the beginning or if it gradually intensified over time.</p><p>If it's only the demonic sound, he's not afraid; he can patiently focus on strengthening his own power.</p><p>But what if, one day, the world undergoes another change, no longer limited to the soul level? What then?</p><p>…</p><p>His external avatar entered the Central Plains and went to the Gan Lu Chan Yuan.</p><p>The monks at the Gan Lu Chan Yuan are already used to Qingfeng Daozhang's visits. The attendant monk didn't even report to the higher-ups, casually greeting him and letting him come and go as he pleased.</p><p>His cave dwelling is still preserved.</p><p>The avatar was familiar with the place and walked through the halls and alleys towards the back mountain. He encountered several senior monks along the way, some of whom he had interacted with before, and could chat with them for a while.</p><p>Some even guided him.</p><p>Unfortunately, his mentality has changed.</p><p>Before, he wanted to build a good relationship with Buddhism.</p><p>After parting with a familiar monk, the avatar put away his smile, his gaze swept over the ancient temple hidden in the mist, and he sighed softly, walking to his cave dwelling, gazing at Xiao Fang Cun Mountain for a long time.</p>
