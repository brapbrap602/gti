<h1>Chapter 2151: Yuanqiao Market</h1><p>Qin Sang read the message talisman, then flicked his finger, sending a streak of light flying towards a cave dwelling on the back mountain.</p><p>A moment later, Su Nu arrived, her figure drifting like a feather.  “Is the Sacred Ground about to open?” she asked in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang handed the message talisman to Su Nu. “The Zhuyan Clan just sent word. The Yi Ren Clan has discovered several clear signs. The next ebb of the polluted qi will be a great tide!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect it to be so soon!” Su Nu’s beautiful eyes flickered. She knew Qin Sang was going to enter the Sacred Ground, leaving her to look after Qingyang Zhi.</p><p>“I wonder how your preparations are coming along, Brother Qin?”</p><p>“Fortunately, I haven't slackened. I've already refined the Heaven-Trapping Golden Shackles,” Qin Sang said. “The Yuanqiao Market will be a gathering of Yi Ren Clan experts, also a good opportunity for exchange. If you need any spiritual materials for your cultivation, you might be able to find them there.”</p><p>“Alright. As long as it doesn’t interfere with Brother Qin’s important matters, just call for me before you depart. I'd like to broaden my horizons!”</p><p>Su Nu took this opportunity to discuss the Dao with Qin Sang before returning to her secluded cultivation.</p><p>…</p><p>Eighteen years later. Over a hundred years had passed since the great war.</p><p>Spring was warm and the sun shone brightly.</p><p>The grass grew tall and orioles sang.</p><p>A white cloud floated above Qingyang Guan. Yu Nu and Li Yufu stood on the cloud, their expressions respectful, as if waiting for someone.</p><p>A moment later, a figure suddenly appeared before them. It was Qin Sang. They immediately bowed.</p><p>“Reporting to Martial Uncle, the River of Misfortune began to recede this morning,” Li Yufu said.</p><p>“What does the great tide look like?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Cang Langjing sent word that the great tide has just begun. The polluted qi seems to be sucked in by a powerful force.  In an instant, the source of Azure Spirit Qi was exposed. Even the furthest extent of previous ebbs didn’t reach this far!” Li Yufu exclaimed.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. With the tide receding, it was time for them to depart.</p><p>The Yuanqiao Market was about to open. Although juniors were allowed to accompany them, it was still within the Yi Ren Clan's territory. Qin Sang decided to only bring Li Yufu and Yu Nu.</p><p>He turned his gaze towards the back mountain of the main peak. A moment later, a crimson streak of light flew out. It was the Vermilion Bird. Immediately afterwards, Su Nu also emerged from her cave dwelling, quietly arriving on the cloud.</p><p>Everyone was assembled. The white cloud drifted out of the mountain gate, disappearing into the horizon in an instant.</p><p>Traveling swiftly without pause, Qin Sang and the others arrived at the Zhuyan Clan. They didn't go directly to visit Clan Leader Yuan Xiang, but first sought out Yuan Miao, with whom they were most familiar, to inquire about the situation.</p><p>Seeing Yuan Miao’s beaming face, Qin Sang’s heart stirred, guessing the reason. “Fellow Daoist, you also obtained the qualification to enter the Sacred Ground?”</p><p>Yuan Miao laughed heartily. “Thanks to several sparring sessions with Realist Qin, and using Realist Qin's hand to find the flaws in my own abilities, my strength has greatly increased. I beat those old fogies to the ground, and was selected by the Clan Leader.”</p><p>Qin Sang was also quite pleased to hear this. Having another acquaintance in the Sacred Ground was always a good thing, although they might not necessarily encounter each other.</p><p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, Qin Sang and the others stayed in Yuan Miao’s cave dwelling, waiting for the Zhuyan Clan to activate the Shifting Formation.</p><p>Three days later, at dawn, Yuan Miao received a message.  Everyone immediately set off, heading straight for the Zhuyan Clan's Shifting Hall.  As they approached the hall, Qin Sang saw Clan Leader Yuan Xiang standing in front of it from afar, surrounded by a dozen figures.</p><p>These figures were either leaning against stone pillars with their arms crossed, or sitting cross-legged cultivating, all Zhuyan Clan experts. Each possessed a powerful physique, their qi and blood incredibly vigorous. Their gazes were sharp, carrying a fierce air, clearly all seasoned, top-tier experts.</p><p>Almost all of them were cultivating with their eyes closed, seizing every moment.</p><p>Sensing the arrival of Qin Sang and the others, they all looked up. Their gazes carried a powerful oppressive force. Those with weaker willpower might be scared witless just by being stared at by these eyes.</p><p>The smile on Su Nu’s face faded slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang acted in time, shielding Li Yufu and Yu Nu.  His expression remained unchanged as he landed in front of the hall with Yuan Miao.</p><p>Most of the Zhuyan Clan experts were focused on their cultivation, oblivious to the outside world, and unaware of Qin Sang's origins.  Some simply closed their eyes again to cultivate, while others noticed that Qin Sang and his companions were outsiders, glancing at them twice but remaining silent.  The silence in front of the hall was somewhat oppressive.</p><p>“Greetings, Clan Leader Yuan Xiang,” Qin Sang bowed, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. He had expected to see a grand spectacle of at least dozens of Void Refinement experts gathered, but there were only a dozen or so.</p><p>The Yuanqiao Market didn’t have a limit on the number of attendees. Any cultivator at the Void Refinement stage could go. The Zhuyan Clan definitely had more than these few.  Moreover, among those present, only Clan Leader Yuan Xiang was a late-stage expert, and the Zhuyan Clan's upper echelon combat power shouldn't be inferior to the Si You Clan.</p><p>Clan Leader Yuan Xiang perceived Qin Sang’s confusion and explained, “The others are still in secluded cultivation. They will bring the juniors later.  The Beast-Taming experts will depart in a few days.  The beginning of the Yuanqiao Market is chaotic, not a good time to go.  We have a special task.”</p><p>It turned out that the Yuanqiao Market was located deep within the River of Misfortune, only revealed during the great ebb of the polluted qi.</p><p>During this period, the Yuanqiao Market was isolated, perpetually eroded by the polluted qi.  Its formations were in disarray from the onslaught, filled with decay.  Therefore, the upper clans needed to go first to restore the formations and the market's former appearance.</p><p>Before Clan Leader Yuan Xiang finished speaking, a white glow flew from the horizon, enveloping nearly ten figures within.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists from the Youying Clan have also arrived,” Clan Leader Yuan Xiang said with a smile.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to look, seeing this group led by a person in white robes. Their facial features were somewhat similar to the Zhuyan Clan, with silvery-white hair. Their auras and gazes were very gentle, quite approachable, unlike the sharpness and aggressiveness of the Zhuyan Clan that made people hesitant to approach.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang hadn’t directly interacted with the Youying Clan, but their reputation preceded them.</p><p>In the eyes of the Beast-Taming clans, the Youying Clan's status and prestige weren't much inferior to the Zhuyan Clan, and some even considered them another upper clan.  However, the feelings toward the Youying Clan were quite complex.</p><p>On the one hand, the Youying Clan was easier to approach and reason with than the Zhuyan Clan. When encountering difficulties, seeking their help usually yielded a response. On the other hand, offending the Youying Clan was far more dangerous than offending the Zhuyan Clan.</p><p>The Zhuyan Clan preferred to act directly, without involving the innocent. Sometimes, a fight could settle the matter.  But offending the Youying Clan, one might die without knowing how, and might even implicate their entire clan.</p><p>The existence of Qingyang Zhi was tacitly permitted by Clan Leader Yuan Xiang, but over time, they would inevitably interact with other clans. For the sake of Qingyang Zhi, Qin Sang didn’t want to offend an enemy like the Youying Clan.  He stood behind Clan Leader Yuan Xiang, smiling in welcome.</p><p>The Youying Clan experts also noticed Qin Sang. Some looked towards him, including the person in white robes.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed a peculiarity in the eyes of these Youying Clan experts, a golden light flashing within their pupils.  He couldn't help but recall the feeling of being observed during his first battle with Yuan Miao. Perhaps a Youying Clan expert had been nearby at that time.</p><p>"That Fellow Daoist Yuan is the Grand Elder of the Youying Clan, only three hundred years older than me," Yuan Miao transmitted his voice secretly, his tone full of envy and admiration.</p><p>The Zhuyan Clan admired strength, not jealousy.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly observed the person in white robes.  Yuan Miao was also considered a genius within the Zhuyan Clan. This person, only three hundred years older than Yuan Miao, could be considered of the same generation in the Zhuyan Clan.  Not only had he become a top expert comparable to late-stage Void Refinement, but he also held a high position, undoubtedly a genius among geniuses.</p><p>"Yuan Jian greets Clan Leader Yuan Xiang," the person in white robes landed in front of the hall, first greeting Clan Leader Yuan Xiang. Then, his gaze shifted to Qin Sang.</p><p>"You are both young talents. Realist Qin probably doesn't know Elder Yuan yet. Allow this old man to introduce you..."  Clan Leader Yuan Xiang pulled Qin Sang forward with a smile.</p><p>Yuan Jian smiled and cupped his hands. "Realist Qin may not recognize me, but I have long heard of Realist Qin's great name.  It is an honor to finally meet you!"</p><p>Qin Sang returned the greeting, saying he didn’t deserve such praise. Suddenly, a whisper-like voice echoed in his ear, "Be careful of this one after entering the Sacred Ground..."</p><p>The voice was barely audible, undetected by anyone present.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly startled, because he recognized the voice as belonging to Clan Leader Yuan Xiang.</p><p>He couldn't help but recall the person behind the scenes that Min Zhuo had mentioned. Was Clan Leader Yuan Xiang suggesting it was Yuan Jian?</p><p>It seemed the relationship between the Zhuyan Clan and the Youying Clan wasn’t as harmonious as it appeared on the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang’s doubts deepened. Why would this Youying Clan Grand Elder make so many arrangements targeting him?</p><p>Unfortunately, Clan Leader Yuan Xiang didn't elaborate, seemingly unwilling to say more.</p><p>Perhaps Clan Leader Yuan Xiang hadn’t obtained concrete evidence, or perhaps he didn’t want outsiders to know and exploit the rift between the two clans, Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Numerous thoughts flashed through his mind, but Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. Yuan Jian's face also showed no abnormality. The two sides acted as if they had known each other for a long time, very cordial. Other Youying Clan experts also came forward to chat with Su Nu, presenting a scene of harmony.</p><p>Not long after Yuan Jian and the others arrived, several more streaks of light flew in, all experts from the Beast-Taming Clans. Some brought their juniors, preparing to head to the Yuanqiao Market in advance.</p><p>Clan Leader Yuan Xiang occasionally looked up at the sky, calculating the time in his mind.  When the sun reached its zenith, he said, "The time has come. The market should have appeared. We should depart!"</p><p>With that, Clan Leader Yuan Xiang waved his sleeve, opening the Shifting Hall.  Everyone filed in.</p><p>The Shifting Formation activated, spiritual light enveloping everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang cast a spell to shield Li Yufu and Yu Nu from the effects of the shifting, then felt a squeezing force. After a moment of dizziness, his feet touched solid ground.</p><p>As their vision returned to normal, everyone was stunned by the scene before them.</p><p>They found themselves in a vast, ancient hall.  The doors were tightly shut, and the surroundings were silent, the outside world unseen. And within the darkness, a dozen or so eyeballs floated in mid-air, spaced apart.</p><p>These eyeballs were round and bulging, without bodies, existing independently in the world, pale and bloodless. Their edges had no flesh, only the center, less than a tenth of their surface, was pitch black, their pupils as small as pinpricks.</p><p>After Qin Sang and the others appeared, these eyeballs all ‘looked’ over, revealing strange expressions, clearly living beings.</p><p>This scene was too bizarre.  Li Yufu and Yu Nu felt their scalps tingle.</p><p>The next moment, the eyeballs flickered, and faint spiritual light emerged around them. This light gradually formed human-shaped outlines with heads and limbs, albeit with extremely strange appearances.</p><p>The foremost eyeball manifested an illusory human figure, which floated forward and bowed to Clan Leader Yuan Xiang, emitting a gentle and elegant female voice that sounded somewhat ethereal.</p><p>"Wei Yin greets Clan Leader Yuan Xiang."</p><p>Clan Leader Yuan Xiang composed his casual demeanor and returned the greeting solemnly.  "It has been many years.  Clan Leader Wei Yin, I trust you are well."</p><p>"They are members of the Yimu Clan..."  Qin Sang heard Yuan Miao's voice transmission, and information about this clan surfaced in his mind.</p><p>The Yimu Clan was also one of the Heavenly Upper Clans.  As their name suggested, there was a saying describing their appearance:  "A single eye resides in their face."  Their facial features were significantly different from humans, but their bodies and limbs were similar.</p><p>What was most unique were their divine abilities and cultivation methods. Unlike the Zhuyan Clan’s focus on body refinement, the Yimu Clan cultivated their Primordial Spirits. They could be considered Spirit Cultivators among the Yi Ren Clan.</p><p>Moreover, during their cultivation, the Yimu Clan's physical bodies would gradually degenerate, transforming into pure essence and qi, absorbed by their eye. The disappearance of the physical bodies of those present, leaving only an eyeball, indicated they had all reached a very high level of cultivation.</p><p>In contrast to their physical bodies, their Primordial Spirits would gradually grow stronger, which the Yimu Clan called Spirit Bodies.  If they didn't wish to manifest their Spirit Bodies, outsiders would only see an eyeball. Among humans, the Spirit Bodies of Void Refinement Spirit Cultivators were called Yang Spirits. Qin Sang had been fortunate enough to encounter one before.</p><p>Qin Sang had briefly traveled through several major states of the Great Zhou and found Spirit Cultivators even rarer than Body Refiners.  This path wasn't prevalent among humans. However, among the Yi Ren Clan, clans similar to the Yimu Clan were numerous.  Spirit Cultivators weren't uncommon, and many possessed strange and unpredictable divine abilities.</p><p>The one who greeted them was Wei Yin, the Clan Leader of the Yimu Clan.</p><p>Wei Yin had a gentle disposition, and judging by the voice, was female. The Yimu Clan had male and female distinctions when they possessed physical bodies.</p><p>She also exchanged greetings with Yuan Jian and Qin Sang, while discussing the Yuanqiao Market with Clan Leader Yuan Xiang, and drifted towards the hall's doors. Arriving at the entrance, she produced a treasured seal and pressed it against the door.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>Azure spiritual light shone, and the rust on the door's surface peeled away, revealing two emerald jade doors.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the power of formations being activated by the seal, then heard creaking sounds as the doors slowly opened to both sides.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gust of wind surged into the hall through the gap, revealing the scene outside.</p><p>The ancient hall they stood in was built on a floating island. The island wasn't large. Ten zhang outside the hall was a cliff, below which was a sea of black, tempestuous water.</p><p>Beyond the island, countless dark shadows floated in the void, each a floating island, stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>These islands varied in size and height, but all were barren, devoid of life.  It was evident that these islands once had buildings, but most had become ruins, a scene of desolation.  As they stepped out of the ancient hall, they discovered that while intact, it was also weathered and old, having endured long years of wear.</p><p>Despite their dilapidated state, the essence of these islands remained.  A formation force connected all the islands, perpetually existing, protecting this place.</p><p>The crowd's gazes passed over the islands, looking towards the horizon, where a black curtain obscured the sky.</p><p>Some islands were still shrouded by the black curtain, not yet revealed.</p><p>That was the polluted qi, transformed into a black tide, vast and boundless, displaying terrifying ferocity.  Each wave crashed down like the collapse of heaven and earth, causing the archipelago to tremble violently.  The formations seemed as if they might crumble at any moment, far more turbulent and terrifying than what Qin Sang had seen at the edge of the River of Misfortune.</p><p>Just then, they saw spiritual light flickering on distant islands. Other clans were arriving.</p>
