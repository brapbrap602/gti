<h1>Chapter 1482: After the Uproar</h1><p>This wasn't without gain; at least they now knew that Qingfeng Daozhang was remarkably skilled in both swordsmanship and body refinement.</p><p>However, the cost was rather high.</p><p>A bet is a bet!</p><p>Shang Lu accepted his defeat, too ashamed to retrieve his python flag.  He turned and flew off the arena, returning to his cloud bed.  His expression remained unchanged, ignoring the surrounding gazes. He sat down to regulate his breathing, not mentioning the three snow pythons.</p><p>Seeing the magnanimity of this Shang sect leader, Qin Sang was quite surprised and unceremoniously collected the demon core and the python flag into his Qianjun ring, regretting not capturing a snake alive.</p><p>Qin Sang rather admired him, if Shang Lu had truly fought for love.</p><p>After a minor incident.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Qin Sang and Liuli returned to the altar to continue the wedding ceremony.</p><p>They stood side-by-side, jointly receiving the heavenly fragrance from Shi Xue, facing the altar, and completed the three bows.</p><p>Thus, the wedding ceremony was nearing its end.</p><p>This was already a simplified version by Qin Sang and Liuli; many complicated rituals were omitted, otherwise it would have taken another half an hour.</p><p>Soon, disciples from the Listening Snow Tower brought fragrant spirit python meat.</p><p>Shi Xue led Qin Sang and Liuli to greet the guests, sharing wine and conversation.</p><p>Qin Sang made a lot of new acquaintances.</p><p>Some Xuan Tian Palace cultivators who hadn't reached the Yuan Ying stage were still confronting the demon army, and Tong Lingyu and others had to return to the front lines overnight.</p><p>However, even just the experts present constituted the strongest sect Qin Sang had ever seen in his cultivation journey.</p><p>While praising Liuli, the guests looked at Qin Sang with curiosity and scrutiny.</p><p>Shang Lu, disregarding his status as sect leader, created a scene at the wedding, only to lose out in the end.  This new groom clearly hadn't shown his full strength, but the extent of his hidden abilities remained unknown.</p><p>They suddenly realized something: in the entire Xuan Tian Palace, perhaps only the Palace Master and the Grand Elder who controlled the spiritual treasure could decisively defeat this couple.</p><p>The Listening Snow Tower, previously lacking top-tier experts and gradually declining, was now no longer to be underestimated.</p><p>Amidst the clinking of cups.</p><p>Qin Sang and others approached Luo Wan.</p><p>Luo Wan raised her cup in celebration, drinking it down in one gulp. Looking up at the sky, she smiled ambiguously.  “The night is deep, a rare good night. I wonder which cave dwelling Sect Leader Shi has prepared for my junior sister and her husband?”</p><p>She was puzzled.</p><p>During the duel, she hadn't sensed any fluctuations from the *Divine Maiden Heart Sutra* from Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>She wondered if they hadn't cultivated this technique or if they were holding back.</p><p>Shi Xue looked at the ground, pointing a finger.  "It's Mount Taisu, where Master cultivated."</p><p>Before her words finished, a group of disciples and flower sprites flew from a mountain peak near the main peak, circling the mountain and sprinkling rain.  The mountain's vegetation grew wildly, and flowers bloomed.</p><p>This peak, close to the main peak, was one of the best locations for the Listening Snow Tower's spiritual veins.</p><p>In an instant, the lower half of the mountain was covered in splendor, a breathtaking sight.</p><p>The summit remained snow-capped.</p><p>Jiang, the Palace Master, slowly walked over, smiling. “Let me also gift you a cave dwelling.”</p><p>He pressed his hand downwards.</p><p>A point of green light descended from the sky, landing on the summit.</p><p>The green light rapidly expanded, transforming into palaces and pavilions, perfectly fitted together.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli preferred quiet and simplicity, so the cave dwelling seemed rather plain, but it lacked nothing in function, complete with protective restrictions—a carefully prepared gift from the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>They could store it away and take it elsewhere at any time.</p><p>After the cave dwelling appeared.</p><p>Tong Lingyu approached, examining Qin Sang and Liuli with a beaming smile.  “You are both rising stars, with limitless futures. The sect must also show our appreciation…”</p><p>She brought out several small flags, waved her jade hand, and they transformed into streams of light, inserted into various parts of Mount Taisu. She handed them a jade tablet for controlling the formation.</p><p>“This is the Azure Cloud Stabilizing Sea Array.”</p><p>Looking down, everyone saw a sea of clouds swirling around Mount Taisu, ethereal as a fairyland—a truly mystical formation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli thanked them.</p><p>“Go, enjoy your night.”</p><p>The guests smiled, watching the newlyweds leave.</p><p>Boy and girl attendants carrying incense burners, leading the procession, escorted the couple to the cave dwelling before bowing and retiring.</p><p>Thus, the wedding ceremony concluded.</p><p>However, countless red wedding lanterns remained lit, burning until dawn, illuminating the ten directions throughout the night.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli entered the cave dwelling.</p><p>With the activation of the Azure Cloud Stabilizing Sea Array, its power covered Mount Taisu, blocking outside views. All the festivities were shut out.</p><p>The clamor subsided, leaving only tranquility.</p><p>They walked into the cave dwelling in silence, side by side, their shadows lengthening.</p><p>The cave dwelling was fully equipped with alchemy rooms, tool rooms, and everything else; even two large halls specifically designed for cultivation were present.</p><p>One on the left, one on the right, situated at opposite ends of the cave.</p><p>Their cultivation methods differed. Qin Sang was undemanding of his environment, but not so for Liuli.  Being too close might affect each other.</p><p>They reached the central corridor, stopped, exchanged a glance, and said nothing.</p><p>After a nod, they silently turned and walked to their respective sections of the cave, backs to each other, leaving behind two lonely figures.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon, the guests departed.</p><p>Tingxue Tower gradually fell silent, only the flickering lights interacting with the starry sky.</p><p>News of the grand wedding spread, becoming a favorite tale among the disciples of Tingxue Tower and even the Xuan Tian Palace, each dreaming of having such a wedding someday.</p><p>However, the memory of the wedding quickly faded from Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>He immediately sealed his cave dwelling, focusing on cultivation, helping Tianmu Die stabilize her realm, refining the lingering soul shadows from her externalized body, preparing for the opening of the Sacred Land in a year.</p><p>Time slipped away unnoticed.</p><p>Tianmu Die's cultivation stabilized.</p><p>Breaking through to a minor realm, she hadn't grasped new abilities, but her concealment, Tianmu vision, and Tianmu divine light had all improved.</p><p>Furthermore, the tribulation thunder she commanded became more intense, though still illusory, it was gradually approaching reality.</p><p>A long way remained before Tianmu Die could assist with tribulation crossing, and Qin Sang wasn't sure if he could get there, but he wouldn't give up hope.</p><p>Then, suddenly,</p><p>Qin Sang sensed his cave dwelling's restrictions being triggered, his first disturbance since declaring seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated: the Sacred Land opening was still two months away.</p><p>He stopped cultivating, opened the cave dwelling, and found Shi Xue.</p><p>Her face was grave.  “The Grand Elder sent a message.  Demon activity is increasing; another attack before the Sacred Land opens is likely.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. “The Sacred Land will be affected?”</p><p>Shi Xue nodded.  “The Sacred Land opening probably won’t be delayed;  the various branches have waited so long, they can’t wait any longer. But if war breaks out, at least half the Yuan Ying cultivators will need to remain outside. The Grand Elder is convening all branches to discuss this.”</p>
