<h1>**Chapter 216: Encounter**</h1><p>The Fire Jade Centipede is born in fire and is unafraid of it; it is extremely sensitive to spiritual objects with rich Fire Essence. The richer the Fire Essence is, the more excited the Fire Jade Centipede gets.</p><p>According to the illustrated book, this bizarre creature is extremely rare in the current cultivation world; it is even suspected to be extinct. Qin Sang wondered where Yin Xingge got it from; perhaps the Golden Core Master gave it to him.</p><p>After understanding the characteristics of the Fire Jade Centipede, Qin Sang finally realized that Yin Xingge originally wanted to use it to find the Dry Sun Crystal; who knew that what he dug out was the Demon Lord, and he lost his life.</p><p>It is easy to cultivate the Fire Jade Centipede, but it costs a lot. It requires fire spirit-rich objects like the Dry Sun Quartz, each of which is quite expensive.</p><p>Fortunately, the Fire Jade Centipede does not eat much. Qin Sang put several blocks of Dry Sun Quartz around it, which would be enough to feed it for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Fire Jade Centipede in his palm and cut off a small piece of Dry Sun Quartz, tossing it to the creature. At once, the Fire Jade Centipede wrapped itself around the quartz and gnawed on it noisily.</p><p>The ability of the Fire Jade Centipede is strange. Qin Sang intended to keep it for future use.</p><p>After the Fire Jade Centipede was full, Qin Sang put it back in the spirit beast pouch and opened the cave entrance. After greeting the guardian of the secret realm, he left the Heaven Crystal Secret Realm, preparing to take a tour himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are unknown in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Even day and night are often unclear.</p><p>Time flies like water.</p><p>Twenty years passed by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>An unnamed high mountain was home to an innumerable amount of Cloud Beasts.</p><p>When cultivators see such a scene, their first reaction would be to turn around and leave. At this moment, however, a figure hid in the jumble of rocks, staring at a deep cave at the foot of the mountain, unmoving.</p><p>Close to a thousand Cloud Beasts circled above the entrance, their deafening roars filling the air and making people anxious. Time slipped by, a whole incense stick passed, and the figure remained motionless.</p><p>Finally, a dozen or so Cloud Beasts seemed tired of flying, and they folded their wings and landed on the ground.</p><p>Suddenly, the figure stood up and silently retreated. After it stood up, its appearance could be seen clearly. Its figure was human-like, but its appearance was horrifying: blue-faced and toothy.</p><p>It was a zombie!</p><p>Hidden by the jumble of rocks, the Cloud Beasts circling above did not see its movements, but the ones that had landed on the ground noticed this “living thing.”</p><p>There was no aura of living beings on this “living thing,” so the Cloud Beasts did not go berserk. Instead, they curiously looked at it, probably considering it a moving stone.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Seeing that the Cloud Beasts did not take the bait, the zombie ruthlessly stomped on a stone under its feet, breaking it with a small cracking sound.</p><p>The Cloud Beasts were suddenly alerted. Two of them could not hold back and flew over to take a look. They were shortly followed by the other dozen or so Cloud Beasts.</p><p>Now that it had achieved its goal, the zombie immediately quickened its pace. It seemed to be very familiar with the area and moved swiftly, staying within the cover of the jumble of rocks, so the Cloud Beasts in the sky could not see it at all.</p><p>Finally, after leaving the foot of the mountain, the zombie no longer hid itself, and it turned and ran without caution. It enraged the dozen or so Cloud Beasts, who flapped their wings and aggressively gave chase.</p><p>The wilderness was boundless, devoid of places to hide. The zombie ran with all its might, but the Cloud Beasts were faster. The distance between them was quickly closing.</p><p>It did not take long for the Cloud Beasts to catch up to the zombie. Amidst angry shrieks, they descended from the sky, eager to use their sharp claws and beaks to tear this annoying creature to pieces.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as they were about to reach the zombie, demonic energy suddenly billowed from the barren land, and six gigantic ghost banners “grew” out of the ground, covering these Cloud Beasts within the array.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could tell that these ghost banners were not the same. Among them were four especially thick ones, their poles covered with densely packed sinister patterns that gave off a strange, dim glow. On the banners were countless evil ghost designs. The evil ghosts were packed together, ferociously lifelike and abnormally sinister.</p><p>They seemed to come from the darkest depths of Hell, as if they were about to break free from the banners at any moment.</p><p>Compared with these four ghost banners, the other two seemed much weaker and thinner.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Inky demonic energy instantly enveloped this area, blocking out the sun and the moon. Countless evil ghosts roared in the demonic energy and charged toward the Cloud Beasts inside.</p><p>Next to the array, a figure solidified from its original ethereal state; it was Qin Sang.</p><p>He waved and summoned the zombie, which he had used as bait, to his side, and calmly watched the situation inside the Ten Yama Array.</p><p>For the past twenty years, except for three assassin missions, he has basically stayed in the Tianjing Secret Realm and its vicinity, hunting Cloud Beasts to perceive the killing curses while cultivating at the same time.</p><p>He has done this alluring-kill hunting of Cloud Beasts hundreds of times, so he is very proficient.</p><p>Twenty years seemed to have left no obvious mark on him, and the biggest change was his demeanor had become more calm, steady and substantial.</p><p>Although he had yet broken through the middle stage of the Foundation period, Qin Sang was about to comprehend the second killing curse. Once the killing curse was comprehended, it was just a matter of accumulating enough spiritual power to break through to the middle stage of the Foundation period.</p><p>Observing the process in which the Ten King Yama Banners destroyed the Cloud Beasts, Qin Sang nodded secretly.</p><p>He had asked the black market to hunt for soul training magic weapons the whole time. The attached evil items that he had obtained from hunting Cloud Beasts for twenty years were basically replaced by magic weapons.</p><p>Although life was cramped, he could still manage to get by. He had successfully advanced the four Ten King Yama Banners to great success.</p><p>Even though only four had been upgraded, the power of the Ten King Yama Formation soared to the next level. Among the dozen or so Cloud Beasts, two were as powerful as the Foundation stage early period cultivator. When facing the strangulation of the great formation, they could only fight for their last breath.</p><p>Qin Sang was confident that if he setup the Ten King Yama Formation and combined it with other methods, even a Foundation stage middle period opponent would not be able to get any advantage from him.</p><p>Seeing that the Cloud Beasts were almost killed, Qin Sang withdrew his thoughts and with a movement of his mind the Ebony Sword pierced through the great formation, killing the Cloud Beasts, while Qin Sang quietly realized the true intentions of the killing curse.</p><p>Very quickly, all the Cloud Beasts were wiped out and Qin Sang repeated his old tricks, ordering the zombie to lure in the Cloud Beasts.</p><p>The Cloud Beasts hovering above the cave entrance were finally completely wiped out at midnight. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Qin Sang personally crept into the cave.</p><p>There was actually a small Huoyuan stone mine in the cave, which was discovered with the help of the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Huoyuan stone extracted fire essence, which could assist in refining pills. Although it was not as valuable as dry sun quartz, it was still very rare. Fortunately, with this mine, Qin Sang could support his cultivation consumption.</p><p>Qin Sang filled his mustard-seed bag with Huoyuan stones and attached evil items and set off overnight towards the Changyang Market Town.</p><p>…</p><p>Coming out from the small courtyard, Qin Sang sighed slightly. The number of magic weapons that the black market could collect was getting smaller and smaller. There was only one this time. To improve all six Ten King Yama Banners, it would take a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and walked to the Taichi Pill Pavilion branch. He was about to go in and sell the Huoyuan stone, when an old man with white hair suddenly came out of the shop.</p><p>Looking at the old man's face, Qin Sang felt a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>Next, a distant memory suddenly emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart shook violently!</p>
