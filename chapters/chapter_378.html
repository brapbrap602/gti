Chapter 371: Tracking


*Pfft!*

The ebony sword easily sliced off a thin layer of stone, proving far sharper than Kong Xin's blue light sword.

Kong Xin watched the ebony sword's impressive display, exclaiming, "What a magnificent sword!  Every magical artifact you possess is so powerful, I'm truly impressed!"

Qin Sang replied calmly, "I've simply been fortunate enough to acquire a few convenient artifacts.  Your praise is undeserved.  If we were to encounter such perilous situations several more times, even numerous artifacts wouldn't guarantee my safety.  What do you think?"

Qin Sang's words held a subtle warning.

Kong Xin chuckled nervously, swearing to the heavens, "Fellow cultivators, you've all seen it yourselves; the cave ahead is the exit, and we'll confirm it soon! I swear I have no intention of harming anyone. I only resorted to this strategy to avoid prematurely revealing our location, just in case.  If I lie, you are free to deal with me as you see fit! I swear, this is the only time, and it won't happen again!"

…

The ebony sword danced, slicing away countless stone chips.

Gradually, glittering points of light appeared on the stone wall – clusters of cold gold ore, embedded in an attractive, uneven pattern.

Qin Sang continued working, detaching each cold gold ore and placing it on the open ground in front of everyone.

Thanks to the ebony sword's sharpness, Qin Sang worked quickly.  In less than a quarter of an hour, he had completely cleared a layer of the stone wall.

At this point, the evil spirits were becoming increasingly aggressive, and although almost everyone had used their most powerful techniques, the situation wasn't yet critical. They still had some strength left and urged Qin Sang to continue.

Unexpectedly, when Qin Sang tried to dig deeper, he found only stone, no more cold gold ore.

Reluctantly, Qin Sang tried over ten more spots, driving the ebony sword several meters deep each time, only to confirm that there was indeed no more cold gold ore.

This vein only had one layer!

Disappointment washed over the group.

It wasn't the meager harvest – the amount of cold gold ore from this layer was already considerable.  Dividing it equally, everyone would receive a quantity the size of their head.  Refining it into cold gold would yield significant value.

However, it was far less than they expected, making it hard to be satisfied.

Kong Xin was the most disappointed.

The others were just incidental participants, so the discovery of the cold gold ore was an unexpected bonus, and they quickly recovered from their disappointment.


"People die for wealth, birds die for food.  Even if there's only one layer of ore, it's better than having everyone linger until they're exhausted and trapped by the evil spirits. Let's divide this and hurry on our way…"

The cultivator with the surname Bao said cheerfully, looking at the pile of cold gold ore, then at Kong Xin, "You said earlier that everyone present would share equally. You won't go back on your word, will you?"

Kong Xin adjusted his demeanor and forced a smile. "Of course not. However, I didn't contribute much effort; Qingfeng Daoist mined all this cold gold ore with his precious sword. We should ask for his opinion."

Qin Sang chuckled. "Without everyone's help in resisting the evil spirits, even my sharp sword wouldn't have been so effective. Let's just divide it equally."

However, during the distribution, the master and disciple pair claimed that the disciple was of low cultivation and wouldn't dare take a double share.

Seeing the master and disciple's modesty, no one objected. The cold gold ore was of consistent quality, and the group quickly divided it evenly before rushing towards the exit.


Outside the cave, layers upon layers of evil spirits filled the space; the entire cavern seemed to have transformed into a ghostly realm.

Working together, they fought their way out, narrowly escaping.

This time, Kong Xin wasn't lying; this cave wasn't a dead end. Whether it was the true exit remained to be seen.

While setting various restrictions to impede the pursuit of the evil spirits and killing those that caught up, they fought and retreated until they finally escaped.

"Whew!"

Everyone panted heavily, still shaken.

The evil spirits weren't powerful individually, but their sheer numbers were overwhelming; endless and inexhaustible. Fortunately, they had leveraged the terrain to their advantage and avoided being surrounded.

It was unimaginable how terrifying the scene must have been on the surface, with tens of thousands of evil spirits swarming across several mountain ranges.

Thinking back, the cultivator with the surname Bao's words were accurate.


If the ore vein had been larger, everyone would have been reluctant to leave, causing further delays until exhaustion set in.  The emergence of a powerful evil spirit could have resulted in casualties.

"Kong Daoist, lead the way! I hope you're not lying this time!" The woman in red glared at Kong Xin, her voice cold.


Others also unintentionally surrounded Kong Xin.

Kong Xin chuckled dryly, repeatedly saying, "How dare I! How dare I!  You'll all know the truth soon enough…"

Kong Xin walked ahead, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi remained in the rear.

Not far along, Qin Sang suddenly paused slightly, a playful expression appearing on her face.  Her gaze swept over the backs of Kong Xin and the others, before she pondered for a moment and then followed.

…

In the cavern.

The evil spirits, having lost their target, gradually calmed down and returned to the cavern. Some began to fight amongst themselves, others continued to wander aimlessly.

At this moment, a figure appeared out of thin air.  He glanced at the completely excavated cave, and let out a cold snort.

Using some unknown method, he didn't alarm the wandering evil spirits. However, he moved very cautiously, keeping close to the walls, ultimately following the direction in which the group had left.

This person didn't notice that within the blood miasma, a zombie was mixed in with a group of ghosts, seemingly out of place.  It watched him leave with its pitch-black eyes.

Zombies, like evil spirits, are inanimate.  Blending in with these unintelligent ghosts, as long as it doesn't attack, it won't be attacked.

This zombie was released by Qin Sang amidst the chaos of the evil spirit attack. Its purpose was to act as an early warning system. If there were any creatures in the depths of the cavern far stronger than the group, it could provide advance warning, allowing them to escape.

Later, she didn't have a chance to retrieve it before leaving, so it was left behind.

Just a zombie.  It wasn't as difficult to create as a煞尸 (sha shi -  note: left untranslated as there isn't a direct equivalent to convey the same meaning in English), its main use was as expendable scout.  Even losing it wouldn't be a pity.

Qin Sang hadn't expected such an unexpected gain.

By now, she was a considerable distance from the zombie, and her senses of it were very weak.  She could only vaguely sense, through the zombie, that an uninvited guest was trailing behind. She didn't know how strong this person was or their identity.

However, this person didn't dare to appear openly, resorting to such underhanded tactics.  Their cultivation likely wasn't very high.

Was it an accomplice?

Or a stranger who happened to be taking the same path?

Qin Sang walked last, silently observing the actions of those ahead.  She couldn't tell which person was suspicious.

Finding an opportunity, Qin Sang informed Yun Youzi about the tail.

Yun Youzi was also somewhat surprised.  He frowned, scrutinizing Kong Xin and the others, but couldn't find anything conclusive.
