<h1>Chapter 1866: The Sound of the Demonic Drum</h1><p>“What this humble Daoist has described is rather general and cannot fully encompass the Great Dao of the world, but some principles are interconnected. The subtle art of application lies within the heart, and requires fellow Daoist to comprehend it yourself…”</p><p>Realman Zuo concluded with these words, also a warning to Qin Sang that he could refer to them but not completely imitate them, otherwise, it would hinder his own Dao path, which would be detrimental.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, keeping Realman Zuo's reminder in his heart. At his level of cultivation, it was impossible not to understand this principle.</p><p>Straightening his robes, Qin Sang bowed deeply to Realman Zuo, who accepted it calmly.</p><p>Realman Zuo's actions could be considered a true transmission of the Dao.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the preciousness lay not only in clarifying the direction of his future cultivation but also in deepening his understanding of the Great Dao, benefiting him for life.</p><p>The Dao that Realman Zuo spoke of was partly a summary of his own experiences and partly derived from the Daoist lineage and scriptures. This included the explanation of the path of brute force, originating from the demon cultivators of this realm, rooted in Talismanic Dao.</p><p>But all Daos lead to the same destination.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*, absorbing the power of the stars to refine his body, having no connection to Talismanic Dao. However, like the demon cultivators of this realm, he could cultivate a Dharma Idol, which was clear proof.</p><p>Realman Zuo nodded slightly and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>The golden-armored warrior also closed its mouth, silently guarding in front of Realman Zuo, its eyes looking at Qin Sang, but without any gleam.</p><p>Clearly, Realman Zuo had withdrawn the divine spark within the golden-armored warrior, focusing on recuperating.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang didn't disturb Realman Zuo, slowly sitting down, his face still in contemplation.</p><p>What he was thinking about at this moment was the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*. He had previously felt that this cultivation method was extraordinary, but unexpectedly, he still underestimated it.</p><p>According to Realman Zuo, the Dharma Idol was the manifestation of the 'Outer Scenery'.  That he, at the Nascent Soul stage, could already manifest a Dharma Idol phantom was truly astonishing.</p><p>“It should also be related to the Azure Phoenix blood essence…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought inwardly.</p><p>The more he pondered Realman Zuo’s words, the more he felt the profoundness of the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*.</p><p>This method took the path of 'knowing what it is, then knowing why it is'. First, it allowed the cultivator to cultivate a Dharma Idol, and then to comprehend the Dharma Idol and grasp the Great Dao. This was obviously much easier than blindly groping in the dark.</p><p>The person who could create such a cultivation method must possess extremely high cultivation and a profound understanding of the Great Dao, to be able to take a commanding view and make light of heavy tasks.</p><p>This could be considered a true Dharma!</p><p>“It’s truly remarkable, but it’s a pity that I’m not a demon. This method is not compatible with humans,” Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>If he were a demon cultivator, this cultivation method alone would be sufficient!</p><p>For the rest of the time, Qin Sang was completely immersed in his thoughts, not even glancing at the treasures in front of him.</p><p>The Demon King's legacy, treasures rarely seen in the outside world, were actually left on the ground, untouched.</p><p>“Five Elements balance…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked inwards, his 'gaze' falling on the dantian Qi Sea, sensing the True Essence circulating through his meridians.</p><p>How could he achieve a balance of the Five Elements without any deficiencies?</p><p>He certainly wasn't balanced now.</p><p>The *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* had no attribute. At the beginning of his cultivation, Qin Sang chose the Ebony Sword, refining his True Essence into Wood Spiritual True Essence.</p><p>“Since it requires all Five Elements, I will simultaneously absorb the Five Elements spiritual Qi in the future, harmonizing the Five Elements within my body…”</p><p>Qin Sang stroked his chin, thinking to himself, "It will certainly be difficult at first. I must start with the Five Elements mutual generation and mutual overcoming. I don’t expect to truly achieve the Five Elements mutual generation, endlessly generating and flourishing, but at least they cannot conflict with each other, lest they destroy my foundation. It will likely be a painstaking process…”</p><p>He certainly couldn’t do this immediately. The most urgent task was to quickly increase his cultivation, at least until he broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage before attempting it. But it also couldn’t be too late, lest it be too difficult to change when he reached the peak of the Nascent Soul stage. He had to consider it carefully.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts continued to wander, "Can I use external objects, or even other cultivation methods and secret techniques?"</p><p>He thought of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, the Four-Winged Serpent Seal, the Five Elements Crown, and so on, but he had no clear ideas.</p><p>Just then, the golden-armored warrior's eyes flickered with golden light, and it said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist, have you made your choice?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled awake. He saw that Realman Zuo's complexion had become a bit more ruddy, showing obvious improvement. He was probably about to depart.</p><p>He quickly gathered his thoughts, looking down at the treasures on the ground.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang made his decision. With a flick of his sleeve, his True Essence swept up all the spiritual materials that could be, or were suspected to be able to be, used for refining tools.</p><p>He had figured it out. Instead of taking those treasures with unclear uses and unknown value, it was better to choose refining materials.</p><p>He still wanted to continue improving in the path of refining. These spiritual materials would definitely be useful.</p><p>In the future, when repairing the Taiyi Star Carriage, even if he couldn’t use them, he could exchange them for other spiritual materials.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't recognize all of these spiritual materials. Since they were collected by the Demon King, each one was invaluable.</p><p>Among the spiritual materials he recognized, there were three extremely rare items: a section of withered vine, a crystal stone with constantly shifting cloud patterns inside, and a very heavy piece of gold stone.</p><p>That crystal stone was called the Yama Diagram Primordial Crystal. Grand Master Gu had once lamented that it was something he longed for but couldn't obtain, something only Great Realmen had a chance of acquiring.</p><p>"It seems that Fellow Daoist is still interested in the path of refining. It’s a pity that this humble Daoist has limited knowledge in this area, only knowing a thing or two…"</p><p>Saying this, the golden-armored warrior looked at the spiritual materials enveloped by True Essence, pointing to a roll of swirling brocade, "This is Jade God Silk, not naturally formed, but woven from the silk spun by a rare jade silkworm, combined with the heart essence of the Ice God Birch. The refining method has been lost, and only a type of bird demon called the Birch-Dwelling Bird from the Ghost Fang Kingdom can reproduce it with its divine ability. It is extremely precious. Not only is it exquisitely beautiful, but it is also profoundly mystical, most suitable for refining protective robes. Many fellow Daoists desire a piece of Jade God Silk but cannot obtain it. That object, neither metal nor wood, is…"</p><p>The golden-armored warrior spoke rapidly, introducing some of the spiritual materials.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior, for your guidance," Qin Sang expressed his gratitude. Realman Zuo's casual words could save him a lot of trouble.</p><p>Realman Zuo smiled faintly, "Although these spiritual materials are precious, they are not as valuable as the four spiritual treasures. Leave me a few of those pills, and take the rest. Some are healing pills, unfortunately, most are not suitable for me, but you might need them later. There are also some that can temper the physique, not necessarily suitable for us humans, so use them with caution."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang looked at the small pile of jade bottles on the ground. He had already set his eyes on these pills, guessing that Realman Zuo didn't value them, so he wasn't in a hurry to take them first. Since Realman Zuo said so, he unceremoniously put them into the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Neither of them were stingy people, so the distribution went quickly. Qin Sang later received some more treasures, some of which even Realman Zuo couldn't recognize, reaping a bountiful harvest.</p><p>After a stick of incense.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of golden chains rattling rang out. The golden-armored warriors raised their arms, and the golden chains '嗖嗖嗖' wrapped around their arms.</p><p>Golden light radiated from the golden-armored warriors. When the golden light dissipated, they had transformed into golden granules the size of soybeans.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Realman Zuo collected all the golden granules into his sleeve, stood up, patted his Daoist robe, his expression returning to normal, and nodded to Qin Sang, "Fellow Daoist Qing Feng, it's time to depart. Do you need to make any further preparations?"</p><p>"No need."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, having recovered eight or nine tenths of his strength.</p><p>As for his injuries, he could only temporarily suppress them with pills. He believed Realman Zuo was the same.</p><p>Just then, another tremor came from the depths of the Ritual坛. The two stood side by side, gazing for a moment, then summoned their escaping lights and soared into the sky.</p><p>Realman Zuo was worried about the battle situation and his escaping speed was extremely fast, but Qin Sang was able to keep up.</p><p>At this time, Realman Liu, following Realman Zuo's instructions, was still anxiously waiting for Realman Zuo's return. Suddenly, he felt two powerful auras whistling past, one of which was Realman Zuo's. He hurriedly chased after them but only heard a command telling him to leave the Ritual坛.</p><p>Soon, the two had crossed the blue sea of light, but unfortunately, they didn't encounter Marquis Dingxiang and the other demons.</p><p>While flying, Qin Sang and Realman Zuo were also communicating secretly. First, Realman Zuo introduced Qin Sang to the key points of fighting in formations, as well as the divine abilities of the Great Realmen in the Ritual坛, to help him integrate into the Daoist Court.</p><p>Later, it was mostly Qin Sang asking Realman Zuo for guidance.</p><p>“May I ask Senior…” Qin Sang hesitated, “This junior once saw records in ancient texts, stating with certainty that the heavens and earth are vast, encompassing Great Thousands and Small Thousands. So is this world a Small Thousand World or a Great Thousand World?”</p><p>This question had troubled him for a long time.</p><p>After asking this question, Qin Sang noticed two gazes falling on him.</p><p>“Haha… Fellow Daoist Qing Feng also knows about the Great Thousands. This humble Daoist had the same question back then and once asked the True Monarchs. The True Monarch only answered with four words — A World of Its Own.”</p><p>“A World of Its Own?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. It sounded like a Small Thousand World, but there seemed to be another deeper meaning in the words.</p><p>Clearly, the Daoist Court and the True Monarchs were aware of the existence of Great Thousand Worlds, but they seemed to have no interest in them.</p><p>Realman Zuo didn't seem to fully understand either, and didn't offer further explanation, leaving Qin Sang to ponder for himself.</p><p>Passing through layers of illusions, the further they went, the more difficult it became. Realman Zuo, with his sharp spiritual sense and extraordinary methods, could always quickly discern the key points.</p><p>Later, they found markers left by Daoist Realmen, getting on the right path, and their speed increased.</p><p>Qin Sang was happy to conceal his abilities, lest he expose the fact that he had once explored this place deeply, which would be difficult to explain.</p><p>However, they were lagging behind too much, and it was impossible to reach the battlefield in a short time.</p><p>The tremors from the depths of the Ritual坛 became more frequent and intense, and Realman Zuo's expression couldn't hide his urgency.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>Suddenly, a tremor spread out, affecting the entire Ritual坛. The illusions where the two were located instantly descended into chaos.</p><p>This tremor was more violent than any before, comparable to the explosion of golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang became inwardly vigilant and was about to ask when, suddenly, he felt an inexplicable sense of foreboding.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang heard the sound of a drum.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The drum sound came from the depths of the Ritual坛. Despite the layers of illusions, the sound wasn’t muffled at all, but rather resonant and containing a strange power, echoing in his ears and heart, lingering for a long time.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang’s heart pounded heavily, and his blood surged throughout his body as if it was about to burst through the top of his head.</p><p>This was a feeling he had never experienced before.</p><p>The drum sound brought infinite shock!</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>His escaping light came to a sudden halt. Qin Sang turned to look at Realman Zuo with a serious expression.</p><p>Such might from so far away, was it the Divine Court, or some kind of supreme treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Realman Zuo had also stopped, staring intently at the source of the drum sound.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The second drum beat, even more powerful than the first!</p><p>“The Demonic Drum!”</p><p>Realman Zuo suddenly exclaimed in shock.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Ritual坛.</p><p>Ever since the Daoist Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom arrayed their troops here, the conflict within the Ritual坛 had been continuous, yet the outside remained relatively restrained.</p><p>The morale of the soldiers and generals gradually wore down during the standoff, and the atmosphere on the battlefield became oppressive.</p><p>Until the emergence of the Divine Court, the unusual phenomena were obscured by auspicious clouds, but the unique fluctuations couldn't be hidden from the Great Realmen and Demon Kings’ perception.</p><p>For a time, Great Realmen and Demon Kings appeared in the sky above the battlefield, restraining their cultivation as much as possible, still causing the celestial phenomena to continue.</p><p>Thunder rumbled through the mountains and fields.</p><p>Dark clouds and lightning flashed in the sky, and flying sand and rocks swirled on the ground.</p><p>Powerful figures could be vaguely seen within the clouds, arrayed in two camps like the formations below, facing each other across the air.</p><p>However, they were looking towards the Ritual坛, sensing the continuous tremors emanating from within, their expressions varying, their eyes gleaming.</p><p>‘Dong! Dong! Dong!’</p><p>War drums sounded on the battlefield, the drumbeats resounding.</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The soldiers and generals on both sides roared, their morale instantly roused, their eyes bloodshot, staring at the enemies before them, poised to pounce.</p><p>The atmosphere became even more tense, on the verge of exploding.</p><p>At this moment, a drumbeat distinct from the war drums reached the ears of all cultivators and demon cultivators.</p><p>The war drums abruptly fell silent.</p><p>The cultivators' breaths held, and all was silent.</p><p>Above the dark clouds, a Great Realman exclaimed in the same shock as Realman Zuo, “It's the Demonic Drum! These demons actually dared to bring the Demonic Drum into the Sinful Wasteland!”</p><p>The True Ones’ expressions changed drastically, and they abruptly looked towards the opposing Demon Kings, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>The Demon Kings opposite were also startled after hearing the drumbeat. They exchanged glances, then sensed the gazes of the True Ones, but burst into raucous laughter.</p><p>A tall, slender Demon King clad in black robes suppressed his laughter, his expression sinister as he stared at the True Ones, his voice raspy but carrying a chilling coldness that made hearts tremble: “You, listen to my command! If the Daoists dare to make any move, kill them!”</p><p>The command spread across the battlefield, sending all the demon cultivators into a near frenzy.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang and the Bewitching Orchid King were entangled, the experts of the Daoist Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom were rapidly rushing towards the Southern Heaven Gate.</p><p>Initially, they would seize opportunities to attack each other, but finding it ineffective, they later focused solely on flying.</p><p>The Daoist Realmen, with the old Daoist as their core, formed a battle formation, their auras merging into one. The Great Realmen even spared no expense in using several precious talismans.</p><p>The True Ones transformed into a rainbow of light, cutting through all obstacles in their path with unstoppable momentum.</p><p>In comparison, the Demon Kings’ movements were much more dramatic.</p><p>The Demon Kings chosen to enter the Ritual坛 were carefully selected, each cultivating a different Dao, encompassing all of Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements.</p><p>Most illusions were related to Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements. As they traveled, most of the time they could find a Demon King who, through their Dharma Idol, could invoke the power of the illusions, greatly increasing their strength and protecting everyone as they quickly passed through.</p><p>The other Demon Kings would also activate their Dharma Idols in coordination, their speed no slower than the Daoist Realmen.</p><p>As time went on, the Daoist side consumed more and more talismans. Fortunately, they were well-prepared and could still hold on.</p><p>The old Daoist’s expression was somewhat anxious.  Running neck and neck was clearly not a long-term solution. The further they traveled, the harder it would be for their fellow Daoists to catch up, and in the end, only they would be facing the enemy.</p><p>In this situation, he couldn't afford to overthink.</p><p>Finally, after a period of rapid flight, the imperial edict emitted a dazzling light, indicating they were getting closer and closer to the Divine Court.</p><p>The fluctuations of the Divine Court were still present. Even if they couldn't see the Southern Heaven Gate, they could lock onto the Divine Court's location through the imperial edict.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The water stretched to the sky, and the demons rode the water, arriving.</p><p>The water flow rapidly receded, leaving the demons where they were, excitedly staring at what lay ahead.</p><p>At the same time, whistling sounds came from behind. The white-clad Demon King turned around, snorted, and his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p>
