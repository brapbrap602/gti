<h1>Chapter 1876: Chongxuan Temple</h1><p>The White Tiger star煞 stretched its enormous body, its two massive forepaws almost touching the Yin-Yang diagram.  The collision hadn't even occurred, yet it already caused astonishing phenomena on the battlefield.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>As if a mighty fist had slammed into a lake, the water on the battlefield instantly dropped dramatically. The lake surface caved in, and a terrifying force spread outward from the center, causing the surrounding water to rise and erupt into a thousand-foot-high wave.  In the midst of the battle, the starry sky vanished, revealing a white tiger, its body shimmering like starlight, and a Yin-Yang symbol spinning and expanding rapidly.</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>A tiger's roar shook the heavens. Its two forepaws pierced the Yin-Yang diagram, coincidentally landing precisely on the boundary between Yin and Yang.  Any observer, even if they could see the tiger's form, would perceive it as a sword, a ferocious, murderous sword!</p><p>The Yin-Yang diagram hung in the void, appearing so thin, so fragile, as if a single poke would pierce it. How could it possibly withstand this attack? Even as the white tiger was about to tear through the diagram, the Swordmaster's tone remained calm and steady as he commented on the Seven Mansions Dividing Sword Formation.  He made no attempt to dodge, raising his right hand and drawing a circle in the air with his joined fingers.  Channeling his true energy into his fingers, he traced a perfect circle in the void, murmuring, "Yin-Yang Magic Sword!"</p><p>*Whizz!*</p><p>The black and white energies within the Yin-Yang diagram surged, retreating before being torn apart by the white tiger. As the diagram dissipated, the white tiger's ferocity met no resistance.  At that moment, one black and one white energy stream, emanating from the Yin-Yang diagram, rushed into the circle created by the Swordmaster's fingertips. In an instant, a magic sword materialized.  Half black and half white, its blade was purely and distinctly divided, like two halves joined together. Its shape was identical to the Wenshin Sword, which had vanished without a trace.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>Provoked by the white tiger's ferocity, the Yin-Yang Magic Sword released a fierce sword intent. Qin Sang stared at the sword, his heart filled with wonder. It was still the same sword, no longer than three feet, yet facing it now felt like confronting a thousand, even ten-thousand-foot-high divine sword! If the white tiger borrowed the power of the boundless stars, then this sword summoned the power of Heaven itself!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Yin-Yang Magic Sword vanished, and a beam of black and white light slashed out.  In an instant, the light and the white tiger's ferocity were within striking distance, the only things visible in the world; time seemed to freeze.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Two supremely powerful sword intents collided without flourish, instantly engulfing the battlefield in blinding light.  Within the light, one could vaguely discern starlight and the black and white energies, but neither the white tiger nor the Yin-Yang Magic Sword were clearly visible, nor were the Yunyou Sword and the Wenshin Sword.  Exceedingly sharp sword energy erupted, each strand possessing terrifying destructive power.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>*Splash… splash…*</p><p>The thousand-foot-high waves, before they could fall, were shattered by the chaotic sword energy. Water droplets danced in the air. At high noon, the sunlight, previously blocked by the starry sky, now shone down, scattering off the water droplets to create a rainbow bridge spanning the battlefield. The glistening water droplets added an unusual beauty to the scene of carnage.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beneath the rainbow bridge, his gaze hardening.  His thoughts shifted, and his sword technique changed.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A clear, ringing sound of clashing swords echoed from within the sword light, followed by a figure being sent flying backward—the Swordmaster.  While the Swordmaster had shown no sign of retreat during the collision of the Yin-Yang Magic Sword and the white tiger's ferocity, now he was steadily retreating.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>Another clang of swords. Before the Swordmaster, two sword shadows crossed. The Yin-Yang Magic Sword and the white tiger's ferocity vanished together. The Wenshin Sword reappeared, hovering before the Swordmaster, blocking the sudden appearance of the Yunyou Sword.  Qin Sang's figure materialized following the Yunyou Sword, but this Qin Sang seemed unreal, his form ethereal—not his true body, but a sword spirit. The spirit's attack failed, its form dissipating like a bubble into nothingness, taking the Yunyou Sword with it.  </p><p>But the Swordmaster's expression remained serious; he continued to retreat, the Wenshin Sword flashing slightly, appearing on his left. Another sword spirit attacked, appearing without warning, as if born from nothing, or shot from the void, utterly unexpected.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>This strangely unpredictable strike still failed to break through the Wenshin Sword.</p><p>*Clang! Clang! Clang…*</p><p>The sounds of clashing swords merged into a continuous series, seven strikes in an instant; a violent storm of attacks could not describe the ferocity of Qin Sang's swordsmanship.</p><p>Qin Sang, having deeply understood the essence of swordsmanship from the Chengying Sword lineage, had been diligently integrating it into his practice.  For example, he’d incorporated sword techniques into the Seven Souls Sword Formation, creating many variations with significant success. These seven swords were incredibly elusive and unpredictable.</p><p>For any other mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, defending against these seven swords would be extremely difficult, especially after having just endured the impact of the White Tiger's ferocious energy.</p><p>Yet, the Sword Master, though forced to retreat repeatedly and appearing somewhat rushed, consistently blocked these seven swords with his flickering Ask Heart Sword!</p><p>However, the seven consecutive sword strikes weren't Qin Sang's ultimate technique!</p><p>"Watch out, friend!" Qin Sang shouted.</p><p>The next moment, seven sword spirits appeared above the Sword Master's head, simultaneously confronting his Divine Sword.</p><p>A single sword descended, its killing intent filling the air!</p><p>The Sword Master's performance had instilled absolute confidence in Qin Sang, so he attacked without reservation. This allowed him to better utilize the Sword Master to test his own swordsmanship.</p><p>"Such intense killing intent!"</p><p>The Sword Master's expression turned grave.  He sensed the danger before the sword momentum fully formed and increased his retreat speed dramatically, nearly reaching the edge of the battlefield.</p><p>As he retreated, the Sword Master’s fingers moved like spinning wheels, rapidly changing hand seals, before finally shouting:</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>He suddenly struck out with a palm, striking the hilt of the Ask Heart Sword.</p><p>The Ask Heart Sword violently trembled, radiating a brilliant light. Its body became as transparent as crystal, or perhaps it had become pure sword light.</p><p>Instantly, a beam of light soared heavenward. This light wasn't as sharp and flamboyant as typical sword light; it appeared somewhat gentle, yet incredibly stunning.</p><p>In comparison, the Yunyou Sword, while powerful, felt lacking in depth.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened, captivated by the light, his gaze fixed.</p><p>At that moment, he seemed to be mesmerized, forgetting his own swords, completely engrossed in that beam of light.</p><p>At this point, victory or defeat was inconsequential.</p><p>…</p><p>"The sword formation…it seems you've made your choice, friend."</p><p>The Sword Master’s voice sounded nearby.</p><p>At some point, the Sword Master had moved to Qin Sang's side. Sword energy still raged across the battlefield, stirring the wind and clouds, but both had sheathed their swords, and the chaos was gradually subsiding.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He knew he couldn't hide it from the Sword Master. He had indeed chosen the path of sword formations. While he had incorporated the killing swordsmanship gleaned from the Chengying Sword lineage, it wasn't as pure as a true killer sword cultivator's.</p><p>This choice was the result of Qin Sang's careful consideration.</p><p>He cultivated a killing-intent based cultivation technique, and logically, cultivating a killing sword should have been easier. But as his cultivation improved, Qin Sang realized that the killing intent in the "Cultivating the Sword with the Yuan Shen" and the swordsmanship from the Chengying Sword lineage were completely different, and not the type of killing swordsmanship that most people understood.</p><p>Cultivating a killing sword again might conflict with his cultivation technique, Qin Sang wasn't sure, but it would undoubtedly consume a vast amount of mental energy and effort. Furthermore, he couldn't obtain a second Chengying Sword.</p><p>A sword formation, however, was readily available, with existing foundations. With future cultivation advancements, his understanding of the Seven Souls Killing Formation would deepen, complementing his cultivation technique.</p><p>Even if he later delved deeper into sword formations and learned others, there would be a clear path to follow, making it much simpler than independent comprehension.</p><p>The Sword Master’s encouragement had inspired Qin Sang to strive for greatness in swordsmanship, but he knew what he truly wanted and chose the path best suited for him.</p><p>"I recall you saying that sword formations are also a form of swordsmanship…" Qin Sang said.</p><p>As he spoke, he continued to observe the battlefield, watching the dissipating mist and receding waves.</p><p>In Qin Sang's pupils, the image of the clashing swords seemed to linger.</p><p>The outcome didn't concern Qin Sang; his own swordsmanship was fading, leaving only the Sword Master's beam of light.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly closed his eyes. That beam of light was deeply imprinted on his heart, lingering persistently, almost like a brand.</p><p>"Indeed!  When you have clarity of path, it's the genesis of your sword heart. As I said before, those who possess a sword heart, all their actions are the way of the sword!"</p><p>The Sword Master, noticing Qin Sang's unusual state, stood with his hands behind his back, and after saying this, he fell silent.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang opened his eyes, took a long breath, and bowed deeply to the Sword Master.</p><p>Observing Qin Sang's expression, the Sword Master said, "Your final sword strike was unparalleled, yet there was a sense of incompleteness.  When you reach the peak, let's spar again!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "This formation is vast and profound. Sometimes I think I've mastered it, but with each advancement in cultivation, I gain new insights."</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation did have flaws, not in the formation itself, but because Qin Sang's cultivation wasn't yet high enough.</p><p>Qin Sang tried his best to conceal his flaws.  His techniques shifted so rapidly during the sparring match that they were almost imperceptible, yet the Swordsman Master saw through them with just a few strokes of his sword.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised, though. This exchange had given him a profound understanding of the Swordsman Master's mastery of the sword.</p><p>The Swordsman Master's two reminders, and that final strike, were clearly meant as guidance.</p><p>Qin Sang felt no disappointment.  Swordsmanship wasn't his whole world, and being outmatched by the Swordsman Master was expected.</p><p>Still, Qin Sang hadn't anticipated such a vast difference in skill. He even wondered if he could defeat the Swordsman Master at his best.</p><p>"My business here is finished. I should return," the Swordsman Master said, sheathing his sword and taking to the air.</p><p>Qin Sang followed, using his own flight technique.</p><p>On the way back, Qin Sang was quiet, that final sword strike replaying endlessly in his mind.</p><p>Back at Sword Heart Island, Qin Sang was about to enter seclusion to process the battle when Jian Nu delivered a message scroll.</p><p>The scroll was from Master Gu, saying that Master Xun was at the White Stone Altar and requesting Qin Sang's immediate return.</p><p>This was also important and urgent, so Qin Sang bid farewell to the Swordsman Master and left Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Traveling west, Qin Sang gathered some information along the way.</p><p>Overall, the situation was much the same as five years ago.  The Daoist Court and the Gui Fang nation maintained heavy troops along the Yellow Springs Path, with constant skirmishes and casualties, but there was no sign of an all-out war yet.  Both sides were clearly preparing.</p><p>However, the atmosphere was growing tenser by the day, and all signs pointed towards an inevitable war—it was only a matter of time.</p><p>Master Gu, without delay, took Qin Sang to the altar to meet Master Xun, offering some advice along the way.</p><p>"Junior Disciples Gu Han and Qingfeng, pay our respects to Master Xun."</p><p>In a golden hall, Qin Sang and Master Gu bowed before a Daoist.</p><p>Master Xun wore a simple blue robe and cloud shoes. His demeanor was gentle, immediately conveying the air of a highly respected elder.</p><p>Facing Master Xun, Qin Sang felt as if he were before an ordinary person; the master's aura was incredibly subtle, making it impossible to discern his cultivation level.</p><p>However, Master Xun held the high rank of Third Grade Official, which spoke volumes.</p><p>Despite his high official rank, Master Xun preferred to be addressed as "Master," so that's how Qin Sang and Master Gu referred to him.</p><p>"No need for such formalities!"</p><p>Master Xun raised his hands slightly, showing no air of superiority, and smiled at Qin Sang. "Master Gu tells me Qingfeng Master possesses a treasure that could aid our Daoist sect in slaying demons and exorcising evil?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, immediately producing the war drum and presenting it with both hands. "Please, Master Xun, examine it."</p><p>Master Xun accepted the drum but didn't examine it immediately. He sent a talisman order outside the hall, then carefully studied the drum.</p><p>"It is indeed a treasure, but unfortunately..."</p><p>Master Xun's face showed regret.</p><p>All three understood his regret. Master Gu promptly said, "Daoist Friend Qingfeng has a plan for its repair. With further work by a master craftsman of the Daoist sect, it may yet be restored to its former glory."</p><p>As they spoke, a green light landed outside the hall, revealing a white-haired Daoist.</p><p>This Daoist seemed to be of very high standing. Upon entering the hall, he merely bowed slightly to Master Xun, who didn't seem to mind. He handed the war drum to the newcomer.</p><p>The Daoist examined it for a long time, his eyes gleaming.  Suddenly, he looked at Qin Sang and scrutinized him. "You wish to repair this treasure yourself?"</p><p>"I am aware of my own limitations, and I humbly request your guidance, Master," Qin Sang bowed deeply, speaking respectfully.</p><p>The Daoist and Master Xun exchanged glances, looking thoughtful. After a moment, the Daoist asked, "What kind of crafting technique do you wish to learn? Our Daoist sect has orthodox crafting techniques, and methods that use crafting to cultivate Dao; there are also more unorthodox methods, such as using treasures to craft limbs, replacing fragile flesh with sturdy materials, or completely merging one's spirit with an artifact, creating something like a spirit or puppet..."</p><p>The Daoist spoke at length, leaving Qin Sang alternately surprised and concerned.  Master Qi had once asked whether there was a Dao in the art of crafting; the Daoist was now outlining multiple paths.</p><p>"However," the Daoist said after his long explanation, changing his tone, "many of these lineages are incomplete, and some only have one or two remaining books; they might not even be Daoist lineages, and their origins are unknown. I cannot offer much guidance on these. You will need to explore them on your own."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Master Gu, didn't hesitate long, and said, "I wish to learn the orthodox crafting technique."</p><p>"Good, follow me!"</p><p>The Daoist tossed the war drum back to Qin Sang and left the hall. Qin Sang bowed to Master Xun and Master Gu, and quickly followed.</p><p>A green light enveloped the Daoist and Qin Sang, depositing them before a golden hall.</p><p>The door was unopened, but Qin Sang could already sense the pure fire within.</p><p>Inside the hall...</p><p>After testing Qin Sang's crafting skills, the Daoist produced several jade slips. "These are from the ancient Chongxuan Temple lineage. They should be the most suitable for you." </p>
