<h1>Chapter 1763: The Four Seasons Dream Flower</h1><p>Yu Yishi slipped between the two of them.</p><p>Yun Wei withdrew his magical power, a hint of displeasure in his expression, but he understood the meaning of accepting defeat. After returning the courtesy, he hesitated for a moment before saying, "I'm not exaggerating, this Demonic Curse of Soul Cleansing is a true, venomous secret technique passed down in my sect. Once the curse invades the five vital organs, there's no cure. Fellow Daoist, if you notice anything unusual after being afflicted by this curse, don't be reckless, and quickly find a way to counteract the poison."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly. This person was unexpectedly straightforward.  "Thank you for your reminder, Fellow Daoist. I will keep it in mind."</p><p>The Poison Pearl, capable of manipulating the primordial poison of five-transformation spirit insects, was unafraid of this measly Demonic Curse of Soul Cleansing. The moment the curse entered his body, it was completely absorbed by the Poison Pearl, without harming Qin Sang in the slightest.</p><p>Even without the Poison Pearl, Qin Sang, with his Spiritual Wood Body, possessed extraordinary resistance to potent poisons. Yun Wei's defeat was inevitable.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Yishi, who had remained taciturn until now, suddenly interjected, "I have personally witnessed Fellow Daoist Yun Shan using the Demonic Curse of Soul Cleansing.  It's difficult to judge its power at a glance, but it was far less sinister than the one you just used."</p><p>Yun Wei humbly replied, "Senior Brother Yun Shan's cultivation is far superior to mine. I merely obtained a fortunate opportunity."</p><p>"I hear that your sect recently discovered an ancient Daoist site in northern Jushan Prefecture, with extremely rich findings.  It seems the rumors were true," Yu Yishi said, looking deeply at him.</p><p>Yun Wei sighed, "We only obtained a few fragmentary scrolls, enough only to patch up our sect's legacy, but unable to break free from our ingrained limitations. When facing an opponent like Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, I was completely helpless."</p><p>With that, Yun Wei excused himself from Yu Yishi and said to Qin Sang, "Until we meet again." Then he strode away.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to their conversation, thinking, *It seems that the Lougu Mountain sect is skilled in poisonous spells and talismans.*</p><p>He thought of his Poison Pearl.</p><p>Usually, when facing enemies, he could only secretly release the potent poison from the Poison Pearl. Not only was it inefficient, but it was also easily detected by opponents, leading to failure. Now only the *Heavenly Annihilation Soul-Stirring Needle* technique allowed him to use the potent poison effectively, and there was still much potential to be explored.</p><p>In the future, if there is a chance, he should get in touch with the Lougu Mountain sect.</p><p>While pondering, Qin Sang followed Yu Yishi back to the main hall.</p><p>Yu Yishi mused, "Fellow Daoist is a cultivator of physical strength, this Daoist summons isn't quite suitable for you. But as we agreed beforehand, I won't stop you. Just be careful."</p><p>With that, Yu Yishi handed the summons to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, "Gathering herbs?"</p><p>It wasn't a mission to hunt down the demon marshal of Guifang, nor to carry out a secret mission for the Daoist Court.</p><p>Instead, the task was unexpectedly simple: to collect a single spiritual herb.</p><p>But simple didn't mean easy.</p><p>The herb, called the Four Seasons Dream Flower, was described in the summons as growing in a place called Gui Butterfly Mountain.</p><p>Gui Butterfly Mountain was a large mountain range within Jushan Prefecture, located on the eastern border, bordering Guifang.</p><p>The summons frankly stated that this area had been incorporated into Guifang's territory and granted to a demon marquis.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and asked, "Is this Four Seasons Dream Flower the prized possession of some powerful demon in Guifang?"</p><p>Stealing herbs from a demon's lair was undoubtedly a suicidal act.</p><p>"Gui Butterfly Mountain is located within the territory of a demon marquis, but it's quite remote, and this spiritual herb probably hasn't been discovered by the demons yet, otherwise it would have been picked already. After this herb matures, it moves within a certain range at four specific hours each day, making it elusive. In fact, we can't be certain whether the Four Seasons Dream Flower exists in Gui Butterfly Mountain; our deduction is based on certain clues. Fellow Daoist, upon arriving at Gui Butterfly Mountain, you must first confirm the existence of the flower. If it's impossible, don't force it. Bringing back definite clues will also earn you a suitable reward from Senior Lingxu…"</p><p>Yu Yishi first explained the characteristics of the Four Seasons Dream Flower and then gave him a jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained a route to Gui Butterfly Mountain, and even annotations of the demons nearby.</p><p>However, Yu Yishi stated beforehand that this topographical map wasn't recently drawn and the situation is constantly changing, so it cannot be considered completely reliable.</p><p>After a short while, Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>Yu Yishi watched Qin Sang's figure disappear outside the door before returning to the inner hall.</p><p>Outside the door, Qin Sang summoned a spirit beast, returned to his cave, displayed the summons, and took out the topographical map, pondering.</p><p>Over the years, he had been collecting information about Jushan Prefecture.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he would likely stay here for a long time because the two prefectures of the Daoist Court were not suitable for independent cultivators.</p><p>In the narrow sense, Jushan Prefecture refers to a long, east-west region centered on the area where the Daoist Court and Guifang were deployed in a military standoff. Jushan cultivators call this area the Yellow Springs Path.</p><p>This is, as the name suggests, the site of the most numerous battles between the two sides, once a scene of rivers of blood and mountains of corpses.</p><p>Crane鸣 Mountain lies within the Yellow Springs Path, the area where Qin Sang killed the tiger demon and Star Valley are considered to be on the northern and southern edges of the Yellow Springs Path respectively.</p><p>In reality, compared to the true extent of the  Gu Shan region, the Yellow Springs Path is not vast, only about two or three tenths the size of the Zhong Mao region.</p><p>The former Gu Shan region was the largest of the two regions and two mountains, reportedly larger than Zhong Mao and Bai Shi regions combined; the Yellow Springs Path seems to have been specifically designated as a battlefield for the Dao Court and Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>Both sides attempted to consolidate the Gu Shan region, advancing step by step to occupy the entire territory and threaten the enemy's heartland, but these attempts ultimately failed.  They couldn't withstand each other's counterattacks, gradually leading to the current situation.</p><p>North of the Yellow Springs Path lies a large expanse of unclaimed territory, where countless sects from the Gu Shan region are scattered, avoiding the battlefield and surviving in the gap between the two major powers.</p><p>Among the native sects of the Gu Shan region, Yin Tian Palace enjoys the highest reputation.  Very few sects, like Yin Tian Palace, dare to build their immortal city directly in the heart of the warzone.</p><p>Other sects regret that their mountain gates are not close enough to the battlefield; this is precisely what created the desolate area where Star Valley is located.</p><p>However, these sects cannot hope for peaceful cultivation.  There are many demon cultivators and traitors supported by Gui Fang Kingdom who constantly engage in open and covert conflicts.</p><p>The Gu Shan region is destined to be chaotic.</p><p>If Gui Die Mountain were located outside the Yellow Springs Path, things would be much simpler, but unfortunately, that is not the case.</p><p>For Qin Sang to reach Gui Die Mountain, the safest route is to circumvent it from either side, infiltrate Gui Fang Kingdom, and secretly approach Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>However, the further east he travels, the closer he gets to Gui Fang Kingdom, requiring increased caution.</p><p>"Fine, it will be a chance to experience the local customs of the Gu Shan region…"</p><p>Qin Sang, having made up his mind, muttered to himself.</p><p>The next morning, Qin Sang left Crane鸣 Mountain and set off alone.</p><p>He did not follow the route planned for him; upon leaving the city, he headed straight north. On the way, he remembered Star Valley and went to take a look.  Star Valley remained undamaged, and the Daoist was gone.</p><p>The Daoist's token was still in his possession, but Qin Sang was not in a hurry to use this favor.</p><p>Continuing north from Star Valley, Qin Sang encountered few cultivators along the way.</p><p>This area is too close to the Gui Fang Kingdom's main camp, and traces of demons are frequently found.  Cultivators from the Gu Shan region, when heading south towards Crane鸣 Mountain, deliberately detour westward; few dare to pass directly through here.</p><p>After crossing the vast mountain range, when Qin Sang again reached human territory, he encountered a different kind of commoner.</p><p>They do not live as destitute and savage as the Gui people, but neither can they live as peacefully as the people under the Dao Court's rule; they exist between the Gui people and normal people.</p><p>Cultivators from the Gu Shan region also educate these commoners, treating them as a resource for their sects; however, unlike the Dao Court, they cannot completely expel the six celestial evils from these people. As they age, these commoners gradually transform into Gui people.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's investigation, the biggest difference here compared to the Dao Court's territory is the lack of farmland.</p><p>The unique environment of this world creates various bizarre phenomena, each bringing Qin Sang new and curious experiences.</p><p>Incidentally, he also became curious about Gui Fang Kingdom, wondering how this kingdom of demons and ghosts created its demons and rivaled the Dao Court.</p><p>He did not venture too far north, but turned east, traveling at a brisk pace with few stops.</p><p>The further east he went, the more demons he encountered, from human-demon coexistence to the appearance of large and small demon kingdoms.</p><p>To avoid revealing his identity, Qin Sang used the Heavenly Demon Transformation, growing wings and emanating a demonic aura even purer than that of a demon cultivator.</p><p>His confidence in completing this mission stemmed from the Heavenly Demon Transformation.  With this ability, he could openly travel through the demon kingdoms without fear of detection, even if he encountered demon cultivators of the same level.</p><p>After taking a large detour, bypassing the Gui Fang Kingdom's main camp and continuing eastward, he finally stopped at the border of a demon kingdom in the eastern part of the Gu Shan region after much traveling.</p><p>"Ten thousand li east of here should be Gui Die Mountain…"</p><p>Standing atop a stone mountain, Qin Sang gazed eastward, pondering for a while before using a spell to conceal his presence and energy, then quietly continued eastward.</p><p>As far as he knew, Gui Die Mountain was the territory of a demon marquis of Gui Fang Kingdom, whose title was Marquis Liu Hou.</p><p>All demon marquises of Gui Fang Kingdom possessed the strength of the Nascent Soul stage.  Qin Sang did not want to confront such a powerful being directly; fortunately, Gui Die Mountain was not in the heart of the Marquis Liu Hou's territory.</p><p>Having arrived here, he was essentially in the heart of Gui Fang Kingdom, and caution was paramount.</p><p>Danger was naturally present; without danger, how could he obtain the token of a master alchemist?</p><p>While traveling stealthily, Qin Sang did encounter patrolling demon soldiers, but their cultivation was low, making it impossible for them to detect his disguise.</p><p>Over a hundred firebirds, flying in formation, arrived from the distant mountains.  The flames on their feathers painted the sky red.</p><p>Two firebirds in the lead were noticeably larger. One had a broken tail.</p><p>The firebird with the broken tail surveyed the mountains below, yawned, and complained to the leader beside it, “Brother, we’ve flown three circles.  We should rest.  It’s the same every day, every year. I’ve counted every blade of grass on these mountains. When have we ever seen a single human soldier? This is the Lord's territory. Humans would have to break through our main camp before they could reach here.”</p><p>The firebird leader chirped, and the flock, flapping their wings, extinguished their fiery feathers and landed, each finding a place to rest.</p><p>The firebird with the broken tail wrapped its body in its wings, settled into a sheltered mountain hollow, and lay down comfortably.</p><p>Just as it was about to meditate, it felt a sudden wave of drowsiness and fell into a deep sleep. A figure appeared before it.</p><p>The newcomer cast a spell, awakening the firebird.</p><p>The firebird was still groggy, answering whatever the newcomer asked.</p><p>The firebird leader stood guard on a high point. An hour passed, and he gave another command. After waiting a while, the firebird with the broken tail shakily flew up to rejoin the others, having no memory of what had transpired.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang withdrew his gaze.</p><p>Over the next few days, he repeated this process, using these demonic guards to gather information, verifying it with the contents of the decree, and investigating the forces in and around Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>This was still some distance from the Demon Marquis's mansion.</p><p>Qin Sang's concern was the Demon Generals cultivating nearby.</p><p>Previously, there was only one Demon General near Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>Now, the Gui Die mountain range was divided in two, each becoming the territory of a Demon General – one a Red-tailed Demon General, the other a Shadow-obscuring Demon General, each commanding countless demonic soldiers. The difficulty had increased considerably.</p><p>Due to the nature of the Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower, harvesting it might disturb the local earth energy.</p><p>The decree offered solutions, but these couldn't completely eliminate the disturbance, nor could they perfectly conceal it.</p><p>Qin Sang had to leave before the Demon Generals noticed.  If exposed, he would have to kill both Demon Generals swiftly and escape the Gui Fang kingdom before alarming the Marquis.</p><p>He quietly approached Gui Die Mountain, mentally rehearsing his plan.</p><p>Soon, he reached the edge of Gui Die Mountain.</p><p>Gui Die Mountain wasn't just one or a few peaks; it was an entire mountain range running north to south, a natural barrier protecting the Demon Marquis's mansion at the heart of his territory.</p><p>After traveling along the mountain range for some time, Qin Sang chose a hidden spot to stop and reread the decree.</p><p>His next task was to determine if Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flowers were nearby. The decree described three methods.</p><p>The first was too noisy to consider.</p><p>The second involved a special incense.  At midnight, it would be lit, and any unusual changes in the smoke indicated the flower's presence.</p><p>However, this method had a drawback: the older and more potent the flower, the better it could conceal itself, potentially rendering the incense ineffective.</p><p>The incense had been given to him with the decree.</p><p>Qin Sang checked the time and entered a meditative state.</p><p>The moon rose and set.</p><p>Finally, at midnight, Qin Sang awoke, flipped his palm, revealing a piece of golden incense.  He touched it, and smoke began to rise.</p><p>Strangely, the smoke didn't dissipate but circled the incense, gradually forming a cloud.  This meant the incense hadn't sensed the flower.  Qin Sang waited for a while before leaving with the incense to try another location.</p><p>Midnight was almost over, so Qin Sang extinguished the incense; due to the flower's nature, the incense was only effective at midnight.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang spent his days cultivating and his nights burning incense, searching around the Gui Die Mountain range.</p><p>However, after circling the entire range, the incense smoke showed no change.</p><p>"I have to use the third method,"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, putting away the remaining incense.</p><p>The third method was a herb-finding technique, but it would greatly deplete his spiritual energy. Though reluctant, he had no other choice.</p><p>Under the night sky, Qin Sang returned to the middle section of the Gui Die Mountain range, to a cave he had selected.</p><p>Sealing the cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged. The technique flowed through his mind, drawing on his spiritual energy as he silently activated it.</p><p>Following the technique's instructions, Qin Sang performed it every hour. As days passed and the repetitions increased, his perception, guided by the technique, seemed to seep into the rocks, unknowingly connecting with the mountains, plants, and earth energy.</p><p>Long silence reigned.</p><p>After an unknown period, in the dark cave, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, a hint of joy in them.</p><p>Found it!</p><p>(End)</p>
