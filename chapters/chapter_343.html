<h1>Chapter 336 Shi Hong</h1><p>“You all met the Ghost Yin Sect's requirement, breaking through to the sixth level of Qi Refining. The sect rewards promised to you were distributed. From Yue Wu, I learned that Brother Qin, you were sent out to be an outer sect steward, and Senior Sister Shi Hong was taken as a disciple by Yue Wu. Both of you were given important positions.</p><p>Tan Jie thought he might be overthinking things, so he focused on his cultivation. But as his cultivation grew higher, Tan Jie felt something was amiss. At the same time, we noticed more and more oddities.</p><p>Brother Qin, you never came back. Everyone who went out with you, all of you vanished without a trace!</p><p>Senior Sister Shi Hong was kept under increasingly tighter control by Yue Wu, losing her freedom!</p><p>Those senior brothers and sisters, after reaching the tenth level of Qi Refining, would disappear!</p><p>The entire Yin Sha Abyss was like a giant cage, and we were the livestock raised inside. People died every day, their bodies thrown into the abyss!</p><p>A constant stream!</p><p>Everything about the Ghost Yin Sect was abnormal.</p><p>At that time, Tan Jie and I had already started thinking about escaping. We tried to contact Senior Sister Shi Hong, but she was guarded so closely that there was no opportunity.</p><p>This made us even more uneasy. We tried to escape countless times, but never had the chance.</p><p>Until later, when the situation changed abruptly. The Sect Master's attack on the Yuan Zhao Sect failed, and almost all the experts of the Ghost Yin Sect perished in the battle. Only a few remained.</p><p>When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter. The guards of the Yin Sha Abyss either fled or dispersed. Yue Wu also died. Tan Jie and I took advantage of the chaos to escape, but unexpectedly, when we went to find Senior Sister Shi Hong, we ran into Liang Yan.</p><p>He not only controlled Senior Sister Shi Hong but also wanted to control us.</p><p>Naturally, we wouldn't let him have his way. After a fierce battle, Tan Jie and I were seriously injured and escaped, but Senior Sister Shi Hong couldn't escape his clutches.</p><p>We fled south, returning to our hometown, near the You Shan Market.</p><p>Because we didn't know how to contact you, we had to leave you a letter with the gatekeeper at the You Shan Market, using a secret code to warn you about the Yama Banner.</p><p>That person had a photographic memory. If you ever returned to the You Shan Market, you should be able to get the letter…”</p><p>Tan Hao looked at Qin Sang questioningly.</p><p>"Letter?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned, slowly shaking his head.</p><p>Back then, he had stolen the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid and fled in a hurry. He didn't dare enter the You Shan Market when he passed by, missing the opportunity to reunite with the Tan brothers.</p><p>Later, he joined Mount Shaohua and devoted himself to cultivation, not daring to relax for a moment. Let alone the You Shan Market, he hadn't even returned to the Great Sui Kingdom for a single glance.</p><p>“I was afraid that remnants of the Ghost Yin Sect were still active in the You Shan Market, so I didn’t dare to go back… Since you two escaped, Tan Jie must have given up on the Yama Banner and started cultivating again from scratch, right?”</p><p>Tan Hao lowered his eyes, a flicker of sorrow flashing through them. His voice was unusually low as he said, “He didn't have the chance to start over… When we escaped the Ghost Yin Sect, we first encountered Liang Yan, then were pursued. Tan Jie’s cultivation was higher, so I had to rely on him, which resulted in him being severely injured. He couldn’t suppress the evil spirits of the Yama Banner and was backlashed. Fortunately, he knew there was something wrong with the Yama Banner early on and took precautions, preventing the evil spirits from succeeding. However, both his soul and body were severely injured, and no one in the You Shan Market could heal him. In order to find healing medicine for him, I had to come to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield…”</p><p>“The Tranquility Pill you bought at the secret market, it was for Tan Jie, right?”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized, no wonder Tan Hao seemed healthy and not injured.</p><p>“Is Brother Tan Jie recovering in a cave? I’ll go with you, Brother Tan, to see him. If there’s a way to heal Brother Tan Jie’s injuries, I will certainly do my part.”</p><p>“Thank you, Brother Qin.”</p><p>Tan Hao gratefully cupped his hands in thanks, but his face held little joy.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently. Since Tan Hao hadn’t been able to heal Tan Jie for so many years, the injuries must be extremely serious.</p><p>However, Tan Hao was only at the Qi Refining stage and a rogue cultivator, with limited resources. He had to exhaust all his efforts just to buy a single Tranquility Pill.</p><p>Although Qin Sang didn't have much spiritual stone left, he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, backed by Mount Shaohua, and had a good relationship with Yun Youzi, a disciple of the Taiyi Pill Sect. He had many more options than Tan Hao.</p><p>If he could cure Tan Jie, Qin Sang would definitely not hesitate to help.</p><p>“By the way, Senior Sister Shi Hong was taken away by Liang Yan? Have you seen her since?”</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Shi Hong. Of the few who entered the Ghost Yin Sect together, only the four of them survived. Now that he had met the Tan brothers, there was still no news of Shi Hong.</p><p>Tan Hao hesitated for a moment, then said in a low voice, “After we parted at the Ghost Yin Sect, there was no news of Senior Sister Shi Hong.  It wasn’t until a few years ago that we unexpectedly met again at the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. “Senior Sister Shi Hong escaped Liang Yan’s control? How is she doing now?”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Tan Hao sighed deeply. “Senior Sister Shi Hong is still under Liang Yan’s control. Fortunately, she was warned by Tan Jie and knew that something was wrong with the Yama Banner. Her cultivation has remained at the bottleneck of the ninth level of Qi Refining. She pretends to be stuck at the bottleneck and hasn’t dared to break through.”</p><p>“Liang Yan isn’t dead?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank. The Ghost Yin Sect was destroyed, and almost all its cultivators were hunted down by the Yuan Zhao Sect. He hadn't expected Liang Yan to be so lucky, still alive and well.</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, his voice filled with hatred.</p><p>“Not only is he alive, he actually benefited from the disaster.</p><p>“According to Senior Sister Shi Hong, Liang Yan already styled himself as Yue Wu’s direct disciple when he was in the Ghost Yin Sect. When the upheaval occurred, he took Yue Wu’s inheritance.</p><p>“While fleeing, he encountered a severely injured Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Ghost Yin Sect. This person was skilled at deception, and after gaining the cultivator’s trust, he launched a sneak attack and killed him.</p><p>“Having obtained the inheritances of two Foundation Establishment cultivators, coupled with Liang Yan’s own talent, it didn't take long for him to successfully break through to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>“A few years ago, Senior Sister Shi Hong said he was close to breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment. I don’t know if he’s succeeded by now.”</p><p>“Foundation Establishment stage?”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, both for Liang Yan and for his fellow disciples.</p><p>Although Liang Yan was talented, if he had cultivated steadily in the Ghost Yin Sect, he wouldn't have broken through so quickly. It could only be said that everyone has their own destiny.</p><p>That battle was a catastrophe for the Ghost Yin Sect, but it was a great opportunity for Liang Yan. He lost the protection of his sect but gained the inheritance of two Foundation Establishment cultivators, making his cultivation resources even more abundant.</p><p>He himself was the same.</p><p>If it weren't for that battle, he would have stayed in the Ghost Yin Sect, successfully breaking through to the tenth level of Qi Refining, but hadn't died from the Yama’s devouring.  His abnormality would certainly have been discovered.</p><p>Not only would he have lost his life, but the Jade Buddha would have fallen into the hands of others, becoming someone else’s treasure. He wouldn’t have survived until now.</p><p>For Shi Hong, however, this experience was incredibly cruel, cutting off her path to immortality.</p><p>She possessed dual Gold and Wood spiritual roots, a talent second only to the heavenly gifted.</p><p>Looking at the entire cultivation world, she could be called a genius.</p><p>Even without joining a cultivation sect, Shi Hong had a good chance of breaking through to Foundation Establishment on her own, but due to mistakenly entering the demonic sect, she almost became the soul of a demonic weapon. Although she escaped that fate, she was trapped at the eighth level of Qi Refining, not daring to break through to this day.</p><p>It was truly lamentable.</p>
