<h1>Chapter 568: The Fiends and the Transmitted Voice</h1><p>True Unity Elder had long warned about the interdependence of allies, comparing them to lips and teeth. The Abyss of Sin was powerful, and the ambitious Old Devil Ye, if successful in destroying the Heavenly March Alliance, would surely turn his attention to the Minor Cold Region soon after.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators of the Minor Cold Region, upon hearing Patriarch Redhair's command, quickly grasped the gravity of the situation and decided to act accordingly.  Without retrieving their magical treasures, they immediately turned to rescue the beleaguered alliance.</p><p>The grudges between the two regions would be settled later; the immediate priority was to prevent the Abyss of Sin from annihilating the Heavenly March Alliance.</p><p>At this moment, the onslaught of the Abyss of Sin cultivators finally crashed down upon the Heavenly March Alliance.</p><p>A dark tide of fiends descended from the sky, engulfing them.</p><p>The hastily erected defenses were shattered like dry twigs.</p><p>Screams of agony pierced the air.</p><p>The Nascent Soul experts, so imposing just moments before, were now reduced to lambs awaiting slaughter, lost in the demonic tide, their lives hanging by a thread.</p><p>After this massacre, few were expected to survive.</p><p>As for the Golden Core cultivators, it was feared that none would remain.</p><p>‘Thud! Thud! Thud!…’</p><p>The reinforcements from the Minor Cold Region finally arrived, breaking through the demonic tide to rescue survivors.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other Golden Core cultivators of the Minor Cold Region were powerless to intervene in this battle, relegated to the role of spectators.</p><p>Everyone watched with trepidation, relieved only when their Nascent Soul cultivators acted swiftly, executing the traitor and foiling the Abyss of Sin's plot.  Even then, they remained tense, anxiously observing the unfolding situation.</p><p>Witnessing the devastation of the Heavenly March Alliance, a sense of shared vulnerability gripped them.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, felt a measure of reassurance. He alone knew that Chen Yan was a Nascent Soul expert.  Even if their side were defeated, with the Unpolar Sect Master's treachery exposed, escape should be possible.</p><p>He strained his eyes, peering into the chaotic scene where the Heavenly March Alliance cultivators were arrayed, barely able to discern anything clearly.</p><p>He saw a Heavenly March Alliance Nascent Soul cultivator, attempting to evade the demonic tide, inadvertently stray from the protection of the Minor North Star Formation. Before he could fly far, he vanished into thin air.</p><p>In the instant of his disappearance, an almost imperceptible ripple emanated from him.</p><p>“Void Winds!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face paled.</p><p>This cultivator was a genuine Nascent Soul expert, yet he was utterly defenseless against the Void Winds, erased from existence without a trace, not even his Nascent Soul escaping.</p><p>The power of the Void Winds was truly terrifying!</p><p>No wonder the Minor North Star Formation had nearly collapsed from a mere brush with them.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang saw a divine general, wielding a halberd, break through the demonic tide. His body was covered in wounds, not a single patch of skin left unscathed. A gaping, bloody hole pierced his abdomen.</p><p>His halberd was also broken and battered, its tip snapped off, its divine light dimmed.</p><p>Clearly, he had paid a heavy price to escape.</p><p>But as a flicker of relief crossed the general's face, countless fiends erupted from the demonic tide.  Unafraid of his attacks, they lunged ferociously, tearing and biting at his flesh.</p><p>Along with the fiends came countless grotesque chains, rising like venomous serpents and coiling around him.</p><p>The general struggled to defend himself, despair etched on his face.</p><p>The scene was gruesome and sickening.</p><p>Just as the general seemed about to be torn apart, he roared, striking the crown of his head.  A flash of azure light erupted from his Baihui acupoint, and his Nascent Soul leaped out.</p><p>The Nascent Soul clutched a cracked, grayish-white mirror to its chest.  Its eyes darted around, then without hesitation, it shot towards the Minor Cold Region’s side.</p><p>The moment the general's Nascent Soul appeared, the fiends reacted as if they had seen the most tempting delicacy, their ghostly eyes blazing crimson, emitting chilling shrieks as they pursued it relentlessly.</p><p>A terrifying spectacle that sent shivers down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>The general's Nascent Soul dodged repeatedly, its room to maneuver shrinking. Just as despair began to consume it, a jade ruyi flew towards it, scattering emerald light, smashing into the fiends and severing the chains, opening a path for the Nascent Soul.</p><p>It was Daoist Chong Yi who had intervened.</p><p>"Thank you, fellow Daoist, for saving my life," the general said, his voice trembling, cupping his hands in gratitude.</p><p>Daoist Chong Yi nodded, continuing to wield the jade ruyi, rescuing others.</p><p>The general retreated to a corner to heal.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, an isolated Nascent Soul would attract covetous gazes.  However, no one dared to make a move against him now.  They could only conceal their greed, stealing furtive glances.</p><p>One by one, the Heavenly March Alliance Nascent Souls were rescued.</p><p>Each one was in a sorry state, hardly any escaping unscathed.</p><p>As expected, the Golden Core cultivators had perished, their souls devoured by the fiends unleashed by the Abyss of Sin, their fate undoubtedly horrific.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of gratitude. It was fortunate that he and Wandering Scholar had stumbled upon the Abyss of Sin’s plot. Otherwise, they too might have met the same gruesome end as the Heavenly March Alliance’s Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Beneath the Six-Armed Fiend's shadow, a wizened, black-robed elder clutched a black stone sculpture.</p><p>The sculpture depicted the Six-Armed Ancient Fiend, its eyes eerily lifelike.</p><p>“Two old fools, consider yourselves lucky!” the elder cursed, his expression grim. While the surprise attack had been somewhat effective, it fell far short of their expectations.</p><p>At least, the chance to permanently eliminate their rivals from these two regions was lost.</p><p>Such a rare opportunity was unlikely to present itself again.</p><p>The elder felt a pang of regret.  After a moment's hesitation, he said in a deep voice, “Enough! The Ancient Fiend’s projection is nearing its limit.  Continuing this entanglement won't kill many more. Destroy their Minor North Star Formation!”</p><p>The cultivators under his command immediately obeyed.</p><p>The next moment, dense demonic energy surged from the Six-Armed Fiend, flowing into its six arms. It raised them in unison, like a massive hammer, and slammed down again upon the Minor North Star Formation.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Blow after blow.</p><p>The Six-Armed Fiend, reckless in its expenditure of essence, seemed to have gone mad.</p><p>The North Star within the formation dimmed with each strike.</p><p>Finally, with the last devastating blow, a corner of the star chart collapsed, and the North Star, now incredibly faint, was on the verge of extinguishing!</p><p>The Six-Armed Fiend, exhausted, swayed precariously.</p><p>The wizened elder swept his arm, "Retreat!"</p><p>The Abyss of Sin cultivators, disciplined and obedient, immediately withdrew their fiends and chains, retreating silently.</p><p>As the Abyss of Sin forces withdrew, a flicker of relief crossed the faces of the defenders.  But it was short-lived as they noticed a change in the Minor North Star Formation.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The collapse of the Minor North Star Formation was now unstoppable.  Patriarch Redhair and True Unity Elder, filled with alarm, poured all their energy into stabilizing the formation, shouting urgently, “Into the Violet Citadel!”</p><p>Within the immortal formation, without the protection of the Minor North Star Formation, they were doomed.</p><p>Old Devil Ye, even in retreat, had dealt them a final, devastating blow!</p><p>With no time to recover, they frantically urged their damaged spirit formations onward, racing against time.</p><p>As the formation crumbled, cultivators continued to be annihilated by the Void Winds.</p><p>Duke Dongyang struggled alone, and to protect Qin Sang and the others, Chen Yan could no longer conceal her strength, revealing her Nascent Soul cultivation.</p><p>Finally reaching the edge of the immortal formation, with the Minor North Star Formation in ruins, they couldn't regroup and could only drift with the currents.</p><p>Just as they were about to enter the Violet Citadel, Qin Sang heard Granny Jing's transmitted voice in his ear.</p>
