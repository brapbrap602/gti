<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1328: The Land of Filth</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Boyuan gathered together, and through Lu's introduction, they met several unfamiliar desert cultivators. Qing Jun stood nearby, intently observing the swirling mist vortex, deep in thought.</p><p>Five days passed in the blink of an eye. By then, no newcomers had appeared for some time. Qin Sang glanced casually at the cultivators from the Minor Cold Domain not far away. They were preparing to cooperate with Lord Tongyou and the demon race to investigate another forbidden area. When his gaze swept over Dongyang Bo, the latter seemed to sense it and raised his head, locking eyes with Qin Sang. As if knowing what Qin Sang was thinking, Dongyang Bo's lips curled into a playful smile. Qin Sang's expression turned cold, and he averted his gaze.</p><p>For the past twenty years, Dongyang Bo had been unusually quiet, seemingly forgetting the incident where Qin Sang had snatched his Nascent Soul puppet and severely injured him. Perhaps he was wary of Qin Sang's strength, fearing retaliation against Shaohua Mountain, and had chosen to swallow his pride and avoid further conflict. However, Qin Sang paid no mind to Dongyang Bo's thoughts. Dongyang Bo posed no threat to him. If Dongyang Bo dared to make a move, Bai and the Nascent Soul puppet Qin Sang had already subdued would surely give him a big surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts turned to another matter. Based on the information he had gathered and the words Dongyang Bo had spoken, it seemed that Chen Yan's last attempt to rescue her master had ended in failure. Back then, Qin Sang had sold himself to achieve Foundation Establishment, but Chen Yan's true goal had been to save her master at all costs, a testament to the deep bond between master and disciple. Given Chen Yan's personality, even if there was only a one-in-ten-thousand chance, she would never give up. Yet, since her departure, even during the last appearance of the Purple Palace, she had not shown up. Now, with the Immortal Sect about to begin, Chen Yan still had not returned.</p><p>Chen Yan was a prodigy with a Heavenly Spirit Root and had already reached the Nascent Soul stage two hundred years ago. Her current cultivation level was undoubtedly far beyond what it had been. Even if she hadn't broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, it shouldn't have been difficult for her to gather a few allies. Had she given up on rescuing her master, or had something unexpected happened?</p><p>...</p><p>The Palace of the Fallen Deity.</p><p>Decay and silence reigned.</p><p>In the darkness, a faint glow illuminated a figure seated beside an ancient seal. This person, like an ancient bell, had been sitting here for who knows how many years, motionless, blending into the darkness. Sensing the fluctuations of the ancient seal, the Elder Demon Ye awoke from his meditation and slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>For over twenty years, he had not left this place, and his injuries had long since healed. He glanced around. The core crystals of the Shadow Crystal Tower floated around him, slowly rotating. However, the Nascent Souls were gone. Upon closer inspection, one could see that each crystal orb imprisoned a tiny figureâ€”these were the Nascent Souls, including Elder Tianzheng! Thin chains bound their limbs and necks. Their faces, once filled with resentment, were now blank, their eyes vacant, clearly having lost their sense of self. Trapped within the crystal orbs, they showed no signs of struggle.</p><p>Elder Demon Ye's gaze shifted, finally landing on the central crystal orb. Elder Tianzheng's Nascent Soul was imprisoned within. The demon stared deeply at him, then spat out a mouthful of essence blood. With a flick of his divine sense, a complex and sinister Blood Soul Curse formed in the air and flashed into Elder Tianzheng's forehead. Elder Tianzheng's face contorted in extreme pain. After years of resistance, he was exhausted and had little strength left to fight back. His last shred of clarity was devoured by the Blood Soul Curse, plunging him into deep despair as he was completely controlled by Elder Demon Ye.</p><p>A ghostly mist suddenly appeared within the crystal orb, transforming into countless spectral figures that lunged at Elder Tianzheng, eventually turning into chains that tightly bound him. Seeing this, Elder Demon Ye let out a long sigh of relief. He hadn't expected the old man to be so difficult to deal with. The other Nascent Souls had quickly crumbled, allowing the demon to refine them into the crystal orbs. Only Elder Tianzheng, despite his severe injuries, had continued to resist fiercely, his mind unyielding and flawless. Combined with Elder Demon Ye's own injuries, the process had dragged on until now.</p><p>"The Purple Palace is about to emerge! Release me quickly, or it will be too late!" A shrill scream echoed from beneath the seal.</p><p>Elder Demon Ye glanced indifferently. This demon, desperate to escape, had been pulling such stunts every few years. Of course, he didn't believe it. With a flicker of his figure, Elder Demon Ye appeared outside the forbidden area, gazing into the depths of the Palace of the Fallen Deity. Seeing the celestial phenomena in the sky, a flash of excitement and eagerness crossed his eyes.</p><p>The time had come!</p><p>"Throw down the Jade Bone! Hurry!" The demon screamed, even more impatient than Elder Demon Ye.</p><p>The Jade Bone had been placed by Elder Demon Ye at the edge of the ancient seal. For twenty years, the hope of escape had been within sight but out of reach, a true torment. This time, Elder Demon Ye did not hesitate. He grabbed the Jade Bone and hurled it into the seal.</p><p>A brilliant glow erupted, finally revealing the full extent of the seal. The area was vast and empty, surrounded by a swamp filled with rotting mud and filth. A stone path led through the swamp, ending at four towering stone pillars, each dozens of feet high, standing at the four cardinal directions. Their bases were deeply embedded in the swamp, forming the seal.</p><p>At this moment, the mud in the center of the pillars churned, revealing a small hole from which the demon's voice emanated. Elder Demon Ye's figure blurred, splitting into four, each flying toward one of the pillars. He had always stayed on the stone path, never daring to touch the swamp. The filth here had corrosive properties, and the demon trapped within had endured inhuman torment.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The four figures formed an extremely complex seal with their hands, pressing them against the pillars simultaneously. The seal trembled.</p><p>*Gurgle, gurgle...*</p><p>The Jade Bone fell into the swamp and immediately sank. From the depths came a burst of maniacal laughter.</p><p>Suddenly, a wave of mud surged into the air, accompanied by a nauseating stench. The sight was utterly repulsive. Amid the violently churning mud, a gray shadow shot out. Within the shadow was a skull. The moment the skull appeared, the seal reacted violently. Even after countless years, the fluctuations emitted by the pillars still held astonishing power.</p><p>Elder Demon Ye's expression changed slightly. Gritting his teeth, he activated the seal, shaking it with all his might. The power of the seal surged toward the gray shadow like barbed whips, lashing the skull mercilessly.</p><p>*Crack, crack, crack...*</p><p>The demon screamed in agony as the skull, now covered in cracks, charged toward the Jade Bone, on the verge of shattering. At the moment of the skull's destruction, a soul shadow shot out, narrowly diving into the Jade Bone. The seal's power immediately pursued, even more ferocious and terrifying.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The surface of the Jade Bone was torn open in several places, becoming tattered. The bone emitted a series of cracking sounds. Though incredibly hard, if it didn't escape soon, it would meet the same fate as the skull.</p><p>A ghostly light flowed over the Jade Bone, and countless eerie runes flickered across its surface. Suddenly, a powerful aura erupted. Two soul flames ignited in the empty eye sockets, burning fiercely. The Jade Bone, now possessed by the ghostly shadow, let out a piercing shriek and shot into the sky!</p>
