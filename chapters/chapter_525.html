<h1>Chapter 518: Straw</h1><p>This woman's name is Shi Ying.  Despite her youthful appearance, her actual age is considerably greater.  Qin Sang, during his time in Qingyang Market, had heard of Shi Ying from several disciples there.</p><p>Cultivators, before the decline of spiritual energy, possessed abundant vitality, unlike ordinary people who age easily.  Certain special cultivation methods are also remarkably effective at preserving one's appearance.  </p><p>Shi Ying, a rare ascetic, had dedicated herself to arduous cultivation in seclusion since childhood, sheltered from worldly affairs.  Her youthful appearance is therefore unsurprising.  This is also the source of her reputation.</p><p>Young cultivators, regardless of gender, rarely possess the fortitude to endure the loneliness and monotony of cultivation in their youth, remaining unperturbed by external distractions. Even powerful cultivators typically undergo a trial of the heart before achieving enlightenment and unwavering dedication to their path. Most cultivators may never achieve this.</p><p>Had Qin Sang not lived two lives and experienced death, he probably wouldn't have resisted the allure of worldly beauty. Shi Ying is different. From a young age, after entering the Qingyang Demon Sect, she displayed extraordinary willpower, seemingly focused solely on cultivation.  She is strikingly beautiful and possesses a captivating demeanor.  Many fellow disciples admired her, but she remained aloof, devoting herself entirely to cultivation and essential sect duties within her secluded chambers.  </p><p>This continued day and night, regardless of the season, setting her apart from her peers.  Qin Sang learned about Shi Ying from these admirers; he had never met her but seen her portrait from a Qingyang Demon Sect disciple. He had no interest in investigating a Qi Condensation cultivator, so his knowledge of Shi Ying remained limited.</p><p>“It’s her?” Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Shi Ying rarely left the mountain, her excursions limited to the Wuyaya Valley for training.  Wuyaya Valley lies east of the Qingyang Demon Sect, yet Shi Ying arrived from the south.  She appeared to have been weeping; what could cause such distress to a cultivator of such unwavering resolve?</p><p>Shi Ying’s personality is diametrically opposed to Yu Batie's, representing two extremes.  Qin Sang carefully chose Yu Batie as his target.  This sudden shift to Shi Ying leaves him uncertain, so he decides to wait and see what she chooses to do.</p><p>The coffin opened.</p><p>Shi Ying firmly gripped her defensive artifact, her eyes wide, intently watching the corpse inside, fearing a backlash.  The corpse remained still, showing no signs of reanimation.</p><p>After a while, with no change, Shi Ying pursed her lips, about to approach the coffin, when she remembered something and quickly checked the jade slip again.</p><p>After a moment, Shi Ying formed a hand seal, sending a soul imprint toward the corpse.</p><p>The soul imprint entered the corpse’s head without obstruction.</p><p>In Qin Sang's spiritual space, Qin Sang completely released his spirit, allowing Shi Ying's soul imprint to enter the depths of his own spirit, essentially surrendering control to the woman.</p><p>He dared to do this only because of his jade Buddha, which could dispel the soul imprint at any time.  No powerful cultivator would be so reckless as to allow someone to implant a soul imprint deep within their spiritual core.  Even if they could overcome the control with their powerful cultivation, completely erasing the soul imprint without repercussions would be nearly impossible.  Even a trace could become a foothold for a heart demon, a source of future trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, had no such concerns. The jade Buddha could dispel even the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, let alone the soul imprint of a Qi Condensation cultivator.</p><p>Once the soul imprint entered, Qin Sang's mind calmed, completely relinquishing control of his body.</p><p>Seeing her soul imprint successfully controlling the corpse, Shi Ying finally relaxed, stepping to the coffin and examining the corpse's condition with narrowed eyes.</p><p>After a moment, Shi Ying focused her thoughts.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The corpse stood upright, obeying her commands perfectly.</p><p>She learned from the jade slip that the corpse was incomplete, lacking the final step: the Gangsha Pill Condensation.  Before that, the corpse couldn't be used in combat; otherwise, it would explode from the uncontrolled Golden Core in its dantian. This is why the Corpse Path cultivator died, while the corpse survived.</p><p>He came here for our sect's Qingyang Gangying, didn't he?  But I don't know what powerful enemy he angered. He didn't get the Qingyang Gangying, and instead lost his life…" Shi Ying murmured.</p><p>She cultivated the Qingyang Demon Fire, so she naturally knew how rare the world's Qiantian Gangying was.</p><p>The evidence was before her.</p><p>The corpse, the pouch, the corpse refinement, the Golden Core, the Earthly Fiend Qi…</p><p>Everything was real, and her soul imprint wasn't rejected in the slightest, leaving her without any doubt.</p><p>"There's actually such a corpse refinement technique in the world…"</p><p>Shi Ying's heart stirred. She reopened the pouch, taking out a small pile of Shao Yin vials. Opening them, she discovered they were filled with Earthly Fiend Qi.</p><p>"As long as I use the Qingyang Gangying to complete the final step of corpse refinement, I can get a corpse comparable to a False Core Realm expert!"</p><p>Shi Ying's eyes widened, her grip on the Shao Yin vials tightening. Her voice trembled with excitement.</p><p>Suddenly, Shi Ying's eyes reddened, and two lines of tears streamed down her face. She wept uncontrollably.</p><p>"Father, Mother, your daughter can finally avenge you…"</p><p>Her mind was focused inward, but it didn't prevent Qin Sang from hearing the outside sounds.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was secretly astonished. This woman seemed to carry a deep-seated hatred.</p><p>No wonder…</p><p>Such a personality didn't form without reason.  A person's nature is formed; how could a young person withstand the temptations of the world?</p><p>What she heard next shocked Qin Sang even more.</p><p>Shi Ying suddenly knelt down, kowtowing nine times towards the south, saying with hatred, "Father, Mother, you must bless your daughter, so that I can personally kill that wicked Wen Yanjie and avenge you!"</p><p>The person who killed her parents was Wen Yanjie, her fellow sect uncle.</p><p>Qin Sang had sold a corpse to Wen Yanjie a few days ago.  He is two-faced; it's not surprising what he would do.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't comprehend this complex story of love and hate.</p><p>After learning about Shi Ying's hatred, Qin Sang immediately realized that Shi Ying was a more suitable candidate than Bi Yu Batian!</p><p>Shi Ying's talent is acceptable, but Wen Yanjie is better.</p><p>By the time she builds her foundation, Wen Yanjie might already have formed his Golden Core.  Even if Wen Yanjie fails to form his Golden Core and is trapped at the False Core Realm, Shi Ying would still need to cultivate for decades to reach his level.</p><p>More likely, she would never catch up with Wen Yanjie in her lifetime and wouldn't have a chance for revenge.</p><p>This 'refined corpse' is her only lifeline!</p>
