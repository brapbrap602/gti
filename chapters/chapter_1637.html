<h1>Chapter 1628: Boiling Snow Elixir</h1><p>Correction: My brain short-circuited yesterday, and I wrote Ice Phase instead of Water Phase, causing misunderstanding. While writing, the input method automatically suggested 'Refrigerator Lineage,' which I found strange at the time but didn't realize the error.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>To leave behind such a testament, it was highly likely a cultivator from the Formless Immortal Sect, seemingly staying behind as a rearguard.  Were these his legacy for future generations?</p><p>The Avatar silently scanned the tokens and other items, speculating that this person must have died with the hope of the Formless Immortal Sect's revival in his heart. He bowed towards the skeleton.  Of course, he had to thank this person; otherwise, the harvest within the treasury wouldn't have been insignificant, but it would have fallen far short of his prior expectations.</p><p>The rite complete.</p><p>The Avatar beckoned with a finger, drawing several jade slips into his hand.</p><p>*The Grand Unity Water Scripture*.</p><p>This was the only cultivation method within the jade slips, unsurprisingly belonging to the Water Dao. Its profundity surpassed even the Heavenly Clarity Scripture of the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>*Lightless Shield*, *Primordial Silence Divine Wheel*, *Misty Ripple Shadowless Phantom Body*...</p><p>Each one was a superior divine ability.</p><p>Some were incredibly esoteric, requiring dedicated comprehension. Others were more like methods for channeling True Essence, where sufficient cultivation could lead to enlightenment.</p><p>For example, *Lightless Shield*.</p><p>The Avatar perused it once, pondered briefly, then waved his hand before him. True Essence surged, then the fluctuations weakened, forming an invisible shield, its power satisfactory.</p><p>The Avatar noticed something. Casting this divine ability was easier than he imagined, suspecting it was related to refining the icy disc's Cold煞.</p><p>He didn't waste much time on this.</p><p>The Avatar looked through the jade slips one by one. The last one caught his attention the most; it actually recorded the treasured elixir recipes of the Water Phase lineage!</p><p>Overjoyed, the Avatar quickly scanned the jade slip, finally finding a spirit elixir named the Boiling Snow Elixir among the last three ancient recipes.  Its description matched the characteristics of the spirit elixir obtained from the Water Phase Master's suspected tomb.</p><p>Boiling Snow Elixir.</p><p>Lishen Flower, Tiangning Incense, Lishu Seed... three each...</p><p>Followed by a note:  Best refined by a cultivator practicing the *Grand Unity Water Scripture* who has reached the late Nascent Soul realm, condensing Grand Unity Golden Liquid to nurture the elixir. The success rate can be increased by more than ten percent.</p><p>Scanning the list of spiritual herbs on the recipe, even Qin Sang couldn't help but gasp.  Let alone their rarity, several were things he had never heard of.</p><p>Perhaps due to the passage of time, the names of the spiritual herbs had changed, and Qin Sang knew little about alchemy. However, the difficulty of refining this elixir was evident.</p><p>Its efficacy was truly astonishing.</p><p>Upon consuming a Boiling Snow Elixir, a cultivator would instantly gain an immense replenishment of Yuan Qi. Even depleted True Essence could be quickly replenished, and it was equally effective for late Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Reading this, Qin Sang immediately recalled the Three Lights Jade Liquid he obtained years ago. After the Three Lights Jade Liquid, he hadn't encountered another spirit elixir with such divine effects.</p><p>However, the Three Lights Jade Liquid’s potency was gentle, causing no adverse effects upon consumption and even nourishing the physical body. Qin Sang had even regenerated severed limbs with it.</p><p>The Boiling Snow Elixir was far more violent. After consumption, its medicinal power transformed into Yuan Qi like an avalanche.  The cultivator would inevitably be impacted, and even a single dose would place a tremendous burden on them.  After escaping danger, they must quickly find a place to heal; otherwise, their Dao Foundation might be damaged!</p><p>Even so, this didn't diminish the elixir's value in the slightest.</p><p>In times of crisis, it was equivalent to an extra life!</p><p>The other two elixir recipes placed alongside the Boiling Snow Elixir had different effects, each with its own merits. Their commonality lay in the extreme difficulty of refinement.</p><p>There were also many elixir recipes whose value was only slightly less than these three, including spirit elixirs that aided cultivation, which could greatly benefit both the Avatar and his true body.</p><p>He didn't understand alchemy and hadn't deliberately befriended any alchemy grandmasters in the Middle Continent. Collecting spiritual herbs was also troublesome, so he temporarily stored the recipes for future planning.</p><p>Within the jade slip were many chapters recording insights into alchemy, all written by master hands, likely the crystallization of the wisdom of generations of Formless Immortal Sect alchemy grandmasters.</p><p>Much of the content was abstruse and obscure, some seemingly written by a Divinity Transformation expert. Qin Sang skimmed through it, feeling dizzy and as if he were reading heavenly scriptures.</p><p>He was well aware of the value of this content. This single jade slip alone could nurture an alchemy grandmaster, but whether he would divert his attention to cultivate alchemy in the future required further consideration.</p><p>In terms of alchemy alone, the heritage of a top-tier sect was nothing less than this.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know that the five lineages of the Formless Immortal Sect, while independent, each had their own strengths.  Back then, the Water Phase Hall was renowned for its alchemy, even surpassing the Fire Phase Hall in fame.</p><p>He estimated that these elixir recipes were likely the entirety of the Water Phase lineage's collection.  However, the Water Phase lineage's cultivation methods and divine abilities definitely weren't limited to these jade slips.</p><p>The divine abilities and techniques left by the skeleton leaned more towards 'Water,' with no cultivation methods for the 'Ice' Dao.</p><p>"Was the other part of the inheritance taken by the tomb owner?"</p><p>He recalled the jade box taken by Elder Yanshan. Perhaps it was inside.</p><p>Next were the magical treasures, all of considerable power, but none were spirit treasures. There was one damaged treasure, a broken blade, suspected to have been a pseudo-spirit treasure in its complete state.</p><p>The Avatar gathered them up haphazardly and looked at the last item:  a set of neatly arranged tokens.</p><p>These peculiarly shaped tokens, made of a material similar to Profound Iron, were red on top and white below, totaling seven.</p><p>The upper half's edges were jagged, resembling a dancing crimson flame, while the lower half was perfectly regular, like a piece of clear profound ice.</p><p>"Ice-Fire Tokens?"</p><p>The Avatar picked up an Ice-Fire Token. It felt lukewarm to the touch, neither scorching nor icy. He examined it for a moment, casually giving it a name, as he hadn't seen any record of these tokens in the jade slips.</p><p>He didn't know if the skeleton hadn't had time to record them or had deliberately concealed this information.</p><p>He probed the Ice-Fire Token with his divine sense and then with True Essence, confirming it wasn't a magical treasure. However, the refining technique was quite profound, resembling a formation tool.</p><p>Unfortunately, the skeleton hadn't left any spirit formations.</p><p>However, the Avatar sensed a peculiar power from the Ice-Fire Token, somewhat familiar. He couldn't help but look at the mysterious icy disc.  Bringing them together yielded no reaction.</p><p>He had a gut feeling that there was a connection between these two treasures!</p><p>Unable to discern anything for the moment, the Avatar stepped over the skeleton, seeing a path ahead, and continued deeper into the hidden passage.</p><p>Soon enough, he indeed found a hidden chamber.</p><p>Before even entering, the Avatar felt an oppressive sensation close at hand. He could be certain that the hidden chamber was the source of the faint blue light.</p><p>If he guessed correctly, ahead lay the formation core of the Ice Instrument Palace's grand formation!</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>He pushed open the door with ease.</p><p>The scene within the hidden chamber was revealed to the Avatar:  an extraordinarily complex flag formation.</p><p>The flag formation was in ruins.</p><p>The spirit formation had a full eighty-one nodes, with treasure flags erected within.  The complete formation must have possessed astonishing power, yet now it was mostly empty.</p><p>The surviving treasure flags were also tattered and worn.</p><p>A rough count showed only three or five treasure flags remained intact. The broken flags supported the remnants of the formation, drawing from the spirit veins and operating autonomously, barely maintaining the faint blue light outside.</p><p>Most striking was the center of the spirit formation, where an ice platform stood. Carved into the ice platform was a circular groove, its size and shape identical to the mysterious icy disc!</p><p>Only there was no place for the Ice-Fire Tokens.</p><p>"The icy disc truly is the treasure suppressing the formation core!"</p><p>As this thought arose in the Avatar's mind, he felt a gust of cold wind rush towards him, piercingly cold.</p><p>Within the spirit formation, streams of cold air were constantly flowing, sensing the presence of an outsider in the hidden chamber and instinctively counterattacking.</p><p>Unfazed, the Avatar used the mysterious icy disc as a shield.</p><p>As expected, upon contact with the mysterious icy disc, the cold air instantly dissipated.</p><p>Relying on the mysterious icy disc to clear the path, the Avatar effortlessly reached the ice platform. He carefully observed the flag formation, pondered for a moment, then attempted to place the mysterious icy disc into the groove.</p><p>'Click!'</p><p>The icy disc settled into the groove, a perfect fit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the spirit formation didn't immediately activate as he had imagined.  Instead, it rapidly drew in power from the spirit veins, but this power didn't support the formation itself; it converged towards the central ice platform.</p><p>Divine light reappeared on the ice platform.</p><p>The Avatar could clearly see a tangible beam of cold light within the ice platform, revolving around the icy disc, undergoing a bizarre transformation.</p><p>This unprecedented sight piqued the Avatar's curiosity.</p><p>He gazed for a long time, then suddenly understood.</p><p>"So that's the function of the spirit formation! It's not the icy disc suppressing the formation core, but the grand formation nurturing the icy disc, accumulating power..."</p><p>Within the icy disc existed only Cold煞.</p><p>During his cultivation, he could sense that with every wisp of Cold煞 absorbed, a wisp was lost from the disc.</p><p>The disc would self-regenerate; otherwise, it couldn't have continuously supported the Water Phase Master's arrangements above the tomb.  But this process was undoubtedly extremely slow.</p><p>The Ice Instrument Palace's grand formation could accelerate the recovery of the Cold煞!</p><p>"No, it's not that simple.  The icy disc is also the treasure suppressing the formation core, capable of nourishing the spirit formation in return.  The two complement each other.  How ingenious!"</p><p>The Avatar placed a hand atop the icy disc. Through the disc, he immediately felt a connection between himself and the treasure flags within the spirit formation.</p><p>At the same time, the Avatar made an unexpected discovery.</p><p>Beside the spirit formation, concealed by it, was another hidden space!</p><p>"The Ice Instrument Palace's layout is so complex..."</p><p>The Avatar grumbled inwardly, glancing downwards, curious about what else was hidden within.  He had found the formation core, even obtained the Water Phase lineage's inheritance, and it still wasn't the end.</p><p>He calmed himself and began to explore this spirit formation.</p><p>While he could sense the treasure flags through the icy disc, it was limited to the intact ones. After so long, the spirit formation's continued function was already remarkable.  The damaged treasure flags were on the verge of collapse, and even a small fluctuation could cause them to crumble.</p><p>A single misstep could potentially cause the entire Ice Instrument Palace to collapse.</p><p>The Avatar gently touched the icy disc, activating the spirit formation with extreme caution. He finally heard a 'creaking' sound, then saw the wall beside him slowly shift open, revealing a dark space.</p><p>This space was clearly much larger.</p><p>He hadn't realized it before, but upon seeing the hidden space, the Avatar understood that this was the true center of the Ice Instrument Palace, not the hall where the spirit formation resided.</p><p>The Avatar considered, left the icy disc on the ice platform, and stepped inside.</p><p>"Hiss, such complex restrictions..."</p><p>Seeing the layout of the space, the Avatar was secretly shocked. The restrictions on the walls were dense and intricate, dazzling to the eye.</p><p>In the center of the space was another spirit formation, even more complex than the outer one.</p><p>However, this spirit formation was dormant, not functioning.</p><p>The Avatar glanced at it and knew it lacked the treasures to support it.</p><p>The spirit formation was shaped like a Taiji platform.  While the area around the platform was empty, there were numerous grooves on the ground.  Seeing the grooves, the Avatar flipped his hand and retrieved the Ice-Fire Tokens.  As expected, they fit perfectly inside!</p><p>The Ice-Fire Tokens were meant to be one with the grooves.</p><p>However, he only had seven, while there were forty-nine grooves on the ground!</p><p>Furthermore, the Avatar noticed that the Taiji platform had a seat for meditation, and at the Yin and Yang poles were two more indentations.</p><p>The Yin pole, identical to the outer ice platform, was clearly meant for the icy disc.</p><p>The Yang pole was shaped for a jade pendant.</p><p>"This formation is so complex, requiring both the icy disc and another treasure no less valuable.  It must have an extraordinary purpose.  I wonder what it's used for..."</p><p>The Avatar was puzzled.</p><p>The only way to find out was to try.</p><p>But he only had the icy disc, and the number of Ice-Fire Tokens was far too few.</p><p>After some thought, he decided to give it a try.  He retrieved the icy disc from the ice platform, returned to the Taiji platform, and first inserted the seven Ice-Fire Tokens at intervals.  Then, sitting cross-legged on the platform, he tentatively placed the icy disc at the Yin pole.</p><p>Lacking one treasure, it wasn't a complete spirit formation. Even if something unexpected happened, he could escape at any time.</p><p>The platform showed no abnormality.</p><p>But the moment the icy disc was in place, the restrictions on the walls lit up.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>Suddenly, the Avatar was horrified to see wisps of formless fire floating within the space.</p><p>"Yin Fire!"</p><p>The Avatar's voice was dry, his hair standing on end.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced the Three Calamities during his Nascent Soul breakthrough.  How could he not recognize Yin Fire?</p><p>However, the Yin Fire of the Nascent Soul tribulation was nothing compared to this.  Perhaps only the legendary Divinity Transformation tribulation could be this terrifying!</p><p>The Avatar was about to flee in panic when he realized the Yin Fire wasn't actually real but an illusion projected by the restrictions on the walls.</p><p>When he saw the scene within the illusion, the Avatar froze in place.</p><p>Within the illusion,</p><p>Yin Fire filled the sky.</p><p>Inside the Yin Fire was a Daoist, his face blurred, seemingly undergoing a tribulation.</p><p>Beneath the Daoist was this very Taiji platform!</p><p>However, on the Taiji platform, the treasures were complete.  Forty-nine Ice-Fire Tokens were perfectly arranged, the icy disc rested at the Yin pole, and a crimson immortal pendant was placed at the Yang pole!</p><p>The icy disc and the immortal pendant both radiated brilliantly.</p><p>Cold煞 surged skyward, transforming into an ice pillar.</p><p>The immortal pendant shot out a pillar of fire, its body seemingly on the verge of melting.</p><p>The forty-nine Ice-Fire Tokens and the two treasures connected with each other, rising into the air and circling the Daoist.</p><p>At that moment, the Extreme Yin Qi and Extreme Yang Qi, after passing through the platform and the Ice-Fire Tokens, didn't clash but merged into a peculiar force, flowing around the platform and the Daoist.</p><p>When this power touched him, the Daoist's trembling subsided considerably.</p><p>The formless Yin Fire's momentum weakened greatly!</p><p>"This is a recording of a Formless Immortal Sect ancestor's tribulation!  A tribulation formation! And it's a Divinity Transformation tribulation!"</p><p>The Avatar's eyes widened.  He never expected the icy disc to be a tribulation treasure.</p><p>"Can it only handle the first calamity, or all of them?"</p><p>The Avatar held his breath, concentrating intently. Unfortunately, the image was too blurry to discern the details of the Daoist's tribulation, but he gained considerable insight nonetheless.</p><p>Finally, the Daoist successfully overcame the Yin Fire calamity.</p><p>The next calamity was about to descend, but the Daoist didn't deactivate the platform.  The spirit formation's power intensified instead.</p><p>Just then, the Avatar was startled by a cracking sound.  Looking down, he saw the Ice-Fire Tokens on the ground nearing collapse.</p><p>The treasures were incomplete, Yin and Yang unbalanced.</p><p>And the number of Ice-Fire Tokens was insufficient; they couldn't hold on much longer.</p><p>He hurriedly retrieved the icy disc.</p><p>Instantly, the illusion vanished, the wall restrictions subsided, but the scene within the illusion was deeply imprinted in his mind.</p>
