<h1>Chapter 1988 The Ebon Bone Scripture</h1><p>“This time, you should remain at Bie Guan. It will be more conducive to your Nascent Soul formation.”</p><p>Taiyi noticed that Yulang was already at the peak of Golden Core, merely a step away from Nascent Soul.</p><p>Bie Guan was a Spirit Severing stage cultivator's dao field, a sacred ground for cultivation.</p><p>Only after breaking through to Nascent Soul would one possess the ability to act independently. Only then would Yulang truly deserve the title of  Sect Master.</p><p>Yulang's cultivation speed could be considered that of a genius in the Great Thousand World, but considering his status as a Spirit Severing disciple, this achievement was not particularly earth-shattering.</p><p>Taiyi knew that Yulang wasn't solely focused on cultivation; he contemplated many things beyond the realm of his current cultivation level.</p><p>For example, during the years he descended the mountain to experience the mortal world, his cultivation had barely progressed.</p><p>Since Qin Sang allowed Yulang to do so, there must have been a reason, and Taiyi wouldn't question it.</p><p>Taiyi activated his escape technique, enveloping Yulang in遁光 (escaping light), and flew to the summit of Bie Guan, activating the cave dwelling's restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang was not in the cave dwelling at this time; he was deep underground.</p><p>The Falling Soul Abyss Sect had established their sect here for a reason. At the bottom of the ravine, Yin Sha Qi converged, exceptionally pure. That black river was formed from this Yin energy.</p><p>The *Obliterating Yang Corpse Classic* required the use of Yin energy to temper the body.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely submerged in the black river, absorbing strands of Yin energy into his body, cultivating with its aid.</p><p>Relying on the poisons refined by Ling E and several potent poisons sent by Gu Yun Sou, Qin Sang had cultivated the *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement* to the peak of the fifth level.  He was only waiting to step into the sixth level to possess a true Azure Phoenix manifestation.</p><p>After reaching the peak of the fifth level, Qin Sang clearly perceived the existence of a bottleneck.</p><p>Breaking through this barrier would grant him physical prowess comparable to the Spirit Severing stage.</p><p>Reaching this level of cultivation, every breakthrough was as difficult as ascending to heaven, and countless cultivators were stopped at this point.</p><p>The vast majority of late Nascent Soul cultivators remained at this stage for their entire lives.</p><p>This time, there would be no mighty figure to infuse Qin Sang with their essence, allowing him to experience the profound mysteries of a higher realm.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement* was a peerless wondrous technique. Qin Sang was exceptionally fortunate to possess a faint manifestation image at the Nascent Soul stage, which undoubtedly benefited his breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang was already a Spirit Severing cultivator, and although it was a different Dao, he could still draw parallels and apply his understanding.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wanted to maximize his chances of success, striving for a breakthrough during the Star Essence infusion. While honing his cultivation, he also needed to accumulate more.</p><p>The higher the level of *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement*, the more it inclined towards the Dao of Manifestations.</p><p>After cultivating to the peak of the fifth level, Qin Sang felt that this technique hadn't tempered his physical body to the utmost limit. There was still room for improvement. If he continued to refine his physical body, it might be more beneficial for his breakthrough.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang had been studying the murals and the *Obliterating Yang Corpse Classic* for these past years.</p><p>Cultivating the *Obliterating Yang Corpse Classic* to its peak would transform him into an Indestructible Bone Corpse.</p><p>Unlike when he was forming his Golden Core and had no other choice, Qin Sang had no intention of becoming a corpse refiner again.</p><p>He decided to extract the essence of the *Obliterating Yang Corpse Classic*, cross-reference it with the murals, and create his own body refinement method.</p><p>This method didn't need to be overly profound. It wouldn't be his primary cultivation technique, and Qin Sang didn't need to consider its future potential. He only needed to create the Nascent Soul stage portion for now, to strengthen himself as much as possible before his breakthrough.  It would serve as a secret technique.</p><p>For him, it wasn't too difficult.</p><p>Since it drew inspiration from the *Obliterating Yang Corpse Classic*, it would naturally be related to bone tempering.</p><p>With the source of the technique—the nine murals—and the insights of past Falling Soul Abyss cultivators, Qin Sang quickly organized his thoughts.</p><p>The core of the *Obliterating Yang Corpse Classic* was using Yin energy to temper the bones. Qin Sang combined it with the body refinement techniques he had acquired before, taking their essence and discarding the dross. He also recalled the Ebon Bone markings of the Wu Clan, and thus named it the *Ebon Bone Scripture*!</p><p>Qin Sang was currently bathing in the black river, silently circulating the *Ebon Bone Scripture*, absorbing the Yin Sha Qi.</p><p>As the Yin energy entered his body, passing through his skin, flesh, and blood, it permeated his bones. The extreme Yin coldness made Qin Sang feel as if he were in an ice cellar.</p><p>His expression was obscure, his bones throbbing with stinging pain and itching, as if they were being shattered inch by inch, then overrun by countless ants.</p><p>Bizarre changes were occurring within his body.  Wherever the Yin energy contacted his bones, distorted black lines would appear, resembling some kind of runes, eventually covering his entire body.</p><p>All the bones in his body turned pitch black like charcoal, as if they had necrotized.  His flesh and blood seemed to separate from his bones, and his vitality was being devoured.</p><p>The moment Taiyi activated the restriction, Qin Sang immediately sensed it, his eyelids fluttering.</p><p>His skin vibrated imperceptibly, repelling the 'river water.' The Yin energy that had already entered his body was instantly devoured by his bones.</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal. His flesh, blood, and bones gradually returned to their normal color, and his vitality was restored.</p><p>Clenching his fists and feeling the improvement brought about by his recent cultivation, Qin Sang was quite satisfied with the secret technique he had created. He rose and left the black river.</p><p>The cave dwelling's entrance opened.</p><p>Taiyi respectfully bowed, presenting a bamboo slip. "Lord Emissary, this is a talisman message sent by Yun Du Tian, saying it is for you."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and retrieved the bamboo slip.  Seeing its contents, he realized Yun Du Tian had just received the Azure Firmament Decree!</p><p>Gu Yun Sou had guessed correctly; he shouldn't be at the sect now, otherwise, he would have come personally to discuss it.</p><p>The appearance of the Azure Firmament Decree meant that the Azure Firmament Assembly would take place in ten years!</p><p>The Azure Firmament Assembly was the grandest event in the entire Moon渎 Bay cultivation world. Various factions gathered, and mighty figures rarely seen would appear.  It touched upon all aspects and had far-reaching influence. The assembly procedures alone lasted for half a year.</p><p>It could be said that this assembly would determine the structure of the Moon渎 Bay cultivation world until the next Azure Firmament Assembly.</p><p>The Azure Firmament Assembly was usually held at the Azure Firmament Sect, and this time was no exception.  Qin Sang would finally be able to witness the overlord of this world.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang said to Taiyi, "In ten years, you and Yulang will accompany me on a trip."</p><p>"Your subordinate obeys!"</p><p>Taiyi didn't ask the reason and immediately agreed.</p><p>Bringing them along to witness the Azure Firmament Assembly and become acquainted with the faces there would be beneficial to the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Yulang still needed to grow, and for a long time to come, Taiyi would be the mainstay of the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Putting away the bamboo slip, Qin Sang inquired about Taiyi's cultivation. "How has your cultivation been recently?  Any problems?"</p><p>With his unreserved assistance, Taiyi was now a mid-Nascent Soul expert.</p><p>However, after pushing Taiyi to late Nascent Soul, Qin Sang's help would be limited.</p><p>Whether or not he could step into Spirit Severing would depend on Taiyi's own fate.</p><p>After giving his guidance, Taiyi returned to the main temple, while Yulang remained at Bie Guan to cultivate.</p><p>…</p><p>For over a hundred years, the cultivation world remained unusually calm, with nothing noteworthy happening.</p><p>Ten years passed in a flash.</p><p>On this day, Qin Sang flew out of the black river, directly leaving Bie Guan, leisurely flying over thousands of mountains and rivers, and appeared at the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Since the Green Ram Temple was built, this was the first time he, the founding ancestor, had visited.</p><p>Taiyi and Yulang, who was now a Nascent Soul cultivator, were waiting in front of the main hall, and hurried forward to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't enter the main hall. Standing with his hands behind his back in front of the hall, he looked at the vibrant temple and nodded slightly. "Not bad!"</p><p>Receiving Qin Sang's approval, both Taiyi and Yulang felt a sense of relief.</p><p>They had always been apprehensive, fearing they would disappoint Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>After a short stay, Qin Sang took them with him, leaving the Green Ram Temple, continuing eastward, and entered the Yun Du Mountains.</p><p>Today was the day he and Gu Yun Sou had agreed to depart.</p><p>Since entering the Great Thousand World, Qin Sang had long admired Yun Du Tian, but this was his first visit.</p><p>Yun Du Tian's sect was located on the main peak of the Yun Du Mountains, the most exquisite and perilous location.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived on a cloud, and from afar, he saw a white ribbon cascading from the heavens.</p><p>Looking up, he couldn't see the top of the waterfall. The scene was hazy and awe-inspiring.</p><p>Mist lingered, never dissipating.</p><p>Behind the waterfall, immortal mountains and towering peaks appeared faintly, shrouded in mystery, involuntarily arousing the desire to explore.</p><p>Yulang and Taiyi, having been invited to visit before, maintained their composure, but could still recall the shock they felt upon first seeing it.</p><p>From a distance, one could see the waterfall but not hear the sound of water.</p><p>As the cloud drew closer, a deafening roar suddenly erupted. The water crashed against the earth, its sound like thunder.</p><p>At that moment, a fissure suddenly opened in the middle of the waterfall, the water flowing gently to both sides, revealing a rainbow gate.</p><p>Nine escaping lights flew out from behind the rainbow gate.</p><p>The nine escaping lights stopped in front of the waterfall, lining up in a row. They were the Nine Immortals of Yun Du.</p><p>Each of the Nine Immortals of Yun Du possessed an outstanding demeanor and ethereal aura. They saluted the approaching cloud: "We respectfully welcome Daoist Qing Feng!"</p><p>One day, when the Green Ram Temple had so many experts, it would truly be considered a prominent sect.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, nodded with a smile, and flew closer. Yun Xi stepped forward and personally led the way for Qin Sang.</p><p>Taiyi and Yulang were already familiar with them and were led by others.</p><p>Passing through the rainbow gate, the scene suddenly opened up.</p><p>Mountain peaks clustered together, clouds surged like angry waves, and the atmosphere was magnificent.</p><p>Among the immortal mountains, countless pavilions and towers stood, and numerous disciples looked towards them with curiosity and awe.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Yun Xi to the main hall and saw Gu Yun Sou waiting in front of the hall. He laughed heartily, "Fellow Daoist, there's no need for such a grand welcome."</p><p>"How can we neglect etiquette when a distinguished guest visits?"</p><p>Gu Yun Sou smiled, inviting Qin Sang into the hall.  Yun Xi personally attended to them, serving spiritual tea.</p><p>"I have also invited a few fellow Daoists to join us on this journey.  Daoist, do you mind?" Gu Yun Sou asked.</p><p>"I would be delighted! I was hoping to get acquainted with more fellow Daoists."</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head and glanced outside the hall.</p><p>A  lou ship was floating outside the mountain.  The lou ship wasn't particularly large or small, but its design was luxurious. Qin Sang could tell at a glance that the entire ship was constructed from exceptionally precious spiritual wood.</p><p>The formations inscribed on the hull didn't seem like those of a warship, and its speed probably wasn't very fast either. Could it be that such a great cost was spent on a mere travel tool?</p><p>"This Cloud Traversing Treasure Ship was purchased by our sect at great expense from Eternal Stronghold Mountain. The Azure Firmament Assembly has an unfortunate custom where sects compete from the very beginning, comparing their flying artifacts.  If the flying artifact is slightly inferior, it will be openly mocked.  If one doesn't want to spend extravagantly, they either ride with another sect or quietly enter the city without using a flying artifact. I cannot escape this custom either…"</p><p>Gu Yun Sou said self-deprecatingly.</p><p>"Ancestor Ming Hu is surely not one to suffer such humiliation; he must be the type to enter the city quietly.  I can only rely on your esteemed sect's treasure ship," Qin Sang said with a smile.  Ancestor Ming Hu's legacy didn't contain any top-tier flying artifacts.</p><p>"Certainly! Certainly!"</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, Gu Yun Sou got down to business, bringing up the jade slip Qin Sang had given him years ago.</p><p>"Regarding the Azure Origin Frost Essence Divine Liquid that Daoist requested, we have a lead."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang leaned forward slightly.  "Has Fellow Daoist gathered all the ingredients for the formula?"</p><p>"Not yet, but we are not far off," Gu Yun Sou said. "I befriended a grandmaster alchemist at the previous Azure Firmament Assembly. Everyone calls him Grandmaster Yue Shang. His alchemy skills are profound, and he's not as eccentric as some other alchemy grandmasters.  I always ask Grandmaster Yue Shang for help when refining high-grade pills, and I've contacted him for assistance this time as well.  Not long ago, Grandmaster Yue Shang replied that he happens to have the two rarest spiritual herbs listed in the formula, and he is willing to provide them, but on one condition."</p><p>"What condition?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The Azure Origin Frost Essence Divine Liquid was crucial for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's cultivation.  Once both the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and his *Celestial Demon Physique Refinement* broke through, he could consider setting off. Regardless of Grandmaster Yue Shang's conditions, he would try his best to meet them.</p><p>"Grandmaster Yue Shang wants to meet the owner of the formula," Gu Yun Sou said, a flicker of confusion in his eyes.</p><p>When he heard this condition, he thought Grandmaster Yue Shang had seen through Qin Sang's background, but after asking, he found that wasn't the case.</p><p>Grandmaster Yue Shang's answer was ambiguous, shrouded in mystery, yet also quite eager. It was unclear what connection he had with the formula.</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he immediately guessed the reason.</p><p>The *Panhu True Scripture* was a wondrous cultivation method inherited from the Wu Clan. The formulas recorded within were vastly different from those of the human race and held immense appeal for human alchemists.</p><p>In the Talisman World, Qin Sang had frequently exchanged formulas with great success.</p><p>Grandmaster Yue Shang must have also noticed the uniqueness of the Azure Origin Frost Essence Divine Liquid.  He just didn't know if he had realized that the formula came from the Wu Clan.</p><p>Perhaps Grandmaster Yue Shang knew some secrets regarding the Wu Clan, and he might be able to inquire about their whereabouts.</p><p>Even if it weren't for the formula, Qin Sang had to meet Grandmaster Yue Shang!</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang said, "I am the owner of the formula.  Will Grandmaster Yue Shang also attend the Azure Firmament Assembly?  If so, I would trouble Fellow Daoist to arrange a meeting for me."</p><p>Gu Yun Sou readily agreed.</p><p>The two continued to discuss their itinerary.</p><p>Yun Xi quietly left and issued a decree.  Figures flew out from the mountain, assembling in front of the Cloud Traversing Treasure Ship.</p><p>Taiyi and Yulang were also brought over.</p><p>For this trip, Yun Du Tian had mobilized quite a few people. There were also members from other factions in the Yun Du Mountains joining them, and soon over a hundred people had gathered.</p><p>Including Yun Xi, four of the Nine Immortals of Yun Du were present.</p><p>The rest were elite disciples of Yun Du Tian, the lowest being at the Foundation Establishment stage, with representatives from every realm above.</p><p>Each of them was filled with excitement and anticipation.</p><p>There would also be competitions among disciples from various sects at the Azure Firmament Assembly, with generous rewards.  If they could achieve a good ranking, not only would they bring honor to their sect, but it would also be a great opportunity.</p><p>Once everyone had assembled,</p><p>Yun Xi activated the Cloud Traversing Treasure Ship and instructed the disciples to board.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou glanced outside the hall and said, "Daoist, we should depart as well."</p><p>"Please!"</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The Cloud Traversing Treasure Ship trembled, ripples appearing beneath its hull, clear waves rippling. The bow tilted slightly upwards, and a crystal embedded at the front suddenly emitted a cyan light.</p><p>In an instant, Yun Du Tian was bathed in cyan radiance.</p><p>A beam of cyan light pierced through the sea of clouds, shooting towards the heavens.</p><p>Space trembled violently as the Cloud Traversing Treasure Ship expanded with the wind, transforming into a giant treasure ship, 'crashing' into the sea of clouds and setting sail!</p><p>The treasure ship sailed through the sky, and those on board couldn't feel the slightest bump.</p><p>Flying out of Yun Du Tian, the cyan radiance diffused, concealing the ship and blocking any prying eyes from the outside.</p><p>The treasure ship quickly left the Yun Du Mountains, flew over the fire domain, and continued to speed northwards.</p>
