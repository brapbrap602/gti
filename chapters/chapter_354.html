Chapter 347:  Sensing

At that moment, Liang Yan seemed to sense something, jolting him awake from his meditation. He abruptly looked towards the courtyard, a surprised expression dawning on his face.

Heart-Eating Insects!

Since the destruction of the Kuiyin Sect, Liang Yan hadn't sensed the fluctuation of Heart-Eating Insects for a long time.  The remaining Heart-Eating Insects of the Kuiyin Sect were few, and after the sect's collapse and the deaths of most of its higher-ups, the whereabouts of the surviving insects were unknown.

The Kuiyin Patriarch's poisonous insect technique, refining Heart-Eating Insects into Gu, was divided into three parts: cultivating the Gu, controlling the Gu, and the antidote. Without knowing the antidote, the poison was virtually incurable!

This poisonous insect technique was extremely vicious, a closely guarded secret within the Kuiyin Sect. Only the Patriarch's most favored and closest disciples had the opportunity to learn it.

Ordinary Foundation Establishment disciples were not qualified.

Yue Wu, diligently carrying out Elder Yi's orders and handling the Kuiyin Sect's external affairs, despite hindering his own cultivation, had been taught the technique.

Though Liang Yan wasn't qualified to learn the technique, he was close to Yue Wu, almost like a half-disciple, often assisting him, serving as his right-hand man.  Thus, he learned the Gu control technique from Yue Wu.

At that time, he was only at the Qi Condensation stage, yet the Foundation Establishment cultivator controlled by the Heart-Eating Insects was completely submissive, daring not to disobey.

After the Kuiyin Sect's destruction, everyone scattered, its disciples fleeing in panic.  Only a few survived. Those manipulated by the Heart-Eating Insects were unexpectedly freed.

The person Liang Yan knew disappeared mysteriously after the sect's destruction.

Only those who experienced it knew the terrifying power of the Heart-Eating Insects.  Those who had been freed would do anything to avoid falling under their control again, hiding themselves carefully.

For years, Liang Yan hadn’t encountered a single one.

Unexpectedly, he sensed the fluctuation of a Heart-Eating Insect today.

"After all these years, thinking everyone from the Kuiyin Sect was dead, they can't contain themselves and dare to show their faces?"

Liang Yan sneered, not finding it strange.

Cultivators couldn’t stay in seclusion forever. Whether facing cultivation bottlenecks or lacking resources, they had to venture out.

For decades, the Yuanzhao Sect relentlessly hunted down the Kuiyin Sect's remnants, openly declaring their intentions, backed by the Wujimen, one of the Eight Great Righteous Sects.

Even when Kuiyin Sect demons escaped to the heartland of demonic forces, the Yuanzhao Sect captured one in Qingyang City, in the far east of Qiongxiong Pass, and publicly executed him. This caused a great uproar among the demonic cultivators.

However, the Yuanzhao Sect avoided unnecessary enemies, only targeting Kuiyin Sect members due to personal grudges.

Demonic cultivators were inherently ruthless. No one was willing to stand up for the Kuiyin Sect’s remnants; they merely made a show of displeasure to prevent the Yuanzhao Sect from acting so recklessly.

Almost all of the well-known Foundation Establishment elders were killed.  Even the few survivors were terrified, living like rats, never daring to show themselves.

Fortunately, Liang Yan was only at the Qi Condensation stage back then, not a formally accepted disciple and therefore inconspicuous.  Otherwise, the Yuanzhao Sect would have made him their target.  He wouldn’t have lived so comfortably.

The Yuanzhao Sect didn't bother with such small fry.

Inconspicuous Qi Condensation disciples like Liang Yan, who changed their identities after leaving the Kuiyin Sect and were careful not to reveal their past, managed to survive.

Of course, they couldn't learn that poisonous Gu technique.

This person didn't expect to meet me here?

Liang Yan sensed the Heart-Eating Insect's fluctuation moving away.

This person seems to have come and gone quickly from Fengcang Market, probably just for supplies, demonstrating caution.

Liang Yan’s eyes flashed, calmed his breath, opened the door and went outside.

The power of the Heart-Eating Insect Gu remained fresh in Liang Yan’s memory.

He wasn’t sure if the Gu technique would work on Golden Core cultivators, but if the person was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, they would become his puppet!

The stronger, the better!

A surge of excitement coursed through Liang Yan, though his habitual caution prevented him from acting rashly.

His spiritual sense locked onto the Gu’s movements.  Liang Yan pushed open the door, paused, glanced at the room on the right, activated the restriction, and entered.

A middle-aged beauty sat cross-legged in the room – Shi Hong.


Shi Hong was meditating when she was startled awake.  Opening her eyes, she saw a stranger in her room, causing her to jump. Recognizing Liang Yan, her expression softened slightly, though she remained wary.

“Senior Brother Liang,” she said, “What brings you here so suddenly?  Perhaps a task for me?”

Liang Yan’s eyes held a hint of darkness. Ignoring her question, he stared at her and asked, “Have you refined the Easy Cold Fruit?”

Shi Hong nodded, a wry smile on her face. “I refined the spirit fruit according to the shopkeeper’s instructions, wasting none of its potency.  Unfortunately, its effects weren’t as powerful as he claimed. The bottleneck remains.”

Shi Hong’s cultivation remained at the eighth level of Qi Refinement.  She had been stuck at the ninth level for decades, unable to break through.

Liang Yan looked at her intently. “The ninth level is the greatest hurdle in Qi Refinement.  Even I struggled greatly to overcome it.

“But with your exceptional talent and the assistance of the Yama Banner,

“and considering the ten or more elixirs I’ve found for you over the years,  your continued stagnation is surprising.

“It seems even a superior spiritual root isn’t a guarantee.”

Shi Hong felt immense shame. “I’m so dull, Senior Brother. I’ve disappointed you.”

Liang Yan shook his head.

“The disappointment isn’t mine, it’s yours.

“At your age and with your gifts, if you broke through now, I could find you a Foundation Establishment Pill.  Your chances of establishing your foundation would be significantly higher.

“Wait a few more years, and there may be no hope at all.

“You possess a dual spiritual root, possessing the potential for Golden Core cultivation, yet you’re stuck at Qi Refinement.  Aren’t you regretful?

“I had planned to become your Dao companion once you reached Foundation Establishment.  We could travel the world together, a blissful couple.

“How much longer must I wait, Shi Hong?”

Publicly rebuked, Shi Hong hung her head in shame. But unbeknownst to Liang Yan, her eyes flashed with intense hatred.

“I’ve just remembered something. I’ll be back soon. Remain in your cave and cultivate diligently.  Strive to break through that bottleneck.”

Liang Yan turned and left, closing the door behind him.  His face hardened, and he let out a cold snort.  He muttered to himself, “Does she think I don’t know her true intentions?  If she weren’t relatively obedient and useful for minor tasks, I would have dealt with her long ago!”
