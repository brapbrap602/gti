<h1>Chapter 108: Emergence</h1><p>Bai was merely weakened, without any visible injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly inquired about his experience, then asked, "How many places did you visit, Fellow Daoist? Did anything stir your memories?"</p><p>Bai's tone wasn't optimistic. "I lingered too long in the Rainy Wasteland of the North Sea, and after searching fruitlessly, I hurried to the Wu Clan's Continent. These two locations were the most likely to trigger my memories. Besides these, I only briefly explored a few secret realms mentioned in ancient legends, but sadly, none of them felt familiar. My previous guess was probably correct. The Seven Kills Hall and the Boundless Sea likely had no connection in ancient times. They ended up here for some unknown reason after the great upheaval."</p><p>"In that case, Fellow Daoist, return to the Small Cold Realm with me. The Purple Subtlety Palace and the Seven Kills Hall are intricately linked, which might help you remember something. Also, about the inner hall of the Seven Kills Hall…"</p><p>Qin Sang recounted the news Ning Wu Hui had sent. "The Seven Kills Hall will emerge within two years. Fellow Daoist, quickly recover your cultivation and refrain from venturing out."</p><p>"Two years? Such a short time. Indeed, it's not advisable to go out again. I'll go into seclusion immediately. I won't disturb you further, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Bai readily agreed and returned to his cave.</p><p>After seeing Bai off, Qin Sang didn't rush into seclusion. He first organized the Thousand Jun Ring, making sure nothing was missed, and then summoned the Demonic Banners.</p><p>This time, he summoned all nine of them.</p><p>The nine Demonic Banners formed an array whose power was among the top tier of high-grade magical treasures, but the difficulty of manipulating them surpassed that of true high-grade magical treasures.</p><p>If a Foundation Establishment cultivator were fortunate enough to obtain a high-grade magical treasure, unless it was their natal treasure, it would be difficult to unleash its full power, but they could still activate it.</p><p>The Demonic Banners were different. If one's strength was insufficient, they couldn't suppress the backlash of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and shouldn't force it.</p><p>After both his cultivation and physical body had broken through, Qin Sang had been attempting to manipulate the Nine Demonic Banners to form an array. He discovered that his biggest limitation was his divine sense.</p><p>After the Ebony Sword merged with the Soul Nourishing Wood, it had the effect of nurturing the soul and condensing divine sense. Qin Sang's divine sense was gradually transforming. Although the extent wasn't obvious, with the passage of time, he could sense a definite change.</p><p>"The condensation of my divine sense makes it easier for me to control magical treasures. I can give it a try."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the fluttering Nine Demonic Banners in front of him and mused, "In these two years, I will focus on familiarizing myself with the Nine Demonic Banners array. Even if I can only unleash a few attacks, it will serve as a trump card."</p><p>Then Qin Sang sighed again. "Among those entering the inner hall of the Seven Kills Hall, there are many Nascent Soul Grandmasters. It's best not to reveal the Demonic Banners in front of these people, lest another disaster befall me. Speaking of which, I wonder where Old Devil Mu has hidden himself. Will he enter the Seven Kills Hall this time?"</p><p>…</p><p>Cultivation made one oblivious to the passage of time.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai spent two years in diligent cultivation.</p><p>One day, while Qin Sang was in secluded cultivation, he suddenly felt his restrictive formation being triggered. With a wave of his hand, a transmission talisman flew into his palm.</p><p>Upon learning the contents of the transmission talisman, Qin Sang abruptly stood up. "It's finally here!"</p><p>Quickly storing all his belongings, Qin Sang stepped out of his cave and awakened Bai, who was also in seclusion.</p><p>"The Seven Kills Hall is about to emerge?"</p><p>Bai was also delighted upon hearing this. He looked around, puzzled. "Where's Ning Wu Hui?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ning sent a message saying that, as a Heavenly Dao Sect disciple, he needs to travel to the Seven Kills Hall with his fellow sect members. We'll go ahead, and we'll meet inside the Seven Kills Hall."</p><p>Qin Sang explained.</p><p>Bai nodded, not asking any further questions, and entered the Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly left the city and then flew towards East Gate Island.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang returned to East Gate Island and found that a number of cultivators had already gathered there.</p><p>Qin Sang found an inn and waited for news.</p><p>Over the next few days, more and more cultivators arrived on the island.</p><p>The biggest difference from the previous two times was the frequent appearance of Nascent Soul cultivators among them, including Grandmasters from top sects. The strength of the lone cultivators was also noticeably higher than before.</p><p>The Seven Kills Hall's spontaneous emergence, although no longer requiring vast amounts of precious spiritual materials to set up top-level spirit arrays, had higher requirements for the cultivators entering it.</p><p>Without the protection of the jade talismans, cultivators not only risked getting lost in the storm but also had to face the Seven Kills Hall's grand formation directly.</p><p>However, the outer spirit array of the Seven Kills Hall wouldn't open completely and still possessed formidable power.</p><p>Only Nascent Soul Grandmasters or cultivators with sufficient strength could pass through the spirit array and enter the Seven Kills Hall. Those whose strength was insufficient would perish within the spirit array.</p><p>However, with Qin Sang's strength, he didn't need to worry about the outer spirit array.</p><p>Such a small East Gate Island had so many Nascent Soul Grandmasters present. All Foundation Establishment cultivators were exceptionally well-behaved, finding an inn or a cave and staying put, fearing they might cause some misunderstanding and offend a Nascent Soul Grandmaster.</p><p>As time passed day by day, the atmosphere on the island grew increasingly tense.</p><p>Until late at night, ten days later.</p><p>As if by prior agreement, the Nascent Soul Grandmasters suddenly emerged from seclusion.</p><p>In an instant, various colored lights illuminated the sky above East Gate Island, revealing powerful auras.</p><p>"Old Ghost Mu, you dare enter the Seven Kills Hall? Aren't you afraid of perishing inside and having your Mu family's stronghold wiped out by Old Devil Duan?" A strange laughter suddenly echoed in the air.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a gray streak of light swerved, approaching a nearby azure streak of light.</p><p>There were two figures within the azure streak of light: a portly old man and a young maiden. The old man didn't get angry and said with a faint smile, "Old Devil Duan hasn't dared to show his face for over a hundred years since I injured him last time. Moreover, fifty years ago was when his heavenly tribulation arrived. Knowing Old Devil Duan, unless he obtained some incredible opportunity, his chances of surviving the heavenly tribulation are less than ten percent. What's there to worry about?"</p><p>"Old Ghost Mu, your heavenly tribulation is also approaching, isn't it? Even if you don't perish in the Seven Kills Hall this time, I'm afraid you'll soon follow in Old Devil Duan's footsteps. I just wonder if the two of you will fight after you arrive in the underworld?"</p><p>The gray streak of light flew alongside the portly old man. Seeing the young maiden beside him, he asked in surprise, "You even brought your precious granddaughter? Could you…"</p><p>The portly old man sighed. "Can you live much longer than me? Our path to immortality is severed, and the heavenly tribulation is imminent. Even those as strong as us can't avoid birth, aging, sickness, and death. If I can gain something in the Seven Kills Hall, I might be able to continue to linger on. If I fail, I can only pave a way for my descendants before perishing. I heard that among your disciples, there are also two with decent talent. Why didn't you bring them?"</p><p>The person within the gray streak of light chuckled. "I'm not like you, Old Ghost Mu! The spirit array of the Seven Kills Hall will exert a strange suppression on Nascent Soul cultivators like us. Bringing disciples inside will add another layer of burden to me. I haven't lived enough yet, so naturally, I have to give it my all."</p><p>As they spoke, these Nascent Soul Grandmasters gradually flew further away.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang and the others dare to move.</p><p>Streaks of light flew out of East Gate Island, following the Nascent Soul cultivators, shooting eastward like meteors.</p>
