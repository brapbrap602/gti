<h1>Chapter 444: A Matter of Life and Death, or a Game?</h1><p>As far as the eye could see, islands of varying sizes dotted the waters. Many were already occupied, with houses built upon them. Most were simple wooden structures or stone dwellings conjured by spells.  Of course, there were also exquisitely crafted pavilions and winding streams, clear signs of meticulous design, but these were rare. After all, cultivators were summoned here to fight, not to indulge in luxury.</p><p>At the very center of all the islands lay the most eye-catching one – the new Stargazing Isle, formed by Serpent Witch from dozens of smaller islands she had gathered.</p><p>Serpent Witch and a group of Golden Core cultivators had established their caves on Stargazing Isle and its neighboring islands.</p><p>With Stargazing Isle as the center, Righteous Path and Demonic Path Foundation Establishment cultivators were clearly divided. Righteous cultivators mostly gathered on the west side, and the Demonic Path on the east, mirroring the layout of the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>As more and more cultivators from the Small Cold Realm were summoned, the divide between the Righteous and Demonic Paths deepened. Even with a major conflict looming, they still couldn't put aside their differences.</p><p>This was what puzzled Qin Sang the most.</p><p>Neither the Small Cold Realm nor the Heavenly Mandate Alliance seemed to have the resolve to prepare for a decisive battle.</p><p>Three years ago, when the two sides first began their standoff in these waters, their numbers were limited and their spirit arrays unstable. There were indeed several fierce battles, extremely intense.</p><p>Both sides rallied their forces, clashing repeatedly outside the Sea of Mists with thousands of cultivators involved.  At the most critical moment, Qin Sang and his companions were forced to flee into the Sea of Mists, nearly having their still-unstable Truewater Mirage Formation breached.</p><p>Of course, there were also times when the Small Cold Realm had the upper hand, pursuing their enemies relentlessly all the way to the Clearlake region, nearly razing it to the ground.</p><p>That period was the most dangerous Qin Sang had experienced.  Fortunately, with the support of his sect and alongside his fellow disciples, he managed to survive.</p><p>Overall, the two sides could be considered evenly matched.</p><p>Especially after their grand formations were fully established, each side, relying on their own formation, gained a firm foothold, unable to overcome the other, resulting in a stalemate.</p><p>It was important to remember that the Small Cold Realm was fighting on two fronts.  With frequent anomalies and Cloud Beast uprisings in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Small Cold Realm had to leave behind sufficient forces to defend the Seven Heroes Pass.</p><p>The forces dispatched to the Cloudsea Great Marsh were not the Small Cold Realm's full strength, yet they could match the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.</p><p>From this perspective, if not for being restrained by the spiritual tides of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the overall strength of the Small Cold Realm would surpass the Heavenly Mandate Alliance. Yet, before any signs of the spiritual tides appeared, the Small Cold Realm hadn't taken the initiative to invade the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.</p><p>The same was true now. After Stargazing Isle relocated to the Chaotic Isles, it hadn't advanced further. Qin Sang couldn't sense any aggressive posture from the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Despite the stalemate, fighting never ceased. However, both sides no longer committed their full forces, and large-scale battles involving thousands of cultivators became rare.</p><p>A strange tacit understanding seemed to have formed between the Small Cold Realm and the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.  They only dispatched their Foundation Establishment cultivators, forming teams to roam these vast waters, hunting each other.</p><p>The orders they received were vague – patrol the area, report any unusual spatial fluctuations immediately, and a handsome reward would be given.</p><p>But they weren't told what kind of fluctuations to look for.</p><p>Even the Golden Core cultivators of both sides couldn't stay out of the conflict. Every few days, they would engage in combat.  Fortunately, the fights generally remained within the same cultivation level, with rarely any instances of higher-level cultivators bullying lower ones.</p><p>Qin Sang paid close attention to the battles between Golden Core experts because he needed to assess their strength.  Whenever possible, he would find a way to observe.</p><p>Although the fights between Golden Core cultivators weren't as earth-shattering as the battle between the Thunder Swallowing Falcon and the two Nascent Soul grandmasters, they were still terrifying, affecting a wide area.  Observers had to be cautious, or they could easily become collateral damage.</p><p>Over the past three years, Qin Sang had witnessed many such battles while ensuring his own safety, gaining a certain understanding of the strength of Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Their power was indeed formidable, with distinct differences between early, mid, and late stages.</p><p>Besides cultivation level, magical treasures were also an important criterion for measuring a Golden Core cultivator's strength.</p><p>A mysterious, high-quality magical treasure could give a significant advantage in battle, keeping the opponent constantly on the defensive and even compensating for differences in cultivation level.</p><p>However, magical treasures above mid-grade were extremely rare. More than ninety percent of the treasures Qin Sang had seen were low-grade, comparable to his Ebony Sword.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was somewhat limited by his own cultivation, so his insights might not be entirely accurate.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, the battles between Golden Core cultivators resembled duels.</p><p>Most ended with one side retreating with severe injuries.  Even in the fiercest battles, only the physical body was lost, with the primordial spirit and Golden Core escaping successfully.</p><p>In short, in all the battles Qin Sang observed, not a single Golden Core cultivator truly perished.</p><p>As for the Nascent Soul grandmasters of both sides, they hadn't shown themselves since the war began.</p><p>Both the Small Cold Realm and the Heavenly Mandate Alliance seemed to be waiting for a certain moment to arrive.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if this war, which seemed so perilous and life-threatening to them, was merely a game to the higher-level cultivators.</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head helplessly. After flying out of the Sea of Mists and confirming his direction, he steered his Netherworld Cloud over the Chaotic Isles and landed on an inconspicuous rocky isle.</p><p>The isle was square, flat, and barren, devoid of vegetation. It was essentially a single, large, bluish-black reef.  Unfortunately, it was only about seven meters wide and long. A stone house built upon it left little space to stand.</p><p>In the Chaotic Isles, this isle was considered quite small, but Qin Sang had already stayed here for three years.</p><p>The stone house was his cave dwelling.</p><p>After opening the cave's restrictions and confirming no one had intruded, Qin Sang entered, skillfully sealing the restrictions behind him.  He then retrieved several spirit stones from his Mustard Seed Bag and placed them at various points within the cave.</p><p>As the spirit stones embedded themselves into the ground with a crisp clinking sound, the faint glow of a spirit array illuminated the cave, and the spiritual energy within gradually became richer.</p><p>Simultaneously, the spirit stones on the ground slowly dimmed, a sign that their spiritual power was being drawn out.</p><p>The original Chaotic Isles were incredibly barren, possessing only one hidden spirit vein, occupied by Pei Qin.</p><p>Through some unknown method, after the Truewater Mirage Formation enveloped the Chaotic Isles, the spiritual energy here improved, but it was still insufficient for so many cultivators.</p><p>Under these circumstances, no one dared to establish their cave outside the Truewater Mirage Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's cave location was relatively good, but for his cultivation level, the spiritual energy was still too thin, requiring the aid of spirit stones for cultivation.</p><p>This made cultivation quite costly, but Qin Sang had adapted.</p><p>He even felt a sense of enjoyment in it.</p><p>The spoils of war obtained from hunting enemies belonged to him, providing enough to sustain his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't stingy with his spirit stones, setting up the best spirit-gathering formation to maximize the spiritual energy within his cave. His sole objective was to cultivate as quickly as possible and reach the Pseudo Core Formation realm!</p>
