<h1>Chapter 674: Tian Wu Island</h1><p>Qin Sang activated the teleportation talisman as instructed. A shimmering barrier enveloped her body, and the ancient teleportation array blazed with light, initiating the familiar process.  Her previous two experiences using the ancient teleportation arrays at Shangyuan Quiet Palace had been disorienting, to say the least; the experience at Ziwei Palace was even worse, resulting in a lost arm.  This time, however, the journey was remarkably smooth, lacking the usual discomfort.  She landed steadily, the teleportation complete and surprisingly uneventful.</p><p>Qin Sang and Elder Zou, along with the others, materialized in a spacious hall. As the array's glow faded, they saw several menacing-looking Wu tribe guards standing before them.</p><p>While Qin Sang observed her surroundings, Elder Zou led the way out of the hall.  Qin Sang quickly followed.  Upon exiting, the view opened dramatically.</p><p>The teleportation array was situated on a mountaintop on Tian Wu Island.  A large city lay at the foot of the mountain, visible in its entirety from the hall.  Tian Wu Island lived up to its reputation; its vastness dwarfed the city, which occupied only a small portion of the island.  Beyond the city walls, rolling hills and mountains stretched towards the horizon, finally giving way to the boundless ocean.</p><p>While in the western borderlands of the Wu God Continent, Qin Sang had inquired about the Stormy Demon Sea, receiving a variety of conflicting accounts. Some claimed the seawater was blood-red and emitted a pungent odor; others spoke of constantly patrolling demonic beasts, assuring anyone who dared enter immediate annihilation.</p><p>The rumors painted the Stormy Demon Sea as a veritable hellscape. However, the ocean here appeared no different from the Canglang Sea.  After observing for a while, Qin Sang saw no demonic beasts, only the occasional streak of light from passing cultivators.</p><p>"I'll go visit some friends and gather information," Elder Zou announced to the group, turning back. "Ran Luo, you should take the others for a stroll around the city. There are quite a few interesting things to be found. Many uncharted islands in the Demon Sea often yield rare treasures lacking in the Canglang Sea, mostly accumulating on islands like Da Huang Island and Tian Wu Island. You might find something useful."</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred at the mention of rare treasures. If she could acquire Wan Shi Zhang here, she wouldn't need to search endlessly.  Her spirit stones were plentiful; if necessary, she could even part with some Jin Lan Grass.</p><p>Ran Luo responded affirmatively.</p><p>As Elder Zou and the Wu tribe cultivator were about to depart, he paused, seeming to recall something. He pointed towards the two peaks flanking them. "These two places are forbidden zones on Tian Wu Island.  Many Nascent Soul masters are in seclusion on those mountains; avoid entering without reason. The mountain on the left houses the Nascent Soul masters of our human race; the right one is for the Wu tribe."</p><p>"So many human Nascent Soul cultivators on Tian Wu Island?" Qin Sang turned to the left peak.</p><p>Both mountains were undeniably blessed spots,  adorned with exquisite pavilions and halls nestled amongst lush greenery and clear springs. The spiritual energy was exceptionally dense. Qin Sang was certain that these two mountains occupied the most advantageous positions on the island's spiritual veins.</p><p>What surprised her was the apparent number of human Nascent Soul cultivators, judging by Elder Zou's words.</p><p>Humans and the Wu tribe had reluctantly united to combat the demonic races in the Demon Sea, but the underlying tension remained. Otherwise, the slightest Wu tribe movement would not send the human cultivators of the Wu God Continent into a panic, scrambling to escape.</p><p>Even within the Demon Sea, the divide couldn't be entirely erased.  While the presence of human Nascent Soul cultivators on Tian Wu Island, the Wu tribe's stronghold, wasn't entirely unexpected, the tribe's tolerance of their presence was peculiar.</p><p>Elder Zou murmured, "I shared your same bewilderment when I first arrived in the Demon Sea. Later, I heard rumors that the teleportation array built by the Wu tribe was somehow connected to our human powerhouses. Since the founding of Tian Wu Island, human Nascent Soul masters have been stationed on this mountain. The precise reason, however, remains unknown…"</p><p>After Elder Zou left,</p><p>Qin Sang and the others descended the mountain and entered the city, quickly discovering that Tian Wu Island differed greatly from their expectations.  They had often heard tales of the Demon Sea's perils, with Canglang Sea cultivators believing only Golden Core cultivators ventured there to hunt demons; only the boldest or most desperate Foundation Establishment cultivators risked their lives to enter.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, the city teemed with not only Golden Core cultivators, but also numerous Foundation Establishment and Qi Condensation cultivators, and even a sizable population of commoners.  It was indistinguishable from any city in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Daoist Huiwen, seemingly a first-time visitor to the Demon Sea as well, looked around curiously, equally perplexed.</p><p>"What's so strange about that?"</p><p>Ran Luo said, "These people aren't teleported here. They're the descendants of cultivators who entered the Demon Sea long ago. Some lacked talent, most didn't even have spiritual roots, and they couldn't afford the spirit stones for teleportation, so they could only struggle to make a living in the Demon Sea. You'll see when we leave the island; there are many islands outside Tian Wu Island without spirit veins, where ordinary people live in villages.  A similar situation exists on Da Huang Island. In fact, even on the stable, larger islands like Du Yan Island, there are many ordinary people and low-level cultivators."</p><p>"Aren't they afraid of the demonic beasts? Those ordinary people wouldn't be able to defend themselves, would Tian Wu Island send people to protect them?" Hui Wen asked.</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head. "Tian Wu Island and Da Huang Island are different from other islands. Except for the initial period when they were established and suffered attacks from demonic beasts, as the cultivators' territories expanded, the demonic beasts around these two islands have been mostly eliminated. Even at the most critical times, these two islands remained very stable. However, some accidents are inevitable. Occasionally, a demonic beast might blunder in, and if the patrolling cultivators can't deal with it in time..."</p><p>Ran Luo didn't continue, but Qin Sang and the others understood what would happen.</p><p>The law of the jungle prevailed. Tian Wu Island certainly wouldn't want to invest too many resources in ordinary people, they could only hope the patrolling cultivators would do their duty.</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at a large area of buildings, some stone, some wood, with many cultivators coming and going.</p><p>Ran Luo entered the frontmost building, and soon came out, sighing, "Bad luck, the Grand Auction won't start for another month. We probably won't be able to make it. These buildings sell various treasures. Let's try to find anything we need ourselves, and meet at the city gate tonight to see Elder Zou."</p><p>The Grand Auction was Tian Wu Island's biggest event, with countless treasures, held every three months.  They had hoped to see it, but the timing was wrong.</p><p>Qin Sang had the same intention. After Ran Luo's explanation, she took her leave and entered a building alone.</p><p>This building mainly sold materials for refining weapons and elixirs. As soon as Qin Sang entered, several maids' eyes lit up. One of the most beautiful maids gracefully approached her.</p>
