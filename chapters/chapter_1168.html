<h1>Chapter 1160: An Unexpected Turn</h1><p>Seeing that Qin Sang had not come to settle any grudges, the Sect Master of Yuanzhao Sect breathed a sigh of relief. He dared not conceal anything from Qin Sang and answered honestly, "Reporting to Senior, when we were attacked by the Ghost Yin Sect, we suffered heavy losses. The reason we were able to counterattack was due to the intervention of the disciples from the Wuji Sect. After breaking through the Ghost Yin Sect's mountain-protecting formation, most of their treasures fell into the hands of the Wuji Sect disciples."</p><p>"Did the Wuji Sect take all of the Ten Directions Yama Banners, the renowned treasures of the Ghost Yin Ancestor during his lifetime?" Qin Sang pressed further.</p><p>So it was for the Ten Directions Yama Banners...</p><p>The Sect Master of Yuanzhao Sect was surprised that someone still remembered this matter after so long. He maintained a calm expression, pondering as he spoke, "Back then, after we jointly killed Yi Tiannie, the Sect Master of Ghost Yin Sect, we found one Ten Directions Yama Banner among his belongings. It was taken by Ying Jiansheng of the Wuji Sect. As for the other Golden Core cultivator who died under Ying Jiansheng's sword, we have no idea if he possessed a Yama Banner. Another Golden Core cultivator used a trick to escape with his primordial spirit during the battle, and we have heard nothing of him since... It is said that Ying Jiansheng later found some damaged Yama Banners, which he also took back to the Wuji Sect."</p><p>This was more or less what Qin Sang had expected. Since the Wuji Sect had intervened, they would not leave any good treasures for the Yuanzhao Sect. This made things more complicated.</p><p>The Wuji Sect had been destroyed over a hundred years ago, its disciples either dead or scattered, and its treasures divided among various major factions. It was unclear who now possessed the Yama Banners. Even if he found them, attempting to trade for them would likely result in exorbitant demands.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang continued, "When the Wuji Sect was destroyed, was Ying Jiansheng also implicated?"</p><p>The Sect Master of Yuanzhao Sect nodded, "It is said that on the night the Wuji Sect was destroyed, all of the Sect Master's direct disciples were killed, including Ying Jiansheng. None escaped."</p><p>"So, your Yuanzhao Sect didn't obtain a single Yama Banner?" Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, and a hint of coldness crept into his voice.</p><p>He clearly remembered that back at the foot of Yuanzhao Peak, Zhao Yan had used a demonic banner to trap the cultivators guarding the Nine Illusions Heavenly Orchid. After Qin Sang killed Zhao Yan, he had not dared to touch the banner and left it there. That banner must have fallen into the hands of the Yuanzhao Sect, yet the Sect Master had not mentioned it. If he dared to deceive him, Qin Sang would not hesitate to teach him a lesson.</p><p>The Sect Master of Yuanzhao Sect's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly replied, "Junior has not finished speaking. Yi Tiannie sent someone to infiltrate our sect with a demonic banner, which was obtained by one of our disciples. It was not handed over to the Wuji Sect. However, this banner is no longer in my possession. It was later taken by a senior."</p><p>"Who?" Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>The Sect Master of Yuanzhao Sect looked troubled and shook his head, "Junior does not know the identity of that senior. After the Wuji Sect was destroyed, she came to demand the banner, promising to protect our sect from being implicated by the Wuji Sect. Junior's cultivation is low, and I have never seen her since. To this day, I do not know her identity."</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. "Was this person not from a righteous sect? Do you remember her appearance?"</p><p>"That senior was a female cultivator, dressed in a red robe..." the Sect Master described.</p><p>The more Qin Sang listened, the more astonished he became. The person the Sect Master described was none other than Senior Sister Qingjun! It was no wonder the Sect Master had not heard of her. Very few knew her true identity, as she had been disguising herself as Leng Yuntian all these years.</p><p>"So, the other Yama Banners are also in Senior Sister Qingjun's hands? Why is she collecting them? Could it be that she has heard of the legends surrounding the Ghost Yin Ancestor and is interested in the power of these banners?" Qin Sang wondered to himself.</p><p>If it was Senior Sister Qingjun, then the matter would be much easier to handle.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Sect Master of Yuanzhao Sect and asked a few more questions, all of which the Sect Master answered truthfully. Seeing that the man was being honest and not hiding anything, Qin Sang decided not to press him further. After obtaining the information he needed, he summoned his escape light and departed.</p><p>The Sect Master of Yuanzhao Sect watched Qin Sang disappear into the distance with an expression of utmost respect. Only after Qin Sang was out of sight did he feel as though he had survived a great calamity. Wiping the cold sweat from his forehead, his expression shifted uneasily as he muttered, "A Nascent Soul Ancestor personally came to question me. How could I dare hide anything? Thankfully, that senior did not strictly forbid us from speaking of this. I must be careful not to stir up any trouble..."</p><p>Qin Sang paid no mind to the Sect Master's thoughts. After leaving the Yuanzhao Sect, he flew eastward, heading toward his next destination: the Demon Flame Sect.</p><p>He did not dwell too long on Senior Sister Qingjun's motives. He could simply ask her directly the next time they met. What intrigued him more was her cultivation level.</p><p>The destruction of the Wuji Sect had occurred at a clear point in time. After the closure of the Purple Micro Palace, the experts of the Cold Domain had immediately targeted the Wuji Sect. It was around that time that Senior Sister Qingjun had approached the Yuanzhao Sect.</p><p>Before entering the Purple Micro Palace, Senior Sister Qingjun had asked him to assist her with the Blood Filth Divine Light to deal with Leng Yuntian. Yet, after emerging from the palace, she had become a Nascent Soul Ancestor. The speed of her breakthrough was alarmingly fast.</p><p>Could she have undergone her Heavenly Tribulation within the Purple Micro Palace?</p><p>Qin Sang had always felt that something was off about Senior Sister Qingjun. Her realm and strength seemed contradictory. Despite her extraordinary beauty, she had disguised herself as Granny Jing, which was even more peculiar. Now, it seemed his instincts had been correct.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Senior Sister Qingjun had already formed her Nascent Soul before entering the Purple Micro Palace. However, for some reason, her cultivation had been restricted, preventing her from unleashing her full power. After eliminating Leng Yuntian, she had found a way to resolve this within the Purple Micro Palace, restoring her cultivation and rising to become a top-tier expert. Even the Red-Haired Ancestor was wary of her, tacitly allowing her to seize control of the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>"Calculating it this way, Senior Sister Qingjun's cultivation speed is truly astonishing. Her talent might not be inferior to Chen Yan's. After all, her parents—one disappeared, and the other died early—left her with a deep-seated vendetta. She never joined any sect, and her circumstances were barely better than those of a rogue cultivator. Chen Yan, on the other hand, had the support of Dongyang Bo and Shaohua Mountain, yet still resorted to demonic arts to forcibly form her Nascent Soul."</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more he realized how extraordinary Senior Sister Qingjun was. Unlike him, who had the advantage of a convenient cultivation method with no bottlenecks in the minor realms, her achievements were truly remarkable.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang flew swiftly, barely stopping, until he entered the territory of the Heavenly Severance Mountains. Here, he had entered the domain of the demonic path.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to discreetly gather information about the Qingyang Demon Sect, so he maintained a low profile. With his cultivation level, ordinary people would not be able to see through his disguise.</p><p>As the war loomed, cultivators were being dispatched to the frontlines, and the markets were noticeably quieter, with fewer people around.</p><p>Qin Sang first visited the demonic cultivator city of Tianyou Pass, where he gathered some information before heading south. After several stops, he arrived near the Demon Flame Sect.</p><p>On a deserted mountain peak, Qin Sang silently appeared, turning the Thousand Jun Ring on his finger as he gazed toward the direction of the Demon Flame Sect. The sect's mountain gate remained in its original location, having not moved.</p><p>"Although the Demon Flame Sect is located in demonic territory, their cultivation techniques are based on absorbing earth fire and are not demonic in nature. If the sect's ethos is acceptable, there would be no harm in taking them under my wing..."</p><p>******</p>
