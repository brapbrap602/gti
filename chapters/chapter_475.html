<h1>Chapter 468: Landscape and Hidden Moon Painting</h1><p>Before the Yuanchen Sect's leader arrived, these three individuals were not to be underestimated. The handsome young man was at least at the Core Formation realm, while the elder and the plainly dressed young man were undoubtedly Golden Core masters.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He couldn't tell if Granny Jing had deliberately dragged him into this mess or if it was just a coincidence that they had arrived just as the three from Yuanchen Sect entered.</p><p>Qin Sang preferred to believe Granny Jing was unintentional.</p><p>He hadn't been able to leave in time and had been seen by the three from Yuanchen Sect.  It was clearly impossible for him to remain uninvolved.</p><p>Not to mention that Elder Palmstar had already wanted him dead.  If even one of these three escaped alive, he would have no way to defend himself.  He would be an enemy of a Nascent Soul grandmaster and the Yuanchen Sect, one of the eight righteous sects.</p><p>He might even be seen as a traitor by the entire Xiaohan Region for conspiring with Granny Jing to enter Fingerpeak Mountain.</p><p>Any of these consequences were unbearable for Qin Sang.</p><p>It seemed there was only one choice left...</p><p>"Who are you, to dare speak to the Sect Leader with such disrespect!"</p><p>Elder Palmstar shouted coldly, his face grim, staring intently at Granny Jing.</p><p>The two young men beside him were similarly enraged, about to attack, but Elder Palmstar stopped them with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Granny Jing's tone and demeanor were clearly hostile, giving Elder Palmstar a bad feeling and making him extremely wary.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was secretly puzzled. Granny Jing was so mysterious that even Elder Palmstar didn't recognize her. Could she truly be a Nascent Soul grandmaster?</p><p>He wondered why Granny Jing had a grudge against Leng Yuntian, risking her life and meticulously planning to ambush him within Fingerpeak Mountain.</p><p>Granny Jing calmly brushed her eyebrows, ignoring Elder Palmstar's questioning. Disregarding the handsome young man, her gaze fell upon the elder and the plainly dressed young man. She said indifferently, "Elder Palmstar, Yu Shanting, the two elders of Yuanchen Sect, Leng Yuntian's right and left hands. Since you are so loyal to Leng Yuntian, you surely won't complain about paying off a debt for him..."</p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>The three from Yuanchen Sect roared in fury.</p><p>Elder Palmstar's white hair danced wildly, his silver robe billowing, creating a hurricane.  Amidst the flying sand and stones, he rose into the air, transforming into a miniature starry sky, stars shining brightly.</p><p>This silver robe was clearly a magical treasure.  Standing at the edge of the square, Qin Sang couldn't discern its grade.</p><p>Because Elder Palmstar's cultivation was suppressed to the Core Formation realm, it was impossible for him to unleash the treasure's full power.</p><p>Even so, the silver robe was not to be underestimated. The starry sky enveloped the entire square, leaving no gaps, but it didn't touch the restrictions outside the square.</p><p>As a renowned Golden Core cultivator, a late-stage Golden Core master, Elder Palmstar's combat experience was undoubtedly vast.  He could tell at a glance that the restrictions outside were not to be trifled with.</p><p>With the starry sky manifested, Elder Palmstar pointed a finger towards the heavens, manipulating the stars.</p><p>In an instant, thousands of starlight beams burst forth, converging into a dazzling pillar of light, carrying endless killing intent, descending from the sky, about to fall upon Granny Jing.</p><p>A glimpse into a leopard's spots reveals its whole body.</p><p>This wasn't the first time Qin Sang had witnessed Golden Core cultivators battling. Very few were as effortless as Elder Palmstar.  His true strength must have been terrifying.</p><p>Meanwhile, the plainly dressed young man, Yu Shanting, his face ashen, had a bronze bell floating above his head. Purple energy swirled within the bell, its exterior flashing with yellow light, complementing the starlight.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The purple energy within the bell churned, followed by a deafening roar. This bell toll could shake one's mind, causing Qin Sang's heart to tremble violently.  He felt a pang of discomfort.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Visible sound waves rippled out from the bell, along with a surge of purple energy, transforming into a thousand crashing waves, clashing equally with the pillar of light conjured by Elder Palmstar.</p><p>Although their cultivation was suppressed to the Core Formation realm, they weren't restricted in using their magical treasures.  They could still utilize their treasures, even if the treasures' power was greatly diminished, it was still stronger than magical artifacts.</p><p>Compared to them, the sword energy unleashed by the handsome young man seemed insignificant, completely overshadowed by the two magical treasures.</p><p>Facing the triple attack, Granny Jing's eyes remained calm.  She extended a jade-like finger, lightly pointing upwards. A scroll unfurled from her fingertip.</p><p>The scroll spun rapidly, growing larger and larger until it reached three feet in length, slowly unfolding in mid-air.</p><p>A landscape painting with a hidden moon appeared before everyone's eyes.</p><p>The painting depicted a vast landscape, the artistry exquisite, capturing its essence.  Above the landscape, a sea of clouds stretched endlessly, and within this sea of clouds, a single moon hung.</p><p>It wasn't like the bright, silver moon in the night sky, but a subtly hidden moon, sketched with simple lines, almost indiscernible.</p><p>The sun had not yet set, and the moon was just rising.</p><p>This seemingly inconspicuous hidden moon suddenly brightened as the scroll fully unfurled, transforming into a true moon, detaching from the painting and rising slowly.</p><p>The moon blocked the impact of the bronze bell, resisted the descending starlight, and ascended, finally embedding itself within the night sky conjured by the silver robe.</p><p>At this moment, this moon became the focal point, outshining the myriad stars.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>Elder Palmstar's eyes were filled with shock, unable to resist asking again.</p><p>Granny Jing remained silent, taking out a wooden carving with her left hand.</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>With a clear cry, a Green鸾 bird soared from Granny Jing's palm, its wings flapping as it flew straight towards the sword energy unleashed by the handsome young man. It opened its beak, spitting out a stream of green energy that collided precisely with the sword energy, neutralizing and annihilating each other.</p><p>The Green鸾's speed increased, like an arrow leaving the bowstring, diving straight towards the handsome young man.</p><p>Noticing the Green鸾's unusual nature, Yu Shanting flashed in front of the handsome young man. The bronze bell vibrated once more, its sound echoing. A ferocious beast emerged from the purple energy, resembling a Qilin, menacing and fierce.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The beast roared furiously.</p><p>Amidst the purple sound waves, the beast flickered in and out of existence, almost merging with the bell's sound waves, forming a wave even stronger than before, instantly rushing towards the Green鸾.</p><p>The Green鸾 raised its noble head, a hint of disdain flashing in its intelligent eyes.  Its wings flapped, and it suddenly vanished, leaving only specks of green light.</p><p>In the next moment, the Green鸾 appeared above the beast, its talons plunging downwards, tearing through the beast's head.</p><p>With a whimper, the beast perished instantly, its arrogant roar abruptly cut short.  Its body convulsed, then vanished along with the scattered sound waves.</p><p>The Green鸾, relentless, its figure like lightning, changed its target, diving straight towards Yu Shanting.</p><p>Yu Shanting's face darkened.  He quickly formed a complex hand seal, the bronze bell spinning.  This time, three streams of purple energy shot out.</p><p>They didn't transform into beasts, but directly materialized into a purple blade, radiating killing intent, flashing like a streak of purple light, slashing towards the back of the Green鸾's neck.</p><p>At the same time, Yu Shanting glanced grimly at Granny Jing and shouted to the handsome young man, "I'll deal with this demonic bird.  Go help Elder Palmstar!"</p><p>The handsome young man's cultivation was the weakest, far from comparable to the three masters.  However, since everyone was restricted to the Foundation Establishment realm, the handsome young man, as support, could still play a significant role, distracting their opponent.</p>
