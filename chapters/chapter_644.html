Chapter 636: Longing for Xiao Hanyu


“No, no…”
Cui Xuanzi shook his head repeatedly, unsure of Qin Sang's meaning, and stroked his beard with a smile. “I would be overjoyed if you were to join the Five Venom Sect, but I fear my humble abode is too simple for your discerning eyes.”
Unexpectedly, Ya Gu stood up, walked to Cui Xuanzi, and knelt down. “Disciple greets Master!”
Qin Sang did not stop her, sighing inwardly.
Ya Gu was clever and understood his meaning.
Becoming Cui Xuanzi's disciple in his presence was probably the best choice. Ya Gu's decisiveness was commendable.
…
After settling Ya Gu in, Qin Sang and Cui Xuanzi discussed the important matter.
“As per your instructions, Senior, I contacted many friends and did my best to investigate. However, most of them found nothing…”
Cui Xuanzi looked embarrassed.
“I know a manager of a trading company. This company has a mysterious origin, with business spanning half of the Western Frontier and access to extensive information. According to him, in the past two hundred years, there has only been one Nascent Soul cultivator in the Western Frontier. Even then, it was after leaving the Western Frontier, betraying their sect, and joining a major sect outside that they achieved Nascent Soul.  Sword cultivators are rare among our Wu Clan, even more so in the Western Frontier. There isn't a single one matching your description, Senior. Even outside the Western Frontier, I haven't heard of a Nascent Soul Grandmaster named Qing Zhu.”
Qin Sang frowned. Senior Qing Zhu was known as the Sword Demon in Xiao Hanyu, immersed in the Dao of Slaughter, with such a unique swordsmanship. If he had been in the Western Frontier back then, even a single public appearance would have made him memorable.
Yet there was no information at all.
Cultivating the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" required participation in slaughter and comprehension of the Dao of Slaughter, making it difficult to remain inconspicuous.
Could it be that Senior Qing Zhu had a teleportation mishap and died unexpectedly?
Qin Sang shook his head, finding it too absurd.
“What about the others?”
Cui Xuanzi said, “I also asked him to help acquire the Eternal Camphorwood and Soul Guiding Grass. My friend had heard of them. But according to him, both of these are extraordinary treasures. Even the trading company has no record of acquiring them. Finding them in the Western Frontier is a fool's errand. In fact…”
Hesitating, Cui Xuanzi carefully observed Qin Sang’s expression.  “As far as he knows, spiritual materials and herbs of this level are rare even in the entire Boundless Sea.  Finding them would depend entirely on luck, Senior.”
Hearing this, Qin Sang’s eyes flickered in surprise.
The Eternal Camphorwood being rare was understandable; it was an extraordinary treasure.
But why was the Soul Guiding Grass also so scarce?
In Xiao Hanyu, although rare, Soul Guiding Grass occasionally appeared in demonic sect auctions, used by demonic cultivators to aid their cultivation.
The Boundless Sea was vast, a single Wu God Continent could be equivalent to several Xiao Hanyu.
The trading company manager dared to say that Soul Guiding Grass was rare in the entire Boundless Sea.
Unless he was ignorant and spouting nonsense…
A sense of foreboding rose in Qin Sang’s heart.  He asked in a serious tone, “Your friend is knowledgeable and should hold a high position in the trading company, right? Does he have any connections to acquire Core Formation assisting pills? I want to buy them for my sect's juniors. Price is not an issue.”
“Core Formation assisting pills?”
Cui Xuanzi smiled wryly.  “To be honest, Senior, I had similar thoughts before. Later, I inquired with the manager and learned that such miraculous medicines, even if they only slightly aid Core Formation, would attract countless factions vying for them whenever they appear, even among the human race. They are even rarer among our Wu Clan. How could they possibly appear in the Western Frontier?”
Hearing this, Qin Sang finally realized the problem.
It seemed that the Boundless Sea region was far more barren than Xiao Hanyu!
Xiao Hanyu had ancient immortal battlefields, where ancient secret realms were occasionally unearthed. Sometimes, with good luck, one could even find an entire herb garden, with precious spiritual objects frequently appearing.
For example, regarding Core Formation assisting objects, Shaohua Mountain alone could provide a Kanli Golden Core for each of its Foundation Establishment disciples. Other righteous sects and demonic sects wouldn't be much different.
Only heavenly treasures like Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower were truly scarce.
Qin Sang had suffered greatly during Core Formation and knew how difficult it was.  Without Core Formation assisting medicines, how low would the Core Formation rate be for human cultivators in the Boundless Sea?
The Wu Clan had their natal Gu insects.  Did the human race have other methods?
Cultivating in such a barren place, what kind of future could there be? Qin Sang suddenly missed Xiao Hanyu immensely.
However, he had only heard Cui Xuanzi's side of the story; seeing was believing.
Qin Sang's heart was stirred, but his expression remained unchanged.
Cui Xuanzi continued, "The Scorching Sparrow demon beast that Senior inquired about isn't found in the Western Frontier either. However, the manager mentioned rumors of Scorching Sparrows appearing in the Stormy Sea Region. Senior could search there…"
Cui Xuanzi spoke quickly, detailing all the information he had gathered, and then handed Qin Sang a jade slip.
The jade slip contained a simplified map covering most of the Western Frontier, with sporadic markings of long-standing dangerous and secret realms, exactly what Qin Sang wanted.
However, these locations were all in the heartland of the Western Frontier. Could he have drifted from such a distant place? Qin Sang wondered.
In addition, there were a few rumored locations of insect nests, which Cui Xuanzi had gathered based on the Strange Insect List Qin Sang had given him.
Qin Sang's eyes brightened. This resource-scarce land actually had quite a few strange insects, ones not found in Xiao Hanyu.
He hadn't decided which strange insect to choose as his natal Gu. Each strange insect possessed extraordinary abilities, and Qin Sang found them all suitable.
However, these strange insects, with their unique talents, were well-hidden, elusive and difficult to find.  Moreover, these were just rumors; whether or not he could capture them was still uncertain.
"Good work, you've been diligent…"
Qin Sang nodded, then suddenly frowned, turning his head to look outside the hall.
He saw dozens of multicolored streaks of light, coming from between the mountains outside the Five Venom Sect, rushing towards them with imposing momentum.
Only then did Cui Xuanzi sense the commotion outside.  He flashed out of the hall, and his face changed drastically upon seeing the aggressive uninvited guests.
"All disciples, heed my command! Activate the mountain protection formation!"
Cui Xuanzi yelled urgently.
The Five Venom Sect disciples, also aware of the situation, flew out from the mountains in panic.
'Boom!'
All the peaks stirred, emitting dazzling beams of light that converged in the air, forming an actual lotus flower.
A burst of arrogant laughter echoed from outside.  "Old Cui Xuanzi, esteemed guests have arrived. Instead of coming out to greet us, you activate your mountain protection formation. Is this your way of hospitality?"
Qin Sang remained seated in the hall, taking a sip of tea.
