<h1>Chapter 495: The Iron Ring</h1><p>Carefully placing Jiupao Dao Ren's golden core into a jade box and sealing it, Qin Sang couldn't help but show a delighted expression, letting out a long sigh of relief.  This journey, though fraught with peril, had achieved its primary objective.</p><p>Putting away the golden core, Qin Sang picked up the iron ring. He was immediately surprised by its unexpected weight; it was clearly no ordinary object.  Examining it closely, he found no markings, inside or out. The rust was concentrated on the interior, almost forming a single, continuous layer.  He couldn't determine how this rust had formed, and even his spirit-infused blade couldn't remove it.</p><p>He used his spiritual sense to scan the ring, but found nothing unusual.  It seemed to be a simple iron ring made of Xuan iron.</p><p>Had he been wrong? Did the ring hold some special significance for Jiupao Dao Ren?  Qin Sang frowned, unconvinced that a man on the run would carry a mundane ring.</p><p>Suddenly, an idea struck him.  He turned the ring over, focusing on the internal rust.  He carefully probed it with his spiritual sense, meticulously examining every inch.</p><p>After a moment, his expression shifted.  His spiritual sense seemed to touch a certain point, and with a "boom," he was pulled into a chaotic space.</p><p>Before he could comprehend his surroundings, a blinding light erupted within the space. The light's source was a blade, which slashed towards his spiritual sense with incredible speed.  The blade's edge was instantly upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, withdrawing his spiritual sense.  But the blade, unexpectedly, shot out of the ring, following the trajectory of his spiritual sense, and slashed at Qin Sang!</p><p>The thin blade possessed an incredibly sharp edge, almost making Qin Sang break into a cold sweat. A thunderclap echoed.</p><p>Instinctively, Qin Sang dropped the ring, transforming into a sword light and using Sword Qi Thunder Sound to escape several meters away, finally evading the blade.  He looked at the ring with a complex expression.</p><p>The blade's energy was clearly Jiupao Dao Ren's; a spiritual restriction he’d left within the ring.  Even in death, the restriction remained, instantly attacking anyone who triggered it.</p><p>Picking up the ring again, Qin Sang was now prepared. He tested it several times, discovering that the restriction wasn't unbreakable.  Since the owner was dead, it shouldn't require the same level of power as Jiupao Dao Ren to overcome it.  He simply wasn't capable of it yet.</p><p>Unable to unlock the restriction, Qin Sang couldn't determine the ring's function.  However, the chaotic space felt strangely familiar, somewhat resembling a spatial pouch.  Could the ring also be used for storage?</p><p>He pondered this. If it were a powerful artifact, Jiupao Dao Ren would have used it against him. This seemed likely.  Perhaps Jiupao Dao Ren's entire fortune was inside the ring!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened.  Ji Wu's spatial pouch had been destroyed in the final explosion. He'd assumed Jiupao Dao Ren's was also lost, but this was an unexpected find.  Regardless of the treasures within, the ring itself was far more discreet than a spatial pouch.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was locked! Qin Sang sighed.  Judging by the strength of the restriction, he'd probably need to reach the Golden Core stage to open it, and he certainly couldn't ask for help.</p><p>Still, he suspected that Jiupao Dao Ren didn't have many valuables left.  He’d been a fugitive, hunted relentlessly by the Yuanzhao Sect for years.  He only survived by hiding, waiting for an opportune moment, probably only for a few years before his death.  He couldn't even appear in public, only sending his subordinates to act.  Of his Four Demon Flame Envoys, only Ji Wu remained after the death of Yin Yan.</p><p>During this period, Jiupao Dao Ren was in hiding, recovering from injuries and repairing his Ten Directions Yama Banner; even considerable wealth couldn't withstand such depletion.  The recent battle clearly demonstrated this: he only relied on the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>Thinking of the banner, Qin Sang put away the ring, then stood and searched the area.  He found Jiupao Dao Ren's Ten Directions Yama Banner buried in the sand.  Three of the five Ten Directions Yama Banners passed down from Kuiyin Old Ancestor were now in Qin Sang's possession.  All three Golden Core cultivators of the Kuiyin Sect were dead, as were the remaining Foundation Establishment Late-Stage cultivators.</p><p>It can be said that the legacy of Kuiyin Laozhu, the master of demons, is completely severed!</p><p>The banner of the Ten Directions Yama Banner was torn by Feitian Yecha, though not fatally damaging the artifact itself.  Repairing it won't be difficult.</p><p>However, like Yu Hua's banner, it will have to wait until Qin Sang forms his Golden Core.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang, dragging his weary body, came before the rock wall and pulled out Feitian Yecha.</p><p>Its limbs were twisted, its wounds countless, with pale bone fragments visible everywhere.</p><p>The most serious injury was to its dantian; its qi sea was nearly destroyed, and its Corpse Pill was covered in cracks. Fortunately, the Corpse Pill wasn't completely shattered and there's still a chance of saving it.</p><p>Witnessing Feitian Yecha's condition, Qin Sang sighed softly, then felt a sense of relief. This was the best possible outcome.</p><p>Creating Feitian Yecha was incredibly difficult; Qin Sang wouldn't be confident in recreating it.</p><p>Feitian Yecha can be restored, but it will take time.  The damage to its Corpse Pill is beyond Qin Sang's ability to fix; Feitian Yecha will have to heal itself.  If left in the Corpse Puppet Bag, this process would be extremely long.</p><p>It would likely need to be placed deep within the Earth-Sinking Cave to constantly absorb earth煞 energy for the fastest recovery.</p><p>After a thorough examination, Qin Sang treated Feitian Yecha's flesh wounds and put it back into the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>The Corpse Puppet Bag was empty, containing only two Foundation Establishment mid-stage煞 corpses.</p><p>This battle nearly depleted Qin Sang's resources.</p><p>...</p><p>The moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>In Hanshan City.</p><p>The gate to the Ji family ancestral shrine was tightly shut; only Ji Sheng, the Ji family patriarch, remained inside.</p><p>The forbidden area was calm, but everyone was uneasy and afraid to investigate.  Fear spread through the family; Ji Sheng ordered everyone back to their rooms to cultivate, remaining alone in the ancestral shrine.</p><p>The shrine was quiet, candlelight flickering softly.  Ji Sheng sat, his cloudy eyes fixed on the ancestral tablets, lost in thought.</p><p>Suddenly, a gust of wind arose from nowhere.</p><p>The candlelight flickered, plunging the room into momentary darkness.</p><p>Ji Sheng sharply turned his head, startled to find a corpse puppet behind him. In the air beside the puppet, characters formed of spiritual energy floated.</p><p>"I am a former acquaintance of Ji Wu, who once aided me. This corpse possesses Foundation Establishment strength.  I leave it to the Ji family to ensure its stability for generations to come."</p><p>After Ji Sheng finished reading, the characters twisted and disappeared into thin air.</p><p>Ji Sheng's eyes widened. He abruptly stood, rushing out of the shrine.</p><p>Outside, the moon bathed the courtyard.</p><p>Stars filled the heavens.</p><p>Not a single soul was in sight.</p><p>"My son…"</p><p>Ji Sheng looked toward the forbidden area, and with a ‘thud’, knelt down, a single tear falling onto the stone steps.</p>
