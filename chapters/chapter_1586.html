<h1></h1><p>‘Crack… Crack… Crack…’</p><p>The sound of cracking ice echoed within the ice cave. The pink lightning failed to penetrate the protective罡(gang), transforming into countless electric threads that spread out, snaking towards Qin Sang's feet and seeping into the ice.</p><p>The lightning carried a terrifying corrosive power.</p><p>A large hole was instantly etched beneath Qin Sang.  Wherever the stray electric threads touched, the ice silently dissolved, the effect rippling outwards across a wide area. A large section of the ice floor collapsed.</p><p>The ice cave was a nexus of Cold煞(sha) Energy.</p><p>The Profound Ice here was imbued with Cold煞(sha) Energy.  This free-flowing Cold煞(sha) Energy was different from that within the Cold Crystals. Qin Sang speculated that the Cold煞(sha) Energy inside the crystals had been refined through a spirit array, making it directly absorbable by cultivators.</p><p>However, even impure Cold煞(sha) Energy, when solidified into Profound Ice, possessed a hardness far surpassing ordinary ice.</p><p>Being struck by the pink lightning would have been disastrous.</p><p>This demoness, attacking so ruthlessly with intent to kill, ignited fury within Qin Sang and Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways at Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had specifically inquired whether any major powers resided near the snowy plains.</p><p>Elder Yanshan had answered with absolute certainty that there were none.  In his numerous hunts for Snow Foxes within the snowy plains, he had thoroughly explored the area. No matter how much commotion he caused, no one would appear for quite some time.</p><p>That's why they felt confident breaking through the ice walls and pursuing the Snow Fox.</p><p>Yet now, a strange demoness had appeared, and her cultivation was remarkably high, also at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally labeled her a "demoness," not just to vent his anger.</p><p>Despite her ruthless actions, Qin Sang had to admit that her every frown and smile exuded an alluring charm.  He was certain it wasn't some seductive technique but a natural, captivating allure, the kind that could topple kingdoms.</p><p>“Hmph!  Quick to hide!”</p><p>Yuefei, her attack having missed, sneered and retreated to a corner of the ice cave, remaining motionless as if anticipating a counterattack.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to ask Elder Yanshan about the woman's identity when his gaze swept over her, detecting an anomaly.  His heart sank.  "Not good!"  He fiercely swung his Snowtreading Divine Saber.</p><p>Saber energy surged like a tide, slashing towards the empty space beside the Cold Crystal ice pillar.</p><p>He was a step too late.</p><p>The ice on the ground bulged slightly, and an ice pillar erupted, a perfect replica of Yuefei, frozen in ice.</p><p>The ice sculpture's eyelashes trembled slightly, and the ice transformed into real flesh and blood. Yuefei, using some unknown secret technique, had approached the Cold Crystal right under their noses.</p><p>Ignoring the saber energy behind her, Yuefei reached for the ice pillar, a pearl concealed in her palm.</p><p>The pink lightning originated from this pearl.</p><p>Crackling sounds filled the air.</p><p>Countless tiny electric threads, contained within her palm, lashed out at the ice pillar, attempting to shatter it and retrieve the Cold Crystal within.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the lightning bombarded the pillar, yet it remained unscathed.</p><p>Yuefei was taken aback. Then, she noticed the spirit array beneath her glowing brightly. The ice pillar emitted a beam of blue light, sharp as a sword, thrusting directly at her face.</p><p>An ice sword before her, a divine saber behind.</p><p>Yuefei's expression shifted rapidly.  Realizing she couldn't forcibly take the Cold Crystal, she remained composed, tossing her light veil into the air. It transformed into a colorful cloud, intending to use this magical treasure to defend against both attacks.</p><p>‘Thud! Thud!’</p><p>The ice sword and the Snowtreading Divine Saber struck in succession.</p><p>The colorful cloud first entangled the ice sword. Just as the cloud qi began to churn and crush the ice sword, the Snowtreading Divine Saber, close behind, struck its vulnerable point.</p><p>This time, the light veil couldn't withstand the force. The colorful cloud shattered, countless fragments fluttering to the ground. A superb protective magical treasure was thus destroyed.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Yuefei retreated, escaping the predicament at the cost of a magical treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang observed clearly, sudden understanding dawning upon him. The demoness’s fundamental Dao, like his avatar, was also the Ice Dao. No wonder she coveted the Cold Crystal.</p><p>“So it's a thief!”</p><p>Elder Yanshan hadn't had time to react. Seeing Yuefei approach the Cold Crystal, he was startled, but thankfully, the pillar was protected by restrictions.</p><p>The opponent was clearly unaware of these restrictions.</p><p>After the sudden surge of emotions, Elder Yanshan flew into a rage, immediately flinging the thin cord in his hand, aiming directly at Yuefei's forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang also felt irritated.</p><p>The demoness, clearly not the owner of this place, dared to initiate an attack.  She truly didn’t know the meaning of death!</p><p>“Who are you, demoness?  State your name!” Elder Yanshan roared.</p><p>The thin cord, agile as a snake, seemingly aimed at Yuefei's forehead, suddenly changed its trajectory as she moved to defend.  It emitted ripples of energy.</p><p>These ripples possessed a binding power, which Elder Yanshan had used earlier to capture the Snow Fox.</p><p>Yuefei ignored Elder Yanshan, her gaze fixated on the Cold Crystal, clearly still unwilling to give up.</p><p>Only when she sensed the ripples approaching did she avert her gaze.  Quickly, she retrieved a silver bracelet from her wrist and flicked it. The bracelet vibrated, shattering the ripples and intercepting the thin cord, engaging in a fierce struggle.</p><p>Elder Yanshan discarded his dismissive attitude. “This woman possesses quite a few treasures. She must have some background. I wonder if she has accomplices. Fellow Daoist, act quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn't follow Elder Yanshan's urging. He said in a deep voice, “Fellow Daoist, you should be able to hold her off, right? I consider myself somewhat proficient in array formations, and this ocular technique of mine is helpful in breaking them. I ask that Fellow Daoist buy me some time. After this matter is concluded, we shall divide the Cold Crystal equally.”</p><p>As Qin Sang spoke, he observed Elder Yanshan.</p><p>They had just found the Cold Crystal, and a demoness had inexplicably appeared.  Could it be a mere coincidence?</p><p>Qin Sang harbored suspicions about Elder Yanshan.</p><p>He had come for the Cold Crystal, and obtaining the treasure was his top priority.</p><p>Once he had the Cold Crystal, he could consider how to deal with the demoness.</p><p>His main body was outside. If other experts approached, he could detect them in advance, so he wasn't worried about that for the time being.</p><p>Elder Yanshan was slightly taken aback. He turned and exchanged a glance with Qin Sang, nodding in agreement. “Alright! As Fellow Daoist says! My abilities are limited. I fear I may not be a match for this demoness. Fellow Daoist, please don't hold back!”</p><p>With that, Elder Yanshan tapped his foot and darted towards Yuefei, wielding his three-headed dragon shield as a weapon.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The three-headed dragon shield transformed into three streaks of black light, flitting around Yuefei, dazzling the eye.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if he was overthinking things. Dismissing his distracting thoughts, he flashed to the side of the ice pillar and, with the aid of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, began to decipher the spirit array on the ice surface.</p><p>Initially, seeing the densely packed runes, Qin Sang felt a wave of dizziness.</p><p>But soon, he made a delightful discovery.</p><p>The person who set up the array possessed exceptional skill in the Ice Dao.  The array was infused with Cold煞(sha) Energy.  Since his avatar had refined a Cold Crystal before, he could use this as a starting point to break the array.</p><p>Elder Yanshan and the demoness were both at the mid-Nascent Soul stage. Even if he wasn't a match for her, he should be able to hold her off.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn't forget to devote a portion of his attention to guarding against any unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Gradually, he began to unravel the array's intricacies.  His hand formed a grasping gesture, and the Snowtreading Divine Saber shrunk to the size of a dagger, its blade light restrained. It descended to the ground, and he began to carve within the array.</p><p>Wherever the tip of the blade passed, it left white marks. The saber energy within these marks, condensed and unwavering, formed runes, severing the connections within the spirit array’s energy flow.</p><p>Qin Sang moved swiftly, pausing only occasionally to contemplate.  He was close to breaking the array.</p><p>Suddenly, a startled cry interrupted him.</p><p>Looking over, he saw that the two had stopped fighting. Elder Yanshan stared at Yuefei’s forehead, a look of shock on his face.  “冥月(Mingyue) Mark!  You're a Mingyue Guard from Luye?”</p><p>When Elder Yanshan had attacked Yuefei’s forehead with his cord, he had forced out a blood moon mark.</p><p>Mingyue Mark.</p><p>Luye.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. Which Luye?</p><p>Following Elder Yanshan’s gaze, Qin Sang also saw the blood moon on the demoness’s forehead.</p><p>Elder Yanshan’s voice transmission arrived.</p><p>“The cultivation world has always used two signs to identify demon cultivators from Luye: one is the Dragon Slaying Demonic Force, and the other is the Mingyue Mark on their foreheads, signifying them as Mingyue Guards.  However, Old Demon Lu has been silent for centuries, and the Mingyue Guards have rarely been seen.  I recall the number of Mingyue Guards dwindling…”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, but his heart grew even more tense.</p><p>The demoness had such a formidable background!</p><p>What a coincidence. Just after entering the ice cave, a Mingyue Guard showed up. Could the legendary Luye be nearby?  An even more terrifying possibility arose:  Could the ice cave's spirit array and the Cold Crystals be the work of Old Demon Lu?</p><p>Both Qin Sang's avatar and his main body were present, but he wouldn't dare challenge a Deity Transformation cultivator.</p><p>Yuefei snorted. “Since you know my identity, why don't you scram!”</p><p>Elder Yanshan’s face shifted between green and white. Suddenly, he seemed to recall something, and the shock on his face subsided. He sneered, “Outsiders fear Old Demon Lu, not you Mingyue Guards! You're nothing more than disposable blood slaves, yet you dare call yourself 'Benfei'!  Old Demon Lu never indulges in women.  Furthermore, centuries ago, he went alone to Central Plains to meet with Deity Transformation cultivators of the righteous path, then vanished.  It's rumored that the Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery hold the secrets of ascension. Whenever a Deity Transformation cultivator appears from the outer regions, they're invited to Central Plains. Most, like Old Demon Lu, vanish without a trace, rumored to have ascended.  Old Demon Lu hasn’t been seen for centuries. Even if he hasn't ascended, he must be in seclusion, preparing for ascension…”</p><p>The seductive smile on Yuefei's lips faded.</p><p>Growing excited, Elder Yanshan’s expression turned to one of understanding.  He looked Yuefei up and down with disdain, mocking her, “After a demon cultivator reaches Deity Transformation, the Mingyue Mark becomes a full moon. The one in you couldn’t possibly be the work of Old Demon Lu!  Old Demon Lu has an adopted son, rumored to be a lustful scoundrel, collecting beauties everywhere. Judging by your cultivation and appearance, you must be quite favored.  However, he hasn’t even bothered to remove your Mingyue Mark. Heh… In the end, you’re just a plaything!”</p><p>Qin Sang was still digesting the information in Elder Yanshan's words.</p><p>There probably wasn’t a cultivator who didn’t yearn for ascension, but the "ascension" Elder Yanshan spoke of was clearly different from the ascension of ancient times.</p><p>Xiaoxiangzi had left an eight-character proverb – After Deity Transformation, know your destination.</p><p>Qin Sang had been pondering the meaning of this proverb. After arriving in Central State, he had inquired about the whereabouts of Deity Transformation cultivators but only obtained vague legends.</p><p>Deity Transformation cultivators were elusive, and they all seemed to disappear mysteriously in the end. He hadn't heard of any who had perished in heavenly tribulations or reached the end of their lifespan and passed away peacefully.</p><p>There's always a way.</p><p>With Xiaoxiangzi’s proverb and these discoveries, Qin Sang no longer dwelled on the path after Deity Transformation, focusing entirely on improving his cultivation and strength.</p><p>Was the place of ascension the same as the "destination" mentioned in the proverb?</p><p>Deity Transformation cultivators could "ascend," and the Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery knew the secrets of ascension.</p><p>It seemed that their status as leading sects of Daoism and Buddhism wasn't simply due to the frequent appearance of Deity Transformation cultivators within their ranks.</p><p>Elder Yanshan actually knew so many secrets.</p><p>What was his identity?</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed that Elder Yanshan was a detached, ascetic cultivator.</p><p>It was rumored that Luye was in the Northern Wastelands, where Elder Yanshan’s dwelling was also located. It was normal for him to know about Old Demon Lu's adopted son, but the other secrets didn't seem like something a detached cultivator could learn.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>A furious roar interrupted Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Yuefei, having been struck in her most vulnerable spot, flew into a rage.  With a wave of her jade hand, the pink pearl shot towards the space above Elder Yanshan's head.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>Thunder boomed.</p><p>The pearl emitted bolts of lightning, weaving into a net of thunder in mid-air, engulfing him.</p><p>The demoness, despite her alluring appearance, attacked with increasing ferocity.</p><p>Elder Yanshan didn't dare to be careless. He pointed his finger at the shield.</p><p>With a whistling sound, the three-headed dragon shield flew upwards, its ends connecting to form a peculiar triangular shield.  The three dragon mouths simultaneously spewed streams of water, creating a thick water barrier.</p><p>‘Splash! Splash! Splash!’</p><p>The lightning net flashed and plunged into the water barrier.</p><p>The water barrier instantly turned pink, resisting for a moment before being completely corroded.</p><p>Seeing the unfavorable situation, Elder Yanshan quickly changed his hand seals.</p><p>The dragon shield expanded rapidly, completely shielding him, using its main body to withstand the lightning net.</p><p>A loud ‘Bang’ resounded.</p><p>The dragon shield trembled.</p><p>Yuefei wouldn't relent. The pearl continued to shoot lightning, a downpour of thunder light, frantically attacking the dragon shield.</p><p>Simultaneously, Yuefei rubbed her fingers together.</p><p>The ice beneath Elder Yanshan exploded. A dragon-like roar erupted from below, and an ice dragon burst forth from the shattered ice.</p><p>The ice dragon was slender, its entire body composed of ice. Its horns, claws, and scales were all identical to those of a legendary true dragon.  It possessed a majestic aura and moved with remarkable agility, as if alive.</p><p>The ice dragon opened its massive jaws, lunging to bite Elder Yanshan’s legs.</p><p>Yuefei's every move was a deadly strike.</p><p>Elder Yanshan's expression shifted slightly. He twisted his palm, and a silver droplet of water slipped from it, exploding beneath him into a cloud of silver mist.</p><p>The seemingly light mist was heavy as a thousand jun. The ice dragon collided with it, a metallic clang echoing as its momentum was drastically reduced.</p><p>Elder Yanshan seized the opportunity, dodging to the side, avoiding the dragon’s jaws.</p><p>Elder Yanshan’s words had enraged the demoness.  Despite being prepared, he was still startled. He transmitted his voice urgently,  "This demoness is definitely not acting on Old Demon Lu’s orders. Fellow Daoist, don’t be intimidated by her bluff! The Mingyue Guards are essentially Old Demon Lu’s slaves. Countless Mingyue slaves have died outside, and no one has ever heard of Old Demon Lu avenging any of them.  However, there are quite a few powerful Mingyue Guards. If we delay too long, and the demoness summons reinforcements, it will be even more troublesome. Fellow Daoist, quickly retrieve the Cold Crystal and leave this place!”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>The situation had escalated, and there was no turning back.</p><p>What Elder Yanshan said wasn’t unreasonable. As long as Old Demon Lu didn’t personally intervene, Qin Sang wasn’t afraid of the so-called adopted son or the Mingyue Guards.</p><p>It was clear that the demoness was the one who truly coveted the Cold Crystal.</p><p>He would quickly take the Cold Crystal and leave. Would Old Demon Lu really come out of seclusion for his adopted son's concubine?</p><p>It seemed unlikely.</p><p>Currently, Central State only had four known Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>True Monarch Danyu, Saint Huiguang, and the Demon Saint King were all missing.</p><p>Old Demon Lu had disappeared even earlier. Could he be the exception, able to remain unaffected?</p>
