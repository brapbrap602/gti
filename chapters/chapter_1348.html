<h1>Chapter 1340: Sacred Flame</h1><p>The ghostly fog was incredibly dense, like a murky river encircling a blood-red altar.</p><p>Countless vengeful ghosts and spirits filled the area, radiating intense malice.</p><p>All of them revealed their true forms—grotesque, incomplete bodies, swept along by the river towards the altar, struggling desperately, their cries of pain and helplessness echoing.</p><p>The scene was reminiscent of the legendary Yellow Springs.</p><p>As the spirits approached the altar, they were assimilated by the ancient blood-red prohibitions, vanishing without a trace, becoming part of the altar itself.  Countless specters were consumed, the altar's crimson glow intensifying.</p><p>Above the altar, a blood-red cloud formed, exuding a thick stench of blood, its light piercing the sky.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The blood cloud churned violently, accompanied by howling winds and shaking void.</p><p>Its power was in no way inferior to the five-colored celestial winds in the inner hall.</p><p>A strange fluctuation rippled through the void above the altar, as if something was brewing.</p><p>Ye Laomo and Yu Gu hovered in mid-air, their figures frail and vulnerable in the storm.</p><p>Countless evil spirits surrounded them, filled with hatred, yet unable to approach.</p><p>Ye Laomo looked up, his gaze piercing the blood cloud towards the top of the altar, his eyes burning with intensity, uninterested in Yu Gu's words.</p><p>Yu Gu also fell silent, ignoring Qin Sang.</p><p>From Ye Laomo and Yu Gu's palms, thin crimson threads extended, drifting through the ghostly fog.</p><p>Some time passed.</p><p>Ye Laomo occasionally glanced at the altar, licking his lips.  In a raspy voice, he asked, "How many more souls must be consumed to unseal it? Our enemies are increasing, the Soul Infant Array is nearing its limit; it won't be able to hold them for much longer. If they break free, they'll destroy too many Blood Infant Crystals, jeopardizing the grand plan."</p><p>The Yuan Ying (Nascent Soul) merged with the crystal ball—these were the Blood Infant Crystals Ye Laomo spoke of.</p><p>The Yuan Ying transformed into Blood Infant Crystals had lost their consciousness, becoming ferocious Blood Infants controlled by them, forming the Soul Infant Array.</p><p>"If only I'd known this would happen!"</p><p>Yu Gu coldly snorted, "You should have opened the seal earlier and gathered enough souls externally.  There was no need for such a commotion…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, Yu Gu suddenly paused, turning towards Qin Sang's direction, a surprised sound escaping his lips.</p><p>"Sacred Flame?"</p><p>His tone held a mix of surprise and delight.</p><p>Ye Laomo looked at Yu Gu with surprise.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the ghostly fog.</p><p>A mass of red blood clouds surrounded Zhen Daochang and the others, ghostly figures everywhere.</p><p>Countless ghosts and spirits surrounded them, their eyes bloodshot, radiating palpable malice, controlled by something, exhibiting unnatural madness, attacking the group.</p><p>Noticing the approaching遁光 (escape light).</p><p>A look of alertness flashed across Zhen Daochang's face, which quickly turned to surprise upon recognizing the light. "Friend Qin!"</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>Sword energy, like flowing silk, preceded Qin Sang, piercing the ghostly fog and striking a blood cloud.</p><p>The blood cloud was pierced by the sword energy and burst apart.</p><p>In an instant, the scattered blood clouds coalesced, restoring themselves. The seemingly powerful strike hadn't harmed the blood clouds at all.</p><p>Qin Sang, following closely behind, abruptly stopped, his expression serious as he observed the blood clouds.</p><p>"Friend Qin, be careful! Do not let the blood clouds approach. They are soul-refining evil things that can defile the body and true essence.  If they invade your body, the consequences are unimaginable!"</p><p>Zhen Daochang warned loudly.</p><p>As Zhen Daochang spoke, two blood clouds changed targets, rushing towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his ebony sword, frowned at the blood clouds, and moved back, leaving a black shadow behind him—his Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet was an inanimate object, presumably unaffected by these evil things.</p><p>Qin Sang was eager to understand the situation, worried about Qing Jun and Bai's safety, so he didn't continue concealing his Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet punched towards the blood cloud!</p><p>Runes flickered across the Yuan Ying puppet’s body; the outline of the puppet seal and a faint blue glow could be seen.  The moment it struck, a black light emanated from it, forming a fist-shaped shadow and shattering the blood cloud into fragments.</p><p>The shattered blood cloud fragments drifted towards the Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed his Nascent Soul puppet to stand its ground.  As he expected, the fragments of the blood cloud only clung to the puppet's exterior, unable to penetrate.</p><p>Relieved, Qin Sang ordered the puppet to lead the way, while he followed behind on his sword.  </p><p>Man and puppet charged forward, the surrounding blood clouds and ghostly specters swarming them.  Qin Sang's black wood sword sliced through the ghosts, while the Nascent Soul puppet dispersed the blood clouds.  They worked in perfect coordination, pushing relentlessly ahead.</p><p>True Daoist quickly called for others to provide support.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A dark figure burst from a cloud of blood, appearing before them.  Even True Daoist, with his considerable cultivation, felt a chill at the sight of its murderous intent.</p><p>After a glance at the Nascent Soul puppet, True Daoist, realizing it belonged to Qin Sang, suppressed his surprise.  He wielded his whisk, unleashing a series of white lights to ease the pressure on Qin Sang.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang broke through the encirclement, nodded briefly to the others, and seamlessly joined the fight.  He and his puppet fought side-by-side.</p><p>The others couldn't help but steal glances at the Nascent Soul puppet, their expressions varying, but all sharing a common thread: astonishment.</p><p>Qin Sang's fame was already surpassing that of veteran experts; considering he had only achieved Nascent Soul stage a few decades ago, his accomplishments were truly remarkable.</p><p>Yet, merely twenty years after the great battle, he had somehow obtained a Nascent Soul-level puppet.  Its performance even seemed slightly superior to a Nascent Soul cultivator in the early stage.</p><p>No wonder they were shocked.</p><p>True Daoist, aware of Qin Sang's connection with Qing Jun, found the puppet's existence surprising yet understandable.  He didn't pry, instead addressing the matter at hand.  "Daoist Qin, you just came from the inner hall?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "That's right. I stumbled into a hidden realm.  Unexpectedly, the ancient prohibitions within blocked my talismanic sword's sensing capabilities. Upon seeing the message, I rushed over, only to find you all missing...What happened?"</p><p>"Daoist Qin, don't worry.  When we separated, I saw Daoist Leng and Daoist Jingyu together. They should be safe."</p><p>True Daoist, understanding Qin Sang's true concern, calmed him before explaining.  "We searched the inner hall but found no trace of Ye Lao Mo. The inner hall's anomalies grew increasingly intense, and the ancient prohibitions' power was daunting. With the appearance of the five-colored immortal wind, the inner hall became incredibly dangerous, so we decided to retreat and observe.  Just then, a blood-red altar shot a beam of blood into the sky, revealing Ye Lao Mo's location.  We returned to the outer hall, aiming to capture him first. He might know the cause of the Purple Micro Palace's anomaly.  Except for Daoist Qin, Feather King, and Daoist Lu, most of the top experts were present..." (To be continued)</p>
