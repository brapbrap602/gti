<h1></h1><p>After the initial shock, everyone remembered their primary objective and hastily searched for traces of Ye Laomo.</p><p>But the inner palace of the Purple Star Palace was in complete chaos.</p><p>Miraculous phenomena were everywhere.</p><p>“It’s impossible that Ye Laomo did this! In recent years, the Purple Star Palace has emerged earlier and earlier, clearly a process of some transformation brewing. Now it seems the truth will be revealed today. However, I'm afraid it won't be as we previously predicted, with the Purple Star Palace fully opening, but a greater upheaval!”</p><p>Yu Wang possessed the most seniority, his fame preceding even Tongyou Mojun and Zhenyi Daoren.</p><p>He gazed at the inner palace, looking at this familiar yet unfamiliar Immortal Palace.</p><p>The Yu Wang Palace’s heritage spanned generations, each Yu Demon King a hegemon of the Celestial Demon Mound. Previously, venturing into the Purple Star Palace's immortal formations required reliance on the inherited treasures of the Yu Wang Palace, and thus, they were never absent.</p><p>Among the cultivators present, perhaps no one knew more secrets than him.</p><p>Even so, he couldn't help but marvel; the Purple Star Palace still concealed so many secrets!</p><p>Many places had been explored countless times, seemingly ordinary. Now they knew that wasn't the case; limited by their cultivation and knowledge, they had only seen the surface.</p><p>The current Purple Star Palace surpassed everyone's understanding.</p><p>An unprecedented immortal realm.</p><p>Incredibly powerful ancient restrictions.</p><p>Alluring immortal herbs and ancient treasures.</p><p>…</p><p>The Heavenly Mountain, originally thought to be the core area, now seemed less prominent amongst the countless secret realms.</p><p>“Ye Laomo has been scheming for centuries, choosing this time to strike and even releasing a demon of unknown origin. It seems he knew the Purple Star Palace would undergo this transformation.”</p><p>Zhenyi Daoren glanced around.</p><p>Everyone's thoughts were likely no longer on Ye Laomo.</p><p>The Purple Star Palace’s transformation, whether good or bad, was still unknown.</p><p>But for everyone, this was a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. Take the Ancient Herb Garden, for example. Originally, one might struggle to find even a single immortal herb, but now spiritual light flickered everywhere.  As long as one could withstand the restrictions of the Ancient Herb Garden, they could obtain one.</p><p>Zhenyi Daoren sighed inwardly; how could he not be tempted?</p><p>Several top experts communicated through sound transmission.</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren announced in a clear voice, “Finding Ye Laomo is like searching for a needle in the ocean. Let’s disperse and act individually. If anyone discovers traces of Ye Laomo, immediately send a signal. Everyone, don't be blinded by the immediate benefits.  Think about Ye Laomo's actions.  If this demon isn't eliminated soon, the Northern Star Realm will never know peace!”</p><p>Everyone was already eager to try. Hearing this, they agreed one after another and impatiently flew towards the inner palace.</p><p>Someone invited Qin Sang to join forces in treasure hunting.</p><p>Qin Sang politely declined, identified a gap in the sea of clouds, and, mounting his escaping light, flew through it, entering the inner palace.</p><p>Multicolored auspicious clouds drifted throughout the Purple Star Palace, clusters of immortal palaces truly resembling an immortal realm.</p><p>His gaze swept across the surroundings.  After everyone had left, he avoided others' notice and landed on a fragment of land.  His Corpse Puppet Pouch at his waist flashed, and Bai flew out from within.</p><p>Seeing the miraculous phenomena of the Purple Star Palace, Bai’s eyes flickered.  After pondering for a moment, he turned to Qin Sang and said, “Go and subdue the Southern Bright Ember Fire quickly. Delays may lead to complications. I'll stay outside and wait for your senior sister, and look around. I'll send you a message if I have any news.”</p><p>Qin Sang had precisely this intention.</p><p>The scene before him was entirely unexpected.  No one could predict what changes the Purple Star Palace would ultimately undergo. What if it was a final burst of brilliance before destruction?</p><p>If he missed this opportunity, he didn’t know if there would be another.</p><p>Qin Sang was grateful that his years of hard work had not been in vain, refining his magical treasures, though he only had less than a fifty percent chance of subduing the Southern Bright Ember Fire.</p><p>“Be careful, Bai. I shouldn't be delayed for too long,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Subduing spiritual fire, success or failure, would be known immediately upon attempting.</p><p>He left the Demon Binding Rope with Bai and set off with only the Nascent Soul Puppet.</p><p>Entering the Purple Star Palace this time felt completely different from the previous two times.</p><p>Places that were previously safe now had secret realms appearing, with layers of ancient restrictions flickering in and out of existence, filled with unknown dangers. No one dared to fly around as recklessly as before.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword, transformed into sword light, and landed firmly on the ground upon reaching the edge of the inner palace.</p><p>He looked towards Sword Scar Mountain.  After a moment, his gaze scanned back and forth, searching for a safe path.  Finally, he found one with the fewest miraculous occurrences and set off without hesitation.</p><p>As he approached the Purple Star Palace’s secret realms, Qin Sang became even more awestruck.</p><p>At this moment, he sincerely yearned for the splendor of the ancient cultivation world!</p><p>Present-day cultivators were like frogs in a well. Without witnessing it firsthand, it was difficult to imagine such magnificent scenery existing in the world. Even the remnants and ruins of the Purple Star Palace's secret realms remained unparalleled.</p><p>Qin Sang’s fascination with those unprecedented ancient restrictions wasn't anything to be ashamed of; he simply couldn't comprehend them.</p><p>This made Qin Sang even more worried.</p><p>Sword Scar Mountain was clearly also affected.  Previously, the illusion formation had been dormant, allowing him and Yun Youzi, at the Foundation Establishment stage, to pass through it and find the alchemy chamber where the Southern Bright Ember Fire resided.</p><p>With the transformation, he wasn't confident he could navigate the illusion formation even with his current cultivation.</p><p>The good news was that the immemorial sword energy of Sword Scar Mountain had also erupted, seemingly disrupting the illusion formation.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang didn’t stop, swiftly traversing the distance until he was not far from the Ancient Herb Garden.</p><p>He noticed that most cultivators, including Yu Wang and the Lu cultivator, were heading for the Ancient Herb Garden, even more than those going to the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>This was because the Ancient Herb Garden had undergone the greatest transformation, with the hidden supreme spiritual herbs appearing, making their locations easy to confirm. It was a first-come, first-served situation, simpler than searching for ancient treasures in other secret realms.</p><p>The Lu cultivator, busy running around treating Han Xi's injuries, naturally wouldn't miss this excellent opportunity. He was the one who had invited Qin Sang to join him earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Ancient Herb Garden.</p><p>Of course, he was also extremely tempted.</p><p>Supreme immortal herbs were unique, and obtaining even one was a tremendous fortune, possessing unimaginable miraculous effects.</p><p>Especially the Hanging Garden Palace at the center of the Ancient Herb Garden.</p><p>Before his tribulation, Yun Youzi had described the Hanging Garden Palace's origins and details to Qin Sang in detail.  Knowing it could nurture the sentient Pure Fortune Bamboo, it was clearly the most crucial area within the Ancient Herb Garden.</p><p>However, after weighing his options, Qin Sang decided that the Southern Bright Ember Fire was more important to him, reluctantly tearing his gaze away.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang arrived at an empty space.</p><p>There were no miraculous phenomena here. He was about to cross it when he suddenly felt something amiss. His expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly stopped at the edge.</p><p>The next moment, a spring gurgled up in the center of the empty space.</p><p>Water continuously flowed out, quickly forming a small pool.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept over the area, realizing that the terrain here was lower.  It should have been a small lake that had dried up, now reviving before his eyes.</p><p>“The Purple Star Palace's transformation is still ongoing!”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, feeling even more urgency.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a crescent-shaped lake appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>The surrounding scenery revived along with the lake. Purple bamboo shoots emerged, growing into a bamboo forest at a visible pace. A gentle breeze blew, rustling the bamboo leaves, creating an incredibly serene atmosphere. </p>
