Chapter 169: Ambush

"Fellow cultivator Qin, though young, is more careful than an experienced survivor. In order to act realistically, I didn't hesitate to damage my own sea of Qi and seal off my spiritual power. Even this couldn't fool you. You're much more formidable than that fool."

Baiyun Mountain Man stared at Wu Yuesheng in the pool of blood and couldn't help but sneer. Qin Sang glanced sideways, expressionless, and didn't comment on Baiyun Mountain Man's words.

At the moment the anomaly occurred, he withdrew the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword.

Right now, Qin Sang hid in the sword energy of the Five Colors Sword, and his tone was strange: "Fellow cultivator Baiyun chose this place well. Attacking at this time, aren't you worried about the Fiend Corpse entangling you and dying here together?"

Baiyun Mountain Man gave a low laugh, his eyes gleaming with undisguised greed. He looked at Qin Sang and said, "Mere dead things! This place is a wonderful site to destroy the corpse... You two fellow cultivators come from famous sects. With the treasures you possess, why should I fear this brainless thing?"

Before the words finished sounding, Baiyun Mountain Man, who originally had a kind and gentle appearance, suddenly became savage. As he raised his hand and pointed it at Qin Sang, the Kuntian Pocket flew out with a swoosh. A gust of wind carried the Fiend Corpse and instantly moved several zhang away. This seemed to be the true power of the Kuntian Pocket. The wind gust was not at all as fragile as before, shaking dangerously.

"Fellow cultivator Qin can first have a good time playing with the Fiend Corpse!"

Baiyun Mountain Man sneered, mind slightly stirred. The Kuntian Pocket violently shook, facing the direction of Qin Sang. The wind gust suddenly revealed an opening, and the Fiend Corpse once again broke free.

As the Kuntian Pocket opened, it pointed straight towards Qin Sang.

Although the Fiend Corpse had developed spiritual intelligence, it hadn't reached the extent of being clever or crafty. When it broke free from its predicament, its instinct was still to choose to attack the first enemy it discovered. Just now, Baiyun Mountain Man manipulated the Fiend Corpse like this to ambush Wu Yuesheng, and it worked all at once.

In Baiyun Mountain Man's view, Qin Sang was entangled with the Fiend Corpse. He only needed to not attract the attention of the Fiend Corpse and manipulate the Kuntian Pocket to put Qin Sang in a few binds. Then, he could easily collect the fruits of victory.

Unexpectedly, the situation didn't unfold as he had predicted.

As the Kuntian Pocket started moving, Qin Sang flew out from the protection of the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword, his movements extremely quick as he flew off in an unexpected direction. He didn't seize the initiative to counter-kill Baiyun Mountain Man but headed for the corpse in the corner of the grand hall.

Qin Sang didn't believe Baiyun Mountain Man's nonsense at all. As a self-cultivator, Baiyun Mountain Man could survive until now, not only successfully breaking through to the Foundation Establishment period, but also becoming somewhat famous among cultivators, and was definitely a very shrewd character.

Unless he could guarantee a surefire success or had immense benefits in front of him, he wouldn't be moved to plot against two Foundation Establishment cultivators from Mount Shaohua.

Baiyun Mountain Man didn't know what treasures they had on them, so this temptation clearly wasn't enough to make him risk it. After all, once he failed, the result would be endless suffering.

In this case, the corpse in the corner of the grand hall was the most alluring. The silver Heavenly Corpse Sect Ancient Order, the black bag, and the cracked iron stake all seemed ordinary, but at least one of them had to be of excellent quality.

Before they met, the four people present had only analyzed the situation. Only Baiyun Mountain Man knew anything about the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Now it seemed that he must have concealed many things back then. The ancient records about the Heavenly Corpse Sect definitely weren't as simple as he described it.

Upon seeing Qin Sang's movements, Baiyun Mountain Man's expression slightly changed. He realized that Qin Sang had already seen through his intentions, and while greatly surprised, he didn't panic too much. He immediately urged the Kuntian Pocket to stop Qin Sang.

At the same time, he stopped disguising himself, immediately deploying his techniques and rushing towards the corpse.

In order to avoid arousing the vigilance of Qin Sang and Wu Yuesheng, he had never revealed his interest in the corpse, but was also approaching it slowly. Right now, he was much closer to the corpse than Qin Sang.

Unexpectedly, at this time, a scene that shocked Baiyun Mountain Man occurred.

After the Fiend Corpse escaped from the wind gust, it ignored Qin Sang before it and suddenly turned around. Its savage blood-red eyes tightly watched him. The next moment, it disappeared from the spot.

Baiyun Mountain Man's heart jumped, his complexion greatly changing. He didn't know why the Fiend Corpse was acting so irrationally, but time clearly didn't allow him to think too much.

The Fiend Corpse's escape technique was strange, and its speed was far faster than his movement technique.

Although Baiyun Mountain Man was confident in suppressing the Fiend Corpse, he didn't dare let it approach. Apart from the Kuntian Pocket, his several other low-level defensive magic tools weren't worth mentioning. With no other choice, Baiyun Mountain Man could only give up obstructing Qin Sang and hastily recalled the Kuntian Pocket.

*Thud!*

A muffled sound rang out as the Corpse Demon arrived before them instantly. Its ghastly shadow materialized next to Baiyuns真人.

Kuntiandou barely managed to fly back in the nick of time, blocking the Corpse Demon’s sneak attack.

However, Baiyuns真人 was struck by the powerful impact and his body trembled violently. He felt his speed drop immediately and looked towards Qin Sang with a frown. He noticed that the man seemed completely unaware of the Corpse Demon’s actions. Qin Sang continued to charge at the skeleton and was about to collect the treasures.

Watching this unfold, Baiyuns真人’s heart grew heavy with anxiety. He hurriedly retrieved his wooden staff magic artifact and threw it with all his might at Qin Sang’s back. At the same time, he formed a large hand out of spiritual energy and grabbed at the skeleton and the treasures, intending to interfere with Qin Sang.

Flustered, Baiyuns真人 failed to notice that as he was preoccupied with the treasures, an illusory figure quietly appeared behind him—it was another Qin Sang!

At this moment, Qin Sang had two objects in his hands—the Soul Devouring Cone and the Profound Yin Thunder!

After having exchanged so many blows with the Corpse Demon, Qin Sang had already come to understand its weaknesses.

The Corpse Demon’s actions and targets were not determined by what it saw, but by the aura—the primal impulse that drove it. What most aroused its killing desire was the essence of living beings!

Under the cover of the Five Elements Sword Breaking Formation, Qin Sang concealed himself with the Falling Cloud Wings and the Concealing Soul Art. Although it would be impossible to keep the secret from the Corpse Demon forever, his intention was only to distract the demon long enough for it to shift its target.

After all, there was a more conspicuous Baiyuns真人 behind him. It was obvious who the Corpse Demon would choose.

The other ‘Qin Sang’ was merely a clone he had created using the Shadow Shifting Spell.

Under normal circumstances, such a simple clone technique would not have fooled Baiyuns真人, but the situation had changed suddenly. Baiyuns真人 had been caught off guard by the Corpse Demon’s sneak attack and was focused on the ancient treasure. In his haste, he would not have had the time to scrutinize it carefully.

*Thud!*

The wooden staff magic artifact struck the ‘Qin Sang’ in the back and shattered it into pieces. At the same time, the large hand made of spiritual energy met no resistance and seized the treasure.

Upon witnessing this, Baiyuns真人’s face was devoid of joy. Instead, it was filled with astonishment and terror as he turned around abruptly!

*Boom!*

The Soul Devouring Cone exploded.

A blinding blue light filled Baiyuns真人’s vision.

The raging water-elemental energy surged like a tidal wave, engulfing Baiyuns真人.
