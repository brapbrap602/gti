<h1>Chapter 2004: The Jade Emperor</h1><p>The tide surged.</p><p>A wall of water advanced with the white line, seawater inundating almost everything except a mountain at the island's center.  The ocean stretched endlessly in the direction the tide was coming from.</p><p>The setting sun cast a dim light.</p><p>As the tide arrived, the island's surroundings brightened.  What had previously seemed like mere waves were actually countless points of light.</p><p>These tiny lights were insects, similar in form to beetles, glowing like fireflies but far smaller.</p><p>The swarm of insects, their lights intertwining, created patterns of light and shadow resembling luminous seaweed.</p><p>The insects drifted with the tide; the current itself seemed composed of them, countless and ubiquitous from surface to seabed.</p><p>In an instant, the small island and the white tiger still remaining on it were completely surrounded.</p><p>Although there was no immediate sense of danger when the tide first arrived, the scene was still quite frightening.</p><p>Inside the quiet room, Qin Sang frowned, watching from outside.</p><p>The Witch Insect List contained no mention of these insects.  Their individual abilities were weak, as fragile as ants, but their sheer number was staggering.</p><p>Certain insects, unremarkable individually, can undergo a transformation when they reach a critical mass, developing unimaginable powers and becoming extremely dangerous, forcing even cultivators to retreat.</p><p>The Witch Insect List only includes insects with significant abilities and potential, those with strong individual strengths, serving as a guide for those cultivating insect arts.</p><p>Cultivators find it extremely difficult to control these types of insects, hence their absence from the list.</p><p>It was unclear what powers these luminous insects possessed, but judging by Li'er's actions, she surely had a plan.</p><p>"What kind of insects are those in the sea?" someone asked.</p><p>"Those are Tide-Following Insects. They're finally here!"</p><p>Li'er replied cheerfully, letting out a cry of joy. She leaped into the air, a series of clicks and whirs transforming her into a mer-shark. With a powerful spring, she dove into the sea.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Water sprayed high into the air.</p><p>Li'er, now a true mer-shark, swam agilely through the current.  Her skin was covered in countless small spots, identical in size and luminosity to the Tide-Following Insects.  She even mimicked the insects' unique wave patterns.</p><p>The Tide-Following Insects mistook Li'er for one of their own; the scattered swarm immediately converged upon her.</p><p>The spots on Li'er's skin began to faintly flicker, as if possessing some magic.  More and more insects gathered, creating a dense cluster of light that enveloped Li'er, making her indistinguishable from the swarm.</p><p>Li'er completely blended with the insects, drifting with them along the current.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the swarm for a while, detecting nothing unusual. The current was surprisingly swift. He thought that Chanjin City certainly had its methods, as even with his considerable experience in insect control, understanding these insects wouldn't be easy.</p><p>The Tide-Following Insects were silent; only the sound of flowing water filled the current, creating an unusual stillness.  Others, reassured, entered meditation.</p><p>This drift lasted three years.</p><p>During those three years, Li'er never changed form or displayed any token, yet they encountered no attacks from beasts or cultivators. This indicated that the Tide-Following Insects were not harmless, and Li'er must have used some method to deceive the swarm.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Li'er emerged from the water, reverting to her white tiger form. Shaking her fur, she raised a paw and waved at the insect swarm. "Goodbye! Thank you for protecting Li'er!"</p><p>The swarm, naturally, didn't respond, but Li'er didn't mind. She took off at a run. Approaching Da Zhou, the area became noticeably safer, and she increased her speed.</p><p>Three months later, someone else disembarked.</p><p>"Please let me off. Thank you, Miss Li'er, for the escort."</p><p>An elderly man left the ship.</p><p>In the fifth month, Zhu Que suddenly woke Qin Sang, excitedly pointing out the window. Qin Sang saw a black line on the horizon, extending infinitely in both directions.</p><p>"Esteemed guests, we've arrived! The tide came early; we're half a year ahead of schedule!"</p><p>Li'er's voice echoed through the cabin, awakening everyone.</p><p>"We've finally reached Da Zhou!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, gazing at the continent.</p><p>Ahead lies the land of Da Zhou, where humans thrive.  What awaits him?  Delight or danger?  He doesn’t know.</p><p>From the remote Yue Du Bay to Da Zhou, he has only now truly taken his first step into the vast world.</p><p>“Will I meet old friends in Da Zhou?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze was distant and pensive.</p><p>Before, he thought searching for old friends in the vast world would be like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, humanity has the Da Zhou Celestial Kingdom and Bai Yu Jing, a human sanctuary, effectively the center of humanity, the most prominent landmark.  Ascended cultivators, given the chance, would surely want to visit it.</p><p>As the center of humanity, Da Zhou’s Bai Yu Jing must hold many opportunities, undoubtedly attracting countless heroes.</p><p>Ascended cultivators from the Storm Realm might have established power bases in Da Zhou, leaving behind legends.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang most wanted to see his old friends. If they also reached Bai Yu Jing, they would surely meet.</p><p>“Five hundred years!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Adding the two hundred years in the Talisman Realm, he had been ‘ascended’ for nearly eight hundred years – a number unimaginable to ordinary mortals.  Much, much could happen in that time.</p><p>“The prefecture city of Lan Tan Prefecture is called Lan Tan City, not far from the South Sea. We’ll arrive in three days!”</p><p>Li’er stepped onto land, her body trembling slightly.  A joyful sound escaped her, interrupting Qin Sang’s thoughts.</p><p>The cultivators on the ship planned to make decisions upon reaching Lan Tan City, so no one disembarked.</p><p>Stepping ashore, they were greeted by a high mountain range stretching along the coast into the distance.</p><p>Li’er, wings sprouting from her sides, transformed into a flying tiger.  Her expanded vision revealed endless rolling mountains stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>“Truly worthy of Gen Prefecture!”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others couldn’t help but marvel.  The eight Great Heavenly Prefectures were named after the eight trigrams; seemingly there was a correspondence between them and the卦象.</p><p>As they traveled, they saw mortals working and cultivators coming and going; the overall atmosphere was peaceful.</p><p>On the third day, just past noon, a mountain city came into view – Lan Tan City.</p><p>Built on a mountain, Lan Tan City was neat and orderly, nothing spectacular, yet unremarkable. It reminded Qin Sang of the Daoist Court's celestial city.</p><p>‘*Pa!*’</p><p>Li’er descended from the sky, landing on all fours on a high platform in the city.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed guards and the presence of a large formation within the city, but no one stopped them or questioned them.  Clearly, they had the privileges afforded by Canjin City.</p><p>“Lan Tan City has arrived; Li’er’s mission is complete!  Esteemed guests may disembark!”</p><p>Li’er opened a door in her abdomen, and Qin Sang and the others stepped out.</p><p>“Ah! Li’er’s finally back!”</p><p>A joyful cry came from below, and a fiery red figure flew out – a fire phoenix.</p><p>This fire phoenix was clearly another automaton, presumably the type of Vermillion Phoenix Li’er had mentioned.</p><p>“Hong’er sister, Li’er missed you!”</p><p>Li’er bounced over, and the tiger and phoenix embraced tightly, twirling and leaping, finally with tiger paw resting on phoenix wing, dancing in midair, joyfully displaying their reunion.</p><p>Such pure, sincere affection was rare in the cultivation world; even the older cultivators smiled kindly.</p><p>“Miss Li’er, farewell!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly and walked toward the courtyard exit.</p><p>Li’er had given a general introduction to Lan Tan City along the way, and he already had a plan.</p><p>“Daoist, please wait,” Huai Ting called out from behind him.</p><p>Learning that Huai Ting planned to settle in Lan Tan City first, exploring the surroundings and familiarizing himself with the area before venturing deeper, Qin Sang again declined Huai Ting’s invitation to travel together. Huai Ting, being a free-spirited individual, said farewell and turned to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang turned down a street and found several trading houses, purchasing several topographical maps.  He found their contents largely similar, only more detailed than Li’er's, marking nearby sects, forces, and forbidden areas, but leaving the verification of their accuracy to him.</p><p>He lingered at one trading house and chatted with the manager.</p><p>“Chenghui Prefecture is the westernmost prefecture of Gen Prefecture? What lies beyond?” Qin Sang asked, pointing to the topographical map.</p><p>“Mountains!”</p><p>The manager replied, drawing a semicircle on the edge of the topographical map, “Aside from the sea, it’s all mountains.  Endless mountains, endless dangers.  They say it’s the same between Gen Prefecture and Bai Yu Jing – endless mountains one could never traverse in a lifetime.  Hence the name Gen Prefecture.”</p><p>“Of course, I haven’t been there. I heard it from a senior cultivator. Daoist Qin, are you planning to go to those places?” The manager asked.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to use his real name in Da Zhou; perhaps it would reach the ears of his old friends.</p><p>“It’s not likely to be easy, I fear?”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside, sighing, “Our prefecture, one of Gen Prefecture’s many prefectures, doesn’t even have a Grand Teleportation Array to other prefectures!”</p><p>The manager chuckled.  “Grand Teleportation Arrays aren’t easy to construct. Lan Tan Prefecture hasn’t even existed for a thousand years yet.  Who knows when our Prefect will have the resources to build one?  Travel will be so much easier then.”</p><p>Oh? So Lan Tan Prefecture is also within the Great Zhou Empire?  And the Grand Teleportation Array needs the Prefect's personal supervision for its construction?” Qin Sang feigned confusion.</p><p>The manager studied Qin Sang, then said dismissively, “Have you, Daoist Qin, met the Zhou Emperor?  Do you think it’s like the mortal realm? When the Emperor conquers the land, he appoints officials and generals to govern. I hear…”</p><p>The manager lowered his voice, making a mysterious gesture,  “It’s said that if powerful cultivators want to build a city or prefecture, as long as they meet certain conditions, they can simply report it, declare allegiance to the Zhou Emperor, and request an imperial edict. Many prefectures and cities were established this way.”</p><p>“Is Tianji City, the capital of Gen Prefecture, also like that?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He pondered silently. It seemed that the Zhou Emperor’s claim to be the supreme ruler was more about a righteous title; countless forces in the land probably only obeyed when it suited them.</p><p>“That, I don’t know. They say the Eight Great Prefectures and Baiyu Capital have existed since time immemorial, from the time of the Jade Emperor’s creation of the world,” the manager shook his head.</p><p>The Jade Emperor!</p><p>This wasn't the first time Qin Sang had heard this name.</p><p>The people of Great Zhou didn’t hold much reverence for the current Emperor, but legends of the Jade Emperor were widespread, known to everyone.</p><p>Legend has it that the Jade Emperor created the world, led humanity out of the wilderness, toiled tirelessly, expelled demons, established proper rites, passed down immortal arts, and founded the Great Zhou Empire and the Eight Great Prefectures, laying a foundation that would last for eternity.  From then on, humanity truly prospered and stood tall among the myriad worlds.</p><p>Baiyu Capital is the Jade Emperor's residence, and the Eight Great Prefectures, firmly established throughout the land, have existed since ancient times.  All successive Zhou Emperors are descendants of the Jade Emperor.</p><p>If the legend were true, the Jade Emperor’s accomplishments would be unmatched, his prestige unparalleled, and he would be revered throughout the myriad worlds.  The position of the Great Zhou Empire and its Emperor would then be easily understood.</p><p>Anyone who dared to overthrow the Great Zhou would be defying the righteous cause of humanity.</p><p>However, a mere manager of a trading company has limited knowledge, mostly hearsay, especially in a place like Lan Tan Prefecture that doesn’t even have a small teleportation array.  These legends are highly questionable.</p><p>Qin Sang listened politely, realizing he’d need to go to Baiyu Capital to find the truth. He chatted with the manager a while longer, then asked, “I wish to travel to other prefectures, but I fear I’m too weak to travel safely alone. Do you have any recommendations?”</p><p>“Canjin City, of course!”</p><p>The manager didn't hesitate.  “But Canjin City charges exorbitant fees; ordinary people can’t afford it.  As long as you can pay, there's no better choice in Gen Prefecture.”</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance.”</p><p>Qin Sang got up, and before leaving, bought some more spiritual materials, causing the manager to beam.</p><p>After wandering around Lan Tan City for a while, Qin Sang didn’t leave the city, and sought out Canjin City.</p><p>This time, he was greeted by Chi Feng Hong’er.</p><p>The closest prefecture to Lan Tan Prefecture with a Grand Teleportation Array was Xu Shan Prefecture. Qin Sang explained his purpose, and Hong’er immediately agreed, but said they needed to wait a month to gather more people for the journey.</p><p>Again, Qin Sang entered Hong’er’s belly.</p><p>These mechanical beasts traveled on land much like they did at sea.  Hong’er sometimes danced like a phoenix in the sky, sometimes shifted into legs and feet to run across the ground, exhibiting various ingenious transformations.</p><p>When they passed through a swamp shrouded in miasma, they even entered the belly of a giant crocodile for a river crossing. The crocodile wasn't a demonic beast, but a regular beast, yet it could survive in the miasma.</p><p>Along the way, they stopped at various cities, outposts, and sects, allowing passengers to get on and off in an orderly fashion.</p><p>Upon reaching Xu Shan Prefecture smoothly, the rest of the journey became much easier, thanks to the Grand Teleportation Array.</p><p>Unlike the Daoist Court, the Great Zhou Empire’s checkpoints were not strict, mostly focusing on the travelers’ cultivation levels for appropriate precautions.</p><p>Qin Sang, a Transcending Void cultivator, received some attention, and always felt like he was being watched.</p><p>The Grand Teleportation Array was convenient, but incredibly expensive; even a Nascent Divinity cultivator would find a single trip painful.</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, didn’t mind the expense. Seeing Gen Prefecture and Baiyu Capital so close, he didn’t plan on making any more stops along the way. After several transfers, he finally reached his destination.</p><p>The capital of Gen Prefecture, Tianji City!</p><p>A slight dizziness, then he returned to normal. Qin Sang calmed his turbulent true essence, and surveyed his surroundings, finding himself in a sealed hall.</p><p>A line of guards in black armor stood in the hall.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang felt a subtle aura locking onto him. Should he make a wrong move, the array would activate instantly, likely obliterating even a Transcending Void cultivator like himself.  He couldn't help but feel a chill.</p><p>“Daoist friend, you may enter the city through this array.”</p><p>The leader gestured.  Beside the Grand Teleportation Array were rows of smaller teleportation arrays, all leading to Tianji City, thus concealing the Grand Teleportation Array from view.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, chose one at random, and stepped into the array.</p>
