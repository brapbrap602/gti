<h1>**Chapter 185: Sword Demon**</h1><p>**Chapter 185: Sword Demon**</p><p>"Are you sure this is an unclaimed cave dwelling?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked with a deep voice, for he did not wish to provoke a powerful enemy for no reason. If that was the case, he might as well help them find a suitable cave dwelling.</p><p>Le Xing nodded repeatedly, "I am certain that the owner of the cave dwelling has been dead for a long time... I wonder if senior remembers an incident that occurred in the Yun Cang Wetlands hundreds of years ago?"</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang knew nothing about the incident and shook his head, "Tell me about it."</p><p>"It's said that an immortal abode emerged in the depths of the Yun Cang Wetlands and a bloody incident took place. A female cultivator obtained a valuable treasure in the immortal abode and was killed after being besieged..."</p><p>As Le Xing elaborated, Qin Sang started to get some understanding of the so-called incident. However, not only was it a long time ago, Le Xing's knowledge and experience were also limited, so he could not find much information, and many of the details were uncertain.</p><p>The Yun Cang Wetlands was a vast and boundless expanse of water. Over countless years, it had been explored by innumerable cultivators. Yet, many secret realms and legacies remained hidden in the depths of the Wetlands. Many cultivators searched diligently in the Yun Cang Wetlands, hoping to find ancient legacies or relics and change their fate.</p><p>The Yun Cang Wetlands was sparsely populated. Normally, even if a secret realm or legacy emerged, it would not cause a great stir. The lucky few who entered would quietly accumulate wealth, and after obtaining the treasure, they would go into seclusion and cultivate, never revealing the news until their death.</p><p>However, that immortal abode was different. When it emerged, celestial music filled the air and auspicious signs appeared. Rainbows hung in the sky, and cerulean clouds covered the sun, visible even from far away.</p><p>With such an auspicious sign, there was surely a treasure that would soon appear. All the cultivators who were in the Yun Cang Wetlands were overjoyed and rushed to the source of the phenomenon.</p><p>Although the immortal abode emerged in the depths of the Yun Cang Wetlands, the celestial signs lasted for an entire day before the immortal abode opened. By then, quite a few cultivators had gathered outside the immortal abode, and they entered together.</p><p>The bloody incident occurred within the immortal abode. It was said that the female cultivator had obtained a valuable treasure but accidentally leaked the news, and the people who had entered the immortal abode together besieged and killed her. Among those involved were two Golden Core Venerables from Yuan Xin Sect.</p><p>After hearing this, Qin Sang was not surprised at all. Treasures could move hearts, and killing for treasures was a common occurrence in the cultivation world.</p><p>However, what caused such a stir was not the female cultivator being besieged and killed, but that she had an extremely powerful Daoist companion. After the female cultivator was killed, he appeared out of nowhere and sought revenge for her.</p><p>At that time, with a man and a sword, he killed all the cultivators who had entered the immortal abode. The blood flowed like a river in the Yun Cang Wetlands, and the people were terrified. Finally, he even broke into the Yuan Xin Sect and killed the two Golden Core Venerables under their swords before retreating unscathed. He left behind the title of "Sword Demon."</p><p>After hearing this, Qin Sang's first reaction was how could that be possible!</p><p>Just like Shaohua Sect, the Yuan Xin Sect was also located in the Yun Cang Wetlands, east and west of Shaohua Sect. The Yuan Xin Sect was more remote and was closer to the domain of the Heavenly Demons of the West.</p><p>As one of the Eight Orthodox Sects, the Yuan Xin Sect also had Nascent Soul ancestors. Would they just watch their Golden Core disciples being killed?</p><p>Furthermore, the Yuan Xin Sect was proficient in the Dao of formations. Back when the founding ancestor of Yuan Zhao Sect set up their protective sect formation, they invited a Nascent Soul ancestor from the Yuan Xin Sect for help. The Yuan Xin Sect's protective sect formation must be even more formidable. Even if a Nascent Soul cultivator came personally, they might not be able to gain an advantage.</p><p>The Sword Demon was not only able to kill two Golden Core cultivators, but he could also retreat from the Yuan Xin Sect unscathed. What was his cultivation level?</p><p>Filled with doubts, Qin Sang turned to ask Granny Jing for confirmation. Unexpectedly, Granny Jing glanced at him and said, "It is true. Fellow Daoist Qin can go to the Heaven Scar Pavilion to check the records. You will be able to verify it. As far as this old woman knows, that Sword Demon has a deep connection to the Shaohua Sect. It is very likely that he is someone called Qing Zhu from the Shaohua Sect."</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu!</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely shocked. He suddenly recalled that when he first entered the sect, Zhuang Yan had mentioned the Sword Gate Pass and told him about the legend of Senior Qing Zhu - in a fit of anger, he had split open the front mountain with a sword, breaking through the formation and leaving behind the Sword Gate Pass.</p><p>Even now, the Shaohua Sect disciples still missed Senior Qing Zhu's demeanor as they looked at the peach blossoms that filled the mountains.</p><p>After Qin Sang decided to cultivate the [Chapter of Nascent Soul Nourishing Sword], he had wanted to learn from Senior Qing Zhu's cultivation process, but there were very few records of Senior Qing Zhu in the Treasure Pagoda Peak, only a record of him forming his Golden Core in forty years.</p><p>Even Senior Brother Wen's understanding of Senior Qing Zhu was superficial.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang found his own path of cultivation, so he did not investigate further.</p><p>A thought struck him: If Qingzhu had really killed two Jindan masters from the Yuan Shen Men, even if he had already left Shao Hua Mountain, it was bound to have a huge impact on the relationship between the two major sects. </p><p>No wonder Shao Hua Mountain intentionally erased any trace of Senior Qingzhu. </p><p>However, Senior Qingzhu had been able to kill Jindan masters? The incomplete version of the "Nascent Soul Forging Sword Chapter" could only be cultivated up to the early Jindan stage. Did he change his cultivation method to something else? </p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, and pondered for a moment before asking the Le sisters, "The owner of the cave dwelling you found, he died at the hands of the Sword Demon?"</p><p>"That's right. The owner of the cave dwelling was called True Person Cang Li, and his cultivation base was at the Foundation Establishment stage. During that time, he was a somewhat famous independent cultivator who had also entered the Immortal Mansion. Although no one saw him being killed by the Sword Demon, after that, True Person Cang Li simply disappeared. No one has ever seen him again. Then later everyone discovered that all who entered the Immortal Mansion, even if they weren't publicly executed, their bodies were gradually found, and they had all died at the hands of the Sword Demon. True Person Cang Li was among them. My sister and I discovered this cave dwelling by chance. Later, after investigating from multiple sources, we determined that it was True Person Cang Li's cave dwelling. Unfortunately, the cave dwelling is covered with layers of enchantments. My sister and I had no way of breaking through them, so we had to ask Senior Qin for help." </p><p>Le Xing looked expectantly at Qin Sang. "As long as Senior Qin agrees, we'll leave this tree root with Granny Jing. After the cave dwelling's enchantments are broken, the tree root will belong to Senior Qin." </p><p>Qin Sang showed no emotion. He considered it for a moment before saying, "Since the two of you discovered the cave dwelling, you must have tried to probe it. What kind of enchantments are there? How powerful are they? Can you tell me about it?" </p><p>"Of course." </p><p>Le Xing saw that Qin Sang's tone had softened, and her expression grew somewhat excited as she said, "True Person Cang Li's cave dwelling was extremely well-hidden. It's concealed deep underwater. If not for an accident, my sister and I wouldn't have been able to discover it either. His cave dwelling is built on an underwater hill, and the hill is surrounded by a water-element enchantment. This enchantment is not only unusually sturdy, but also has a fierce counterattack function. Only Foundation Establishment stage cultivators can withstand it. My sister and I tried to probe it many times but had no way of getting through. We've already had two defensive magic tools destroyed, and we almost died in front of the enchantment. However, we haven't returned empty-handed. From what we've observed, True Person Cang Li's cave dwelling should only have this one layer of protective enchantments. As long as we can break this one, there shouldn't be any danger inside."</p>
