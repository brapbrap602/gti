<h1>Chapter 326: Sheepskin</h1><p>Chapter 326: Sheepskin</p><p>The auction began at nightfall and it's now well past midnight.</p><p>Having obtained the Soul-Guiding Grass, Qin Sang no longer hesitated and confidently participated in the bidding.  He spent most of his spirit stones, but before the auction ended, he managed to buy several types of spirit wood and a top-tier magical artifact called the Yellow Sand Banner.</p><p>Money spent, money earned. Investing spirit stones in enhancing one's strength is the right path; hoarding them won't make them multiply.</p><p>This artifact requires no preparation; upon infusing it with spiritual energy, it creates a domain of raging sand. Within the Yellow Sand Domain, a storm of sand engulfs everything, with sand and dust swirling wildly and shifting constantly.</p><p>Opponents caught within the sandstorm will have their spiritual sense affected, leading to a feeling of haziness, limiting their perception to a small area around them, much like being trapped in an illusionary array.</p><p>The drawback is that once deployed, the banner cannot be moved, otherwise, the Yellow Sand Domain will collapse.  Furthermore, the artifact itself doesn't possess powerful offensive capabilities.</p><p>Qin Sang spent 3,000 spirit stones on this artifact for a specific reason. His current combat strategy is based on the artifacts he possesses.</p><p>In his arsenal, the Silver Knife Talisman and the Ten Directions Yama Banner both require time to prepare.</p><p>Therefore, gaining the upper hand in a surprise attack is ideal.  If a surprise attack is impossible, or if he is ambushed, and his corpse puppet and ebony sword are insufficient to deal with the opponent, he can only use the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman to escape, putting distance between himself and his enemy, preparing his treasures, and then seeking an opportunity to counterattack.</p><p>But if the opponent is fully prepared, and there's no chance of escape, Qin Sang would be in a difficult spot.</p><p>The Yellow Sand Banner serves as a perfect supplement. Qin Sang doesn't need to kill the enemy, he just needs to make them wary and hesitant to launch a full-scale attack, allowing him to hide within the sandstorm to buy time to prepare his talismans or ghost banner.</p><p>Besides that, most of the spirit wood Qin Sang acquired was traded with other cultivators who participated in the auction but lacked sufficient spirit stones, and sold their spirit wood on the spot.</p><p>Including the Falling Phoenix Vine and the Pointing Water Wood, after absorbing them, the ebony sword still isn't strong enough to support a third killing talisman, but at least, its strength won't be limited by his cultivation for a short while.</p><p>Qin Sang was very satisfied with his gains. The items auctioned later became increasingly expensive, and knowing he couldn't afford them, he calmly watched, waiting for the auction to end, participating in the secret market afterward, before leaving Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>Precious treasures appeared one after another, pushing the excitement to new heights.</p><p>The cultivators’ enthusiasm was thoroughly ignited.</p><p>As the auction neared its end, the items became even more valuable, leading to fierce competition.  The frenzied atmosphere threatened to blow the roof off. Among the items was even a live Sky Cloud Eagle妖兽 egg!</p><p>The Sky Cloud Eagle is a powerful flying妖兽. Upon reaching adulthood, it possesses the strength of a妖灵-stage cultivator, and has a chance to further breakthrough.</p><p>妖兽 eggs are incredibly rare and valuable.</p><p>Raising a Sky Cloud Eagle from a young age ensures a loyal spiritual beast; unless forcibly subdued as an adult, they rarely betray their master.</p><p>Sky Cloud Eagles are incredibly fast, swift as the wind.</p><p>Their bodies are strong, especially their claws, which are exceptionally sharp, comparable to magical artifacts.</p><p>They are rare and valuable spiritual beasts, whether as companions or mounts.</p><p>Among the belongings of Elder Di Que, the notes left by that Golden Core cultivator from the Imperial Spirit Sect included methods for raising Sky Cloud Eagles. With proper cultivation, there’s a significant chance of allowing it to break through to the late妖灵 stage, equivalent to the combat power of a late Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Seeing the Sky Cloud Eagle egg, Qin Sang was naturally very tempted, but after bidding twice, he was scared off by the intense competition. Unless he also put the Blood-Dropping Ghost Mushroom up for sale, the remaining spirit stones he possessed wouldn't be enough.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang knew he wouldn't do that.</p><p>Firstly, the Sky Cloud Eagle has a long growth period, and raising one is very troublesome, it would definitely affect Qin Sang's own cultivation; he didn't have the energy to focus on raising a Sky Cloud Eagle.</p><p>Even if the Sky Cloud Eagle grew to adulthood, Qin Sang might have already formed his Golden Core by then, making a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator's strength insignificant.</p><p>Secondly, Qin Sang could refine corpse puppets as assistants, so he didn't need a spiritual beast that urgently.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang still felt a little regret.  It was the so-called immortal aura.</p><p>His dream of flying on a sword had already come true.</p><p>When could he achieve the carefree life of riding a crane and traveling down the Yangtze River?</p><p>Following the Sky Cloud Eagle egg, a series of valuable pills, three talisman treasures, and two sets of prohibition artifacts appeared, pushing the excitement to its peak.</p><p>Finally, a set of forty-nine mother-and-child array flags, capable of serving as a protective mountain gate formation, was auctioned off as the final item, purchased by that Daoist priest at an astonishing price, after which, the girl did not reappear from the darkness.</p><p>Just as everyone thought the auction was about to end, leaving them wanting more,</p><p>Gao Yi smiled and announced, "Thank you all for your enthusiastic participation.  This auction has been a great success, and I have fulfilled the City Lord's trust. However, there's one more matter. Please bear with me for a moment.  The Golden Water Formation was scheduled as the final item, but a Foundation Establishment cultivator heard about the auction and, on a whim, wishes to contribute a treasure. Whether you can seize this opportunity and obtain this treasure depends entirely on your skill!"</p><p>In the midst of surprised gazes, Gao Yi turned and bowed slightly towards the darkness, respectfully saying, "Senior, please entrust the treasure to me."</p><p>As soon as Gao Yi finished speaking, a buzzing sound filled the hall, and everyone was astonished.</p><p>It's said that after the Stone Island Trade Fair, there's a special auction for Foundation Establishment cultivators in Yin Shan Pass, renowned throughout Xiao Han Domain, filled with countless rare treasures and surrounded by numerous legends.</p><p>Why would this Foundation Establishment cultivator skip that auction to join this one?</p><p>It must be acknowledged that the gap between even the strongest pseudo-Nascent Soul cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage and Foundation Establishment cultivators remains insurmountable. Even someone as powerful as Gao Yi can only address him as a senior.</p><p>Except under special circumstances, the difference in strength directly determines one's wealth.  No matter how precious an item, it's difficult to fetch a price that would satisfy a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>However, after their initial surprise, the crowd was overwhelmingly excited!</p><p>Coming from a Foundation Establishment cultivator and treated with such care by Gao Yi, it was certainly no ordinary treasure.</p><p>Gao Yi bowed and waited patiently. After a moment, a ripple appeared in the darkness, and a wooden box slowly floated out.</p><p>Gao Yi carefully received the box, surveyed the room, and under countless expectant gazes, gently opened it, tilting it slightly to reveal its contents.</p><p>To everyone's astonishment, the box didn't contain a powerful magical artifact or talisman treasure, nor rare elixirs or medicines.  It contained something simple and unremarkable.</p><p>A piece of sheepskin!</p><p>The sheepskin emitted no radiant light and bore no inscription; it looked utterly ordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had initially been watching with amusement, felt a sudden jolt upon seeing the sheepskin. His eyes narrowed slightly beneath his mask, and he unconsciously sat up straight.</p><p>This piece of sheepskin was strikingly similar to the one he had taken from the black-robed cultivator by the Sunken River!</p>
