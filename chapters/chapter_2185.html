<h1>Chapter 2175: The Great Subduing Dragon Spell</h1><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>…</p><p>As Qin Sang and his companions sped through the air, bursts of shimmering light continued to erupt around them, like a continuous fireworks display.  The grey figures relentlessly pursued them, fearless and seemingly immortal.</p><p>Qin Sang avoided using his most powerful techniques. He wielded the Grey Warbler Sword with dazzling skill, occasionally supplementing it with thunder talismans. He had to protect himself, Chen, and Liuli, a perilous balancing act.</p><p>Fortunately, Chen’s injuries had partially healed. His experience and perception allowed him to seize crucial moments. Their teamwork steadily improved.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword sliced through the air.  A grey figure, entangled with Qin Sang, was about to be bisected and attempted to retreat.  At that instant, Chen's eyes widened, his expression resembling an enraged Vajrayana deity. He roared, "Halt!"</p><p>The grey figure’s sword light abruptly stopped, as if suppressed by an immense force, rendered immobile.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sword light struggled wildly, to no avail.</p><p>The moment was fleeting.  As the Grey Warbler Sword approached, the grey figure manifested armor similar to the Bright Mountain Armor and flicked out a thunder talisman – a Grand Supreme Thunderbolt Talisman.</p><p>The talisman unleashed heavenly thunder, striking the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Sword and thunder collided before the grey figure. The shockwave sent it flying.  Protected by the Bright Mountain Armor and the defensive techniques learned from Qin Sang, it remained unharmed, but utterly disheveled.</p><p>After the clash with the thunder, the Grey Warbler Sword instantly redirected its trajectory. A flash of light, and it appeared above another grey figure.</p><p>The spirit sword descended, its sharpness unparalleled!</p><p>Simultaneously, a gust of icy wind swept past, freezing a layer of ice onto a grey figure. Liuli had attacked.</p><p>Qin Sang had been observing Liuli.  Though she had cultivated the Supreme Forgetfulness Path, she still primarily used ice-based techniques, now refined and subtle. She seamlessly integrated the power of the Ice Soul Divine Light into her spells.</p><p>The grey figure currently under attack was the strongest, the one fixated on Chen.  Chen, bathed in golden light with a halo behind his head, remained calm despite the cracking ice on his body. With hands forming thunder seals, he calmly met the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chen targeted the last grey figure, a weaker imitation of Liuli, easily forced back by Chen’s Miro Palm technique.</p><p>Their attack was deliberate. In an instant, the three grey figures were clustered together. Two were unsteady, and the third was overwhelmed by the combined assault of Qin Sang and Liuli, momentarily immobilized.</p><p>Chen then crossed his legs, golden light illuminating his face. He resembled an ancient, weathered Buddha statue, exuding an aura of profoundness and antiquity.</p><p>A chant resonated, echoing like thunder, like relentless waves, accompanied by dragon roars, as if summoning true dragons.</p><p>These were genuine dragon roars.  Vast currents of air surged above the battlefield. Under Chen’s golden light, they transformed into two golden dragons, teeth bared, claws extended, lunging at the grey figures.</p><p>The golden dragons left golden trails, emitting strange ripples, resembling golden ropes.  Their movements formed a massive cage, trapping the three grey figures.</p><p>This was the Purple Cloud Mountain's secret technique, the Great Subduing Dragon Spell.  Its power lay in its ability to both imprison and attack. While a purely binding spell might trap them, the grey figures could escape through self-destruction and rebirth.  Chen had already used this spell against them before, so its reveal held no strategic consequence.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The two golden dragons soared, plunging into the fray.  A dazzling golden light erupted, showing the dragons fiercely clashing.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli launched a few more attacks, creating an opening for the three to retreat and put distance between themselves and the grey figures.</p><p>Fighting and retreating, they neared the edge of the densest light.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the horizon and saw a gap in the distance. He informed his companions, who felt immense relief.  With Qin Sang, they appeared safe, but any unforeseen event could disrupt the balance. If the grey figures possessed Qin Sang's full strength, the consequences were unimaginable.</p><p>If Guang Hai continues its expansion and the radiant light continues to affect the Sacred Land, their concern is no longer just the Heart Lake.  Now, they must consider how to survive the Sacred Land's transformation.</p><p>"To the right!"</p><p>Qin Sang spotted an opening and immediately ordered a change in direction.  Soon, Liuli and Liao Chen also saw the gap ahead.</p><p>Facing the relentless pursuit of the gray figures, they focused on defense, planning to deal with them after escaping the radiant light.</p><p>As the opening drew near, Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly, an inexplicable sense of unease washing over him. Before he could warn them, Liao Chen's escape light abruptly stopped, a bloody light appearing on his forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly noticed Liao Chen's change.  The bloody light pulsed like a living thing, yet it was clearly an illusion, eventually forming a bloodworm that attempted to burrow into Liao Chen's body.</p><p>The attack was sudden and incredibly strange; before they could react, Liao Chen was struck.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recognized it as a secret technique targeting the primordial spirit.  He coldly snorted, his consciousness surging outwards.</p><p>He didn't use any divine abilities or secret techniques, relying solely on the power of his consciousness to attack the bloodworm. Unfortunately, he was too late, watching helplessly as the bloodworm burrowed into Liao Chen's forehead.</p><p>He couldn't recklessly unleash his consciousness into Liao Chen's body, so he had to stop.</p><p>Liao Chen, unable to resist the bloodworm's intrusion, turned deathly pale, his golden eyes tinged with an eerie bloody glow.</p><p>During the attack, Qin Sang looked around.  The Tianmu butterfly, which had been secretly guarding them, had failed to detect the attacker.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang noticed something – a tiny bloodstain, almost invisible, on a rock shattered by the radiant light.  It was the size of a speck of dust, blending seamlessly with the rock's fragments.</p><p>The bloodstain itself emitted no aura; only when Qin Sang witnessed the bloodworm's birth did he realize its abnormality – it was likely a bloodworm egg.</p><p>If there were two eggs, there could be a third, or even more.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly discovered over a dozen blood eggs scattered near and far, some even outside the radiant light.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Qin Sang silently channeled his thunder techniques, summoning silver serpents from the sky to strike the eggs.</p><p>The instant the first egg was struck by lightning, a brilliant light flashed in Qin Sang's eyes as he finally spotted the enemy!</p><p>However, before Qin Sang could act, an egg outside the radiant light exploded into a bloody aura, transforming into a blood-like figure.  The figure seemed to be composed of blood mist, its features indistinct, its aura vague. Only a pair of wings on its back were visible.</p><p>The blood figure let out a soft gasp, its icy gaze falling on Qin Sang.  "Excellent eyesight," it complimented.</p><p>Its gaze then shifted to Liao Chen, turning slightly colder.</p><p>The blood figure chanted a strange incantation.  Liao Chen's eyes blazed with bloody light, his mouth letting out low growls, his face contorted in a whirlwind of emotions he couldn't control.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang pieced together the events.</p><p>They were surrounded by the radiant light and pursued by the gray figures, making it impossible to conceal their battle.  The enemy, noticing their relatively low cultivation, targeted them, aware of Liao Chen's previous injuries. They set an ambush, striking when they saw a chance during the brief respite outside the radiant light, catching Liao Chen off guard.  It's important to note that Liao Chen's primordial spirit had suffered significant damage previously, which complicated his recovery and made him more vulnerable.</p><p>There was another reason for this ambush location: entering the radiant light would also attract the gray figures, exposing their position.</p><p>In the Sacred Land, it's a struggle for opportunities, not about right or wrong.  Even if strangers with no prior grievances encounter each other, an opportunity will trigger an attack.</p><p>Judging by the blood figure's abilities, it was likely a late-stage Refinement Void cultivator, proficient in the ways of the primordial spirit.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A piercing sound ripped through the radiant light.</p><p>They had reached its edge.  The moment the blood figure appeared, Qin Sang led Liuli and Liao Chen in a frantic dash outwards.</p><p>Once outside the radiant light, the Gray Warbler Sword slashed swiftly, instantly eliminating two of the gray figures.</p><p>The remaining gray figure possessed comparable strength to Liao Chen, not something that could be dealt with quickly. Qin Sang sent a mental message to Liuli, instructing her to protect Liao Chen while she engaged the figure.  With Liao Chen revealing his weakness and Liuli taking a defensive stance, they could still stall the gray figure for a while; as a last resort, she could unleash the Heavenly Emperor's Command Talisman.</p><p>Liao Chen's face grew paler, his breathing shallow.  Xue Ying stared intently into Liao Chen's eyes, uttering strange murmurs mixed with incantations. The incantations emanated from a jade pendant at Liao Chen's waist, a Buddhist artifact, likely mitigating the severity of his condition.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn't immediately try to save Liao Chen.  His gaze, sharp as a sword, remained fixed on the Xue Ying in the sky.  Having dealt with the gray figures, he seized the opportunity. A sword cry drowned out all other sounds as his sword flashed through the air.</p><p>Since the blood egg had been struck by lightning, a faint blood mist had permeated the void, possessing a viscous quality.  The sword pierced it like sinking into mud.  But Qin Sang cultivated the Way of Sword Formations; he wouldn't be so easily stopped.</p><p>Darkness enveloped the battlefield, stars twinkling above.  As starlight flickered, star demons were born, three of them merging into one before striking down with thunderous force!</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>The murmurs ceased. Xue Ying looked up, sensing the power of the formation, a note of surprise in its voice.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A blood-red cloth flew from Xue Ying's embrace, transforming into a blood cloud above its head, drawing in the surrounding blood mist.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>The sword light struck the blood cloud, causing it to churn violently. A sword mark appeared at its center, as the blood cloud surged inward.</p><p>Before the sword light could fully descend, Xue Ying violently flapped its wings, its form shattering into countless afterimages.</p><p>Unlike the previous blood egg, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's ability finally proved effective against these afterimages. Qin Sang instantly identified the true form.  He had secretly activated the altar, and the sound of rolling thunder echoed. A green thunder seal appeared above Xue Ying's true form, followed by descending bolts of lightning, allowing no respite.</p><p>This burst of power from Qin Sang far exceeded Xue Ying's expectations. Caught off guard, and sensing the power of the green thunder, Xue Ying stiffened. Its wings vibrated, releasing a dark light.</p><p>Within the darkness, a long feather was enveloped, seemingly from some kind of spirit bird.  Its filaments were distinct, its luster flowing, emitting strange energy.</p><p>The feather ignited, burning with a black flame.  The next moment, as the feather burned out, a clear, long cry echoed from the flames, revealing a spirit bird phantom.</p><p>The bird, formed entirely of black fire, spread its wings and flew towards the green thunder.  It raised its neck high, opening its beak as if to swallow the thunder.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>In the violent collision, the spirit bird reformed into a ball of black fire.  Green thunder and black fire mingled in the sky, consuming each other's power.</p><p>Below the clash of thunder and fire, a radiant glow spread. The battlefield lay at the edge of this light, which continued to expand. Though Xue Ying had survived, it was still impacted, unable to fully avoid the glow.</p><p>Touched by the glow, gray figures appeared beside Xue Ying.</p><p>"Impressive skills! I underestimated you. We shall meet again! Haha..."</p><p>Xue Ying shattered the gray figures with a backhand strike, letting out a few boastful laughs before retreating.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly, secretly regretting it.  Forcing Xue Ying into the radiant light was intentional; strategically utilizing the battlefield environment is key to victory.  However, Xue Ying hadn't revealed its full strength against the gray figures.  A combined assault would have exacted a greater price.</p><p>Furthermore, they had only just escaped the radiant light, and were far from safety.  The light would soon close in, and continued fighting would force Qin Sang to reveal his full power.</p><p>For the long term, Qin Sang had no choice but to stop, watching Xue Ying flee.</p><p>Fortunately, Liao Chen's condition gradually improved after Xue Ying's departure.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his sword, and he and Liuli killed the last gray figure, then carried Liao Chen, escaping the closing gap.</p><p>The gaps ahead widened, allowing for maneuverability as the radiant light thinned around them.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed their presence and found a safe place. "How is the monk?"</p><p>Liao Chen shook his head slightly, his face bitter. His injuries were not healed, and he had been targeted by a master of spiritual attacks. Thanks to Qin Sang, otherwise he would have been in mortal danger.</p><p>He absorbed Qin Sang's True Qi, took several pills, and managed to stabilize his injuries before regaining consciousness. He saw Qin Sang and Liuli still fleeing, occasionally glancing behind them.</p><p>The radiant light was gradually fading, but something worse happened. The light sea absorbed this glow, swallowing the land and expanding behind them.</p><p>The Heart Lake was gone.  What would they do now?</p><p>"I have a theory about the Heart Lake's location," Qin Sang said, looking at them.</p>
