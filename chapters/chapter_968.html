<h1>Chapter 960: The Xuanjia Talisman</h1><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly.  He flickered, disappearing into the woods.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the newcomer's figure flashed, seeming to have discovered Qin Sang's trail, and also flew into the woods.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Two figures burst from the forest, confronting each other in mid-air.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grim.  Secretly, he summoned his ebony sword, staring intently at the figure ahead.</p><p>The person appeared to be a handsome young man with an ethereal air, his long hair tied back with a ribbon of unknown material, falling naturally.</p><p>His eyes were an unusual shade of green, their movement strangely captivating.</p><p>“Friend, you’ve finally arrived. You're a bit late; we've been waiting for a while. Fortunately, it hasn't affected the important matter; otherwise, the Great King would have punished you.”</p><p>The long-haired youth sized Qin Sang up, his eyes twinkling as he smiled slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>He had sensed an approaching presence, thinking it was another cultivator battle he might be drawn into, so he fled into the forest.  Yet the youth easily found him, forcing his appearance.</p><p>Confirming there were no pursuers behind the youth, Qin Sang felt a strong sense of foreboding, suspecting the youth might be planning to kill him and steal his treasures.</p><p>However, he wasn't panicked.</p><p>The youth's cultivation was strong, at least a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.  As long as the other party wasn't a Nascent Soul master, Qin Sang was confident he wasn't weaker.</p><p>Qin Sang had already activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation, secretly summoning his ebony sword, ready to strike first. But then he heard the youth's words.</p><p>“You have the wrong person!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, replying coldly.</p><p>“Impossible,” the youth shook his head repeatedly, his face full of certainty.  “Friend, your demonic aura isn’t fake! Those human cultivators, using the bodies of our demonic kin to refine the Demonic煞妖 pills, also carry a faint demonic aura.  But it’s different from ours. Only our kin can tell the difference. Even without the token, can't you tell that our demonic auras are equally pure?”</p><p>“Demon Clan?”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was greatly shocked, his body tensing.</p><p>Demonic transformation varies in difficulty and the required cultivation level between different clans.  But even the fastest need to reach the Transformation stage before transforming, which is how the stage got its name.</p><p>This person looked human, yet claimed to be a demon. Could he be a transformed demon beast?</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the youth, his mind racing.</p><p>The youth couldn't be a beast from the Demon Sea. The teleportation arrays between the two regions were controlled by both clans, guarded by Nascent Soul cultivators; it was impossible for a transformed demon beast to enter their territory to cause trouble.</p><p>Although the Canglang Sea was a cultivator's domain, countless sea beasts dwelled there, especially in the remote north sea. Many beasts lurked in those uncharted waters.</p><p>The appearance of a transformed demon beast wasn't surprising.</p><p>Who would have thought a transformed demon beast would dare enter the Seven Killing Hall, without fearing being discovered and killed by cultivators of both races?</p><p>This person seemed to have mistaken him for a demonic beast, probably because of the Heavenly Demon Transformation.</p><p>In the Demon Sea, Qin Sang had discovered that after cultivating the Heavenly Demon Transformation, his demonic aura grew stronger, making the beasts in the swarms treat him as one of their own, greatly reducing their hostility.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Heavenly Demon Transformation's demonic aura to be so pure, capable of deceiving even a transformed demon beast.</p><p>What was even more shocking to Qin Sang was that he didn't feel any pressure from a transformed demon beast from this person. He looked like a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>This meant the other's cultivation was far more terrifying than he imagined!</p><p>What kind of being was the Great King he spoke of?</p><p>Qin Sang was startled by his own thoughts.</p><p>Could there be other top-tier beings hidden in the Seven Killing Hall?</p><p>He dared not make any sudden moves. If his disguise was discovered, he would have no way to escape death.</p><p>Inside the Corpse Puppet bag, Bai was also tense, motionless, his expression shifting between anger and fear.  He cursed inwardly, “He’s a disaster! A cursed star!”</p><p>Bai deeply regretted traveling with such a person.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his unease, carefully choosing his words, and asked in a low voice, “Where is your token, friend?”</p><p>The youth sighed, “In a foreign land, your caution is understandable.  Why don’t you take out the Xuanjia Talisman and let’s see?”</p><p>The youth took out an object from his waist and showed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>The object was only palm-sized, a tortoise shell amulet made from a Xuan Turtle shell.  The front had natural markings, while the back had engraved runes.</p><p>Seeing this object, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity, immediately recalling where he had seen it before.</p><p>Within Qian Jun's ring, there's a similar tortoise shell talisman!</p><p>He first encountered it in Qisha Hall.  Guided by his bone flute, he tracked down a man with a hooked nose, killed him, and obtained not only the flute and star snail, but also this tortoise shell talisman.</p><p>At the time, he tried several times to activate the runes on it without success. Sensing its aura, he felt it wasn't of human origin, so he treated it as a rare artifact and put it away.</p><p>The man before him also possesses one, calling it a Xuanjia Talisman.</p><p>Could the hooked-nosed cultivator he killed be connected to this transformed demon?  But the man didn't seek revenge, instead calling him "Dao You" (fellow cultivator), a strange action that puzzled Qin Sang.</p><p>While Qin Sang pondered,</p><p>the young man, suspended in mid-air, swiftly drew several runes and sent them towards the Xuanjia Talisman.</p><p>The runes disappeared into the talisman.</p><p>Instantly, the Xuanjia Talisman glowed bright green, and a tiny, thumb-sized image of a dragon emerged, swimming within.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang's own Xuanjia Talisman in his Qiankun ring reacted.</p><p>He quickly took it out, and saw the same change occurring—two tiny dragons, seemingly sensing each other, attempted to break free from their talismans and fly towards each other.</p><p>“So you are from the Biqiu Clan! I’m glad you showed mercy.  Even with my dragon form, I wouldn’t dare to easily touch Biqiu poison. You carry the aura of a Qingluan, a trace of Qingluan blood, I presume?  A rare Qingluan descendant!  I never thought the Biqiu Clan would send someone like you.  I call myself Yuanzhu in the Canglang Sea; what is your name, Dao You…?”</p><p>To Qin Sang, the two dragon spirits within the talismans seemed identical, yet the young man somehow noticed a difference. He smiled slightly and said:</p><p>“With the Xuanjia Talisman, you should rest assured.” The young man smiled warmly.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at his talisman, feeling something was amiss.</p><p>Especially hearing the young man claim to be from the Biqiu Clan, reminding him of the hooked-nosed man’s luminous wings and the green poisonous smoke before his death.</p><p>After a moment's silence, Qin Sang put away his talisman, covertly observing the young man, and said: “It’s Yuanzhu Dao You.  I call myself Mingyue.  Besides you, are there any other Dao You here?”</p>
