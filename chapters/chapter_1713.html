<h1>Chapter 1704:  Nourishing the Spirit Technique</h1><p>The black threads were the very essence of the demonic fire.</p><p>Since settling in Luye, Qin Sang had dedicated himself to secluded cultivation, rarely leaving his cave abode.  Not only were his injuries steadily improving, but his spiritual sense had also progressed remarkably. He had almost completely absorbed and refined the Near-Dragon Saliva, and with its power, the bottleneck in the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique had begun to loosen.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang focused all his energy on cultivating this secret technique.</p><p>A fire lotus hovered before Qin Sang's brow, an invisible connection existing between them, extending to his brow and even his Purple Mansion.</p><p>The Mani bead was close to the fire lotus, and the strands of demonic fire essence, like fish evading capture, continuously darted within the bead's fiery red interior.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the demonic fire essence, lost in thought.</p><p>He had maintained this posture for several months.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang had continuously analyzed the power within the demonic fire essence, patiently untangling it, absorbing and refining it bit by bit, finally separating these black threads, and then reaching an impasse.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't say for sure whether these were the essence of the demonic fire or something else.  What he could be certain of was that the demonic fire's original owner must have controlled it through these black threads.</p><p>He could feel that his spiritual sense had reached its limit, the peak of the Nascent Soul stage. Only one step remained before he could enter a new realm.</p><p>The next step was to refine one or several of the black threads to break through the bottleneck!</p><p>For months, Qin Sang had continuously refined his approach, greatly depleting his mental energy.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes flickered, his expression turning grave as he made his decision. He separated several spirit flames from the fire lotus, which descended and encircled the Mani bead.</p><p>The black threads within the fiery red seemed to sense something and their movement suddenly accelerated.  But the spirit flames, originating from the same source as the fire lotus, were successfully guided by Qin Sang to extract three of the black threads.</p><p>That's right, Qin Sang intended to directly refine three black threads to force a breakthrough!</p><p>The Mani bead slowly descended to the ground and fell silent.</p><p>The fire lotus in front of Qin Sang was gone, replaced by a ring of fire. The three black threads were trapped within the flames. Qin Sang separated wisps of spirit flames, constantly approaching the black threads to probe them.</p><p>After a stick of incense had burned.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The fire ring suddenly contracted, the spirit flames coalescing like a gaping maw, swallowing the black threads!</p><p>Instantly, the cave was filled with raging flames. Black flames reflected on the walls, like clawing demons, terrifying to behold.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, instantly forming dozens of hand seals. The spirit flames gradually tightened, seemingly progressing smoothly. Unexpectedly, with a muffled boom, the tightly compressed spirit flames suddenly exploded, engulfing the cave in a sea of fire, and Qin Sang's figure was submerged in the waves of fire.</p><p>Within the sea of fire, the three black threads were most striking.  They seemed to be expanding, transforming from fine threads into thick cords, emanating a ferocious aura.</p><p>It was clear that the energy bursting from the black threads was incredibly terrifying, easily capable of leveling the cave.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was low, without a hint of panic.</p><p>With these words, the sea of fire instantly subsided, the spirit flames gathering. The fire lotus reappeared above the black threads, slowly rotating, its strange rhythm enveloping the threads, finally calming the raging power within.</p><p>Having stabilized the situation, Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, observing the black threads with a hint of joy, saying, “So that's it!”</p><p>No wonder refining the demonic fire essence was so difficult!</p><p>According to the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique's level classification, the first level was Fire Condensing Lotus Seed, the second level was Lotus Seed evolving into a bud, and the fire lotus blooming. The third level was Lotus transforming into a Lotus Platform.</p><p>The fire lotus petals were not fully bloomed, and there was still a long way to go before the third level, Lotus transforming into a Lotus Platform.</p><p>Even completely refining the demonic fire wouldn't reach the third level.  This secret technique had immense potential.</p><p>His foundation was in Dharma cultivation, not Spiritual cultivation. Cultivating *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, which wasn't closely connected to his own Dao, should have been easier, yet he had encountered one setback after another.</p><p>Now he finally understood that the bottleneck wasn't only related to himself, but also to the demonic fire.</p><p>The demonic fire essence actually still retained the mark of its original owner!</p><p>After countless years, the owner's aura in the mark had long been erased. For someone proficient in the Nine Nether Demonic Fire techniques, it would be easy to control the mark and make it their own.</p><p>But for Qin Sang, who aimed to devour the demonic fire, not erasing the mark made it incredibly difficult. Fortunately, the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* itself was extraordinary, and Qin Sang had also found Near-Dragon Saliva and other rare items to assist, finally uncovering the root cause. Otherwise, it would have taken an immense amount of energy and time to discover the problem.</p><p>Knowing the cause, the next steps would be much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his strategy, manipulating the Fire Lotus to envelop the black threads, guiding the mark to reveal itself. Then, he tried various methods to erode the mark, achieving significant progress in just one month.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The previous scene reappeared.</p><p>The spiritual fire engulfed the black threads.</p><p>This time, the energy within the black threads didn't explode.  Under Qin Sang's calming influence, it maintained a degree of stability. The black threads seemed to melt, diffusing within the spiritual fire.</p><p>The demonic fire energy within the black threads was incredibly pure and potent. The *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* greedily devoured it, ravenously consuming.</p><p>Simultaneously absorbing three black threads was beyond Qin Sang's capacity, but this was precisely what he desired. As the energy of the three black threads merged, his consciousness surged, pushing the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* to its limits!</p><p>Qin Sang's brows furrowed, a pain shooting through his forehead.</p><p>It wasn't damage to his primordial spirit, but the consequence of an instant, massive consumption of his consciousness.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, not daring to relax for a moment. His mind was clear and tranquil; he completely disregarded the feeling that his consciousness was like a bursting dam, threatening to dry up at any moment. He focused solely on executing the secret technique.</p><p>It felt like a mere instant, yet also like a very long time.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sudden stirring in his heart. He opened his eyes, starlight seemingly swirling within them, fixed intently on the spiritual fire before him.</p><p>The spiritual fire gradually ceased its churning, solidifying into a Fire Lotus, with new petals unfolding!</p><p>He shifted his gaze towards the cave entrance, his eyes seeming to pierce through the stone door. His consciousness had already passed through the protective formation of the cave and spread into the world beyond.</p><p>Back then, the manifestation of his consciousness was a monumental transformation.</p><p>This was no different.</p><p>In his ‘eyes,’ the world was vastly different than before. His spiritual awareness was sharper and more extensive.  Any minor change within the Deer Wilds was impossible to escape his perception. He seemed to ‘hear’ the flow of spiritual energy, yet could sense stillness within the extreme movement. Qin Sang experienced these sensations, while simultaneously reviewing his past.</p><p>With a slight movement of his thoughts, a gale swept outside the cave. White airflow swirled above the cave, gradually condensing into a humanoid phantom within the gale’s center.</p><p>The phantom had distinct features, a perfect likeness of Qin Sang!</p><p>Then, the phantom slowly opened its eyes, raised its hands, and looked down at them. Then it curled its fingers, attempting to manipulate the spiritual energy of the world.</p><p>A sensation of sluggishness and strain was transmitted. Qin Sang in the cave frowned, dispersing the phantom and gathering his consciousness.  He cultivated to restore himself to his peak state, sensing the strength of his consciousness.  It was not far from that of the Azure Fox Saint King and Hui Guang Saint, at least on par, a whole level up!</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced and attempted celestial harmony.</p><p>The result, however, was disappointing.</p><p>This suggests that the Ghost Mother’s theory of ‘entering the Dao’ wasn't unfounded. He used the *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter* to enter the Dao, his foundation was in Dharma cultivation. The transformation of his consciousness was certainly beneficial for future breakthroughs, allowing him to withstand the pressure of Heaven and Earth from Nascent Soul cultivators, but it couldn't allow him to truly sense Heaven and Earth.</p><p>The benefits brought by the enhanced consciousness were undoubtedly not limited to this.</p><p>A simple example: if Qin Sang were to enter the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect with his current strength, he would never have been oblivious to two Nascent Soul cultivators of different clans approaching Emperor Grant Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to leave the cave and test this. He continued to refine the remaining demonic fires within the cave.  Progress significantly increased after his breakthrough.</p><p>Less than a year passed.</p><p>The Mani Pearl returned to its original appearance.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was finally completely refined by Qin Sang!</p><p>At Qin Sang's instruction, the Deer Wilds had drifted to an uninhabited area in the western part of the Northern Wasteland.</p><p>He rose and left the cave, appearing in a barren wilderness.</p><p>The vegetation was lush, seeming like a fertile land, but in reality, it was ravaged periodically by the Nine Calamities of the Northern Wasteland.  It was unsuitable for life; not only was it deserted, even insects and beasts were scarce.</p><p>His brow flashed, and the Fire Lotus slowly flew out.</p><p>Two layers of petals had unfolded around the Fire Lotus, but the central bud remained tightly closed, containing immense power within the black lotus.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, releasing the Solar God Tree, intending to test which was more powerful, the Fire Lotus or the combined power of the six birds.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>Thunderous roars echoed across the barren land.</p><p>The entire wasteland, along with the surrounding peaks, trembled, terrifying all living creatures.</p><p>Qin Sang floated in the air above the wasteland, astonished as he looked at two bottomless pits below: one continuously spewing crimson flames, the other releasing a black flame dragon which circled Qin Sang for a moment before transforming back into the Fire Lotus.</p><p>His consciousness had greatly improved, and his control over the Solar God Birds had also enhanced. Though he couldn't reduce their energy consumption, he could now easily guide the direction of the six birds' attacks.</p><p>Of course, this was no match for the Fire Lotus. This fire was entirely under Qin Sang's control, as if it were an extension of his own body.  The consumption was far less, and it definitely possessed the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>However, Qin Sang made a direct comparison and found that even after completely refining the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the power of the Fire Lotus was still inferior to the combined power of the six birds.  This surprised Qin Sang and gave him a new understanding of the Southern Ming Li Fire.</p><p>The Fire Lotus hovered above Qin Sang's head, like a black crown.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang saw no cultivators disturbed by the phenomenon. He retracted the Fire Lotus, took a moment to recover his breath, and then a brilliant light erupted from his back as his phoenix wings spread wide.  With a thought, Qin Sang activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation, a blue light flashing behind his head as the Qingluan Dharma Image appeared.</p><p>After reaching the Yuan Ying stage, his physical body cultivation had not progressed, resulting in little change to the Qingluan Dharma Image; it remained unusually ethereal.</p><p>However, Qin Sang recalled that when his consciousness first took shape, he could initially manipulate the Qingluan Dharma Image, drawing upon the power of the lightning within its wings to enhance his lightning escape technique.</p><p>With his consciousness having undergone another transformation, would there be new changes?</p><p>Qin Sang immediately tried it. The Qingluan Dharma Image flickered, and a sudden clap of thunder erupted from its wings. Blue electric arcs danced between its feathers, blinding flashes of lightning, like molten thunder, nearly enveloping Qin Sang.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A deafening roar of thunder echoed, lightning splitting the sky, piercing the wasteland, and disappearing into the distant mountains.</p><p>After the lightning dissipated...</p><p>The lightning bolt had not returned. A humanoid-shaped crater appeared on a mountain outside the wasteland, the surrounding vegetation charred and cracked, the mountain nearly splitting apart.</p><p>Gasps of shock echoed from within.</p><p>Qin Sang crawled out, battered and bruised, feeling every inch of his body ache as if his flesh, blood, and bones were about to shatter.</p><p>As he expected, with his greatly improved consciousness and the Qingluan Dharma Image's enhancement, his lightning escape technique had indeed greatly improved.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he had acted impulsively, using the technique at full power, and now suffered the consequences. He quickly understood the reason.  The lightning escape technique drew upon the Qingluan's lightning power within the phoenix wings, not his own strength, thus placing a burden on his body. While the true energy consumption was secondary, the stagnation of the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique meant his physical body was only at the early Yuan Ying stage; while he could withstand it before, it now exceeded his physical limits.</p><p>This served as a warning: unless his physical body improved, he shouldn't use the lightning escape technique at full power except for escaping mortal danger.</p><p>However, even with restrained power, its speed surpassed anything he had achieved before. With the demon fire and the escape technique, he finally had a way to contend with Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he looked south, but he didn't intend to retrieve his avatar. He still harbored deep apprehension towards Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Luye changed course and drifted east.</p><p>Soon after, it stopped in a region of rolling mountains.</p><p>Standing at the entrance to Luye, Qin Sang looked down and saw several Daoist temples built on a mountaintop, with young Daoists in Daoist robes moving about inside.</p><p>Outside the temples stood a stone stele inscribed with "Lower Branch of Qingyang Temple".</p><p>This was the spiritual vein that Shen Chen and others had searched for throughout the Northern Wasteland.  They established a sect here, naming it the Lower Branch of Qingyang Temple, with only disciples who reached a certain level allowed to know about and enter Luye for cultivation.</p><p>The disciples' cultivation time was still short, and their realms were very low.</p><p>But under the management of Shen Chen, the Mingyue Guard, and others, after receiving several batches of talented disciples, a flourishing atmosphere was taking shape.  The Qingyang Temple in Zhongzhou had another advantage: as long as Luye remained, it would eventually prosper.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>Shen Chen, leading the Mingyue Guard, flew up to Luye, kneeling and prostrating themselves. Their cultivation had improved.</p><p>"From now on, focus on cultivating and breaking through to Yuan Ying. Leave the mundane affairs to your disciples..."</p><p>After giving some instructions, Qin Sang ordered the Mingyue Guard to focus on hunting down the ferocious beasts before returning to his cave dwelling.</p><p>He naturally longed to obtain the Four Saints Gathering Spirit Array and cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Mirror Scripture*, but he had to be patient. He needed to wait for the ferocious beast to appear and for the Nascent Soul cultivator to be occupied hunting it before he could recall his avatar!</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling...</p><p>While cultivating, Qin Sang began to meticulously study the *Panhu True Scripture*.</p><p>With the precious advice left by the Ghost Mother and his previous experience, he could overcome the difficulties encountered in studying this scripture.  Without any unforeseen circumstances, he could begin modifying and cultivating this scripture!</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed...</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes and looked at the Sky Eye Butterfly on his left shoulder.</p><p>After absorbing almost all of the dragon marrow, the Sky Eye Butterfly had also received immense benefits; its cultivation had progressed faster than in the previous two hundred years, and it hadn't even fully absorbed the energy of the dragon marrow.</p><p>"After modifying the *Panhu True Scripture* and using the Spirit Nourishing Technique, combined with the pills collected by my avatar, the Sky Eye Butterfly will soon break through to the late fourth transformation stage, catching up with me..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, planning his future cultivation.</p><p>In the *Panhu True Scripture*, the Spirit Nourishing Technique is the most important core secret technique. Combining blood refining, spiritual nourishment, secret medicines, and other various Wu tribe secret techniques, this technique allows for the rapid improvement of the cultivation of one's innate insect gu, allowing it to approach its master's strength.</p><p>This is the true meaning of the Wu sect's innate insect gu technique. The reason it's called the innate insect gu is because it can synergistically improve with its owner, mutually assisting each other, which is the biggest difference from other spirit insects.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang had not received true instruction in the Canglang Sea, which limited the Sky Eye Butterfly's progress.</p><p>Now, all difficulties have been overcome.</p><p>"Let's begin..."</p><p>Qin Sang mentally summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly gently touched Qin Sang's cheek and flew into his dantian.</p>
