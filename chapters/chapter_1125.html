<h1>Chapter 1117: A Century-Old Friendship</h1><p>"How is your Grandmaster doing?" Qin Sang asked with concern upon hearing that Yun Youzi was in a hurry to enter seclusion.</p><p>"Don't worry, Uncle. Grandmaster isn't injured. It seems he has gained new insights and needs to retreat to fully comprehend them," Li Yufu replied.</p><p>Without delay, the two of them flew straight back to the cave abode. Tan Yien and Bai Hanqiu had been waiting for some time and immediately stepped forward to pay their respects. Yun Youzi was currently in deep meditation.</p><p>While waiting, Qin Sang took the opportunity to resolve some cultivation-related doubts for Li Yufu and the other two. When they first met, Li Yufu had sensed that Qin Sang had only recently broken through to the mid-stage of the Golden Core realm. Yet, in just over a decade, Qin Sang had already advanced to the late-stage Golden Core realm. Unaware of the full story, Li Yufu and the others couldn't help but admire Qin Sang greatly.</p><p>As night fell, Qin Sang was in the middle of instructing Li Yufu in sword techniques when he suddenly stopped speaking.</p><p>"Brother Qin!" An elderly man in a long robe emerged from the cave and stood still, gazing at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Senior!" Qin Sang immediately rose to his feet.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a glance and, without a word, burst into hearty laughter that echoed through the heavens.</p><p>After paying their respects to Yun Youzi, Li Yufu and the other two quietly withdrew.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi sat facing each other. Qin Sang observed his old friend. Despite the passage of many years, Yun Youzi still looked as aged as ever. As Li Yufu had mentioned, his cultivation had reached perfection, just one step away from forming his Nascent Soul, surpassing even Qin Sang.</p><p>"I truly never thought I'd have the chance to see you again, Brother Qin!" Yun Youzi sighed with emotion.</p><p>The world of cultivation was unpredictable and fraught with danger. Every parting could be the last, especially since Qin Sang had been harmed by a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"When I left the Purple Micro Palace and didn't see you, I had a bad feeling. Later, I lurked near Mount Shaohua and, after much inquiry, happened to meet Mu Yifeng. That's when I learned about the incident at the Black Tower. Although you escaped the clutches of evil, you disappeared without a trace. The Heavenly Mountain was shrouded in immortal restrictions, and I had no way to search for you..."</p><p>"I narrowly escaped with my life and, in doing so, encountered some fortuitous opportunities. It was a blessing in disguise..." Qin Sang recalled the events of that day with a sense of melancholy.</p><p>Despite the century that had passed, they could sense that each other's temperament had not changed significantly. Both had remained true to their original intentions, so there was no sense of estrangement between them.</p><p>"Who would have thought you'd have such an experience, with so many opportunities coming your way? In just over a hundred years, you've broken through to the late-stage Golden Core realm," Yun Youzi remarked, his eyes shining with admiration as he observed Qin Sang's cultivation level.</p><p>"Senior, you flatter me. Yufu told me that you reached the peak of the Golden Core realm many years ago. I still have a long way to go to catch up to you," Qin Sang replied modestly.</p><p>Yun Youzi waved his hand and said seriously, "I must thank you, Brother Qin, for helping me rise from the ashes..."</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently to the story.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, Yun Youzi had immersed himself in the Southern Brightness Fire, using the demonic flames to temper his soul. Several times, he had nearly been reduced to ashes by the Southern Brightness Fire, but with the help of the Three Lights Nectar and his own indomitable will, he had persevered, eradicated the hidden dangers, and been reborn.</p><p>Not long after leaving the Purple Micro Palace, Yun Youzi had successfully formed his Golden Core, and his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds.</p><p>"Senior, is that green bronze fragment still in your possession?" Qin Sang seized the opportunity to ask.</p><p>"It's with me. Do you need it, Brother Qin?" Yun Youzi took out the green bronze fragment from his storage pouch and asked curiously, "The green bronze fragment is a shard of an ancient treasure, but its former power has long since dissipated, and it cannot be reforged."</p><p>Qin Sang had been wanting to ask for Yun Youzi's opinion and explained, "I have an idea, but I'm not sure if it's feasible. Since the Southern Brightness Fire fears the green bronze fragment, perhaps we can use its power to subdue the spiritual fire and gain an astonishing divine ability."</p><p>"I see," Yun Youzi smiled upon hearing this. "I had a similar idea before, but after obtaining the green bronze fragment, I found it nearly impossible to achieve. If you have a good method, feel free to try it. This treasure was obtained through your daring efforts, so it rightfully belongs to you."</p><p>With that, Yun Youzi handed the green bronze fragment to Qin Sang without further ado and also gave him a jade slip containing his own insights.</p><p>"Then I shall accept it with gratitude," Qin Sang said, realizing that these insights would be of great help to him. He unceremoniously stored both items away.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi discussed the major events that had occurred in the Cold Domain over the past century. As a Golden Core cultivator, Yun Youzi provided a different perspective from Qing Jun.</p><p>"Brother Qin, you've taken on two disciples. Do you intend to establish your own sect?" Yun Youzi suddenly asked, changing the subject.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "They are descendants of old acquaintances. When I first returned, I urgently needed an identity to move about in the cultivation world. Later, I encountered a senior who, due to some past connections, took me under his wing. For now, I don't have to worry about my safety, so I'm focusing on cultivation. Yufu mentioned that you also wish to revive the Azure Goat Temple?"</p><p>"Not me, but Yufu," Yun Youzi shook his head. "He has always been the inheritor of the Azure Goat Temple. After you told me about Yufu's talent, I began to nurture this idea, deliberately keeping him at a distance from the Great Unity Pill Sect. Brother Qin, you also have deep ties to the Azure Goat Temple. Since you're considering establishing your own sect, why not let Yufu follow you in cultivation and continue the legacy of the Azure Goat Temple?"</p><p>"Forming a Nascent Soul is incredibly difficult. I don't even know what my chances are, so it's too early to talk about this," Qin Sang shook his head, sensing something unusual in Yun Youzi's tone. It almost felt like he was entrusting his legacy. "Senior, what do you mean? Are you planning to travel far?"</p><p>"Brother Qin, with your Five Element Spiritual Roots, you've come this far, and I've witnessed it firsthand. If you can't break through to the Nascent Soul realm, I don't know who else can," Yun Youzi seemed to have immense confidence in Qin Sang.</p><p>"It's not about traveling far. Over the years, while refining my cultivation, I've also been settling external matters and resolving various karmic ties. I'm preparing in advance for the Nascent Soul tribulation. Earlier, I sought out two old friends, intending to entrust Yufu to their care. But now that you've returned, no one is more suitable than you."</p><p>"Senior, are you really preparing to face the tribulation?" Qin Sang was both delighted and shocked.</p><p>He was shocked because the Nascent Soul tribulation was indeed terrifying. Unlike himself, who had the Jade Buddha and also practiced body refinement, Yun Youzi would have to rely solely on his own strength to withstand the inner demon tribulation. However, given Yun Youzi's temperament, he likely had no fear of the inner demon tribulation.</p><p>"Although the Nascent Soul tribulation is difficult, with your cultivation and mental fortitude, Senior, you will surely overcome it with ease," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Yun Youzi laughed heartily, "Thank you for your kind words, Brother Qin! I've made ample preparations and still need to refine a few spiritual pills. I estimate that within three to five years, I'll be ready to find a place to undergo the tribulation. I hope you can come and guard me then."</p><p>"Senior, rest assured. I will definitely be there in person," Qin Sang understood that as a mere Golden Core cultivator, he had no right to guard Yun Youzi during his tribulation. Yun Youzi was giving him the opportunity to observe the process, which would be of immense benefit.</p><p>"The Three Lights Nectar should be helpful for your tribulation. Unfortunately, over the years, I've used it multiple times to escape danger, and now there's only a thin layer left," Qin Sang took out a jade bottle, showing the scant remaining nectar, and said with regret.</p><p>"I remember you have the Nine Illusions Heavenly Orchid, which requires the Three Lights Nectar to mature..." Yun Youzi hesitated.</p><p>Upon hearing that the spiritual herb had already matured, his eyes lit up, and he unceremoniously took the jade bottle. "Thank you, Brother Qin! With this divine nectar, my chances of surviving the tribulation have increased!"</p>
