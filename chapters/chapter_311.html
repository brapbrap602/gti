# Chapter 304: The Unblemished Pearl


The man dressed in white sighed and shook his head, “The Yin-Yang Compass, that’s how Sheng Yuanzi died.”


However, no one sympathized with Ge Yuan.


When faced with adversity, everyone flees for their own safety. If Ge Yuan had simply wanted to save his own life, no one would blame him.


But this man had chosen the moment when the Head Devourers attacked in order to save himself. His intention was clear: he wanted to use the lives of the others to hold off the Head Devourers while he escaped.


Among those betrayed by him was Yunyouzi, who had saved his life.


If Yunyouzi had not completed the formation in time, the collapse of the Golden Halo Formation caused by Ge Yuan’s sudden departure would have lead to everyone’s death by the claws of the Head Devourers!


Ge Yuan had chosen his timing very well, but he had never expected to be targeted by Luo Xingnan. Using the Yin-Yang Compass, Luo Xingnan had played with him like a toy before throwing him in front of a Hooked Serpent King.


The serpent’s maw was just inches away, and the breath it exhaled was fetid in the extreme. But amidst the piercing stench, there was also a trace of intoxicating sweetness that came from the red mist.


Having long since learned the power of the red mist, Ge Yuan was shocked and quickly held his breath, not daring to inhale it into his body.


The weapon that Ge Yuan relied upon the most was a pair of Wu Hooks. These Wu Hooks were one large and one small, and each of them was either feminine or masculine.


At that moment, a scarlet serpent’s tongue appeared from the serpent’s maw and came within an inch of his face. How could Ge Yuan dare to hesitate for a moment? He hurriedly activated his weapon and fiercely struck out at the serpent’s maw.


Two streaks of sword light, one green and one red, shot out and pierced straight into the serpent’s maw.


The Hooked Serpent King reacted extremely quickly, and its serpent head suddenly swerved. Although it dodged the fate of having its brains pierced by the Wu Hooks, it paid the price of its serpent’s tongue being cut off.


The long serpent’s tongue flew far away, and fresh blood spurted out from the Hooked Serpent King’s maw.


The Hooked Serpent King was enraged by the pain, and its fierce eyes stared fixedly at Ge Yuan.


However, what Ge Yuan had done was exactly what Luo Xingnan wanted.


The Hooked Serpents were greatly weakened, and their numbers were not many. But these two Hooked Serpent Kings were extremely difficult to deal with. They worked together closely, and he had never found an opportunity to use his talisman treasure. He had been unable to escape for a long time, and he was already close to being at the end of his rope.


Fortunately, Ge Yuan had delivered himself to Luo Xingnan.


Of course, Ge Yuan could not have been a match for the Hooked Serpent Kings, but as long as he could attract their attention, block them for a moment, and break through their encirclement, that would be enough.


He could not miss this opportunity.


Luo Xingnan took a deep breath, and all of the spiritual energy in his body poured into the compass. He shot out a black light that forced the other Hooked Serpent King back a little, and he seized the opportunity to escape.


上官 Lifeng was doing his best to resist the Hooked Serpents, and his body had already been injured quite badly. When he saw what was happening, he immediately sheathed his saber and chased after Luo Xingnan.


Unexpectedly, Luo Xingnan saw that the Hooked Serpents were still pursuing him, and a cruel expression appeared on his face. He suddenly turned the Yin-Yang Compass upside down and aimed it at Shangguan Lifeng, who was chasing after him.


‘Swish!’


Shangguan Lifeng’s expression was somewhat stunned, as if he could not believe it. He had kept his promise, and he had been loyal to Luo Xingnan, but in the end, he had met with such a fate.


Immediately afterward, Shangguan Lifeng gave a resigned smile. He raised his saber and slashed out a saber qi to resist the black light, but his body was forced to stop. By the time the black light dissipated, the Hooked Serpent Kings were already within striking distance.


The change happened extremely quickly, like lightning or sparks. The situation had changed several times in just a few moments.


Luo Xingnan had left two lives behind, but he had actually managed to escape.


At this point, he no longer had to worry about exposure. Qin Sang was about to open his mustard seed bag and take out the Ten Directions Yama Banner in order to fight to the death.


At this moment, Yunyouzi’s expression was solemn as he looked at Qin Sang and said in a deep voice, “Little Brother Qin, the rest is up to you!”


Qin Sang was shocked, “Senior, you…”


He then saw a light gathering in front of Yunyouzi, and the Unblemished Pearl slowly rose up from the light. The scene of the cyclical generation and destruction of wind and thunder and the alternation of yin and yang was even more vivid, with every detail being clearly visible. It was extremely mysterious.


Yunyouzi had previously said that activating the Unblemished Pearl required him to exhaust his sea of qi, and he had clearly not been exaggerating. The spiritual energy in his body surged疯狂 into the Unblemished Pearl, and the violent fluctuations of spiritual energy were visible to the naked eye.


However, there was a big difference between this time and the last time in the underground magma. Yunyouzi’s spiritual energy was being absorbed by the Unblemished Pearl, but that was not all. It seemed that his vitality was also being absorbed!


Yunyouzi’s face, which had already been very old, was now as pale as a ghost, and there was not a trace of blood in it. The wrinkles on his face had deepened, and his aura was also declining at an astonishing rate, leaving him extremely weak.

His breath was weak, like a thread.
But then came a huge change in the Clear Bead.
Luo Xingnan, who was way afar, detected the abnormality here. He spared a quick glance and was totally amazed.
Qin Sang saw for the first time Cloud Wanderer unleash the full power of the Clear Bead.
The Clear Bead cast a brilliant light, with its dazzling azure light almost turning into a pale sun. A gust of狂暴 breath was emitted from the Clear Bead.
This breath was quite extraordinary, and it actually looked much like demonic energy. Sensing this breath, the serpent and the human-headed serpent both showed signs of irritability.
The white-robed scholar was extremely shocked and said, “This breath seems to be demonic energy. Could it be a magic weapon refined with demon pellets?”
Demon pellets were only formed in the bodies of demon beasts that had advanced into the Demon Core Period, like the golden core of human cultivators.
Demon beasts with demon pellets had strength comparable to cultivators in the Nascent Soul Period, and were equally rare.
However, neither demon pellets nor magic weapons refined with demon pellets were at a level that they, at the Foundation Establishment Period, could touch.
Qin Sang also had no idea if magic weapons could be refined with demon pellets, and thus could not with certainty discern exactly what the Clear Bead was.
He even suspected whether the Clear Bead could be a magic treasure.
But Qin Sang quickly denied his own conjecture — if the Clear Bead was truly a magic treasure, then Cloud Wanderer, who was not in the Nascent Soul Period, would have no way to use it.
The genuine Ten Yama Banners in Qin Sang's mustard seed bag were also magic treasures. He had tried using them many times, but had achieved nothing. The Primordial Unity Ring obtained from the relics of the Earthly Deficient Elder was also the same.
However, even if the Clear Bead was not a magic treasure, its powerful force was undeniable.
He wondered whether the Ten Yama Formation, created when ten ghost banners were gathered together, could rival the Clear Bead?
“Eeeh!”
The human-headed serpent’s call was filled with irritation. It suddenly flapped its giant wings and transformed into a black light, heading straight for Cloud Wanderer.
Qin Sang saw this and immediately dodged in front of Cloud Wanderer. He did not hesitate to use the power of the talisman treasure to its fullest.
All the reflections of the jade ruyi returned to Qin Sang’s palm, transforming into a handle as if it was real, like the most pure and beautiful piece of jade. Then Qin Sang raised his hand and the jade ruyi lightly quivered before transforming into a white light and shooting out.
At the same time, the Golden Hoop Formation given to the white-robed scholar was also activated.
This time, it was not an ambush, and the human-headed serpent was somewhat prepared.
The Golden Hoop Formation, which was now much less powerful, was torn apart by its claws, completely destroying this forbidden technique implement.
During the struggle, the talisman treasure also reverted to a talisman paper and fell from the sky as Qin Sang’s spiritual energy was depleted. There were countless cracks on it, and it was estimated that it could only be used one more time at most.
