<h1>Chapter 854: Message Talismans</h1><p>“Isn't this person Yue Xiangu's accomplice?”</p><p>Su Nü glanced at Qin Sang, seemingly lost in thought. She wondered whether he genuinely hadn't noticed or was feigning ignorance.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged.</p><p>The group returned to their meeting point, and Kong Yun arrived shortly after.</p><p>The mission had been relatively smooth. They successfully rescued Su Nü, and none of the four suffered any injuries. Everyone was overjoyed and immediately decided to return.</p><p>Since the Double-Headed Serpent was exposed, Qin Sang no longer concealed it, allowing it to stay outside and carry the weakest, Su Nü, back to Great Desolation Island.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang proactively approached Bamboo Mountain Elder, inquiring about the Falling Star Gate and Qi Yunzi. Bamboo Mountain Elder, intending to befriend Qin Sang, answered all his questions without reservation, revealing a lot of useful information.</p><p>Five experts, each equivalent to late-stage Core Formation, protected Su Nü. They returned to Great Desolation Island without incident.</p><p>A dark mass surrounded Great Desolation Island; the path ahead was blocked by a horde of beasts.</p><p>The number of妖beasts had multiplied countless times compared to when they left, obscuring the sky and sun. Powerful auras emanated from within the horde, clearly belonging to transformed Great妖, a chilling sight.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, everyone's hearts sank. Who would dare to cross the beast horde and return to Great Desolation Island at this time?</p><p>Yue Xiangu, however, appeared confident. She led them on a detour, and the beast hordes in other directions were surprisingly sparse. The two sides had formed opposing battle lines, and the seawater between them was stained red with blood, hinting at the intensity of the battle.</p><p>"Wait here!"</p><p>Yue Xiangu said calmly, "I received news earlier that various forces from the Inner Sea would send experts here. The cultivators on Great Desolation Island are no weaker than the beasts and won't just sit idly by.  We'll wait for their battle to begin and then take advantage of the chaos to enter.  I'll send a signal, and someone will come to meet us."</p><p>They had no choice but to wait patiently at a distance.</p><p>A few days later, the large-scale battle finally erupted.  They pushed forward together, and Yue Xiangu sent out the signal. As expected, they were met and safely escorted back.</p><p>"Three fellow Daoists, present this token at the Xiang'an Auction House to collect your reward."</p><p>Yue Xiangu handed each of them a jade token.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the token and bid farewell to the others.</p><p>Su Nü watched Qin Sang leave.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed her gaze but made no reaction. On the return journey, he had noticed Su Nü acting strangely, several times appearing as if she wanted to say something but ultimately remained silent.</p><p>He didn't rush to collect his reward and leave the Demon Sea. Instead, he first went to visit Elder Zou.</p><p>With the threat of Xiang Yi eliminated and his connection with the Qiongyu Trading Company re-established, he naturally wanted to maintain a good relationship.  Having the support of the Trading Company and the Merchant Alliance would be very convenient for future endeavors.</p><p>After visiting Elder Zou, Qin Sang set off for Great Desolation Island.</p><p>After several checks, Qin Sang entered Great Desolation City and retrieved two items from the Xiang'an Auction House, finally feeling a sense of relief.</p><p>At the auction house, he requested a private room and eagerly took out the Hairy Mountain Vine.</p><p>The Hairy Mountain Vine, known as the Azure Root among the妖, had a rough, textured outer skin, indeed resembling a green root. It was only the size of a fist, precisely the piece Xiang Yi had sent.</p><p>Qin Sang undid the restrictions on the spiritual herb. A green light brushed his face, and a rich medicinal aroma filled the air.</p><p>Each of the three spiritual herbs mentioned in the cultivation technique had different miraculous effects. The Azure Root could greatly strengthen bones and muscles, increase strength, and had a relatively mild effect.</p><p>Refining this spiritual herb now would significantly advance his *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, but for the sake of a breakthrough, Qin Sang could only resist the temptation, reseal the spiritual herb, and store it with the Tyrant Blood Fruit.</p><p>"Two of the three spiritual herbs have been collected, leaving only the Scorpion Venom Grass. However, there's still no news about this herb. I need a backup plan. Perhaps the Falling Star Gate can give me a pleasant surprise…"</p><p>Qin Sang held the teleportation talisman in his hand, deep in thought.</p><p>Besides the teleportation talisman, there was also a token.</p><p>Leaving the auction house, Qin Sang quickly walked towards the teleportation formation, wanting to leave as soon as possible to avoid any unforeseen complications.</p><p>Kong Yun and Bamboo Mountain Elder were nowhere to be seen. He wondered what their rewards were.</p><p>Countless guards formed a strong defensive force outside the teleportation hall. Qin Sang didn't dare to act recklessly here. He walked forward and presented the token.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is an old friend of General Mo. Please trouble fellow Daoist to deliver this to him."</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's cultivation level, the guard didn't dare to be negligent.  He returned shortly after and respectfully said to Qin Sang, "General Mo requests that you wait a moment in the Pacifying Demon Hall…"</p><p>At this time, entry and exit from the teleportation hall were prohibited.  Without orders, no one was allowed to activate the teleportation formation. Those wanting to leave Great Desolation Island had to follow instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent and followed the guard to the Pacifying Demon Hall, where he found several people already seated.</p><p>These people wore various attire. Some were meditating with their eyes closed, while others practiced Daoist techniques out of boredom. The hall was silent.</p><p>Their attire revealed the origins of most of them. They were disciples of major sects in the Inner Sea, each with an impressive aura and the arrogance to match.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, didn't see anyone familiar, and found a seat for himself.</p><p>More and more people arrived at the hall. The wait lasted for two hours until dusk, when the mysterious General Mo finally appeared and led everyone towards the teleportation hall.</p><p>Upon arriving at the teleportation hall, Qin Sang finally understood the strictness of the security here. Two white-haired elders in the hall were unexpectedly Nascent Soul Patriarchs!</p><p>Even the disciples of major sects could only lower their heads respectfully before the Nascent Soul Patriarchs.</p><p>"Senior Feng, these are the people sent by various forces today."</p><p>General Mo stepped forward, bowed, and whispered.</p><p>One of the elders suddenly slammed the table, his beard bristling with anger. "The Demon Sea is facing a life-or-death crisis, and our foundation is about to be destroyed. Yet, these forces, while speaking high-sounding words and keeping others here, rush to send their disciples back! Without experience, I'd like to see how many of them will amount to anything…"</p><p>"Alright, this is nothing new. Why are you so angry?"</p><p>The other elder intervened and said with a smile to Qin Sang and the others, "Go stand on the teleportation formation. Remember to keep your mouths shut after returning, and don't cause any trouble."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the teleportation formation.  A flash of white light later, he hurriedly crushed the teleportation talisman. After a dizzying sensation, he appeared in front of a familiar teleportation hall.</p><p>"Finally back!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought silently, then noticed a Nascent Soul cultivator guarding this hall as well.  Startled, he quickly bowed.</p><p>The cultivator ignored them.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly and followed the guards out of the hall.</p><p>The scenery in Tianxing City remained the same, but the atmosphere was distinctly different. Cultivators hurried along, their brows furrowed with worry.</p><p>Qin Sang walked without stopping, heading straight back to his cave dwelling.</p><p>He secretly hoped that during his absence, his external avatar had reached a critical stage, just one step away from completion.</p><p>The restrictions on his cave dwelling were intact. Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, pushed the door open, and found several message talismans floating in the courtyard.</p>
