<h1>Chapter 2140: Supreme Beyond</h1><p>The Great Ascension realm is not something ordinary people can fathom.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh, "Forgive my boldness, but dare I ask who Venerable Ning's master is?"</p><p>Venerable Ning should be a member of the Daoist lineage, knowing so many secrets, her background must be significant.  The renowned sects of the Elixir Refinement lineage are all recorded in the Dao Court's scriptures. He wondered which sect Venerable Ning belonged to.</p><p>"Has Emissary Qin ever heard of the Supreme Beyond Dao Sect?" Venerable Ning asked in return.</p><p>It was the Supreme Beyond Dao Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished. He had seen it in the Dao Court scriptures. The Supreme Beyond Dao Sect belonged to the Elixir Refinement lineage and was known as the foremost Dao Sect in ancient times!</p><p>After ascending to the Greater Thousand World, Qin Sang discovered that the Supreme Beyond Dao Sect's reputation was not prominent and was now little known. He had thought that the Supreme Beyond Dao Sect, like the Dao Court, had also suffered misfortune, either declining or retreating from the world.</p><p>"Heaven and Earth undergo creation, existence, destruction, and emptiness; people experience birth, aging, sickness, and death; sects also have their rise and fall, with tribulations omnipresent. Everything is like this."</p><p>Venerable Ning sighed, "This humble Daoist merely possesses a lineage inheritance from the Supreme Beyond Dao Sect."</p><p>Listening to Venerable Ning's tone, could it be that the Supreme Beyond Dao Sect had already splintered?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. The Divine Court had collapsed, the Dao Court had been forced to sever itself from a realm, the Purple Firmament Palace's fourteen Sword Pavilions were mostly destroyed and fell into the Lesser Thousand World, and even the Supreme Beyond Dao Sect had declined.</p><p>These peak powers, possessing countless strong individuals, all met such ends. Only the Great Zhou Dynasty continued to this day, but it was only the nominal ruler of the world. Just what had happened in ancient times?</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt something, withdrawing his stray thoughts. Immediately, footsteps came from outside the pavilion. Two nuns emerged from the forest and stood beside Liao Chen, bowing to Venerable Ning, then quietly waiting outside the pavilion.</p><p>The two nuns, one old and one young, were not Liu Li. They met Qin Sang's gaze and nodded politely, but their eyes carried a hint of indifference.</p><p>Still not seeing Liu Li appear, Qin Sang felt it was increasingly unusual.</p><p>"It seems Venerable Ning prefers to prioritize cultivation, for both to reach the Great Ascension realm, attain immortality together, and remain together forever? What does this have to do with this humble Daoist?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Emissary Qin and Liu Li are deeply connected.  You likely underestimate the lingering effects of the evil technique and its influence on Liu Li. After forming karmic ties with Emissary Qin, Liu Li has been constantly trying to save herself. The initial influence wasn't so profound; Liu Li still had hope of breaking free.  But fate is cruel. Every time she was close to succeeding, various reasons would cause her efforts to fail. Once the resolution failed, after extreme suppression, the resurgence would only exacerbate the lingering effects, causing Liu Li to sink deeper!" A flicker of pity flashed in Venerable Ning's eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied Venerable Ning's words. Although he couldn't fully empathize, he had witnessed Liu Li's struggle.  Back then, he proposed a possibility for resolving the hidden danger, expressed his feelings, and immediately left, precisely to avoid pressuring Liu Li.</p><p>"Even so, Liu Li has found her true heart, which shows she possesses an extraordinarily strong will. Back then, she was already prepared to agree to your..."</p><p>Venerable Ning looked deeply at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He had already learned of this from Shi Xue and Abbess Yun Xin. If not for that accident, if the Storm Realm were a normal Lesser Thousand World, perhaps he and Liu Li would have ascended together, journeying together in the Greater Thousand World.</p><p>"If you two were willing to open your hearts to each other, it wouldn't be a bad solution. Or if Emissary Qin was willing to fully assist, with Liu Li's character, this humble Daoist could also devise a way to help you two摆脱 the lingering effects of the evil technique.  Unfortunately..."</p><p>Venerable Ning sighed softly, "Fate is cruel. Emissary Qin has arrived a step too late!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed dramatically.  "What does Venerable Ning mean by that?"</p><p>"A hundred years ago, learning of the Purple Firmament Palace's emergence in Feng Ju Jade Gate, Liao Chen and the others took Liu Li to Feng Ju Jade Gate to search for her master Bing Yao's whereabouts," Venerable Ning said.</p><p>"Liu Li went to Feng Ju Jade Gate?  So, she already knows about Bing Yao..."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside the pavilion.</p><p>Calculating the time, he had also entered Feng Ju Jade Gate around that time, yet they missed each other.</p><p>Liao Chen nodded slightly. "We found the Heavenly Mountain fragment within the Purple Firmament Palace. It was already in ruins, having suffered a terrible impact during the realm's shattering. Bing Yao was trapped within the mountain, and it's likely more misfortune than fortune. We searched near Feng Ju Jade Gate for a while, and indeed didn't find any trace of Bing Yao.  Later, we encountered an incident and had to leave."</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the incident Liao Chen referred to was the emergence of the Purple Firmament Palace and the great battle triggered by the gathering of powerful cultivators.</p><p>"Looking at Liu Li's cultivation journey, it can't be separated from the word 'love'! Familial love, gratitude, and even romantic love, although this love stemmed from an ill-fated relationship," Venerable Ning commented.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>Back then, at Shao Hua Mountain, Liu Li risked everything to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, not for herself, nor with the same aspiration for the Immortal Dao as him, but solely to rescue her master and repay her kindness. It was also because of this that she became entangled with him.</p><p>Venerable Ning was right. Liu Li's life was defined by the word 'love'.</p><p>"Emissary Qin should be able to imagine, when she made up her mind, opened her heart, only to be met with the devastating news of Emissary Qin's demise, how cruel it was, especially with the lingering effects of the evil technique still present, how great the impact was on her! Not succumbing to Qi Deviation was already due to her enduring hardships and possessing sufficiently strong willpower. Since then, although she helped Emissary Qin's sect and descendants, finding solace in it, Bing Yao had already become her last hope..."</p><p>Venerable Ning paused.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent, understanding Venerable Ning's meaning.</p><p>Rescuing her master was her greatest obsession and the spiritual pillar of her cultivation.  Now that this obsession had been shattered, putting himself in her shoes, he might have already become disheartened.</p><p>"Liu Li... is she alright now?"  Qin Sang's voice was a little hoarse.</p><p>"In fact, the lingering effects of this evil technique are not entirely without a method of resolution. This humble Daoist possesses a cultivation method."</p><p>Venerable Ning jumped to another topic, but Qin Sang had already adapted, patiently listening to her continue.</p><p>"This method cultivates the Supreme Forgetting Emotion Dao!"</p><p>Venerable Ning's words made Qin Sang's pupils constrict.</p><p>"Supreme Forgetting Emotion, those beneath it cannot grasp emotion; that which emotion fixates on is precisely our kind!  Liu Li successively experienced Silver Needle Locking Emotion, Ice Soul Sealing Emotion, and Wisdom Sword Severing Emotion. Each failure was a violent eruption, each comparable to a love tribulation. Few people in the world have experienced such trials and tribulations as her, and whose emotions are so intense.  Although it's not unrelated to that evil technique, she was not only able to resist its influence but also find her true heart, which is extremely rare. Among those this humble Daoist has met, no one is more suited to cultivate the Supreme Forgetting Emotion Dao than Liu Li."</p><p>Venerable Ning's tone shifted.  "However, Liu Li previously refused me."</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved. "And now..."</p><p>"After returning from Feng Ju Jade Gate, she agreed."</p><p>Venerable Ning sighed again, "Fate is cruel.  No one expected that Emissary Qin would return alive, but he arrived a step too late."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, turning to look at the lake.</p><p>There was no wind at the moment, and a faint mist rose from the water's surface, gathering into a thin fog that settled on the lake.</p><p>As if sensing the oppressive atmosphere, the fish at the bottom of the lake surfaced to breathe fresh air, creating ripples on the water's surface.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang thought of something, his face darkening. He abruptly looked outside the pavilion, staring intently at Liao Chen.</p><p>"When you went to Feng Ju Jade Gate, this humble Daoist should have been nearby. Cultivators ascending from the Storm Realm would certainly know about the Purple Firmament Palace. Once the news spread, they might be drawn to Feng Ju Jade Gate.  This humble Daoist specifically left his true name at the Five Elements Alliance branch in Jade Gate Pass. Didn't the Venerable Monk hear of it?"</p><p>A Five Elements Alliance elder wasn't a minor figure in Jade Gate Pass.  As long as one made inquiries, they would certainly be able to find out.</p><p>If Liu Li knew he was still alive, and they reunited at Feng Ju Jade Gate, how could there have been these subsequent events?</p><p>Liao Chen pressed his palms together and chanted a Buddhist mantra. "We truly didn't know that Emissary Qin was also at Feng Ju Jade Gate. When we arrived, powerful cultivators were already battling at Feng Ju Jade Gate. Jade Gate Pass was repeatedly affected, and various factions had basically withdrawn from the pass. Later, Jade Gate Pass became a ruin, and people scattered in all directions."</p><p>The old nun couldn't help but interject, "Although we and Liu Li are not from the same sect, we have all received Venerable Ning's personal guidance and have always regarded her as a junior sister.  If Liu Li could reunite with Emissary Qin, we would be overjoyed for her. How could we obstruct it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless.  He couldn't blame them. He couldn't simply suspect them of deliberately concealing the news from Liu Li.</p><p>The turmoil caused by the emergence of the Purple Firmament Palace was too great. Jade Gate Pass and Feng Ju Jade Gate had become chaotic. Liao Chen's explanation was very plausible.</p><p>The young nun lowered her head and said softly, "Emissary Qin, please don't think we're being cold.  Junior Sister has had a difficult life, and we all feel great pity for her. It's just that Emissary Qin's timing is not right. Junior Sister has already begun cultivating Supreme Forgetting Emotion. If it's forcibly interrupted now, it might lead to her utter ruin."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Venerable Ning.</p><p>Venerable Ning nodded slightly.  "No matter how strong Liu Li's willpower, it ultimately has limits.  Now, if she gives up Supreme Forgetting Emotion again, the consequences will only be more severe than before. Even if you become Dao Companions, I'm afraid she will continue to be tormented by the lingering effects of the evil technique. Only by obtaining the true 'Vermilion Bird Heart Sutra' might there be hope of resolution. However, let's not mention that this humble Daoist doesn't know which sect possesses the 'Vermilion Bird Heart Sutra', even if it could be obtained immediately, would Emissary Qin be willing to cultivate it?"</p><p>Venerable Ning gazed into Qin Sang's eyes, her gaze seemingly able to penetrate his eyes and see through his heart.</p><p>After a moment, Venerable Ning said meaningfully, "Although the Dai Yu Immortal Mountain is severely damaged, it still has its merits, which require Emissary Qin to discover for himself. Moreover, the Immortal Mountain is not beyond restoration.  This humble Daoist can inform Emissary Qin how to repair and utilize the Immortal Mountain, which will certainly benefit Emissary Qin immensely!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "What exactly is Venerable Ning trying to say?"</p><p>Venerable Ning continued on her own, "Once the Dai Yu Immortal Mountain is restored to a certain extent, Emissary Qin can refine it. After stepping into the Body Integration realm, you can have the Immortal Mountain reside within your own Dharma Domain.  The power of the Immortal Mountain can make the Dharma Domain even more stable and powerful. You must know how difficult it is to enhance one's Dharma Domain. With the Immortal Mountain's aid, Emissary Qin can effortlessly surpass your peers. If you can restore the Dai Yu Immortal Mountain to its former glory, it might even be helpful for breaking through to the Great Ascension realm in the future. Is this not enough to tempt Emissary Qin?"</p><p>When she said these words, Venerable Ning's tone was full of enticement, and an invisible pressure enveloped the lake pavilion and its surroundings.</p><p>Liao Chen and the two nuns revealed expressions of tension, simultaneously taking a few steps back.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained unmoved.  He slammed the table and stood up, abruptly breaking free from the pressure, and said coldly, "The Dai Yu Immortal Mountain is at Qing Yang Temple.  Please take it back, Venerable Ning!"</p><p>Venerable Ning stared at Qin Sang for a long time, then suddenly smiled faintly. The surrounding pressure instantly vanished, her tone a mixture of joy and a sigh, "Liu Li's luck isn't so bad after all. At least she didn't choose the wrong person."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback, slowly sitting down. Unable to grasp this Venerable Ning's intentions, he simply waited and watched.</p><p>"Supreme Forgetting Emotion, attaining emotion and then forgetting emotion, reaching a state of detachment from emotion. I believe Liu Li will eventually reach this realm, but she has only just begun cultivating this method and cannot achieve it yet.  The first step of cultivation is to 'forget', to forget the most profound emotions of the past, to purify oneself, and return to one's true nature.  What she chose to forget first was not the master-disciple bond with Bing Yao, but..."</p><p>Venerable Ning paused, uttering a single word, "You."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat puzzled.  What exactly did Liu Li forget? Was it the点点滴滴 they experienced together? Or Liu Li's own emotional changes? Or perhaps, in Liu Li's memory, he no longer existed at all?</p><p>"If I were to meet Liu Li now..."</p><p>Venerable Ning thought for a moment, "Perhaps, a familiar stranger."</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless.</p><p>"Upon reaching the Great Ascension realm, will Liu Li be able to achieve the state Venerable Ning mentioned?"</p><p>Qin Sang understood the intent behind Venerable Ning's earlier question.</p><p>Venerable Ning replied frankly.</p><p>"Out of selfish desire, having finally found a descendant capable of inheriting the Supreme Emotionless Dao lineage, this humble Daoist should have done everything to prevent Emissary Qin from influencing Liu Li, but I am Liu Li's master!</p><p>"I cannot give Emissary Qin a definitive answer. No one knows whether, after Liu Li transcends worldly emotions, she will resolutely choose to enter the world or remain unmoved, detached from the world.</p><p>"I can only tell Emissary Qin that accepting the situation, for both you and Liu Li, is the cruelest and also the most rational choice, possibly the only choice."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent again.</p><p>Outside the lake pavilion, the monk and two nuns also silently looked at Qin Sang, their expressions complex.  Previously, they didn't want Qin Sang to come; now, they felt sorry for them.</p><p>"Is Venerable Ning asking me to stay away from Liu Li?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Liao Chen and the others outside the pavilion, then at the landscape of Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>With its jagged rocks and dense forests, Liu Li might be cultivating somewhere in the mountains, so close, yet unable to meet.</p><p>Did Venerable Ning specifically bring him here to make him give up?</p><p>"Emissary Qin misunderstands. It's better to guide than to suppress. This humble Daoist's purpose is not to stop Emissary Qin but to explain the advantages and disadvantages. We both sincerely care for Liu Li, and we should unite.  In this process, she will also be subtly influenced by you. If you both reach the Great Ascension realm in the future and become Dao Companions, this humble Daoist would be happy to see it.  As the saying goes..."</p><p>Venerable Ning stood up, walked to the edge of the lake pavilion, placed her hand on a stone pillar, and looked towards the vast expanse of blue water beyond the mountains, her voice trailing off.</p><p>"Forgetting emotion is not being emotionless; having emotion, why must one sever emotion!"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Hei Ma Lou only has free time tomorrow, so I have to take leave now. Tomorrow, I'll face destiny!</p><p>The operations officer proposed holding a side story activity in the book discussion group, and in the end, three copies of Black Myth Wukong will be given away.  I also express my apologies (laughs)~</p><p>Interested book friends can start brainstorming now.  Specific details will be released in the next few days.</p><p>Rest assured, the activity will be fully arranged by the operations officer and will not affect the author's writing.</p>
