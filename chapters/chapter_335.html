Chapter 328 Unsold


The mysterious Golden Core cultivator paused, then continued in a beguiling tone, “The Violet Citadel is the most enigmatic celestial abode in the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, a sacred ground not to be missed even by Nascent Soul elders.  Countless Core Formation cultivators have schemed tirelessly to obtain a Violet Citadel Key, which speaks volumes about the value of the treasures within.  For those of you interested in exploring the Violet Citadel, now is your best chance. Miss this Key of mine, and finding another won't be so easy. Remember, you haven't yet reached Core Formation. Even if you hail from prominent sects, your Nascent Soul ancestors can't guarantee your safe passage into the Violet Citadel. You must possess a Key to ensure your safety. The last time the Violet Citadel appeared, I was but a lowly Qi Refinement cultivator. I still vividly recall the upheaval caused by the Citadel Keys!”


The Golden Core cultivator's voice was filled with nostalgia and emotion as he spoke.
The hall fell silent.
No one doubted the cultivator's words. After all, this was an auction organized by the Gloom Ridge, held openly in public.  The Gloom Ridge wouldn't risk its reputation by colluding with a Core Formation cultivator to spread lies.
The key point was the implied value of the item, based solely on the cultivator's description. What price did he intend to ask?
And was it truly worth paying a hefty price for what amounted to an entrance ticket, in the hopes of finding even greater treasures inside?  It couldn't be that simple.
If the Violet Citadel was truly a treasure trove, why would this cultivator auction off a Key?
Qin Sang, however, was thinking about his own 'sheepskin'. If it was also a Violet Citadel Key, it would explain why his previous attempts to activate it had failed.
As the cultivator had said, the Citadel Keys would only respond with the emergence of the spiritual tide and the imminent opening of the Violet Citadel, followed by a struggle for entry.
He hadn't realized the 'sheepskin' held such a secret.  He had left it in a corner of his storage pouch and hadn't examined it since arriving at the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.
Whispers rippled through the hall.
The Daoist priest who had acquired the Goldwater Formation cautiously inquired, "As far as this junior knows, only Nascent Soul elders and Core Formation seniors have explored the Violet Citadel in the past.  Even so, many have perished within. It must be a perilous place.  Even if we Foundation Establishment cultivators could enter, we'd likely face certain death.  Who would dare covet the treasures within?"


The Daoist priest's words voiced the doubts of many.
The Violet Citadel was clearly an extremely dangerous place.  Even Nascent Soul and Core Formation cultivators weren't guaranteed safety. Foundation Establishment cultivators would be walking into a death trap.
Enthusiasm waned.
The Golden Core cultivator, however, remained patient and chuckled.
"Indeed, few Foundation Establishment cultivators have entered the Violet Citadel, but there have been some. Having reached this stage of cultivation, you must understand the principle of 'fortune favors the bold'. Do you expect smooth sailing and rapid cultivation without risk? Within the Violet Citadel lie treasures capable of defying fate and transforming one's destiny. Thousands of years ago, a False Core cultivator emerged from the Citadel and achieved Nascent Soul within a century.  Furthermore, the elixirs and secret techniques you seek to break through your bottlenecks, those you can't find even by searching high and low, can only be found within the Violet Citadel.  Whether you choose a life of mediocrity or a desperate gamble is for you to decide."
Silence descended upon the hall as the crowd contemplated his words.
The Golden Core cultivator said no more.  Gao Yi, having received his instructions, announced loudly, "One Violet Citadel Key! The senior has set a base price: one magical treasure, even a damaged one, of any type!"
Gasps echoed through the hall. They had anticipated a high price, but no one expected it to be a magical treasure!
Several individuals, initially tempted by the cultivator's words, were immediately deterred.
Not every Core Formation cultivator possessed a magical treasure, especially those who had recently broken through. Most were still striving to create their first nascent treasure.
Let alone Foundation Establishment cultivators.
Furthermore, a tangible magical treasure held more weight than the ethereal promise of opportunity.  Even a damaged treasure was easier to repair than to forge anew.  Upon reaching Core Formation, acquiring a treasure would be swift. This temptation outweighed the allure of the Violet Citadel.
Only those with no hope of advancement would gamble everything on such an exchange.
Qin Sang relaxed against his chair. He possessed the Ten Yama Banners and the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings, two magical treasures, but both were illicit and he had no intention of trading them.
Even if his 'sheepskin' was a genuine Violet Citadel Key, he would wait until he returned to his sect and thoroughly investigated the Citadel before making a decision.  The Golden Core cultivator's words were vague and misleading.  The Violet Citadel was undoubtedly more complex than he let on.
If the potential rewards didn't justify the risks, there was no need to risk his life.
If a Violet Citadel Key was truly worth a magical treasure…
Qin Sang stroked his chin, lost in thought, no longer paying attention to the auction. The Key would likely remain unsold. He wondered if there would be any fools.
As Qin Sang predicted, after Gao Yi hawked the Key for a while, no bids were placed, and he finally declared it unsold.
"It seems I'll have to stay at the Gloom Ridge for a few more days," the Golden Core cultivator said with a smile as he retrieved the Key, showing no disappointment.
Qin Sang suddenly understood. The cultivator likely hadn't expected to sell the Key. Instead, he used the auction to spread news of the Key, attracting those with the means to acquire it.
His true target was the upcoming Core Formation cultivator auction!
Of course, if someone had bought it, trading a Key for a magical treasure would have been a profit for him.
A cunning old fox.
Qin Sang cursed inwardly. Hearing Gao Yi announce the end of the auction, he immediately rose from his seat, merged with the crowd, and headed for the shadowed passage.
Along the way, Qin Sang was bombarded with offers. Many cultivators transmitted their desire to purchase his Soul-Attracting Grass at a generous price, but Qin Sang refused them all.
Entering the shadows, Qin Sang quickly changed into new robes and a mask, altering his appearance drastically. He meticulously checked for any tracking marks before stepping back out.
Emerging from the shadows, Qin Sang observed that most others had done the same, rendering themselves unrecognizable.
Some chose to leave Stone Island immediately, while the majority planned to stay a few more days.
The crowd dispersed into the streets. Qin Sang walked inconspicuously, detecting no followers. He then found another opportunity to change his attire once more.
