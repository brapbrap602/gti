<h1>## CHAPTER 212: THE HORRIBLE CARNAGE</h1><p>Together, the duo quickly dispatches the humanoid cloud beast. Qin Sang retrieves his Ebonywood Sword, and asks in return: "Will Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong be willing to leave?"</p><p>To exit the Grand Chasm, they need the combined efforts of everyone operating the astrolabe. If Recluse Yun Qiong is unwilling to leave, he too cannot depart.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin has guessed correctly…"</p><p>Mu Yifeng expresses with helplessness: "Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong said that, no matter what, he must go in and search, refusing to abandon Yin Xingge like this; otherwise, when he returns to Xuanlu Pass, he'll have no way to explain himself. However, he'd like to request Junior Brother Qin's opinion."</p><p>Qin Sang gazes impassively at Mu Yifeng, inwardly deducing that this is likely not solely Recluse Yun Qiong's wish, and that the two of them might have reached an understanding.</p><p>Mu Yifeng keeps his eyes fixed on the Sun Yang Crystal.</p><p>Recluse Yun Qiong might genuinely intend to save someone, but Mu Yifeng's aim is likely not to rescue Yin Xingge; on the contrary, he'd rather see Yin Xingge's corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang does not immediately promise or refuse, but instead shifts the topic: "The humanoid cloud beasts Senior Brother Mu saw, were they also cloud beast spirits that have possessed the corpses of Demonic Sect cultivators, and evolved?"</p><p>"That's right!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng nods: "Junior Brother Qin, you have no need to find this strange; the situation in Little Cold Domain is highly unpredictable. Over the years, the Seven Heroes Pass has changed hands several times. When the Demonic Sect was powerful, Xuanlu Pass fell into their hands more than once. Junior Brother Qin can see from the enormous space outside that this place was originally the mine of Sun Yang Quartz, excavated by human hands. Later, when the Sun Yang Quartz was nearly completely mined, it was no longer worth expending resources and was thus abandoned. Back when the Demonic Sect cultivators held Xuanlu Pass, there's no way they would have neglected this treasure trove, so the presence of Demonic Sect cultivators is normal."</p><p>As they speak, Recluse Yun Qiong and the others catch up to them, urging with anxiety: "The power of the astrolabe has begun to show signs of instability; it won't last much longer. We must find Senior Brother Yin as soon as possible."</p><p>Mu Yifeng says to Qin Sang: "Junior Brother Qin, let's pour the eight of our all into activating the astrolabe, constraining the astrolabe's power within a small area around us. As long as we are careful enough, we should be able to deceive low level cloud beasts comparable to Gold Core stage for a short while. Going in to take a look shouldn't pose much of a problem. Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong is also a man of reason, he won't persist in going against what is clearly unfeasible. Moreover, including this one, Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong and I have already killed four; they were all around the same level of strength. It's unlikely that there are very powerful humanoid cloud beasts within. It's more likely that there are simply too many of them, and Senior Brother Yin has been trapped by them…"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitates momentarily, then nods in agreement.</p><p>This is not because he has been convinced by Mu Yifeng; he also has some ulterior motives. Firstly, he has his Corpse of Evil in secret at the head, scouting the way. Once they encounter danger, it will be the first to notice. The Corpse of Evil is not an animated corpse, so long as he can find the corpse of a Foundation Building stage cultivator, he can refine it. On the Ancient Immortal battlefield, the corpses of cultivators are not hard to come by, so even if he really does end up destroying one, it won't be too painful.</p><p>Secondly, he wants to see if he can collect more Soul Refining type magical artifacts to enhance the power of his Asura Banner as soon as possible.</p><p>Having decided upon this, everyone immediately springs into action. Qin Sang activates the astrolabe while simultaneously controlling the Corpse of Evil, having it stealthily proceed ahead.</p><p>The Corpse of Evil exudes no presence of life, and hides amidst the Demonic Qi. As long as it doesn't actively attack, the cloud beasts won't bother with it. They swiftly dash into the depths of the passageway, consecutively encountering three humanoid cloud beasts along the way. None of them are particularly powerful, and the trio of Qin Sang, Mu Yifeng, and Yun Qiong join forces, annihilating them in a swift and deadly manner.</p><p>To Qin Sang's disappointment, only one humanoid cloud beast possesses a magical artifact, and it's moreover not a Soul Refining type.</p><p>The deeper they go, the more humanoid cloud beasts they encounter. Qin Sang and company no longer dare to recklessly make a move, choosing as far as possible to avoid the humanoid cloud beasts, and advancing in silence.</p><p>"It's right in front…"</p><p>At this time, they are about to reach the location indicated by the jade talisman when a burst of commotion abruptly erupts from the passage ahead, as though someone is engaged in fierce combat.</p><p>"Senior Brother Yin is still alive!" Recluse Yun Qiong exclaims joyfully.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng exchange a glance, yet their expressions are unusually grim. Drifting into their ears are only the eerie howls of cloud beasts; not once have they heard Yin Xingge produce any sounds.</p><p>Yin Xingge's Cloud Thunder Net can manipulate the power of thunder. If fully activated, there will definitely be an unstoppable rumbling of thunder. Yet, right now, they can't hear any thunder at all.</p><p>Recluse Yun Qiong is no fool; seeing the expressions of Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng, he also quickly grasps the situation, growing more and more solemn.</p><p>"I'll go take a look!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng can no longer contain himself, and is about to stealthily slink over when Qin Sang abruptly grabs hold of him.</p><p>"We don't know what the situation is inside. Senior Brother Mu, please don't be rash, and first use Illusionary Sound to investigate…"</p><p>Qin Sang conjures spiritual energy, and kneads it into a small spell incantation. Mu Yifeng can only patiently wait until Qin Sang finishes his technique.</p><p>At the intersection of several passages, Qin Sang cast a magic spell into one passage, and a moment later, Qin Sang's voice was heard from within.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yin?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yin?"</p><p>...</p><p>The voice was not loud, but the cloud beasts in front were all startled and there was a sudden commotion as they rushed out of the passage one after another.</p><p>Everyone urged their cloud disks with all their might and hid in another passage. They saw the humanoid cloud beasts swarming in the direction of the sound. When they saw what these humanoid cloud beasts looked like, everyone's expressions changed and they gasped!</p><p>...</p><p>Pulling Mu Yifeng, Qin Sang cast an imitation spell while manipulating the evil corpse with his mind, trying his best to avoid the cloud beasts and quietly sneaked in.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but be secretly shocked after perceiving the horrific scene inside through the evil corpse.</p><p>Flesh and blood flew everywhere, and broken bones were scattered all over the ground.</p><p>The humanoid cloud beasts were covered in blood on their hands and mouths. They were争抢 to gnaw on pieces of tender flesh. It was obvious who these pieces of flesh belonged to.</p><p>Yin Xingge had been completely torn to pieces, with both flesh and bones, and it was impossible to tell which part belonged to what.</p><p>And the strength of these humanoid cloud beasts was not particularly terrifying. Could it be that someone else had killed Yin Xingge?</p><p>The evil corpse quietly walked into the depths of the passage and found a bottomless crevice dug inside. A steady stream of demonic energy emerged from it, accompanied by strange roars, as if a terrifying demon was hiding in the depths of the crevice.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang dared not expose the evil corpse even more. Just as he was about to quietly return, he actually found a spirit beast pouch beside the crevice. While these humanoid cloud beasts were crazily fighting over the flesh and blood, the spirit beast pouch was lying in a corner and no one paid any attention to it.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat and he controlled the evil corpse to pick up the spirit beast pouch. He then asked the evil corpse to search carefully around the crevice.</p><p>...</p><p>The humanoid cloud beasts were all covered in scarlet blood.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the people hiding under the astral disk changed their expressions one after another. Although they hadn't seen Yin Xingge's body, everyone knew in their hearts that Yin Xingge was probably doomed.</p><p>"We need to find him alive, or find his body!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng looked around at the crowd and said in a deep voice, "You wait here. I'll sneak in and take a look."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly thought, "As expected." Mu Yifeng still had the Qianyang Crystal in mind, so he said, "Senior Brother Mu, I'll go with you. I'll be there to support you."</p>
