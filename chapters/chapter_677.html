Chapter 669: Setting Off


Qin Sang filled all his Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottles with Earthly Yin Qi, preparing for any unforeseen circumstances. Then, he retrieved the Blackwater Mirror.


From the soul search, Qin Sang now understood this magical treasure. He couldn't help but feel fortunate that he hadn't let Du Han unleash its full power, or capturing him alive wouldn't have been so easy.


The Blackwater Mirror was versatile, capable of both offense and defense.


Especially defensively, the unique spiritual water sealed within could transform into shields or barriers, adeptly neutralizing attacks with a gentle force.


Moreover, its power increased by ten percent when used in aquatic environments, making it a truly exceptional treasure, particularly suited for the Storm Demon Sea.


Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. Seeing that he still had ample time, he decided to subdue the Blackwater Mirror right there.


The journey to the Storm Demon Sea would be long and arduous, fraught with unknown dangers. Naturally, he needed to enhance his strength as much as possible.


"The Li Wu Palace must have noticed Du Han's death by now, right? By the time they send someone to the Western Frontier to investigate, I'll be long gone from the Wu God Continent."


Qin Sang sneered inwardly, erasing Du Han's residual aura from the treasure and focusing on refining it.


Three days later, a figure appeared above the canyon, shimmering briefly before soaring northwards.


By then, the Blackwater Mirror resided within Qin Sang's dantian.


He familiarized himself with the treasure while nurturing it with his Golden Core, repairing the spiritual damage caused by the Blood Defilement Divine Light.


Unburdened by Du Han, Qin Sang's speed increased significantly. He returned to Pingbo Harbor in just seven days. Within the city, he contacted several trading companies, gathering information about the Boundless Sea and the Storm Demon Sea.  On the appointed day, Qin Sang arrived at Pingbo Harbor's east gate, their agreed meeting point.


As soon as he stepped out of the city gate, he heard Ran Luo's relieved voice, "Daoist Qing Feng, you're finally here! The caravan is about to depart. I haven't seen you and was worried you were held up by important matters and might miss the appointed time."


A figure emerged from the distance ahead – it was Ran Luo, looking at him with a hint of reproach.


Evidently, Qin Sang's demonstrated skill in artifact refinement was highly valued by the Qiongyu Trading Company; otherwise, Ran Luo wouldn't be so enthusiastic.


"My apologies for making you wait, Fellow Daoist Ran. I returned to the city earlier but didn't want to disturb your company, so I waited until now."


Qin Sang cupped his hands in greeting and looked past Ran Luo, startled by the sheer size of the caravan. He had underestimated the scale of even a large trading company.


Rows of large carts stretched out, pulled by domesticated low-level demonic beasts.


Those were secondary. Within the caravan, Qin Sang sensed over a hundred auras, some powerful, some concealed. Each individual's cultivation was no weaker than his own, and some were clearly masking their true strength.


"A trading company with so many Golden Core experts?"


Qin Sang was inwardly shocked. "Perhaps there's even a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor among them."


Seeing Qin Sang scrutinizing the caravan, Ran Luo smiled knowingly. "Daoist, you misunderstand. Our Qiongyu Trading Company doesn't possess such profound resources. Thanks to the trust of other trading companies and fellow Daoists, many contacted us to join the expedition as soon as we announced it a month ago.  Add to that the numerous solitary cultivators, and we have this large a group.  Such a scale is rare, even in the past."


So that's how it is, Qin Sang thought.  With so many people from different backgrounds, he no longer worried about the Qiongyu Trading Company harboring ulterior motives.


However, such a large group traveling openly through Wu territory presented other concerns.


"Fellow Daoist Ran, have you noticed anything unusual about the major Wu sects recently? It seems to involve Nascent Soul cultivators. I'm worried something might happen.  Isn't such a large and conspicuous group too risky…?"


Qin Sang carefully chose his words, transmitting his question to Ran Luo.


He believed that with the Dongji Alliance's power, they must have detected some signs.


Ran Luo's expression stiffened.  She looked Qin Sang up and down, then glanced around, gesturing for him to follow her to a corner behind the caravan. With a meaningful look, she said, "I didn't expect Daoist's information network to be so extensive, even privy to the Wu's secrets.  I only learned some inside information from Elder Zou recently."


"Winds rise from the smallest ripples. Such a large movement by the Wu is bound to leave some traces. I'm simply observant," Qin Sang replied vaguely, not revealing his source.


Ran Luo scrutinized Qin Sang, her respect for him growing. After a moment of contemplation, she transmitted her reply.


"Daoist, you may not know, but our Qiongyu Trading Company originally planned to depart for the Storm Demon Sea six months from now. It's precisely because we noticed something unusual about the Wu that we decided to leave now.


"If chaos erupts and we're trapped in Pingbo Harbor, isolated and without support, our own people will surely abandon us. Several other large trading companies have also sensed something amiss and privately agreed to travel together.


"To expedite our departure, we're only carrying a portion of our lighter goods, and all our personnel are at least Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Traveling light allows for greater speed.


"Elder Zou's recent visits to the Earth Gate and other locations were actually to gather intelligence.  For now, the Wu sects remain calm, so there's no need to worry. As long as we don't delay, we'll certainly escape.  And if we detect anything amiss, we have a plan to slip away unnoticed. Just follow me, Daoist."


The major trading companies were this pessimistic? They were already preparing to withdraw from the Wu God Continent?  Qin Sang's heart sank.  The situation seemed even more serious than he had imagined.


Seeing that the Qiongyu Trading Company had made thorough preparations, Qin Sang could only choose to go with them.


After all, if chaos erupted, escaping by ship from Pingbo Harbor wouldn't be feasible. He would be directly caught in the front lines of the battle. Heading directly towards Mount Wu God might actually be faster.


Having addressed Qin Sang's concerns, Ran Luo led him towards a carriage.


Qin Sang was to share the carriage with Ran Luo.  Besides them, there were two others in the carriage, both Golden Core cultivators.


Four people in one carriage was a bit cramped and uncomfortable, but it was something he had to endure.


"Elder Zou is in the carriage ahead. Would you like to meet him, Daoist?" Ran Luo asked.


Qin Sang considered it, then shook his head. "Perhaps not.  Elder Zou is busy managing the caravan. I won't disturb him for now. I can pay my respects when we reach the Storm Demon Sea."


Ran Luo didn't press the matter.  After settling Qin Sang in, she flew to the front of the caravan to attend to other matters. The lead carts were already moving.


Qin Sang stepped onto the carriage, taking one last look back at Pingbo Harbor.


Most of the human cultivators on the Wu God Continent were gathered in this city.


The Qiongyu Trading Company only took a few key personnel with them, abandoning those with lower cultivation levels.


If chaos erupted, Qin Sang couldn't imagine their fate.


He shook his head.  He could barely protect himself, let alone others. He could only hope that the Wu Nascent Soul cultivators would remain calm and allow the hard-won peace to continue.
