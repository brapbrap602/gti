<h1>Chapter 317: Captured Alive</h1><p>“Die!”</p><p>The scarred man glared fiercely at Qin Sang. Qin Sang was too fast; escape was impossible.  Focusing solely on fleeing would only hasten his death.</p><p>The scarred man understood this all too well.</p><p>He resolved to fight to the death!</p><p>His flying sword erupted with sword Qi, emitting a deafening shriek as it shot towards Qin Sang like a rainbow.</p><p>Facing the incredibly sharp sword Qi, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. He had anticipated this when he decided to lure the scarred man into pursuit.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword was his trump card.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword suddenly unleashed its own sword Qi, forming the Thousand Transformations Sword Formation. It instantly suppressed the two flying swords of Yu Daiyue and his companion, then tore through the void, darting back like a fish through water.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A crisp clang echoed as the Ebony Wood Sword narrowly intercepted the incoming sword light.</p><p>Throughout this, Qin Sang didn't pause.</p><p>Seeing his flying sword blocked and Qin Sang closing in, the scarred man panicked.  With Qin Sang's speed, he had no time to deploy another magical tool. He could only hurriedly throw out several talismans, attempting to force Qin Sang back.</p><p>In an instant, talismans filled the air. Fire, metal swords, thorny vines – all kinds of spells flew, creating a dazzling display.</p><p>Unfortunately, these talismans were far weaker than the previous Thunder Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and, with a surge of spiritual power, withstood the force of the talismans. He raised his hand, and a cloud of black poisonous miasma flew out. At such close range, it easily enveloped the scarred man.</p><p>Poisoned by the Heavenly Poison Gauze, the scarred man's mind became hazy. He shuddered violently, and upon regaining some clarity, he realized his spiritual power was stagnating, filling him with terror.</p><p>At the same time, the scarred man's flying sword faltered. Qin Sang seized the opportunity, manipulating the Ebony Wood Sword to knock the flying sword away and then rushed into the poisonous miasma.</p><p>The scarred man felt a chill in his chest. Looking down, he saw a large bloody hole in his heart, blood gushing out.</p><p>His eyes were fixed in disbelief, his death filled with resentment.</p><p>From the moment Qin Sang turned to the moment he killed the scarred man, only a blink of an eye had passed. Yu Daiyue and his companion had just regained their footing, preparing to join the attack on Qin Sang, when they witnessed the horrifying scene – the scarred man's body falling from the poisonous miasma.</p><p>The crimson blood was like a knife, stabbing into their eyes.</p><p>Their eyes bulged. Exchanging a glance, they turned and fled without hesitation.</p><p>Having eliminated the most formidable enemy, Qin Sang finally relaxed slightly, but it wasn't time to let his guard down. None of these three could escape!</p><p>The Yin-Yang Compass flipped, targeting the man in sturdy clothing, this time emitting a white light.</p><p>A powerful suction force made the man feel like he was sinking in quicksand. He hurriedly activated his seven-colored umbrella, which released a cascade of auspicious light, like soft swords, severing the Yin-Yang Compass's power.</p><p>But Qin Sang was faster. Before the man could break free from the suction, Qin Sang had closed the distance.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang used the same tactic again. The Heavenly Poison Gauze rose, and the miasma descended upon the man.</p><p>Having witnessed the scarred man's death from the Heavenly Poison Gauze, the man was terrified. He hurriedly raised the seven-colored umbrella to defend against the poison.</p><p>The power of the two magical tools clashed. The miasma and the seven-colored light seemed to cancel each other out, but Qin Sang was stronger. The umbrella's light quickly dimmed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang abruptly withdrew the Heavenly Poison Gauze. The Ebony Wood Sword followed, taking advantage of the weakened umbrella, piercing it from a tricky angle.</p><p>At the same moment, Yu Daiyue launched a sneak attack.</p><p>With the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, Yu Daiyue had no chance of escaping. He knew this, so when he saw Qin Sang engaging the other man, he secretly activated his octagonal bronze mirror.</p><p>A bronze beam of light shot towards Qin Sang's back.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>As if he had eyes in the back of his head, Qin Sang dodged with the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman the moment Yu Daiyue made his move.</p><p>The mirror's attack was fast, but it only struck an afterimage.</p><p>Yu Daiyue's face was ashen.  The difference in strength was one thing, but Qin Sang's speed was utterly despairing.</p><p>Just as the Ebony Wood Sword was about to strike the man in sturdy clothing, Qin Sang suddenly had a change of heart. At the last moment, he tilted the sword, avoiding vital points and piercing through the man's right chest.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The man cried out, but the cry abruptly stopped as the Heavenly Poison Gauze reappeared, the miasma seizing the chance to breach the weakened umbrella's defenses.</p><p>Consumed by the miasma, the man stiffened. Qin Sang flashed before him, his fingers moving swiftly, placing several restrictions to seal the man's meridians and spiritual sea, capturing him alive.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the man by the back of his neck and tossed him to the ground. He turned to watch Yu Daiyue fleeing, immediately giving chase.</p><p>Even without the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang was faster.</p><p>The distance between them rapidly closed. Just as Qin Sang was about to catch him, Yu Daiyue turned, throwing out countless talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang, anticipating this, abruptly stopped, easily dodging the attack before resuming his pursuit.</p><p>With one companion dead and another captured, Qin Sang was in no rush and took no risks, toying with Yu Daiyue like a cat with a mouse, wearing down his resources.</p><p>Yu Daiyue was ruthless. One magical tool after another was destroyed by Qin Sang. His spiritual power was nearly depleted, yet he hadn't managed to injure Qin Sang.  He had almost exhausted his resources, but he never uttered a single word of surrender or regret.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of offering him such an option.</p><p>Apart from Yu Daiyue's initial remark, the two had not exchanged a single word.</p><p>Finally, Yu Daiyue, his spiritual sea throbbing with pain, gritted his teeth and reached for his storage pouch, only to freeze.</p><p>It... was empty!</p><p>Yu Daiyue gave a bitter smile. Gathering the last of his spiritual power in his right hand, he slammed it towards his forehead.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, who had been holding back, finally used the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman again. He grabbed Yu Daiyue's arm, lightly chopped the back of his head, knocking him unconscious, and then sealed his spiritual sea.</p><p>Having captured Yu Daiyue alive, Qin Sang glanced towards Changyang Market, unsure if anyone had sensed the battle. But this place was no longer safe.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang quickly returned to the previous battlefield, erased any obvious traces, then grabbed the man in sturdy clothing and the scarred man's corpse and departed.</p><p>Soon after, several streaks of light arrived from Changyang Market, circling in the air for a while before dispersing.</p><p>Silence returned to the area.</p><p>Elsewhere, Qin Sang, carrying two captives, flew straight out of the rocky mountains and into a vast desert. After ensuring he wasn't followed, he burrowed into the sand, creating a hidden cave.</p>
