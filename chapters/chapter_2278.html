<h1>Chapter 2268: A Lonely Life</h1><p>A soul contract binds souls together.  Unless the contract is broken by the person who made it, even a powerful being can't undo it.  For example, even though the Emperor, Little Yellow Chicken, was once just a God-King and is now an Emperor, he couldn't break the contract with the Immortal Emperor.</p><p>To prevent betrayal and backlash, the Master Continent established a rule: even if someone transcends the Heavenly Dao Registry, they cannot escape a soul contract.</p><p>“A soul contract can't be severed from the consciousness sea. But I've absorbed a special energy that can even overcome Heavenly Dao, so breaking this contract isn't difficult… With enough power, it's just a matter of striking the contract's location!” the ruthless person explained.</p><p>Soul contracts are based on the Heavenly Dao.  A special energy that can overcome the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm can easily resolve a soul contract, if handled correctly.</p><p>“I see…” Zhang Xuan's eyes flickered.</p><p>“Considering I brought you to the God Realm, I thought I'd offer some explanation.”</p><p>After explaining, the ruthless person didn't say more.  Their aura grew increasingly ancient and distant, and the black hole behind them expanded, clearly absorbing more power for sustenance.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, the more the black hole absorbs, the stronger he gets…”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, noticing something wrong, urgently sent a voice transmission.</p><p>“Let's make our move!” With his doubts resolved, Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, raised his sword, and declared, “Then let's settle this!”</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>His most powerful sword intent erupted once again.</p><p>*To live is to return; to die is to yearn eternally. Life and death hold no fear, so what can stop me?*</p><p>This sword technique, though not at the level of an Emperor's understanding, contained all his resolve and pushed his Tian Ru You Qing technique to the limit.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>With one strike, he cleaved the ruthless person's attack in half.</p><p>At the same time, Luo Ruoxi attacked, her sword light as swift as snow.  Her swordsmanship resembled that of the young man from Sword God Heaven, possessing an unstoppable momentum and natural grace.</p><p>“Impressive techniques, but they're still lacking compared to mine…”</p><p>With a light smile, the ruthless person attacked again, their palm descending, covering the heavens and earth. Space shattered, and the sun, moon, and stars seemed to be about to be crushed.</p><p>*Pu! Pu!*</p><p>Zhang Xuan and Luo Ruoxi were both sent flying, spitting blood in mid-air.</p><p>Even with their power, they couldn't withstand the attack!</p><p>What kind of realm had this person reached?</p><p>“Audacious!”  The clone stepped forward, each step accompanied by blooming lotuses and the sound of flowing water.  It looked extremely impressive from afar.</p><p>Having refined the Nine Heavens Chaos Golden Lotus, his cultivation was no weaker than Zhang Xuan’s.</p><p>He launched a punch, its force reaching for the heavens.  He collided with the ruthless person and was similarly sent flying, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Zhang Xuan clutched his forehead.  Even as an Emperor, his clone still couldn't resist showing off…  Such flamboyant displays of power were less effective than concentrating that power into a single, more devastating blow!</p><p>“Attack together! If they die, we all die!”</p><p>Little Yellow Chicken roared, his crimson flames burning, setting the sky alight.  The remaining six Emperors also unleashed their power.</p><p>Seven Emperors combined their might, unleashing devastating power that could destroy a world. But their opponent, the ruthless person who had absorbed special power, simply allowed the black hole to grow, swallowing their attack in an instant and then counterattacking.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The seven Emperors, like Zhang Xuan and the others, were sent flying.</p><p>Ten Emperors united, yet they still couldn't withstand a single attack!</p><p>How could this person be so powerful?</p><p>“You may die now…”</p><p>Having defeated everyone with one move, the ruthless person stepped forward, and with a flick of their wrist, struck again.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>With a roar, the elder from Sword God Heaven suddenly appeared, blocking the attack with his long sword transforming into a silver river.</p><p>“An Emperor? He's also an Emperor?”</p><p>Zhang Xuan's pupils constricted.  He had initially assumed the elder was merely a follower of the young man, at most a titled God-King.  Only now, witnessing his power, did he realize he was also an Emperor!</p><p>If he was an Emperor, what was the young man?</p><p>“He is an Emperor of Sword God Heaven…”  Luo Ruoxi said gritting her teeth, struggling to stand.</p><p>“Then… what about the young man who taught me swordsmanship?” Zhang Xuan couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>“He is…” Luo Ruoxi started to answer, but space distorted.  Then, they saw the Sword God Heaven Emperor sent flying, crashing into the ground and creating a large crater.  Even though Zhang Xuan's current strength and swordsmanship far surpassed his own, he still couldn't withstand the ruthless person's attack.</p><p>"Ha ha, Your Majesty! They're just a bunch of rabble! Today, I will destroy the Nine Heavens, destroy this divine realm, and crush all its rules!"</p><p>The Emperor of Jian Shen Tian defeated, the ruthless one laughed wildly.  Space around him constantly collapsed, making him look demonic and monstrous.</p><p>"What do we do?" Zhang Xuan clenched his fists.</p><p>He and his clone had unleashed their strongest attacks, and even Luo Ruoxi had used her ultimate move, yet they couldn't withstand a single blow...</p><p>Could it be that no one in the divine realm can stop this person?</p><p>Just let him destroy the world?</p><p>"The only way… is to return the flawed Heavenly Dao fragment to its whole, allowing the Heavenly Dao to suppress him…" Luo Ruoxi clenched her delicate fists, her eyes reddening.</p><p>"Return it to its whole?" Zhang Xuan understood.</p><p>The library in his mind was a part of the Heavenly Dao. Once it returned, the Heavenly Dao would become complete, perhaps repairing the flaw and expelling the ruthless one.</p><p>Like a human immune system.</p><p>A complete immune system easily repels viruses; a damaged one can't resist viral invasion, and even the strongest person will die.</p><p>But…</p><p>"He's too powerful. Even if the Heavenly Dao is restored, it won't be able to suppress him!" Zhang Xuan shook his head.</p><p>The immune system can kill viruses, but… a tiger?</p><p>What can even the strongest immune system do?</p><p>This person, though just an ordinary God King, even with a title, the Heavenly Dao could easily kill him. But he is stronger than even the Emperor...beyond the Heavenly Dao's ability to contend with.</p><p>"This…" Luo Ruoxi paused, a look of disappointment on her fair face. "Yes… it can't suppress him, but with the Heavenly Dao complete, he can wake up, and killing this person won't be difficult!"</p><p>"He?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>"I'll take you to him, in Zi Zai Tian…" Taking a deep breath, Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth, turned, and flew forward.</p><p>"Trying to escape?" The ruthless one snorted, and pressed down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Ruoxi fell from the sky.</p><p>"You…" Zhang Xuan unleashed his swordsmanship again, his sword intent shining brightly.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>He was blocked again by the ruthless one.</p><p>"Go! I'll hold him off…"</p><p>Knowing they needed to find a way to save the divine realm, not escape, the clone and the Immortal Emperor shouted, standing in front. Luo Qiqi transformed back into her Jing Kong Pearl form.</p><p>Space around them solidified.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Seeing everyone selflessly standing in the rear, unafraid of death, Zhang Xuan's eyes reddened. But he knew this wasn't the time to talk. He pulled Luo Ruoxi, his body flickered, tearing through space, and the next moment they were within the borders of Zi Zai Tian.</p><p>Zi Zai Tian was no longer peaceful. The divine realm was collapsing, everything in chaos.</p><p>"Where's the person you mentioned?"</p><p>Having no time to observe the lives of ordinary people, Zhang Xuan looked at the girl in his arms.</p><p>If this person could truly save the divine realm, what did his sacrifice matter!</p><p>"He's my father. The blood in your pendant is his. The Immortal Emperor was once his pet beast…" Luo Ruoxi took a breath and explained.</p><p>"Father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder he always felt the blood in the pendant was similar to Luo Ruoxi's yet different. It was her father's.</p><p>This also explained why the remaining thought of the Immortal Emperor immediately acknowledged him as master after seeing the pendant.</p><p>"Your father is also an Emperor? Or possesses power beyond an Emperor?"</p><p>He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The library's chaos, the blood in the pendant, had allowed him to regain clarity. Could it be that not only was she an Emperor, but her father was too, and even stronger?</p><p>If that were the case, why was he unconscious?</p><p>Why was the flawed Heavenly Dao needed to wake him?</p><p>"He isn't an Emperor, he's… the Heavenly Dao!"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi clenched her delicate fists.</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao? Your father… is the Heavenly Dao?" Zhang Xuan was shocked, disbelieving.</p><p>"Yes! Fifty years ago, Father couldn't withstand that giant hand and fell into a coma. The Heavenly Dao scattered into three parts: the Ordered Heavenly Dao, the Flawed Heavenly Dao, entering spatial currents. I took over control of the Natural Heavenly Dao, maintaining the balance of the divine realm. To restore him, I need to gather the scattered parts… That's why I'm so determined, I can't fail! That's why I specifically went to the Master's Continent, studied the Spring and Autumn Annals, trying to defeat Master Kong!  When I fought Master Kong, the favor I asked of him was related to this."</p><p>Luo Ruoxi explained.</p><p>Zhang Xuan understood.</p><p>He had just met her in Master’s Continent, and she had told him her story, about saving a loved one. He didn’t understand then, but now he understood.</p><p>It was her father, and he was the Heavenly Dao of the divine realm!</p><p>Could the Heavenly Dao really take human form and have children?</p><p>"Taking over the Natural Heavenly Dao… You don't have a Heavenly Dao fragment within you?" Suddenly realizing something was amiss in her words, Zhang Xuan looked at her.</p><p>Being controlled and being one with it are two different concepts.</p><p>"I merely control it; I'm not part of the Heavenly Dao…" Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>This meant he only needed to separate the Heavenly Dao flaw; he didn't need her to die.</p><p>Though he didn't want this fate, he also didn't want the girl before him to be harmed.</p><p>"If I separate the Heavenly Dao flaw within me, your father can be revived, and even the Ruthless One can be defeated, right?" Zhang Xuan asked.</p><p>"That… I'm not sure…"</p><p>Looking up at the shattered divine realm, Luo Ruoxi hesitated.</p><p>The divine realm was her father's foundation.  Even if he woke up, could he really defeat such a powerful Ruthless One, with the realm in this state?</p><p>It was hard to say!</p><p>"It seems you can't be certain either. If so, we should rely on ourselves… We have to find our own way!" Zhang Xuan gritted his teeth. "You, me, my clone, along with the Nine Heavens Nine Emperors, and if we cooperate with Kong Shi, we might have a chance of winning!"</p><p>"Kong Shi? He…" Luo Ruoxi frowned.</p><p>"Kong Shi is dead, you say! He wasn't truly dead. If I'm not mistaken, his supposed death at your hands was just a method to escape the Heavenly Dao…  He should be, like Wei Changfeng, a 'Primordial Soul Body'!"</p><p>Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Seeing Wei Changfeng, he understood. Kong Shi's supposed preservation of his intellect was likely due to being a Primordial Soul Body as well.</p><p>Capable of remaining conscious even before birth.</p><p>Coupled with pre-arranged contingencies, his resurrection was only a matter of time.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was stunned; she hadn't expected this.</p><p>"Let's go and see. If my guess is right, he should have already recovered. Otherwise, his students wouldn't have stayed away from the Tidal Sea…" Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Kong Shi's students, Zi Yuan Gu Sheng and the others, were all incredibly powerful. Even without the Emperor's help, they would certainly have found a way to enter the Tidal Sea, yet none appeared.</p><p>There must be something more important they were waiting for, something to be done while all the Emperors were preoccupied at the Tidal Sea!</p><p>And that important thing was clearly Kong Shi's recovery.</p><p>"This…" Luo Ruoxi was startled, suddenly understanding.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Without further explanation, with a sweep of his hand, Zhang Xuan reappeared at Kong Shi's residence.  There, he saw an old man levitating cross-legged in the air. Seeing them, the old man smiled slightly: "You've come!"</p><p>If it wasn't Kong Shi, who else could it be!</p><p>This master of ages hadn't disappointed him!</p><p>Just as he guessed, he had resurrected while everyone was focused on the Tidal Sea.</p><p>"You…" Luo Ruoxi trembled.</p><p>She knew Emperors could be resurrected, that even the immortal Emperors had been revived, but… she hadn't expected it to be this fast!</p><p>"I concealed it from the Heavenly Dao, preparing contingencies in advance. The nameless giant in the Nether Soul Pool was my doing.  When you killed it, I used the opportunity to break free from the Heavenly Dao's constraints and reconstitute my physical body. I've only just recovered."</p><p>Kong Shi smiled faintly.</p><p>He was proficient in manipulating time.  While it seemed only a day or two had passed in the divine realm, in reality, he'd spent an unknown amount of time recovering his strength.</p><p>It could have been decades.</p><p>"The three of us are strong, but defeating the Ruthless One won't be easy…"</p><p>Seeing Kong Shi's true recovery, Luo Ruoxi still shook her head.</p><p>It wasn't about belittling themselves or boosting the opponent's morale; it was the reality.</p><p>Even with so many of them combined, they still couldn't stop the opponent.  Adding Kong Shi wouldn't change that.</p><p>It wouldn't change the situation!</p><p>"Individually, and even combined, our strength isn't enough to defeat the opponent.  But… what if we combined everyone's power into one person?"</p><p>Kong Shi looked at them, smiling.</p><p>"Combine it into one person?"</p><p>This time, not only Luo Ruoxi frowned, but Zhang Xuan was also full of doubt.</p><p>"That hand could tear apart the divine realm and scatter the Heavenly Dao. Its power is undeniable. The Ruthless One absorbed all that power and devoured fifty years' worth of the divine realm's spiritual energy. In terms of raw strength, even if we take each of our dozen Emperors individually, they're no match…"</p><p>Kong Shi said: "But combined, concentrating that power onto one person… that might be different!"</p><p>"How do we concentrate it?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi looked at him.</p><p>It's easy to say, but hard to do.</p><p>The Emperors are already at the peak of the divine realm. If it was that easy to absorb others' power, she wouldn't have stagnated for so many years.</p><p>"It's simple… we concentrate our power onto Zhang Xuan. Once he breaks through the Emperor's shackles, he can save the divine realm!"</p><p>Kong Shi said.</p><p>"Me?" Zhang Xuan was startled. "Why me?"</p><p>"The Lingxi Emperor cultivates freedom and transcendence! But with the constraints of his father and Heaven, and with loved ones, he can never truly transcend! If I'm not mistaken, during our battle, you also gave up, intending to be killed by me!" Kong Shi said.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was speechless.</p><p>During the battle, she had indeed harbored such thoughts.  Therefore, their initial exchange felt more like a sparring match than a fight to the death.</p><p>"Inability to transcend naturally limits one's strength. Even with more true energy, one cannot reach the highest realm! As for me..."</p><p>Kong Shi nodded. "I care for all beings and wish to save the world, yet I'm unwilling to let others sacrifice for me. Too much compassion is a flaw! If I had been ruthless and annihilated the Yiling, this situation wouldn't have arisen..."</p><p>If the Yiling had been completely wiped out, the Ruthless One wouldn't have been resurrected, and this wouldn't be happening.</p><p>"So, I'm not suitable either!  But Zhang Xuan's cultivation suits him perfectly; he has no flaws. He lives his life on his own terms, and even if he dies, as long as he lives without regret, his heart remains pure. Such a person possesses greater tolerance and potential for growth. Only someone like him can go higher and further!"</p><p>Kong Shi continued.</p><p>To live is to return, to die is to be remembered!</p><p>Someone who doesn't fear death won't be bound by anything else.</p><p>"This..." Zhang Xuan frowned, about to speak, when he saw Kong Shi's intense gaze. "Don't refuse. Even if we had time to cultivate others, I doubt anyone would do better.  While the Lingxi Emperor doesn't possess a Heaven's shard, he has long controlled Heaven and has his own understanding of it; I control Heaven in an orderly manner. If we infuse our power into you, you'll possess the complete power of Heaven! Combined with your clone's Nine Heavens Chaotic Golden Lotus, you can stabilize the Nine Heavens, control the universe, battle the Nine Skies, and destroy all things!"</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Seeing that the decision had been made, and further explanation would be futile, Zhang Xuan nodded.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He sat cross-legged, and in the blink of an eye, two powerful forces surged from both sides.</p><p>Zhang Xuan stiffened, as if instantly transforming into Heaven, soaring above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>His soul, body, and true energy were all instantly cleansed, becoming stronger and more powerful.</p><p>...</p><p>"You want to stop me? Fine. After killing you, I'll kill Zhang Xuan..."</p><p>After sending Luo Qiqi and his clone flying, the Ruthless One sneered coldly.</p><p>The combined power of the clone and the numerous Emperors was indeed formidable, but it was still weaker than him.</p><p>The Tidal Sea had absorbed almost all the spiritual energy outside the city in the God Realm. Now, this energy had become his sustenance, empowering him with the ability to destroy the world. These Emperors and God Kings, despite representing the peak of the God Realm, were no match for him.</p><p>The Ruthless One now seemed to represent the entire God Realm, unstoppable.</p><p>"With the God Realm destroyed, there's no meaning to our lives. I, Yun Chi, will perish with you..."</p><p>Yun Chi the Great transformed into his true form, a massive five-clawed golden dragon, soaring towards him.</p><p>"You? Not worthy!"</p><p>The Ruthless One squeezed his hand, trapping the golden dragon in his palm.  It struggled in vain, unable to escape.</p><p>"Old friend, wait for me!"</p><p>Fu Meng the Great roared, transforming into his white tiger form and appearing before him.</p><p>The Immortal Emperor, in his immortal fire phoenix form, illuminated the sky with flames.</p><p>Xuan Ming the Great, whose true form was a giant turtle, seemed to support the heavens.</p><p>The four divine beasts, guardians of the four cardinal points of the God Realm, simultaneously transformed, slowing the collapse of the God Realm.</p><p>Time and space seemed to freeze.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With four consecutive strikes, the Ruthless One suppressed the four beasts.  A strong killing intent flashed in his eyes: "Since you seek death, I'll grant it to you..."</p><p>As he roared and was about to kill them all, he felt his raised arm tighten and stop in mid-air.</p><p>"Want to kill them? Ask me first..."</p><p>Then, to the astonishment of everyone, a figure slowly descended from the sky.</p><p>It was Zhang Xuan!</p><p>The young man now possessed overwhelming power, ten times stronger than before. He descended from the heavens, like a world unto himself.</p><p>"Quite the improvement..."</p><p>The Ruthless One stopped, his gaze solemn.</p><p>He clearly didn't understand how the other's strength had increased so dramatically in just a few minutes.</p><p>"But what does it matter? Even the God Realm at its peak couldn't withstand me. I don't believe you can stop me..."</p><p>With a cold snort, the Ruthless One attacked again.</p><p>Zhang Xuan raised his sword and met him.</p><p>Their battle tore apart space, sending air currents flying everywhere.</p><p>Could Zhang Xuan win?</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, stationed at Kong Shi's base, watched with worry.</p><p>She and Kong Shi had transferred their power to Zhang Xuan, reducing their own cultivation to the God King level; their former glory was gone.  However, their level remained; with enough power, they could eventually recover.</p><p>"With his current strength, winning is… difficult! Unless… he can grasp power beyond the Emperor Jun level!" Kong Shi said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Even a dozen Emperor Juns combined couldn't defeat the Ruthless One. Even if they transferred all their power, victory wouldn't be easy. They did this because… only by concentrating power in one person could they possibly reach the peak, truly transcend their limits, and break through!</p><p>"Power beyond the Emperor Jun level?" Luo Ruoxi's gaze drifted.</p><p>Her father, when he was still alive, had spoken of the same thing, but… she couldn't do it. Could the man she loved?</p><p>"He can… He has an unyielding heart! And a proud defiance of the world," Kong Shi smiled, seeing her question.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After several consecutive attacks, Zhang Xuan's knuckles cracked, and a huge, horrifying wound appeared on his chest. As Kong Shi had said, even with the combined power of the two of them, forming a complete Heavenly Dao within him, he was still no match.</p><p>"Haha, I thought you were powerful.  So-so!" the Ruthless One sneered.</p><p>"Anyway, I'm no match for you. I'll be killed sooner or later.  Since that's the case, I want to die from your strongest attack…" Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, stopped attacking, and looked at the Ruthless One.</p><p>"Fine, I'll grant you that. I'll give you my strongest attack…"</p><p>Hearing this, the Ruthless One paused, then snorted coldly, raising his hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A green light appeared in his palm and slammed down.</p><p>It was indeed his strongest attack. The entire divine realm rumbled, as if it couldn't bear the force, creating another massive crater.</p><p>With his eyes closed, Zhang Xuan didn't dodge.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His head exploded, his soul scattering.</p><p>"Zhang Xuan…"  Everyone's faces turned pale at this sight.</p><p>Luo Qiqiu seemed to go mad.</p><p>Yun Chi Dadi and the others' eyes widened, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi were also stunned.</p><p>Their intention was for him to break through his shackles and reach a realm beyond Emperor Jun. Why didn't he resist? Why did he willingly accept death?  Wasn't this ungrateful for their efforts?</p><p>"No, it's the Immortal Emperor's immortal technique…"</p><p>Just as they were puzzled, Kong Shi suddenly spoke.</p><p>Everyone then saw that from Zhang Xuan's exploded head, even with his shattered soul, the pendant on his chest suddenly burst, a drop of blood hovering and igniting, forming a ball of intense flame. From within the flames, a completely unharmed figure slowly emerged.</p><p>"He… used the opponent's power and the blood in the pendant to separate the flawed Heavenly Dao and his soul?" Luo Ruoxi's pupils constricted.</p><p>The reborn Zhang Xuan no longer had the Heavenly Dao Library within him, free from the Heavenly Dao's interference, detached from it!</p><p>"How did he do it?" Kong Shi was incredulous.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao and soul merged, inseparable. To escape, he had to shatter his soul, relying on the Nether Soul Pool to reconstitute it. This one, merely slain once, had completely escaped. What method did he use?</p><p>"I know… He used the Ruthless One's method of breaking the soul contract…" Luo Ruoxi realized.</p><p>A soul contract binds master and servant; unless the master releases it, the servant remains bound… The Heavenly Dao Library is similar, a strengthened version of a contract.</p><p>Bound to the soul, one couldn't escape without death.</p><p>But… the Ruthless One used a special power to break his soul contract. Zhang Xuan had inquired about the method in detail, and he likely had the idea then.</p><p>That's why he deliberately fought to the death, allowing the Ruthless One to unleash his strongest attack.</p><p>Using this power, he was reborn from the flames, and surprisingly, he succeeded!</p><p>"So that's it. That's the method to surpass Emperor Jun…"</p><p>Zhang Xuan, emerging from the flames, smiled faintly, as if understanding something. He gestured, and his clone on the side instantly transformed back into a lotus flower and flew towards him.</p><p>In an instant, he perfectly merged with it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, everyone felt that Zhang Xuan had become the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Heavens were him.</p><p>He lightly tapped his foot on the ground.</p><p>The chaotic Nine Heavens immediately stabilized.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Primordial Golden Lotus, born at the creation of the Nine Heavens, stabilizes it.  With his self and avatar perfectly merged, he now commands its power.</p><p>Not only that, but his already peak cultivation, enhanced by the Lotus, showed signs of breakthrough, as if ready to transcend at any moment.</p><p>“Master-servant bond, brotherhood, teacher-student bond, familial love, romantic love… merging them all, reveals the essence of all things. This is what it means to be human!”</p><p>Zhang Xuan murmured, a smile on his face.</p><p>The moment the Heavenly Dao Library separated from his soul, he understood.</p><p>Did humans create the world, or did the world precede humanity?  Is it the wind that moves, or the heart?</p><p>This age-old question has plagued countless individuals.  But now… it's irrelevant!</p><p>Without life, without emotion, what meaning does the world hold, even if it exists?</p><p>Therefore, transcending romantic love led to universal compassion!  The interwoven emotions of the world.</p><p>All things possess emotion; emotion creates the world; emotion sustains life.</p><p>Love is emotion.</p><p>Hate is emotion.</p><p>Joy is emotion.</p><p>Pain is emotion.</p><p>Parting is emotion.</p><p>Reunion is also emotion!</p><p>“All emotions, I command them…”</p><p>With a low cry, the barriers to his cultivation within Zhang Xuan shattered.</p><p>The Emperor's shackles were broken!</p><p>In an instant, he touched a new world, a new door; his soul rapidly nourished.</p><p>Countless chaotic energies surged forth, his physical body rapidly strengthening.</p><p>Before, only absorbing spiritual energy brought advancement. Now, spatial currents, chaotic energy, even the opponent’s green light—all became his, inseparable from him.</p><p>“You…” Hen Ren never expected that her all-out attack, far from killing him, had instead empowered him. Furious, she shrieked, launching another attack.</p><p>“Your resentment towards the high and mighty Emperors for not saving you in the spatial currents is emotion; the feeling of being my former servant, of humiliation and anger, is emotion; your desire to destroy the Divine Realm, to vent your fury, is emotion; your yearning for greater power, that too is emotion… Emotion controls you. How can you possibly defeat me, surpass my control?”</p><p>With a faint smile, Zhang Xuan's voice grew faster, louder. He gently reached out.</p><p>The once invincible Hen Ren was bound by countless emotional threads, immobilized, helpless.</p><p>All emotion was to be used, controlled, by him.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Terror filled Hen Ren’s eyes:  “Master Zhang, I was your servant, please don’t kill me… I offer my soul as a sacrifice…”</p><p>“It's too late for such talk…” Zhang Xuan smiled faintly, shaking his head.</p><p>Controlling the emotions of the world rendered concepts like servitude meaningless.</p><p>After killing so many gods, hurting his girlfriend Luo Qiqi and so many friends, forgiveness was impossible today!</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Sensing his resolve, Hen Ren's pupils contracted. Before she could finish, searing pain surged through her.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In a flash, she exploded, transforming into countless strands of spiritual energy that poured into the Divine Realm.</p><p>The power devoured by the Tidal Sea earlier now flowed back, revitalizing the barren lands.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“She’s dead just like that?”</p><p>Yun Chi Dadi, Bu Si Di Jun, Linglong Xianzi, and others stared wide-eyed in disbelief.</p><p>They had fought Hen Ren and knew her terrifying power.  To have annihilated such a strong opponent so easily… what level of strength had Zhang Xuan reached?</p><p>Could there be realms beyond the Emperors?</p><p>“He succeeded…”</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi unclenched their fists.</p><p>“This is a fragment of the Heavenly Dao. I shall return it now…”</p><p>Seeing the “incomplete Heavenly Dao,” which had been separated from his body, still suspended in the air, Zhang Xuan smiled softly and flicked his finger.</p><p>Hum!</p><p>The library, his companion since his rebirth, resonated as it embedded itself into the Divine Realm's sky.</p><p>A bell-like resonance echoed. The crumbling Divine Realm visibly began to slowly heal; the chaotic currents gradually coalesced.</p><p>The collapse ceased; the depleted spiritual energy, along with Hen Ren's demise, slowly revived.</p><p>“It seems the Divine Realm is entering a new era of spiritual resurgence…” Zhang Xuan smiled.</p><p>The Tidal Sea's chasm, along with the Heavenly Dao's restoration, was repaired.  The Divine Realm's return to its former glory was merely a matter of time.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, come here…”</p><p>A voice echoed in his mind.  Zhang Xuan paused, then took a step.</p><p>The step took him an immeasurable distance.  A young man stood before him.</p><p>It was the one who had taught him swordsmanship.</p><p>“Senior, you…”</p><p>Zhang Xuan stared, astonished.</p><p>I sensed his unfathomable depth before, but now I realize he's only a hair's breadth away from my own level. He's reached the peak of Emperor-level strength, far surpassing even Luo Ruoxi.</p><p>"Just call me by my name. I'm... Nie Tong!"  The young man, radiating an indomitable sword intent, said calmly.</p><p>"Nie Tong?" Zhang Xuan frowned.  He'd never heard that name before.</p><p>"Come with me. I'll introduce you to my brother," Nie Tong smiled gently and strode forward.</p><p>Zhang Xuan followed closely behind, flying for an unknown distance before stopping at a mountain peak.  Then he saw another young man.</p><p>His appearance wasn't much different, but his raised eyebrows gave him a profound, unreadable air.</p><p>"His strength..." Zhang Xuan gasped.  This young man's power surpassed even his own; he too had broken through the Emperor-level barrier, but his cultivation was even deeper and more substantial!</p><p>"I am Nie Yun," the young man smiled faintly, his gaze settling on Zhang Xuan. "And I am… the father of Nie Lingxi, the Luo Ruoxi you know."</p><p>"Ruoxi's father?" Zhang Xuan was stunned. "You... are the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi had mentioned her father was the Heavenly Dao.  He never imagined it would be such a young man.</p><p>"I used the 'One Qi Transforms Three Pure Ones' technique.  Part of my soul became the Heavenly Dao! Besides, I created this world, so calling me the Heavenly Dao isn't entirely wrong," Nie Yun chuckled softly.</p><p>Zhang Xuan couldn't believe it.  This man created the God Realm?  How powerful must he be?</p><p>"But if you created the God Realm and are the Heavenly Dao, why did you allow the villains to wreak havoc without intervening...?" Zhang Xuan questioned.</p><p>If he hadn't broken through, the God Realm might have collapsed entirely. Why did this man remain indifferent? Did he even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>Without answering, Nie Yun calmly looked at him, "Do you believe... that there are even more powerful beings beyond the God Realm?"</p><p>"That..." Zhang Xuan hesitated, "Probably... yes."</p><p>He'd never seen them, but if he could reach this level, perhaps others could, even stronger ones. Like the one before him.</p><p>"I suspected the existence of more powerful beings beyond the God Realm, so I tried my best to perceive them. This ultimately attracted a backlash from a higher world... a hand descended from the void!"  Nie Yun explained.  "If I had dodged, the entire God Realm would likely have been obliterated, leaving not a single life.  So I blocked the attack, but because of this, the Heavenly Dao aspect of myself was fractured."</p><p>"Restoring myself is merely a matter of intent, but... I understand that to truly transcend the God Realm's limitations, to explore the origin of that hand and what lies beyond... it's difficult to achieve alone.  So I wanted to see if any beings could break through the Emperor-level barrier and reach my level!"</p><p>"Therefore, I sent fragmented aspects of the Heavenly Dao to the lowest world... bestowing them upon souls that originally belonged to this world, and one that didn't. And you, you didn't disappoint me!" Nie Yun laughed.</p><p>"A soul not from this world... so my transmigration was also your doing?" Zhang Xuan was shocked.</p><p>No wonder he could cross over. It was all this man's plan.</p><p>"Haha!" Nie Yun chuckled softly. "Those who inherently belong to this world have a natural reverence for it, making it far more difficult to break through its constraints.  It was a whim on my part, and I didn't expect you to actually succeed..."</p><p>"I..." Zhang Xuan blushed. "Without Kong Shi's selfless dedication, I never could have reached this point..."</p><p>Without Kong Shi's sacrifice, reaching his current level would have been impossible.</p><p>"I gave him the opportunity, but he didn't seize it. His duel with Lingxi was the perfect chance for him to break through, but he chose to retreat.  He thought he had a backup plan to ensure his safety, but he actually lost the drive to forge ahead.  When facing someone who surpasses you, if you don't have that spirit, how can you possibly contend?" Nie Yun stated.</p><p>Zhang Xuan remained silent.  He had witnessed the fight between the two; Kong Shi had indeed lacked decisiveness.</p><p>Perhaps he didn't want to kill Luo Ruoxi.  But that single thought cost him the chance to advance.</p><p>"If Kong Shi had won, Ruoxi would have died..." After a moment, Zhang Xuan looked up, his brow furrowed.  Could it be that this man didn't even care about his daughter's life?</p><p>"With me here, she wouldn't have died," Nie Yun smiled faintly. "Your strength is almost equal to mine now. Do you think, in a life-or-death situation, you two could have saved someone?"</p><p>"That..." Zhang Xuan gave a wry smile.</p><p>The Emperor's breakthrough and the Emperor himself are two different concepts. If he were truly willing to intervene, he could certainly save the person at the last moment, ensuring they wouldn't suffer a single scratch.</p><p>"Lingxi is my other wife, Luo Qingcheng's daughter, so her assumed surname is Luo... To make her believe, and avoid emotional involvement, she has been led to believe I remain in a coma..."</p><p>Nie Yun chuckled wryly: "I guess I've been a pretty ruthless father...  Let you explain this to her.  Her affections are already focused on you; I'm practically forgotten!  Haha, I'll disappear for a while.  Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll raise hell…"</p><p>Seeing her unreliable father, Zhang Xuan's face twitched. He could only agree: "Alright…"</p><p>He had no choice. After all, he had taken his daughter.</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao Library is a manifestation of my will, both my foundation and my constraint. Your ability to overcome it demonstrates your potential.  Your future is limitless. As her father, I'm relieved she's with you."</p><p>(To be continued…)</p>
