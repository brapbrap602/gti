Chapter 479: Harvest


“A soul-reaping artifact?”


The man in yellow armor eyed the Ten Directions Yama Banner with amusement.  “To my knowledge, the Shadowless Sword originates from Shaohua Mountain, a righteous sect.  In Xiaohan region, righteous and demonic sects stand opposed, with the righteous sects always putting on a pious act.  I never expected that Shaohua Mountain’s famed Shadowless Sword would be used to forge so many soul-reaping artifacts, causing untold suffering.  If this gets out, it’ll cause a huge uproar, won't it?  I wonder if Shaohua Mountain is willing to purge its ranks.”


“Then let's make sure it doesn't get out,”


Qin Sang ignored the man’s threat, saying calmly.


‘Whoosh…’


The banner array roared, and endless ghost flames erupted.


The entire array, including Qin Sang, was engulfed in ghost fire.


Flames shot towards the sky.


The Town Mountain Stele hummed.


The lower half of the giant stele was surrounded by ghost fire.  The Xuanhuang energy continuously emanated from the stele, but it seemed powerless against the aggressive ghost flames.


The Xuanhuang energy could only defend the area around the stele, but it was still being steadily consumed by the ghost fire.


The Ten Directions Yama Banner’s power surpassed that of a talisman treasure; hence, it could easily withstand the Mountain-Shaking Stele’s sneak attack, and its counterattack was naturally extremely fierce.


The Mountain-Shaking Stele was no match for the Ten Directions Yama Banner, but it wouldn't be instantly shattered either.


Seeing this, the man in yellow armor’s expression turned serious. He coldly snorted, “I admit this soul-reaping artifact of yours is indeed extraordinary, but I wonder how long it can sustain itself in battle.”


He could clearly see that the Ten Directions Yama Banner’s consumption was considerable, especially during intense combat. If the user’s spiritual energy was depleted first, even the strongest artifact would be useless.


Qin Sang’s cultivation was below the False Core stage, one level below him.  Moreover, he was confident in his unique armor, so he wasn’t afraid of the Ten Directions Yama Banner at all.


“Fall!”


The man in yellow armor roared, unleashing the full power of his talisman treasure.


The inscriptions on the Mountain-Shaking Stele glowed with Xuanhuang light, its weight suddenly increasing several times, forcefully suppressing the ghost fire and slowly descending.


A thunderous sound echoed where the ghost fire and the Mountain-Shaking Stele met.


Clusters of ghost fire were extinguished.


On the other hand, the Mountain-Shaking Stele's situation was worse. Its base began to crack. Initially, only a thin crack appeared, but as the stele slowly descended, it quickly spread, like a spiderweb, across its lower half.


‘Crack!’


With a crisp sound, a large chunk of the Mountain-Shaking Stele finally broke off and fell, disappearing instantly, possibly swallowed by the ghost fire.


The man in yellow armor paid it no mind. He unleashed the talisman treasure’s power without reservation.


Accompanied by a series of explosive sounds, the Mountain-Shaking Stele disintegrated faster and faster, as if being devoured by the ghost fire, disappearing layer by layer at a visible rate.


Finally, only half of the Town Mountain Stele remained, and it was also riddled with cracks.


‘Boom!’


The Mountain-Shaking Stele suddenly exploded.


A powerful gust of wind scattered outwards, pushing back the ghost fire. At that moment, the armor on the man in yellow armor suddenly emitted an intense Xuanhuang light.


The originally separate pieces of armor merged into one in the yellow light, leaving no gaps, including the man’s face.


The man in yellow armor transformed into a true armored warrior.


He raised both hands, and the armor's light madly converged towards his palms, finally condensing into a majestic war halberd.


‘Swish!’


The man in yellow armor, wielding the halberd, casually cut off a corner of the black stone.


The next moment, the man’s figure suddenly disappeared from his spot and reappeared above the Mountain-Shaking Stele, precisely when it exploded.  Under the cover of the strong wind, his figure spun rapidly.


Man and halberd descended like a meteor, striking fiercely at the sea of fire.


The man in yellow armor didn't know that, when he detonated the Town Mountain Stele, a flame far deeper and purer than the ghost fire quietly emerged from the depths of the sea of fire.


Nine Nether Demon Flame!


Within the Ten Directions Yama Formation, the ten main souls collectively raised the Ten Directions Yama Banner. Qin Sang forced out his essence blood, secretly activating the artifact.


Qin Sang had already made up his mind—he absolutely couldn't let the man in yellow armor escape!


Since this place was heavily restricted, if he couldn't achieve a quick victory and the man found an opportunity, escape would be easy. Therefore, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to use the Ten Directions Yama Banner artifact.


He considered Huang Jia Ren a formidable enemy, having long understood that Huang Jia Ren excelled in close-quarters combat.  His powerful armor and fighting skills rendered opponents helpless.

This was the moment!

The magical artifact not only devoured Qin Sang's blood essence but also rapidly consumed his spiritual energy like a bottomless pit.

A surge of Nine Netherworld Flames erupted from the artifact.  Following Qin Sang's will, it transformed into the shape of a black sword, shooting upwards like a released arrow.

At that moment, Jin Jia Ren lunged forward. Sensing an unusually sharp energy within the inferno, something extraordinary, he showed no fear, instead sneering, "I knew you had an unusual spirit sword!"

"Wu Ci Sand!"

Holding his halberd in one hand, he suddenly flung a handful of gray sand.

Wu Ci Sand, a peculiar substance developed by the Tian Xing League's artisans, was remarkably effective against flying swords and similar spirit weapons.  The heavy sand adhered to the flying sword, making it incredibly cumbersome and significantly reducing its power.

'Whoosh!'

The Nine Netherworld Flames burst from the inferno.

A shocking sight unfolded before Huang Jia Ren:  the Wu Ci Sand, instead of clinging to the black sword, was directly absorbed by it.

This was no mere sword; it was a terrifyingly potent flame!

'Whoosh!'

The Nine Netherworld Flames revealed its true form, its terrifying aura sweeping outwards.  Qin Sang no longer concealed it, dispersing the ghost fire.

On the ground, amongst the flags, the exceptionally tall Ten Directions Yama Banner caused Huang Jia Ren's hair to stand on end.

"A magical artifact!"

Terror gripped Huang Jia Ren.  He let out a startled cry, desperately trying to stop and flee upwards, but it was too late. The Nine Netherworld Flames had arrived, engulfing him.

'Crack!'

No matter how formidable Huang Jia Ren's armor, it couldn't withstand the Nine Netherworld Flames.  It visibly turned into a mass of scrap metal, devoured by the demonic fire.

Without his armor, Huang Jia Ren was like a man stripped naked in the street, facing the Nine Netherworld Flames alone.

The terrifying flames were inches away.

Even with Huang Jia Ren frantically pouring his spiritual energy into his defense, it was useless. The breath of death filled him with despair.

Even more terrifying, he sensed an aura within the Nine Netherworld Flames that assaulted his primordial spirit.  This aura slowed his thoughts, hindering his instinctive reaction to retrieve another artifact. His movements were too slow.

My life is forfeit!

Huang Jia Ren closed his eyes in despair.  His primordial spirit was severely injured, causing him to fall unconscious.

At the last moment, Qin Sang suddenly made a hand seal, halting the Nine Netherworld Flames and preventing them from completely consuming Huang Jia Ren.

He dashed to Huang Jia Ren's side, and seeing that he wasn't dead, he was overjoyed. He cast several restrictive spells to seal Huang Jia Ren's cultivation, then fed him several healing pills.

Finally, he had captured a Nascent Soul stage cultivator through his own strength. Unlike the handsome young man, this one posed no risk of bringing unwanted attention if taken away.
