<h1>Chapter 1443: Success</h1><p>Hard to believe.</p><p>Even Heavenly Thunder can feel like being torn apart.</p><p>A palm print ripped through the thunder.</p><p>Elder Ye appeared, his expression grim, killing intent surging.</p><p>The hand that had torn through the thunder wore a white glove, seemingly woven from silk, thin and delicate.  Stars were etched on the back, and the sun and moon were held in the palm.</p><p>This was a powerful artifact, likely not of this world.</p><p>Stars circled the palm, the sun and moon shone together, the thunder magic was broken, unable to approach.</p><p>His body was charred, his skin clearly bearing the marks of the *Thunder Control Technique*, but it didn't look as severe as one might imagine.</p><p>However, this was merely a superficial appearance.</p><p>Elder Ye, breaking his seal again, forcibly used the artifact to escape, paying a price unimaginable to ordinary people – a price not visible on the surface.</p><p>His eyes, sharp as knives, fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>"That old geezer actually had a backup plan!"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and angry.</p><p>Stared at by Elder Ye, he felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Seeing the dazzling escape light around Qin Sang, a flicker of surprise crossed Elder Ye's eyes.  Seizing the remaining opportunity, he pushed off the ground, pursuing at a speed even faster than Qin Sang.</p><p>Another heart-stopping chase unfolded within the cave, witnessed by everyone.</p><p>One side possessed unparalleled escape techniques, no wonder he dared to steal treasure from a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The other, while seemingly lacking such refined techniques, proved superior.</p><p>The distance between them rapidly closed.</p><p>A gust of wind hit his back, sending shivers down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reached the cave entrance, where Ming Wei was waiting.</p><p>Without hesitation, he rushed into the cave, swiftly casting seals.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Magic banners rose from the ground.</p><p>They had been hidden for a long time, finally put to use.</p><p>In an instant, the banners formed an array, and the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire erupted, its flames reaching the sky.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Before the fire fully coalesced, Qin Sang made a hand seal, drawing it back.  Then he gathered all the banners and charged deeper into the cave, finding Ming Wei, her face etched with anxiety.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire burst out of the cave.</p><p>Elder Ye, hot on his heels, was the first to be hit.</p><p>Seeing the vast Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and sensing its aura, Elder Ye was stunned, then his face changed, and he exclaimed, "True Demon Flame!"</p><p>He stopped abruptly, his artifact-clad hand quickly raised to his chest, activating the artifact to protect himself, clearly wary of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The fire and the palm print collided.</p><p>Rocks crumbled, demon flames flew.</p><p>The palm print dimmed, the stars shattered, the sun and moon lost their light; the artifact on Elder Ye's hand melted like ice and snow, having been used twice and almost exhausted.</p><p>Amid the chaos, Elder Ye's furious roar echoed.</p><p>"A mere imitation! Not the real True Demon Flame!"</p><p>Regardless of the loss, he pushed the artifact's remaining power, breaking through the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire blockade, only to find the cave empty.</p><p>Ming Wei, following Qin Sang's instructions, had been waiting at the entrance.</p><p>She witnessed Elder Ye's attack, no longer doubting Qin Sang's words. Instead, she worried about whether he could succeed in obtaining the Soul Cleansing Liquid and sharing a bottle with her, as agreed.</p><p>Then she saw Qin Sang's bold move.</p><p>Thunder magic, corpse refinement, spirit beasts, and escape techniques – all linked together, snatching the Soul Cleansing Liquid, almost costing Elder Ye his life.</p><p>As expected, a Nascent Soul master was not so easy to deal with.</p><p>Ming Wei, knowing the weight of her responsibility, immediately retreated, activating the Life Talisman, waiting for Qin Sang's return.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Seeing Ming Wei hadn't fled, Qin Sang felt relieved, a slight smile gracing his lips.</p><p>Then, a wave of emptiness washed over him.</p><p>Activating the nine-banner magic array had drained the little true energy he had just recovered with spirit pills. Fortunately, it was enough to unleash the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire; otherwise, he would have been forced to consume another drop of Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang arrive, Ming Wei couldn't hide her excitement, activating the Life Talisman.</p><p>The talisman glowed slightly, a complex ancient character representing 'life' appearing on its surface. Then, a gentle light formed an aura, enveloping them both.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang ordered the corpse to flee deep into the cave. Ming Wei also set some traps, and then they both disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>Deep in the cave, the corpse and puppets created chaos; various auras mixed in the tunnels, making identification impossible.</p><p>Elder Ye stood at the entrance, searching to no avail.</p><p>Just then, the long-bearded elder and the others finally caught up.</p><p>Unsure of what had happened, they looked at Elder Ye, hesitant to speak.</p><p>Noticing their master's expression, they grew increasingly uneasy.  Their master had destroyed a precious artifact to forcibly break the seal, yet failed to capture the opponent?  Three bottles of Soul-Washing Liquid, simply snatched away before their eyes?</p><p>"Master, what do we do now?" the elder with a long beard whispered, gesturing to those behind him, a hint of worry in his eyes.</p><p>The cultivators in the cavern were all shrewd individuals.  Initially, they were shocked by the grim fate of Xue Fu and the others, afraid to contend with a Yuan Ying cultivator.  But when Qin Sang made his move, the situation changed instantly, leaving them too stunned to react before it was over.</p><p>Now, they were beginning to understand.  In this trial realm, a Yuan Ying ancestor wasn't as fearsome as they'd thought.</p><p>Currently, three bottles of Soul-Washing Liquid had been taken by Qin Sang, their whereabouts unknown, but one remained, in the possession of the alluring woman.</p><p>Malevolent gazes fell upon the alluring woman and her companions.  The crowd, growing restless, slowly surrounded them, their figures casting shadows in the cavern.</p><p>Sacrificing one bottle of Soul-Washing Liquid was a decision made by Qin Sang and Bai.  If necessary, they were prepared to sacrifice another.  Helping them escape was only one part of the plan.</p><p>If all four bottles had been taken by Qin Sang, the others would have had no reason to fight.  Other cultivators, seeing no opportunity, even if they discovered Ye Zunzhe's true identity, would not dare to press the matter further. They might even unite against Qin Sang, joining in the hunt for him.</p><p>However, if Ye Zunzhe relentlessly pursued them and discovered something, the consequences would be dire.</p><p>By sacrificing one bottle, Ye Zunzhe and his group now became the target of everyone's ire. Driving away Ye Zunzhe, their main enemy, would greatly increase Qin Sang's safety—a worthwhile trade.</p><p>"Give me the Soul-Washing Liquid," Ye Zunzhe demanded of the alluring woman.</p><p>The alluring woman bit her lip, reluctant, but upon meeting Ye Zunzhe's gaze, she flinched and hastily handed over the liquid.</p><p>"Go!" Ye Zunzhe said, glancing back with icy eyes that made the surrounding cultivators recoil.</p><p>"Master, are we just giving up?"  A strong man grumbled, resentful. The Soul-Washing Liquid was crucial for forming a Nascent Soul, a once-in-a-century opportunity!</p><p>"Humph! The methods that man employed were far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary cultivator.  His plan was meticulously crafted; if I hadn't been there, the Soul-Washing Liquid would have all been his. These secret techniques couldn't have been created out of thin air. We will mobilize the Merchant's League. Finding his identity won't be difficult, and then he will pay dearly!" Ye Zunzhe said coldly, disappearing into a corridor.</p><p>Su Nu was secretly curious about how Qin Sang had escaped pursuit. Her tense nerves finally relaxed.</p>
