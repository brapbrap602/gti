<h1>Chapter 1695: The Summon</h1><p>“His spirit fire possesses the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Aren't you tempted, old monk?” the Qinghu Saint King countered.</p><p>“While I was unable to focus my attention and didn't sense the aura of the spirit fire at the time, from their descriptions, it sounds like a demonic flame, doesn't it?”  慧光 Saint responded, instantly seeing through the Qinghu Saint King's intentions.</p><p>The formula for the Soul-Calming Incense and the Nanming Li fire were both things she desperately wanted.  It was just unfortunate that Qin Sang possessed these treasures.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King fell silent.</p><p>慧光 Saint did not press further, but cautioned, “Unless this fire can be refined by the Saint King, greatly enhancing cultivation and abilities, if it’s merely for an additional means of defense, its power is too volatile and difficult to control. Recklessly using it in the Gui Xu could cause severe disturbances, attracting a swarm of beasts and placing us in even greater danger.  This person is already like a startled bird; force is not an option.  Saint King, heed my words, and don't act rashly and create further complications.”</p><p>The East Sea's Gui Xu is rife with ferocious beasts.</p><p>Even before the Heavenly Demon's Sound caused the beasts to riot, Gui Xu was an extremely dangerous place.  Even Nascent Soul cultivators would only venture there after exhausting all other options and making thorough preparations.</p><p>Now that the beasts have been driven mad by the demonic sound, who knows what the situation within their lairs is like.</p><p>In the East Sea Ascension, ferocious beasts are one of the greatest threats.</p><p>Especially within Gui Xu, they might be able to handle a single beast, but if they clash directly, the resulting disturbance could attract even more.</p><p>“If I can subdue the spirit and control this treasure, I wouldn't need to pursue anything else,” the Qinghu Saint King glanced at the Five Elements Crown atop the demonic body, her tone softening.</p><p>Of course, she also understood that after this failure, recapturing that person would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Unless she and the old monk personally intervened, anyone else who tried would be courting death.</p><p>If there’s even the slightest disturbance, and that person senses danger and hides or escapes Zhongzhou and seeks refuge in the storm belt, would they forgo ascension and remain in Zhongzhou until they find him?</p><p>The old monk is a local expert; finding that person would require the Buddhist sect's assistance.</p><p>The most pressing matter now is to help suppress the demonic body's frenzy, restore some of its sanity, extract secrets, and at the same time verify some previous theories and investigate the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Several monks charged towards the broken mountain.</p><p>The five-colored clouds revealed other colored lights, indicating that the Five Elements Divine Restriction hadn't yet destroyed all the formations on the mountain. They were tasked with rescuing the remaining treasures of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Other Buddhist experts also scattered, occupying key locations within the legacy estate, driving away outsiders.</p><p>Unfortunately, manpower was insufficient, and with unforeseen circumstances arising, those people scattered as soon as the demonic body showed signs of defeat.  The estate's passages continued to expand, now covering nearly half of the Taiyue mountain range, and the estate is about to reappear in the world.  慧光 Saint’s plan to capture everyone is impossible, so they can only secure control of the estate first.</p><p>Above.</p><p>The Poison King emerged from his gray cocoon, having narrowly escaped death, surveying the mountains of the legacy estate, his eyes flickering.</p><p>A while ago, the Poison King learned from Yue Lingtian about what transpired while he was trapped; he felt both relief and anxiety.</p><p>He was relieved that he had previously leaned towards a trade, not creating a deadly feud with that person.  His anxiety stemmed from the fact that the Gu King was in that person's hands; how could he retrieve it?</p><p>Mo Xingdao regulated his breath while observing the Qinghu Saint King and 慧光 Saint, then glancing at others.  He silently retreated, but suddenly heard a voice transmission, freezing in place.</p><p>…</p><p>“My injuries prevent me from rising to greet you.  Please forgive the discourtesy.”</p><p>In a crude stone mansion carved into a remote corner of the barren mountain, Qin Sang stopped his recovery and looked at Liuli, who entered, a faint smile appearing on his pale face.</p><p>It was evident that smiling was difficult for him; he had to strain his facial muscles.</p><p>His avatar sent Liuli and hastily left.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "My avatar previously disguised itself as the ancestor of the Xie family of Pushan. This time, my identity was exposed, attracting a Demon Saint King; this may bring disaster to the Xie family. I have several friends still in Pushan; they don't know about the changes here. I need to warn them as quickly as possible so that they can make preparations.”</p><p>Before rumors spread, the fastest way was through the Six States Hall; whether it’s in time or not remains uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang could only do his best and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>With the Ghost Mother present, things should be handled properly.</p><p>Liuli slightly nodded, seeing that Qin Sang's injuries were severe. "What are your plans afterward?"</p><p>“Naturally, I will first find a place to recover…”</p><p>Qin Sang twitched his lips, but this aggravated his internal injuries, almost causing him to gasp in pain.</p><p>He managed to keep smiling, gazing at Liuli.  She wore monastic robes, a monk's hat concealing most of her hair, yet a few strands of dark hair were visible beneath the brim.  Her lay attire didn't hide her exceptional beauty; instead, it enhanced her elegance and serenity, softening her usually aloof demeanor.  She seemed less distant.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surprising wave of relief.  Years ago, Liuli had cut her hair, a decisive act that marked her departure. He had thought he'd never see her again.  Seeing her familiar face, he blurted out, "Thank goodness you didn't actually become a nun."</p><p>Liuli remained silent, her gaze cold.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly fell silent, forcing a nervous laugh.  Given his current state, it was best not to push his luck; Liuli could easily eliminate him with a single blow.</p><p>He then noticed that, while still in the mid-Yuan Ying stage, Liuli's aura was nearly as powerful as a fully realized Yuan Ying cultivator. She was at the peak of her current realm.</p><p>"Your cultivation..." he murmured.</p><p>Realizing Liuli could still sense him, he knew the lingering effects of the demonic technique hadn't been resolved. Was she facing another bottleneck?  His worry grew.</p><p>Liuli said calmly, "When the Legacy Palace appeared, I sensed a breakthrough opportunity and intended to enter seclusion."</p><p>Guessing what Qin Sang wanted to ask, she paused, looked at him, and said, "You can suppress the mark."</p><p>They had both cultivated the *Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing*.  Qin Sang held the dominant position.  Though she tried her best to suppress the mark, he could easily undo her efforts and uncover its secrets if he wished.</p><p>The fact that he hadn't suggests he had never considered doing so. Even during the confrontation with Yin Changsheng in the Sacred Land, when she willingly opened her mind, Qin Sang merely borrowed her essence to control the Sun God Tree, immediately severing the connection without lingering thoughts or actions.</p><p>"We still need to find a way to remove the mark," Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>From Liuli's tone, her Buddhist practice had made progress, but it wasn't enough to fully eliminate the threat.</p><p>Speaking of breakthroughs, Qin Sang retrieved a jade orb from his Qian Jun ring and offered it to Liuli.  About the size of a baby's fist, it emitted a pure, vibrant green light, like a night pearl.  It was full of tiny, nested cavities, though some sections appeared incomplete.  It was the Celestial Linglong Embryo.</p><p>Liuli didn't take it, but her gaze was captivated.  She sensed it was no ordinary object.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "This is called the Celestial Linglong. I obtained it from an opponent.  It's a treasure created by the Wood Affinity lineage, aiding in the breakthrough to the Transcendence stage.  For advancement to Transcendence, the attunement with Heaven is vital, directly related to one's spiritual roots… As you know, I have five spiritual roots, so it's useless to me. I don't lack breakthrough aids, so I intended to trade it with Mo Xingdao, exchanging it for a Spiritual Insight Fruit, assuming he can free himself."</p><p>Qin Sang then produced a wooden box, revealing a glowing green sphere containing the Celestial Linglong's cultivation techniques.</p><p>Liuli examined its contents with her divine sense, her expression changing. After a moment of silence, she shook her head.  "It's merely a small task for me."</p><p>Her personality hadn't changed!  Despite his explanations, he couldn't persuade her.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  "It might be a small task for you, but it's a life-saving grace for me. Moreover, you took a great risk. You practice Buddhism; shouldn't you know that your relentless vigilance is attachment?  Letting nature take its course is the righteous path."</p><p>Liuli remained firm, only copying the contents of the sphere.  "I haven't even reached the late Yuan Ying stage. I have plenty of time to gather resources and refine a Celestial Linglong.  Since Moon Laurel Celestial Dew has appeared in the Central Plains before, it hasn't completely disappeared; it might still be found."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak, then simply put the Celestial Linglong Embryo away.</p><p>"Very well, I'll keep it for you. I also have a Spirit-Subduing Incense stick left. If you need it, just ask."</p><p>Liuli remained noncommittal.</p><p>Qin Sang changed the subject, "What faction have you joined? Will today's events have negative consequences?"</p><p>The exposure of the transmission channel would also expose the faction's connection to the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  Any repercussions could lead to the sect blaming Liuli.</p><p>"The Yan Yue Temple. Our founding ancestor was married to an elder of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. After the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's destruction, its disciples secluded themselves, using other identities when traveling in the world..."  Liuli gave a brief explanation of the Yan Yue Temple's origins.</p><p>Having learned that the Yanyue Nunnery's founder was from the Water Phase lineage, and also had deep roots in the Gold Phase lineage, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  She quickly produced several items:</p><p>Jade scrolls obtained from Bingyi Palace, recording the Water Phase lineage's  "Taiyi Hidden Water," "Lightless Shield," "Yuanji Divine Wheel," and "Smoke-Mist Shadowless Illusion Body" techniques.</p><p>Also, the gold sword acquired from Disu Mountain, containing the Gold Phase lineage's sword array inheritance.</p><p>Qin Sang handed everything to Liuli, leaving the arrangements to her.</p><p>After glancing over the contents of the scrolls and sword, Liuli looked at Qin Sang again, surprised by the richness of her gains from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. This time, Liuli didn't refuse.</p><p>She feigned a return to the secret hall to retrieve treasures, actually intending to rescue Qin Sang.  The old nun saw through her deception, but instead of anger, offered assistance. Ultimately, they failed to retrieve the treasures from the secret hall.</p><p>This favor must be repaid.  Returning the inheritances of both lineages would be a suitable recompense.  Perhaps due to their long separation, a certain awkwardness lingered.  After discussing these matters, Qin Sang found herself at a loss for words, and Liuli, naturally reserved, didn't initiate conversation either.  The cave dwelling fell silent, filled with unspoken understanding.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang glanced outside, "My clone should be nearing the nearby Liuzhou Hall soon.  Immortal, do you know who's currently at the Xie family residence?"</p><p>Not expecting Liuli to offer assistance, Qin Sang answered herself, "I originally went north to Jinyu State to attend the Ullambana Festival, but unexpectedly met Elder Gui Mu there.  I was able to arrive at the relic mansion before its emergence, thanks to her guidance. My original intention was to go to the Central State Immortal Hall, but the path was blocked. Judging from Eight Scenery Purple Thunder Realperson's actions, she must have ascended to the upper realm."</p><p>Hearing "Gui Mu," Liuli's eyes flickered, "Ya Gu?"</p><p>Finally, a response!  It was commendable that she still remembered Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted, and she smiled, "My previous efforts weren't in vain. Elder Gui Mu checked, and Ya Gu's condition is well-preserved. Elder Gui Mu is currently helping her, and she'll certainly be able to undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and awaken her."</p><p>Touched by Qin Sang's smile, Liuli's expression softened, and she softly said, "Congratulations."</p><p>Qin Sang knew she was remembering her master.  In a way, they were both bound by their obsessions. His obsession was about to be resolved, while Liuli and her master remained separated across realms, a prospect seemingly hopeless.</p><p>"Immortal, rest assured, your master is blessed, and will surely overcome this danger.  Through encountering Elder Gui Mu, I learned many secrets…"</p><p>Qin Sang spoke rapidly, relaying everything she'd learned from Elder Gui Mu.</p><p>"The Ascension Platform leads to the Demon Realm, but the Immortal Hall and Ascension Platform are likely not connected… The Immortal Hall ascension was a grand spectacle. Unless someone in the upper realm orchestrated a cover-up, news would certainly have spread. Elder Gui Mu is preparing for her own ascension. I'll ask her to investigate upon her arrival in the upper realm, perhaps obtaining news of your master, and hopefully offering assistance. After our own ascension, we'll visit Elder Gui Mu in the Witch Clan."</p><p>"Ascension…"</p><p>Liuli seemed lost in thought, yet a glimmer of anticipation shone in her eyes.  This anticipation was the driving force behind her relentless efforts.</p><p>With her clone's prolonged absence, Qin Sang didn't intend to wait any longer, suggesting they depart and boldly requesting protection, "One person for two tasks, Immortal, would you be willing to escort me once more?"</p><p>Upon learning that the Qiling Cave Master also died at Qin Sang's hands, Liuli was speechless.</p><p>How could this person have so many enemies, so soon after arriving in Central State?</p><p>The Qiling Cave Master was infamous in the Southern Barbarian Two States. His mastery of ghost arts made him unpredictable and terrifying.  Those targeted by him often didn’t even know how they died; more often, death itself was a luxury. Even sects like Wan Du Mountain and Tai Yue Gate avoided provoking such a formidable foe.</p><p>After reaching his peak cultivation, he rarely appeared, yet his notoriety persisted.  To think he died here, silently, without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to visit the Qiling Cave Master's cave dwelling—not the overt one, of course. This person was cunning, with several hidden retreats.  His medicinal garden was located in the most secretive abode, its precise location unknown even to his disciples.  Perhaps he could find medicinal herbs there to aid his recovery.</p><p>He could recuperate in the Qiling Cave Master's cave dwelling for a while, but being too close to the Poison King wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>After taking some pills, Qin Sang could barely move.  The Qiling Cave Master's cave dwelling was located in an uninhabited area of Man State. The two headed southwest. The Southern Barbarian Two States were rife with poisonous miasma, sparsely populated, lessening the risk of exposure.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang recounted her experiences over the years, learning that Liuli had initially sought a Buddhist temple in the Western Desert for quiet cultivation, unexpectedly encountering the Yanyue Nunnery's abbess who was traveling there. They toured the Western Desert together, forming a friendship, and Liuli accepted the abbess's invitation to join the nunnery.  Following the abbess's advice, she chose to practice with her hair unbound and remained within the nunnery ever since.</p>
