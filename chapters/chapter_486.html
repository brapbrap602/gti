<h1>Chapter 479: The Harvest</h1><p>“Soul Refining Devil Device?”</p><p>The yellow-armored man sized up the Ten Yama Pennant with an intrigued look. “As far as I know, the Shadowless Sword originates from the righteous Shaohua Mountain Sect. In the Small Cold Realm, the righteous and demonic sects are diametrically opposed, and the righteous sects all put on a sanctimonious air.  I never expected the renowned Shadowless Sword of Shaohua Mountain to be used to create so many Soul Refining Devil Devices. I wonder how many lives have been taken.  If word gets out, it's bound to cause a huge uproar. I wonder if Shaohua Mountain would be willing to cleanse its own ranks.”</p><p>“Then let's not let word get out,” Qin Sang replied indifferently, ignoring the yellow-armored man’s threat.</p><p>‘Clatter…’</p><p>The flag formation roared, and an endless stream of ghostfire surged forth.</p><p>The entire formation, including Qin Sang, was engulfed in flames.</p><p>The fire soared into the sky.</p><p>The Mountain Suppressing Stele emitted a low humming sound.</p><p>The lower half of the giant stele was surrounded by ghostfire.  Mysterious yellow energy emanated continuously from the stele, but it seemed somewhat powerless against the aggressive ghostfire.</p><p>The mysterious yellow energy could only hold its ground around the stele, but it was still being steadily consumed by the ghostfire.</p><p>The power of the Ten Yama Pennant was greater than that of the talisman treasure, which is why it could so easily block the sneak attack of the Mountain Shaking Stele.  Its counterattack was naturally also extremely fierce.</p><p>The Mountain Shaking Stele was no match for the Ten Yama Pennant, but it wouldn't be completely destroyed either.</p><p>Seeing this, the yellow-armored man's expression became grave, and he snorted coldly, "I admit that this set of Soul Refining Devil Devices of yours is indeed extraordinary, but I wonder how long it can last in battle."</p><p>He could naturally see that the consumption of the Ten Yama Pennant was definitely not small, especially during intense combat. If the user's spiritual power was exhausted first, the power of the magic weapon would be useless.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was not yet at the Pseudo Core Formation realm, one level lower than his own. Moreover, he was confident in his unique armor, so he wasn't afraid of the Ten Yama Pennant at all.</p><p>“Fall!”</p><p>The yellow-armored man roared, unleashing the full power of the talisman treasure.</p><p>The inscriptions on the Mountain Shaking Stele lit up with a mysterious yellow light. Its weight suddenly increased several times, forcing down the ghostfire and slowly descending.</p><p>Where the ghostfire and the Mountain Shaking Stele met, there was a rumbling sound like thunder.</p><p>Clusters of ghostfire were extinguished.</p><p>On the other hand, the situation of the Mountain Shaking Stele was even worse.  Cracks began to appear on its base, starting as a thin line and rapidly spreading like a spiderweb across the lower half of the stele as it descended.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>With a crisp sound, a corner of the Mountain Shaking Stele finally broke off, and a large piece fell down, immediately disappearing, perhaps swallowed by the ghostfire.</p><p>The yellow-armored man appeared indifferent as he unleashed the power of the talisman treasure without reservation.</p><p>Accompanied by cracking sounds, the Mountain Shaking Stele disintegrated faster and faster, as if being devoured by ghostfire, disappearing layer by layer at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Finally, only half of the Mountain Suppressing Stele remained, and it was covered in cracks.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Mountain Shaking Stele suddenly exploded.</p><p>A strong gale erupted, pushing the ghostfire back. At this moment, an intense mysterious yellow light suddenly surged from the yellow-armored man's armor.</p><p>The originally separated pieces of armor merged into one seamless piece under the yellow light, including the yellow-armored man’s face.</p><p>The yellow-armored man transformed into a true warrior.</p><p>He raised his hands high, and the light from his armor frantically gathered in his palms, eventually condensing into a majestic halberd.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>With the halberd in hand, the yellow-armored man swung it casually and easily chipped off a corner of the black stone.</p><p>In the next instant, he vanished from his original spot and appeared above the Mountain Shaking Stele, just as it exploded. Under the cover of the gale, his figure spun rapidly.</p><p>Man and halberd descended like a meteor, fiercely stabbing towards the sea of fire.</p><p>The yellow-armored man didn't know that, as he detonated the Mountain Suppressing Stele, within the depths of the sea of fire, a flame even more profound and pure than ghostfire was quietly emerging.</p><p>Nine Nether Demon Flame!</p><p>Within the Ten Yama Formation, the ten main souls jointly held the Ten Yama Pennant, and Qin Sang forced out his blood essence, secretly activating the magic treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang had long since made up his mind that he absolutely could not let the yellow-armored man escape!</p><p>With the numerous restrictions in this place, if he couldn’t achieve a quick victory, the yellow-armored man could easily find an opportunity to escape.  Therefore, Qin Sang unhesitatingly used the Ten Yama Pennant magic treasure.</p><p>He considered the yellow-armored man a formidable opponent and had long learned that the man excelled in close combat, rendering opponents helpless with his powerful armor and combat skills.</p><p>This was the moment!</p><p>The magic treasure not only devoured Qin Sang's blood essence, but also, like a bottomless pit, rapidly consumed his spiritual power.</p><p>A stream of Nine Nether Demon Flame surged from the magic treasure and then, following Qin Sang’s will, transformed into the shape of a black sword, shooting upwards like an arrow leaving the string.</p><p>At this moment, the golden-armored man flew down, stabbing.  Sensing an unusually sharp aura within the sea of fire, seemingly extraordinary, he wasn't afraid but instead sneered, "I knew you had an unusual spirit sword!"</p><p>“Black Magnetic Sand!”</p><p>He held the halberd with one hand and suddenly threw out a handful of gray sand with the other.</p><p>Black Magnetic Sand was a peculiar substance developed by the Skywalking Alliance's refining masters. It was particularly effective against spirit weapons like flying swords and daggers. The heavy Black Magnetic Sand would adhere to flying swords, making them extremely cumbersome and greatly reducing their power.</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Flame burst out of the sea of fire.</p><p>A scene that shocked the yellow-armored man unfolded. Not only did the Black Magnetic Sand fail to adhere to the black sword, it was directly devoured by it.</p><p>This was no sword; it was clearly a terrifying flame!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Flame revealed its true form, and a terrifying aura swept out. Qin Sang stopped concealing it and dispersed the ghostfire.</p><p>On the ground, among the flag formation, the unusually tall Ten Yama Pennant made the yellow-armored man's hair stand on end.</p><p>“A magic treasure!”</p><p>The yellow-armored man cried out in terror, desperately trying to stop and then flee upwards, but it was too late.  The Nine Nether Demon Flame had already arrived, engulfing him.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>No matter how formidable the yellow-armored man’s armor was, it couldn't withstand the Nine Nether Demon Flame. It visibly turned into a lump of scrap metal, swallowed by the demonic fire.</p><p>Having lost his armor, the yellow-armored man was like someone streaking naked in public, facing the Nine Nether Demon Flame alone.</p><p>The terrifying flames were close at hand.</p><p>The yellow-armored man desperately circulated his spiritual power, but it was to no avail. The aura of death filled him with despair.</p><p>Even more terrifying, he sensed an aura within the Nine Nether Demon Flame that could assault his Nascent Soul.  Because of this aura, the yellow-armored man felt his thoughts slowing down. Instinctively, he tried to retrieve another magic weapon, but his movements were too slow, and he failed.</p><p>My life is over!</p><p>The yellow-armored man closed his eyes in despair, his Nascent Soul severely injured, and he fell unconscious.</p><p>At the last moment, Qin Sang suddenly formed a hand seal, stopping the Nine Nether Demon Flame and preventing it from completely consuming the yellow-armored man.</p><p>He flashed over to the yellow-armored man's side, and seeing that he was still alive, his face lit up with joy.  He cast several restrictions to seal the man's cultivation and then stuffed a few healing pills into his mouth.</p><p>Finally, he had captured a Pseudo Core Formation cultivator with his own power, and unlike the handsome young man, he could take this one out without worry.</p>
