<h1>Chapter 1103: The Demon-Binding Chain</h1><p>"It seems that the descendants of that ancient creature have been hiding in the magma all this time, unable to leave the ancient cultivator's ruins. They’ve managed to survive undetected until now. However, after so many years, they’re still stuck at the peak of the second transformation. The difficulty of these strange insects evolving is truly as legendary as they say..."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p><p>At that moment, small ripples appeared in the magma, and a crimson shadow shot out like an arrow from a bow, lunging toward the jade plate.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered.</p><p>By the time the Fire Jade Centipede realized something was wrong, it was already too late.</p><p>With effortless ease, Qin Sang captured it, reclaiming the strange insect he had lost!</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's size hadn't changed much since its first transformation, but its entire body was now a deep crimson, its luster more profound, resembling a long piece of fiery jade.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede spread its hundred legs, summoning flames as it struggled in Qin Sang's grasp. However, it was powerless to break free from the restrictions Qin Sang had placed upon it.</p><p>"This creature has reached the second transformation, but it doesn’t seem to have developed any powerful abilities. Could it still only be useful for treasure hunting?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, amused by the Fire Jade Centipede's pitiful struggles. With a smile, he summoned the jade plate back to his hand and guided a stream of Crimson Fire Gold to the centipede's mouth.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede froze for a moment, then unceremoniously swallowed the Crimson Fire Gold, showing no gratitude toward Qin Sang before resuming its futile resistance.</p><p>"Stubborn thing! Its intelligence is low, far inferior to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, and even further behind the Fat Silkworm."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>If he wanted to imprint his spiritual mark on it, he would have to wait until it transformed and laid eggs.</p><p>However, given the vast difference in their cultivation levels, Qin Sang used several secret techniques from the Witch Clan and the Beast Taming Sect to forcefully suppress the Fire Jade Centipede's resistance.</p><p>After some time of taming, he finally managed to make the Fire Jade Centipede somewhat obedient.</p><p>"I'll leave the remaining Crimson Fire Gold for it. Perhaps it can help it transform."</p><p>Having unexpectedly acquired a third strange insect, Qin Sang was in high spirits, feeling that this trip had been well worth it.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had lived in the ancient cultivator's ruins for many years and was very familiar with the area.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Fire Jade Centipede to lead the way. With the protection of the Turtle Shell Profound Water, he dove into the magma and successfully found a passage through the ancient restrictions, allowing him to infiltrate the depths of Tianfeng Mountain.</p><p>The further he went, the more Qin Sang realized just how severely the interior had been damaged. If not for the Fire Jade Centipede guiding him, he would likely have returned empty-handed.</p><p>Revisiting the place, Qin Sang saw that the ancient restrictions inside Tianfeng Mountain had also been heavily damaged, and the number of firebirds was far fewer than before.</p><p>Fortunately, the remaining restrictions were still relatively stable and hadn’t been completely destroyed.</p><p>Unfazed by the firebirds, Qin Sang released his divine sense and conducted a thorough search.</p><p>From the mountain's entrance all the way to its base, he found no trace of the spiritual talisman he was seeking.</p><p>"Just as I thought," Qin Sang sighed softly. "Back then, Daoist Xuanyu was just trying to lure me out... The Inner Realm Talisman was most likely destroyed along with Daoist Xuanyu's death."</p><p>His gaze swept downward, and he noticed that the stone platform and stone hall were still intact.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly narrowed in surprise. The restrictions on the stone hall, which Daoist Xuanyu had exhausted all his strength to try and open, had now dimmed.</p><p>It was unclear whether the restrictions had been damaged due to some unforeseen event or if someone had visited the place and opened the stone hall.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed, and he landed on the stone platform.</p><p>The restrictions had already been destroyed. With a wave of his hand, a giant palm formed from his true essence easily moved the stone platform aside.</p><p>The interior was unexpectedly simple.</p><p>The space inside the stone hall was very low, giving off an oppressive feeling. There was no altar or treasure vault as one might expect.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to conclude that the place had already been looted, he made an unexpected discovery: in the corner of the space lay a black iron chain.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Bai suddenly emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag and went over to pick up the iron chain.</p><p>When Qin Sang got a clear look at the chain, he felt a sense of familiarity and couldn't help but show a look of astonishment.</p><p>This iron chain was strikingly similar to the one they had seen in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion of the Trial Realm not long ago, except this one was much longer.</p><p>But what surprised Qin Sang wasn’t just that.</p><p>The two exchanged a glance.</p><p>Bai handed the chain over.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense and probed it slightly.</p><p>The chain was clearly a treasure forged by ancient cultivators, and the ancient restrictions and fluctuations within it were identical to those of the Black Iron Pillar used to refine the Demon Banner!</p><p>However, the restrictions inside the Black Iron Pillar were far more complex and profound, far beyond what this chain could compare to.</p><p>When Patriarch Kuiyin discovered it, the Black Iron Pillar had already been broken into two pieces, but this chain was likely intact.</p><p>"That chain in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion was isolated by a light barrier, and you felt a sense of familiarity with it. Can you recall its origins now?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and asked.</p><p>Bai said in a deep voice, "The chain in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion was probably not the real thing, but a replica made by later generations. This chain should be called the Demon-Binding Chain. I only remember that it was specifically forged to restrain ancient demons..."</p><p>"The Demon-Binding Chain! To restrain ancient demons!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>That Black Iron Pillar was valued by Patriarch Kuiyin precisely because it could suppress the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Could these two be part of the same category of treasures?</p><p>"Do you remember if there are other treasures similar to the Demon-Binding Chain?"</p><p>Qin Sang pressed eagerly.</p><p>Bai shook his head. "I can't recall, but there must be. The power of this Demon-Binding Chain is limited and can't be used against high-level ancient demons... I remember that such treasures require corresponding formations to unleash their full potential, but I can't recall how to set up the formation."</p><p>As he spoke, Bai looked down at the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed the extremely complex runes carved into the floor.</p><p>But the formation's power had long since dissipated, and with only these remnants left, it was impossible to restore it.</p><p>"Could this place also be a prison for ancient demons? There’s no sign of the demon, so I wonder if it escaped or perished in the endless passage of time."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around.</p><p>"The Demon-Suppressing Stele of Yitian Peak restrains the Demon Lord, Patriarch Kuiyin discovered the Black Iron Pillar in the Purple Palace, and now there’s the Demon-Binding Chain here. Could they all be part of the same category of treasures designed to suppress ancient demons?"</p><p>The high-level ancient demons Bai mentioned must have cultivation levels surpassing those of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>It was unclear what level of ancient demon the Demon-Binding Chain was meant to deal with. Unfortunately, without the corresponding formation, they couldn’t activate this treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a Demon Banner and summoned the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>The demon fire shrank slightly in the presence of the Demon-Binding Chain, but not as noticeably as it had with the Black Iron Pillar.</p><p>The replica of the Demon-Binding Chain in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion was likely something the Four Saints had learned about and tried to replicate in an attempt to restrain ancient demons. When they found it ineffective, they discarded it in the Trial Realm.</p><p>"Let’s record these runes first. When you have time, study them. Perhaps you can restore the formation. The Sin Abyss seems to have traces of demonic activity as well. If we had a complete Demon-Binding Chain, dealing with them would be much easier..."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade slip and began copying the runes on the ground.</p><p>At the same time, he thought of the Black Iron Pillar.</p><p>Once he refined the Nine Nether Demon Fire into a Fire Lotus, the Black Iron Pillar would no longer be of use.</p><p>If he could repair this treasure and obtain the corresponding formation method, it would give him another powerful tool to suppress ancient demons.</p><p>"Patriarch Kuiyin used half of the Black Iron Pillar to forge the Ten Directions Yama Banners. I’ve only obtained three of them, and the other seven are scattered who knows where. I’ll need to find them all before I can even think about repairing it."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p>
