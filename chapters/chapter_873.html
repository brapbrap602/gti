<h1>Chapter 865:  The Thunder Control Technique</h1><p>Uninvited guests were rapidly approaching.</p><p>These individuals made no attempt to hide their intentions, brazenly charging towards them, causing Qin Sang and the others to feel a surge of suspicion.  However, they were already committed to their course of action.</p><p>The Imprisoning Cage array intensified, unleashing the full force of its chilling winds. The frigid air, sharp as blades, ravaged the Kui Dragon.</p><p>The Kui Dragon's scales, forming a protective lightning-cloak, were in tatters. Its roars, once powerful, were now weakened, stifled by the icy winds and relentless attacks.  Several times it tried to rise, but failed, only to sustain further injuries.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang urged them on repeatedly. The group held nothing back, knowing they had to critically wound the Kui Dragon before the uninvited guests arrived, preventing them from being overwhelmed by both cultivators and the beast and allowing them to focus their efforts on the newcomers.</p><p>The Imprisoning Cage array was pushed to its limits.  Columns of icy air spiraled inward, slowly pressing down. The pale, ethereal mass seemed to weigh a thousand tons, pinning the Kui Dragon to the ground.</p><p>The torrential rain that fell here instantly froze into icicles, the ground already covered with a thick layer of ice shards.</p><p>The Kui Dragon's wails mingled with the thunder, echoing far into the distance. Cultivators rushing to the scene heard the beast's cries, their hearts wrenched with pain.</p><p>Gale-force winds whipped up enormous waves.</p><p>The rain poured down relentlessly.</p><p>A thunder god lurked within the dark clouds, drumming the rhythm of the battle.</p><p>Those cultivators, braving the wind, rain, and lightning, were rapidly approaching.  They finally saw the Kui Dragon trapped within the array.</p><p>The once majestic spirit beast was now utterly miserable.</p><p>Chains of ice bound it to the ground, where it lay curled up, enduring the assault.</p><p>Its scales were falling off, its flesh torn and bloody, its mud-caked body covered in a mixture of blood and ice.  Countless sword and whip marks marred its body. Its aura was weaker than ever before.</p><p>The Kui Dragon roared, its voice hoarse.  Seeing familiar faces approaching, hope flickered in its eyes, and it struggled fiercely.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“Release it!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>…</p><p>Witnessing this scene, these cultivators were beside themselves with rage, their shouts echoing as they commanded Qin Sang and the others to release the Kui Dragon.</p><p>This was the crucial moment, however.  Qin Sang and his companions naturally ignored the shouts, seizing the opportunity to continue their assault.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang glanced in the direction of the approaching figures, his eyes flashing. He darted forward to meet them, conjuring a hundred-zhang-long water sword with a flick of his hand, pointing it at the newcomers and issuing a stern warning: “We are hunting demons here.  Leave now, or face the consequences!”</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>The newcomers were enraged.  “The Kui Dragon isn’t a demon beast; it’s our sect’s spirit beast! You are killing our sect’s spirit beast and threatening us. How audacious!”</p><p>A spirit beast?</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang and the others were stunned, exchanging surprised glances.</p><p>Kui Dragons of this strength were rare, and few cultivators could subdue them.  Judging by the enraged expressions of these people, could it be their guardian spirit beast?</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang scoffed, “You say the Kui Dragon is yours, does that make it true? This area is known for its depleted spiritual energy.  Where would a sect suddenly appear from? This demon has been stirring up trouble here, breathing out mist and causing storms, repeatedly attacking passing caravans. Such an evil beast deserves to die, yet no one has ever come to restrain it! Your sweet talk is merely a pretext to covet the Kui Dragon’s treasures. Don’t try to deceive me; kill it!”</p><p>The last sentence was addressed to Qin Sang and his group.</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions were filled with doubts, unsure who was telling the truth.</p><p>However, the young man surnamed Fang's words made sense.  These people were capable of anything for treasure; posing as the owner of a demon beast was perfectly plausible.</p><p>Their apparent rage might well be a pretense.</p><p>The treasures on the Kui Dragon were enough to tempt these people to take such risks.</p><p>The situation was unclear.</p><p>But they had expended so much effort hunting the Kui Dragon; they couldn't simply let it go.</p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p>The newcomers were practically beside themselves with anger, launching into a furious tirade.  “After being subdued by my master, the Kui Dragon has always been docile and never harmed anyone…”</p><p>Their shouting proved futile.</p><p>The icy air from the Imprisoning Cage array pressed down relentlessly, the Kui Dragon only able to crawl on the ground, its moans barely audible.</p><p>“You’re asking for death!”</p><p>The newcomers flew closer, clearly seeing the Kui Dragon’s state, their fury reaching a fever pitch. The leading man in green robes was completely enraged by the Kui Dragon’s plight.  His eyes were bloodshot, as he roared, “Thunder Control Technique!”</p><p>His fellow disciples, unable to contain themselves any longer, shifted their positions rapidly mid-flight, surrounding the man in green, before suddenly stopping.</p><p>This maneuver was unexpected.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang's expression changed slightly. He secretly mobilized his inner energy, holding a talisman, but remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the group, noticing they were levitating beneath a dark cloud, hands forming strange seals pointed towards the sky.  A feeling of unease settled over him, causing him to frown.</p><p>They weren't exceptionally powerful cultivators; only the middle-aged man was at the late Core Formation stage.  Their strength was inferior, and with the Heavenly Cold Gale Array, all they needed to do was eliminate the Kuilong to unleash its full power against their enemies. The array's power had been proven during the battle with the Kuilong.  Even if their opponents possessed some powerful technique, it shouldn't surpass the array's might.</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, but before he could react, an inexplicable fear washed over him, originating from the dark clouds above.  He looked up sharply, witnessing swirling clouds and a blinding flash of silver light – a massive concentration of lightning that had appeared silently.</p><p>"No!" Qin Sang exclaimed, his face pale with alarm.</p><p>The power surging from the lightning was terrifying. He wondered about the attackers’ origins and the nature of their technique—whether it was a magical spell or an array—which had accumulated such overwhelming power in an instant.  Countless bolts of lightning, drawn by some unseen force, converged above the islet.</p><p>A colossal ball of lightning formed with terrifying speed, its immense power about to erupt.  In Qin Sang's vision, the blinding light expanded explosively, descending upon them.  The entire sequence happened in a flash.</p><p>The others were equally horrified, unprepared for such a devastating attack.  There was no escape.  Someone shouted urgently, "Quick! Use the cold energy to block it!"</p><p>The others understood instantly.  Their focus had been entirely on the array; deploying other defenses was impossible.  The lightning was too fast and too powerful. Their only hope lay in diverting the Heavenly Cold Gale Array's cold energy to shield them, buying them time.  The Kuilong, trapped by the cold energy, was now a secondary concern.</p><p>"Activate!" Chu Heng roared.  Working together, they triggered another phase of the Heavenly Cold Gale Array.  The cold energy reversed course, surging upwards.</p><p>Instantly, lightning and cold energy clashed.  The resulting shockwave swept outwards, throwing the cultivators into disarray.</p>
