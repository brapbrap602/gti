<h1>Chapter 1715: The Dragon Whale Sage</h1><p>After several days of rest and recuperation in his secluded dwelling, he continued his routine, visiting the scripture library of the Ganlu Monastery, voraciously reading countless texts in search of enlightenment.  Some texts seemed unrelated to cultivation, yet contained profound wisdom, their true meaning only grasped at a higher level of understanding.  This is a process all high-level cultivators must undergo. Legend speaks of exceptionally gifted individuals who achieve enlightenment without needing to travel or rely on external treasures.</p><p>His public identity is Daoist Qingfeng, a newly ascended grand cultivator. The Ganlu Monastery has given him considerable freedom, and it would be unusual for him not to seize this opportunity.  Including the monastery's chief abbot, nobody suspects his true intentions, nor can they imagine that Qin Sang’s true form has already broken through to the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>He aims to find physical cultivation techniques similar to the *Seven-Master Buddha Seal* in the library, and also investigate the origin of the jade Buddha. The Ganlu Monastery is the leading Buddhist sect in this realm; if the answer isn't here, it might only be found in the Upper Realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, after thoroughly examining the Buddhist scriptures collected by the Ganlu Monastery, he found no Buddha or Bodhisattva corresponding to the jade Buddha.</p><p>Of course, a more important purpose of this incarnation's visit is to investigate the whereabouts of the Hui Guang Saint.</p><p>Lacking a suitable pretext to visit the Hui Guang Saint at Xiaofang Mountain, he adopted an indirect approach, proactively engaging other high monks in conversations and philosophical debates.</p><p>Through careful questioning and gathered information, he confirmed that the Hui Guang Saint's last appearance was seventy years ago. Seventy years ago, at the grand celebration marking the founding of the Three Teach Alliance, the Hui Guang Saint manifested their power, with the Qinghu Saint King in attendance, demonstrating their authority over the various sects.  Afterward, the Saint disappeared without a trace.</p><p>It is said that the Ganlu Monastery proactively ceded benefits within the alliance agreement, and even the Baxian Pavilion and Tianhao Tower, which had previously clashed with them, were able to work together harmoniously, thwarting any attempts at sowing discord.</p><p>During this time, some individuals mysteriously disappeared.  Other sects either acquiesced or joined, eliminating the need for the Saint to intervene.</p><p>After understanding the rules of the Three Teach Alliance, he concluded that, given the impossibility of another Nascent Soul cultivator emerging in this realm, unless a sect drastically declined, or irreconcilable conflicts arose between the three major sects, leading to the forceful dissolution of the alliance, it would be very difficult for the cultivation world to fall into chaos.</p><p>After this, the Ganlu Monastery showed no further unusual activity resembling the Hui Guang Saint’s style.</p><p>“Could they have left so hastily, already crossing the Eastern Sea to Gui Xu?”</p><p>Just as he was considering how to approach the Hui Guang Saint to confirm this, news arrived from the Eastern Sea.</p><p>The Eastern Sea's demon tribes were in turmoil!</p><p>…</p><p>In Central Plains, human cultivators are concentrated on land, leaving the Eastern Sea relatively weak. This is the result of a tacit understanding between the two races, with the demon tribe rarely encroaching, allowing for years of recovery and growth.</p><p>Legend says that during the decline of humanity, the Eastern Sea, North Sea, and South Sea were all demon territory.  Beasts roamed the coast, frequent beast tides sweeping towards the land, preying on humans, leaving none daring to venture into the sea.</p><p>Even today, the area controlled by humans is a tiny fraction, roughly divided into three zones based on island distribution. The outermost zone is undoubtedly the most perilous, bordering demon territory and rife with demonic beasts; only cultivators confident in their abilities dare to hunt there, and vice versa.  Neither side can be certain if they are hunter or prey, hence this area is also called the “Two-Race Hunting Ground.”</p><p>In the vast expanse of the sea to the east of the Northern Wasteland, a lone figure flies across the ocean's surface, unhurried and without concealment—an act of reckless self-destruction. This is deep within the Hunting Ground, where hunters are always cautious, either traveling in groups or concealing their aura.  No one would be so brazen. Should they attract a swarm of powerful demons, this individual will surely meet a grisly end.</p><p>Strangely, even after entering the deepest part of the Hunting Ground, no demonic beast attacks them.</p><p>Within the Hunting Ground,</p><p>Two figures fly out from an unnamed islet.  Both are Nascent Soul Masters, facing west, standing in mid-air with respectful expressions, as if awaiting a great personage. They show no impatience despite waiting for a long time.</p><p>Finally, a figure appears in the west.  The two show signs of relief, hurrying to greet them, “Greetings, Master!”</p><p>The arrival is Qin Sang’s true form.</p><p>Returning to the island, Qin Sang inquired about the affairs of the East Sea’s demon tribe.  Two individuals replied, “Reporting to our lord, we have, as you commanded, repeatedly infiltrated the demon tribe, secretly assisting Long Yi and Long Er in clearing obstacles, helping them establish a foothold in the East Sea.  Long Yi and Long San have even infiltrated the ranks of a demon king. Internal strife within the demon tribe is certain…”</p><p>Long Yi and Long Er are names Qin Sang gave to several earthbound dragons.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to the detailed report from the Underworld Moon Guards.  He fell silent, lost in thought.</p><p>According to the reports from Long Yi and the other demons, the warring factions are the Sacred King’s Palace and a group of powerful demons led by the Dragon Whale Sage.  The Dragon Whale still uses the title “Sage,” indicating that he hasn't reached the Divine Transformation stage.  These demons, lacking a Divine Transformation expert, dare to challenge the Sacred King’s Palace!</p><p>Even stranger is that after the Dragon Whale Sage’s rebellion, he hasn’t been suppressed by the Qinghu Sacred King; instead, the Sacred King’s Palace is gradually shrinking its territory.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Qinghu Sacred King’s statement that she didn’t care about the lives of her loyalists, but this level of forbearance is unusual.</p><p>…</p><p>Deep in the East Sea.</p><p>Sky and sea met as one.</p><p>On the boundless azure ocean, a white line suddenly appeared in the north, surging across the water with terrifying speed, possessing the power to crush mountains.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed the white line to be a towering wave, thousands of feet high.</p><p>Within the churning waters, dark shapes flickered, rising and falling.  Even without a clear view, their massive size was evident from their exposed backs.</p><p>Their backs were long and fish-like in shape.</p><p>These were indeed Dragon Whales, infamous throughout the East Sea.</p><p>Legend says Dragon Whales are volatile, their roars heard for miles, causing all other demons to flee their path. Yet, these whales moved silently, their only sound the deafening roar of the waves.</p><p>Behind the whales, a huge, dark shadow followed closely.</p><p>The shadow was square-shaped, covered by a black cloth, with numerous black ropes extending from it to bind the whales’ tails, pulling them along.</p><p>The black cloth was soft, seemingly made of some strange spiritual water.  As they sped along, it billowed in the wind, completely concealing its contents, preventing any leakage of its aura.</p><p>At the head of the whale group, a powerfully built man sat atop a Dragon Whale.</p><p>The man had a wide nose, broad mouth, and sat astride the whale, his expression as cold and hard as stone. Any word describing strength could aptly describe him. He was seemingly napping.</p><p>Suddenly, the man sensed something and opened his enormous, bell-like eyes. His gaze was like two bolts of lightning, momentarily dimming the sunlight on the sea.</p><p>Where his gaze fell, a faint mist rose from the sea.</p><p>Compared to the powerful waves, the mist seemed weak and insignificant.  Yet, the man's pupils narrowed to pinpricks.</p><p>The next moment, the mist shifted, revealing a shadowy figure.</p><p>Upon seeing the figure, the man leaped to his feet, raising his arms and letting out a long, thunderous roar. The whales' song drowned out the waves, but lacked the ethereal quality of a whale song; it was sharp and filled with rage.</p><p>Hearing the roar,</p><p>the whales suddenly stopped, their forward momentum halted.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The thousand-foot wave crashed down.</p><p>Then, piercing cries accompanied jets of water shooting towards the heavens.</p><p>The whales scattered, forming a battle formation, leaving a large open space in the center for the man, protecting him.</p><p>At the same time, the whales exerted their strength, hoisting the large dark shadow behind them, which landed steadily above the surrounding water columns, suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The figure in the mist seemed oblivious to the waiting whales, gradually revealing its form within the haze.</p><p>This person sat cross-legged atop a black fire lotus.</p><p>The fire lotus carried them slowly upwards from the sea, appearing exceptionally frail compared to any of the whales, yet daring to stand before them.</p><p>The whales stopped, facing a formidable enemy!</p><p>Their face was still unclear; they appeared to wear a green robe, their long hair flowing down their back.</p><p>Despite their presence, the whales could not sense anything unusual when they closed their eyes; it was as if the person had become one with the heavens and earth.</p><p>The man stared intently at the mist, letting out a wild roar, his bones cracking as his body swelled.</p><p>A mountainous black shadow suddenly appeared on the sea’s surface—a dragon whale, but far surpassing others in both presence and size.  It was like comparing a mountain to a hill.</p><p>This was the mightiest being of the East Sea—the Dragon Whale Saint!</p><p>He defied the Saint King’s Palace and led his forces into battle, only to encounter a mysterious figure.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint revealed his true form.  A gentle flick of his tail created enormous waves.  His massive jaws opened, and he roared angrily, “You Daoist, state your name! We have no quarrel, why obstruct my path!”</p><p>The other party didn't answer.</p><p>Only a thin fog drifted.</p><p>Outlines gradually sharpened.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint's gaze was drawn to a dark lotus beneath the shadowy figure. His giant eyes narrowed. He slammed his tail against the water’s surface.  The whales received the command, their cries echoing.</p><p>Their bodies tensed as they pulled on long ropes attached to their tails.</p><p>The shadow in the air swayed. With a ‘splash,’ a black cloth was lifted, revealing an iron cage containing a blood-red skeleton.</p><p>The flesh had been stripped from the bones, yet they were still dripping crimson, as if soaked in blood for years.  The skeleton was intact, its skull long and pointed, blood congealing in its eye sockets, making it look incredibly eerie.  From its shape, it was likely another dragon whale.</p><p>‘Clang… clang…’</p><p>The ropes tightened, the cage rattled.</p><p>As the cloth was lifted, a surge of blood energy shot upwards, a terrifyingly ferocious aura filling the air, as if a monstrous beast were about to revive, causing a chilling fear.</p><p>This aura connected with the whale pod and the Dragon Whale Saint, emanating an astonishing pressure from the whales, pointedly directed forward.</p><p>Only when the Dragon Whale Saint summoned the skeleton did the figure in the mist seem to show interest, slightly raising his head to examine the cage, letting out a light chuckle, “This is your trump card?”</p><p>The nonchalant tone enraged the Dragon Whale Saint.  He roared, “Don't be arrogant!  You Daoist, having luckily achieved the level of a Divine Transformation cultivator, yet instead of ascending, you dare stir up trouble in the East Sea! Don't you fear that you'll meet your end here, losing the fruits of a thousand years of cultivation? Ninety-nine of my sons are here. If I order them to reverse their blood flow and self-destruct, awakening the chaotic dragon whales, you will be gravely wounded and your ascension will be thwarted…”</p><p>The other party, confident in his cultivation, made no attempt to hide it.  The Dragon Whale Saint confirmed that he was a human Divine Transformation cultivator.</p><p>His threat was somewhat exaggerated, but not entirely a bluff.  Daring to challenge the Saint King’s Palace, the Dragon Whale Saint naturally had his own advantages.</p><p>The cage could be opened at any moment.  A current of blood energy constantly flowed around the skeleton, deepening its crimson hue with each circuit.</p><p>Furthermore, he had secretly contacted his allies.</p><p>His allies were not far away.</p><p>Although they suspected that the Azure Fox Saint King had already ascended to the Eastern lands, out of caution, after the uprising, they would always have their followers accompany them whenever they left their lairs.</p><p>As the roar left his mouth, the Dragon Whale Saint saw the face of the figure in the mist.  His expression froze, and he exclaimed, “It's you?”</p><p>“You know me?”</p><p>Qin Sang's features materialized from the mist, staring at the Dragon Whale Saint.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint’s eyes flickered, coldly saying, “The renowned Fire Demon. How could I not know you?”</p><p>The battle at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, where the Fire Demon confronted a Yao (demon) Saint King and killed the Saint King's illusory body with a single Firebird, was widely celebrated among humans and had reached the East Sea Yao.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint, known for his rebellious nature, was particularly interested in the Azure Fox Saint King's activities and had thoroughly investigated the incident.</p><p>Learning that the Azure Fox Saint King had provoked such a powerful enemy, the Dragon Whale Saint had been gleeful, even considering contacting Qin Sang to resist the Saint King together.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had remained secluded in Luye.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint didn’t have much time to spare and temporarily shelved the plan.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after over a hundred years, this person reappeared, and was no longer just one of them!</p><p>Rumor had it that although the strength he displayed at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was formidable, it was due to his magical treasures; his cultivation might have only recently broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Comparing himself, the Dragon Whale Saint had been stuck at the Divine Transformation bottleneck for over a thousand years, and couldn't help feeling frustrated.</p><p>“I never expected that you would attain the True Monarch realm in such a short time. I must express my admiration!”</p><p>Once Qin Sang's identity was confirmed, the Dragon Whale Saint’s tone softened.</p><p>Since this person was the Fire Demon, he couldn't possibly be allied with the Azure Fox Saint King.</p><p>The enemy of my enemy is my friend!</p><p>The Fire Demon had almost perished at the hands of the Yao Fox, and he didn't believe the Fire Demon would simply swallow his humiliation.</p><p>Enduring hardship, finally achieving Divine Transformation, and now taking revenge?</p><p>If he could win this person over, great things could be achieved!</p><p>Qin Sang keenly perceived the shift in the Dragon Whale Saint’s tone and smiled, “It seems the Saint has guessed my intentions.”</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint reverted to human form, stared intently at Qin Sang, his throat pulsed, letting out an unintelligible growl.</p><p>Behind him, the whale pod went into chaos. The whales, like hungry tigers, charged at the surrounding Jiao Shark guards, transforming the area into a sea of blood, leaving only the Dragon Whale Saint.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint said coldly, “True Monarch, you wouldn't want to reveal your whereabouts, would you? My followers are trustworthy.”</p><p>…</p><p>Unnamed Demon Island.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint sat on a high chair.</p><p>Two rows of demon kings, his allies in the uprising, sat beneath him.</p><p>Because of a remark made by one of the Dragon Whale Saint's leading generals, the demons were engaged in heated debate.</p><p>“We can’t confirm that the sly fox has truly ascended. Forcing a decisive battle with the Saint King’s Palace now might push her to desperation!”</p><p>“Exactly! We follow the Great Saint because that sly fox was too domineering, monopolizing several sacred lands. Now that the Saint King’s Palace forces are retreating, and the sacred lands are about to fall into our hands, why create unnecessary trouble?”</p><p>…</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint watched the demons debate silently.</p>
