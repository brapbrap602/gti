<h1>Chapter 2067: The Foul Land</h1><p>Yuan Miao was momentarily stunned.  Previously, Qin Sang had remained entirely on the defensive. This was perfectly normal; facing the relentless pursuit of the Zhu Yan clan, most people could only barely parry blows, not for lack of wanting to counterattack, but simply because they lacked the opportunity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, their opponent had been playing with them all along!</p><p>As the last word left Qin Sang's lips, the sound seemed to ring out right beside Yuan Miao's ear.  Only then did he feel the imminent danger. A streak of green lightning appeared in his vision, impossibly fast, seemingly piercing the void in an instant, hurtling towards him. He reacted immediately, raising his crimson magic staff to his chest.  An incredibly powerful force slammed into him, like being struck by a mountain.  His body trembled, and his vision went black.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit tablet, like a massive stone slab, slammed down on him, held back only by the crimson magic staff. The two magical artifacts collided with earth-shattering force, causing the arena to shake again as strange lights flickered across the battlefield.</p><p>Yuan Miao was richly experienced in battle, his spiritual senses sharp, his reaction time impeccable – almost instinctive, allowing him to parry the blow in time. Anyone else might not have been defeated outright, but they would likely have lost the initiative instantly.</p><p>He channeled his blood energy with all his might, braced his arms, and shuddered the spirit tablet slightly.  His figure recoiled, attempting to create space to regain his balance, but before he could stabilize, pressure descended from above.</p><p>With no other choice, Yuan Miao raised his staff to block.</p><p>With a deafening roar, Yuan Miao was violently slammed to the ground.  He remained relatively steady, but his feet were firmly embedded in the earth.</p><p>The Zhu Yan clan placed great importance on the arena, constructing it from an incredibly hard magical material, engraved with powerful restrictions, and further reinforced by a large array. Even with the fierce earlier battle, the arena hadn't sustained any damage – now it bore two deep footprints.</p><p>Just as Yuan Miao was about to employ the same tactic again, he felt the spirit tablet lift, only to feel a new threat from behind. He had no time to move, so he forcefully twisted his staff to block the attack.</p><p>The next scene evoked a sense of familiarity in onlookers like Si Lu. They had just witnessed the same sequence, only with the roles reversed.</p><p>Now it was Yuan Miao’s turn to be pummeled. Facing Qin Sang's relentless assault, Yuan Miao could only defend, his feet sinking deeper into the ground, unable to pull them free, as Qin Sang hammered him blow after blow, sinking him deeper and deeper, almost to his calves.</p><p>At that moment, Yuan Miao felt immense frustration. This was his signature fighting style, and now his opponent was using it against him.  Qin Sang's combat abilities surpassed his expectations.  Superior escape techniques were one thing; seamlessly integrating them into combat was another.</p><p>Especially in a physical clash between two cultivators of physical strength, the situation could shift in an instant.  Even the best escape techniques might not be effective. Improper use could leave one vulnerable, allowing the opponent to exploit weaknesses – and this was precisely the opportunity Yuan Miao had been waiting for.</p><p>However, Qin Sang seemed unconcerned by such risks. They didn't even utilize any advanced divine arts or battle techniques.  With only the art of lightning escape and that spirit tablet, they had completely pinned him down.</p><p>Even when Qin Sang used the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, Yuan Miao had sensed it, but he hadn't anticipated this power.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Yuan Miao knew he’d sunk another inch. He felt like a stake, and Qin Sang was the one driving it in.</p><p>This situation had to change!</p><p>Finding no opening, Yuan Miao decided to create one. He immediately changed his mind, and the blood flames enveloping his body erupted.</p><p>He suddenly threw back his head, his hair standing on end, seemingly transforming into a raging inferno.</p><p>Points of bloody light emerged from the flames, coalescing on his forehead, blooming into a blood flower.  After undergoing a strange transformation, it formed a small blood seal, flashing into Yuan Miao's brow.</p><p>A low growl resonated across the battlefield, sounding like a demonic ape's roar echoing from ancient times.</p><p>Ji Hong and the Zhu Yan expert both heard the roar, their hearts pounding, their fighting spirits ignited. The Zhu Yan expert leaped to his feet, agitatedly scratching his ears, desperately watching the arena, wishing he could take Yuan Miao's place.</p><p>Fortunately, he had not completely lost his senses. He glanced at Ji Hong, his eyes filled with battle intent, eager to fight.</p><p>Sensing danger, Ji Hong quickly hid under Si Lu's collar.</p><p>The situation on the battlefield had shifted. Yuan Miao abruptly opened his eyes, his pupils crimson, radiating a ferocious intent, seemingly truly transformed into a demonic ape.</p><p>A crimson-red demonic staff pointed skyward, a妖艳 blood-red glow momentarily appearing on its surface before dissipating, instantly splitting into thousands of staff shadows.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were serious. To him, all the other shadows were nonexistent; only one crimson-red staff was rushing towards his face.</p><p>This strike was extraordinarily subtle.  It was unclear how Yuan Miao managed it – did he preemptively judge Qin Sang's landing point, or would this strike always find its mark regardless of where Qin Sang landed?</p><p>In any case, the crimson-red staff was already before Qin Sang the moment he arrived, leaving no room to dodge!</p><p>He immediately made a decisive decision, abandoning his offensive and forcefully flapping his "Phoenix Wings" to escape the battlefield.</p><p>A fierce gust of wind sliced past him.  Yuan Miao missed, but his goal was achieved. He sprang into the air, leaping from the pit, somersaulted in mid-air, and counterattacked.</p><p>Facing the incoming crimson-red staff, Qin Sang retreated again, but this time only to create distance from Yuan Miao. Then, he transformed into a streak of lightning, approaching Yuan Miao from a very tricky angle.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Their weapons clashed, both figures reeling.  Qin Sang narrowed his eyes; Yuan Miao's response was noticeably more composed.  Before the effect of the blood seal faded, suppressing Yuan Miao as he had before seemed impossible.</p><p>While contemplating this, Qin Sang's afterimage shattered under the demonic staff as he reappeared elsewhere, resuming his attack with his spirit tablet.</p><p>The two clashed repeatedly, their fight now spreading across the entire arena. If not for the restricting array, their battle would have extended beyond the heavens.</p><p>Although Qin Sang continued to employ hit-and-run tactics and aggressive attacks, his strategy had changed.  He no longer focused on suppressing his opponent, instead maximizing the advantages of his escape techniques, looking for openings in his opponent's defense during the skirmishes.</p><p>Yuan Miao countered accordingly. He might not be able to catch Qin Sang, but Qin Sang would always attack.  By making the perfect counter-move during each exchange, Yuan Miao could render Qin Sang helpless.</p><p>On the north side of the main arena was a slightly shorter peak, and a smaller arena atop it.</p><p>At some point, the array on this smaller arena was also activated, but no one was fighting. Only a single figure stood there.</p><p>This person, clad in white robes, had golden eyes that shone with a strange light as they watched the duel across the way.</p><p>The great array couldn't obstruct their gaze.  Watching the two combatants, they showed a curious glimmer in their eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yuan Miao seemed oblivious, their eyes only on their opponent. After a fierce exchange, neither could gain the upper hand, but both were searching for an opportunity.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Another clash, equally matched as before, and the two separated.</p><p>At that moment, a gleam flashed in Yuan Miao's eyes.</p><p>The opportunity!</p><p>Finally!</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang felt a strange anomaly, sensing something wasn't right. He looked at Yuan Miao, who was enveloped in blood flames, seemingly normal, but the strange feeling persisted.</p><p>He was certain the blood flames had undergone some change, but he didn't understand why.</p><p>The next moment, his eyes widened in astonishment.  Yuan Miao had grown two additional heads behind his original one, identical to himself.  Not only heads, but also arms, and even the crimson-red staff had tripled.</p><p>“Three heads and six arms?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recognized this legendary spell, finally witnessing it firsthand.</p><p>The new limbs were slightly illusory, not yet fully solidified, but Yuan Miao's aura had clearly reached a new level.</p><p>‘Swish swish swish!’</p><p>Giving Qin Sang no time to analyze the technique, the three staffs attacked simultaneously.</p><p>Three beams of blood-red light tore through the void, with enough force to destroy mountains and land.  Before Qin Sang, they converged into a single, devastatingly large staff shadow.</p><p>This shadow enveloped every corner of the arena.  Under the demonic staff, all would be reduced to dust. Even with Qin Sang's superb escape techniques, there was nowhere to hide!</p><p>As the staff descended, Qin Sang's expression turned grim.  He formed a hand seal, instantly causing golden light to erupt, a golden sun rising behind his head.</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal was a secret technique of the Buddhist Vajrayana lineage. Its original meaning was the embodiment of the physical body in dharma, but Qin Sang, through his cultivation of both body and dharma, had amplified its power.</p><p>Even without activating his dharma body, wielding the seal purely with physical strength, its power was formidable.</p><p>The golden sun shone, repelling the surging blood energy.</p><p>Yuan Miao felt a surge of apprehension, a premonition of danger, but the attack was already underway, leaving no room for retraction.  The outcome would depend on who was more skilled.</p><p>The golden sun was directly in the path of the demonic staff; the two immense forces collided in an instant.</p><p>Wow!</p><p>A blinding wave of golden light swept across the entire arena, engulfing Qin Sang, Yuan Miao, Jin Ri, and the magic staff.  The arena was ablaze with golden light.</p><p>The next moment, a crimson staff shadow suddenly appeared in the center of the golden light, looking like a crack in Jin Ri itself.  Suddenly, Jin Ri and the staff shadow shattered simultaneously. The remaining shockwave was immense, with waves constantly impacting the protective barrier.</p><p>Only a transparent barrier separated the viewing platform from the barrier.  Under the impact of the shockwaves, the barrier trembled, seemingly about to break at any moment, with the golden energy threatening to spill out.</p><p>Ji Hong shrank his small head into Si Lu's collar, and the Zhu Yan expert shrank his neck, his fighting spirit completely gone.</p><p>The vast shockwave lingered for a long time, yet booming sounds continued from within, clearly indicating that the battle had resumed.</p><p>Yuan Miao, still in his three-headed, six-armed form, wielded the magic staff flawlessly, giving Qin Sang no opportunity, but he couldn't overcome Qin Sang either.</p><p>After a few more exchanges, Yuan Miao suddenly withdrew his divine powers, leaped out of the battle circle, and shouted, "No more! No more!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. His spirit tablet returned to the size of his palm, his phoenix wings folded, and he slowly landed on the ground.</p><p>"I can't hurt you, but you could hurt me!  This time, you win! No more! No more!"</p><p>Yuan Miao waved his hands repeatedly, his expression somewhat dejected.</p><p>To be sure, continuing the fight might have resulted in neither side winning, but as he said, Qin Sang could potentially injure him, while he hadn't found a way to counter Qin Sang's escape technique.  Thus, it wasn't unreasonable to say he was slightly inferior.</p><p>The Zhu Yan are a warlike people, but once they recognize the situation, a loss is a loss, a win is a win, and they won't stubbornly cling to the fight.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, "Daoist friend, you've conceded."</p><p>He had hidden his strength, but this certainly wasn't all of Yuan Miao's strength either.  Some methods simply weren't suitable for use in the arena, after all, it wasn't a fight to the death.</p><p>"I'll find a way to counter your escape technique eventually!" Yuan Miao grumbled, still unconvinced.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, he didn't dislike this kind of temperament, and bowed, "I await your arrival, Daoist friend."</p><p>"You just wait!"</p><p>Yuan Miao issued a harsh warning, waved his sleeve, and dismissed the spirit formation.</p><p>Si Lu flew over, looking at Qin Sang with a hint of amazement. He knew that Qin Sang's greatest strength was his Dharma body, yet he had defeated Yuan Miao using only his physical strength and divine powers.</p><p>Ji Hong's eyes shone brightly, his small face full of admiration, "Qin Guard, you're so strong!"</p><p>"As promised, except for a few forbidden areas of our tribe, the three of you may come and go freely, and no one will trouble you..."</p><p>Yuan Miao flicked his sleeve, sending out three streams of light that transformed into three red jade tokens.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist friend Yuan."</p><p>The three felt Yuan Miao's energy on the jade tokens and thanked him, each putting one away.</p><p>Yuan Miao looked towards the outside of the mountain, "We agreed beforehand.  There are also dangerous places near our tribe, even nearby tribes don't dare to approach easily. If you venture into them and die, don't blame anyone."</p><p>"Thank you for your warning, we understand the dangers," Si Lu bowed.</p><p>Seeing their expressions, Yuan Miao knew they hadn't taken his warning to heart, and snorted, "Don't think I'm exaggerating. Our tribe is unlike other places. To the east, there's a place where foul energy gathers, absolutely avoid it."</p><p>Ji Hong and Si Lu hadn't reacted yet, but Qin Sang's eyes flashed, "Foul energy?"</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded, "The source of this energy is unknown, but it pollutes everything, leaving nothing untouched, and it's extremely dangerous to us cultivators.  It has its ebbs and flows. Don't be fooled by its seeming calm during its low tide. Once the foul energy surges, it consumes everything, even powerful cultivators might not survive!"</p><p>Pollutes everything, leaves nothing untouched...</p><p>The more Qin Sang listened, the more he felt that the foul energy was similar to the Six Heavens' Evil Qi from the River of Woe.</p><p>After entering the Great Thousand World for so long, Qin Sang had traveled through several Heavenly States, yet he'd heard no rumors of the River of Woe.</p><p>He suspected that the River of Woe existed in another form, usually invisible to the world, undetectable except by powerful cultivators.</p><p>Could this be a manifestation of the River of Woe?</p><p>Qin Sang had always suspected that the Storm World's Abyss might be located on the River of Woe.  Thus, the Storm World, expelled by the River of Woe, appearing here, seemed plausible.</p><p>"I've said all I need to.  Please feel free to leave!"</p><p>Yuan Miao waved his sleeve, gesturing for them to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu exchanged glances, knowing they couldn't press further, and bowed their farewells.</p><p>After the three figures disappeared into the mountains, Yuan Miao retracted his gaze, looked towards a nearby peak, his figure flickered, and he disappeared into it, asking, "When did Brother Yuan arrive?"</p>
