<h1>Chapter 1134: The White Cat</h1><p>The street was quiet.  </p><p>A ray of sunlight streamed in, falling on the counter and forming a patch of light.  </p><p>The white cat lay basking in the warm sunlight, eyes closed, exuding an air of lazy contentment.  </p><p>Sensing someone passing by the door, the cat lifted its eyelids slightly, catching sight of the figure entering. Its eyes suddenly widened, and it stood up on its hind legs.  </p><p>"Meow!"  </p><p>"Qin Gongzi!"  </p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. His gaze quickly swept across the shop, only to find the white cat.  </p><p>"You know me?"  </p><p>He had come to this shop on the advice of Yunyouzi, who had mentioned that he could meet some old acquaintances here—beasts from the Thousand Bamboo Sea. He hadn’t expected it to be a cat.  </p><p>As he studied the white cat, a flash of memory struck Qin Sang.  </p><p>This was the very same white cat that had sold him the Spirit Eye Cave in the ancient kingdom of Guyuan!  </p><p>Back then, Senior Brother Wen from Shaohua Mountain had sent him to Guyuan to deal with a disciple who had been practicing demonic arts and causing havoc in the mortal world. It was there that Qin Sang had first encountered the white cat.  </p><p>From the cat, he had learned that she had been enlightened by a bamboo demon elder who had bestowed her with the Celestial Nectar, awakening her spiritual intelligence. After that, she had cultivated in the cave.  </p><p>However, the bamboo demon elder had never returned.  </p><p>Left to cultivate alone, without guidance, she had no idea how to proceed. She decided to seek the Dao in the Heavenly Demon Hills and traded the cave for a geomantic map and protective artifacts.  </p><p>"Ah! It’s you! The bamboo demon who enlightened you was Senior Yunyouzi!"  </p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.  </p><p>When Yunyouzi was still in his original form as the Pure Fortune Bamboo, he had traveled to Guyuan and enlightened the white cat. They had agreed that he would take her back to the Thousand Bamboo Sea in the Heavenly Demon Hills upon his return.  </p><p>However, an unexpected event had occurred.  </p><p>The Pure Fortune Bamboo had failed its tribulation, and its spirit had merged with Yunyouzi’s. With his cultivation lost and his own survival uncertain, Yunyouzi had been unable to fulfill his promise to the white cat.  </p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the white cat was not surprised, clearly already aware of his relationship with Yunyouzi.  </p><p>Yet, despite meeting an old acquaintance, the cat showed no joy.  </p><p>"Qin Gongzi, has the bamboo demon elder…"  </p><p>The white cat’s eyes filled with hesitation and disbelief.  </p><p>Previously, Yunyouzi had sent her a message: if anything happened to him, he would entrust his affairs to Qin Sang.  </p><p>She had waited in the Immortal-Demon City for many years, but there had been no news from Yunyouzi. Now, with Qin Sang’s arrival but no sign of Yunyouzi, the white cat had a foreboding feeling.  </p><p>She had always had boundless faith in the bamboo demon elder and had never imagined he could fail.  </p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes dimmed. He nodded and sighed softly, "The elder failed his tribulation…"  </p><p>The white cat’s eyes instantly reddened, tears welling up. She stared blankly out the window, then curled up, burying her head in silence.  </p><p>Yunyouzi had enlightened her, awakening her spiritual intelligence—a kindness akin to rebirth.  </p><p>When Qin Sang had last parted with the white cat, she had been a mere fledgling demon in the Mortal Demon stage. Now, she had clearly reached the Demon Core stage.  </p><p>Aside from the descendants of divine beasts and immortal birds, the cultivation speed of demons was far slower than that of human cultivators.  </p><p>The white cat’s progress was due to her own innate talent and, undoubtedly, Yunyouzi’s meticulous guidance. After all, Yunyouzi had once been a transformed bamboo demon and had a deep understanding of demonic cultivation.  </p><p>To the white cat, Yunyouzi was like a master and a father—their bond was profound.  </p><p>After a long silence, the white cat lifted her head, her eyes still red, and whispered, "I’m sorry, Qin Gongzi. I lost my composure."  </p><p>Qin Sang empathized deeply. Seeing that the white cat had calmed, he explained his purpose.  </p><p>"I understand how you feel. Senior Yunyouzi was also a dear friend and benefactor to me. Before his passing, he entrusted me with some matters, including the affairs of the Thousand Bamboo Sea and its inhabitants. He hoped that after I formed my Nascent Soul, I could offer some assistance. Unfortunately, my talent is lacking, and despite years of arduous cultivation, I’ve yet to break through my bottleneck. I came here to first connect with you, inform you of the elder’s passing, and see what I can do…"  </p><p>"This isn’t the place to talk. Please follow me, Gongzi."  </p><p>The white cat raised a paw, closing the doors and windows, then jumped off the counter and led Qin Sang to the back hall.  </p><p>Entering the white cat’s cave, Qin Sang noticed that its layout closely resembled her previous dwelling—a nostalgic touch from the cat demon.  </p><p>"After parting with you, Gongzi, I relied on the geomantic map, artifacts, and the *Escape Spirit Technique* you gave me to safely traverse human territory and reach the Thousand Bamboo Sea, where I met Grandpa Liu…"  </p><p>The white cat rallied her spirits and recounted the past to Qin Sang.  </p><p>"Grandpa Liu? The willow tree spirit?"  </p><p>Qin Sang asked, recalling Yunyouzi’s mention of him.  </p><p>The ancient willow tree was the only late-stage Demon Core demon in the Thousand Bamboo Sea, a willow spirit who had attained the Dao. There was also a mid-stage Demon Core macaque, both of whom were trustworthy.  </p><p>The white cat nodded and continued, "After the bamboo demon elder disappeared, Grandpa Liu and Grandpa Macaque struggled to hold things together. Later, the bamboo demon elder finally returned, and we learned that he had become human. At that time, the elder was only at the Golden Core stage and couldn’t reveal his true identity before forming his Nascent Soul. So, in the entire Thousand Bamboo Sea, only Grandpa Liu and I knew the elder’s true identity… Thanks to his guidance, I’ve reached where I am today. I’ve long known of you, Qin Gongzi, from the elder’s words. He held you in high regard and often lamented your disappearance. I’m glad you’re safe and sound…"  </p><p>After listening to the white cat’s detailed account, Qin Sang gained a clearer understanding of Yunyouzi’s past experiences.  </p><p>Yunyouzi had intended to reunite with his old acquaintances after forming his Nascent Soul. After all, his situation was unique—he was an anomaly in the cultivation world. Revealing his identity carelessly, even to those closest to him, could lead to unforeseen consequences.  </p><p>However, he hadn’t anticipated the sudden invasion of the Sin Abyss.  </p><p>The Heavenly Demon Hills had a pact with the human race.  </p><p>During intense warfare, the demon race couldn’t stand idly by and would dispatch demon armies to assist, some led by demon kings and others temporarily under the command of human cultivators.  </p><p>As for how the demon race internally allocated their forces, that was decided through discussions among the major demon kings.  </p><p>The master of the Thousand Bamboo Sea had never shown himself, and the other demon kings had begun to grow suspicious. Without a demon king’s protection, the entire Thousand Bamboo Sea might have been conscripted as cannon fodder.  </p><p>After returning from the Purple Micro Palace, Yunyouzi’s cultivation advanced rapidly, breaking through multiple stages. By then, he had the strength to protect himself and promptly returned to the Thousand Bamboo Sea, revealing his identity to the willow tree demon.  </p><p>After some deliberation, they set up a spirit formation in the old cave as a disguise.  </p><p>Since the two-domain alliance wasn’t at a disadvantage and the war hadn’t reached its peak, the master of the Thousand Bamboo Sea never directly appeared, and they managed to keep his absence hidden.  </p><p>"Does every demon king control a demon city?"  </p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.  </p><p>One of his purposes in meeting the white cat was to learn more about the customs of the Heavenly Demon Hills.  </p><p>The white cat shook her head repeatedly. "Of course not. The Celestial Nectar is extremely precious. Demon kings only spare a portion to enlighten their descendants or promising young demons, making them trusted aides to manage their territories. Truly enlightened demons are very few, and most remain wild, unable to stay peacefully in a demon city. Excluding this Immortal-Demon City, there’s actually only one demon city in the Heavenly Demon Hills—the Ten Thousand Demon City at the northernmost edge, near the entrance to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Its lord is the Feather Demon King, and its inhabitants are said to be mostly human…"</p>
