<h1>Chapter 607: Bones Littering the Field</h1><p>Chapter 607: Bones Littering the Field</p><p>Is this the summit of the Tianshan Mountains?</p><p>Qin Sang thought silently, curious about the purpose of these magnificent palaces and the mysterious black tower, and why they were destroyed.</p><p>Since entering the Purple Micro Palace, he had witnessed many strange places, significantly increasing his resilience.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai and the others were captivated by the surrounding scenery, their eyes glued to the breathtaking sights.</p><p>“Let’s work together to ascend the tower. We’ll be faster, and hopefully reach the top before they break the magical barrier. While most of those old fellows will be drawn to the core area, we can’t rule out someone passing by and discovering us.”</p><p>Dongyang Bo summoned his life-bound treasure, the Vajra Wheel.</p><p>Chen Yan produced a sword; its slender, elegant shape was striking.  The hilt was a flawless crystal carved into a phoenix, exquisitely beautiful.</p><p>She held the Phoenix Sword, her bearing valiant and graceful.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>With a swing of the Phoenix Sword, a phoenix-shaped energy blade shot forth, letting out a soft chirp.</p><p>Dongyang Bo timely summoned the Vajra Wheel, releasing a shadow of the wheel.  It collided with the Phoenix energy blade against the tower door.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>After a sound like the clash of metal, the Phoenix energy blade and the wheel shadow dissipated. The tower door flashed, and countless eerie runes appeared, resembling demonic figures.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's expression turned serious. He unleashed a barrage of wheel shadows from the Vajra Wheel. Chen Yan responded in kind.</p><p>Their cooperation was seamless.</p><p>Soon, the runes on the tower door shattered with a dull thud, and the door slowly opened.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Dongyang Bo sheathed the Vajra Wheel, shouting in a low voice, and charged into the black tower.  The others quickly followed.</p><p>Before entering, none of them expected the interior to be anything but a cramped space. Instead, it was unexpectedly vast, stretching beyond sight.</p><p>The unusually dark space featured rolling hills.</p><p>But the atmosphere was deathly still; there wasn’t a hint of greenery, only barren, rocky mountains.  While some riverbeds existed, they were all dry.</p><p>The shocking thing was that the entire space was covered in bones, scattered everywhere, with occasional broken weapons visible amongst them.</p><p>This place seemed to have once been a battleground, a scene of horrific slaughter!</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai and the others were stunned by this horrifying sight.</p><p>The dark little tower was actually a horrific place!</p><p>The bones were pulverized, making it impossible to tell if they belonged to humans or demons. The weapons were heavily rusted, their power completely gone.</p><p>The good news was the surrounding quiet; nothing frightening appeared.</p><p>If whatever slaughtered these beings were still present, everyone there would have perished without a trace.</p><p>They found themselves on a mountain, with a mountain wall behind them.  A translucent door, faintly visible, floated in the center of the wall.</p><p>After entering, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan seemed to have ignored the bones scattered everywhere; they flew straight into the depths of the space, traversing mountains and valleys, until they found a dark stone.</p><p>After a concerted attack, restrictions manifested on the stone. Once broken, just like the mountain wall, another identical door appeared.</p><p>One door seemed to represent one level of the black tower.</p><p>Nobody knew how many levels the black tower had.</p><p>Qin Sang, Qiu Mu Bai, and the others silently followed, watching Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan break through door after door, ascending layer by layer. Each level was a similarly vast space.</p><p>The scenery in each space varied, but they all shared one thing: bones covering the ground, evidence of slaughter.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others grew numb, unable to count how many beings had perished here.</p><p>The higher they went, the more concealed the doors became, and the stronger the restrictions on them.</p><p>Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan’s progress slowed considerably; they eventually needed to take pills and rest before continuing to break the restrictions.</p><p>However, they never asked Qin Sang and the others for help.</p><p>“The seventh level!”</p><p>Another door was opened.</p><p>This time it was extremely difficult. Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan exerted all their strength before finally breaking the restrictions on the door.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the new space, silently counting the levels. Including the initial door, they had opened seven doors, reaching the seventh level of the black tower.</p><p>More endless bones.</p><p>Qin Sang stared blankly at the surroundings. The atmosphere was eerily quiet; no one felt like speaking.</p><p>The casual ease on Qiu Mu Bai and the others’ faces had vanished. Each of them was pensive, as if they had realized something.</p><p>As top-tier disciples in their realm, with promising futures, they were somewhat proud. But seeing this small tower, a tomb for countless bones, left them all speechless.</p><p>Their cultivation was barely superior to these skeletons in life, perhaps even inferior; what was there to be proud of?</p><p>Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan, having recovered, continued their journey.</p><p>After traveling a considerable distance, they arrived at a pile of bones.</p><p>Pushing aside the bones, they revealed a cave.  The entrance to this level was hidden within an underground cave—how they had found it was a mystery.</p><p>The cave, too, was filled with bones, which creaked underfoot. At the far end, they encountered an earthen wall. Dongyang Bo turned to Qin Sang and the other four, commanding, "Now, summon your Five Elements Beast Seals, awaken the beast souls, and help us break the barrier!"</p><p>Are we nearing the top of the tower?</p><p>Qin Sang mused inwardly, replying affirmatively. She focused her consciousness on the beast seal within her body and summoned it.</p><p>The underground chamber was not large; the five of them standing before the earthen wall nearly filled it. Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan retreated to either side, also summoning their respective magical artifacts, preparing to break the barrier.</p><p>The Five Elements Beast Seals were arranged according to the five cardinal directions.</p><p>Ji Qing held the Gou Chen Beast Seal in the center, though the core of the formation was actually Qiu Mu Bai, the ostensibly strongest among them.</p><p>"Form the array!"</p><p>The five stood in position, raising their beast seals high.</p><p>Following Qiu Mu Bai's command, they all immersed their minds into the seals, unsealing the beast souls within.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Instantly, a thunderous roar echoed through the narrow passage.  Bone fragments scattered across the ground.</p><p>"Roar roar…"</p><p>The roars intensified, and the five beast seals simultaneously emitted dazzling light.</p><p>A phantom shadow crawled out from the Xuanwu Beast Seal in Qin Sang's hand—powerful limbs, a heavy shell, sharp fangs—not vastly different from a real Xuanwu.</p><p>The other beast souls were similar; though artificially crafted, they appeared remarkably lifelike.</p><p>These beast souls were extremely ferocious, threatening to attack and turn against their masters, but were firmly suppressed.</p><p>"I shall lead, Five Elements unite!"</p><p>After the beast souls stabilized, Qiu Mu Bai roared, and Qin Sang and the others quickly channeled their beast souls, directing them towards Qiu Mu Bai's White Tiger beast soul.</p><p>One by one, the phantom figures merged into the White Tiger beast soul.</p><p>The unified Five Elements beast soul was oddly shaped, its form no longer discernible.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai bore immense pressure, his face ashen. His beast seal shattered first, followed by the others.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Using his last ounce of strength, Qiu Mu Bai propelled the beast soul into the earthen wall!</p>
