<h1>Chapter 1487: Floating Mountain</h1><p>Chapter 1487: Floating Mountain</p><p>Resisting Demons Island.</p><p>As the name suggests, this island is named for the demon race.  Many years ago, during internal strife within the Xuan Tian Palace, demons repeatedly exploited the chaos, invading the mainland and slaughtering mortals and low-level cultivators.  The Yinri region was stained with blood, a horrific sight.</p><p>Only after the four factions made peace and the Xuan Tian Palace united did they mount an effective counterattack, finally driving the demon army out of the Yinri region.</p><p>Resisting Demons Island was one of the key locations in that battle.  Since then, the Xuan Tian Palace ceased its internal conflicts, gradually recovering its strength.  Repeated demon attacks have all failed, reaching no further than Resisting Demons Island.</p><p>Currently, Grand Elder Tong Lingyu commands the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators from Resisting Demons Island, leading the defense against the demons.  For the Xuan Tian Palace, it's another sacred site.  Years of effort have made Resisting Demons Island impregnable.  The entire island and a large surrounding area of the sea are covered by a powerful formation, hidden within a perpetual mist.  If the demons launch a full-scale invasion, Resisting Demons Island will be the strongest fortress.</p><p>Guards patrol within the mist, maintaining strict vigilance.  Teams of cultivators come and go, many with powerful auras, their hurried movements adding to the tense atmosphere.</p><p>At this moment, three figures arrived from the Yinri region.  They were Shi Xue, Liuli, and Qin Sang.</p><p>In recent years, Shi Xue has mostly been stationed on Resisting Demons Island, assisting Tong Lingyu.  She had only returned to the Listening Snow Tower for a few days to attend to some matters, when the situation on the battlefield changed, forcing her to rush back with Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>The three approached the island.  A beam of light shot out from the depths of the mist, carrying a strong hostile intent as a warning.</p><p>Shi Xue signaled for Qin Sang and Liuli to stop, then raised a token and showed it. The light halted, revealing a group of guards.</p><p>The leader, a Golden Core cultivator, remained composed, bowing respectfully, "Greetings, Master Shi."</p><p>Shi Xue nodded, gesturing to those behind her, "These are my junior sister Liuli and the Listening Snow Tower's guest elder, Qingfeng Daochang."</p><p>The guard looked at Qin Sang and Liuli, took out his own token, held it in his palm, and closed his eyes slightly. The token glowed faintly, seemingly establishing a connection with somewhere on the island.</p><p>Meanwhile, both Qin Sang and Liuli felt like they were being scrutinized.  This was their first time on Resisting Demons Island, and such an examination was standard procedure, even with Shi Xue bringing them.</p><p>After a moment, the guard's expression softened, and he stepped aside, revealing a path through the mist.</p><p>The three proceeded slowly.  As they landed on Resisting Demons Island, a figure landed before them—Elder Mei.</p><p>"You've arrived." Elder Mei greeted them with a smile, then produced two tokens, giving one to Qin Sang and the other to Liuli.  "Refine them with your blood; entering will be much easier in the future... Come, the Grand Elder is waiting for you."</p><p>As they walked, Shi Xue took the opportunity to ask Elder Mei about the situation.</p><p>"As you know, in the last battle, we abandoned the outer islands, but we retreated in time, minimizing our losses.  Neither side gained a decisive advantage, and there were no significant casualties.  The battle ended rather anticlimactically."</p><p>Elder Mei briefly summarized the previous events, then continued, "The Tianpeng Old Demon is ambitious and surely won't accept this outcome. The Grand Elder anticipated this, but not how quickly, nor the scale of this renewed attack.  The previous assaults were less concerning.  Recently, we discovered some new faces among the demon army..."</p><p>Elder Mei paused, looking at Qin Sang, "Thanks to Qingfeng Daochang's intelligence, we quickly identified them.  They're demon kings who are allied with the Nine-Headed Great Sage!"</p><p>Shi Xue's expression changed slightly, "Is the Nine-Headed Great Sage joining the battle?"</p><p>The Nine-Headed Great Sage has been renowned for many years, and known for its aloof nature.  For years, Tianpeng Great Sage fought alone, with the Nine-Headed Great Sage offering no help. This led some to suspect the Nine-Headed Great Sage had encountered some difficulty, was severely injured, or even perished.</p><p>Every creature has its own path and its own tribulations. Demon tribulations are unlike those of humans, varying even between different bloodlines.  Humans cannot accurately judge the Nine-Headed Great Sage's status.  The battlefield situation also plays a role.</p><p>The Star Sand Islands lack powerful cultivators, and the Xuan Tian Palace previously remained on the sidelines, allowing the Tianpeng Great Sage to face no formidable opponents. If it had faced mortal danger, the Nine-Headed Great Sage would likely not have stood by and let its kin perish.</p><p>"That possibility can't be ruled out," said Elder Mei.</p><p>A silence fell.</p><p>They left unspoken the fact that Xuan Tian Palace boasted two Yuan Ying late-stage masters – the Palace Master and the Grand Elder – enough to withstand even a full-scale妖族 assault.  The problem was, the Palace Master hadn't appeared publicly in a long time.</p><p>It was clear to everyone that the Palace Master's condition was worse than anticipated.  While Xuan Tian Palace had many Yuan Ying cultivators and overall strong strength, capable of fighting the two great妖族 saints, without the Palace Master to intervene, a confrontation with the Nine-Headed Saint would inevitably result in heavy casualties.</p><p>No one could guarantee they wouldn't be caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained calm and unconcerned.  His only worry was whether this妖族 unrest would affect the Sacred Land.</p><p>As they spoke, the four flew to the highest peak of Ju Yao Island.  A grand hall stood atop the mountain, serving as a meeting place.  Elders, Hall Masters, and representatives from Xuan Tian Palace's four main branches and several of its strongest branches were mostly present, some having missed the wedding ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately lagged behind, demonstrating humility.  Still, many eyes fell upon this son-in-law of the Ting Xue Tower.</p><p>They held no contempt, however.  Being a "son-in-law" required considerable strength and talent to earn respect, and Qin Sang clearly possessed both.</p><p>Shi Xue introduced Qin Sang to several cultivators he hadn't met before, and they exchanged greetings.</p><p>After they settled, a few more arrived, including Tong Lingyu, who came late but wasted no time getting to the point.  The matter of the two great妖族 saints and the Sacred Land sparked debate among the various branches, with disagreements erupting. The power of the four main branches was evident; unreasonable proposals could be vetoed.</p><p>With Qin Sang and Liuli sitting behind her, Shi Xue argued confidently and logically.</p><p>Qin Sang remained quiet and observant.</p><p>By late night, a fragile consensus was reached.  If the situation didn't improve, a large contingent would have to remain on Ju Yao Island when the Sacred Land opened.</p><p>Those with a chance to compete for the Cleansing Pool, like Qin Sang, would certainly go to the Sacred Land, but would also undertake more dangerous missions beforehand to compensate those unable to enter.</p><p>Such were the complex power struggles and compromises required among and within the various branches, testing the abilities of Tong Lingyu and the branch leaders.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were assigned a mission to investigate the front lines.</p><p>As long as his Sacred Land eligibility wasn't revoked, Qin Sang had no objections and readily accepted the task.</p>
