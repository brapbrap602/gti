<h1>Chapter 208: Spirit Bug Centipede</h1><p>Chapter 208: Spirit Bug Centipede</p><p>The further they went inward, the narrower the tunnel became. At the end was a tight space that could only accommodate several people. About a dozen even narrower tunnels branched off downward, extending in various directions. At the very end, they crisscrossed, their numerous branches resembling a spider web.</p><p>This was the deepest location in the entire mineral vein, and it was also the tunnel where dry sun quartz was most easily excavated.</p><p>Due to the instability of the cloud device, they had to excavate the dry sun quartz quickly and then leave the Great Rift before the astrolabe was destroyed due to exhausted power.</p><p>Stopping at the end of the tunnel, Yin Xingge surveyed the various branch tunnels and turned around to say, “We wasted too much time earlier, and the astrolabe’s power has been partially exhausted. It won’t be able to last for long. We must complete the mission and leave this place as soon as possible. Fellow Daoist Mu, the three of you should work together to activate the astrolabe while I personally lead several fellow Daoists to go excavate the dry sun quartz.”</p><p>Cloud Vagrant Daoist had no doubts and agreed immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng exchanged a glance, then both nodded and said, “We’ll have to trouble Fellow Daoist Yin.”</p><p>Mu Yifeng had already made arrangements.</p><p>The closest town to the Great Rift was called Yuan Sky Town, built within Yuan Sky Secret Realm. There was a Shaohua Mountain stronghold inside, and the sect’s experts in the stronghold must have received news by now.</p><p>For this reason, Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng would not choose this moment to clash with Yin Xingge. Instead, they would adopt an attitude of complete obedience to avoid startling the snake.</p><p>After leaving the Great Rift, even if the sect’s experts did not manage to arrive in time, they only needed to find an excuse to lead Yin Xingge on a detour around Yuan Sky Town, and they could capture Yin Xingge without any effort. This required tacit cooperation from both of them and could not arouse any suspicion from Yin Xingge. Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng had discussed it several times and had already decided on a strategy.</p><p>If Yin Xingge truly dared to monopolize the dry sun crystal, the major sects of Suspended Skull Pass would not let him off easily.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and Qin Sang also had no intention of monopolizing the dry sun crystal.</p><p>Firstly, Yin Xingge was difficult to deal with, and there were so many people present that it would be hard to hide from them. Secondly, if the sect experts managed to obtain the dry sun crystal, it would be the same as it falling into Shaohua Mountain’s hands. Not only would they not miss out on the meritorious service, but they also would not be stingy with their rewards.</p><p>Yin Xingge was slightly suspicious, not expecting Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng to agree so readily, without any doubts whatsoever. The prepared speech he had planned was now useless. Since it had been so smooth, he naturally would not create additional trouble and withdrew his spiritual power from the cloud disk. After allocating the personnel, he moved out immediately.</p><p>The seven people split up and each chose a different tunnel. Each of them carried a jade talisman, which they could crush and use to call for help if they encountered any danger.</p><p>Qin Sang’s group of three remained on the spot, sitting on the ground in a zifu shape, and worked together to activate the astrolabe. They made the astrolabe’s power spread along the tunnel, covering the entire area below. This allowed the others to focus on excavating the dry sun quartz without worrying about exposing their aura.</p><p>Everyone had their own responsibilities, and the ancient mineral vein seemed to have regained its tranquility. Only the astrolabe slowly rotated above the three of them, its starlight specks appearing exceptionally deep and beautiful.</p><p>After breaking free from Qin Sang’s gaze, Yin Xingge looked back and suddenly activated his movement technique. Like lightning, he rapidly swept inward toward the depths of the mineral vein.</p><p>Although the tunnel was winding, Yin Xingge did not slow down his speed in the slightest. Suddenly, a gray and white gas flashed in front of him. Judging from its strange shape, he could tell that it was a cloud beast that had not yet fully taken form.</p><p>Yin Xingge flicked a finger. The Cloud Thunder Golden Net shot toward the cloud beast at high speed, opened with a sudden jerk, and several lightning ropes silently shot out, instantly binding the cloud beast tightly.</p><p>'Hiss...'</p><p>Countless electric snakes, as fine as hairs, slithered across the cloud beast’s body, causing it to quickly collapse. In the end, nothing was left but a stone about the size of an infant’s fist.</p><p>The surface of the stone was smooth and dense, but its mixed colors and dark red and gray shades did not have any of the sacred charm of a spiritual item.</p><p>This was a dry sun quartz that had been polluted by the cloud beast’s spirit power. If the cloud beast had already taken form and its spirit power had completely polluted the spiritual item, rendering it unusable for refining spiritual artifacts, this piece of dry sun quartz would become a spirit demon.</p><p>As long as he could get rid of the cloud beast’s spirit power within the dry sun quartz, he could still use it.</p><p>Yin Xingge beckoned with his hand, and the Cloud Thunder Golden Net flew back to hover above his head, coiling and uncoiling erratically. Then, he reached out and grabbed the dry sun quartz without looking at it and put it away. He continued to rush deeply into the tunnel.</p><p>From start to finish, his speed did not slow down in the slightest.</p><p>Even more strange was the fact that there was a piece of dry sun quartz in the corner next to where he had fought just now. It had been polluted even less than the one he had taken, but Yin Xingge seemed not to have noticed it at all and did not look in that direction.</p><p>He acted the same way all along the way. Yin Xingge would only attack and collect a piece of dry sun quartz when he encountered a transformed cloud beast that blocked his path.</p><p>Soon, Yin Xingge's figure suddenly stopped and halted in front of a fork in the road.</p><p>Yin Xingge looked at the fork in the road, hesitated for a moment, reached into his arms and took out a spirit beast pouch.</p><p>Glancing to the rear with caution, Yin Xingge crouched on the ground and carefully opened the spirit beast pouch. A moment later, a red line swam out of the spirit beast pouch and turned out to be a red centipede.</p><p>This centipede is not large in size, only a little longer than a normal centipede. What is strange is that its body is as crystal and clear as pyrostone. One can clearly see the fiery red thread-like flow in its body with the naked eye. It is not clear whether it is its blood or the power flowing in its body.</p><p>As soon as the centipede appeared, the air in the passage suddenly became hot. Just from its appearance, it can be determined that this centipede must be a spiritual insect, and it is not known where Yin Xingge got it.</p><p>Yin Xingge crouched there, patiently waiting for the centipede to crawl out of the spirit beast pouch, looking at its actions with anticipation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the centipede did not choose to enter any fork in the road, but suddenly turned back and crawled towards the path, lightning-fast, and then it rushed onto a piece of dry yang crystal, coiled its entire body on the surface of the dry yang crystal, opened its sharp mouthparts, and gnawed little by little on the dry yang crystal.</p><p>A trace of disappointment flashed in Yin Xingge's eyes. He lifted the spirit beast pouch and put away the centipede. Standing in front of the fork in the road, he looked left and right and chose a direction at random and rushed in.</p><p>Again and again, every time he came to a fork in the road, Yin Xingge would release the centipede. If he encountered a dead end, he would retreat and choose again, but he never found anything. Finally, he went deeper and deeper, and he was about to get out of the protection of the astrolabe. Yin Xingge had no choice but to sacrifice a cloud vessel himself.</p><p>At another fork in the road, Yin Xingge repeated his old trick and released the centipede. He didn't have much hope at first, but after the centipede crawled out of the spirit beast pouch, its upper body lifted up, as if it sensed something. It suddenly rushed into a fork in the road, like a red line, at a surprisingly fast speed, as if there was some treasure ahead attracting it.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Yin Xingge's eyes suddenly lit up, and he laughed silently. He hurriedly put away the spirit beast pouch and displayed his agility, following closely behind the centipede.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after walking for a while, it was a dead end. At the end was a rough stone wall, and there was not even a piece of dry yang crystal around. Yin Xingge stopped walking and locked his eyes on the centipede.</p>
