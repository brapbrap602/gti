<h1>Chapter 2022: True Identity</h1><p>A powerful, mysterious cultivator's battle near the Jade Gate Pass weighs heavily on everyone's minds, creating a sense of urgency.</p><p>Qin Sang suspects one of the combatants might be Tian Yue Shangren, but after a long wait, there's still no news.  Tian Yue Shangren remains missing, perhaps truly an accident.</p><p>But could this unexpected event mean an unforeseen shift in the situation at Fengju Jade Gate?  Will it affect the upcoming sword retrieval plan?</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't know; he can only focus on securing escape routes.</p><p>The next meeting is soon—they've shortened the interval to three months. Frequent meetings within the vast Fengju Jade Gate waste time traveling, but the rapidly changing situation necessitates it.</p><p>One of the three escape routes was discovered using records provided by the Xin family cultivators.  The Xin family might also uncover valuable clues, so Qin Sang personally meets with them every time.</p><p>Before the appointed day, Qin Sang takes Gu Ya towards the edge of Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>After the Jade Gate Pass battle, Qin Sang kept Gu Ya and the Zhuque and other demonic beasts close. Now, he prepares to send Gu Ya out of Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>They quickly reach an exit, where they see the boundless desert beyond. Qin Sang uses his lightning escape technique, transforming into a bolt of lightning that streaks into the sand, flying towards Jade Gate Pass.</p><p>Upon entering the city, he finds it far more deserted than when he first arrived—a desolate city, with the city lord nowhere to be seen, and chaos rampant.</p><p>Most merchant guilds are shuttered, and even some sects and families have relocated. Qin Sang visits the Five Elements Alliance's base only to find it completely abandoned, with only a message explaining the situation left behind.</p><p>Qin Sang frowns. Are these forces so pessimistic about the situation?  Could there be further unknown changes?</p><p>"This is a credential I bought while concealing my identity. Crush it, and the Beast-Riding Pavilion will send someone to escort you.  They will take you to Yin City, where you should wait for my message."</p><p>Qin Sang alters his appearance, takes out a jade talisman engraved with a spirit eagle, crushes it, and hands several talismans to Gu Ya. "These are lightning talismans I made personally. With these, almost no cultivator below the Nascent Soul stage can threaten you. They will help ensure your safe cultivation."</p><p>"Senior, why aren't you leaving with me? Can't I stay and help you?" Gu Ya, seeing Qin Sang's actions as a farewell, feels a deep unease.</p><p>She's barely met a senior cultivator who ascended from the lower realms, and now, something unexpected might happen again?</p><p>Qin Sang shakes his head. "This is a precaution. Fengju Jade Gate is volatile; if danger arises, I might not be able to protect you. Wait patiently in Yin City. Even if something happens in Fengju Jade Gate, I'll have someone find you."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>Gu Ya opens her mouth to speak, but seeing Qin Sang's resolve, she doesn't say anything more, silently accepting the talismans.</p><p>After a while, someone from the Beast-Riding Pavilion arrives.</p><p>"Business has been booming for the Beast-Riding Pavilion lately, hasn't it?" Qin Sang asks the cultivator who introduces himself as a Pavilion attendant.</p><p>The attendant beams.  "Our Pavilion has some influence throughout various parts of Dezhou. Even large factions and sects hire our people as guides.  We've moved in people from the surrounding area, but we're still short-handed…"</p><p>The chaos means a windfall for the Beast-Riding Pavilion.</p><p>"The Jade Gate Pass is in utter turmoil, everyone fleeing.  Is this truly all caused by the battle between the powerful cultivators outside?" Qin Sang presses.</p><p>"This…I am a humble individual, and I don't know the details. But from what I've seen, most people are just going with the flow. Those remaining in the city hope for stability; those who dare to take risks have already entered Fengju Jade Gate. The battle of powerful cultivators has caused widespread panic, and leaving the city is only natural," the attendant says.</p><p>Qin Sang nods silently. With the city in such disarray and no one to take charge, the strong cultivators of Jade Gate Pass likely entered Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>"She is my junior.  Please ensure her safe arrival in Yin City," Qin Sang gestures for Gu Ya to go with the attendant.</p><p>The attendant bows. "Senior, rest assured, our Pavilion will not fail you. There are other cultivators heading to Yin City; they can travel together.  Please, Miss Gu."</p><p>…</p><p>After sending Gu Ya away, Qin Sang returns to Fengju Jade Gate and reunites with the Xin family.</p><p>As soon as he sees the Xin family members, he senses a change in the atmosphere. Several Xin family cultivators are beaming, their previous gloom gone.</p><p>Even the expression of Elder Pei has softened, no longer so grim, though his gaze turns cold upon seeing Qin Sang.</p><p>"You found it?"</p><p>Qin Sang looks towards the carriage.</p><p>It's obvious. Only one thing could cause such a change in the Xin family's mood.</p><p>The steward, Lao Luo, rushed forward, repeatedly saying, "Elder Qin, the talisman fires under Xin Kui's command are acting strangely. We're not certain what's happening, and the young master needs you to confirm it in person."</p><p>"Eight years of searching, and finally we've found it. Quite the feat.  It seems you've all been waiting for me. Let's go then."</p><p>Qin Sang leaped onto the carriage, settling into a cross-legged position behind the jade desk.</p><p>The carriage shuddered slightly, leaving a streak across the void like a shooting star, its aura gradually fading as it sped silently away.</p><p>Various mystical scenes flashed past, and after observing for a moment, Qin Sang turned to the quiet chamber, asking,  "Young Master Xin, what exactly needs to be refined?  You can tell me now."</p><p>From behind the curtains, Young Master Xin bowed slightly, "Once we confirm the location, we'll find it quickly. Then we will inform Elder Qin. Please be patient."</p><p>Pei, the attendant, chuckled, "Elder Qin, do you lack even a little patience?  Pei has been kept in the dark for many years by their mysterious behavior."</p><p>This sounded like a sarcastic jab at Qin Sang, but also a hint.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred. Young Master Xin's actions were certainly peculiar.</p><p>Xin was no fool; inviting Qin Sang and Pei to counterbalance each other was plausible. But Qin Sang doubted Xin dared to attack them both.</p><p>Refining Void cultivators weren’t easily tricked, especially not two at once.  Playing with fire was dangerous.</p><p>However, Pei didn't seem generous. His tolerance of the Xin family for so long suggested either they possessed something he feared, or a significant benefit motivated his patience.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang didn't want to get involved, he habitually analyzed everyone's words and actions. Better safe than sorry.</p><p>While Qin Sang pondered, the carriage fell silent. After a journey, they finally reached the waiting Xin family cultivators.</p><p>"Greetings, Young Master!"</p><p>The Xin cultivators bowed.</p><p>Xin Kui stepped forward, pointing to a cluster of multicolored lights. "Young Master, look.  The talisman fires showed slight changes nearby. We pinpointed the source of the anomaly to within these strange lights.  We didn't dare act without knowing the dangers inside, so we await your decision."</p><p>Young Master Xin hummed, took out a yellow talisman, and steered the carriage towards the strange lights.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>A red light appeared from behind the curtains, gradually revealing a green hue.</p><p>Everyone watched the curtains tensely.  Young Master Xin let out a long breath, his voice filled with excitement, "This is it!"</p><p>A cheer erupted.</p><p>"Elder Qin, Senior Pei, please wait here. I'll fetch the rest of the Xin family cultivators.  Luo, you stay behind and lead Xin Kui and the others to scout ahead…"</p><p>Young Master Xin acted decisively, immediately making arrangements and speeding off in the carriage.</p><p>Steward Luo coordinated, deploying the Xin cultivators in several teams. They formed battle formations, raised their treasures, and cautiously probed the strange lights, advancing and retreating with skill.</p><p>Qin Sang and Pei had nothing to do and didn't intend to intervene, watching from the sidelines.</p><p>"These lights don't seem too dangerous, Elder Qin. Why not make a move and avoid wasting time?" Pei transmitted his voice.</p><p>"I'm an outsider. If anyone should act, it should be you, Pei. Besides, I only agreed to refine items for Young Master Xin. Other matters don't concern me," Qin Sang replied indifferently, unmoved.</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Pei's voice was deep, "I wonder if Daoist Qin will remain so unmoved once he sees the Xin family's secret."</p><p>"Oh? I'm curious indeed. What secret warrants such a mobilization?  You seem to know, Pei.  Is it a vast treasure? If it includes the Earthly Splendor Jade Vine, I might not be able to resist asking Young Master Xin for a piece," Qin Sang looked at Pei with interest.</p><p>"It's merely speculation! As you've seen, Daoist Qin, this Xin family young master is very tight-lipped."</p><p>Pei's eyes flashed, and he laughed it off.</p><p>He was suspicious. Did this Qin Sang truly know nothing, merely invited to refine items?</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Pei's suspicions but didn't comment.  This was all Young Master Xin's doing, carefully setting the stage.  Pei already viewed him as a rival; explanations were pointless. Seeing is believing.</p><p>As they ventured deeper into the strange lights, Young Master Xin returned with the others.  Once everyone was assembled, they took turns leading the way, significantly increasing their speed.</p><p>Initially, the strange lights were scattered, a chaotic mixture of colors.  As they went deeper, the lights solidified, their colors becoming purer.</p><p>Beams of light, large and small, shot out from within, densely packed; some harmless, others menacing, interconnected and potentially explosive.</p><p>They continued for a while. Qin Sang sensed something, her expression shifting slightly. She glanced at Pei Gongfeng, who remained calm.  Suddenly, a commotion erupted ahead.</p><p>At the forefront of the battle formation was Xin Kui, a Nascent Soul cultivator, leading the way. He wore a jade crown that emitted a radiant glow, offering protection and repeatedly saving him from danger.  Moments ago, Xin Kui used the crown to deflect strange rays of light, when without warning, a bloody hole appeared on his left shoulder.  Something pierced his shoulder, leaving only a gaping wound.  Before anyone could react, Xin Kui’s abdomen was also pierced.</p><p>"Invisible light! Retreat!" Xin Shaozu shouted.</p><p>Xin Kui immediately retreated without hesitation.</p><p>Two Yuan Ying cultivators closest to Xin Kui also suffered injuries; one was fatally wounded.  Despite his cultivation, Xin Kui was drenched in sweat, enduring unimaginable pain from the relatively minor wounds. The fatally wounded cultivator swayed, his breath rapidly fading.</p><p>Luo Guanjia rushed to his side, producing a jade bottle and feeding the cultivator all the pills inside. "Quickly circulate your energy and calm down!"</p><p>With a final surge of strength, the cultivator sat cross-legged and meditated, his face twitching occasionally, but he managed to survive.</p><p>"A terrifyingly strange and violent power!" Xin Kui gasped, forcing out the residual energy from his wounds.</p><p>The Xin family stopped and conferred before continuing, but soon more suffered severe injuries, only surviving thanks to Luo Guanjia's timely treatment.</p><p>The danger was invisible, mixed with various strange lights, making it impossible to guard against.  At this rate, before they reached their destination, many Xin family cultivators would perish in this area.</p><p>Facing this, Xin Shaozu made a decision.  "All Yuan Ying cultivators, retreat!"</p><p>"But…"</p><p>A look of hesitation crossed Luo Guanjia's face, and he looked behind him.</p><p>At the rear of the group, Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng followed leisurely, side-by-side, letting the others lead the way.</p><p>Luo Guanjia knew that either of them could easily resolve the situation. Yet, they showed no intention of intervening, watching as the Xin family fell into crisis.</p><p>For this mission, the Xin family had painstakingly created a formation array, operated by their cultivators using their unique techniques, capable of unleashing several powerful attacks. While not enough to kill a Void Refinement cultivator, it was their confidence in facing Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng.</p><p>The large array required the Yuan Ying cultivators.  Their retreat would significantly reduce manpower, essentially weakening the Xin family before they even reached their goal.</p><p>The formation array, once deployed, could not be retracted and was purely offensive, unsuitable for the current situation.</p><p>Luo Guanjia wondered if the two were deliberately weakening the Xin family, perhaps having foreseen something.</p><p>The weak are helpless against the strong; sometimes, the strong don't even need to act.</p><p>Luo Guanjia sighed, deeply frustrated, "You wait outside and remain vigilant."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>All the Yuan Ying cultivators withdrew, leaving only the Xin family's Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Soon, even the Nascent Soul cultivators started getting injured, with Xin Kui's injuries forcing him to withdraw for treatment.</p><p>The remaining Xin family members dwindled, their expressions grave, the earlier excitement gone.</p><p>Qin Sang had been observing the strange lights. She noticed the carriage ahead stopped.</p><p>The carriage had shrunk repeatedly throughout the journey; now, only a small chamber remained, suggesting it could not contract further.</p><p>A jade hand lifted the curtain, and Xin Shaozu slowly stepped out.</p><p>Qin Sang saw Xin Shaozu’s face for the first time and looked curiously. Xin Shaozu was delicate and graceful, like a young woman, wearing a half-mask. Her visible skin was flawless, and her eyes were like autumn water; both her appearance and bearing were exceptional.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng's gaze sharpened upon seeing Xin Shaozu, but his expression remained unchanged.</p>
