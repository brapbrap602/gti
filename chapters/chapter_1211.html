<h1>Chapter 1203: The Demon King Appears (Extra chapter for alliance leader Nan Wang Wang Wang!)</h1><p>The tremors grew increasingly frequent.</p><p>Each one more violent than the last.</p><p>“The strongest tremor is coming!”</p><p>Gao Guan Dao Ren said in a low voice, his true energy surging from his palm, activating the spirit array. The white-haired elder did the same.</p><p>The other cultivators assisted the two grandmasters, equally vigilant.</p><p>The luminous barrier above the void suddenly shone brightly, appearing incredibly thick.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Everyone felt as if their minds had been struck by a heavy hammer!</p><p>A formless wave suddenly erupted from the void, bursting from the darkness and violently striking the barrier.</p><p>The barrier dimmed.</p><p>The immense impact spread outwards, shaking the entire Sky Scar. The cultivators swayed, but held their ground, continuing to activate the spirit array.</p><p>The tremors came quickly and faded just as fast.</p><p>The barrier remained intact, quickly regaining its brightness.</p><p>But the tremors were far from over.  A second wave followed immediately, then a third, a fourth…</p><p>Later, they almost merged into one continuous assault, leaving the cultivators no time to breathe.  Within the Abyssal Ruins, an incredibly powerful and violent force raged, attempting to break free from the void.</p><p>Despite their combined efforts in activating the spirit array, the luminous barrier firmly sealed the void, repelling the waves.</p><p>However, the tremors still spread, causing spatial instability and extreme chaotic spiritual energy, forming a storm akin to a minor spiritual tide, impacting the surrounding area.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>No one knew when the tremors would cease.</p><p>At that moment, in the north of the Abyssal Ruins entrance, three figures silently appeared from a narrow crack in the rock, slowly drifting downwards.</p><p>The storm caused by the tremors swept over them, the chaotic spiritual energy raging in a chaotic torrent.</p><p>Surrounding these three figures was a wisp of green energy. The storm surged towards them, but the green energy swayed gently, causing the storm to slide harmlessly past them.</p><p>The source of the green energy was a green flag held by one of the figures.</p><p>This person wore white robes, possessed handsome features, and was strikingly handsome.</p><p>A small, square green flag danced before him, one side depicting clusters of green clouds, while the other constantly shifted, its pattern indecipherable.</p><p>“Thanks to Daoist Lu’s Myriad Green Clouds Flag, otherwise sneaking into this place unnoticed amidst the spiritual tide would have required a great deal more effort…”</p><p>A voice beside him complimented the white-robed flag-bearer, revealing the man's surname to be Lu.</p><p>The voice belonged to a bizarre being, half-human, half-snake—the Serpent King!</p><p>On Lu's other side stood a slender young man. The young man’s eyes were a pure ice-blue, his gaze icy cold, and his ears were shaped like two fan-shaped membranes, clearly not human.</p><p>The young man was a transformed Great Demon of the Frost Lizard species, his Daoist name also Frost Lizard.</p><p>However, Lu, a human cultivator, possessed an aura that was in no way inferior to the Serpent King’s.</p><p>These three had come together to explore the ancient Great Demon's cave. They had not arrived just now, but had waited nearby for nearly a month, specifically awaiting the tremors from the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>“Daoist Serpent King, there’s no need for false modesty, I don't believe you lack such abilities.”</p><p>Lu chuckled, his gaze shifting to the depths of the crack. “Without Daoist Frost Lizard’s guidance, I wouldn't have even known where the ancient prohibitions were. It's no wonder the Sin Abyss cultivators pass here daily without noticing. The tremors of the Sin God Palace are most intense in the first few waves, masking our disruption of the prohibitions. Once these few waves pass, and they regain their senses, concealment will be difficult. If we alarm those two old fellows and trigger the grand array’s attack, we'll have to flee.  If we fail this time, we’ll have to wait for the next tremor in half a year. If the Sin Abyss retreats in the meantime, and those Nascent Soul old ghosts all return, we'll have to wait even longer, until the Sin God Palace appears.”</p><p>The Great Demon's cave they sought was near the Abyssal Ruins, hence their extreme caution.</p><p>“By then, this King will definitely visit the Purple Micro Palace.”</p><p>The Serpent King shook his head.  The importance of the Purple Micro Palace compared to this place was self-evident. He sighed softly, “It’s a pity that Daoist Mingyue is unwilling to take the risk.  If Daoist Mingyue were here with her Sky Eye Butterflies, breaking the ancient prohibitions would be foolproof.”</p><p>Frost Lizard sneered, “There’s a human saying: ‘To each their own.’  She doesn't care for the treasures of an ancient Great Demon. Can we complain? Our carefully collected prohibition-breaking methods are no worse than her Sky Eye Butterflies.”</p><p>As he spoke, Frost Lizard vanished, reappearing inside the crack, holding a piece of what appeared to be a spirit beast's hide. He gently waved it towards the wall.</p><p>A gigantic ancient vine shadow, seemingly extending from the stone wall, appeared silently on the wall.  Thick as a dragon, it coiled and hung down.</p><p>The vine's image was both real and illusory, flickering slightly before threatening to shatter.</p><p>The Serpent King’s expression was grave.  “Fellow cultivator, are you certain the great demon's lair is hidden within the Abyssal Ruins?”</p><p>“Almost certainly. This ancient vine grows from nothingness; where else could it be but the Abyssal Ruins?”</p><p>Han Xi nodded. “It's said that since the frequent premature appearances of the Sinful God Palace and the Ziwei Palace, some previously unbreakable prohibitions and seals within the Abyssal Ruins have either shattered under the shockwaves or become weakened and unstable.  The Sinful Abyss has reaped quite a harvest. I fear that if we wait too long, the Sinful Abyss will discover this lair.”</p><p>“If we can connect to the Abyssal Ruins and control this passage, we can get a share of the spoils. But it's too early to say.  Disturbing the Abyssal Ruins would be a huge problem. Be careful, both of you.”</p><p>With these words, the Lu cultivator flicked his sleeve, summoning eighty-one glittering golden three-inch needles – a set of magical tools specifically designed for breaking prohibitions.</p><p>Han Xi spat out a blue bead.  Snowflakes swirled within it, a miniature blizzard world. Amid the chaos, these snowflakes gradually condensed into a perfect replica of the vine shadow on the wall, mimicking the ancient vine prohibition to find a way to break it.</p><p>The Serpent King's actions were the most unusual.</p><p>He first took out several vials of differently colored spiritual liquids, manipulating them until they merged, forming a dazzling, multicolored bead in mid-air. He then flicked it into his forehead.</p><p>His brow split open, the bead embedding itself, like a newly opened third eye.</p><p>Each of the three displayed their unique abilities, employing secret techniques and magical artifacts.  Their figures flickered, landing on one of the vine's leaves.</p><p>The vine shadow swayed and shattered, and the three figures dissipated like water.</p><p>Subsequently, sporadic, erratic fluctuations emanated from that space, but were masked by the tremors of the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>…</p><p>Tian Shi Sect headquarters.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the grand hall, diligently comprehending the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>Suddenly, without warning, a wave crashed upon him.</p><p>The protective divine energy around Qin Sang shimmered, launching him high into the air.  He looked down at the suddenly agitated water with a surprised expression.</p><p>He had been peacefully cultivating his swordsmanship and refining the ebony sword here, and this was the first time anything like this had happened.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was filled with doubt and uncertainty…</p><p>The waves rose again, and the sealing power in the water began to violently shake.</p><p>Qin Sang realized the source was the sealed space!</p><p>In an instant, enormous waves surged, the entire secret realm violently shaking.</p>
