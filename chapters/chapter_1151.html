<h1>Chapter 1143: The Azure Phoenix</h1><p>The falcon demon knocked out the Demon King's favored concubine. It glanced around, then folded its wings, summoning bolts of lightning that silently converged in the air, forming a silvery-white sphere of thunder. Inside the sphere, countless thin lightning bolts danced incessantly.</p><p>The falcon demon muttered incantations, and with a sudden motion, the thunder sphere plummeted toward the ground.</p><p>"It's definitely here!" the falcon demon exclaimed triumphantly. "I sensed something nearby that stirred the thunderous power in my bloodline. Who would have thought that Demon King Qianji's treasure vault would be hidden in his concubine's abode?"</p><p>The falcon demon carefully inspected the area but found nothing unusual. Its spiritual sense swept over the surroundings, detecting no fluctuations or traces of any restrictions. Guided by the thunder sphere, it finally discovered an extremely well-hidden entrance. The ground beneath the jade bed silently split open, revealing a set of stairs.</p><p>"That old demon is truly cunning, using mortal mechanisms!" the falcon demon cursed under its breath before darting into the passage.</p><p>The passage was deep, leading straight underground. It wasn't dark inside, as the walls were lined with luminous pearls. At the end of the passage stood a stone door, faintly glowing with a mysterious lightâ€”clearly a restriction left by Demon King Qianji. Pressed for time, the falcon demon's eyes flickered with urgency as it hurried forward, focusing on breaking the restriction.</p><p>Just then, a voice suddenly rang out from behind, "Thank you, fellow cultivator, for helping me find the treasure vault."</p><p>In an instant, the falcon demon's feathers stood on end. Someone had been lurking behind it, and it hadn't noticed at all!</p><p>"Who's there?!" the falcon demon cried out in terror. Without a second thought, it summoned a thick bolt of lightning from its body, hurling it toward the source of the voice.</p><p>As it turned around, the falcon demon was met with a sight that filled it with despair. A masked figure with azure wings stood behind it, having appeared out of nowhere. The figure didn't dodge the lightning attack but simply raised a hand, channeling true essence into its palm, effortlessly catching the bolt of lightning. The figure's body only swayed slightly from the impact.</p><p>In the next moment, a flash of sword light illuminated the area. A terrifying sword aura descended, shaking the falcon demon to its core. Before it could react, the surrounding space was sealed by a sword formation. Countless sword lights trembled in the air, their tips all pointing directly at the falcon demon.</p><p>Trapped within the sword formation, the falcon demon's eyes widened in terror. Although its opponent wasn't a fully transformed demon, its strength was overwhelming. The falcon demon had no doubt that the slightest movement would result in being pierced by a thousand swords.</p><p>"Sword aura! You're a human?" the falcon demon cried out in shock.</p><p>It had heard rumors that the most talented human sword cultivators could comprehend sword aura even at the Golden Core stage, making them fearsome opponents. Now, it had witnessed this firsthand and realized it stood no chance.</p><p>"Fellow cultivator, don't act rashly. Out of gratitude for helping me find this treasure, I have no intention of harming you. But if you make any sudden moves, things might get messy," Qin Sang said calmly, sending out a streak of light to seal the falcon demon's cultivation.</p><p>The falcon demon felt a mix of shame and anger. The human had thrown its own words back at it, the same ones it had used on the Demon King's concubine earlier. Its eyes darted around, no longer concerned with the treasure but only with how to escape from this human's grasp. Though the human claimed not to want its life, the falcon demon knew there were fates worse than death.</p><p>Qin Sang paid no attention to the falcon demon's thoughts. He suspected it might be Fat Chicken, but there was no time to confirm. If it was indeed Fat Chicken, it would have extensive knowledge of the Endless Valley. Once he had the chance, he could return to the valley to search for the Blood Mulberry of the Abyss. He wondered how this creature had ended up here and where its elders had gone.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered how Fat Chicken had been at the demon spirit stage right after hatching, giving him a hard time back then. Now, he had easily captured it.</p><p>With the help of his Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang examined the restrictions on the stone door, identifying their weak points. After some effort, he finally broke through the restrictions and pushed the door open.</p><p>"Ha!"</p><p>The sight of the treasures inside the vault made Qin Sang's eyes widen. The most valuable items were undoubtedly carried by Demon King Qianji himself, but the vault was filled with chests of mid-grade spirit stones. Behind them stood rows of wooden shelves, laden with various magical artifacts.</p><p>The artifacts radiated a dazzling light, though their quality wasn't exceptionally high. They were items the Demon King no longer used but couldn't bear to discard. For a Golden Core cultivator, they would be priceless treasures. Each artifact bore restrictions placed by the Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't distracted by the wealth. His gaze quickly swept across the room until it landed on a square stone slab on one of the shelves. It matched Senior Sister Qingjun's description perfectly.</p><p>"This is it!" Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy as he hurried to the shelf, his eyes fixed on the stone slab.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's interest in the stone slab, the falcon demon, now immobilized at the entrance, was shocked. It realized that the object that had drawn it here was this very slab!</p><p>The stone slab was protected by multiple layers of restrictions, clearly indicating its importance to Demon King Qianji. After studying the restrictions, Qin Sang found their weaknesses and carefully began to dismantle them, channeling his true essence into the slab to activate the Azure Phoenix's phantom.</p><p>Layer by layer, the restrictions were broken. Finally, the true form of the stone slab was revealed. Its surface was uneven, a dull grayish-white, lying quietly on the shelf. There was no sign of the Azure Phoenix's phantom, making it appear no different from an ordinary slab.</p><p>Having obtained it so easily, Qin Sang decided to take the slab and leave the Serpent Abyss immediately. He didn't want to risk activating the Azure Phoenix's phantom here, fearing unforeseen consequences.</p><p>However, the moment his fingers touched the slab, an unexpected change occurred. A layer of azure light suddenly emanated from the slab, wrapping around Qin Sang's fingers and rapidly flowing into his body.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He had no idea what this azure light was, and Senior Sister Qingjun had never mentioned anything like this happening.</p><p>"Not good!" Qin Sang thought in panic.</p><p>Whether the azure light was beneficial or harmful, he couldn't allow it to enter his body without understanding its nature. Reacting swiftly, he withdrew his hand and frantically channeled his true essence, trying to stop the light from spreading.</p><p>Suddenly, with a deafening explosion, the stone slab shattered into pieces. Amid the flying debris and dust, the phantom of an Azure Phoenix spread its wings and soared into the air, releasing an awe-inspiring aura unlike anything Qin Sang had ever felt.</p><p>The treasure vault now felt incredibly cramped as the Azure Phoenix's phantom circled slightly before lowering its head to gaze at Qin Sang. It was as if they were facing a true celestial beast. The falcon demon trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>With a piercing cry, the Azure Phoenix's phantom transformed into a streak of azure light and shot into Qin Sang's body without warning.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang felt as though he had been transported to a primordial world. He saw a vast, desolate landscape, with an Azure Phoenix soaring through thunderclouds, completely unfazed by the terrifying bolts of lightning!</p>
