<h1>Chapter 1419 Slave Dao Divine Power </h1><p>A descendant of the Wu Clan.</p><p>The Wu Clan!</p><p>A flash of lightning crossed Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>So that's how it is!</p><p>The Ghost Mother is very likely to be a great power of the ancient Wu Clan.</p><p>A dignified great power of the Wu Clan, living to this era, instead of slumbering in the Wu God Continent, she came to a place without the Wu Clan. After awakening, she was sealed by Tianyue Shangren , and almost perished.</p><p>Qin Sang really didn't know whether to say that the Ghost Mother's luck was good or bad.</p><p>No wonder Hundred Flower Valley has the inheritance of the Wu Clan.</p><p>This kind of improvement, even Qin Sang, who also cultivates Natal Insect Gu, couldn't do it. It turned out to be from the hands of a great power of the Wu Clan!</p><p>No wonder the founder of Hundred Flower Valley came from the Sky Spirit Sea.</p><p>The founder of Hundred Flower Valley was likely a disciple the Ghost Mother took in the beginning.</p><p>No, not necessarily a disciple.</p><p>Perhaps the Ghost Mother had just awakened and was in a weakened state, so she casually guided a few people to do things for her. Otherwise, she wouldn't have watched her disciples go astray.</p><p>A casual act brought about a famous sect that shook the Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>He had to go through Hundred Flower Valley to find the Insect Manipulation Secret Art. Discovering the Insect Manipulation Secret Art in Hundred Flower Valley and coming to the Sky Spirit Sea to investigate was inevitable, only a matter of time.</p><p>If he had been a step slower, he would have missed Tan Hao.</p><p>Conversely, he could have met the Ghost Mother sooner.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh at the trickery of fate.</p><p>He had a descendant of the Wu Clan that the Ghost Mother was looking for right by his side.</p><p>He didn't know what the Ghost Mother's purpose was, but the Wu Clan descendant was definitely extremely important to her. Without Qin Sang having to say much, the Ghost Mother would do everything in her power to awaken Ya Gu .</p><p>Yet, he perfectly missed the Ghost Mother!</p><p>"The inheritance of the Heavenly Corpse Sect is not entirely the Corpse Dao . The Heavenly Corpse Talisman was created by Senior Ghost Mother to improve the Heavenly Corpse Sect's strength as quickly as possible. It combined the Corpse Dao of the Human race and simplified a top-tier Slave Dao Divine Power of the Wu Clan, which is why it has such miraculous effects. If I could have found Senior earlier, there might have been a chance to save Tan Jie, but it was too late. He had completely fallen, and Senior tried several times but failed..."</p><p>Tan Hao only hated that his cultivation was too weak back then, missing the opportunity.</p><p>"So it's a Slave Dao Divine Power."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, everything made sense.</p><p>This was the Ghost Mother's style, improving the Natal Insect Gu and the Slave Dao one after another, to make them suitable for Human race cultivation.</p><p>That's right, there's also the Bone Curse, similar to divine runes!</p><p>Living corpses aren't 'corpses', but corpse slaves, no wonder the Heavenly Corpse Talisman is engraved in the nascent soul.</p><p>Presumably, the complete Slave Dao Divine Power must have a great origin. The simplified Heavenly Corpse Talisman can be cast by low-level cultivators, forcibly controlling cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>However, the Wu Clan of the Canglang  Sea didn't seem to understand the Slave Dao, otherwise, he would have discovered the clues.</p><p>Perhaps they lost this part of the inheritance.</p><p>Slave Dao, Natal Insect Gu, Divine Runes—the Wu Clan inheritance is truly exceptionally strange.</p><p>Hmm, very barbaric.</p><p>No… it's primitive, but also closer to nature.</p><p>Qin Sang had an impression of the Wu Clan in his heart, and asked: "Did Senior Ghost Mother say what the purpose of finding the Wu Clan descendant was?"</p><p>Tan Hao recalled: "It seems she mentioned something about, the bloodline of the Wu Clan is enough... to help her return."</p><p>Return, what does that mean?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of the Ascension Platform, as well as Bai, Senior Sister, and Old Devil Ye who had left.</p><p>Great powers of the Wu Clan are also contending.</p><p>She needs the Wu Clan bloodline, could it be to obtain guidance from beyond the world? If he really finds the Ghost Mother, will it be good or bad for Ya Gu?</p><p>All sorts of possibilities flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The Ghost Mother has gone far away, and there is no way to verify it.</p><p>Missing this opportunity, it will be difficult to find the Ghost Mother again.</p><p>Central Continent.</p><p>It sounds simple, and there might also be Wu Clan there. Will the Ghost Mother return to the North Sea after achieving her goal, or will she directly return?</p><p>If he goes to the Central Continent...</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't optimistic.</p><p>He wasn't willing to stop here. Now that he knows about the Central Continent, and the North Sea also has sea charts leading there, he will definitely go there to find a way to escape the cage and explore the truth of this world.</p><p>But this will have to wait hundreds of years.</p><p>First, he has to find a way to obtain the sea charts, and then he has to have enough strength to protect himself in the Storm Belt.</p><p>The Central Continent is bound to be far away.</p><p>Qin Sang has to take such a big risk from the North Chen Realm to the North Sea. He has to wait until at least the Nascent Soul Late Stage before he dares to set off. If it's too far away, and there are no clear shelters on the sea charts, he might even have to wait until after the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Divine Transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang really didn't dare to expect it.</p><p>Can Ya Gu last until then?</p><p>He no longer has the Three Lights Jade Dew in his hands. If he can't find a substitute spirit medicine for a long time, even if Ya Gu's nascent soul can be maintained under the nourishment of the Soul Nourishing Wood, her body will lose its vitality and completely turn into a corpse.</p><p>"What method did Senior Ghost Mother use when saving Tan Jie?"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked.</p><p>As he spoke, he summoned Ya Gu.</p><p>Tan Hao glanced at Ya Gu, then at Qin Sang, not delving into their relationship, and stared at her for a while, saying, "Senior once said that the Heavenly Corpse Talisman she created isn't perfect. It's easy to form but difficult to break. She needs to use the Wu Clan's top-tier Slave Dao Secret Art to carefully break it. Otherwise, it's easy to overdo it and cause an irreparable situation. Senior also waited until she returned to the North Sea and her strength recovered before daring to take action."</p><p>Tan Hao's words made Qin Sang even heavier.</p><p>The bigger the origin of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, the smaller the possibility of Ya Gu waking up on her own.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Tan Hao looked at Ya Gu, revealing a surprised expression, "How long has she been asleep?"</p><p>Qin Sang said: "More than two and a half centuries."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Tan Hao exclaimed, "Not much later than Tan Jie, how did you keep her in such good condition?"</p><p>Three Lights Jade Dew, Soul Nourishing Wood, and a spirit insect of unknown origin took the initiative to recognize her as master.</p><p>Qin Sang silently recited, suddenly realizing that, compared to Tan Jie, Ya Gu's luck was simply heaven-defying.</p><p>So many treasures used on her, there should be some difference, right?</p><p>Seeing Tan Hao's expression, Qin Sang hurriedly asked: "What did Brother Tan see?"</p><p>Tan Hao recalled the bad memories, and said in a low voice, "Back then, after Brother Qin left, I always carried Tan Jie with me. The corpse aura quickly polluted his body, and that crystal coffin could only delay it for a while. Fortunately, Tan Jie's nascent soul didn't dissipate. Although his consciousness was blurred, he could still feel it, so I still had a glimmer of hope. But as time went on, I discovered strange changes in his nascent soul, it became... stiff, deathly silent, his consciousness became more and more blurred, and finally completely silent. After meeting Senior Ghost Mother, she first used some methods to try to nourish his nascent soul and awaken some of his consciousness, but it was all in vain. If I had met Brother Qin earlier, the result might have been different."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how to comfort Tan Hao.</p><p>He still had a few Soul Nourishing Wood tablets in his hand, and it wouldn't hurt to take one out.</p><p>But the plump silkworm that took the initiative to recognize its master, which could serve as an anchor in the mortal world, didn't have a second one.</p><p>Qin Sang had a hunch that Ya Gu was in such good condition, and the most important thing was probably not the Soul Nourishing Wood, but the plump silkworm!</p><p>After being silent for a while, Tan Hao suddenly reached into his pocket and took out a round jade pendant.</p><p>"This was personally refined by Senior when she sneaked into the Xuan Tian  Palace, and given to me as a warning item. It contains a trace of Senior's divine sense. If we can still meet Senior, she should be able to sense it."</p><p>"If you have the opportunity, you must save her!"</p><p>"You must!"</p><p>Tan Hao's gaze moved from Tan Jie's tombstone to Qin Sang, and solemnly handed him the jade pendant.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks to the almighty 'Temperament Wandering' for the Alliance Master reward.</p><p>The debt is getting bigger and bigger, so hurry up and pay off one chapter first.</p>
