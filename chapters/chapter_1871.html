<h1>Chapter 1862: Summoning Soldiers with Scattered Beans</h1><p>Zuo Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren were acquainted, but there was a layer of separation between them and Qin Sang. Relying solely on this connection, Qin Sang couldn't fully trust the other party.</p><p>If Zuo Zhenren's goal was to have him continuously wear down Ling Youwang, then seize the opportunity to strike, it would inevitably force a deadly battle between him and Ling Youwang.</p><p>Even if he could ultimately slay Ling Youwang, Qin Sang's condition wouldn't be optimistic.  Facing Zuo Zhenren alone, if Zuo Zhenren harbored malicious intent, how could he protect himself?</p><p>Given the current situation, he might have a chance to escape Ling Youwang, making such a risk unnecessary.</p><p>However, among the three parties, he was the weakest. Some things wouldn't unfold according to his will.</p><p>How to navigate between the two powerhouses and preserve himself required careful consideration.</p><p>Qin Sang was pondering this when he heard Zuo Zhenren calmly say, "Such old demons are extremely vigilant and cunning. Any anomaly will alert them. Unless it's a long-laid plan, it's difficult to lure them into a trap. In the end, a direct confrontation is inevitable. There's no need for you to fight to the death with the old demon. I'll make some arrangements. Just follow my instructions."</p><p>Zuo Zhenren seemed to have discerned Qin Sang's thoughts and had no intention of using him as bait.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved.</p><p>Of course, he also understood that while Zuo Zhenren's words held some truth, depleting Ling Youwang's strength further would certainly not be a bad thing.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren didn't choose the most assured approach, clearly considering his concerns. He was conveying that he didn't regard him as a pawn but as a collaborator, demonstrating his sincerity.</p><p>Nothing in the world is perfect. Zuo Zhenren clearly understood the art of compromise. Ling Youwang had been pursuing Qin Sang, and his own strength had also been depleted to a certain extent. The priority now was to gain Qin Sang's trust.</p><p>This proposal was one Qin Sang couldn't refuse.</p><p>Whether or not Ling Youwang was ultimately slain, his crisis would be resolved. It was advantageous for him with no drawbacks.</p><p>After a pause, Zuo Zhenren added, "The Ghostfang Kingdom is a great threat to the Daoist sects. The Demon King's hands are stained with the blood of our fellow Daoists. If Fellow Daoist assists me in slaying this fiend, I will definitely report your meritorious service to the Dao Court upon my return. When rewards are bestowed, this fiend can be considered a true Demon King. Whatever Fellow Daoist desires, the Dao Court will strive to fulfill..."</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>It was common knowledge that the Dao Court always rewarded meritorious deeds, regardless of background, and was never stingy.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't say for sure how great the merit of slaying a Demon King was, but even a small portion of the reward would be unimaginable for ordinary cultivators.</p><p>His "Demonic Transformation" technique had reached the late Fifth Transformation.  Although his "Spirit and Sword Nurturing Chapter" was at the mid-Eleventh Level, after this battle, advancing to the late stage was just around the corner.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang would have to plan for his breakthrough to the Void Refinement stage, but his understanding of this stage was almost nonexistent, and he had no master to guide him.</p><p>Taking this opportunity to connect with the Dao Court and become acquainted with a Grand True Person was a rare opportunity.  It would be even more wonderful if he could receive personal guidance from a Grand True Person.</p><p>Furthermore, slaying a formidable foe like Ling Youwang would be immensely beneficial for his future comprehension of the Killing Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a reason to refuse.  Of course, necessary caution was still required.  After pondering for a moment, he agreed.</p><p>Receiving a response, Zuo Zhenren fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. He focused his mind, concentrating on dealing with Ling Youwang's relentless attacks.</p><p>The subtle struggle continued.</p><p>Outside the celestial barrier.</p><p>After securing Qin Sang's cooperation, Zuo Zhenren flipped his right palm, and a jade bowl materialized in his hand.</p><p>The jade bowl was flatter than ordinary bowls, crafted from a type of black jade, incredibly translucent.</p><p>The bowl was empty.</p><p>Holding the jade bowl in one hand, Zuo Zhenren raised his other arm, shaking his sleeve. Specks of golden light flew out, scattering into the bowl.</p><p>A series of clinking sounds followed as the golden light dissipated, revealing grains of soybeans. These soybeans, however, were rounder and fuller than ordinary ones, their surfaces seemingly gilded with a layer of gold foil, shimmering with luster.</p><p>There were perhaps dozens of soybeans.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren held the jade bowl before him, gazing at it for a moment, then gently rotated his wrist.</p><p>A faint splashing sound was heard.</p><p>Looking into the jade bowl again, it was now filled with clear water.</p><p>The soybeans soaked in the water. With a stream of tiny bubbles, the water was absorbed, and the skins of the soybeans cracked, as if they were sprouting roots and leaves in an instant.</p><p>However, the soybeans didn't sprout. Instead, a bizarre scene unfolded.  All the soybeans sprouted limbs and heads.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half the bowl of soybeans transformed into golden figures the size of soybeans, clad in golden armor, wielding weapons.  They were clearly miniature golden warriors.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren flicked his fingers, shooting a divine talisman into the bowl.  It split into specks of flowing light, merging into the foreheads of the golden figures.</p><p>The golden figures abruptly opened their eyes, radiating vitality, coming to life.</p><p>With a rustling sound, they spontaneously formed ranks in the bowl, saluting Zuo Zhenren in unison.</p><p>A fierce aura, though restrained, emanated from them. No one would dare underestimate these bean-sized golden warriors.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren stroked his beard, smiling. Although he didn't command armies, he was proficient in the art of imbuing spirits and deploying formations—the art of summoning soldiers with scattered beans!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, be careful!"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren looked down at the ground, transmitting his voice to warn Qin Sang.  He flipped his palm, inverting the jade bowl.</p><p>In the jungle.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. Suddenly, he abandoned his defensive stance and charged forward.</p><p>Just then, two long whiskers lashed towards him. Qin Sang saw two streaks of white light crisscrossing before him, coming with ferocious momentum. Yet, he showed no intention of dodging.  He reached out with both hands, attempting to grasp the whiskers with his bare palms.</p><p>The whiskers were incredibly swift.</p><p>With the aid of his Celestial Eye, Qin Sang accurately captured the trajectory of the whiskers, grasping their ends with lightning speed.</p><p>The whiskers felt like slippery icicles in his hands, difficult to grip. He felt a terrifying impact force surge through them, slamming into his palms.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, his arms in excruciating pain. Ignoring the pain, he tightened his grip, desperately clutching the ends of the whiskers.</p><p>Seeing his unusual actions, Ling Youwang's heart skipped a beat, inexplicably filled with unease.</p><p>Moreover, Ling Youwang noticed that the surrounding starlight suddenly grew brighter.</p><p>As Qin Sang moved, the stars shifted.  The center of the star river was directly above Ling Youwang's head.  The sword formation underwent a dramatic transformation.</p><p>It was still the same sword formation, but its range had drastically shrunk, the starlight was sharper, the star river more compact, and the sword momentum more concentrated!</p><p>The stars shifted, their light reaching the heavens, as if a ferocious tiger was about to pounce.  The formation's momentum was unpredictable.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Specks of golden light pierced through the celestial barrier.  Initially only the size of beans, they rapidly expanded as they plummeted downwards.</p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p>Ling Youwang roared furiously.</p><p>The Blackfish Dharma Idol violently shook its head, its long whiskers flashing with a dazzling white light. The ends of the whiskers erupted with terrifying force.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his fingers about to break. He only held on for a moment before the whiskers slipped free.  A fierce glint flashed in his eyes.  A blood sword manifested in his right palm. He struck one of the whiskers with a powerful palm strike.</p><p>The whisker, though unbroken, was flung far away.</p><p>Ling Youwang couldn't ignore the force of this palm strike.  His fish body tilted involuntarily.  He didn't retaliate, however.  He swung his long tail and charged towards the star river.</p><p>At this moment, the Swallowing Sea Clam also materialized within the star river, transforming into a gigantic clam that swallowed the heavens. The water within its shell had vanished at some point.  Its shell opened wide, aimed at the Zīxiù constellation of the seven mansions.</p><p>The giant clam's shell obscured a large portion of the star river, capable of swallowing all the stars within the constellation in one gulp.</p><p>Just then, Zuo Zhenren passed through the celestial barrier, leisurely stepping into the jungle domain.  He gently pushed his palm downwards, and a wooden bead rolled down.</p><p>The wooden bead fell into the star river, effortlessly passing through the sword formation. In a flash, it appeared at the opening of the clam's shell.</p><p>The Swallowing Sea Clam's closing momentum abruptly halted, its suction disrupted. The wooden bead was firmly lodged between the shells, momentarily immovable.</p><p>With the Swallowing Sea Clam restrained, two long whiskers suddenly sprang up, lashing towards the star river.  But the Cloudroaming Sword was also a spiritual treasure. Even if the sword formation was inferior, it wouldn't crumble instantly.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang hadn't paused for a moment. He stomped his foot, his phoenix wings flapping rapidly, charging fiercely towards the Blackfish Dharma Idol.</p><p>Since the beginning of his fight with Ling Youwang, Qin Sang had rarely taken the initiative to attack.  His massive Wood Spirit body leaped high, spreading his arms, embracing the fish's tail in a bear hug.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>Ling Youwang roared in fury.</p><p>The fish tail struggled violently in his embrace.  Each twist felt like a whiplash to Qin Sang. His bones felt dislocated, pain radiating throughout his body. The protective light of the Mingshan Armor flickered, as if it couldn't bear the strain.</p><p>Ignoring his injuries, Qin Sang exerted all his strength, attempting to drag the Blackfish Dharma Idol towards the ground.</p><p>At this moment, the sword stars shifted.  The White Tiger's fierce煞 aura took form, diving downwards, its ferocious might awe-inspiring.</p><p>The White Tiger's fierce aura crashed into the two long whiskers, a thunderous roar echoing through the sky.</p><p>The whiskers swayed, and then a spiritual sword shot out from between the White Tiger's eyebrows, passing between the two whiskers. In an instant, the sword light blazed brilliantly.  Seven illusory shadows flashed and vanished, merging into the sword light, slashing towards the Blackfish Dharma Idol!</p><p>This sword strike had been changed to the Seven Souls Killing Formation, more adept at slaughter.</p><p>Even with his immense power, Ling Youwang didn't dare underestimate this sword strike.  Dingxiang Hou had nearly perished under this very sword!</p><p>Ling Youwang's rage was boundless, but he could only endure it. He hurriedly retracted his whiskers. The white light detached from them, transforming back into the white cord, its ends connecting to form a white ring.</p><p>The white ring, jade-like, hovered above Ling Youwang. Still uneasy, he spat out the scale-like treasure, shooting it towards the center of the white ring.</p><p>Glancing down at the tenacious Qin Sang, Ling Youwang's eyes burned with a fury that threatened to incinerate him.  With a roar, he twisted his upper body, lunging ferociously towards Qin Sang, his fangs rapidly enlarging in Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>The two colossal monsters crashed into the ground, entangled, tearing the earth apart, creating a network of fissures.</p><p>In midair, the sword light struck the white ring.  White light and sword light merged, exploding in a blinding flash.</p><p>The white ring trembled, its ends separating, writhing downwards like serpents.</p><p>The Cloudroaming Sword paused momentarily, then struck again!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang desperately entangled Ling Youwang, whistling sounds filled the jungle.</p><p>Golden light rained down from the sky, a magnificent spectacle, like falling meteors. The ground rumbled.</p><p>The golden light slammed into the earth, shaking the jungle violently.  Dozens of large craters appeared in the ground.</p><p>Golden light shimmered within the craters. Golden armored warriors leaped out, no longer bean-sized, their bodies now ten zhang tall, majestic and imposing.</p><p>The golden warriors landed precisely around the battlefield.</p><p>All the golden warriors wielded the same weapon: a golden iron chain.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren descended slowly, standing on a floating platform.  The Nine Heavens Soldier Talisman within the platform glowed brightly.</p><p>He formed hand seals, holding a yellow talisman between two fingers, channeling the power of the Nine Heavens Soldier Talisman.  He flicked it downwards, commanding, "Deploy the formation!"</p><p>"By your command!"</p><p>The golden warriors roared in unison.</p><p>Chains clattered as the golden warriors formed three concentric circles, creating a three-layered iron chain formation, completely surrounding the tree and the fish within the battlefield.</p><p>Because of Qin Sang, Ling Youwang couldn't escape the encirclement in time. He watched helplessly as the golden warriors formed their array.</p><p>The yellow talisman floated into the formation.</p><p>The golden warriors spun rapidly, their forms becoming a blur.  Three golden rings appeared on the ground.  As the golden light intensified, the rings connected.</p><p>In an instant, a golden Bagua formation disk took shape on the ground.</p><p>Within the formation, Qin Sang endured another blow from Ling Youwang, retreating a few steps, quickly absorbing Wood Spirit Qi to recover.</p><p>Now, the situation had reversed. Ling Youwang no longer had the leisure to manipulate the Wood Spirit Qi.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Ling Youwang glared at Zuo Zhenren in the sky, clearly recognizing him.</p><p>"Old demon, long time no see."</p><p>Zuo Zhenren smiled faintly. "It seems fate has brought us together again...  I was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances and missed a great opportunity.  Being able to eliminate you, old demon, makes this trip worthwhile."</p><p>"Old man, you dare to ignore the Divine Court's struggle?  Aren't you afraid of missing the Divine Court, the annihilation of your Dao Lineage, and the entire human race becoming food for my demon race!"</p><p>Ling Youwang's tone was chilling, but his mind was tense.</p><p>He hadn't expected another Grand True Person to remain here.  He had dared to disregard the Divine Court's struggle to search for treasures because of a hidden reason.</p><p>Logically, the Divine Court's struggle concerned the survival of the Daoist sects and the Ghostfang Kingdom.  Neither side had a way out, only a fight to the death!</p><p>His current situation was extremely precarious. Zuo Fengdao alone was enough to make him wary.  Coupled with Qin Sang, who was slightly weaker but held the advantage of terrain, Ling Youwang suddenly felt a wave of unease.</p><p>His words seemed to have struck a nerve with Zuo Zhenren.  Killing intent flashed in his eyes.  He said coldly, "I'll send you to the Yellow Springs first and let you see which Dao Lineage will be annihilated!"</p><p>Without finishing his words, Zuo Zhenren paced in a ritualistic gait, chanting a divine incantation.</p><p>"Great Emperor of the Northern Yin, decree from the Nine Netherworlds.</p><p>Summon the Warden swiftly, dispatch the infernal officers.</p><p>In accordance with the Emperor's decree, seize the wicked and examine the evil.</p><p>Thousands of blades and soldiers, dismember and transform.</p><p>Make haste!"</p><p>While chanting, he drew complex divine talismans in the void with his joined fingers, three in total, each completed in one fluid motion.</p><p>The three divine talismans radiated different lights: black, cyan, and gold.</p><p>The talisman light rained down upon the earth.</p><p>Empowered by the talismans, the golden warriors' auras surged, as if they had transformed into true divine generals, descending upon the mortal world to subdue evil.</p><p>Dozens of golden chains shot through the air, all aimed at Ling Youwang within the formation.  The chains resembled the soul-snatching chains wielded by infernal officers, not only incredibly strong but also imbued with a peculiar power to capture souls, suppress spirits, and subdue demonic entities.</p><p>Ling Youwang instantly felt an immense pressure descend upon him, as if several mountains were weighing down on his heart.</p><p>Free from restrictions, Qin Sang could finally unleash his full power, absorbing Wood Spirit Qi unrestrainedly. After a brief recovery, he charged towards Ling Youwang once more.</p><p>Each of Qin Sang's steps caused the earth to tremble, as if venting his frustration from being constantly on the defensive. His momentum built with each stride. Reaching Ling Youwang, his right hand transformed into a palm, radiating a dazzling Buddha's light.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Buddha's light condensed into a giant Buddha seal, imbued with astonishing life force.  Following Qin Sang's palm, it slammed down.</p><p>Above, the wooden bead continued its struggle against the Swallowing Sea Clam.</p><p>Ling Youwang tried several times but couldn't dislodge the bead.  He didn't have time to retract the Swallowing Sea Clam, and the attack had already arrived!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
