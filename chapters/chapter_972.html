<h1>Chapter 964: The Nine-Phoenix King</h1><p>Chapter 964: The Nine-Phoenix King</p><p>Two demons exchanged a glance, quickly manipulating their incantations, then  hurled the last of their spirit objects into the gray mist on the altar.</p><p>"Begin!"</p><p>Gu Heng gave the order, his voice strained.</p><p>The demons knew what to do.  They pressed their hands against the altar, pouring in their true energy. Qin Sang disguised his demonic energy, thankfully without being discovered.</p><p>Whether it was their actions or the effect of the last two spirit objects, the celestial beast patterns on the altar suddenly flickered with strange light, the white jade altar growing increasingly radiant.</p><p>The stone chamber was bathed in the altar's light, revealing every detail.</p><p>Simultaneously, the gray mist churned violently. The altar emitted a deafening hum, followed by a pillar of light that shot upwards, instantly striking the stone ceiling.</p><p>The demons were instantly swept away by the shockwave, groaning in unison as they scrambled to the entrance of the stone chamber, dodging the aftershocks with surprised expressions.</p><p>No wonder the Demon King had insisted they set up the array in this place.  The array's power was astonishing. Without the ancient restriction, the light pillar would have instantly pierced the clouds, making the entire Qisha Hall clearly visible and inevitably attracting cultivators.</p><p>The ancient restriction on the ceiling glowed, intercepting the light pillar.</p><p>Two powerful forces clashed. Fortunately, the ancient restriction was strong enough to hold the light pillar back, preventing it from breaking through.</p><p>The light pillar, instead of dissipating, intensified, becoming even more dazzling and powerful.</p><p>The entire cave was shaking.</p><p>Even now, they couldn't understand the array's purpose.</p><p>At that moment, the Rainbow-robed Lady seemed to sense something, letting out a soft gasp. Her beautiful eyes darted to the altar, a hint of doubt flashing across her face.</p><p>The next moment, the gray mist enshrouded by the light pillar suddenly parted to the sides, revealing a silver gleam in the middle, like a door opening, from which emerged a graceful figure, stepping out elegantly.</p><p>Seeing this, the demons were all shocked.</p><p>They never imagined that activating the array would bring someone out of the gray mist. This array didn't seem like a teleportation array at all?</p><p>A sudden change occurred. Qin Sang felt a sense of foreboding and his expression changed.</p><p>As the figure appeared, the altar stopped shaking, and the light pillar retracted.  They could finally see the figure's face clearly – a woman in courtly attire, exuding a noble aura.</p><p>"Ninth Aunt?"</p><p>The Rainbow-robed Lady gasped, her face a mixture of shock and disbelief, as she recognized the woman.</p><p>"Ninth Aunt... it's her, the Nine-Phoenix King?"</p><p>"Impossible! How could she be here?"</p><p>"Could it be...?"</p><p>The demons buzzed upon learning the woman's identity.</p><p>This woman was the Nine-Phoenix King, a transformed great demon from the Phoenix Clan of the Demon Sea.</p><p>No one expected the Nine-Phoenix King, who should have been in the Demon Sea, to suddenly appear in Qisha Hall.</p><p>Their ability to infiltrate the Canglang Sea was due to two factors.</p><p>Firstly, the *Burning Blood True Technique* allowed them to transform prematurely.</p><p>More importantly, their cultivation was low. Cultivators wouldn't expect a secret technique to allow Core Formation stage demons to transform ahead of schedule, so they weren't wary.</p><p>Transformed great demons were a different story.</p><p>Both races would be on high alert, and every Nascent Soul cultivator passing through a teleportation array would face the strictest scrutiny.  Even if a transformed great demon hid well, they couldn't possibly sneak into the Canglang Sea through a teleportation array.</p><p>Hearing the demons' discussion, Qin Sang inwardly groaned.  Dealing with a few pseudo-transformed demons was dangerous enough. He thought he could escape after completing the task, but a real transformed great demon had unexpectedly appeared.</p><p>He grumbled to himself, wondering what the human and witch clans, and the righteous and demonic paths' Nascent Soul cultivators were doing, allowing even a transformed great demon to infiltrate. The Canglang Sea was practically a sieve.</p><p>Inside the Corpse Puppet Pouch:</p><p>Bai was so angry he almost spat blood.</p><p>"A calamity unseen for a millennium!"</p><p>He wished he could go out and yell at Qin Sang, but he dared not move, feeling incredibly frustrated.</p><p>"Greetings, Nine-Phoenix King!"</p><p>The demons bowed. Qin Sang dared not lag behind, blending in with the crowd.</p><p>"Rise," the Nine-Phoenix King casually glanced at them, then turned to the slightly stunned Rainbow-robed Lady, her eyes softening with affection. She teased, "Caiyi, are you unhappy to see your Ninth Aunt?"</p><p>"Of course not!"</p><p>The Rainbow-robed Lady, transformed into a sweet and innocent girl, shook her head like a rattle.  "Caiyi just hasn't seen Ninth Aunt in a long time. I never expected to meet Ninth Aunt here! Is this array a teleportation array that brought Ninth Aunt here from another realm?"</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King sighed, "If there were such a teleportation array, things would be much easier. I was actually not far from Qisha Hall, waiting for you to act.  This array helps me activate the Celestial Phoenix Feather, breaking through space to teleport here."</p><p>Of course, without a cultivator first opening a passage in the outer magical array, even with the Sky Phoenix Feather, it wouldn't be possible to break through,"</p><p>"The Sky Phoenix Feather?  Ninth Aunt, you brought it with you?"</p><p>Caiyi exclaimed.</p><p>The other demons were secretly puzzled, unsure what the Sky Phoenix Feather was.</p><p>This object must be a priceless treasure of the Phoenix clan, causing Caiyi to react so dramatically. Could it truly be a feather from an ancient Sky Phoenix?</p><p>"Wait, Ninth Aunt, how are you outside the Seven Killing Hall? How did you get to the Canglang Sea? Have we found a teleportation array leading there?"</p><p>Realizing this, Caiyi's face lit up with joy.</p><p>Gu Heng remained silent, his gaze suddenly sharpening.  "Senior Nine Phoenix King, is Father also outside the Seven Killing Hall?"</p><p>The other demons also questioned her.</p><p>One demon, eager for trouble, excitedly said, "Senior, are you planning to wipe out all the cultivators entering the Seven Killing Hall? I'd be happy to help!"</p><p>"It's a long story.  I didn't come through a teleportation array, nor did I cross the storm belt. If there were a way to enter the Canglang Sea, we wouldn't have tolerated cultivators running rampant in the Demon Sea, slaughtering our kin, and us being helpless against them!"</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King said with hatred.</p><p>"I came alone.  The Jiao Kings paid a heavy price to get me into the Canglang Sea, and I was severely injured, almost dying. Fortunately, I had enough treasures with me and recuperated on a deserted island for decades…"</p><p>"That great battle was…"</p><p>The demons suddenly understood.</p><p>Qin Sang also suddenly understood.</p><p>Decades ago, the Demon Sea suddenly erupted in chaos. The demons fiercely attacked Tianwu Island. It's said that Tianwu Island was in grave danger, and the Wu clan nearly closed the teleportation array, abandoning the island.</p><p>Later, the demons besieged the human Great Desolate Island. The humans suffered heavy casualties before driving the demons back.</p><p>Could the real purpose of the demons launching that war have been simply to send the Nine Phoenix King into the Demon Sea? How did they manage that?</p><p>Qin Sang never expected to hear such a secret.</p><p>What does the Nine Phoenix King want in the Canglang Sea?</p><p>Entering is already so difficult; returning is practically impossible.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King, alone, at most with a few demon core-stage demons disguised through secret arts—however strong she is, she can't stir up much trouble.</p><p>What's the point?</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>The demons' elaborate plan—was their true target also the Seven Killing Hall?</p>
