<h1>Chapter 1059: The Poisonous Pool</h1><p>Chapter 1059: The Poisonous Pool</p><p>“Let me scout ahead. I have the Sky Phoenix Feather; even if I encounter danger, I can escape,”</p><p>said the Nine-Phoenix King.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King pondered for a moment, then warned, “Very well, but we’ll need the Sky Phoenix Feather to leave the inner chamber once we find the dragon corpse. Be careful not to exhaust its power.”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King nodded.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King channeled golden light, forming armor around her. The Nine-Phoenix King took out the Sky Phoenix Feather, holding it carefully as she cautiously entered.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as she entered the Zhenling Domain, something strange happened.</p><p>The unknown energy that permeated the void, previously calm, was disturbed by the Nine-Phoenix King’s entry, like dropping a pebble into a still lake.</p><p>In an instant, the void vibrated.</p><p>The unknown energy surged like a tidal wave.  Runes seemed to flash in the void, pressing down on the Nine-Phoenix King layer upon layer.</p><p>A flush rose on the Nine-Phoenix King’s face. She gritted her teeth, seemingly resisting immense pressure, though this pressure was intangible.</p><p>Her golden armor remained unchanged.</p><p>Her figure swayed slightly.  She felt her true energy stagnate and her spirit unstable.  She quickly retreated, preparing to try again.</p><p>At that moment, the armored strongman’s eyes flashed, and he called out to the Nine-Phoenix King, “Daoist Nine-Phoenix, there’s no need to try again. I have a pretty good idea what’s happening.”</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King frowned, dissatisfied. “I haven't even used the Sky Phoenix Feather…”</p><p>The armored strongman interrupted, saying gravely, “Your cultivation is insufficient.  You won't get far before you’re overwhelmed and forced back. The Sky Phoenix Feather might help you resist the ancient restrictions, but the entire Zhenling Domain is like this. How long can the feather’s power last? It would be wasted! We still need your help to escape, and I don’t want to be trapped in this cursed place.”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King was surprised. “Brother Hei seems quite knowledgeable about the Zhenling Domain?”</p><p>The armored strongman chuckled. “I’ve lived in the Canglang Sea for so many years; I’ve heard some rumors, though I wasn’t sure of their truth. Now I’ve seen it for myself.  It’s said there’s an ancient formation at the center of the Zhenling Domain. The entire domain exerts a strange suppression, making it impossible for low-level cultivators to move freely. Only powerful cultivators comparable to Daoist Nine-Phoenix, or at least at the peak of the Yuan Ying mid-stage, can withstand the formation’s suppression and move freely. Although Daoist Nine-Phoenix is about to break through to the mid-Transformation stage, it’s still not enough…”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King showed surprise, then stepped inside.</p><p>A similar scene unfolded, but the Jiao Dragon King fared much better than the Nine-Phoenix King; his true energy didn't show any significant stagnation.</p><p>“How strange this Zhenling Domain is!”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King retreated, frowning.</p><p>Then, to test the domain’s power, the armored strongman stepped inside.  Being at the peak of the mid-Transformation stage, he was close to breaking through to the late stage and could move freely.</p><p>The other demon kings were far behind.</p><p>One of them, a mid-Transformation stage Tiger King, prepared thoroughly and managed well initially, but after crossing two mountains, he felt increasingly strained and was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Humans suspect that the suppression here was once far more formidable, perhaps even impossible for Nascent Soul and Void Refinement masters to overcome. It may have been used to suppress something or for some other purpose. After countless millennia, the ancient formation’s power has weakened, and the suppression has lessened, allowing us to enter.”</p><p>The armored strongman glanced at the Tiger King. “A few hundred years from now, you might be able to enter. Not yet.”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King pondered, nodding.  “That’s a plausible theory… It seems we’ll have to go in and find the dragon corpse, while the rest of you wait outside.”</p><p>The armored strongman nodded. “It has to be done.  But I’m worried the dragon corpse might be somehow connected to the Zhenling Domain’s ancient formation. If we take the corpse and release something—perhaps an ancient demon from ages past—the Canglang Sea might be in trouble…”</p><p>“What would the dragon corpse have to do with a human formation?”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King shook his head, finding it absurd. “If the humans knew about the dragon corpse on Yitian Peak, they would surely take it without hesitation. Even if something happens, Brother Hei needn't worry. Once I get the dragon corpse, I'll break through to the Nascent Soul stage.  Taking the teleportation array will be a piece of cake. Then you can all return to the Demon Sea with me. The Canglang Sea is a human cultivator's domain; we just need to seal the teleportation array, wait and watch, and calmly clean up the mess…”</p><p>The armored strongman laughed. “If it’s one of our demon ancestors down there, even better! Our path to immortality might be secured.”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King chuckled, shaking his head repeatedly.  "Even if something truly *was* suppressed down there, the chances of it surviving to the present day are incredibly slim. The ancient array is worn down to this meager power; what level of being could resist the erosion of time and cling to life until now?"</p><p>He then addressed the other demon kings. "If it comes to it, my friends, you'll have to remain outside. Human cultivators frequently appear here; try to avoid conflict with them. Find a hidden place to conceal yourselves. If anything unexpected happens, we may need your assistance."</p><p>The demon kings exchanged glances and nodded in resignation.</p><p>The dragon corpse had been found by the Jiao Dragon King and the Armored Man; the best treasures were undoubtedly divided between them.  The others were left with mere scraps.</p><p>But their cultivation was insufficient to withstand the suppressing power.</p><p>"I can try," said Jiu Feng Wang, unwilling to give up.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King shook his head. "Hei Xiong is right. The Heavenly Phoenix True Feather is paramount. Even if we don't get the dragon corpse, we can't cut off our escape route. Jiu Feng, wait for me outside."</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang frowned, remaining silent.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King nodded to the Armored Man, about to enter, when Jiu Feng Wang suddenly stepped forward, offering him an object—a beautiful long feather.</p><p>"This Heavenly Phoenix feather, while less potent than the True Feather, can help you escape if you are trapped by a restriction. Take it, just in case. My clan has refined it into something akin to a magic artifact; it doesn't require Phoenix blood to activate. I'll transmit the method of controlling it..."</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang sent a voice transmission.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King expressed his gratitude, promising, "Rest assured, friend. As long as we find the True Dragon Scale, I will do my best for you..."</p><p>"I hope so," Jiu Feng Wang sighed almost imperceptibly.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King and the Armored Man walked side-by-side into the Spirit Suppressing Domain, gradually disappearing from sight.</p><p>The other demon kings didn’t wander, finding a hidden location nearby, setting up a barrier, and waiting for news from the Jiao Dragon King.</p><p>The two demons crossed the mountain range and entered the stone forest at the foot of Yi Tian Peak.</p><p>Using his secret technique again, he sensed, pointing to the left, exclaiming, "The dragon corpse isn't beneath Yi Tian Peak. It's in that direction!"</p><p>The two immediately set off, flying for a short time before a small lake appeared in the stone forest ahead.</p><p>Surprisingly, the lake water was clear and hadn't dried up.</p><p>"It's a poison pool!"</p><p>The Armored Man's expression changed slightly.</p>
