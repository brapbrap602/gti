<h1>Chapter 114: Failure</h1><p>Chapter 114: Failure</p><p>Mount Shaohua, Pure Moon Peak.</p><p>The cold moon shone, and a stream gurgled.</p><p>The flowing water converged into a crescent-shaped lake, splashing crystal clear droplets that resembled stardust under the night sky.  A beautiful octagonal pavilion floated on the lake, its gauzy curtains swaying gently in the breeze.</p><p>Inside the pavilion, a table was set with sandalwood tea. Two figures sat facing each other.</p><p>One was a middle-aged man in a brocade robe.  With a square face, sword-like eyebrows, and tiger-like eyes, he possessed an extraordinary appearance, radiating an aura of authority. He was Mount Shaohua's only Nascent Soul ancestor, Lord Dongyang.</p><p>Opposite him sat an elegant woman, like a celestial being descended from the heavens, untouched by the dust and grime of the world.  A veil covered her face.  With her head slightly bowed, her delicate hands prepared tea, her gaze fixed on the shimmering ripples in the teacup, exuding an air of ethereal solitude.</p><p>Lord Dongyang leaned forward, placing his hands on the table, his eyes fixed on the woman. His voice was low, "Lady Chenyan, after your last breakthrough failed, there's no turning back. Time is running out. You must make a decision."</p><p>Chenyan's hand trembled slightly, and a flicker of heartbreak flashed in her eyes.</p><p>Lord Dongyang, seemingly oblivious, pressed on, his tone and expression carrying a hint of coercion, though his words sounded like gentle persuasion, "This secret technique does indeed originate from the Demonic Sect, but techniques are neither righteous nor evil; it all depends on the user.  Moreover, this technique has been proven effective. If you're worried about your reputation, I assure you, I will personally handle everything afterward, ensuring absolute secrecy, so you won't be troubled in the slightest."</p><p>A long silence followed.</p><p>Chenyan closed her eyes slightly and softly said, "Alright."</p><p>…</p><p>Earth Sink Cave.</p><p>Agonized screams suddenly erupted from Qin Sang's cave, as if a ferocious beast were trapped within.  Unbeknownst to anyone, these cries came from Qin Sang himself.</p><p>Clutching his stomach, he had rolled off his meditation mat, his body curled into a fetal position. He writhed on the ground, his face contorted in unbearable pain, his complexion pale and bloodless. Sweat drenched his clothes and pooled on the floor around him.</p><p>The cause of his suffering was the Foundation Establishment Pill he had just consumed.</p><p>Exasperated by his snail-paced cultivation progress, Qin Sang had decided to take a chance with the pill. He had three, and if he were lucky enough to break through, he could save himself decades of cultivation.</p><p>Of course, he hadn't been reckless. He'd spent several days preparing, adjusting his physical and mental state to its peak. He'd placed healing elixirs and other necessities within reach, carefully recalling his master's instructions before cautiously swallowing the pill.</p><p>Master Wen had warned him that the pill's potency would cause some discomfort as it transformed his body, but Qin Sang had never imagined such agonizing pain.  It felt like a complete bodily reconstruction.</p><p>Initially, the effects were subtle.  But as the pill's power surged, his dantian felt like it was being squeezed, his energy sea threatening to shatter.  Simultaneously, his body was assaulted by a sensation of countless insects gnawing at his flesh.</p><p>Wave after wave of pain washed over him, making him feel disconnected from his own body.  After an unknown period, the agony finally subsided. Trembling, Qin Sang crawled to a corner of the cave, retrieved a jade bottle he had kicked away, and swallowed the healing elixir inside.  Only then did he find some relief.</p><p>Covered in a sticky, foul-smelling film, like a layer of mud, Qin Sang conjured a stream of water to cleanse himself before returning to his meditation mat.</p><p>His cultivation had advanced to the eleventh level of Qi Refining.  The transformation had also slightly improved his aptitude, and some residual medicinal power remained within his body, promising further progress.  But there was no joy.  This was expected. The Foundation Establishment Pill wouldn't live up to its name if it couldn't even achieve this much.</p><p>Qin Sang's worry was that despite consuming the pill, he hadn't even glimpsed the threshold of Foundation Establishment, let alone broken through.  It seemed that even if he took another pill, the result would be the same.</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>A mournful sigh echoed through the quiet cave.  Qin Sang tidied up, calmed his turbulent thoughts, and entered meditation, circulating his cultivation technique to absorb the remaining medicinal power, determined not to waste a single drop.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Lesser Hua Mountain and sought out Uncle Wen.</p><p>“You’ve taken a Foundation Establishment Pill?”</p><p>Uncle Wen noticed the change in Qin Sang's cultivation at a glance and frowned slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly and nodded, his face filled with shame.</p><p>“You're too impatient. Did you really think one spiritual fruit could drastically change your aptitude and protect you for life? I thought you'd be more composed than Zhuang Yan, but I didn't expect you to be so impulsive. What are your plans now?  Why not return from Earth Sink Cave? You can take over the miscellaneous tasks from Zhuang Yan and be my assistant.”</p><p>In Uncle Wen's eyes, after wasting his only Foundation Establishment Pill, Qin Sang had no chance of establishing his foundation. If he could settle down and work diligently in the sect, it would be a good outcome.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that the two spirit stones hadn't been wasted, but he hadn't given up on his cultivation path yet. He asked, "Uncle Wen, I've always had a question. Why are Foundation Establishment Pills so scarce? Even our eight righteous sects can't guarantee one pill per disciple. Are the ingredients so rare that the major sects can't cultivate them?"</p><p>Not only Foundation Establishment Pills, after leaving Lesser Hua Mountain last time, Qin Sang visited several nearby cultivation markets.  Previously, with his low cultivation and meager resources, he'd only ever glanced at the goods.</p><p>Now, after careful observation, he discovered that high-quality elixirs were rarely sold in the markets.</p><p>The best healing elixirs were only slightly better than the ones Sun De possessed.</p><p>Tonic pills effective for cultivators at the tenth level of Qi Refining and above were even rarer and incredibly expensive, usually only appearing at auctions.</p><p>It was said that the Great Elixir Sect’s alchemy skills surpassed all eight righteous sects.  However, very few of their pills ever made it to the market, and even if they did, they were priceless and beyond his reach.</p><p>This was one of the reasons why Qin Sang decided to gamble.</p><p>Uncle Wen saw through Qin Sang's intentions. “You want to refine your own Foundation Establishment Pills?  Let's not even talk about the difficulty of learning alchemy.  With your Qi Refining level, you wouldn't even be able to find the main ingredient.  It’s not just Foundation Establishment Pills. Pagoda Peak holds many ancient elixir recipes, all gathering dust because no one can refine them.  The reason is the lack of necessary spiritual herbs.  Even the most skilled chef can't cook without rice.”</p><p>Listening to Uncle Wen's explanation, Qin Sang finally understood the situation.</p>
