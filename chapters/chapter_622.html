<h1>Chapter 614: Doubts (Extra chapter for the alliance leader Ma Mangmeng!)</h1><p>Chapter 614: Doubts (Extra chapter for the alliance leader Ma Mangmeng!)</p><p>Strange, unfamiliar runes floated within his meridians and dantian.  Qin Sang had never seen anything like them before.</p><p>His spiritual energy was full, yet completely unusable, tightly bound.</p><p>The binding talisman left by Dongyang Bo was incredibly powerful. Qin Sang had tried countless times over the past few days, using every method he could think of, but couldn't affect it in the slightest.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially been skeptical of the *Stone Bridge Zen* that Dongyang Bo had offered.</p><p>This meditative practice clearly differed from Buddhist teachings; it felt more demonic than meditative. Buddhist cultivators pursue the path of detachment; it seemed completely incongruous. Qin Sang felt Dongyang Bo was likely deceiving Chenyan.</p><p>But after experiencing the effects of the talisman, Qin Sang changed his mind, filled with fear.</p><p>Breaking this talisman would require someone incredibly powerful. He even doubted whether a late Golden Core cultivator could manage it.</p><p>If the *Stone Bridge Zen* was a ruse, Dongyang Bo wouldn't have wasted such a precious talisman on him; a simple demonstration would have sufficed.  A mere False Core cultivator was hardly a threat he couldn't handle.</p><p>Perhaps Dongyang Bo was unwilling or unable to openly break with Chenyan, having considered a retreat. He was certain Chenyan would comply, so he used the talisman as a show of good faith.</p><p>The *Stone Bridge Zen*, the path of detachment, the murder-to-ascend—all seemed to be real.</p><p>If the jade Buddha hadn't protected his soul, shielding him from the talisman and giving him a fighting chance, he would have been utterly powerless, left to be slaughtered, facing certain death.</p><p>Qin Sang felt immense fear. The path of detachment was unlike dual cultivation; it made no sense.</p><p>"I would become a stone bridge, enduring five hundred years of wind, five hundred years of sun, five hundred years of rain, only so that she might walk across it!"</p><p>The path of detachment meant deeply loving someone, the deeper the better, until the seas run dry and the mountains crumble. The other person's feelings are irrelevant.</p><p>"Though mountains crumble and rivers run dry,</p><p>Though winter thunder roars and summer snows fly,</p><p>Though heaven and earth should meet,</p><p>I would never part from you!"</p><p>This is the ideal outcome!</p><p>When murdering one's spouse to achieve enlightenment, one experiences extreme grief, taking the life of the one they deeply love, undergoing the most agonizing heartbreak, and completely tearing apart their own heart.</p><p>Wenjun, newly widowed, achieved enlightenment through detachment!</p><p>However, this is also a weakness of the path of detachment.  Generally, it's difficult to achieve this extreme effect.  Insufficient cultivation might create flaws in the cultivator's Dao heart.</p><p>However, Qin Sang and Chenyan were bound by the *玄牝玉鼎真经* (Xuanpin Yudding Zhenjing), leaving an indelible mark on Chenyan's heart. If Chenyan opens her heart and allows the imprint to guide her, she might truly succeed.</p><p>In this case, the jade Buddha wouldn't save Qin Sang's life; instead, it would become a death warrant, making Chenyan love him even more deeply.</p><p>Once her cultivation is complete, Chenyan would behead Qin Sang; a hundred jade Buddhas wouldn't stop her.</p><p>With the talisman on him, he couldn't ask others for help. In this unfamiliar place, he couldn't find an expert to remove it quickly.  Furthermore, he'd have to lower all his defenses, opening his dantian and meridians to allow someone to intrude—essentially entrusting his life to another. Qin Sang would never do that.</p><p>The only solution Qin Sang could think of was to take advantage of the influx of spiritual energy during his Core Formation, using the opportunity to break the talisman.</p><p>However, during Core Formation, the convergence of Heaven and Earth’s energy, the most important effect was the infusion of spiritual energy and the unity of spirit and body; its inherent strength was actually limited.</p><p>Whether he could break the talisman, Qin Sang couldn't be certain.</p><p>Thinking about this, Qin Sang subconsciously touched his empty left shoulder.</p><p>He had severed this arm himself to use the *Lùshēn Fēnkūi Mìshù* (Body-Severing Puppet Secret Technique).</p><p>He'd obtained this technique after killing the Old Man Di Que in the ancient cultivator's tomb at Xuanlu Pass. It was a technique of self-mutilation, akin to a gecko's tail or a substitution.</p><p>The Old Man Di Que had plotted against Daoist Xuan Yu, using this method, severing his left arm. His previous leg injury was likely also due to this technique.</p><p>Since obtaining the *Body-Severing Puppet Secret Technique*, Qin Sang had never used it.</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, he didn't want to. After using the technique, even the Old Man Di Que couldn't regenerate the severed limb, leaving him crippled.</p><p>But at Ziwei Palace, facing Dongyang Bo, Qin Sang had prepared to sacrifice his arm to survive.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Yuan Ying masters had unpredictable abilities.  If Dongyang Bo attacked suddenly, he might have a counterattack. Qin Sang planned to use the puppet technique to escape.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Chenyan was decisive and successfully stopped Dongyang Bo, saving Qin Sang from losing his arm.</p><p>However, upon entering the teleportation array, Qin Sang's left arm was still lost.</p><p>His consciousness instantly dried up, his spiritual energy unusable.  Before losing consciousness, he felt an extremely terrifying power locking onto him, like a fatal blow.  </p><p>In his final moments, Qin Sang desperately tried a last resort, severing his own arm in a desperate attempt to escape the power, before falling unconscious.</p><p>The teleportation was instantaneous.</p><p>To this day, Qin Sang doesn't know if he was simply lucky enough to teleport before that power descended, or if the secret technique actually worked.  Because when he awoke, he wasn't at the other end of the teleportation array, nor had he been rescued, but was instead adrift in a river!</p><p>This baffled Qin Sang. He’d made countless guesses, none of which accounted for this situation.  Besides the self-inflicted arm wound, he only had bruises and scrapes from being in the river; no signs of being attacked by others.</p><p>Could the other side of the teleportation array have been a cliff, causing him to fall upon arrival?</p><p>Drifting in the river, Qin Sang was drained of consciousness, his spiritual energy suppressed, his body severely injured.  The corpse transformation within him raged unchecked, his body emanating a corpse aura, making him indistinguishable from a dead body.</p><p>His most dangerous moment came when he encountered the man with the animal skin.  Fortunately, this man's cultivation was low.  Seeing the strong corpse aura emanating from Qin Sang, he let his guard down, carelessly opening his spirit beast pouch, and was devoured by the Blood-Winged Devil Bees.</p><p>Actually, whether the man opened his puppet pouch or his spirit beast pouch, he would have died.  The Flying Night Rakshasa had completed its transformation. Had the man opened the puppet pouch, Qin Sang would have had the Rakshasa’s protection and wouldn't be in such a dire state.</p><p>Though he hadn't managed to fully subdue the Blood-Winged Devil Bees, he'd kept them for a long time and there was a certain bond. The bees, familiar with Qin Sang's scent, initially refrained from attacking him.  However, once they'd devoured all the living creatures around, that might change.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not stay. Using every ounce of strength, he flipped himself over, using the current and a broken piece of wood to drift away, until he was rescued by the mute woman.</p><p>After days of recuperation, he’d finally regained some energy.  Once his consciousness recovered a little, he could access his storage ring and retrieve healing medicines, speeding his recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the mute woman and softly said, “The old woman was right. You're too trusting. You can’t believe people so easily in the future.”</p><p>(I didn’t rest at noon, so I rushed this chapter out.  Normal schedule tonight.</p><p>I’m curious, the last chapter only mentioned his spiritual energy being suppressed. When did it say he needed to start cultivating again?</p><p>Why are you all so sure, and so angry about it?  -_-||</p><p>Do you really think my plot is that easy to figure out?)</p>
