<h1>Chapter 1909: A Visit</h1><p>Qin Sang and Xiao Wu entered the restaurant. Zhuque landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, following them inside.</p><p>The waiter hesitated upon seeing Zhuque, but didn't stop them. He discreetly signaled a waitress to keep a close watch.</p><p>Zhuque wasn't as conspicuous as a spirit horse; as long as it didn't disturb other guests, it was acceptable.</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiao Wu settled at a table by the window.</p><p>"Our Snow Jade Liquid is the restaurant's signature drink, meticulously brewed from Nine-Colored Lotus grown in the Cold Fire Pool.  It's famous throughout Sihuo Town. The Cold Fire Pool is a rare cold pool in the Fire Domain, perpetually covered in ice and snow despite being surrounded by a sea of lava. This unique landscape, a juxtaposition of extreme cold and heat, nurtures unique creatures and creates a distinctive flavor. You absolutely must try it..."</p><p>"This Fish Dragon Spitting Pearls dish uses silver dragon fish raised in the Cold Fire Pool, and the pearls are carved from the rare Yooli bird's head crest..."</p><p>The waitress described each dish in detail.</p><p>Qin Sang listened with great interest, while Zhuque was already smacking its lips.</p><p>Xiao Wu also perked up his ears, looking serious, though he didn't quite understand everything.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the waitress for more details.</p><p>Only after the waitress was completely out of breath did Qin Sang wave her off.</p><p>"Forget the three-hundred-year-old silver dragon fish; those are too expensive.  You're a truly gifted storyteller. Even the less expensive dishes sound like rare delicacies, making my mouth water. Let's have one of each. And three pots of Snow Jade Liquid."</p><p>"Right away, sir."</p><p>The waitress, still smiling, bowed and left. Shortly after, a waiter brought the Snow Jade Liquid, followed by the dishes.</p><p>The clear jade pot held a light-green liquid, as pure as the sky.</p><p>Even through the jade, the abundant spiritual energy was palpable, confirming the waitress's words.</p><p>Qin Sang poured a cup.</p><p>The Snow Jade Liquid was sweet and smooth, followed by a cool sensation that went down to the stomach, then exploded like a gentle fire, a warmth that even Qi Refining cultivators could easily handle and find nourishing.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in approval, pouring a small cup for Xiao Wu. "Xiao Wu, try some."</p><p>As for Zhuque, it didn't need any help; it pulled out the jade pot's stopper and drank a whole pot in one go.</p><p>Xiao Wu sipped the Snow Jade Liquid slowly, his expression unchanged, as if it were just ordinary water.</p><p>Qin Sang selected several dishes for Xiao Wu, each with a different flavor.</p><p>"There are five tastes: spicy, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. Life is the same. Experiencing life's joys and sorrows might be difficult now, but you can start by savoring these flavors..."</p><p>Xiao Wu picked up his chopsticks, imitating Qin Sang, and took a bite of a snow-white petal.  He frowned slightly.</p><p>It was a Moon-Shine flower, bitter but medicinal, and uniquely delicious in this dish.</p><p>After the Snow Jade Liquid, the Moon-Shine flower was quite a contrast for Xiao Wu.</p><p>Zhuque chuckled from Qin Sang's shoulder, shaking with laughter.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed too.</p><p>Xiao Wu sampled each dish, his expression gradually becoming more animated, though subtly.</p><p>"Which did you like best?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Xiao Wu thought for a moment and pointed at the Snow Jade Liquid and two plates of pastries.</p><p>"All sweets, a child's nature indeed," Qin Sang shook his head with a smile, encouraging Xiao Wu to eat heartily.</p><p>If they waited any longer, Zhuque would have eaten everything.</p><p>Third Floor Private Room:</p><p>All the dancers had been dismissed.</p><p>On one side, there was boisterous drinking and merrymaking.</p><p>On the other, a shrewd man and a burly man called "Second Brother" silently sipped tea.</p><p>Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and a man slipped in, whispering to the two before sneering, "Checked it out.  They couldn't even afford the silver dragon fish.  Not big shots."</p><p>"They can afford two spirit beasts; they must have some money," the shrewd man mused.</p><p>"That blue horse is really nice," the man chuckled.</p><p>"Let's do it!"</p><p>Second Brother slammed his fist on the table. "Old Seven, this is an important mission. We'll do it outside the city. I'll give you five men. Be quick and clean, don't cause any trouble, or it'll make things difficult for Boss Yin."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>...</p><p>After the meal and some shopping, completing their charade, Qin Sang bought supplies for the Fire Domain from various shops, and strolled towards the north gate on horseback.</p><p>Outside the city, Qin Sang summoned a gust of spiritual wind, lifting himself and his horse into the air.</p><p>The scenery grew desolate, a red glow appearing on the northern horizon.</p><p>While flying over a deserted hill, Qin Sang felt a sudden premonition and landed.  Luo Hou, the horse, stamped its hooves restlessly. Zhuque, the fire crow, couldn't contain its excitement, thankfully unnoticed.</p><p>Suddenly, "Bang! Bang! Bang!"  Six figures in black robes and masks surrounded them.</p><p>"Wow, this Daoist's spiritual sense is incredibly sharp," one of them exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the speaker—the shrewd man from the third floor of the Juxian Building.</p><p>"I've just arrived, heading to the Fire Region to gather herbs. I haven't wronged anyone.  Why are you blocking my path? If I've trespassed, I apologize and will leave," Qin Sang said, bowing.</p><p>The men erupted in laughter.  They had already set up a formation, feeling confident.</p><p>"Daoist, you're a seasoned traveler. Don't play dumb! Hand over your pouch. We only want your valuables, not your life," the shrewd man said with a chuckle.</p><p>Qin Sang's calm demeanor made the shrewd man uneasy.  Qin Sang calmly replied, "Only valuables, not life?  If you can truly adhere to that principle, we can talk."</p><p>"Seventh Brother,"  one of the men who had been watching Xiao Wu spoke, "Remember Red Granny's request for infants?  Many were sent by the leader, but few were deemed suitable. We still need two. This little girl looks exceptionally vibrant, even if she's blind. Red Granny might like her."</p><p>He chuckled, "Daoist, if your daughter pleases Red Granny, you'll be rich! Don't forget us brothers!"</p><p>"Who is Red Granny? What's the purpose of the infants?" Qin Sang turned, feigning interest, a glimmer in his eyes.</p><p>"You haven't heard of Red Granny?  She's a Yuan Ying master, an elder of the Shangxue Palace, who cultivates the infamous Seven Blood Infant Transformation Technique…"</p><p>The man excitedly revealed everything about Shangxue Palace and Red Granny.</p><p>"Tenth!" the shrewd man yelled, trying to stop him.</p><p>Ignoring him, the man continued his rambling.</p><p>*Slap!* A whip cracked, hitting the man hard. His robe tore, and he was sent flying, still babbling on the ground.</p><p>"If your daughter becomes Red Granny's infant, she'll be her most intimate companion. Even if Red Granny later gives her to another powerful cultivator, you'll at least become a father-in-law, heh heh…"  The man continued his crazed monologue.</p><p>The familiar laughter of his companions now sounded like death knells to the shrewd man and his group; a bone-chilling fear gripped them.  They finally realized something was wrong.</p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"  The men retreated. The shrewd man bowed, saying, "We were blind and disrespectful. Let's consider this a misunderstanding…"</p><p>Ignoring him, Qin Sang silently noted Shangxue Palace and Red Granny, muttering, "Seven Blood Infant Transformation Technique… sounds like a method for creating furnaces and servants… not a righteous path…"  He glanced at Xiao Wu, whose expression remained unchanged.</p><p>Xiao Wu didn't understand the implications of being taken as an infant.</p><p>"Apparently, I'm still too 'high' up.  I need to continue south…"  Qin Sang considered sending Xiao Wu to a mortal school, to live a mortal life. First, he would settle this matter.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's confidence, the men's unease grew.</p><p>Another man shouted, "Daoist, release Tenth Brother immediately!  Dare to hurt us? You won't leave Sihuozhen alive! No matter how strong you are, you can't fight everyone, and you'll injure your daughter!"</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang looked at him, "You have backers in Sihuozhen?"</p><p>"The Yin and Gou families of Sihuozhen are close to our leader.  They have many experts and can easily mobilize half of Sihuozhen's forces to kill you…"  The same scene played out before the shrewd man.  His men, like before, were acting strangely.</p><p>He hadn't detected Qin Sang making any move, and couldn't fathom how she'd done it.  Unease turned to terror.</p><p>The shrewd man secretly quickened his pace, about to flee, when he met Qin Sang's gaze and heard a question:  “Who are you? Where are your accomplices?”</p><p>He froze, all thoughts vanishing, replaced by an irresistible urge to answer.</p><p>“We’re the Thirteen Eagles of the Northern Desert. We took on two jobs, passing through Sihuo Town.  My elder brother is leading men west, to kill the old man Hong Xi on Chi Lang Mountain. My second brother is taking men east, delivering some boxes to the Zou family in Chao City. They’re sealed with yellow talismans; my brother forbids anyone from opening them, and we don't know what's inside…”</p><p>“The famed Thirteen Eagles of the Northern Desert. It's an honor.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Times were turbulent, with rampant banditry. The Thirteen Eagles were among the most notorious, taking on jobs while still pursuing their old ways.</p><p>“Keep an eye on them. I'll go get the others,” Qin Sang told Xiao Wu and Luo Hou.</p><p>Zhu Que, perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, finding the rules too strict, slipped onto Luo Hou.</p><p>Qin Sang moved, and a bang echoed behind her. Turning, she saw several bandits vanish into thin air.  A flash of five-colored light briefly appeared in the void, originating from Xiao Wu's delicate fingers.</p><p>Zhu Que zipped behind Qin Sang, utterly terrified.</p><p>“I’m scared! I’m scared!”</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>Luo Hou hesitated, trembling, his legs shaking, his eyes pleading with Qin Sang for help.</p><p>Xiao Wu, who had just casually killed several people, had her eyes closed, her expression serene and innocent.</p><p>“Why did you kill them?” Qin Sang asked softly.</p><p>Xiao Wu replied seriously, “They were going to run.”</p><p>Qin Sang had told her to watch the bandits; they tried to escape, so she killed them.</p><p>Zhu Que shivered.  It dared to act up around Qin Sang because it knew Qin Sang wouldn't hurt it, but if Xiao Wu ever misunderstood…</p><p>The consequences were unthinkable!</p><p>Qin Sang ruffled Xiao Wu's hair. “From now on, unless I tell you to, you may only use the five elemental divine light, okay?”</p><p>“Mm!”</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded obediently.</p><p>“A long and arduous task lies ahead!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, then considered another problem. “If you claim to be righteous, you can't act so arbitrarily. If Xiao Wu kills someone who doesn't deserve death, should I seek justice for them? There's no absolute justice in the world. Different perspectives make good and evil flip. Even the Purple Star Emperor can't discern absolute good and evil. Besides, with the world so chaotic, can we really kill everyone who deserves it? There are certainly things I haven't grasped yet…”</p><p>East of Sihuo Town.</p><p>A group of men were flying on grey-winged giant eagles when a sudden gust of wind shattered the protective demonic energy of the eagles.  Despite their efforts, they were thrown to the ground, disoriented, finding the men taken away by their leader beside them.</p><p>“I harbored a grudge against someone and slaughtered their entire clan, hundreds of innocent people…”</p><p>“I can’t remember how many people I’ve robbed and killed. Men were beheaded, women… their vital essence drained…”</p><p>“I don’t drain their vital essence. I keep them for my pleasure. When I'm tired of one, I switch to another, hehehe…”</p><p>In the wind and sand, the bandits recounted their bloody deeds.  As they spoke, their heads were severed, staining the sand crimson.</p><p>In the end, two were found not to deserve death, which surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>Inside the city.</p><p>The Yin Family.</p><p>The meeting hall was brightly lit. An elderly man with white hair sat in the main seat, beside a plump man holding a folding fan, appearing gentle. They were in discussion.</p><p>Suddenly, the door was pushed open, revealing a tall and a short figure.</p><p>The elderly man's expression changed, his eyes becoming as sharp as a hawk's. “Who dares to be so presumptuous! Guards, seize them!”</p><p>He thought it was some unruly family member, but upon closer inspection, he saw strangers.</p><p>The doorway remained silent.</p><p>The elder realized he'd used a formation to seal the hall for his discussion with the Gu family head, and it had been silently broken.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>A chill ran down his spine. He was about to stand when a terrifying force held him down.</p><p>“You're the head of the Yin family… and you are?”</p><p>Qin Sang walked into the hall with Xiao Wu.</p><p>The plump man tightened his grip on his fan, feigning composure. “I am the Gu family head. May I ask your identity?”</p><p>“The Gu family, the nominal rulers of Sihuo Town,” Qin Sang said knowingly. “Does the Gu family also have ties with the bandits?”</p><p>The elder regained his composure and said calmly, “As they say, grievances are easily resolved, but grudges are not easily forgotten. I wonder where the Yin family has offended you; I am willing to apologize. My master is Elder Yu Daozi of Tian Liang Mountain; perhaps you have some connection with him?”</p>
