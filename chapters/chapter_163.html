Fire Raven Formation

Wu Yuesheng's face was so pale that it was almost bloodless. Evidently, his essence soul had suffered significant injuries. He cupped his fists in salute to everyone, but before he could utter another word, he sat on the ground and entered meditation to recover.

On the contrary, the Liu brothers were slightly better, but they also needed to adjust their breaths.

Once the three of them had recovered, everyone gathered around the pool.

"The water in the pool is the embodiment of the formation's restriction. Layer by layer, the restrictions are stacked to form a formidable grand formation. Earlier, my Junior-Apprentice Brother Yu and I attempted to use all means and join hands to break the restriction on the upper level, but we were unsuccessful. Fortunately, I have some experience in the way of formations, and I inferred the rules of the core restrictions of the formation, which allowed me to think of using the fire raven token to break the formation. After we stopped, the pool quickly returned to its original state. Therefore, we must break the restriction in one go, or else everything will be in vain. Moreover, we only have one chance. If the fire raven essence soul in the fire raven token is depleted without breaking the formation, we will have to go back to replenish the fire essence in the fire raven token, which will waste a few years."

Qing Ting reminded them with a solemn tone.

Everyone knew that the restrictions were troublesome and did not dare to take them lightly. They followed Qing Ting's instructions, each of them selecting a position and taking out their own handy magic artifacts.

Shao Hua Mountain had the most swordsmanship formulas, and there were many exquisite ones among them. Therefore, most of the disciples in the sect were sword cultivators. Apart from Qing Ting, the other four people all used swords.

Bai Yunshan did not take out the cloth bag, but instead took out a wooden staff. With a gentle tap, the scene of a dense forest appeared and disappeared in front of the staff, which was very strange.

The Liu brothers joined forces and controlled a lotus flower. The petals of this flower were made of refined iron, and the edges gleamed with a cold light. They were extremely sharp and did not have the slightest bit of charm. At a glance, it was obvious that it was a killing weapon.

When she saw Qin Sang take out his Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword, Qing Ting immediately decided to have Qin Sang lead the breaking of the formation. It was a time when everyone needed to work together. Qin Sang naturally had no objections and flew to the top of the restriction, standing in the middle.

"Everyone, pay attention to my fingers. I will point to a certain spot. Immediately use your magic artifacts to attack that spot. When the waves in the pool become violent, Junior-Apprentice Brother Qin will use the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword to defeat the restriction in one fell swoop."

Qing Ting looked at everyone's faces one by one. After confirming that there were no problems, she nodded slightly and looked down at the pool. At the same time, she waved her hand and hit the pool water with several spiritual energies, causing ripples to appear.

Qin Sang also looked back and forth with curiosity. Unfortunately, his understanding of formations was really not up to par. He could not discover the weaknesses of the restrictions as quickly as Qing Ting.

"There!"

Qing Ting suddenly pointed her finger.

With one command, everyone moved. Several magic artifacts emitted a brilliant light. Everyone was experienced. The scene seemed chaotic, but it was actually orderly. One attack after another followed, hitting the spot pointed out by Qing Ting.

'Splash...'

The pool suddenly churned with waves, and the waves hit the shore.

Qin Sang took a deep breath, secretly urged the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword, attracted the Five Elements spiritual energy around him, and the spirit sword transformed into five azure dragons. When he heard Qing Ting shout, 'Junior-Apprentice Brother Qin,' he did not hesitate to order the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword to dash away.

'Boom!'

After the loud sound, water splashed everywhere, but it disappeared as soon as it flew out of the pool. Then, they looked at the pool, and it was one layer less than before.

"Good!"

Yu Daiyue's face was filled with joy. "Everyone, let's keep doing this. We will definitely break the formation this time."

The eight people joined hands and broke the seal much faster and more easily than the two of them, Qing Ting and Yu Daiyue.

Later, everyone became familiar with the process and worked together very well. Without Qing Ting reminding them, Qin Sang was able to accurately grasp the时机 of breaking the restriction.

One layer after another of the restrictions was broken, and the water in the pool slowly decreased.

However, at this time, the pressure on them also became greater. Before the formation could be completely broken, the restriction in the pool could actually recover automatically. Not only did they have to break the formation as quickly as possible, but they also had to focus on suppressing the restriction.

After a few hours, everyone had barely stopped. The water in the pool finally became a thin layer, and everyone suddenly became excited, sweeping away their fatigue.

"There are only two more layers, and it will be the core restriction of the formation!"

Qing Ting's voice could not hide her excitement, but she was still able to make calm decisions. "Everyone, stop breaking the formation for now and don't let the pool recover. Make the most of this time to adjust your breathing. We will break the restriction with the Fire Raven Formation later!"

After some adjustment, everyone changed their positions under Qing Ting's guidance.

Qing Ting, Yu Daiyue, and Bai Yunshan, the three most powerful people, were in the center of the three talents. Qin Sang and the other five were in the outer circle, occupying the four corners. The Liu brothers were close to each other.

All eight men took up their positions around the pool, each man occupying one of seven directions. They all put away their magic weapons and took out their Fire Raven tokens.
Qin Sang looked down at the pool. He could clearly see the bottom, and yet it still seemed unfathomably deep. He could see nothing inside the pool, and the stones around the edge were as black as ink, just like the stones outside the cave, exuding a sinister coldness.
He did not know what was down there. He was far better off on the outside, just in case there was some evil thing sealed in there. That way, at least he would have a little time to react.
Unhurriedly, Qin Sang looked around him, deciding which way he would escape should the need arise. He then discreetly readied his Nether Yin Lightning in preparation for any eventuality.
“Begin!”
Qing Ting roared.
Qin Sang quickly focused his thoughts and concentrated his mind on the Fire Raven token. Immediately, he heard a series of sharp “caws” beside his ears. The Raven Essence was still trying to break free of the token’s constraints.
However, after ten long days of sacrificing and refining, Qin Sang had long since brought the Raven Essence under his control. As soon as he activated the Fire Raven token, the Raven Essence instantly became obedient.
The Fire Raven token spun rapidly and flew from Qin Sang’s palm to hover above the pool. At the same time, the other six Fire Raven tokens also flew up.
The seven Fire Raven tokens spun in a circle around the pool. Just then, roaring flames erupted from the Fire Raven tokens.
The colors of the flames varied from dark green to crimson to pink to black. Each flame was hotter than the last, completely driving away the lingering cold in the air.
“Caw! Caw!”
The ravens’ cries grew louder and more annoying. After emerging from the Fire Raven tokens, the flames transformed into fist-sized fire ravens. In an instant, the air above the pool was filled with a thick cloud of fire ravens.
Now, all Qin Sang and the others needed to do was focus on controlling the Fire Raven tokens. Qing Ting and two others would take care of manipulating the Fire Raven Formation.
Flocks of fire ravens collided with each other above the pool, some devouring others, some dancing around. The already spacious cavern now seemed cramped.
It was complete chaos, but slowly and surely, a giant Fire Raven Formation emerged. The formation was filled with flames, its wild intensity a sharp contrast to the restraint of the pool’s barriers.
“Break!”
Qing Ting shouted softly.
A deafening cry rang out from the Fire Raven Formation, and the fire ravens on the east side of the pool swooped down in one go. They packed together in midair to form a fiery arrow, which forcefully pierced its way into the pool!
