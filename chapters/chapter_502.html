<h1>Chapter 495: The Iron Thumb Ring</h1><p>Qin Sang carefully placed Dove Robe Daoist's golden core into a jade box and sealed it. A look of joy crossed his face as he let out a long sigh of relief.  Despite the many twists and turns of this journey, his most important goal had been achieved.</p><p>After putting away the golden core, Qin Sang picked up the iron thumb ring. He was surprised by its unexpected weight; it was clearly no ordinary object.  Turning it over in his hands, he examined it closely. The ring was devoid of markings both inside and out, and almost all the rust was concentrated on the inner surface, forming a solid patch.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure out how this rust had formed.  He tried several times to remove it, even shaping his spiritual power into a blade, but to no avail. He then used his divine sense, which easily swept through the ring without encountering any resistance. It appeared to be just a regular thumb ring made of black iron.</p><p>Could he have been wrong?  Did the ring hold some other special meaning for Dove Robe Daoist?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  He still couldn't believe that Dove Robe Daoist would risk his life while carrying around an ordinary thumb ring.</p><p>Suddenly, an idea struck him.  He turned the ring over again and stared at the rust on the inside. Extending his divine sense, he carefully probed the rusty area, meticulously examining every nook and cranny.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang's expression shifted.  His divine sense seemed to have touched a certain point, and with a 'boom,' he was pulled into a chaotic space.  Before he could even perceive his surroundings, a blinding divine light erupted within the space. The source of the light was a blade, hurtling towards his divine sense at an alarming speed.</p><p>In an instant, the blade's edge was upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, retracting his divine sense. However, the blade's edge shot out of the iron thumb ring, following the path of his retreating divine sense and slashing towards him!</p><p>Though slender, the blade's edge possessed extreme sharpness, nearly causing Qin Sang to break out in a cold sweat.  A thunderous clap rang out.</p><p>Instinctively, Qin Sang threw the ring away and transformed into a streak of sword light. Employing the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique, he instantly moved several meters away, narrowly escaping the blade's edge.</p><p>He stared at the iron thumb ring with a complex expression.</p><p>The aura of the blade clearly belonged to Dove Robe Daoist.  It was a divine sense restriction left within the ring.  Though Dove Robe Daoist was dead, the restriction remained active. Anyone other than Dove Robe Daoist who triggered it would be immediately attacked by the blade.</p><p>Picking up the ring again, Qin Sang was now prepared. He experimented a few times and discovered that the power of the restriction wasn't insurmountable. It was, after all, an ownerless object.  Dove Robe Daoist was dead, and one didn't need to surpass him in power to break the restriction.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was currently unable to do so.</p><p>Unable to unlock the restriction, Qin Sang couldn't determine the ring's function.  But the chaotic space felt very familiar, somewhat similar to a storage pouch.</p><p>Could the iron thumb ring also store items?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  If the ring was a powerful magical treasure, Dove Robe Daoist would have used it against him. This seemed highly likely.</p><p>So... Dove Robe Daoist's possessions were all inside the ring!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. Ji Wu's storage pouch had been destroyed in the final explosion, and he had assumed Dove Robe Daoist's pouch had met the same fate.  He hadn't expected this unexpected gain.</p><p>Aside from the treasures within, the ring itself was far more discreet than a storage pouch.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't open it!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of regret.  Based on the strength of the restriction, he estimated he would need to reach the Golden Core stage before he could unlock it.  He couldn't ask anyone for help with this.</p><p>However, Qin Sang doubted Dove Robe Daoist had much left of value.</p><p>He had been a fugitive, relentlessly pursued by the Yuanzhao Sect for years. He had only managed to survive for a few years after the Yuanzhao Sect relaxed their pursuit.</p><p>Moreover, Dove Robe Daoist hadn't dared to show himself, relying on his subordinates to act on his behalf.  Of his four Flame Envoys, only Ji Wu had remained truly loyal after Qin Sang had eliminated Silver Flame.</p><p>During this time, Dove Robe Daoist had been hiding, not only healing his injuries but also repairing the Ten Yama Pennant.  Even vast wealth wouldn't last forever under such circumstances.</p><p>Dove Robe Daoist's performance in this battle had also demonstrated this.  He had only used one Ten Yama Pennant throughout the entire fight.</p><p>Remembering the pennant, Qin Sang put away the thumb ring, stood up, and scanned his surroundings.  He found Dove Robe Daoist's Ten Yama Pennant in the dirt.</p><p>Now, three of the five Ten Yama Pennants passed down by Grand Patriarch Kui Yin were in Qin Sang's possession.</p><p>With the three Golden Core cultivators of the Kui Yin Sect dead, and the surviving Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivators also killed by Qin Sang, the legacy of Grand Patriarch Kui Yin, the once-great demonic lord, had been completely severed!</p><p>The pennant's fabric had been torn by the Flying Celestial Yaksha, but the damage wasn't critical and could be repaired.  However, like Yu Hua's pennant, it would have to wait until Qin Sang reached the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Finally, dragging his weary body, Qin Sang went to the cliff face and retrieved the Flying Celestial Yaksha.</p><p>Its limbs were twisted, its body covered in wounds, and pale bone fragments were visible everywhere. The most severe injury was to its dantian area.  Its energy sea was nearly destroyed, and its corpse core was covered in cracks. Fortunately, the core hadn't completely shattered and could still be salvaged.</p><p>Witnessing the Flying Celestial Yaksha's惨状, Qin Sang sighed softly, then felt a sense of relief. This was the best possible outcome.</p><p>Refining a Flying Celestial Yaksha was incredibly difficult, and even Qin Sang wasn't confident he could do it again.</p><p>The Yaksha could be restored, but it would take time.  The damaged corpse core was beyond Qin Sang's ability to heal.  The Yaksha would have to nurture it on its own. If left in the Corpse Puppet Pouch, this process could take an extremely long time.</p><p>He would probably have to place it in the depths of the Earth Sinkhole, where it could constantly absorb earthsha energy, to accelerate its recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the Yaksha, treated its flesh wounds, and put it into the Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>The pouch was now almost empty, containing only two Foundation Establishment mid-stage corpse puppets.</p><p>This battle had nearly depleted all of Qin Sang's resources.</p><p>...</p><p>The moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>Cold Mountain City.</p><p>The doors of the Ji family ancestral hall were tightly shut.  Only Ji Sheng, the family patriarch, remained inside.</p><p>The restricted area had become quiet, but no one felt at ease.  No one dared to inspect the area.  Fear gripped everyone.  Ji Sheng had ordered them back to their rooms to cultivate in quietude while he stayed alone in the ancestral hall.</p><p>The hall was silent, lit by flickering candles. Ji Sheng sat motionless, his cloudy eyes fixed on the ancestral tablets, lost in thought.</p><p>Suddenly, a gust of wind stirred.</p><p>The candle flames danced, casting flickering shadows.</p><p>Ji Sheng abruptly turned his head.  To his astonishment, a corpse puppet now stood behind him.  Floating beside the puppet, written in spiritual energy, were these words:</p><p>"I am a friend of Ji Wu. He once helped me. This puppet has Foundation Establishment strength. I leave it to the Ji family, to ensure its safety for generations."</p><p>As Ji Sheng finished reading, the characters distorted and vanished into thin air.</p><p>Ji Sheng's eyes widened. He leapt to his feet and rushed out of the ancestral hall.</p><p>Outside, the moon bathed the courtyard in its light.</p><p>The sky was filled with stars.</p><p>Not a soul was in sight.</p><p>"My son..."</p><p>Ji Sheng looked towards the restricted area, then 'thump,' he collapsed to his knees, a single tear rolling down his cheek and landing on the stone steps.</p>
