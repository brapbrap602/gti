<h1>Chapter 1326: Public Lecture</h1><p>Chapter 1326: Public Lecture</p><p>"Let's see how this formation works."</p><p>Qing Jun took out the Demon Binding Rope and a new formation diagram.</p><p>Qin Sang then realized that Qing Jun had been studying the Demon Binding Rope all these years.</p><p>Last time, Qing Jun had recreated a formation diagram based on the one Qin Sang had copied, allowing her to use the Demon Binding Rope, but it only unleashed a fraction of its power and had significant limitations.</p><p>Later, Qing Jun and Bai exchanged ideas and made new discoveries, but it wasn't until after the great battle that she had time for seclusion.</p><p>Judging by Qing Jun's confident expression, she must be very pleased with this new formation.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Fire Lotus Seed, summoning the demonic fire.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>As soon as the demonic fire appeared,</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and dozens of serpentine images of the Demon Binding Rope shot out from Qing Jun's hand.</p><p>In an instant, the demonic fire was surrounded by the images, shrinking into a fireball, trapped within a cage formed by the Demon Binding Ropes.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled; he hadn't even noticed when Qing Jun had set up the formation.</p><p>He recalled that last time, Qing Jun had needed time to prepare beforehand, making it impractical on the battlefield.  This time, it was incredibly fast!</p><p>He looked at Qing Jun and saw the formation diagram hovering above her head.</p><p>The formation diagram and the Demon Binding Rope she held were closely linked, appearing as one.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's surprised expression, Qing Jun explained, "Our previous assumptions were wrong. We thought the formation and the Demon Binding Rope were two separate things, but they should actually be one. I changed my approach, and it worked!  Activating the rope instantly activates the formation; there's no need for prior setup. You try..."</p><p>Qing Jun handed the Demon Binding Rope to Qin Sang, guiding him on how to activate it.  It worked perfectly.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>"Even with the original formation diagram, the speed of deployment couldn't be faster than this! This makes the Demon Binding Rope much more practical! It's completely unexpected; even the strongest ancient demons would struggle to dodge it."</p><p>Qing Jun nodded. "Exactly. When I studied the formation, I focused on this aspect. Time was limited, and I haven't fully understood a portion of the formation yet. The Demon Binding Rope's current power is acceptable, usable at least!"</p><p>"There are still four years left; Senior Sister will certainly be able to further refine the formation," Qin Sang said expectantly.</p><p>He quickly memorized the formation diagram.  In the future, when restoring the Xuan Tie pillar, he could use Qing Jun's approach to recreate the Demon Sealing Stake.</p><p>With the Demon Binding Rope in hand, he felt much more confident facing Ye Lao Mo next time.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed in Peach Blossom Valley for a few days, cooperating with Qing Jun to study the Demon Binding Rope, before hurrying off to the Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>Forbidden Area, Yan Huo Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bing Han sat opposite each other, a mysterious white bronze object hovering between them.</p><p>Bing Han's eyes were closed, using secret techniques to examine it.</p><p>After a while, Bing Han slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>"What's your assessment?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>After much thought, he decided to consult Bing Han, a master refiner, before refining the object and ask for her assistance.</p><p>Bing Han pondered for a moment, then said, "Qin Daoist's analysis is correct; this is the furthest I can go. However, I have some ideas you might find helpful."</p><p>Qin Sang was relieved, repeatedly saying, "I hope you won't hesitate to offer guidance; I will surely show my gratitude!"</p><p>"Qin Daoist has invested so much effort; it seems you're refining an extraordinary treasure."</p><p>Bing Han glanced at the bronze, her tone changing. "However, I can only offer a few suggestions and take no credit. If you find them useful, I have a small request. Would you be willing to leave a copy of your insights on the art of refining at the Xu Ling Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed; he could do so right away.</p><p>He had learned refining techniques at Xu Ling Sect; this was just returning the favor.</p><p>Bing Han said, "The important thing is to act quickly; this matter isn't urgent. It can wait until after you've refined this treasure. Also, if you're willing to guide our younger disciples, that would be even better."</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment.  "After refining the treasure, I will hold a public lecture on refining techniques at the Yuan Shen Sect, to also organize my own understanding.  Disciples from Xu Ling Sect are welcome to attend!"</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>A figure flew out of the Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>His expression was relaxed, his eyes filled with a hint of joy, as if he had encountered something wonderful.</p><p>And indeed, he had!</p><p>Ten years of hard study, six years of preparation, and two years of seclusion in the mountain within a mountain.</p><p>With the help of his senior sister and Bing Han, and utilizing the power of demonic and fiery flames, he had finally refined the treasure!</p><p>Flying out of the Xu Ling Sect, Qin Sang paused slightly, opened his palm, summoned the treasure, admired it for a long time, let out a hearty laugh, and sped away, clearly very satisfied with his creation.</p><p>Shortly after his departure, the Xu Ling Sect was thrown into an uproar.  News of Qin Sang's upcoming public lecture spread like wildfire among the disciples.</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>The disciples of the Xu Ling School, Yuan Shen Sect, and Qing Yang Temple gathered at the Yuan Shen Sect, eager to attend this rare opportunity, regardless of their proficiency in artifact refinement.</p><p>Li Yu Fu had finished his tasks early and waited at the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng, Mei Gu, Tan Yi En, and others arrived one after another.</p><p>“Senior Brother, I heard Master will only lecture on artifact refinement this time, nothing else?”</p><p>Mei Gu, who had been traveling in the desert, rushed back after receiving Li Yu Fu’s message.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng was somewhat disappointed. “Not swordsmanship?”</p><p>After Qin Sang passed him the “Green Bamboo Sword Scripture,” he was left to comprehend it on his own. Even occasional guidance was minimal.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng knew Qin Sang was tempering him, but he didn't know what level he needed to reach to meet Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>“That’s right, only artifact refinement this time. However, don't worry.  In a few years, our Grandmaster will hold another teaching session!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu revealed a mysterious smile.</p><p>Everyone eagerly inquired about the reason.</p><p>“According to the custom of Bei Chen Realm, a Yuan Ying Grandmaster establishing a school widely invites fellow practitioners to the ceremony, enhancing their prestige, and at least publicly lectures for three days in return. Then, it will be a grand gathering of thousands of cultivators—a true spectacle. Today is merely a preview!”</p><p>Seeing Mei Gu and the others visibly excited, Li Yu Fu chuckled inwardly and continued, “The way of artifact refinement is also a great path.  Gaining insights will greatly benefit your future cultivation; that's why I urged you to return quickly.”</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>On a mountain in front of the Yuan Shen Sect’s restricted area.</p><p>Disciples from the three schools gathered on the mountain, sitting or standing, cultivators at the Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, and Golden Core stages, filling the mountain—a magnificent sight.</p><p>Even Bing Han and Qing Jun had left seclusion to attend.</p><p>The mountain was silent; everyone held their breath, eagerly watching the empty stone platform at the summit.</p><p>At that moment, demonic energy soared from outside the Yuan Shen Sect. Jing Yu, leading the demons of the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, had arrived to listen to the lecture.</p><p>Seeing the numerous demons, the Yuan Shen Sect and Xu Ling School disciples were momentarily in an uproar, but Li Yu Fu and others greeted them warmly.</p><p>Purple energy filled the east.</p><p>A figure appeared out of thin air on the stone platform.</p><p>Li Yu Fu stepped forward: “We welcome Grandmaster to begin the lecture on the Dao of Artifact Refinement!”</p><p>Everyone bowed down.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on the stone platform, nodding to his senior sister, Jing Yu, and Bing Han.  His gaze fell upon the cultivators of the three schools as he calmly said, “Today, we will only discuss artifact refinement.”</p>
