<h1>Chapter 1708: Forming the Seal</h1><p>The boat sailed the Western Desert.</p><p>Teleported to the Northern Sea.</p><p>Entered the storm belt.</p><p>Hurricane winds howled, and human figures flew through the tempest.</p><p>Before long, a golden light flew from the distance, revealing a dignified monk who pressed his palms together in a respectful greeting to Venerable Huiguang and the others.</p><p>"Xingzhi, has luring the ferocious beast gone smoothly?" Venerable Huiguang inquired.</p><p>"Reporting to Senior Uncle, good news has been pouring in from the front. The lures meticulously set by fellow Daoists from various sects have all proven effective.  There have been no casualties so far, but no one dares approach the beast either, so its true strength remains unknown…"</p><p>Xingzhi reported the situation in detail.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang nodded and glanced at the Azure Fox Holy King.</p><p>"Old monk, set up the formations here. Ensure there are no mishaps. This battle allows only victory, not defeat!" The Azure Fox Holy King stepped forward and vanished into the depths of the storm in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The others followed Venerable Huiguang and flew forward for a while. In the distance, they saw five towering pillars standing straight on the sea surface.</p><p>There were no islands beneath the pillars, and it was unclear what supported them. A cultivator sat in meditation atop each pillar.</p><p>The pillars were made of extraordinary materials, forged by the combined efforts of the human and demon races.  There was an identical set of five pillars and a group of formation guardians in the south, though they were not needed for the time being.</p><p>Before getting closer, the avatar discerned some clues. "The Golden Rainbow Formation, the Earth-Quelling Formation… all common Five Elements Formations in the cultivation world."</p><p>The avatar couldn't help but think of the Five Elements Divine Restrictions on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  These formations were not as profound as the Divine Restrictions, but they had the advantage of being controlled by cultivators, making them more flexible. Moreover, those who set up the formations were all experts.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang made arrangements. The main controllers of the Five Elements Formations were all eminent Buddhist monks.</p><p>Furthermore, a series of spirit formations with different functions were arranged in the outer perimeter, creating a net of heaven and earth.</p><p>The formations were quickly arranged.</p><p>Experts from various sides arrived one after another, all following the Buddhist arrangements. Some stayed in the outer perimeter where the pressure would be less intense. But others, wishing to experience the might of the ferocious beast up close and reflect on themselves, entered the Five Elements Formations.</p><p>The avatar chose to stay outside and saw Mo Xingdao being summoned into the Five Elements Formation by Venerable Huiguang.</p><p>"This poor monk and the Holy King must oversee the Five Elements to control the Five Elements Crown and cannot be distracted. When the beast appears, we will need Fellow Daoist's help to use your puppets to lure it into the trap," Venerable Huiguang instructed Mo Xingdao.</p><p>With numerous cultivators assisting here, and several eminent Buddhist monks presiding over the main formations, the two Nascent Soul cultivators could control the Five Elements Crown, freeing Mo Xingdao’s hands.</p><p>Unlike the beast hunt at the Eight Sceneries, this time, the lure needed to continuously engage and adjust to the beast. Others could only act when the beast was drawn to the nexus of the grand formation’s energy flow. There was no room for error to ensure complete success.  Apart from the two Nascent Soul cultivators, only puppets proficient in Yin-Yang Escape techniques could accomplish this.</p><p>With the trap set, everyone waited intently for the ferocious beast to appear.</p><p>No one noticed a figure quietly approaching.</p><p>Light as a swallow, Qin Sang bobbed on the water's surface, maintaining a safe distance as he gazed into the distance.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang closed his eyes and remained still.</p><p>Time passed day by day, yet a whole month went by without any sign of the beast.</p><p>Just as everyone was lost in their thoughts, worrying about potential mishaps, the Azure Fox Holy King finally returned.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A green shadow split the waves and rushed into the formation.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King’s voice was grave. "Be careful, the beast's cultivation might be beyond early Nascent Soul!"</p><p>Venerable Huiguang and Mo Xingdao’s expressions turned serious upon hearing this, but they showed no signs of retreat.</p><p>Regardless of the beast’s strength, they had to face the challenge.  No one knew when the next beast would arrive; they couldn't afford to wait any longer.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mo…"</p><p>Venerable Huiguang shifted his gaze. Mo Xingdao nodded, listened to the Azure Fox Holy King's description of the beast's divine abilities, and then flew out of the formation alone, towards the direction indicated by the Holy King, followed closely by a shadow.</p><p>'Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…'</p><p>The raging wind and waves continuously battered the pillars, causing them to slowly sink into the sea.</p><p>Everyone looked towards the depths of the storm, their minds tense.</p><p>Suddenly, a roar like a thunderbolt shook the heavens and earth. Judging by the sound, the beast was still some distance away.</p><p>However, the oppressive force of the roar penetrated the storm and transmitted through the water, leaving everyone feeling immensely stifled. Many were aghast, witnessing such a terrifying beast for the first time in their lives.</p><p>"Roar! Roar!"</p><p>The roars grew closer and closer.</p><p>Soon, cultivators proficient in spirit vision techniques saw a vision.</p><p>Distant waves surged, and a gigantic figure appeared within the storm.</p><p>Among those present were not only human cultivators but also demon kings.  Seeing the beast's colossal body, they couldn't help but recall the renowned Dragon Whale Great Sage of the Eastern Sea.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage, possessing the bloodline of the dragon whale, was hailed as the foremost Great Sage of the demon race, independent of the Holy King's Palace. Its true form was that of a dragon whale, its size unrivaled among the Eastern Sea demon race. Yet, compared to this beast, it seemed small and delicate.</p><p>A wall of water advanced towards them at an alarming speed, leaving the sea behind it pitch black.</p><p>The blackness was the beast's body, shaped like a manta ray, its two fleshy wings stretching endlessly.  A gentle flap of its wings sent forth mountain-like waves, its power comparable to the collapse of heaven and earth, chilling everyone to the bone.</p><p>In front of the beast, a human figure flickered in and out of existence.</p><p>Before the beast, this figure appeared exceptionally small. A casual wave from the beast could crush him to dust, yet he was incredibly tenacious, vanishing into thin air whenever an attack approached, only to reappear further ahead.</p><p>The beast was enraged by this elusive little insect and pursued it relentlessly.</p><p>"Activate the formation!"</p><p>Everyone simultaneously received Venerable Huiguang's warning.</p><p>The avatar's gaze darkened as he looked towards the beast, sensing that its oppressive force was even stronger than the one he had encountered before.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The figure luring the beast flickered once more, appearing very close to the formation upon its reappearance, rushing through a gap deliberately left for it.</p><p>As the puppet charged forward, it was suddenly enveloped by a shadow.</p><p>Everyone looked up in shock and horror, discovering that the beast had somehow flown into the sky, its wings like clouds covering the heavens.  Its left wing, carrying a terrifying wind pressure, aimed at the puppet and slammed down fiercely.</p><p>This was no ordinary wind pressure; it invoked the might of heaven and earth.  Any other being would have long lost the ability to resist.  Yet, the puppet vanished into thin air once more.</p><p>The moment the puppet disappeared, a five-colored crown abruptly materialized above the beast.</p><p>The difference in size between the two was vast, but the fluctuations emitted by the crown were no less potent.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang and the Azure Fox Holy King stood on either side of the crown.  The five pillars simultaneously shot out of the sea, and the Five Elements Formation manifested five different phenomena, distinct yet interconnected through the Five Elements Crown.  All the phenomena combined to form a gigantic five-colored canopy, covering the sky and shrouding the beast.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Streams of light burst forth from the Five Elements Crown, seemingly similar to before, yet possessing a different power.</p><p>The Forward and Reverse Five Elements Sealing and Severing Divine Light, forward for sealing, reverse for severing.</p><p>Back then, the ancient demon was intent on killing, using the Reverse Five Elements Divine Light from start to finish. Now, the priority was to imprison the beast.</p><p>Five-colored streams of light instantly enveloped the beast, its black body becoming multicolored. Layers of halos contracted, like layers of cages.</p><p>Not only that, as the Five Elements Crown exerted its power, sounds of something tearing through the air continued to ring out. Iron chains like蛟dragons shot into the formation, connecting with each other, crisscrossing and entwining around the beast, also possessing a sealing power.</p><p>The avatar was one of those manipulating the iron chains.</p><p>There were also other various phenomena. Everyone acted methodically, and various arrangements took effect one after another, sealing this space and the beast that had barged in.</p><p>Before this, anyone aware of the trap’s full design would believe it to be indestructible.</p><p>What followed, however, was a shocking scene.</p><p>Just as the cage was formed, the beast roared like thunder, and vast waves of smoke and mist suddenly erupted from its body, soaring into the sky like a bursting dam, powerful enough to shake heaven and earth.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!…’</p><p>More than half of the iron chains snapped. The pillars trembled, and while the Five Elements Crown remained relatively stable, the two Nascent Soul cultivators were visibly shaking.</p><p>Mo Xingdao reappeared in the distance, his heart pounding as he observed the scene.</p><p>He had experienced several close calls while luring the beast, exhausting all the treasures given to him by the two Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>He consumed a few pills to recover quickly and flew towards the battlefield.</p><p>Just as he was about to integrate into the formation, a voice suddenly transmitted, "Fellow Daoist Mo, do you happen to have the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit with you?"</p><p>It was Qin Sang, seeing a good opportunity, deciding to trade now!</p><p>Mo Xingdao paused slightly, his eyes flashing with surprise. "Fellow Daoist has brought the Five Elements Pill?"</p><p>After a brief exchange, Mo Xingdao remained on the periphery of the battlefield, remotely controlling his puppets to assist the others.</p><p>At this point, the confrontation had reached its most intense stage.</p><p>The beast unleashed its divine might, but the other side had meticulously laid a trap, with Nascent Soul cultivators presiding over it. How could it be breached so easily?</p><p>After the initial chaos, they gradually grasped the beast's attack patterns and adjusted accordingly.</p><p>The chains closed and snapped, repeating countless times. The avatar and the others who controlled the chains were also greatly exhausted.</p><p>"Prepare to merge the formations!"</p><p>Venerable Huiguang’s voice was deep and serious. This was the crucial step that would decide victory or defeat.  Once successful, they would have a fifty percent chance of capturing the beast alive. Of course, merging the formations also concealed hidden dangers.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Liu…"</p><p>The avatar looked at a tall, thin Daoist beside him. This person was an elder of the瓊Shadow Sect, said to hail from an overseas immortal island.</p><p>The surnamed Liu cultivator understood and took over control of the iron chains from the avatar.  Similar rotations were taking place elsewhere.</p><p>Those relieved of their duties retreated to recover. The avatar, however, retreated further and further, then turned and fled into the depths of the storm belt without looking back.  Some noticed his actions, dumbfounded.</p><p>Despite being at the crucial moment of merging the formations, the Azure Fox Holy King still glanced over, a hint of disdain flashing in her eyes, but she didn't bother to pay him any mind.</p><p>Just as Mo Xingdao felt surprised and bewildered, a voice suddenly whispered beside his ear, "Fellow Daoist Mo, it's been a while."</p><p>The voice was so close that Mo Xingdao’s back tensed, a chill running through his body. He abruptly turned his head and saw a figure that had materialized beside him at some point.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>He never expected Qin Sang to dare reveal his true self!</p><p>No, not his true self, but a phantom condensed from divine sense. This wasn't a simple divine sense manifestation; it had condensed into a true form!</p><p>Mo Xingdao fully extended his divine sense, becoming even more shocked.  This person's true body must be nearby, yet he hadn't detected it at all.</p><p>The phantom held a jade bottle, smiling at Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent and took out the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit.</p><p>They confirmed the authenticity of each other's treasures.</p><p>The phantom flickered and vanished, its destination unknown, leaving behind only a single sentence, "Many thanks for your cooperation, Fellow Daoist.  Until we meet again!"</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent, glancing at the fiercely contested battlefield. He wasn't sure if the two Nascent Soul cultivators had noticed Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, he turned to gaze at the endless storm, remaining silent for a moment before letting out a soft sigh.</p><p>In the distance, the true body and the avatar converged, storing away the treasures and leaving without hesitation.</p><p>"There was no demon king ambush…"</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.</p><p>To avoid any unforeseen complications, he chose to trade at that moment, cleverly selecting the crucial moment of merging the formations.</p><p>He had anticipated that the Azure Fox Holy King might order her subordinate demon kings to set an ambush. Qin Sang wouldn't mind killing a few demon kings along the way to enrich his treasury.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Azure Fox Holy King truly kept her word.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, despite having the title of Holy King, the Azure Fox Holy King didn't possess the true authority of one. Her bloodlust was too heavy, and she neglected external affairs. The larger clans within the Eastern Sea demon race feared her, but their submission was only superficial. In reality, they secretly colluded, paying lip service while defying her in secret.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King had limited usable demons under her command, and other demon kings might not be willing to offend a powerful enemy for her sake.</p><p>Unhindered all the way, escaping the storm belt, Qin Sang stopped dwelling on it and headed straight back to Deer Wilderness.</p><p>Spirit Gathering Formation, pills, spirit materials…</p><p>Various treasures were stored away one by one, yet Qin Sang didn't examine them immediately.</p><p>There was one thing he couldn't wait to do, having waited for his avatar’s return.</p><p>Deer Wilderness changed direction, traveling along the edge of the Northern Sea, directly westward.</p><p>It continued until it approached the storm belt, stopping in an uninhabited region in the west.</p><p>Qin Sang and his avatar flew out of Deer Wilderness, entering a desolate mountain range.</p><p>This was a location Qin Sang had specifically chosen to summon the Heavenly Demon.</p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p><p>Two figures flew above a basin.</p><p>The Nether Moon Guards stationed in the basin sensed their presence and flew up to greet them.</p><p>"Patrol the surroundings. No one is allowed to approach!"</p><p>Qin Sang gave a stern order and landed on the ground.</p><p>Several black, square platforms stood in the basin, their material indistinguishable.</p><p>There were seven platforms in total, arranged according to the positions of the Big Dipper.  There was nothing connecting the platforms, yet a mysterious aura flowed continuously between them.</p><p>This was the altar required by the *Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture*.  Rather than an altar, it was more like a special formation that could break through intangible barriers and summon Heavenly Demons from other realms.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed and landed in the position directly facing the handle of the dipper.</p><p>The avatar also approached, but stood behind Qin Sang, acting as a protector while also ready to replace him or ward off calamities.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his mind inward-focused. He sat in quiet meditation for a long time, silently circulating the secret art from the *Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture*.</p><p>The next moment, one of the seven platforms lit up with a black light.</p><p>Above the platform, within the black light, a mass of black qi twisted and contorted.</p><p>Then, the second platform showed signs of change.</p><p>The order in which the platforms changed wasn't strictly based on their distance from Qin Sang; there was no discernible pattern.</p><p>As more and more platforms underwent these changes, masses of black qi surrounded Qin Sang.  His consciousness subsequently fell into a hazy state, as if being pulled into the depths of the boundless void by a strange force.</p><p>He heard peculiar sounds, not human voices, but as if many strange energies were flowing within the void.</p><p>His mind was clear, not lost because of this, and he focused on recalling the scripture.</p><p>According to the scripture, when the secret art was complete and he made contact with a Heavenly Demon, there would be a special sensation.</p><p>However, as time passed and the secret art was completed, Qin Sang didn't sense anything unusual.</p><p>Just as he was thinking this, Qin Sang suddenly felt a chill descend.</p><p>"It's here!"</p>
