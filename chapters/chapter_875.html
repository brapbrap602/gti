<h1>Chapter 867: Star煞</h1><p>Chapter 867: Star煞</p><p>A young man surnamed Fang plunged into the forest, crashing through a swathe of ancient trees.</p><p>A muffled groan echoed from amidst the broken branches and tangled grass.  Fang, covered in leaves and debris, staggered to his feet. He shook his head, still feeling dizzy and disoriented.</p><p>Moments later, he jolted awake. Looking down, he saw that the life-saving talisman his master had given him was shattered, its power depleted.</p><p>He'd sensed danger and fled, but still got caught in the aftermath. The talisman had saved his life.</p><p>“This… this is the secret technique of the Lan Dou Sect, the  Lightning Control technique?”</p><p>Fang muttered to himself, his face filled with shock as he looked towards the center of the battlefield.  </p><p>Lightning filled the air.</p><p>He couldn’t see the battlefield clearly, but he knew the five cultivators he’d hired were likely dead.</p><p>He felt an immense wave of relief.  He’d been cautious, not daring to lead his men directly into the opponent's lair, instead using them as cannon fodder. Otherwise, it would have been his fellow disciples lying there dead.</p><p>As Fang prepared to leave, his vision blurred, and he felt dizzy again.</p><p>“What's going on?”</p><p>His heart pounded. He hurriedly checked his inner body and discovered an unknown, extremely cold, chaotic energy, a kind of unfamiliar煞气 (malignant energy).</p><p>This energy invaded his spiritual sea, assaulting his primordial spirit, causing it to destabilize and almost losing control of his true energy.</p><p>"Did it enter my body along with the lightning, without my noticing? What kind of power is this! The Lightning Control technique is the strongest technique I've ever seen, yet the Lan Dou Sect kept it hidden, classifying it as a forbidden technique!  The Dou Niu Peak lineage, who cultivated it, were expelled, becoming outcasts, removed from the sect…"</p><p>He hastily sat cross-legged, trying to expel the dark energy, when he heard his fourth junior brother's angry shout.</p><p>“Jin Hui Jia! You killed our junior brother!”</p><p>Fang froze. He suddenly remembered the tragic death of his master’s favorite junior brother decades ago, killed in the Demon Sea. The murderer was still at large, and he, as the eldest brother, had been severely punished by his master for failing to protect him.</p><p>He'd searched far and wide, and now, unexpectedly, the murderer was among these five!</p><p>He'd used them as expendable pawns, and now he'd inadvertently found the killer of his junior brother—a fortunate stroke of luck.</p><p>It was likely that Jin Hui Jia’s protective armor had saved the killer.  The armor was a gift from their master to the deceased junior brother; Fang knew its power well.</p><p>“Killed his junior brother and was still wearing his armor…”</p><p>Murderous intent flashed in Fang’s eyes, but burdened by the malignant energy, he couldn’t move.</p><p>…</p><p>Ma De Bao wielded the Tian Qian Wu Jue whip, leaping backward like a shrimp, using the recoil to his advantage. However, his respite was short-lived.  Like Fang, he suddenly fell into a dizzy spell.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>He clutched his head, his body stiffening, true energy chaotic. The whip trembled wildly, nearly slipping from his grasp.</p><p>When he discovered the unknown energy, he tried to expel it, but by then Kui Long had killed the other three and was upon him.</p><p>Terror filled his face, but under the assault of the unknown energy, his protective true energy dissipated, rendering him unable to control his weapon and offer any effective resistance.  Kui Long’s tail whipped the Tian Qian Wu Jue whip away, and then a ball of lightning from the beast engulfed him, ending his life.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang escaped the desolate island, sensing something unusual within himself.</p><p>Upon internal inspection, his Tian Mu butterfly seemed drunk, fluttering wildly in his dantian.</p><p>He was surprised, unsure why the butterfly behaved this way.</p><p>Poison in the lightning?</p><p>His spiritual sense scanned, detecting something odd, yet strangely familiar.</p><p>“Star煞?”</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the energy's nature. It was incredibly similar to the Star煞 energy he had absorbed while cultivating the *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, the same sinister, chaotic energy.</p><p>The Tian Mu butterfly was affected by this energy.</p><p>However, during his cultivation, the Star煞 was always blocked by the jade Buddha and slowly refined and expelled by him. It couldn't remain, so this Star煞 likely came with the lightning.</p><p>The Tian Mu butterfly had absorbed the lightning, along with the Star煞.</p><p>The supremely yang and righteous lightning, and the sinister, chaotic Star煞—why would such opposite forces merge?</p><p>Time was short. Qin Sang hastily helped the Tian Mu butterfly expel the Star煞.</p><p>Qin Sang had extensive experience dealing with Star煞, and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had only absorbed a small portion of the lightning, causing minimal impact. He easily stabilized the butterfly's spirit.</p><p>Then, an angry shout came from ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently and saw a dark-robed figure wielding a strange banner emerging from the turbulent waters, advancing towards him with a furious gaze.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang spotted other figures in the same attire, all dark-robed individuals holding identical banners, their auras intertwined.</p><p>"Golden Light Armor? Junior Brother?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled the incident.  During the Witch Clan unrest, he had been pursued and ambushed in the Demon Sea.  After killing his attackers, he escaped immediately. Later, Ran Luo mentioned that they were quite influential, direct disciples of the Black Serpent Mountain ancestor of the Witch Clan.</p><p>Elder Zou and Ran Luo used the resources of the Merchant League to cover for him, preventing further trouble.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they encountered each other in the Inner Sea, his identity revealed by the Golden Light Armor.</p><p>"They are disciples of Black Serpent Mountain, all Witch Clan members!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.</p><p>This was the heartland of the human race.  Most Witch Clan cultivators were active in the Southeast Sea near the Witch God Continent. Why were they here?</p><p>Their prepared banner formations indicated it wasn't a coincidence.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that something had gone wrong with his companions on this monster-hunting mission, most likely the Fang surname young man who organized it.</p><p>This person was either a Witch Clan spy or a Witch Clan member!</p><p>The cultivation world held countless treasures; it wasn't strange that items existed to conceal one's identity and bypass the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's perception.</p><p>Combined with the mysterious individuals wielding strange lightning magic, Qin Sang felt the shadow of a vast conspiracy looming over him, countless mysteries swirling in his mind.</p><p>The dark-robed men blocked his path, contacted their fellow disciples, then turned to attack Qin Sang with their strange banners.</p><p>Seeing the danger, Qin Sang quickly dismissed his distracting thoughts. Without pausing, he flashed towards the blocking dark-robed men.</p><p>He finally saw the banners clearly.</p><p>The dark fabric seemed to contain the spirits of numerous beasts, wild, ferocious, and bloodthirsty.  The banners themselves exuded a strong, malevolent aura; they were no ordinary objects.</p><p>Eighty-one Beast King Banners, clearly a unified set, their power undoubtedly comparable to the Heavenly Cold Gale Array.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that if trapped, he would be helpless.</p>
