<h1>Chapter 2251 Past Events</h1><p>The stone pavilion in the Yan Yue Nunnery was meticulously crafted by the nuns. Its design was quite unique.  The pavilion before me was an exact replica, even down to the smallest detail in its construction.</p><p>The only difference lay in the materials. The Yan Yue Nunnery used spiritual materials, while this pavilion was made of ordinary stone and wood. Even so, they were clearly high-quality materials, even by worldly standards. Despite years of neglect, they showed only superficial weathering, no rot.</p><p>Could such a coincidence exist? One pavilion in a small, distant world; the other in a dreamlike ancient realm.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, Qin Sang noticed a lack of wear and tear within the pavilion, suggesting it had been abandoned shortly after construction.</p><p>The courtyard containing the pavilion was larger than the estates of even the wealthiest local families.  It boasted bridges, streams, pavilions, and towers—a harmonious landscape that changed subtly with every step. This stood in stark contrast to the ostentatious mansions nearby. Despite its decay, it was clear the owner possessed considerable wealth and refined taste—a rare combination in such a place.</p><p>The owner must have poured significant effort into building this courtyard.  It’s a mystery why it was abandoned.</p><p>Years of wind and rain had taken their toll. Most of the structures in the courtyard were dilapidated and crumbling, long deserted.</p><p>Amidst the ruins, Qin Sang noticed some unusual details.  A fleeting movement and she stood before the main hall.</p><p>The main hall was the most damaged, its roof completely collapsed, leaving only the framework. Standing at the entrance, Qin Sang gently brushed away the dust from the doorway, revealing slender, long scratches.</p><p>These were the marks of swords!</p><p>Qin Sang traced the marks with her finger, her eyes gleaming. She then used her spiritual sense to carefully scan the entire courtyard before turning to leave.</p><p>Beyond the courtyard lay a wide road, wide enough for carriages, yet overgrown with weeds.  Following this mountain path downwards, past a bamboo grove, she came across fields.</p><p>As dawn broke, Qin Sang noticed a shirtless farmer working in the fields, the rising sun illuminating his bronze skin.</p><p>Only when Qin Sang approached the field did the farmer notice him, startled.</p><p>“Greetings, sir,” Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>“N-no… I… I dare not…”</p><p>The farmer, a simple man, hastily returned the bow. Seeing Qin Sang’s refined appearance and bearing, he relaxed slightly, glancing cautiously towards the mountain, and whispered, “Sir, did you just come down from up there?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Yes. I passed by the foot of the mountain last night and saw the large estate. I wanted to spend the night there, but found it deserted and abandoned, so I made do in a ruined building.”</p><p>Hearing this, the farmer’s jaw dropped. “Sir, you’re so brave!”</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled. “An unoccupied abandoned house; what does that have to do with bravery?”</p><p>The farmer exclaimed, “Sir, you must be from out of town! You don’t know… this is a terribly ominous house! You…”</p><p>Before he could finish, a gust of mountain wind swept by, carrying a chill. The farmer shivered, his face paling. He bowed repeatedly towards the mountain, “I shouldn't have said anything! I shouldn't have! Please forgive my loose tongue, ancestors! Spare my life!”</p><p>As if fearing retribution from vengeful spirits, the farmer grabbed his hoe and hurried down the mountain, abandoning his work.</p><p>Qin Sang already suspected something and her heart sank. She followed the farmer down to the main road at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>More and more people appeared on the road. The farmer wiped the sweat from his brow. Seeing Qin Sang still beside him, he kindly advised, “Sir, please leave! It’s good you made it through last night, but don’t enter just any house in the future!”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned curiosity.  “May I ask, sir, what happened back then that makes you so afraid?”</p><p>“Oh dear…”</p><p>Unable to refuse any longer, the farmer cautiously looked around before whispering, “One night, an entire family was wiped out, every single person. Even the maids…  Isn't that terrifying? I heard that several people who went to see the commotion the next day went mad on the spot! It’s been decades, and no one dares go near the place. People don’t even dare mention it…”</p><p>Qin Sang pressed for more details, but the farmer refused to say another word.</p><p>Qin Sang then offered a silver coin. “To be honest, sir, I travel far and wide, collecting strange tales. Please, do me a favor. I swear I won't reveal your identity.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The farmer, unable to resist the lure of money, steeled his resolve. “Sir, if you want to hear the story, come home with me. My father knows even more.”</p><p>The man's home was on the outskirts of town.  His yard was old but meticulously clean. His wife bustled about preparing food, while an elderly man basked in the sun in a reclining chair, two children nestled at his feet, a picture of domestic harmony.</p><p>"Sir, please come in and have a seat. I'll discuss this with my father," the man invited Qin Sang inside, then went out to persuade the elder.</p><p>Their conversation wasn't lost on Qin Sang. He sensed their apprehension: fear of vengeful spirits, fear of attracting the killer's attention, and, far more importantly, the latter.</p><p>Money talks.</p><p>Finally, the son convinced the old man, who entered the room, his cloudy eyes fixed on Qin Sang. "Young man, you want to hear a story?"</p><p>"Please, old sir, have a seat!"</p><p>Qin Sang helped the old man sit down and listened intently.</p><p>"Old age has weakened me.  Back in my day, I was a strong man! I could lift a stone this big with one hand!"</p><p>The old man gestured, his eyes gleaming with reminiscence, before sighing softly. "In my youth, I was a stonemason, quite skilled. Wealthy families competed for my services."</p><p>"Did you build that courtyard?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"No," the old man shook his head. "It was there since before my time. I only built a pavilion for them."</p><p>"A pavilion? The one on the mountain ridge?"</p><p>"That's the one.  Don't underestimate it; it was a magnificent undertaking!  The stones were solid slabs of blue-grey stone, the wood, thick fragrant camphor, specially transported from  Da Zhang Prefecture!  Mr. Ning's elderly daughter, they were overjoyed to have her, and he had that pavilion built especially for her.  They say the design was drawn by the young Miss Ning herself, but it was probably the wife trying to please her husband.  The girl was so young, even if she was exceptionally clever, how could she possibly have drawn such a beautiful pavilion, such intricate designs? I've only seen it once in my life."</p><p>The old man recounted.</p><p>"Ning? Miss Ning?"</p><p>Qin Sang pressed for details, finding the timeline consistent.</p><p>The surname 'Ning' was significant; a coincidence?  Ning Zhenren had sent Liuli, surely leaving some means of help, not relying entirely on him?</p><p>Was it truly Liuli?</p><p>Liuli, falling into a delusion during her ordeal, wouldn't have recovered her senses as quickly as he did, yet she specifically remembered that pavilion.</p><p>The pavilion marked a turning point in his relationship with Liuli, deeply meaningful, evidently so to her as well.</p><p>Before that, Liuli had deliberately avoided him, even cutting her hair to seek refuge in Buddhism.</p><p>Since Qin Sang had confessed his feelings in the pavilion, subsequently forced to ascend, Liuli remained in the mortal realm, not only tending to Qingyang Temple, but also tacitly accepting the title of "Shi Niang" (Mistress) from Yu Fu and others, demonstrating a change of heart.</p><p>Perhaps Liuli had decided to stop agonizing over whether her feelings were genuine or influenced by demonic power, making a firm resolve.</p><p>Were it not for fate's cruel hand, leading to Liuli's despair, they might have become Daoist partners.</p><p>They say heart demons often stir the most poignant memories. The pavilion's appearance in the delusion suggested that if Miss Ning was Liuli, her heart demon wasn't Master Bing Yao, but was connected to him!</p><p>Qin Sang felt both joy and sorrow.</p><p>He rejoiced that since the heart demon was himself, he would likely find it easier to help Liuli overcome it.</p><p>His sorrow lay in Liuli's whereabouts.</p><p>"Mr. Ning, not long after moving here, became a renowned philanthropist.  Then, who knows what powerful figure he offended? It's one thing to seek wealth, but to murder an entire family… such wickedness!  Sooner or later, retribution will come! Only an old fool like me would dare to say this.  If you ask others about the Ning family, no one will dare speak." The old man sighed.</p><p>He then shared more about the Ning family, but offered nothing crucial, much of it hearsay.</p><p>However, Qin Sang sensed the old man knew more.</p><p>After repeated questioning, the old man finally relented. "Years after that great case, I was conscripted into the city to work at the magistrate's office.  They said a just magistrate came, trained the city guard, personally led raids into the mountains, killing many bandits.  Whether he eliminated those responsible for the Ning family tragedy is unknown, but nothing like that happened afterward.  Some of the city guards who served under that just magistrate must still be alive. You could try inquiring in the city. That's all I know, and you must never say you heard it from me."</p><p>The old man's worry was understandable. If the killer were still alive and discovered someone investigating, they too could be implicated.</p><p>Qin Sang promised not to reveal anything. Leaving the old man's house, she waited until the townsfolk were asleep.  She then used a captivating spell to make them reveal their memories related to the Ning family. She discovered that the townspeople knew very little about the Ning family, their memories mostly centered on the massacre.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang left the town and headed straight for the prefecture city.</p><p>The prefecture city was dozens of times larger than the town, but Qin Sang sensed the presence of a cultivator in the prefecture government office.</p><p>Inside the prefecture government office, a secluded courtyard had been specially created.  A spirit array was set up within the courtyard, unknown to the officials, soldiers, and servants of the prefecture government.</p><p>A middle-aged cultivator was practicing in his private room when he suddenly felt a presence, opened his eyes in surprise, and quickly left his room, flying into the air.  "I am Liu Chengping of the Dong Liang Sect. I apologize for not greeting you, senior. Please forgive my oversight.”</p><p>Liu Chengping was terrified.  The mysterious person's aura was as imposing as a mountain; his cultivation might even surpass his master's.</p><p>"How long have you been stationed here?" Qin Sang examined him.  The presence of a cultivator made things easier.</p><p>"Not long. Twenty years ago, I was sent here by my master to prevent evil spirits from causing trouble.  My term is almost over, and I am about to return to the mountain to report," Liu Chengping replied, inwardly cursing himself for not leaving earlier.</p><p>"Twenty years? Who was here before you?"</p><p>"It was Wen… my junior brother…"</p><p>Liu Chengping answered each question.  He continued, "The other races targeted our human race. Worried about demonic spies infiltrating the human world and causing havoc, our sect started sending disciples down the mountain to guard various places. Before that, we rarely interfered with the mortal world, and the sect strictly forbade us from showing our abilities in front of ordinary people."</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated.  According to Liu Chengping, there were no cultivators in the city when the Ning family incident occurred.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang silent, Liu Chengping cautiously asked, "Senior, what is your purpose? Is there anything I can help with?"</p><p>"I am investigating a massacre that happened decades ago! The victims were old friends of mine. I was in seclusion for many years and only learned about this upon leaving…"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was heavy with sorrow.</p><p>Liu Chengping was immediately shocked and listened intently as Qin Sang recounted the story.</p><p>After hearing the story, Liu Chengping immediately responded, "Although we weren't here at the time, the prefecture government should have records. I will check immediately! The Ning family migrated from elsewhere; there must be clues. One of my senior brothers is stationed in the capital city. I will immediately write to him and ask for his help in the investigation!"</p><p>He dared not refuse. Even if the sect learned about this, they would surely order a thorough investigation. This was Dong Liang Sect's territory. If the relatives of this powerful mysterious person were killed here and the culprit was not found,  it would bring disaster upon the Dong Liang Sect.</p><p>"I presume you wouldn't dare deceive me. I will wait for your news here! If the mastermind is found to be a cultivator, regardless of his identity, I will not let him off lightly! And if your Dong Liang Sect dares to protect him…"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice turned cold.</p><p>Feeling Qin Sang's killing intent, Liu Chengping's heart trembled. He nodded in agreement, quickly returned to the prefecture government to make arrangements, and then left the city.</p><p>This event caused a huge uproar, mobilizing the entire nation's resources and even involving the Dong Liang Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was not only to find the murderer; she also held a glimmer of hope that there might be survivors from that night at the Ning residence.</p><p>This was an illusion. If Liuli was killed, she might not have truly died, but finding her would be like searching for a needle in a haystack. This time, it relied on luck...</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang paused. Was it really just luck?</p><p>"Yin and Yang Dao... Yin and Yang Dao..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to herself.</p><p>The Chunqiu Gui was a treasure of the Yin and Yang Dao.  The Yuji Mountain had a legacy of Yin and Yang Dao, and Liuli had been reborn near Yuji Mountain.</p><p>Thinking back, before the illusion erupted, the Chunqiu Gui had also entered the illusory realm.</p><p>If not for this accident, Liuli, being so close, might have had the opportunity to receive the Yuji Mountain inheritance earlier. In other words, could the Chunqiu Gui have played a role behind the scenes?</p><p>Thoughts flooded her mind, but she couldn't solve her current predicament.</p><p>If Miss Ning was still alive, one day, she would surely return to her hometown. It would be best if someone stayed here for her.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop Yuji Mountain, deep in thought.</p><p>"Hey up there! How did you get up there? Are you a god?"</p><p>A voice called from below.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the boy clinging to the cliff face.  "Yes."</p><p>"Uh…"</p><p>The boy hadn't expected Qin Sang to admit it so readily.  He was stunned for a moment, then excitedly said, "You're really a god? Did you fly up using magic?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "If you can climb up here, I will teach you this magic."</p>
