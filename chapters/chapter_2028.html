<h1>Chapter 2019: The Crimson Dress</h1><p>Chapter 2020: The Crimson Dress</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the course of his acquaintance with Su Nu.</p><p>The first time, at Yue Xianggu's invitation, he brought Su Nu back. At that time, he was unwilling to meddle in other people's affairs and chose to turn a blind eye to Su Nu's subtle actions. Later, they met again in the Seven Kills Hall. Su Nu handed him the Ghost Seal and asked for his help. In reality, there was almost no exchange, more like a transaction.</p><p>Both times were coincidental. Finally, they shared adversity during the Demon Sealing War, but Su Nu had already been possessed by an Ancient Demon, unconscious and unaware.</p><p>That these two people would meet again in the Great Thousand World, and both reach such considerable heights, could only be described as the unpredictable nature of fate.</p><p>“Su Nu…”</p><p>Su Nu called him Brother Qin, so Qin Sang couldn’t continue addressing her as fellow Daoist and simply called her name.</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang asked, “What kind of impression did the lower realm leave on you?”</p><p>Since Su Nu took the initiative to reopen old wounds and bring up the past, Qin Sang took the opportunity to ask and see how she felt about the lower realm.</p><p>Before the Demon Sealing War, Su Nu had suffered greatly. Although the Demon Lord was the mastermind, the three great merchant alliances of the Canglang Sea and Yue Xianggu were accomplices.</p><p>If Su Nu harbored resentment towards the lower realm, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>“Lower realm? Brother Qin, are you referring to the Canglang Sea?”</p><p>Su Nu, quick-witted, immediately understood Qin Sang's meaning. She sighed softly, her voice low, “To be honest, Brother Qin, until I entered the Seven Kills Hall and learned the truth, my heart was filled with resentment. I secretly swore that once I escaped the demon's grasp and possessed the power of revenge, I would slaughter the three great merchant alliances. I even thought that there wasn't a single good person in the entire Canglang Sea, the entire world, that they all owed me, and that only ‘killing’ could bring me catharsis! Until I met Brother Qin…”</p><p>“Brother Qin didn't treat me as a soul slave. He took the initiative to destroy the Ghost Seal and entrusted me to the Four Saints Palace. In the Four Saints Palace, the Bao siblings treated me well, healed my injuries, and allowed me to cultivate there. Although I wasn't a disciple of the Four Saints Palace, they treated everyone equally. Cave residences, pills, magical treasures, and so on, could all be obtained through effort, just like other disciples… I finally learned what the life of a normal cultivator was like, knew that the world wasn't entirely dark, and the resentment in my heart gradually dissipated, allowing me to break through to the Nascent Soul stage…”</p><p>Su Nu reminisced about the past, her eyes gentle. Even after a thousand years, she still remembered every detail vividly.</p><p>Before and after the Demon Sealing War, her circumstances had undergone earth-shattering changes. She had walked out of the darkness without a glimmer of light, into the sunlight, a crucial turning point in her life, one she could never forget.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu's expression, Qin Sang nodded secretly. It seemed that the resentment in her heart had disappeared, and she no longer held a grudge.</p><p>In this case, he could tell her about the ascension of the Storm Realm and perhaps invite her to accompany him to the Mist Sea to assist him. Even if his identity were exposed and he was forced to flee, Su Nu could take Gu Ya back and look after the Storm Realm.</p><p>However, having just reunited, Qin Sang didn’t bring it up immediately. The human heart was unpredictable, and he still needed to observe.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang’s thoughts, Su Nu let out a soft breath, her mind drawn away from her memories. She asked with some curiosity, “Before Brother Qin ascended, you must have traveled all over the lower realm. I wonder how many places similar to the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea are there? Where does Brother Qin come from?”</p><p>Back then, before she had the ability to leave the Canglang Sea, she was taken to the Great Thousand World by the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>“As far as I know, the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea are very close and can be considered the same sea. Besides them, there’s the Northern Sea, the Western Lands, which are almost entirely land, and the Central Continent, the largest and most powerful, which is located on the opposite end of a vast continent from the Western Lands. The path of ascension is located within the Return to Ruin…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly described the Storm Realm.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang was also curious if there were any other large refuges in the Storm Realm. Upon asking Gu Ya, he learned that there were indeed only the Northern Sea, the Central Continent, the Western Lands, the Canglang Sea, and the Demon Sea. Did this mean that there were only five Sword Pavilions left?</p><p>Su Nu was a little surprised. “The Northern Sea and the Canglang Sea are so far apart! And there's the Storm Chasm. How did Brother Qin get here back then? Could it be…”</p><p>“Indeed, the Violet Firmament Palace is located in the Northern Zenith Realm, one of the four realms of the Northern Sea. The Violet Firmament Palace and the Seven Kills Hall are connected,” Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>“No wonder…”</p><p>Su Nu murmured, then said thankfully, “Brother Qin also came here after receiving the news of the Violet Firmament Palace’s emergence, right? Fortunately, there’s the Sword Pavilion; otherwise, I don’t know when I would have been able to thank Brother Qin in person.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that Su Nu was right. He had received a lot of good news shortly after arriving. “The Sword Pavilion in the Western Lands has never been discovered, and its name is unknown. The Central Continent has the Heavenly Appearance and Heavenly Together Sword Pavilions, but unfortunately, I haven't been inside either. However, I’ve entered the Violet Firmament Palace three times and have also browsed some ancient texts in Central Continent sects. And you understand the Seven Kills Hall. If we join forces to explore the Sword Pavilion fragments, we might have unexpected gains.”</p><p>“That’s exactly what I had in mind!”</p><p>Su Nu smiled sweetly. “There are several places I could only look at from afar, which should be from the Sword Pavilions Brother Qin mentioned. This time, with Brother Qin, we’ll definitely be able to sweep clean all the treasures inside!”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled noncommittally. His true goal wasn't the treasures of the Sword Pavilion, but if the opportunity arose, he wouldn't mind taking a detour.</p><p>And there was one more thing…</p><p>Qin Sang channeled a wisp of True Essence, conjuring an image between them. It was a mountain peak filled with a mysterious aura.</p><p>The Heavenly Mountain of the Violet Firmament Palace!</p><p>Liuli's master, Bing Yao, was trapped on Heavenly Mountain and ascended with the Violet Firmament Palace.</p><p>He had promised Liuli that he would help her find her master. At the Jade Gate Pass and during his conversations with Qu Zhen, he had specifically inquired about it, but there was no news of Heavenly Mountain. The news that could reach the Jade Gate Pass was no secret, and Qu Zhen and the others, limited by their cultivation, didn’t dare to venture too deep.  It seemed that Su Nu had been in the Abundant Desolation Jade Gate for many years and must know more about the more hidden Sword Pavilion fragments.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's solemn expression, Su Nu stared at the image, observing it for a long time, then gently shook her head. “I haven't seen a mountain like this! However, the Sword Pavilion fragments were ravaged by the Void Storm during ascension and are all disfigured. There are many broken and collapsed Immortal Mountains. I'll take Brother Qin to look for them. Maybe we can find it.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his True Essence, thinking to himself that if Heavenly Mountain was the core area of the Violet Firmament Palace, it might not have separated from the palace and was still sealed. He wondered if Bing Yao had seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang remembered Qu Zhen and said, “I didn’t come here solely for the Sword Pavilion fragments. I also hired a few helpers. One of them is waiting outside. I'll let him act on his own first.”</p><p>Qin Sang flashed out, found Qu Zhen, brought him to a safe area, and instructed him to meet up with the others.</p><p>Su Nu secretly followed behind and reappeared after Qu Zhen left.  She said, “Brother Qin, I’ve selected a few of the Sword Pavilion fragments. Why don’t we go to those places first?”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>With that, the two immediately set off.</p><p>Su Nu also had the cultivation of early Void Refinement and didn't need Qin Sang to look after her. The two moved at high speed, constantly venturing deeper.  After some twists and turns, they arrived at the first Sword Pavilion fragment.</p><p>The Sword Pavilion fragment floated quietly in the void, emitting a faint white light in the darkness, very conspicuous. It was eerily quiet inside, as if there was no one there.  This was already an area that Nascent Soul cultivators dared not set foot in.  If anyone came here, they would undoubtedly be Void Refinement experts or above.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang and Su Nu joining forces, they dared not let their guard down and cautiously observed for a while before quietly approaching the Sword Pavilion fragment.</p><p>At the very center of the fragment was a collapsed mountain peak, reduced to a pile of rubble. The area around the peak was a mess, but they could sense a profound formation, its power still lingering.</p><p>“Has Brother Qin been here before?” Su Nu asked expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently for a while, then slowly shook his head. This wasn’t any place he remembered; he couldn’t determine if it came from the Violet Firmament Palace or another Sword Pavilion.</p><p>This was normal.  His three entries into the Violet Firmament Palace were cursory, and even powerful places like the Eight Sceneries Palace and Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, he had only explored a small part of the Heavenly Appearance and Heavenly Together Halls.</p><p>The two didn't stay long and went to the next fragment. Several in a row had nothing to do with Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>They weren't just searching for Heavenly Mountain but also for suitable Sword Pavilion fragments to explore.</p><p>Some of these fragments were in conspicuous locations, having been visited by many people, making it unlikely that opportunities remained. Others were rarely visited, which meant they must be very dangerous, requiring careful planning. They planned to visit them all, analyze the situation, and then take action.</p><p>As the two old friends, separated for a thousand years, traveled together, the strangeness between them gradually faded, making their experiences a thousand years ago all the more precious.</p><p>"The previous fragment resembled a place recorded in the Eight Sceneries Palace. We might as well..."</p><p>Qin Sang was discussing the previous fragment with Su Nu when they arrived at the next fragment.  Seeing the scene within, his gaze suddenly fixed, and his expression drastically changed.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's expression, Su Nu looked forward in surprise. Was this the place Brother Qin was looking for?</p><p>Before them lay a piece of land almost reduced to ruins. At the edge of the land was a broken mountain. This mountain must have been majestic in the past, but now only a part of the shattered base remained, the upper part of the mountain completely gone, as if erased by a powerful force.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang landed in front of the broken mountain.</p><p>Back then, Liuli had held back Duke Dongyang and given him an escape route. He had fled down the mountain alone, and even now, recalling that experience, he still felt a lingering fear. Although it was now disfigured, Qin Sang could still recognize it. This was Heavenly Mountain!</p><p>The remains of Heavenly Mountain!</p><p>The cultivators of the Northern Zenith Realm thought Heavenly Mountain was mysterious and unpredictable, the most important place within the Violet Firmament Palace.  Who would have thought that Heavenly Mountain was likely just a peripheral location of the Violet Firmament Palace!</p><p>Heavenly Mountain had separated from the Violet Firmament Palace, and it wasn't merely damaged, but almost leveled.</p><p>Those within the mountain…</p><p>Qin Sang stared blankly at the broken mountain, a stubborn, pretty face flashing through his mind.  He was speechless for a moment.  Feeling Su Nu land beside him, he asked in a heavy voice, "If there were people in the mountain, would it have been possible for them to survive the ascension?"</p><p>Su Nu spread her divine sense, carefully sweeping over the broken mountain. Her voice was heavy.  "The state of this mountain indicates that during ascension, facing the chaotic Void currents, it had almost no power to resist."</p><p>The meaning of these words was clear.</p><p>Su Nu was a firsthand witness. No one knew better than her how terrifying that scene had been.</p><p>Bing Yao was trapped on Heavenly Mountain, without an Ascension Platform, without the Demon Lord to share the pressure.  Heavenly Mountain itself was leveled.  She had almost no chance of survival!</p><p>Su Nu hesitated for a moment, then asked, “That person… was Brother Qin’s friend?”</p><p>“An old friend.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. He finally knew Liuli’s whereabouts, but this ‘gift’ of reunion was far too cruel.</p><p>Her master was Liuli’s spiritual pillar.  She had waited for a thousand years, searched painstakingly for a lifetime, and was willing to sacrifice everything, even her own life, to rescue her master, only to receive such a cruel outcome.</p><p>“Please accept my condolences, Brother Qin,” Su Nu softly consoled, standing quietly by his side.</p><p>After a long while, the figure in front of the broken mountain disappeared, leaving behind a soft sigh, gradually dispersed by the wind.</p><p>…</p><p>"Brother Qin, this is a map I drew myself. These marked locations are relatively safe and can serve as temporary resting places. I will be in secluded cultivation here..."</p><p>Su Nu conjured a map and pointed to a point of light. "After I'm done with those people, let's meet here."</p><p>The two wandered through the Abundant Desolation Jade Gate, visiting many Sword Pavilion fragments, until it was time for Qin Sang's agreed meeting with Young Master Xin.  They had agreed to meet every so often to exchange their findings, so Qin Sang bid farewell to Su Nu, leaving for a while.</p><p>The value of this map was self-evident.  Qin Sang hadn't expected Su Nu to even tell him her usual cultivation location. He was about to thank her when Su Nu, as if anticipating it, smiled faintly. "Brother Qin, are you still being polite with me?"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, dispensing with further formalities, cupped his hands, and transformed into a streak of light, flying away.</p><p>Watching the departing light, the smile on Su Nu’s face gradually faded, her delicate brows furrowing slightly, a hint of puzzlement in her eyes.</p><p>After gazing for a long time, she sighed softly and turned to leave.  However, she didn't go to the location marked on the map but instead arrived at a Small Thousand World heavily shrouded in illusory scenery created by divine abilities.</p><p>The scene within the Small Thousand World was astonishing, a true spectacle.</p><p>Towering stone tablets stood upon the earth, a seemingly endless forest of steles, forming an unimaginably vast stone tablet formation.</p><p>Su Nu’s figure flickered, arriving at the center of the formation where a stone platform covered in runes was located.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the platform, Su Nu untied the beaded bracelet on her left wrist and tossed it upwards.  The beads scattered, and one jade bead slowly rose, emitting a bright light like a hanging moon, radiating strange fluctuations. It was undoubtedly a rare treasure.</p><p>Then, Su Nu formed a hand seal, her face suddenly turning pale.  Her vital blood was forced out, dripping onto the stone platform, flowing along the runes, staining the entire platform red.  The bloody light continued to spread outwards.</p><p>An astonishing scene unfolded. Thin blood threads quickly climbed up the stone tablets, spreading throughout the entire formation.  The earth trembled violently, and bloody light shot into the sky.</p><p>The jade bead, as if enveloped by a sea of blood, shone brighter and brighter, undergoing a strange transformation.</p><p>Su Nu’s lips were completely devoid of color, her aura extremely weak, yet she still exerted all her strength to perform the hand seals.</p><p>Finally, the jade bead transformed into something resembling a round mirror.  The mirror’s surface was initially chaotic, then gradually became clearer, revealing a blurry image, as if transmitted from a distant unknown.</p><p>Within the mirror, there was an icy throne, and upon the throne sat a monarch.</p><p>Although the image was very blurry, and the face couldn’t be seen clearly, one thing was certain: this monarch was a woman of unparalleled beauty.</p><p>Most striking was the crimson dress she wore.</p><p>Her posture was slightly languid. The crimson dress was as fiery as flames, yet it didn’t seem out of place at all, like the noble air of a Vermilion Bird, like the supreme majesty of a monarch.</p><p>Su Nu’s expression was solemn, a trace of reverence flashing in her eyes.  She bowed her head.  “Reporting to Your Majesty, I have found him…”</p><p>Before she could finish, the mirror shattered.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The stone tablet forest crumbled, destroyed along with the jade bead.</p><p>The loss of a vast stone tablet formation, a rare treasure jade bead, and all the vital blood of a Void Refinement cultivator seemed to be only for the sake of delivering this one sentence.</p><p>Su Nu herself was utterly weakened, collapsing into the pool of blood, unconscious.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
