<h1>Chapter 794: Gu Mountain Island</h1><p>Chapter 794: Gu Mountain Island</p><p>A swirling vortex appeared in the hurricane above the wasteland.</p><p>The passage was slowly shrinking, the spirit array breaking the immortal array was being destroyed, and everyone had to leave the Seven Killing Hall before the passage disappeared.</p><p>In the wasteland, the withered grass swayed.</p><p>A figure appeared without warning.  The person looked around cautiously, then turned into a streak of light, shooting towards the passage.</p><p>Before entering the passage, the person activated a jade talisman for protection and vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed this. He wasn't in a hurry to leave, preparing his own jade talisman and waiting quietly on the outer edge of the wasteland.</p><p>Then, he took out a bone flute from his Qianjun ring.</p><p>He still couldn't determine if the flute was a magic treasure or something else. But it was certain that it wasn't from this world; otherwise, the fragments wouldn't be so far apart.</p><p>The bone flute was mysterious, able to connect with the power of the stars, but it didn't exhibit the power expected of a precious artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the bronze piece he obtained for Yun Youzi at the Ziwei Palace.  The piece, a fragment of an immortal cauldron, remained incredibly heavy and even intimidated the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang toyed with the bone flute, staring intently at the wasteland.</p><p>Time passed slowly. Cultivators returned from the depths of the Seven Killing Hall one after another, flying into the passage. During this time, Qin Sang saw Madam Liu again, but he didn't speak, just watching her leave.</p><p>In this process, he didn't see Xiang Yi. If Xiang Yi died inside, it would be a good thing, saving him a lot of trouble.</p><p>Compared to what he saw on Dongmen Island, far fewer cultivators successfully left the Seven Killing Hall; clearly, many had perished.</p><p>While waiting, Qin Sang remained observant. He saw several figures that seemed to be Yuan Ying cultivators, making him even more cautious about revealing himself.  He stayed so far away precisely to avoid misunderstandings.</p><p>"Fewer and fewer people…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The passage was half the size it was when he arrived. He didn't have much time left.</p><p>"If that person died in the Seven Killing Hall, the hope of restoring the bone flute would be slim. The Seven Killing Hall is so large; it's impossible to search it inch by inch. I only hope he left earlier and that there's still a chance outside…"</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Just then, the bone flute in his hand suddenly glowed with a faint light.</p><p>The change in the bone flute was without warning. Qin Sang had been waiting for this moment. Seeing it, his expression changed. He quickly suppressed his excitement, identified the direction the flute was pointing, and looked up towards a distant mountain.</p><p>The mountain was peaceful; not a single figure was visible.</p><p>The person with the other piece of the bone flute must be hidden there!</p><p>Qin Sang was about to get up and approach quietly when he suddenly saw a streak of green light shoot out from the mountain.</p><p>The green light was brilliant and incredibly fast, tearing through the air and racing towards the passage.</p><p>In the green light, there was the faint shadow of a pair of wings. The person controlling the light seemed to have transformed into a bird, flapping its wings, displaying a speed that even Qin Sang envied.</p><p>This person seemed to be pursued, fleeing in a panic. Instead of entering the wasteland, he headed straight for the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see his face, nor could he determine his identity.</p><p>He looked towards the direction the person came from; no one was pursuing him. That person was too fast; in the blink of an eye, he was inside the passage.</p><p>This caught Qin Sang off guard. His hiding place was somewhat remote, and the light on the bone flute was fading, and the connection was about to be severed.</p><p>Without thinking, Qin Sang hastily activated his talisman and sword energy thunder sound, unleashing his fastest speed to chase after him.</p><p>A terrifying force slammed into him.</p><p>As he approached the passage, Qin Sang almost got thrown out.</p><p>He used all his strength to activate his jade talisman, triggering his blood shield, barely managing to stabilize himself.</p><p>The familiar feeling returned.</p><p>Entering the immortal array, Qin Sang felt like a lone boat sailing into a stormy sea, buffeted by chaotic waves, making it hard to control his direction. Fortunately, the impacts were all coming from behind, pushing him towards the outside of the array.</p><p>The blood shield released by the jade talisman was on the verge of collapse, and cracks began to appear on the talisman itself.</p><p>Qin Sang had been through this before; he glanced at it and ignored it, focusing on the bone flute. The flute was like a dying candle, its light weak, but thankfully, it hadn't gone out.</p><p>Qin Sang exerted all his strength, struggling towards the direction indicated by the flute amidst the violent shocks.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang suddenly felt his body relax, followed by a piercing chill. He opened his eyes and found himself underwater.</p><p>The sea here was also turbulent, with the hurricane whipping up huge waves and strong currents.</p><p>The chaotic energy around him, though turbulent, was far weaker than the terrifying fluctuations within the wind barrier. Qin Sang knew he had successfully escaped the magical formation.  Using a water escape technique, he swam vigorously towards the surface.</p><p>He had entered through the wind barrier, but now found himself at the bottom of the sea.  Qin Sang was somewhat disoriented, unsure of the Seven Killing Hall's exact location.</p><p>Fortunately, his connection hadn't been severed, and it seemed the magical formation had drawn them closer. The bone flute glowed brightly, indicating the person was above.</p><p>To avoid attracting attention, Qin Sang put the bone flute away into his storage ring.</p><p>Emerging from the seawater, Qin Sang found himself outside the wind barrier's range, caught in a raging storm.  Everywhere he looked, there were towering waves; the distance was obscured. He could only rely on the bone flute's guidance to approach the other person.</p><p>In the storm, he had to constantly activate his protective treasure, greatly hindering his speed.</p><p>Battling the wind and waves, Qin Sang noticed the other person hadn't changed course, their goal clear—it wasn't East Gate Island.</p><p>"No wonder I haven't encountered him on East Gate Island. This person must have come from one of the other two islands. Judging by the direction, he's likely heading towards Gu Mountain Island…"</p><p>Qin Sang slowed down deliberately. He didn't want to contact the person yet, his mind racing. He planned to ascertain the person's identity upon reaching Gu Mountain Island.</p><p>The other person's speed was even faster than Qin Sang's, leaving him in awe.  The shadowy wings within the green light didn't seem like a magical artifact; if it was a manifestation of the person's abilities, their strength might even surpass Xiang Yi's—almost certainly a late-stage peak cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang sought the bone flute; a peaceful exchange would be ideal.</p><p>However, his cultivation was inferior.  A rash encounter could lead to misunderstandings, or the person, seeing Qin Sang's low cultivation, might develop murderous intent, inevitably leading to a fight.</p><p>Qin Sang's escape techniques surpassed others; he could come and go freely and wasn't afraid of strong opponents. But before this person, he was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Relying entirely on the fire pearl was unwise. If he failed to use it correctly, he'd be in a precarious position.  The uncertainty of the storm compounded this risk.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something amiss. He stopped abruptly, turning to the distance, and saw an unusually large wave surging towards him. The intense fluctuations made his heart pound. He vaguely saw two streaks of red and white light chasing each other in the air.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the lights, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. Yuan Ying stage cultivators were fighting nearby!</p>
