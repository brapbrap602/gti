<h1></h1><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The ominous flames of the Ice Serpent soared to the heavens.</p><p>A rain of frigid flames fell, a scene of extreme, dazzling brilliance.</p><p>The battle between Qin Sang and Yin Changsheng created a far greater disturbance than Tong Lingyu's. Apart from the Blood Pool of Slaughtering Yin, the stone cavern was now utterly unrecognizable.</p><p>The Ice Serpent repeatedly lashed its long tail, each strike like a blue lightning bolt, the astonishing destructive power threatening to shatter the Seven Calamities Slaughtering Formation with each blow.</p><p>Frigid flames danced in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were like fragile primitives struggling to survive a harsh, bitter winter, facing the world's most terrifying beast, dependent on each other for survival, on the verge of death at any moment, their corpses destined to become the beast's meal.</p><p>Liuli completely entrusted herself to Qin Sang, focusing all her spiritual sense on contending with Yin Changsheng for the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang held Liuli close, blood trickling from his seven orifices, looking incredibly wretched, retreating again and again.</p><p>The Seven Calamities Slaughtering Formation, worthy of being the only sword formation recorded in the *Nurturing the Nascent Soul with the Sword Chapter*, withstood the spiritual treasure, repeatedly nearing collapse, yet each time reborn from the ashes at the last moment.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had originally believed he could easily capture Qin Sang this time, but his hopes were dashed.</p><p>Qin Sang, clearly severely injured, was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Yet, every time he seemed about to lose, it was as if he employed some secret technique to stimulate his potential, suddenly surging with renewed strength, gaining a moment of divine valor, overcoming the crisis.</p><p>By now, how could Yin Changsheng not understand? He had been fooled!</p><p>However, Yin Changsheng could never have imagined that his divine sense attacks had not harmed Qin Sang in the slightest. He would only think that Qin Sang had a way to protect his nascent soul, and his injuries were not as severe as they appeared.</p><p>Yin Changsheng was furious.</p><p>The Ice Serpent's attacks became even more ferocious, reflecting its master's state of mind.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Yin Changsheng's prolonged, unsuccessful attacks had clearly made him more anxious than before. The influence of the demonic technique was deepening imperceptibly. Perhaps Tong Lingyu's scheme might actually succeed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still felt that this approach was improper.</p><p>It was equivalent to placing his hopes on his opponent.</p><p>If a variable arose, such as the opponent possessing an unexpected trump card, everything would be in vain.</p><p>He possessed the Sun Divine Tree.</p><p>Could the esteemed Palace Master of Profound Heaven Palace truly have only these methods?</p><p>Looking back on his path of cultivation, Qin Sang had never been one to sit and wait for death. He always actively fought for opportunities, which was why he had repeatedly turned danger into safety.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Yin Changsheng repeated his previous tactic.</p><p>The Ice Serpent opened its massive maw, its body once again merging with the frigid flames.</p><p>The frigid flames resembled a cold sun, emitting a ghostly glow. The cave had completely transformed into an ice cave. If a low-level cultivator entered, they would likely be frozen to death instantly.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The frigid flames shot out.</p><p>Like a meteor, it crashed down with extreme speed.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grim. Although he could resolve the crisis time and again, he was still only able to protect himself. He couldn't find any opportunity to counterattack, akin to walking on the edge of a cliff, his spiritual sense greatly consumed.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword trembled, emitting a clear sword cry, once again forming a sword formation, tirelessly guarding its master.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Brilliant flowing fire pierced the dim sword formation, its momentum surging, crushing and obliterating countless sword threads.</p><p>Unsurprisingly.</p><p>The sword formation was pierced once more.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this. He tightened his arm slightly, carrying Liuli several dozen zhang sideways. From the beginning of the battle until now, he had been circling the edge of the cave, his spiritual sense always locked onto the blood pool, gradually making new discoveries.</p><p>The energy connected to the Blood Pool of Slaughtering Yin seemed to be associated not with Yin Changsheng himself, but with the ice coffin!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang landed, but before he could steady himself, he suddenly sensed something unusual above, a premonition of danger rising in his heart.</p><p>Above their heads, cold mist swirled, and a white hand had appeared at some point.</p><p>The hand's five fingers were spread open, like an eagle's claw, swiftly grasping towards Liuli.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had predicted Qin Sang's landing position. The hand's speed was extremely fast, giving them no time to dodge.</p><p>It was somewhat similar to the secret technique that cultivator surnamed Yue had used during the Body Cleansing Pool trial.</p><p>However, this white hand was smaller than cultivator Yue's, but more solid. Its speed and power were far beyond what cultivator Yue could match.</p><p>"Another top-tier secret technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Profound Heaven Palace was hiding who knows how many secret techniques. Yin Changsheng, as the master of a sect, truly lived up to his position, with top-tier secret techniques emerging one after another, leaving him only to cope wearily.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The hand was as fast as lightning.</p><p>At the critical moment, a trace of determination flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a silver-white thread of lightning shot out from Qin Sang's dantian, striking the center of the hand after it had already begun its descent, but arriving first.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The hand froze, collapsing on impact, disappearing at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were unharmed.</p><p>The seemingly slender and weak thread of lightning had easily broken this divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang could no longer hide it. He had to expose another trump card, using the Heavenly Eye Divine Light to resolve the crisis. After the Heavenly Eye Butterfly advanced, the Heavenly Eye Divine Light had also improved slightly, seizing the timing more accurately. The previous moment had been the best opportunity.</p><p>In the midst of battle, such opportunities were rare, so it was not a waste.</p><p>However, for Qin Sang, it was not a good sign. Every trump card used was one less. Next time, Yin Changsheng would be on guard, making it difficult to achieve the same effect.</p><p>The secret technique was inexplicably broken.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had also not anticipated this situation, his expression stiffening.</p><p>His eyes stared straight at Qin Sang's dantian. The Heavenly Eye Divine Light had appeared too suddenly, and he hadn't clearly seen whether it was a magical treasure or something else.</p><p>For a moment, the cave experienced a brief pause.</p><p>"Huff! Huff!"</p><p>Qin Sang took Liuli to the other side, panting heavily, quickly stuffing several spirit pills into his mouth, a small consolation.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword silently flew back.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the ice coffin, inwardly wary. Yin Changsheng's sudden stop was unusual, and there must be a reason.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>"Very good!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's sinister voice came from the ice coffin.</p><p>Not only was it hoarse, but it carried a stronger sense of madness, and a clear, strange anger. He was already extremely weary and furious at Qin Sang's tireless resistance.</p><p>"I never thought that there would be someone in this world who could force me to use my Suspended Sword Pavilion!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's tone suddenly turned cold.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart. Tong Lingyu still did not understand her own Palace Master well enough!</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The cold mist inside the ice coffin suddenly churned violently. Yin Changsheng's figure was faintly visible, seemingly standing up from within the ice coffin.</p><p>At the same time, a white light slowly flew out from the ice coffin.</p><p>Within the white light was an extremely magnificent nine-story pavilion, Yin Changsheng's natal magical treasureâ€”the Suspended Sword Pavilion!</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion was crystal clear, as if carved from a piece of profound ice. Each and every decoration was exquisitely crafted. The nine stories were all hollow, without even walls, supported only by four pillars.</p><p>In the center of each story of the pavilion hung a sword.</p><p>The sword blades, like the Suspended Sword Pavilion itself, were carved from profound ice, similar in size and shape. However, each sword was engraved with different patterns and characters, ancient characters rarely recognized by people.</p><p>Nine stories, nine suspended swords.</p><p>Thus, the Suspended Sword Pavilion received its name.</p><p>The moment he saw the Suspended Sword Pavilion, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He truly felt the danger to his life.</p><p>Another spiritual treasure?</p>
