<h1>Chapter 1172: True Form</h1><p>A strange hissing sound filled the air, seemingly omnipresent.</p><p>The Qianji Demon King seemed to have vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was filled with a chaotic dance of snake-like shadows, constantly shifting and changing.  While he could clearly distinguish the real from the fake, effortlessly seeing through the illusions,  reacting calmly wasn't so easy.</p><p>A rush of air!</p><p>Countless snake shadows converged in an instant, swirling black mist into a massive tornado-like serpent.  Without pause, it twisted its body and lunged!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave. These weren't illusions; they were afterimages created by the Qianji Demon King's incredibly fast punches.  All the afterimages combined, their power seemingly amplified – a formidable battle technique!</p><p>The serpentine shadow was now countless times larger than before, rapidly closing in. Its speed seemed to break the sound barrier, creating a piercing shriek that echoed between the mountains, assaulting the eardrums and shaking the soul.</p><p>A fierce wind buffeted him.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang felt as if he were suffocating.</p><p>The Qianji Demon King was too fast, leaving Qin Sang with minimal reaction time.</p><p>He swiftly retreated, his surrounding spirit swords instantly shielding him.  A brilliant green light flickered from the tip of the Qing Meng sword, the only light in the black mist.</p><p>A hum!</p><p>Amidst the deafening echoes, the sword's song was almost inaudible.  However, both Qin Sang and the Qianji Demon King clearly saw the sword's light surge, forming a dazzling pillar of light that rivaled the Demon King's own power.</p><p>It even pierced through the black mist, reaching towards the heavens!</p><p>Before the Qianji Demon King could react, countless illusory sword lights erupted from the pillar.</p><p>The sword light divided.</p><p>The swords fell like rain.</p><p>Myriad sword lights, a dizzying spectacle, rained down upon the serpentine shadow.</p><p>Despite this overwhelming attack, the Qianji Demon King remained unyielding, resolutely pressing forward!</p><p>A whoosh!</p><p>The first sword light pierced the shadow and vanished instantly.  Upon closer inspection, one could faintly see a black shadow within the serpent twisting to engulf the sword light until both were annihilated.</p><p>This scene repeated itself; sword light after sword light was extinguished by the Qianji Demon King, rapidly shrinking the serpentine form. Yet, his advance was relentless, unhindered.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, shifting his sword technique.</p><p>His spirit sword trembled, the light pillar condensing into a giant sword that cleaved down at the shadow!</p><p>A resounding boom!</p><p>Another clash, devoid of flashy moves, but far more terrifying in its scale.</p><p>The earth trembled, rocks cascaded from the surrounding peaks.</p><p>The sword light and serpentine shadow clashed, locked in a fierce, mutually destructive struggle. The stalemate was broken when the Qianji Demon King snorted coldly, shifting several meters.</p><p>An instant later, a figure appeared where the Demon King had stood moments before.</p><p>Qin Sang had attempted a simultaneous attack, but missed his target.</p><p>Not surprised, he licked his lips, recalled his spirit sword, and launched a counterattack.</p><p>This was true man-sword unity.</p><p>Qin Sang unleashed his wings, transforming into a streak of lightning that flew alongside his sword, merging with the countless sword lights, elusive and unpredictable.</p><p>Bang, bang…</p><p>The Qianji Demon King reacted hastily, momentarily flustered, driven back by Qin Sang's relentless assault.</p><p>Though Qin Sang lacked the Demon King's mastery of close-quarters combat, his superior swordsmanship compensated for his deficiency, his every move precise and seamless.</p><p>The Qianji Demon King, presumably never having encountered such a fierce swordsman, seemed momentarily dazed. However, his experience as a renowned Demon King quickly surfaced, and he devised a counterstrategy.</p><p>The black mist swirled violently, surging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>A growing sense of sluggishness enveloped him, but Qin Sang remained calm, secretly activating three demonic banners from his sleeves, unleashing jets of demonic fire.</p><p>The flames weren't directed at the Qianji Demon King but at Qin Sang himself, rapidly spreading to form a fiery armor.</p><p>The black mist evaporated upon contact with the demonic flames, emitting a strange odor. While the flames couldn't completely dispel the mist, they provided sufficient protection, minimizing the effect on Qin Sang.</p><p>Witnessing this, the Qianji Demon King's expression changed. A cold gleam flashed in his eyes, his body twisted, transforming into a colossal demonic python dozens of meters long.</p><p>The python reared up, its cold gaze fixed on Qin Sang.  Its scales weren't purely black, but a grayish hue speckled with black spots – the infamous Black-Spotted King Snake!</p><p>“Demon form?” Qin Sang muttered, growing wary.  Demon beasts in their true forms were at their strongest.</p><p>Indeed, the Qianji Demon King, in his true form, immediately reversed the tide of the battle that had previously favored Qin Sang.  Despite its immense size, the python was incredibly agile. Its scales were incredibly tough; stray sword beams striking it only sparked, failing to pierce its defenses.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The python dodged an attack, then lashed out with its tail.  While Qin Sang evaded, the python blurred, splitting into three; two illusory images flanking him, trapping him.</p><p>Three giant pythons loomed above, their six icy gazes locked onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's face shifted.  Even without his butterfly spirit, he easily identified the illusions, yet they still emanated a palpable threat.</p><p>“What kind of power is this…?”  The thought crossed his mind just as the three pythons attacked.</p><p>“Seven Souls Killing Formation!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  He retracted his sword, pointed, and unleashed a series of incantations, imbuing it with radiant light.  Seven sword spirits materialized, followed by numerous slender beams of light, forming a sword array around Qin Sang’s head.</p><p>Qin Sang's sword array was vastly different from those he'd used before his ascension. These sword beams, a foot long, were incredibly dense, each a perfect replica of his spirit sword.  The spirit sword hummed, its light echoing the sound.  This was the Seven Souls Killing Formation; while Qin Sang hadn't yet mastered its true potential, its power far surpassed anything he'd wielded before.</p><p>As the formation formed, the three pythons lunged.  Before the actual attack landed, a terrifying force rippled through the air, distorting space.  Qin Sang felt like a real serpent was constricting him, three different forces tearing at him.</p><p>Qin Sang forcefully broke free, activating his sword seals.  A terrifying killing intent filled the air as countless sword images vanished, reappearing around him, encasing all three pythons within the sword array!</p><p>He wasn't concerned about revealing his human identity. The pure demonic energy within him, the genuine Azure Bird wings, and the demonic ancestor's image behind him – anyone seeing these would assume him to be a demon.  Even among truly transformed demon beasts, those who could understand their ancestor's image were exceptionally rare; they might even feel inferior to Qin Sang.</p><p>******</p>
