<h1>Chapter 1441: Sensing of the Sacred Object</h1><p>Qin Sang strode onto the light bridge.</p><p>The woman walked ahead with nimble steps, leading the way for him, a sweet smile gracing her face.</p><p>Her features were delicate and beautiful, her eyes lively and captivating.</p><p>Few would ever suspect that such a beauty was but a puppet.</p><p>"Senior Apprentice-Sister said that crafting puppets so lifelike isn't easy. I wonder how many the Myriad Demons Assembly prepared; quite a grand display," Qin Sang mused, listening to the puppet maid introduce the details of the Myriad Demons Assembly in a gentle voice.</p><p>The island was brightly lit.</p><p>Upon reaching the islet in the center of the lake, he was greeted by rows of exquisitely crafted bamboo houses, arranged in a circular formation.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that each bamboo house, though seemingly close, appeared to exist in its own independent space, without interfering with each other, and shielded against spiritual sense probing, likely due to some kind of spiritual array.</p><p>For the moment, neither Qin Sang nor the Skyeye Butterfly could discern the array's intricacies.</p><p>He once again marveled at the Myriad Demons Assembly's lavishness (or generosity).</p><p>Qin Sang followed the puppet maid into an unoccupied bamboo house and ascended to the second floor.</p><p>The second floor consisted of a single room, unblocked in front, but shrouded in darkness, rendering everything invisible.</p><p>The furnishings, however, were quite simple, consisting of only a few bamboo tables and chairs.</p><p>The puppet maid inquired if Qin Sang had any requests, assuring him that the Myriad Demons Assembly would fulfill any reasonable demand.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and instructed the maid to stand guard outside the door.</p><p>He tested it a bit, the Skyeye Butterfly should be able to see through a portion of the restrictions, but that might be noticed by the master of the spirit array, and it was not necessary to create unwanted complications.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on a bamboo chair and closed his eyes to gather his thoughts.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside an unknown room.</p><p>At this time, Elder Lan and Elder Mei of the Xuan Tian Palace were still waiting here, their expressions unusually solemn as they listened to a white-clothed man reporting something.</p><p>After a while, Elder Lan nodded gently, "You may leave first. Proceed according to the original plan, and remember to be discreet. I will notify you if there are any changes."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The white-clothed man withdrew from the room.</p><p>Elder Mei rubbed his forehead, and said in a low voice, "Great Saint Heavenly Peng will actually attend the Myriad Demons Assembly; the situation on Chaotic Demon Island is becoming increasingly complex!"</p><p>Elder Lan also felt quite troubled.</p><p>Upon receiving this news, his first thought was that trouble had arrived.</p><p>The Hidden Sun Realm bordered the Demon Realm, and conflicts were constant.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace and the demon race had fought countless battles, large and small. Great Saint Heavenly Peng had always been their greatest concern, yet they were helpless against him.</p><p>"It's not surprising. Didn't the Palace Master participate in the Myriad Demons Assembly back then? Alas, there's still no news from the Grand Elder; it seems he won't be returning. We must be extremely cautious."</p><p>Elder Lan sighed softly.</p><p>"Palace Master…"</p><p>Elder Mei's expression darkened slightly, just as he was about to speak.</p><p>At that moment, an octagonal Xuan Ice crystal, pure as crystal and pointed at both ends, hanging from Elder Lan's waist, lit up with a faint glow, emitting a strange fluctuation.</p><p>The fluctuation was very weak, but in the hearts of the two elders, it was like a thunderclap. They stood up abruptly, staring intently at the trembling octagonal Xuan Ice.</p><p>The octagonal Xuan Ice was precisely the Ice Key that Elder Lan had condensed earlier.</p><p>It could only exist for a few days, so it had to be re-condensed each time.</p><p>The octagonal Xuan Ice could sense the Sacred Object.</p><p>For the past few days, the octagonal Xuan Ice had shown no reaction, and they had all but given up hope.</p><p>"The Sacred Object!"</p><p>Elder Mei exclaimed in disbelief. He hadn't expected it to be found so easily.</p><p>"Did that fiend really die? Did the Sacred Object fall into someone else's hands? The sensing is very weak, indicating that the person used some kind of restriction to seal it. But he certainly wouldn't have thought that the seal is special, immune to external force."</p><p>Elder Lan also felt a sense of absurdity, as if it were unreal.</p><p>They had made so many arrangements, luring the traitor to show himself, never expecting that the Sacred Object would appear before them so easily.</p><p>Elder Lan sat down cross-legged, grasped the octagonal Xuan Ice with both hands, and activated a magical art.</p><p>The octagonal Xuan Ice glowed brightly.</p><p>The entire room, and the two people inside, were enveloped in a faint blue light. The light on the surface of the octagonal Xuan Ice fluctuated, accurately indicating the direction of the Sacred Object.</p><p>"That person is fast; they've already entered the islet in the center of the lake."</p><p>Elder Lan frowned.</p><p>They had an agreement with Old Devil Hunmo (Chaotic Devil Old Man) to not take action on or near Chaotic Demon Island, so as not to damage the reputation of the Myriad Demons Assembly.</p><p>With the trade fair about to begin, it was even more impossible to launch an attack and retrieve the Sacred Object at this time.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the special arrangements of the Myriad Demons Assembly, it was currently impossible to determine which individual was carrying the treasure.</p><p>Elder Lan held the octagonal Xuan Ice in his hand, pondered for a moment, and was about to transmit a message to notify the others and change the plan.</p><p>Just then, Elder Mei suddenly frowned, "Wait, could this be a conspiracy by that traitor?"</p><p>Great Saint Heavenly Peng had appeared.</p><p>Coupled with the previous rumors that lured the Grand Elder away, they couldn't help but overthink.</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Lan suppressed his joy, "Are you referring to Great Saint Heavenly Peng? Impossible! The Sacred Object can help the demon race refine their bloodline. That fiend would never dare to leak even a shred of information about it to Great Saint Heavenly Peng. Even if Great Saint Heavenly Peng couldn't open the seal himself, the old demon Great Saint Nine Heads (Nine Headed Great Saint) definitely has a way. If there really is a conspiracy, why would Great Saint Heavenly Peng appear so openly? Wouldn't it be better to set a trap outside?"</p><p>Elder Mei's expression changed as he pondered, "That fiend might have known long ago that Great Saint Heavenly Peng would attend the Myriad Demons Assembly, deliberately spreading rumors to lure away the Grand Elder, weakening our forces. Then, he colluded with some demons, luring us into action in order to plot something."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Elder Lan didn't know what to say.</p><p>That fiend, fleeing for his life, could still scheme to this extent; it was too incredible.</p><p>He actually leaned more towards the Sacred Object falling into someone else's hands. The other party didn't understand the Sacred Object's origins, which is why they dared to bring the Sacred Object to the Myriad Demons Assembly.</p><p>But Elder Mei's speculation wasn't impossible.</p><p>Where the Sacred Object was concerned, it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>"It's a pity that this is Old Devil Hunmo's lair; we can't take action on the island. The situation is complex; we can't get entangled or chase after the other party, lest we attract Old Devil Hunmo and Great Saint Heavenly Peng. You and I will act personally, striking swiftly and withdrawing quickly! I'll notify Elder Lu now, there is no need to sell Yin Li Pearls (Yinshade Pearls) at the trade fair. Have the juniors continue to act according to the plan, while the nascent souls secretly withdraw from Chaotic Demon Island, sealing off all directions. Hmm, with the Ice Key's sensing, we don't need to stay on the island anymore either."</p><p>Elder Lan raised his head, speaking rapidly as he formulated a plan to cope.</p><p>Elder Mei grunted in affirmation and said coldly, "That fiend had better be dead, otherwise, he'll taste the pain of the Bone Penetrating Needles! With such a large operation, manpower might not be enough. Send someone to notify Shi Xue and Liu Li, those two girls, they should also contribute to the sect."</p><p>Elder Lan hesitated for a moment, "Very well, the Sacred Object is about to be retrieved; there's no harm in telling them."</p><p>With that, the two elders exchanged glances, and with a flicker of their figures, they transformed into two transparent phantoms, silently passing through the wall.</p><p>Within the room, two figures remained, sitting at the table, their auras indistinguishable from living people, save for the slightly transparent nature of their skin.</p><p>They seemed to be quietly awaiting news from their subordinates.</p>
