<h1>Chapter 376: Kill</h1><p>As Qin Sang's voice rang out,</p><p>a fierce wind howled, and the earth was suddenly enveloped in endless yellow sand.</p><p>Kong Xin and the black-robed man's vision was completely obscured by the sand.  Their divine senses, upon probing outwards, encountered a strange resistance, causing both their expressions to change.</p><p>However, they quickly noticed that the sand only had the power to confuse, not to harm. As long as they maintained their focus, they could withstand it.</p><p>“Beware of their magical tools!”</p><p>Kong Xin shouted.</p><p>In the Earth Grotto, their original plan had been thwarted by Qin Sang's Ebony Sword, but they hadn't left empty-handed.</p><p>During the ghost onslaught, everyone's magical tools had been revealed, which allowed them to easily capture the Bao cultivator.</p><p>Typically, Foundation Establishment cultivators who possess two or three top-grade magical tools are already considered quite wealthy.</p><p>Kong Xin believed he had a good grasp of Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's capabilities.  Despite the ambush, it was only a two-on-two situation, so he wasn't overly alarmed.</p><p>Within the yellow sand, everything was uncertain.</p><p>The black-robed man was about to join Kong Xin when he suddenly felt a gust of wind from his left, triggering a strong sense of foreboding.</p><p>Recalling the magical tools Kong Xin had mentioned, the black-robed man's thoughts raced.  He swiftly drew a pale bone staff from his robes and struck in the direction of the wind.</p><p>The staff glowed brightly, then exploded with a loud crack, breaking apart section by section. It was crafted from the spine of a demon python.  The staff seemed to come alive, transforming into a white python.</p><p>The triangular python head opened its jaws wide, attempting to bite the incoming magical tool. However, this tool was neither the Black Dragon Stone nor the Binding Cord, but a cloud of black mist – the poisonous miasma of the Sky Venom Gauze!</p><p>The miasma was formless.</p><p>The white python plunged into the miasma, passing right through it.  Not only did it fail to stop the miasma, but the miasma's speed increased, instantly reaching the black-robed man.</p><p>The black-robed man was momentarily stunned, then felt his consciousness become hazy.  He realized his peril, but by the time he tried to retrieve another magical tool to defend against the miasma, it was too late.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a sword whistling through the air reached his ears. The black-robed man felt a sharp pain in his chest and was jolted awake, just in time to see a flash of sword light approaching like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Horrified, the black-robed man hurriedly reversed the bone staff.</p><p>Unfortunately, the staff had just been used and was depleted of power. Moreover, he had been slowed by the miasma, and this brief moment created an irreversible crisis.</p><p>Panic seized the black-robed man.  His eyes bulged, and in desperation, he spat a mouthful of vital essence onto the staff.</p><p>Invigorated by the essence, the staff's speed surged, narrowly deflecting the tip of the flying sword.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The black-robed man screamed, clutching his right chest as he stumbled backward.</p><p>Though wounded, he was secretly relieved.  The deflected sword hadn't pierced his heart, only his right chest.</p><p>With a healing elixir, the injury could be recovered.</p><p>But Qin Sang and Yun Youzi were a seamless team, giving him no time to recover.</p><p>Before the black-robed man could steady himself, he saw a shadow envelop him.  Looking up in terror, he saw a massive, mountain-like black shadow descend through the yellow sand, hurtling towards him.</p><p>The Black Dragon Stone fell from the sky!</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>The black-robed man cried out in terror, desperately trying to block the stone with the bone staff.</p><p>But the staff, having just blocked Yun Youzi's sword, was already drained.  It was powerless against the Black Dragon Stone.</p><p>The white python formed by the staff wailed, its long body trembling. A sickening cracking sound followed as the staff shattered. The unstoppable Black Dragon Stone slammed into the black-robed man.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The Black Dragon Stone weighed a ton.  Already wounded, the black-robed man's flesh was no match for this devastating blow. He, along with his protective robes, was crushed into a pulp, instantly killed.</p><p>At this time, Kong Xin had just summoned his magical tool for protection, contemplating how to join forces with the black-robed man against the two Daoists.</p><p>He and the black-robed man weren't close allies, merely temporary partners, wary of each other and maintaining a distance.</p><p>Kong Xin even harbored another intention.</p><p>Seeing the black-robed man ambushed, Kong Xin moved to rescue him but didn't exert his full strength, intending to let the black-robed man test the waters.</p><p>The black-robed man, notorious in the Unending Valley, possessed skills far surpassing cultivators of the same level. Even if he couldn't defeat the two Daoists, he could at least hold them off for a while.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Kong Xin planned to seize an opportunity, assassinate one of them, and turn the tables in an instant.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the black-robed man was so easily dispatched.  From ambush to death, it took less than three breaths.</p><p>Another possibility was that the two Daoists were far stronger than they imagined!</p><p>Fear gripped Kong Xin. Without hesitation, he turned to flee.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sound of metal clashing echoed.</p><p>Kong Xin gripped his blue light sword tightly, pointing it forward, his face grim.</p><p>A flying sword blocked his path.</p><p>It was Yun Youzi's sword. After gravely wounding the black-robed man, Yun Youzi shifted his target, preventing Kong Xin's escape.</p><p>The sword hovered in mid-air, aimed at Kong Xin. Behind it, Yun Youzi's figure slowly materialized.</p><p>Kong Xin said coldly, “I underestimated you two Daoists. How did you discover us?”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. “If you don't want anyone to know, don't do it.”</p><p>“No need for idle chatter, Daoist. The Winged Tiger has already noticed the commotion here. Kill him quickly and let's leave…” Qin Sang's voice drew closer, his last words spoken from close range.</p><p>Kong Xin's expression shifted, his eyes darting around vigilantly. He saw Qin Sang's figure appear nearby, releasing the Binding Cord, forming a pincer attack with Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi, without another word, launched his sword attack.</p><p>Kong Xin's eyes flickered. He raised his blue light sword to block Yun Youzi's, and just as the two swords were about to collide, he suddenly released the seal on his forehead. His power surged, and the blue light sword blazed, attempting to overwhelm Yun Youzi and break free.</p><p>“You were hiding your strength, I see.”</p><p>Yun Youzi laughed, unfazed.</p><p>A seasoned veteran, he wouldn't be fooled by such tricks.  With a flick of his wrist, his sword radiated power equal to the blue light sword, meeting it head-on.</p><p>Although Yun Youzi's cultivation was inferior to Kong Xin's, he wouldn't be defeated quickly.</p><p>Seeing his blue light sword entangled by Yun Youzi's and the Binding Cord closing in, despair washed over Kong Xin. A fierce expression appeared on his face.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>Kong Xin's meridians ruptured, blood spraying as he transformed into a bloody figure, his aura exploding. This was the final, desperate gambit of his cultivation technique.</p><p>However, before his secret technique could complete, the space behind his head distorted silently, and a transparent sword shadow materialized.</p><p>It pierced his skull.</p>
