Chapter 1322: A Decade of Learning

The fire spirit sensed the aura of spiritual flames and instinctively felt fear. The Nine Nether Demon Flame and the Ancestral Sacred Flame were both higher-tier existences compared to the Infernal Flame that had birthed it. Especially the Nine Nether Demon Flame, whose hierarchical suppression was most evident, causing the fire spirit to tremble in terror, too afraid to resist.

Seizing the opportunity, Binghan accelerated her pace. At the same time, she lightly tapped her mustard seed bag, and dozens of streams of light shot into the sky. Each stream of light contained a type of spiritual material. Crafting a spiritual treasure was not something a mere fire spirit could accomplish. The Void Spirit Sect had been planning this since the time of its founding ancestor, and generations of cultivators had expended untold effort to gather the necessary materials.

At this stage, Binghan had only one chance, and failure was not an option. Her expression remained calm as she guided the various spiritual materials into the square cauldron with her divine sense, refining them one by one, removing impurities, and retaining only the most essential parts to merge with the fire jade.

The Nine Nether Demon Flame and the Ancestral Sacred Flame, combined with the spirit formation, significantly suppressed the fire spirit. The fire jade began to change visibly. Originally a pure blue, it gradually took on a hint of crimson as it absorbed the various spiritual materials. Moreover, the shape of the fire jade also began to transform, elongating at both ends and gradually taking on the outline of a blade.

Everything was proceeding smoothly. Qin Sang and Xiang Qing relaxed their vigilance slightly, captivated by Binghan's artifact-crafting techniques as they observed carefully. Binghan's expression also grew more relaxed.

Just as the final runes were about to be inscribed, and the spiritual embryo was about to take shape, a sudden change occurred!

*Boom!*

The mountain within the mountain shook violently. The power of the underground fire veins surged with unprecedented ferocity, rushing toward them with overwhelming force. The fire spirit, sensing the approach of death, found its survival instincts overcoming its fear and made a desperate bid for freedom.

At the Void Spirit Sect, the mountain-protecting formation had already been activated by Binghan, and all disciples were ordered to remain within the sect, forbidden from leaving. The forbidden area was in turmoil, and the entire sect trembled as if the earth itself were turning over. The disciples of the Void Spirit Sect rushed out of their caves, their faces filled with alarm. Although the sect had experienced tremors before, none had been as violent as this one. The source seemed to be the forbidden area.

Yun Lan and several other Golden Core cultivators, who had been ordered to guard the foot of the mountain, saw the disciples gathering toward the forbidden area and shouted to stop them. They too wore expressions of concern, though they did not know the reason. They only knew that the sect master had invited two Nascent Soul experts, indicating that this matter was of great importance.

Back in the forbidden area, the three reacted swiftly. Upon noticing the fire spirit's sudden movement, Qin Sang and Xiang Qing did not hesitate, fully activating their spiritual flames to stabilize the jade cauldron and taking the brunt of the fire vein's impact in Binghan's stead.

*Boom!*

Qin Sang's face turned pale as fire poison invaded his body. But he paid it no mind, his gaze fixed on the jade cauldron. The fluctuations were too violent, and even Binghan was not spared, suffering the impact as well.

*Thud! Thud!*

The fire jade madly struck the jade cauldron. Qin Sang's expression darkened as he activated his corpse puppet bag with his divine sense. The seal on the Nascent Soul talisman puppet was released, and it flashed out, positioning itself behind Qin Sang to shield him from the impact.

The sudden appearance of another figure startled both Xiang Qing and Binghan. They soon realized it was a Nascent Soul-level puppet, and their astonishment deepened. Qin Sang, with his early Nascent Soul cultivation, had already made a significant impact on the battlefield. Who could have imagined that he also possessed a Nascent Soul talisman puppet, hidden from the world?

Xiang Qing was both shocked and relieved, casting a deep glance at Qin Sang, grateful that they had not become enemies. Qin Sang, unconcerned with their thoughts, released the Nascent Soul talisman puppet, easing the pressure on himself. He immediately employed a newly learned artifact-crafting secret technique to help Binghan stabilize the jade cauldron, working together to refine the fire jade.

He had exposed the Nascent Soul talisman puppet for a reason. The shaping of the spiritual embryo was the most critical step, and only by participating directly could he grasp its mysteries. Binghan would never have allowed them to intervene unless absolutely necessary, but now she had no grounds to refuse.

Sure enough, Binghan glanced at Qin Sang but said nothing, tacitly approving his actions. With their combined efforts, the fire spirit's final resistance was suppressed. The square cauldron gradually calmed, and the form of the fire jade stabilized, eventually taking the shape of a three-inch-long jade blade.

The spiritual embryo had been successfully crafted!

*Sigh...*

The three of them exhaled in unison. Qin Sang felt pain throughout his body, the fire poison having invaded his system. It would likely take some time to fully expel it, and the Nascent Soul talisman puppet had also suffered damage. But these costs were worth it!

Qin Sang's eyes sparkled as he thought of the gains he had just made. It was as if he had personally crafted a spiritual treasure embryo—an experience that could never be obtained from mere texts!

Xiang Qing looked somewhat drained, having just recovered from his injuries only to be wounded again. However, he did not rush to tend to himself, his attention drawn to the Nascent Soul talisman puppet behind Qin Sang. The talisman seals had been transformed into puppet seals, and no matter how hard Xiang Qing tried, he could not connect it to the Nascent Soul talisman puppets of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace.

"Fellow Daoist Qin, you've hidden yourself too well," Xiang Qing remarked sincerely.

In the fire spring, the jade blade floated quietly within the jade cauldron. Binghan reached out and gently caressed the blade. Gradually, the jade blade was engulfed by the infernal flames, forming a fiery cocoon. If this treasure were to be completed now, it would undoubtedly become another top-tier magical artifact, no weaker than Qing Jun's Five Directions Pagoda. But Binghan did not do so, allowing it to remain here until it developed its own spiritual nature.

The fiery cocoon, carrying the jade blade, sank into the fire spring.

"Thank you both for your unwavering assistance," Binghan said as she landed beside them, her beautiful eyes shifting. "Fellow Daoist Qin, I thought I had already held you in high regard, but you continue to surprise us."

"This puppet is still a bit rough around the edges. I had no choice but to release it in the heat of the moment, so please forgive its shortcomings. I have many enemies, so I hope you both can keep this a secret," Qin Sang said with a faint smile, storing the Nascent Soul talisman puppet away as he gazed at the jade blade. This jade blade might very well be the first spiritual treasure he had personally crafted. He wondered if he would have the chance to witness its power in the future.

The two tactfully refrained from asking further questions.

Binghan said, "You've both worked hard. I've prepared some medicinal pills for you. Go and suppress the fire poison in your bodies quickly, lest it leave lasting harm."

Qin Sang asked, "May I now peruse your sect's典籍?"

"Of course!" Binghan nodded, activating the spirit formation to seal the fire spring.

...

Time flowed like water.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang had spent a full decade at the Void Spirit Sect.

Many events had transpired over those ten years.

Two years ago, Jingyu successfully broke through to the mid-stage of transformation, followed by a perilous heavenly tribulation. In the end, Jingyu survived the tribulation without major incident.

Overjoyed, Qin Sang insisted on holding a grand celebration for Jingyu in the Thousand Bamboo Sea, inviting many fellow demonic cultivators. He also made an appearance at the ceremony.

Seeing Jingyu's attitude toward Qin Sang, the demon kings understood the deeper meaning behind this gesture.

The Snake King even took the initiative to share a cup of wine with Qin Sang.

As for Qin Sang himself, he voraciously studied the various典籍 and learned the secret techniques of the Void Spirit Sect. During this time, Li Yufu continuously supplied him with spiritual materials for practice, allowing his progress in the art of artifact crafting to advance by leaps and bounds. The magical artifacts he crafted were handed over to Li Yufu, either to reward disciples or to be sold.

Li Yufu and others frequently interacted with the disciples of the Void Spirit Sect, and they had all become quite familiar with one another.
