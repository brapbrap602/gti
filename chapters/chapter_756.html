<h1>Chapter 748: The Celestial Tower</h1><p>While Qin Sang and his companions were struggling against monstrous insects and beasts in the dense forest, a group of figures stood silently in the plaza before the Celestial Tower. Their auras were concealed, and their strange attire clearly distinguished them from humans. They were Nascent Soul ancestors of the Wu Clan.</p><p>At their head was a white-haired old woman.</p><p>The old woman wore the robes of the Grand Witch Priest, symbolizing the most esteemed status within the Wu Clan.  Half of her face was covered by a thin, cicada-wing-like, colorful mask, revealing only her chin and lips, which were surprisingly rosy.</p><p>She looked up at the Celestial Tower, lost in thought. After a moment, she suddenly turned towards empty space and said coldly, "The Demon Lord graces us with his presence. Why hide, and not show yourself?"</p><p>These words caused the other Nascent Soul cultivators to change color, and a commotion arose.</p><p>"Hehe, the Grand Witch Priest's perception is indeed keen. I have concealed my aura with all my might, yet I still couldn't escape your notice."</p><p>Laughter echoed from the void, followed by a sudden burst of strange light. With a 'swoosh', a middle-aged man appeared before everyone.</p><p>This man was the Demon Lord, the formidable leader of the demonic cultivators in the Canglang Sea!</p><p>After the dissipation of the Lunar Specter Divine Light, no demonic energy, hostility, or baleful aura could be sensed from him. His gaze was calm, his demeanor extraordinary, resembling a great Confucian scholar.</p><p>However, the appearance of this man caused the Wu Clan Nascent Soul cultivators to adopt expressions of vigilance.</p><p>The Demon Lord didn't seem to mind his discovery by the Grand Witch Priest, nor did he pay attention to the wary Wu Clan cultivators. He looked directly at the Grand Witch Priest.</p><p>Only the old woman's expression remained unchanged. She looked deeply at the Demon Lord and said indifferently, "You showed yourself once before, so naturally, I must be cautious. However, I've heard that the true treasure trove of the Seven Kill Hall can only be accessed when it reveals itself. Are there any treasures left outside that are worth your personal visit?"</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled and spread his hands. "Why do you ask what you already know? The Wu Clan has taken a no-holds-barred stance, forcing us humans to agree to share the Seven Kill Hall, and then went through great lengths to break the formation. How could we not be wary? Unfortunately, that old fox from the Heavenly Dao Sect claimed that his cultivation technique had gone awry, causing him internal injuries, and he needs to retreat for recuperation. So, I had to come myself. I'm also curious, what could be in this Seven Kill Hall, a place that has been thoroughly searched, that's worth all this effort?"</p><p>The old woman scoffed, "Whether Ling Zhuzi's injuries are real or fake, who can say? Even if you set a trap outside the Seven Kill Hall to ambush us, I wouldn't be surprised."</p><p>"Likewise..."</p><p>The Demon Lord laughed heartily. "Hasn't Fellow Daoist Fang also not appeared? I'm quite uneasy as well."</p><p>The old woman snorted coldly, "So, you're determined to follow me?"</p><p>The Demon Lord smiled without speaking.</p><p>"Since you insist on following, I won't stop you. Let's each rely on our own abilities."</p><p>The old woman withdrew her gaze, ignoring the Demon Lord, and addressed the others, "Fellow Daoists, your tasks have been assigned. I won't say more. Success or failure depends on this. Let's move!"</p><p>With that, the Wu Clan Nascent Soul cultivators departed in different directions. The speed of Nascent Soul ancestors was remarkable; in an instant, they scattered like blossoms in the wind, disappearing into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>The old woman entered the Celestial Tower alone.</p><p>The Demon Lord didn't expect the Wu Clan to disperse like this.</p><p>"Is the old witch trying to confuse me, or is she really looking for something?"</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, strange light surged in the Demon Lord's palm, splitting into several strands that also flew into the mountains. Then, he followed the old woman into the Celestial Tower.</p><p>After the brief commotion, silence returned to the area outside the Celestial Tower.</p><p>After a while, figures emerged from the nearby hills. They had witnessed the confrontation between the Demon Lord and the Grand Witch Priest. Fortunately, no one paid them any attention.</p><p>Some hesitated and chose to leave, while others gritted their teeth and rushed inside.</p><p>...</p><p>"Follow this river upstream."</p><p>In the jungle.</p><p>Thanks to the Merchant Alliance's thorough preparations, Qin Sang and his companions were still unharmed.</p><p>Xiang Yi led them to a riverbank.</p><p>This river was very strange. Its wide surface was covered with purple algae, and even the water was purple. This large river flowed through the dense forest, its origin unknown.</p><p>The purple river water flowed gently, and the algae obscured the view. The depths of the water were murky and nothing could be seen.</p><p>This river gave them a bad feeling, and they all tried to stay away from the bank. The monstrous insects and beasts in the dense forest had left a deep impression on them.</p><p>This strange-looking river was definitely a dangerous place!</p><p>"This is the legendary Purple River!"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Pan's face suddenly turned pale, which looked even stranger with the mask on his face.</p><p>"Following the Purple River upstream leads to the most dangerous area of this jungle, a place filled with purple poisonous mist. Itâ€™s called the Purple Mist Death Zone, a terrifying name that has claimed the lives of countless cultivators. Fellow Daoist Xiang, you're not taking us into the Purple Mist Death Zone, are you?"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Pan stared, questioning.</p><p>The others were also startled by these words and stopped, staring at Xiang Yi.</p><p>The Purple Mist Death Zone was one of the most dangerous areas in the Seven Kill Hall, also known as one of the three deadly poison zones. Previous explorers had warned later generations never to go to these places.</p><p>None of them expected the Merchant Alliance to send them to such a place.</p><p>With their cultivation levels, it was uncertain whether they could withstand the poisonous mist's erosion, let alone the ubiquitous dangers.</p><p>Going there would be suicide; completing the mission would be impossible.</p><p>Xiang Yi calmly nodded. "Since we're here, I won't keep it a secret any longer. The Merchant Alliance has ordered us to enter the Purple Mist Death Zone. For this, the Alliance Leader has granted me a poison-repelling treasure, personally refined by him. As long as we don't go too deep into the core of the Purple Mist Death Zone, with this treasure, we can easily resist the poisonous mist, so you don't need to worry."</p><p>The Liu couple frowned. "It seems that some predecessors who entered the Purple Mist Death Zone mentioned that the toxicity of the mist changes. However, Fellow Daoist Xiang, we have agreed beforehand that if, after entering the Purple Mist Death Zone, the treasure shows signs of being unable to withstand the poison, we must abandon the mission and retreat. We don't want to die inexplicably in there."</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p>They had known that the Merchant Alliance's mission wouldn't be simple, but they hadn't expected to be sent to such a dangerous place.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He wondered if the Fat Silkworm's poison-repelling carapace could withstand the poisonous mist.</p><p>He had only tested it on Nascent Soul stage demonic beasts before.</p><p>After the Fat Silkworm's transformation, the poison-repelling carapace could easily withstand the potent poison of a Greater Demon.</p><p>However, that was poison produced by demonic beasts, which was certainly different from a strange poison like the purple mist, born from heaven and earth.</p><p>Xiang Yi said dismissively, "The Merchant Alliance has gone to such great lengths and made so many preparations. Could it be to harm us? Rest assured, fellow Daoists, I know what I'm doing. If it's impossible, I won't force it."</p>
