<h1>Chapter 1771: Gray Tribulation Lightning</h1><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Thunder echoed in his ears.</p><p>Dark clouds churned, the sky dimmed.</p><p>Wind and thunder played in unison, the earth vast and desolate.</p><p>The pressure of the Heavenly Dao descended, and Qin Sang felt as if he were carrying a mountain on his back.</p><p>The nearby yao beasts had all been driven away by Qin Sang.  The remaining ordinary creatures instinctively sensed the mortal danger and fled frantically outwards.</p><p>Qin Sang’s Daoist robe rustled.  The Heaven's Eye Butterfly, perched on his shoulder at some point, now spread its wings and flew around, finally confirming that there was nothing nearby that could threaten Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully surveyed the area beforehand.</p><p>This was the location he had meticulously chosen for his tribulation, far from Crane Cry Mountain. It was located south of the Yellow Springs Path, almost at the edge of Mount Juzhi, and not far south from there was the Land of Calamity.</p><p>Because the Yellow Springs Path was situated in the southern part of Mount Juzhi, the southern region was far less expansive than the northern one. Once war broke out, it was easy to get caught in the crossfire, so most of the sects of Mount Juzhi were located in the north.</p><p>There were no sects nearby. Unless someone happened to pass by, true experts shouldn't come to such a remote place.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword transformed into a streak of sword light, circling his body.</p><p>However, swordsmanship would likely be of little use this time. His physical body was his true reliance.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the tribulation clouds.</p><p>His premonition was correct. This Fourth-Nine Heavenly Tribulation was extraordinary.  The tribulation lightning hadn't even formed yet, but the pressure was already far beyond expectations.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't been arrogant. If he hadn't broken through before the tribulation arrived, he would likely be in dire straits.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The tribulation clouds formed with astonishing speed.  Looking at them, a strange look appeared in Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>Tribulation lightning was born deep within the tribulation clouds.  Qin Sang could already see the lightning serpents coursing within.</p><p>But strangely, the lightning serpents were gray.</p><p>Gray Tribulation Lightning!</p><p>Qin Sang had seen the silver tribulation lightning of spirit insects, his own azure tribulation lightning, and Cloud Traveler’s azure-gold dual-colored tribulation lightning, but this was the first time he had seen gray tribulation lightning.</p><p>As far as he knew, cultivators in this world, like those in the Storm Realm, also experienced azure tribulation lightning, while yao cultivators faced golden tribulation lightning.</p><p>At least, in the ancient texts Qin Sang had collected, there were no records of gray tribulation lightning.</p><p>He didn't have time to think further.  The tribulation lightning had arrived!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Lightning cascaded like a waterfall.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen such a bizarre sight.  The sudden appearance of the thunder didn't illuminate the heavens and earth, but instead added a touch of darkness to the void, as if the light was being absorbed by the tribulation lightning.</p><p>The gray tribulation lightning didn't seem as overwhelmingly powerful as the previous tribulation lightnings, but its violent nature remained unchanged, and it was even more daunting.</p><p>Contemplating the Buddhas, forming the Heart Seal.</p><p>Golden light flowed throughout his body, his internal energy mobilized.  Without hesitation, Qin Sang executed the Auspicious Seal and the Vajra Celestial Armor Seal, while his right hand formed the Demon Subduing Seal.</p><p>A Physical Cultivator must possess the boldness to shatter everything. Qin Sang would not passively await his fate.  He stomped his foot heavily, leaped into the air, and actively confronted the tribulation lightning.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly was eager to try, but Qin Sang stopped it.</p><p>Uncertain about the nature of the gray tribulation lightning, Qin Sang didn't dare let the Heaven's Eye Butterfly devour it directly.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang soared skyward, his expression grave.  A strange, brilliant light seemed to emerge from his right palm, transforming into a golden hand seal.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>At the instant the thunder and the hand seal were about to collide, everything seemed to slow down.</p><p>This was an illusion brought about by the collision of two powerful forces.</p><p>The gray tribulation lightning engulfed Qin Sang, and then a figure was seen crashing heavily towards the ground.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The earth trembled, and a crater appeared.</p><p>Strangely, the tribulation lightning didn't press its advantage.  It froze in mid-air, then fractured inch by inch.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The lightning shattered!</p><p>The tribulation lightning was actually shattered by Qin Sang with a single blow!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang burst out from the crater, gray lightning arcing across his body.  Some seemed to penetrate the Celestial Armor, seeping into his body.</p><p>His hair was disheveled, but he seemed oblivious, laughing wildly, shouting with exhilaration, his laughter filled with immense confidence.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The second bolt of tribulation lightning followed.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang had fewer reservations.  He mentally commanded the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, then once again soared to meet the tribulation lightning, this time using the Rotating Altar Seal.</p><p>The Rotating Altar Seal wasn't as relentlessly forward-moving as the Demon Subduing Seal. Once this seal was executed, the space around the hand seal seemed to become viscous. When the tribulation lightning struck this area, it also stalled, its momentum slowing.</p><p>This seal wasn't just effective against magical treasures.  With Qin Sang’s cultivation level, he could also use this seal to neutralize Daoist spells and divine abilities used against him.</p><p>Of course, this seal couldn't completely restrain the tribulation lightning, only impede it for a moment.</p><p>That moment was precisely what Qin Sang needed. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly eagerly rushed forward, lightning flashing between its wings, then a lightning net shot out from its wings.</p><p>The lightning net closed, enveloping the tribulation lightning, then abruptly retracted, devoured by the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The next moment, a layer of gray mist seemed to cover the Heaven's Eye Butterfly’s Heaven's Eye.  Its wings closed tightly, and its slender body trembled.</p><p>Seeing that the Heaven's Eye Butterfly was unharmed, Qin Sang no longer paid attention to it, focusing on confronting the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Against the Heavenly Tribulation, tactics like dodging were useless, so Qin Sang barely used the Lotus Seal, instead rotating between the Demon Subduing Seal and the Rotating Altar Seal.</p><p>The thunderclouds churned, the tribulation lightning seemingly endless.</p><p>The power of each bolt was stronger than the last, and Qin Sang’s calm expression gradually faded.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>Outside the tribulation site, on the border of Mount Juzhi, four figures were speeding through the mountains, three men and one woman, all dressed in Daoist robes.</p><p>Their auras varied in strength.  The woman was the strongest, likely at the late Gold Core stage.</p><p>They continuously crossed peaks, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>After searching for a long time, the short, stout Daoist finally couldn't help but say, "Senior Sister, we've been searching for so long and haven't found that spiritual herb. I think the information might be wrong.  If we continue forward, we might run into the yao soldiers of the Ghost Fang Kingdom. If that happens…"</p><p>The woman ignored him.</p><p>The man in front of the stout Daoist turned back and said, "The information came from the Dao Court, it shouldn't be wrong.  That spiritual herb is very important to Senior Sister, we must find it. Junior Brother, don't worry.  This place is still some distance from the border between the two forces, and it’s so remote.  Even if there are yao or demons, they won't be too powerful."</p><p>The stout man nodded. He also understood reason, but he was getting frustrated after searching for so long without any results.</p><p>Just then, the woman suddenly stopped.</p><p>"Senior Sister, what's wrong?"</p><p>Her companions were startled, looking vigilantly around.</p><p>The stout Daoist was apprehensive, worried that his Senior Sister would scold him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the woman suddenly activated her escaping light and flew towards the distance.  The others quickly followed.</p><p>After flying for a while, the four stopped on a mountaintop, staring blankly ahead.</p><p>"A Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>The woman said solemnly.</p><p>At this moment, they were still very far from the tribulation site, but they didn't dare to go any further.</p><p>Standing there, they could see a patch of blackness in the sky, where dark clouds had obscured it.</p><p>Although far from the tribulation clouds, they could still feel the aura of the Heavenly Tribulation, their souls trembling.</p><p>"It seems... stronger than Master’s Heavenly Tribulation."</p><p>A Daoist in a tall hat said, his voice trembling.</p><p>The woman remained silent, staring at the tribulation clouds, a hint of doubt in her eyes.  She had witnessed her sect's elders undergo tribulations, and at that time, the lightning was dazzling, illuminating the heavens, the heavenly might awe-inspiring.</p><p>But this mass of tribulation clouds was too strange.  Only dark clouds churned, with no visible lightning serpents or bolts, only a sense of gloom.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The woman was confused, wondering if her spiritual sense was mistaken. How could such a Heavenly Tribulation exist in the world?</p><p>Reminded by the woman, the others also reacted, all very puzzled.</p><p>"Senior Sister, should we go closer and take a careful…"</p><p>The Daoist in the tall hat didn't finish speaking before being sharply interrupted by the woman.</p><p>"Absolutely not!"</p><p>The others quickly swallowed their words, understanding that their Senior Sister was right.</p><p>Regardless of the type of tribulation lightning, the other party's cultivation level was definitely far beyond theirs, and undergoing tribulation in the wilderness likely meant they had someone protecting them.</p><p>If they were discovered, they would all die!</p><p>However, this was the first time they had encountered such a strange Heavenly Tribulation.  There were no records of it in the ancient texts. They were too curious, and it was somewhat unsatisfying to leave like this.</p><p>The stout Daoist’s eyes suddenly lit up, "Senior Sister, didn't you bring a Fleeting Glimpse Talisman?"</p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked expectantly at the woman.</p><p>The woman hesitated.  This talisman could transform into a water mirror, silently observing the enemy's movements from afar. It was something she had requested from her elders, specifically for this herb-seeking trip.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, the woman decided to use the talisman.</p><p>She flipped her wrist, and a shimmering blue talisman appeared in her palm, followed by the sound of popping bubbles.</p><p>A palm-sized water mirror appeared before the four.</p><p>The water mirror reflected the void at the edge of the tribulation clouds.</p><p>If it were aimed at the center of the tribulation clouds, it might reveal the person undergoing the tribulation.  However, given the other party’s high cultivation, their spiritual sense must be extremely acute. If they were detected, it could attract pursuit, and that would be disastrous.</p><p>Coincidentally, the tribulation clouds brewed another wave of tribulation lightning.</p><p>Gray tribulation lightning flashed within the mirror.</p><p>The four stared blankly at the water mirror.</p><p>The mirror only reflected an image, but they felt as if the tribulation lightning was about to break through the mirror and strike them. They couldn't help but freeze.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The water mirror seemed unable to withstand the aura of the tribulation lightning and cracked.</p><p>The woman's expression drastically changed, and she cried out in alarm.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>The four fled in panic.</p><p>Even after they could no longer see the tribulation clouds, they remained in a daze.</p><p>"Gray tribulation lightning, such tribulation lightning actually exists in the world. It's a pity we didn't see the person undergoing the tribulation…" the Daoist in the tall hat muttered.</p><p>"The world is vast, and wonders abound."</p><p>The woman quickly regained her composure.  "This place is not suitable for a long stay. We can't continue searching for the herb here."</p><p>"Right! Right!"</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>…</p><p>At the center of the tribulation clouds, Qin Sang was once again struck down by tribulation lightning.</p><p>Even if those people had seen him, they wouldn't have recognized his true appearance, because Qin Sang had already activated the  《Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele》, transforming into a spirit wood body.</p><p>Those unaware of this would think that an ancient tree spirit was being struck by lightning.</p><p>The surrounding scenery was utterly destroyed, the earth riddled with craters.</p><p>Gray lightning tore through the tribulation clouds. The more powerful the tribulation lightning became, the darker it grew.  Black, oppressive clouds blotted out the sun, trapping Qin Sang in this small area.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Countless lightning bolts wove into a net, raining down like serpents, all aimed at a single target.</p><p>The tall figure of the tree man now seemed small.</p><p>Its rough face showed little expression, only its eyes shone brightly, devoid of fear.</p><p>The wounds on Qin Sang’s body were rapidly healing, partly due to the spirit wood body continuously absorbing the surrounding wood spirit energy, and partly due to the body's own powerful regenerative ability, making him seemingly inexhaustible.</p><p>He leaped high once more.</p><p>Using the spirit wood body to execute the 《Seven Buddhas Seals》 enhanced its power even further.</p><p>The Rotating Altar Seal impeded the tribulation lightning, then the Demon Subduing Seal was unleashed.  Qin Sang’s palm was like a blade, actually splitting the tribulation lightning in half with a single palm strike. Part of the lightning was immediately repelled and swallowed by the waiting Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The remaining tribulation lightning either dissipated or struck Qin Sang heavily.</p><p>Another crater appeared on the earth, but Qin Sang quickly climbed out again.</p><p>Within the tribulation clouds, the next wave of tribulation lightning was brewing.</p><p>Though Qin Sang appeared vigorous, his expression was rather grave.  He ordered the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to retreat.</p><p>He would likely be unable to protect the Heaven's Eye Butterfly next, and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, having devoured so much tribulation lightning, was nearing its limit.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>Struck down again and again, rising again and again.</p><p>Qin Sang fought tirelessly against the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>The surrounding forests began to wither in large swathes as the wood spirit energy was absorbed by Qin Sang.  These plants also faced their own calamity.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Finally, the tribulation clouds dispersed.</p><p>The earth was deeply sunken. The final bolt of tribulation lightning had split the ground, creating a canyon out of thin air.</p><p>When the tribulation clouds dissipated, a rough hand suddenly reached out from the canyon, gripped the edge, and leaped out.</p><p>…</p><p>Somewhere in a courtyard.</p><p>There were no exotic flowers or plants, no rockeries or lotus ponds in the courtyard.  The scenery seemed rather monotonous.</p><p>Inside the only wooden building, a dark-skinned, strange man was meditating, surrounded by silence.</p><p>Suddenly, the restrictive formation outside the courtyard was triggered.</p><p>The dark-skinned man awoke and heard someone outside say, "Reporting to Immortal Mo, the Lord requests your presence."</p><p>He got up and walked out of the courtyard. Seeing that it was an immortal official from the Heavenly Hub Institute, he nodded slightly and followed the official, soon arriving at a magnificent hall.</p><p>The hall doors were open.</p><p>The immortal official bowed and retreated. The dark-skinned man entered the hall and saw the Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor staring intently at something in his hand.</p><p>"Did I interrupt Immortal Mo's cultivation?"</p><p>The Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor looked up with a smile. "Come and take a look at this."</p><p>The dark-skinned man stepped forward and saw that he was holding a palm-sized jade slip.</p><p>A very brief image repeatedly appeared within the jade slip.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>The dark-skinned man's gaze sharpened.</p><p>"I see it, gray tribulation lightning!  Our efforts have paid off, we finally found it."</p><p>The Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor handed the jade slip to the dark-skinned man. "This image was discovered and recorded by a disciple of a sect in Mount Juzhi.  Unfortunately, their cultivation level was too low, and they didn't dare to pry on the person undergoing the tribulation.  However, this image is enough to corroborate the contents of the ancient texts. This is the Heavenly Tribulation that ascended cultivators face!  Your companion…"</p><p>As he spoke, the Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor clasped his hands behind his back and looked out of the hall. "Since she underwent the tribulation in Mount Juzhi, and closer to our side, she probably hasn't joined the Ghost Fang Kingdom yet.  However, according to the ancient texts, although the gray tribulation lightning has immense benefits for cultivators from Lesser Thousand Worlds, its power also far surpasses ordinary tribulation lightning.  If she managed to safely overcome this tribulation, and hasn't joined the Ghost Fang Kingdom, she might have already been taken in by some fellow Daoist."</p><p>The dark-skinned man stared at the jade slip for a long time. "If the ancient texts are true, and cultivators from Lesser Thousand Worlds only face this type of tribulation upon entering a Greater Thousand World, doesn't that mean this place can only be a Greater Thousand World! You... why do you say 'perhaps'?"</p><p>The Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor gazed at the sky and said calmly, "Because the Dao Court has no definitive answer! Perhaps, one day, when you and I have the ability to delve deep into the Sea of Calamity and the Land of Calamity, and reach the other shore, we will know."</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
