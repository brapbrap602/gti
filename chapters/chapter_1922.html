<h1>Chapter 1913: The Locust Plague</h1><p>A large carp, weighing perhaps seven or eight pounds, was hauled onto the boat.</p><p>The fish spear was deeply embedded in its belly.</p><p>This spear was made by splitting one end of a bamboo pole into three, separating them with small sticks, binding them with hemp rope, and sharpening the three points.</p><p>One of the points had pierced right through the fish’s belly, and blood flowed freely.</p><p>The little boy’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>Even the old man, who had pulled the carp up himself, was astonished.  He had made this spear casually to amuse the child; he hadn't expected it to be so effective.</p><p>That girl…</p><p>Everyone on the boat looked at Xiao Wu with curious glances.</p><p>Qin Sang finished her drink, smiling.  “Xiao Wu is naturally strong. Let this carp cover the boat fare…”</p><p>Just then, the river ahead curved again, continuing its southward course.</p><p>As they rounded the bend, they saw a wharf ahead.</p><p>Seeing the scene at the wharf, the old man let out a soft exclamation.  Forgetting about Xiao Wu, he instructed his grandson to take care of the carp and hurried to the bow of the boat to look.</p><p>Along their journey, they had passed several wharves scattered along both banks of the river; the two boats proceeded independently.</p><p>Ahead, they encountered another wharf on each side of the river, but the scenes on either bank were vastly different.</p><p>A few travelers stood sparsely on the east bank, but the west bank wharf was crowded with people.</p><p>Heads bobbed, all carrying bundles of various sizes.</p><p>However, most of these people were adult men and women, the pillars of their families; there were no children or elderly people, and they didn’t seem to be fleeing.</p><p>The boat ahead had docked, its stern filled with passengers, causing it to sit low in the water.</p><p>Seeing it was overcrowded, the passengers on the wharf still tried to squeeze onto the boat. Someone almost fell into the water, prompting angry shouts from the boatman.</p><p>Seeing the approaching boat, the boatman’s eyes lit up. “Uncle Chen, my boat’s full. Take these people aboard.”</p><p>Without further ado, he untied the rope and pushed the oar against the bank, significantly slowing the boat’s speed.</p><p>The old man quickly turned the bow of his boat, first picking up his passengers from the east bank, then heading towards the west bank.</p><p>As soon as the boat approached, people eagerly tried to jump aboard.</p><p>The people on the shore were packed together, fearing they wouldn't make it onto the boat, desperately pushing towards the wharf.</p><p>The wooden wharf creaked ominously, raising concerns about its stability.</p><p>“Easy! Easy! There’s room! There’s room!”</p><p>The old man hurried to call out, stabilizing the boat and standing at the bow, letting people board one by one.</p><p>The first to board was a farmer, whom the old man grabbed.</p><p>“Lao Yue, why are all of you from West Five Village here? What happened?”</p><p>The farmer sighed deeply. “We’ve got a plague!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The old man was startled, causing a commotion in the cabin as the other passengers poked their heads out, asking anxiously.</p><p>“A plague?”</p><p>“What kind of plague? What plague?”</p><p>…</p><p>These were villagers who worked the land, making them acutely sensitive to the word “plague.”</p><p>In years of famine, life was unbearable. Those who had experienced it didn't dare recall it.</p><p>Fortunately, the northern area had fairly good fortune; they rarely experienced a major disaster for eight or ten years, and could usually manage.</p><p>This year wasn’t exactly prosperous, but it was far from a famine year.</p><p>Moreover, other villages hadn't noticed anything unusual; only these five villages were affected.</p><p>“Locust plague!”</p><p>“A locust plague!”</p><p>…</p><p>The people on the wharf spoke in excited tones.</p><p>“What! A locust plague!”</p><p>“A swarm coming from the west?”</p><p>Everyone was alarmed, some rushing out of the cabin in panic, "Is there really a swarm?"</p><p>The northern county was situated near mountains and water; it hadn't experienced a locust plague in at least a hundred years.</p><p>But the people had heard how terrifying a locust plague could be, even worse than floods and droughts. And it was happening at a time when harvests were still some time away.</p><p>If a swarm passed, the crops would be lost, and how would they get through the year?</p><p>“Haven’t seen the swarm yet,” Lao Yue shook his head, “Our village elder keeps a hawk, you know. That hawk is very intelligent, it can send messages from far away. A couple of days ago, there was a message from the west; a hunter going deep into the mountains had seen several mountains nearly stripped bare, a massive dark swarm flying east, possibly heading towards our county.”</p><p>“When a locust swarm passes, even the mountains are barren. What chance do people have? We should get to town, find some work and earn something to eat through the winter…”</p><p>Once the locust plague hit, countless disaster victims would flood into the city; no wonder they were so urgent.</p><p>Hearing this, the passengers panicked, some shouting that they wanted to get off the boat and go home to warn others.</p><p>The farmer enviously said to the old man, “Old Chen, you’re lucky.  Everyone's heading to the city; a few days’ work there will last a whole year.”</p><p>The crops in the fields were all gone.  "Where can we buy grain?"</p><p>The old man sighed, shaking his head. He called the boy over, muttering, "Son, once we're in town, go to the shops and buy several bags of rice. Grandpa will have to make a couple extra trips today…"</p><p>People boarded the boat at the dock, filling the cabin.  The bow and stern were also packed.</p><p>There wasn't room for many more; the rest would have to be left behind.</p><p>Among the crowd, the green horse stood out, remarkably tall and imposing.</p><p>"Boatman…"</p><p>Qin Sang, with young Wu, appeared at the stern.  "Please bring the stern to the shore. I've had my fill, and the horse is rested.  Let's make room for our fellow villagers."</p><p>"Oh dear! What a mess…"</p><p>The old man, having drunk the medicinal wine, now saw Qin Sang as a divine figure and was reluctant to let him leave the boat.</p><p>Conveniently, moving the green horse would free up a lot of space.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's insistence, the boatman turned the vessel, bringing the stern to shore.</p><p>"Son, quickly, the remaining cured meat…"</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>The boy, quick-witted, understood before his grandfather finished. He grabbed the package of cured meat and ran to the stern, unceremoniously shoving it into Qin Sang's arms.</p><p>"Thank you, boatman and young master, for your kindness."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't refuse, placing it on the horse's back. He helped Wu up, bowed slightly, and prepared to jump ashore.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The boy suddenly shouted.  He rummaged in a treasure chest, then ran back to the green horse, holding something aloft.  He said crisply, "Little Wu, this is for you!"</p><p>It was a rattle drum, its face covered in colorful embroidered velvet depicting a tiger's head.  The sound of small balls hitting the drum was a rhythmic *dong dong*.  It was the most exquisite item in the treasure chest, his favorite toy.</p><p>Wu lowered his head, not reaching for it.</p><p>"For you!"</p><p>The green horse was tall, but the boy, emboldened, approached, tiptoed, and forced the rattle drum into Wu's hand.</p><p>Wu looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Remember what to say?" Qin Sang prompted softly, without interfering.</p><p>Wu hesitated, then softly said, "Thank you."</p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p>The boy grinned, the sweat on his face glistening in the sun.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The green horse leaped, clearing the river in a single bound to land steadily on the bank, to the gasps of the onlookers.</p><p>The boy waved vigorously from the stern, clearly reluctant to part.</p><p>Suddenly, Wu tugged on the reins, turning the horse. "You… what's your name?"</p><p>"Me?"</p><p>The boy scratched his head, suddenly filled with regret for not asking his grandfather to have a scholar give him a name.  His eyes lit up.  He shouted, "Ya'er! Grandpa calls me Ya'er!  Grandpa's surname is Chen, so my name is Chen Ya'er!"</p><p>…</p><p>'Dong…'</p><p>'Dong dong dong…'</p><p>The rich sound of the drum echoed through the woods.</p><p>Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling the path.  The occasional birdcall blended with the drumming, adding to the tranquility.</p><p>Disembarking, Qin Sang didn't go south, but followed the path along the shore towards Xi Wu Village, as the people had described it.</p><p>Wu sat on the horse's back, gently shaking the rattle drum, not with much enthusiasm, more like an unconscious gesture.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Zhu Que, whom Qin Sang had been holding back, unable to get a single fish, plunged into the package and snatched a piece of cured meat.</p><p>"Ptoo! Ptoo! Ptoo!"</p><p>The salty, fishy taste was overwhelming. Zhu Que spat it out frantically.  "Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! It's awful!"</p><p>Had that fish soup really been made with this?</p><p>"Ha ha ha ha…"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Que's distress, Qin Sang burst out laughing.</p><p>Luo Hou raised a foreleg, neighing.</p><p>Wu didn't laugh, but shook the rattle drum more energetically.</p><p>Zhu Que was furious and squawked at them.</p><p>"Here you go."</p><p>After laughing, Qin Sang produced a bowl of fish soup with meat – he'd kept some aside.</p><p>Zhu Que eyed Qin Sang suspiciously, sniffing and investigating before finally happily devouring it.</p><p>The path wound on.</p><p>Over a ridge, vast fields came into view, a village nestled at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The path cut through the village, continuing west. The terrain remained relatively flat, with fields and villages still visible in the distance.</p><p>Willow trees lined both sides of the path, providing ample shade, far more lush than other trees.</p><p>The village below was deserted, no smoke rising, as if everyone had left.</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions continued their journey, passing through a fourth village and over a mountain pass, before encountering a sudden bustling scene.  The villagers from five villages were gathered together, crowding the roadside.  A procession approached; some carried a long table laden with offerings, while others, a mix of women, children, and the elderly, dressed festively and played music.  An outsider might have mistaken it for a temple fair or a celebration, but the villagers' faces bore no joy, only worry.</p><p>Qin Sang approached calmly, attracting attention; whispers rippled through the crowd. The procession carrying the table headed towards a mountain path to the west, led by an elderly man with strong posture but a weary spirit, his cloudy eyes filled with deep concern. He held a long staff, guiding the group. The bearers of the table, also elderly, frequently paused due to fatigue; the old man would signal for rests.</p><p>Only then did the old man notice the strangers. Upon seeing Qin Sang, dressed as a Taoist, his eyes brightened.  He whispered a few words, set down his staff, and quickly approached.</p><p>"Master…" he bowed respectfully before Qin Sang.</p><p>"My Daoist name is Qingfeng. Are you performing a ritual to appease the gods, old sir?" Qin Sang asked, looking at the table laden with offerings and incense.</p><p>"Gods… yes! Yes! Yes!  A ritual!  We're appeasing the gods!"</p><p>The old man nodded repeatedly, his face full of hope. "Master, you are a man of virtue, surely you understand the ways of spirits and gods?"</p><p>"Somewhat." Qin Sang nodded slightly.  "However, I cannot discern which deity you are appeasing. I hear a locust plague is approaching; are you praying for divine protection?"</p><p>"Well…"</p><p>The old man glanced at those behind him, pulled Qin Sang aside, and knelt. "Master, please guide me!"</p><p>Qin Sang prevented him from kneeling.  "Old sir, there's no need for such formality. I came upon hearing of this. If I can help, I will; if not, there's nothing more I can do."</p><p>"To be frank, Master, I had a dream a few days ago…"</p><p>The old man, who had apparently kept this to himself for days, finally found a Taoist priest; grasping at a lifeline, he poured out his story.</p><p>The old man was Yue Kaishan, the village headman of the first village. A few days earlier, he dreamt of a scholar in green robes and a scholar's hat. The scholar warned him of an impending locust god bringing a devastating plague, urging him to prepare.  Yue Kaishan awoke in shock, only to have the same dream the next night, realizing something was amiss. He released a hawk, which flew west, only to return after crossing several mountains, circling endlessly and crying shrilly, refusing to proceed west.  That night, he had the same dream again and could no longer ignore it.  He preferred to believe it, rather than dismiss it. But how could he convince his people?  His pleas to the village's earth god yielded nothing.  Eventually, Yue Kaishan forged a letter and, following the scholar's instructions, set up an altar on the western mountain, appeasing the locust god, begging for it to spare them, unsure if it would work.  During this time, Yue Kaishan bore the burden alone, neglecting his food and rest, his body near breaking point.</p><p>"The locust god…"</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated this, gazing at a nearby willow tree. "It seems there was a divine warning in your dream. Old sir, continue as the scholar instructed; it should be alright. Rest assured, I will not leave until the ritual concludes."</p><p>Yue Kaishan felt relieved, returning to lead the ceremony.  The ritual lasted three days, the altar remaining at the mountain pass, with fresh offerings each dawn.</p><p>On the fourth dawn,</p><p>A woman on a donkey appeared on the mountain path, exactly as the scholar described.  Yue Kaishan and everyone knelt as instructed. "Life is not easy, we beg the locust god for mercy!"</p><p>The woman stopped before the altar.  "That accursed willow interfered with my path! The crops may be spared, but you dared to appear for them, so suffer the consequences."  Turning her donkey, she went deeper into the mountains.</p><p>Shortly after, dark clouds gathered in the west. A massive locust swarm filled the sky, their buzzing deafening. The villagers were terrified.</p><p>The swarm flew overhead, but instead of descending on the fields, it descended on the willows, before flying into the wilderness. Where the locusts passed, the willow leaves were devoured, leaving the once vibrant trees withered and lifeless.</p><p>"Gone!"</p><p>"The swarm is gone!"</p><p>"They didn't eat the crops! They really didn't!"</p><p>The villagers rejoiced, their relief palpable.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from the mountain path, having done nothing. The locust god did not notice him. He glanced at the ravaged willows and flicked a few drops of a jade liquid, transforming into a fine mist over the trees.</p><p>"Master, why didn't you kill her?" Xiao Wu asked innocently, tilting his head.</p><p>(End)</p>
