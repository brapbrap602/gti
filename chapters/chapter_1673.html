<h1>Chapter 1664: Imperial Grant</h1><p>The connection broke!</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been observing the Fire Jade Centipede, tumbled out of the fissure, escaping the Five Elements Divine Restriction. The centipede’s agitation ceased, but Kun Dao had disappeared.</p><p>Unlike the dimness of the Nine-Origin Earth Magnetism, the outside world was bright and sunny. Qin Sang found himself standing on a rock, the sound of rushing water filling his ears.</p><p>He collected his thoughts and looked back, seeing a stone wall and a waterfall. The water flowed in a thin stream, not noisy, but rather refreshing and elegant.</p><p>The water fell into a pool, not large, yet the water level remained even with the bank.</p><p>No matter how much water poured in, it never overflowed.</p><p>This was clearly some kind of restriction, but not a destructive one. The surroundings seemed peaceful, which is why Qin Sang chose to exit from this spot.</p><p>The scenery was beautiful, but deserted.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly and stepped forward, looking down.</p><p>He had undoubtedly passed through the Five Elements Divine Restriction and entered the interior of Imperial Grant Mountain.</p><p>The view from above and below was the same: layers upon layers of colorful clouds formed a vibrant wall encircling the entire mountain.</p><p>But there were differences.</p><p>From below, the Celestial Ladder on Imperial Grant Mountain seemed directly exposed. Now, Qin Sang had a strange feeling, as if an invisible force isolated the mountain from the outside world.</p><p>If this force truly existed, it could be inferred that the entire mountain was enveloped by it, its edges merging with the clouds and the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Because of this feeling, Qin Sang wasn't sure if the clear blue sky he saw was real or an illusion.</p><p>It was like being trapped in a barrier, with the Five Elements Divine Restriction as the entrance.</p><p>This was just Qin Sang's guess; otherwise, there was no difference between inside and outside the clouds.</p><p>“That woman is probably hiding somewhere, licking her wounds…”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>Kun Dao’s injuries from the heavenly thunder and the Death Seal were real, especially the insidious Death Seal from Su Zinan, which seemed difficult to heal.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Kun Dao's entanglement, only that she would be scared off, leaving the Crimson Red Immortal Pendant lost again.</p><p>She had the advantage of the terrain, but neither Qin Sang nor Su Zinan feared her.  They could see that Kun Dao's control over the Five Elements Divine Restriction was limited, and her own strength wasn't particularly formidable.</p><p>In a chaotic situation, if she lurked in the shadows like a viper, she would be dangerous and needed to be watched.</p><p>In a direct confrontation, Qin Sang didn't think he would lose.</p><p>He turned and looked up. From this position, he could vaguely see a bright light moving on the south slope of Imperial Grant Mountain—the Celestial Ladder he had seen before.</p><p>According to Zhu Wudao, the Celestial Ladder was the only way to reach the Uninscribed Jade Tablet; there was no point in trying to find another path. Imperial Grant Mountain was the core of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, heavily protected by formations; even powerful cultivators had to be cautious here.</p><p>He could vaguely see the outlines of palaces in the mountains and forests.</p><p>Each one was shrouded in mist and heavily guarded.</p><p>“Can she control other restrictions and spirit arrays, or only the Five Elements Divine Restriction?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, realizing he needed to be careful.</p><p>Kun Dao was gone, and Su Zinan, the Poison King, and the others had vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang drew out the golden sword.</p><p>Remembering the destroyed Boiling Snow Pill, Qin Sang felt a pang of regret, but he had no choice; if he hadn't destroyed it, Su Zinan would have obtained it.</p><p>After withstanding the impact of the Nine-Origin Earth Magnetism, the golden sword's luster was significantly dulled, turning dark gold.</p><p>Qin Sang sent a wisp of spiritual sense to the sword.  He was surprised to find that it wasn't a spirit treasure or a magic treasure, but an object similar to a jade slip.</p><p>Due to its material and unique refinement method, the sword contained preserved sword intent, acting as both protection and a seal.  A regular jade slip would have been destroyed in the explosion.</p><p>Stored in such a precious golden sword, it must be either a top-tier cultivation technique or some crucial information.</p><p>The jade sword was probably similar, but unfortunately, it was destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang’s interest in the golden sword greatly increased, but he also found it troublesome.</p><p>The sword had suffered damage, weakening the seal. While not difficult to break, it had become sensitive.  Forcibly breaking the seal might cause it to collapse, repeating the jade sword’s fate.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang hesitated, a flame suddenly erupted from the direction of the Celestial Ladder.</p><p>Someone was ascending. Qin Sang’s expression tightened. He didn’t delay, analyzing the sword's seal while rushing towards the ladder.</p><p>The Uninscribed Jade Tablet was his top priority; the immortal pendant came second.</p><p>Di Shushan's location is exceptional.  The Wuxiang Sect has meticulously landscaped the scenery, creating a breathtaking panorama of ever-changing views.</p><p>Qin Sang, uninterested in the beauty, swiftly moved through the mountains, carefully avoiding any known protective formations.  Even so, reaching the Celestial Stairway took considerable effort.</p><p>By this point, Qin Sang had a good understanding of Di Shushan's layout.  It was no wonder one had to ascend via the Celestial Stairway; most of Di Shushan's structures were located on either side, towering pagodas and lofty buildings rising high, many areas shrouded in dense fog, giving them an otherworldly appearance.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A gust of wind swept across the Celestial Stairway, revealing Qin Sang's figure.  He looked up to see a monumental archway bearing the inscription "Di Shushan," written in powerful calligraphy.  A single glance caused a slight stinging sensation in his eyes, as if imbued with intense sword intent that pierced his very being, unsettling his mind.</p><p>Definitely the work of a top-tier sword cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang knew that passing through the archway marked the true entry to Di Shushan.  Looking around, he couldn't see Su Zinan or the others.  Above on the Celestial Stairway, disturbed by the intruders, the sky was shifting, light and shadows flashing, obscuring any view of people.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped through the archway, instantly feeling a prickling sensation on his scalp, as if a sword truly pointed at him, a clear warning.</p><p>Along the way, he noticed traces of broken seals, residual energy with very distinct characteristics – the unmistakable work of Zi Lei Zhenren.  The signs of combat were minimal, making it impossible for Qin Sang to determine the outcome of the battle between the righteous and demonic cultivators.</p><p>He paused briefly, then increased his pace, soon climbing tens of thousands of steps. His figure suddenly stilled as his divine eye vision spotted two figures: the two Zhenren of Baguan.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw them, Zi Lei Zhenren seemed to sense something and abruptly turned, his purple-electric eyes flashing, his sharp gaze piercing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, his expression unchanged, as he stood with his hands behind his back.  Only then did he notice the two Zhenren were blocked by strange winds, a massive grey vortex swirling and effectively sealing their path.</p><p>The wind was quite powerful, yet strangely quiet, Qin Sang only heard a faint whooshing sound.</p><p>Before the vortex…</p><p>Hegao Zhenren summoned a green silk parasol. The parasol spun automatically, emitting beams of green light that continuously entered the vortex, but seemingly to little effect.</p><p>"To think that Fan Laomo refined a Yin Xuan Wind Pearl.  The wind array summoned by Zhu Wudao, enhanced by the Pearl, has become a major obstacle…"</p><p>Hegao Zhenren's brow furrowed, deeply engrossed in figuring out how to dispel the vortex.</p><p>The Yin Xuan Wind Pearl was a treasured artifact of the Tianhao Tower, requiring the collection of five naturally occurring types of dark winds and various precious materials for its creation.  Its single-use nature made it even more precious; it had been a long time since anyone refined one.</p><p>This treasure, combined with Tianhao Tower's Yin Xuan Demon Array, drastically increased its power.  Fan Laomo currently lacked manpower to set up the Demon Array.  Unexpectedly, he used it here in conjunction with the existing wind array of the Celestial Stairway, producing a surprisingly effective barrier against them.</p><p>Just as he spoke, Hegao Zhenren noticed Zi Lei Zhenren's actions and said solemnly, "Someone else has entered?"</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren hummed in response, withdrawing his gaze and continuing to observe the vortex.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren, however, was distracted. He snorted, "With Yue Zhangmen absent, these demons and monsters, seeing our lack of manpower, dare to make their move."</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren remained unconcerned. "Zhu Wudao broke through the Jade Pavilion, creating a flaw in the sword array. It's only natural that they could enter.  No need to worry about them, keep an eye on Zhu Wudao."</p><p>"I'm afraid there'll be a fight later, and someone will fish in troubled waters."</p><p>Hegao Zhenren's nature inclined him to eliminate both demonic cultivators and remnants of the Wuxiang Sect, but the situation and their strength wouldn't allow it.  The path to the Immortal Palace was cut off.  They could only seize the opportunity on Di Shushan before other factions gathered; otherwise, all their efforts would be in vain.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's next words, however, greatly surprised Hegao Zhenren.</p><p>"I consulted ancient texts and found a record mentioning a wordless jade tablet on Di Shushan, mysterious in origin, said to contain the opportunity for ascension to the Divine Transformation realm, allowing one to comprehend profound mysteries.  Upon entering the mountain, I observed that the summit's aura matched the ancient texts perfectly. The record is true. It must be Zhu Wudao who revealed the secret, trading the wordless jade tablet for their assistance. Since they were drawn here by the wordless jade tablet, let them fight."</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren’s tone was calm, showing no interest in the wordless jade tablet.</p><p>"The opportunity for Divine Transformation, can we just give it away?" Hegao Zhenren was puzzled. All their efforts weren't for obtaining the opportunity in the Immortal Palace's sword tomb to achieve Divine Transformation? He didn't understand why his senior brother had changed his mind.</p><p>"Junior Brother, you don't know," said Zi Lei Zhenren, shaking his head. "That inscriptionless jade disc is quite peculiar. For some reason, only those who have dedicated themselves to quiet cultivation on Di Shou Mountain for a long time, reaching a point of harmonious resonance with the disc, can truly understand its mysteries. Other cultivators may gain some benefits, but the effects are far less significant, of limited use to me, like a chicken leg.  Zhu Wu Dao certainly knows this, so he isn't worried about others competing with him."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>He Gao Zhenren, hearing these secrets, was even more puzzled. "If that's the case, why would Zhu Wu Dao risk being hunted down by us and insist on entering Di Shou Mountain?"</p><p>If it were as Zi Lei Zhenren said, the inscriptionless jade disc wasn't worth Zhu Wu Dao's risking his life, unless something else attracted him.</p><p>"He's likely after a spiritual treasure," Zi Lei Zhenren said solemnly. "This treasure is hidden deep within the Wu Xiang Sect's former grounds, its origins unknown.  It was sealed away in Di Shou Mountain after its discovery and rarely used.  Except for the high-ranking members of the Wu Xiang Sect, no one knows its form or location.  Legend claims it's incredibly powerful, having performed great service during the Demon Calamity.  There were even claims that it was the number one treasure in Central State!"</p><p>He Gao Zhenren was surprised and doubtful. "The number one treasure in Central State?  Such a bold claim! How does it compare to our Eight Scenic Palace Lamp?"</p><p>"They serve different purposes, so they can't be compared. If the rumors are true, even if I didn't achieve the Divine Transformation stage, possessing that treasure, I wouldn't fear any cultivator at the Divine Transformation stage."</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren pursued Zhu Wu Dao precisely because of this treasure.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren knew he couldn't enter the Sword Tomb, and ordinary opportunities were unlikely to elevate him to the Divine Transformation stage.  Having personally stirred up this chaos to protect the Eight Scenic Palace, he had to find another way, so he set his sights on this mysterious treasure.</p><p>The treasure was stored in Di Shou Mountain, disappearing after the Wu Xiang Sect's destruction, but it was highly likely still on the mountain.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's actions also indicated that there was a significant treasure on Di Shou Mountain; if not that treasure, then something else.  Keeping an eye on him was the right move.</p><p>But he didn't know where the treasure was located or what it looked like. The situation didn't allow for a slow search, so Zhu Wu Dao was a good guide.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren thought more deeply, asking, "If the treasure is so powerful, why didn't the Wu Xiang Sect use it when they were destroyed?"</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren sighed. "Back then, the Daoist and Buddhist masters discovered that surviving members of the Wu Xiang Sect had been corrupted by demonic influence and sealed themselves within Di Shou Mountain. Demonic corruption is terrible; it can be erased at first, but once the demonic intent takes root, it's irreversible. The Demon Calamity devastated the two southern states, and the cultivation world was already severely damaged. If it happened again, we couldn't possibly stop it. To prevent this, the masters took action against the Wu Xiang Sect, eliminating the threat. During the attack, they completely sealed Di Shou Mountain, forbidding anyone from entering, so naturally, no one could go up the mountain to retrieve the treasure..."</p><p>...</p><p>Behind the whirlwind.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao and Fan Lao Mo, one seated and the other standing.</p><p>They were not far from the Daoist masters, but the whirlwind between them was like a chasm. Seeing that the wind pearl and the whirlwind were holding the two masters at bay, both of them looked quite relaxed.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao sat cross-legged, his eyes closed, his fingers moving like wheels, sending out incantations. But they weren't directed at the whirlwind, instead flying towards the sides of the Heavenly Ladder.</p><p>On the stone steps on either side of the Heavenly Ladder, hidden incantations were embedded at intervals.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo stood beside Zhu Wu Dao, manipulating the wind pearl, looking up at the summit of Di Shou Mountain, then down at Zhu Wu Dao, chuckling, "As expected of a descendant of the Wu Xiang Sect, Junior Brother, you are remarkably familiar with this place.  All the formations and restrictions are at your fingertips."</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao continued his movements, modestly saying, "Senior Brother is too kind. My knowledge is merely superficial; I can only gradually activate the incantations on the Jade Path. If Senior Brother hadn't used the wind pearl to buy us some time, the formation wouldn't have been completed, and we wouldn't have been able to stop them in the slightest."</p><p>"That old bull-nosed Zi Lei is indeed not to be underestimated, but Junior Brother needn't worry. As the mastermind behind this chaos, that old Daoist has undoubtedly incurred the wrath of many, and the Eight Scenic Palace will have plenty of trouble in the future. As long as the Divine Transformation opportunity you mentioned is real, Senior Brother will ensure your safety," Fan Lao Mo said nonchalantly.</p><p>"The inscriptionless jade disc is above. Once the formation here is complete and they're trapped, I'll take Senior Brother there."</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao said calmly.</p><p>As he spoke, he cast more and more incantations. A faint glow appeared on either side of the jade steps, followed by lantern-like phantoms rising slowly.</p><p>These weren't lanterns, but wind lanterns, hollow in the middle, with streaks of green wind swirling around them.</p><p>A single wind lantern didn't have much power, but many together instantly formed a large-scale wind array.</p><p>In an instant, a fierce wind swept up and down the Heavenly Ladder!</p>
