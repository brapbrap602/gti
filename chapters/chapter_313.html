Chapter 306: Separation


The Hook Serpent was attacking the barrier.  The commotion was still minor, but with the serpent's continuous assault, the barrier's fluctuations would intensify, potentially breaking and attracting unwanted attention, revealing the hall's secrets.  Upon entering, they would discover the spiritual herbs gone and the lingering aura of Yu Kong and the others' deaths…

Luo Xingnan turned to leave.

Shangguan Lifeng, also unwilling to linger, sat up and swiftly cleaned the blood from his clothes.

Qin Sang erased the remaining traces within the hall, reinforced the barrier to buy time, feigned normalcy, and flew down the mountain towards the protective formation's entrance.  Fortunately, he hadn't alerted anyone.

Several Spirit Treasure Pavilions showed signs of conflict.  No one had yet noticed the anomaly in the Offering Hall.

Qin Sang and Luo Xingnan exchanged glances and entered the protective formation almost simultaneously.  

It was the same wind formation as before. Both Shangguan Lifeng and Qin Sang were familiar with its patterns, and before its full force could unleash, they located the exit wind tunnel.

“What are your plans after we leave?” Qin Sang asked the white-robed scholar as they flew towards the tunnel.

The scholar understood Qin Sang's implied question. After a moment's hesitation, he replied, “I am accustomed to solitude. I will not accompany you further. Farewell.”

This response was completely unexpected. Qin Sang hadn't anticipated the scholar choosing to travel alone, given Luo Xingnan's looming threat.  Unless, he was confident in evading Luo Xingnan's pursuit.  Qin Sang recalled Yun Youzi mentioning the scholar's exceptional escape techniques; it seemed he did have some reliance.

Qin Sang frowned in silence.  Shangguan Lifeng asked gravely, “Aren't you concerned about Luo Xingnan killing you for your treasures? You've witnessed his character firsthand. Do you truly believe he'll stop here? If we don't unite against him, we're sitting ducks.”

The scholar countered, “Unite? How? The Golden Ring Formation is destroyed, the Daoist Priest is exhausted, and you, Fellow Daoist Shangguan, are gravely injured with no time to recover. How many strikes can you muster? I'm not skilled in combat. Even with Daoist Priest Qingfeng, we're still sitting ducks.”

Shangguan Lifeng was momentarily speechless.  “Luo Xingnan is also injured, and Daoist Priest Qingfeng has talismans…”

“Luo Xingnan also has talismans.” The scholar sighed.  “I have something to say, if I may… If you are not certain of escaping him, you must carefully consider your options.  Surrendering to Luo Xingnan isn't the only possibility. There are many late Foundation Establishment cultivators in the cave now. You might find someone to offer protection…”

The wind tunnel was now within reach, the surrounding wind gusts beginning to coalesce.

“That is all. Farewell!”  The scholar bowed his hands, abruptly accelerated, and leaped into the tunnel first.

Outside the Autumn Wilds Market, the remnants of the Cloud Beast were scattered everywhere, but not a soul was in sight. Everyone was inside the cave seeking treasures.

Escape light flashed from the earth, revealing the white-robed scholar. Without pausing, he retrieved a talisman from his storage pouch and channeled spiritual energy into it with a gentle tap.

The talisman shattered, releasing a wisp of wind that settled upon him.

A pair of azure wings sprouted from his back.

With a gentle flap, his speed surged dramatically, surpassing even Luo Xingnan's earlier pace.

However, before he could travel far, a dazzling, meteor-like streak of escape light shot past him at an astonishing velocity.

Within the light, a bamboo boat.

Qin Sang hadn't been idle.  Clutching spirit stones and consuming countless pills, he had recovered a significant portion of his spiritual energy, enough to sustain the Spirit Bamboo Boat for a time.

Unfortunately, not for long.

The scholar stared in disbelief. He'd seen Yun Youzi use the Spirit Bamboo Boat, but its speed had only been slightly faster than early Foundation Establishment cultivators. He never imagined its full potential could be so astounding.

Then, realization struck, his expression changing drastically. He slammed his storage pouch, summoning a palm-sized incense burner.

The bronze burner was adorned with dragon carvings, their three heads converging at the top, wisps of smoke curling from their mouths.

“Pfft!”

The scholar spat a mouthful of blood onto the burner.

The burner absorbed the blood instantly, staining it crimson. Smoke gushed forth, twisting in the air, accompanied by faint dragon roars.  The three dragon carvings seemed to come alive.

The scholar, pale from blood loss, winced in pain, then resolutely uttered, “Explode!”

‘Boom!’

The burner shattered.

The smoke within surged out, transforming into a giant dragon.

At that moment, Luo Xingnan appeared, the yin-yang symbol on his compass spinning.  A white beam shot out, but just as it reached the scholar, the dragon roared, its body thrashing, shattering the white light and saving the scholar from the compass' capture.

Under the scholar's control, the smoke dragon lunged at Luo Xingnan.

The scholar, without looking back, flapped his wings and flew in the opposite direction from Qin Sang.

By the time Luo Xingnan dispelled the smoke dragon, both the Spirit Bamboo Boat and the scholar had gained considerable distance, fleeing in opposite directions.

Luo Xingnan's face darkened.  Without much hesitation, he abandoned the scholar and, maximizing his speed, pursued the Spirit Bamboo Boat.

Though unable to catch up immediately, he wasn't worried. The terrain was open. He only needed to tail them from afar.  He didn't believe Qin Sang, burdened with two injured companions, could maintain such speed indefinitely.

As expected, the boat's light dimmed, it wobbled, and then, changing course, it descended into a mountain range.  A clear sign of the user's depleted spiritual energy.

Luo Xingnan's eyes lit up, and he gave chase without hesitation.

The mountain peaks were sharp and treacherous.

Qin Sang landed, scanned the area, spotted a cave, and retracted the boat. He turned to Shangguan Lifeng.  “Fellow Daoist Shangguan, are you willing to fight Luo Xingnan?”

“He helped me avenge my master's death. I have fulfilled my agreement and repaid his favor.  Then he betrayed me. Let's consider us even.”  Shangguan Lifeng's voice was firm and resolute.

“The Daoist Priest brought me along, didn't abandon me. I am eternally grateful for this life-saving grace! If there is anything I can do, please command me. Though my strength is meager, I will give my all!”
