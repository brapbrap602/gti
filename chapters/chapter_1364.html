<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang entered the mountain gate.</p><p>Tan Yien, having been informed, hurriedly emerged from the main hall, bowing respectfully in greeting. Behind him followed a burly man with a calm demeanor, none other than Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Mu Yifeng, who originally possessed a carefree nature, a scruffy beard, and an unkempt appearance, now possessed a bearing far exceeding his past self, befitting the status of the master of a sect.</p><p>Old friends reunited.</p><p>Two hundred years apart.</p><p>The eyes of both Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng lit up.</p><p>Mu Yifeng's face was filled with joy, but a hint of hesitation flashed in his eyes. He opened his mouth, hesitating on how to address Qin Sang.</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu!"</p><p>Qin Sang flashed forward, landing before them, and used his former title from Lesser Hua Mountain, chiding, "When did you become an ascetic cultivator? You made me wait so long!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng's expression relaxed, the hesitation in his eyes vanished, and he grinned widely, laughing heartily. He nodded heavily, "Junior Brother Qin! Long time no see!"</p><p>Tan Yien greeted him as Martial Uncle and then wisely retreated.</p><p>Jing Yu and the white cat both went elsewhere to rest, not wanting to disturb the two.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng entered the main hall arm in arm.</p><p>After some reminiscing, the awkwardness between the two quickly disappeared, and they recalled the various events of the past, sighing with emotion.</p><p>"To think that after our parting back then, Junior Brother Qin would soar to the heavens, achieving such extraordinary accomplishments! As your senior brother, I was always apprehensive, wondering if, upon meeting again, you would still acknowledge me as your senior brother."</p><p>Mu Yifeng was filled with emotion.</p><p>His words came from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>The majesty of a Nascent Soul cultivator was inviolable.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang's strength was among the top of the Nascent Soul cultivators in the Northern Chen Realm.</p><p>The fellow disciples of the past were now separated by an insurmountable gulf.</p><p>"Without Senior Brother Mu, there would be no Qin Sang of today."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke solemnly, earnestly saying, "No matter what kind of person I, Qin Sang, eventually become, I will never forget the kindness you showed me before the Bronze Hall."</p><p>Mu Yifeng waved his hands repeatedly, not taking credit, "Junior Brother Qin, have you forgotten? In the Yun Cang Marsh, you saved my life first. If I were to attack my benefactor, what face would I have to shamelessly live in this world?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, his gratitude for Mu Yifeng not diminishing in the slightest.</p><p>If it were someone else, even facing their benefactor, they would not have the courage to defy a Nascent Soul Ancestor. Mu Yifeng not only shattered the Nine Fire Divine Peak, which was crucial to him, but also gambled his life.</p><p>"After returning, I wanted to see you, but unfortunately your temperament changed greatly. You secluded yourself on Jingyue Peak, never showing your face, and no one dared to intrude upon Jingyue Peak without permission… What happened after I escaped back then?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked about Mu Yifeng's experiences.</p><p>Mu Yifeng did not hide anything from Qin Sang, bitterly smiling, "Back then, I thought I had done it flawlessly, but now I realize I was too naive. How could these small tricks possibly deceive the Ancestor's discerning eyes? Fortunately, Fairy Chenyan pleaded with the Ancestor on my behalf and bestowed upon me healing pills, taking me out of the Violet Micro Palace. Later, she even allowed me to open a cave dwelling beneath Jingyue Peak, so the Ancestor did not cleanse the sect and kill this unworthy disciple…"</p><p>As he spoke, Mu Yifeng glanced at Qin Sang with a hint of ambiguity, "After leaving the Violet Micro Palace, Fairy Chenyan searched for you everywhere. Unable to find you for a long time, she assumed you had already fallen. I never expected you to hide so well."</p><p>Mu Yifeng was not clear about the relationship between Qin Sang and Chenyan.</p><p>All indications suggested that there was something going on between these two.</p><p>Mu Yifeng had heard something about Qin Sang being made into a human cauldron for Foundation Establishment, but the confirmed target was Real Person Ma Wu, who died on the battlefield not long after the Three Realms War began.</p><p>Mu Yifeng dared not associate such a thing with the peerless and refined Fairy Chenyan.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>Could Chenyan have truly been deluded by Dongyang Bo, cultivating that rubbish *Stone Bridge Zen*?</p><p>"Did she ever mention why she was looking for me?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Today was different from the past.</p><p>Even if Chenyan really had some ulterior motives, he was not afraid.</p><p>Chenyan had only formed her Nascent Soul a little over two hundred years ago. Although she was a prodigy with a Heavenly Spiritual Root, it was impossible for her to break through to the late stage of Nascent Soul in such a short time.</p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun was a monster, a genius among geniuses.</p><p>Mu Yifeng chuckled, "What was my status back then? How dare I aim so high! I can also be considered to have received a blessing in disguise. Not long after returning from the Violet Micro Palace, I had a feeling while healing and unexpectedly formed my Core smoothly. I was summoned by Fairy Chenyan. She first inquired about your situation, Junior Brother, and then bestowed upon me a magical treasure similar to the Nine Fire Divine Peak, guiding me in my subsequent cultivation. Fairy Chenyan is high above. From the time I entered Jingyue Peak for quiet cultivation until she left, I only saw her that one time."</p><p>As he spoke, Mu Yifeng squinted at Qin Sang.</p><p>His gaze seemed to say, "You still say the two of you have nothing to do with each other; she's even helping you repay your debts."</p><p>Qin Sang was also a little confused, unable to figure out Chenyan's attitude.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang would not naively think that Chenyan had any feelings for him.</p><p>Could it be guilt for implicating an innocent person?</p><p>"I remember that when you were at the Foundation Establishment stage, you broke through bottlenecks several times when you were seriously injured. I didn't expect the same to be true for Core Formation. I've met so many cultivators, Senior Brother Mu, you are one of a kind. No wonder you have a Golden Core late stage cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the difficult process of his own Core Formation, truly making people die of envy.</p><p>Mu Yifeng put away his teasing expression and said solemnly, "I only broke through to the Golden Core late stage a few days ago. With my talent, if I don't have any opportunities, I'm afraid it will take me decades of quiet cultivation to have any hope. This breakthrough is thanks to the Ancestor bestowing spiritual pills."</p><p>"Dongyang Bo?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, not surprised.</p><p>The master of a branch sect in Lesser Hua Mountain had to be at least in the Golden Core late stage to stabilize the situation.</p><p>Although spiritual pills that assisted Golden Core cultivators in breaking through small realms were also precious, they were easier to obtain than spiritual pills for breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage. Lesser Hua Mountain certainly didn't lack them.</p><p>Mu Yifeng hesitated for a moment, "After Fairy Chenyan left, I knew that I was not favored by the Ancestor, so I hid in Jingyue Peak for many years without going out. Half a year ago, Che Yutao failed to form his Core and perished. The Ancestor found me, explained the advantages and disadvantages to me, and I agreed after careful consideration."</p><p>After a pause, Mu Yifeng looked directly into Qin Sang's eyes, "In any case, everything I, Mu Yifeng, have today was obtained in Lesser Hua Mountain. Even after that incident, the sect did not cut off my cultivation resources. The sect's kindness cannot be forgotten. I cannot stand by and watch Lesser Hua Mountain decline!"</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu, rest assured, grievances are limited to those between me and Dongyang Bo," Qin Sang knew what Mu Yifeng was worried about and reassured him.</p><p>"As expected, I didn't misjudge you!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng relaxed, his face filled with relief, "The Ancestor has a few words that should be said to Junior Brother Qin. From now on, he will not step into Lesser Hua Mountain again. All affairs of Lesser Hua Mountain will be decided by me alone!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>He didn't expect Dongyang Bo to have such great courage, giving up the sect he had devoted his life to with a wave of his hand.</p><p>But it had to be admitted that this decision was very wise and most beneficial to Lesser Hua Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't let Mu Yifeng refuse.</p><p>"If Dongyang Bo keeps his word and doesn't come looking for trouble, I'll be too lazy to bother with him!"</p>
