<h1>Chapter 902: Thunder Cave</h1><p>The group dispersed around the pool.</p><p>One by one, Beast King Banners were activated, emitting a dazzling golden light.</p><p>The golden light was confined to the space near the pool.</p><p>The primordial spirits of the妖 beasts leaped out of the banners, roaring silently, then shattering into golden threads that merged into the formation. The small space was filled with sharp golden threads, which finally converged above the pool.</p><p>Unnoticed, on a withered Dark Thunderwood tree beside them, a butterfly clung, observing everything.</p><p>Qin Sang was also hidden nearby.</p><p>Seeing the Beast King Banners and several familiar faces, he confirmed these were his old adversaries, disciples of the Black Serpent Mountain sect.</p><p>Black Serpent Mountain had gone to great lengths, from hunting the Kui Dragon to disguising themselves as Bull Peak disciples and infiltrating Clarity Island.</p><p>Their scheme must be significant.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave, his face thoughtful.</p><p>Although his opponents were powerful and outnumbered him, and he didn't know what treasure Black Serpent Mountain sought, Qin Sang had no intention of retreating. Such a good opportunity, to not interfere would be a disservice to himself.</p><p>Not seeing the Fang young man was good news.</p><p>He was most wary of this person.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the blood sea that trapped Elder Lu and the other five Golden Core cultivators in the Bamboo Lodge was the Fang young man's doing. The other Black Serpent Mountain cultivators weren't this powerful.</p><p>Some mysteries were now solved.</p><p>One of Bull Peak's core inheritances was that thunder technique. No wonder the thunder contained Star Sha power. Qin Sang had been interested in that thunder technique, planning to seek it from Black Serpent Mountain later. Now he could settle it all at once.</p><p>Of course, it would be even better if he could seize the treasure Black Serpent Mountain coveted.</p><p>This wouldn't be easy.</p><p>The opponents were strong and possessed the Beast King Banners.</p><p>Snatching the prize from them would require the right moment.</p><p>Also, there were Golden Core cultivators from other sects at the entrance of Clarity Island, along with Elder Lu and the Fang young man, both formidable opponents. These were all variables.</p><p>Obtaining the treasure was secondary; escaping safely afterward was paramount.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze flickered.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Beast King Banner formation was finally ready.</p><p>The golden threads vanished, having condensed into a small golden knife pointed at the whirlpool.</p><p>Activating the Beast King Banners to achieve this transformation seemed to have taken a significant toll on them, but they had no choice to break the barrier. This barrier was likely set up by Sect Leader Lu of Falling Star Sect himself.</p><p>Fortunately, they had obtained a jade talisman that unlocked another layer. Otherwise, with their strength, even if they could break through, it would take a while, and the commotion would have alerted others.</p><p>"Beast King Blade! Descend!"</p><p>The black-robed man's voice was hoarse as he gave a low shout.</p><p>The golden knife trembled slightly, emitting a metallic sound, then abruptly plunged into the whirlpool.</p><p>The knife's speed was astonishing, disappearing into the whirlpool like a flash of gold.</p><p>After a brief silence, a loud boom erupted from the depths of the pool, and the ground shook violently. A pillar of white and gold light shot out.</p><p>Along with the soaring pillar of light, waves of chaotic energy swept outwards, instantly pulverizing the surrounding Dark Thunderwood trees.</p><p>‘Not good! Retreat!’</p><p>The black-robed man's expression changed drastically. He grabbed a Beast King Banner and retreated rapidly.</p><p>All present were battle-hardened Golden Core cultivators. Without needing a reminder, they all retreated. Even so, they were still affected.</p><p>For a moment, they were in disarray. Several Beast King Banners were damaged, and some coughed up blood from their injuries.</p><p>However, they didn't lose their composure.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't found an opportunity and sighed inwardly.</p><p>Fortunately, he had been alert and ordered the Skyeye Butterfly away from the pool before the golden knife broke the barrier.</p><p>Otherwise, even with its exceptional concealment abilities, the butterfly would have been exposed if caught in the aftershock.</p><p>The most dangerous part was the pillar of light. It surged dozens of feet high before scattering into a gentle rain of light, and the tremors instantly spread throughout Clarity Island.</p><p>The black-robed man's expression was grim. Without time to recover, he flashed back to the pool's edge. The waves had blasted a large crater in the pool.</p><p>At the bottom of the crater, a white stone staircase led down into the earth.</p><p>Seeing this, the black-robed man's anger turned to joy. He gave a quick order and rushed down the stairs.</p><p>The others also took out spirit pills, suppressing their injuries, and raised their Beast King Banners again.</p><p>With the acute senses of Golden Core cultivators, others would have definitely noticed the disturbance and were on their way. They could appear any moment.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>Just as they adjusted their formation, they heard sounds of something approaching. Looking towards the sky, they saw two streaks of light rapidly approaching.</p><p>More followed behind.</p><p>All the Golden Core cultivators on the island had been drawn here.</p><p>They could only hope their Second Senior Brother acted quickly to avoid a fierce battle.</p><p>They exchanged glances, their eyes filled with worry.</p><p>The black-robed man had already entered the staircase. Time was of the essence. He didn't pause, rushing downwards at full speed. Fortunately, there seemed to be no other barriers, and he reached the bottom unhindered.</p><p>A stone door blocked his path.</p><p>The door was incredibly thick, with shimmering silver-white light resembling tiny electric snakes. It was sealed by a restriction, but with enemies approaching, there was no time to break it.</p><p>The black-robed man took a deep breath, scanned the door, and after a moment's thought, flicked his fingers. Strange runes flew from his fingertips and landed on the door.</p><p>The runes' positions followed a specific pattern.</p><p>When the last rune landed, the door suddenly flashed with dazzling silver light, then vanished. All the electric snakes disappeared, leaving an ordinary door.</p><p>The tense black-robed man relaxed, his face filled with elation. He pushed the door open with a 'creak'.</p><p>The next moment, he cried out and hurriedly circulated his True Essence to protect his eyes.</p><p>Behind the door was a hall.</p><p>The hall was incredibly bright, almost blinding. A mortal would be instantly blinded, as the light contained the power of thunder.</p><p>In the center of the hall, there was a circular pit in the floor.</p><p>The pit was filled with a layer of shimmering silver liquid. It appeared calm but radiated a violent aura. It was incredibly pure thunder energy, condensed into a liquid form!</p><p>Seeing the Thunder Liquid Pool, the black-robed man's face was filled with awe.</p><p>If this thunder liquid erupted, standing here would mean certain death.</p><p>Fortunately, countless runes were carved on the walls and around the pool, forming a massive spirit array that sealed it. Only a faint trace of thunder energy leaked out due to age.</p><p>Above the Thunder Liquid Pool, a strange stone platform floated.</p>
