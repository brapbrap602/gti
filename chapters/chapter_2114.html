<h1>Chapter 2104: Preparations</h1><p>Storm Realm is hemmed in on one side by the Foul Lands and on the other by the Outsiders; previously, there was no escape.</p><p>The news Qin Sang brought is of immense significance to them.  Even if they fall in battle, as long as their legacy survives, they will face their ancestors without shame.</p><p>The assembled erupted in gratitude, some beginning to consider which disciples to send.</p><p>The refuge has limited space; each faction receives only a small quota.  Choosing the most talented or the most steady requires careful thought.</p><p>Qin Sang observed their expressions, nodding inwardly.  Their gratitude seemed genuine; before, it had been fear; now, it was a mixture of fear and respect.</p><p>“Once you've chosen, send them to the Green Sheep Temple. I will escort them to the refuge...”</p><p>Qin Sang did not reveal the refuge’s location, a fact everyone understood.</p><p>If the situation becomes irreversible, it will be Storm Realm's last hope; the more secluded, the better.</p><p>Next, instead of addressing their most pressing concerns regarding techniques and spells, Qin Sang turned to Yuan Zhu, Bao Zhengnan, and Elder Fang.  “The Changyou tribe has withdrawn from the Demon Sea and the Canglang Sea. Who is willing to return?”</p><p>Someone questioned, “Is it not premature to reclaim the Demon Sea and the Canglang Sea now?”</p><p>The Central Plains is vast enough that overpopulation is not an immediate concern. The three tribes constantly infight over resources.</p><p>Now, preparing for war against the Changyou tribe, we should unite our forces, making Storm Realm a single fist, rather than dispersing our strength.</p><p>“My strategy requires someone to garrison the Demon Sea and the Canglang Sea.  Moreover, holding these areas will be advantageous in the future struggle for Azure Spirit Qi,” Qin Sang stated, his gaze on Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Yuan Zhu knew that the Demon Sea tribes had made a grave mistake, and they had no choice but to abide by Qin Sang’s will.</p><p>Others, even if they didn't annihilate the Demon Sea tribes, would certainly scatter them, demoting all cultivators to mere soldiers to prevent a repeat of this incident.</p><p>Qin Sang allowed them to retain their tribes and ancestral lands, to continue their lineage. Even the leading Jiao Long clan wasn't destroyed; the weaker members were largely unaffected.</p><p>Yuan Zhu became the new leader of the Jiao Long clan and the Demon Sea. Firstly, few Demon Sea masters remained; secondly, Qin Sang’s will stood behind him.</p><p>He wasn't naive enough to believe that, in such a significant matter, a thousand years' worth of friendship would allow him to bargain.</p><p>Qin Sang could give the Demon Sea a chance at redemption, but there wouldn't be a second.</p><p>“My clan will guard the Demon Sea for the Grand Master,” Yuan Zhu rose, bowing.</p><p>The others looked at Yuan Zhu with varied expressions.</p><p>This conflict largely stemmed from the Demon Sea tribes' attempt to act independently, to reclaim their ancestral lands.</p><p>They could now return, but not in the way they had envisioned. Yuan Zhu's words signified their complete submission.</p><p>Now, the Demon Sea is Qin Sang’s Demon Sea, not the demons’ Demon Sea.</p><p>Indeed, it's more than just the Demon Sea!</p><p>Some pondered. Before Qin Sang's return, Storm Realm had never seen a single will dominate all; even the Glass Fairy had sought the support of various factions and sects, balancing their interests.</p><p>They realized they must carefully consider how to manage their relationship with Green Sheep Temple going forward.</p><p>“Our Four Sacred Palaces will garrison the Canglang Sea,” Bao Zhengnan rose, his voice resounding, breaking the silence.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly; he wouldn't remain here forever, and long-term plans were necessary.</p><p>The Demon Sea and the Canglang Sea are remote; he needed someone to watch over the demon tribes, and the Four Sacred Palaces were ideally suited.  Green Sheep Temple would establish a branch there in the future; with the Four Sacred Palaces' assistance, the demons would pose no threat.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to Elder Fang, who reclined in his chair, his cicada wings trembling slightly.  “Our sacred mountain has already moved to the Central Plains. Aside from that, we have nothing else to cherish. Moreover, our clan is inherently weak, and managing our current territory has nearly depleted our resources. We are unable to support another relocation. We beg the Grand Master to allow us to remain on the Central Plains.”</p><p>For the Witch tribe, returning to the Canglang Sea would place them between humans and demons; remaining in the Central Plains was better. Although under constant human observation, the vastness of the Central Plains made things easier for them.</p><p>Elder Fang only wished for his tribe to recuperate, harboring no other ambition. He wasn't worried about being watched by the humans.</p><p>With the situation in the Demon Sea and Canglang Sea settled, Qin Sang turned to the East Sea tribal leaders.</p><p>“Black Lion,” Qin Sang called.</p><p>“Your servant is here, Grand Master. Please command,” Black Lion responded obsequiously.</p><p>“The Dragon Whales and their subordinates are demoted to soldiers. I task you with integrating them.”</p><p>“I obey!”</p><p>Black Lion rejoiced; this clearly meant he would replace the Dragon Whales as the King of the East Sea.</p><p>Beyond this, the Three Teach Alliance of Zhongzhou has vanished. Qin Sang didn't interfere much; as long as a new "Three Teach Alliance" doesn't emerge, he's happy to see the various sects vying with each other.</p><p>The West and North Seas remained largely unchanged.</p><p>From then on, the Storm World's structure largely conformed to Qin Sang's expectations.  His vision of the future involves Dharma Altars spread throughout the land, with branches of the Qingyang Temple established in each region – this is the nascent form of his ideal Daoist establishment.</p><p>With the Storm World's structure settled, Qin Sang finally got down to business. He produced a jade slip, activated it with his spiritual sense, and revealed its contents to everyone.</p><p>This was the method for forging Dharma Altars.  In the future, various clans and sects could follow this method to forge their own altars, but these would only be branch altars. The core of the Thunder Altar would remain in Qin Sang's control.</p><p>Even if the enemy obtained these methods, they wouldn't be able to fully understand the Thunder Altar.</p><p>"While traveling the Great Thousand World, I obtained this altar array method and witnessed its power firsthand – even now, I still find it awe-inspiring.  If you all follow this method to build Dharma Altars and work together to activate them, you can help me deter external enemies and protect the entire Storm World!"</p><p>To prevent leaks, Qin Sang didn't describe the altar's power in detail; everyone just needed to obey orders.</p><p>Even so, everyone could sense the extraordinary nature of these altars from the forging method. Once they were spread throughout the Storm World, their power would undoubtedly be astonishing.</p><p>The concern among the people was that the materials needed for forging the altars were extremely rare and expensive – small sects simply couldn't afford them, especially since some were completely unheard of.</p><p>"You needn't worry. I prepared all the rare and precious materials before I came.  It's just that the Qingyang Temple lacks manpower, and I have other matters to attend to. I need you all to help forge the altars and assign personnel to guard them. Each Dharma Altar is extremely important. You must choose locations according to the requirements; don't take this lightly."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, and Li Yu Fu led people to distribute the materials one by one, issuing warnings as they went.</p><p>With the materials in hand, everyone's doubts were dispelled.</p><p>After that, they finalized some other matters, and Qin Sang dismissed everyone.</p><p>What a terrifying day!</p><p>Exiting the hall, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Elder Fang was about to fly out of the hall when Qin Sang stopped him.</p><p>"Elder Fang, wait."</p><p>Elder Fang was startled, unsure why Qin Sang had singled him out.  He reasoned that the Witch Clan hadn't done anything wrong, so he calmed himself. After everyone else had left, he asked, "Great Real Person, why have you kept me behind?"</p><p>"Elder Fang, aren't you curious about the Witch Clan of the Great Thousand World?" Qin Sang asked with a smile.</p><p>Elder Fang was naturally curious, but for various reasons, he hadn't dared to ask Qin Sang. Since Qin Sang had brought it up, he no longer hesitated.  "Great Real Person, have you been to the Witch Clan's territory? How are they faring?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "I intended to travel to the Witch Clan's territory, but unfortunately, the Witch Clan and humanity are not on good terms. They were enemies in ancient times and fought a great war, the effects of which linger to this day."</p><p>"Enemies…"</p><p>Elder Fang fell silent, sighing inwardly. He had long suspected that if the three races fought tooth and nail in the small Storm World, peace in the Great Thousand World was impossible.</p><p>He said heavily, "Great Real Person, how do you plan to deal with our clan?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "Elder Fang, you misunderstand. The grievances and hatreds of the Great Thousand World are none of our concern. To be frank, once the situation in the Storm World stabilizes, I intend to travel to the Witch Clan. I plan to take a few Witch Clan companions, using the identities of scattered Witch Clan members as a cover. However…"</p><p>At the prospect of returning to his people, Elder Fang was initially overjoyed. But when he heard Qin Sang's tone change, he knew things wouldn't be so simple and listened intently.</p><p>"The Storm World holds too many secrets. To be safe, I need people who only know of your Witch Clan, not the Storm World, and are completely ignorant of all its secrets," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Elder Fang immediately guessed the reason and tentatively asked, "Is this related to the celestial palaces that ascended to the higher realms?"</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied.</p><p>"I understand," Elder Fang wisely refrained from further questions.  "I will carefully select a group of infants and personally teach them, then hand them over to the Great Real Person."</p><p>"There's no rush. This turmoil won't subside overnight. I need to make thorough preparations before I leave," Qin Sang said.</p><p>But Elder Fang chuckled wryly. "Unfortunately, I can't wait that long."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised and looked closely at Elder Fang. "Elder Fang, you…"</p><p>"My soul is fused with the body of a Spirit Cicada, violating the Dao. My soul and body are incompatible, and no matter what I try, I can't truly rectify it.  Breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage was a stroke of luck.  The price I paid was my lifespan, which is now less than fifty years. With my talent, there's no way I can break through to the Void Refinement stage in such a short time. However, to see the Great Real Person return in my lifetime, I have no regrets in death.  In the future, the entire Witch Clan will undoubtedly follow the Great Real Person's lead and obey your commands. I hope the Great Real Person will take care of us."</p><p>These words were heartfelt, a rare sight in Elder Fang.</p><p>Qin Sang was helpless in this situation.</p><p>Old Master Fang's condition wasn't simply a depletion of vital energy; only a miracle could reverse it.  He, however, accepted his fate calmly, discussing his views on life and death with Qin Sang.  Qin Sang didn't entirely agree with some of his points, but didn't argue.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang asked, "I haven't previously understood, are there any clan divisions within your Witch tribe?"</p><p>"Ancient texts record that the ancient Witch tribe was indeed divided into different clans, each said to have different traditions. To maintain blood purity, intermarriage between clans was restricted. But we've long since become a chaotic mess…"</p><p>Master Fang sighed, "Because our lineage is broken, since recorded history began, our cultivation has borrowed from human methods, and our customs have also become similar to humans'.  Except for the Great Witch Priest, there are only sects below, and the concept of clans is long gone."</p><p>Master Fang's account largely matched Qin Sang's previous understanding of Witch history.  The fact that the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea are adjacent, the Demon tribe has an ancestral land, yet the Witch tribe lost its heritage from the beginning, eventually being surpassed by humans, was striking.  What exactly transpired in the Storm Realm between the three races in ancient times holds many unknown secrets.</p><p>"Have you ever heard of the Hao Bo clan?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Master Fang pondered for a moment, then said, "Never."</p><p>"The Hao Bo clan was a major clan of the ancient Witch tribe. I once accidentally entered an ancient ruin left by the Hao Bo clan and made some discoveries, but haven't had time to organize them. When I have time, I will send someone to your manor. It contains some of the Hao Bo clan's legacy; you might try cultivating it, and in the future, call yourselves descendants of the Hao Bo clan…"</p><p>Qin Sang, possessing a small secluded realm, had almost completely emptied the ruins, unfortunately failing to obtain the complete Hao Bo clan heritage, but it was enough for them to study for a long time.  Once the Witch tribe achieved a certain level, Qin Sang would arrange for them to cultivate sacrificial insects.</p><p>Master Fang rejoiced, "Master Fang, on behalf of the entire tribe, expresses our deepest gratitude! This kindness will never be forgotten!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, he didn't believe any kindness could withstand the erosion of time; the Witch tribe only needed to be obedient and useful to him.</p><p>An incense stick later, Master Fang took his leave, leaving Qin Sang alone in the hall.  He pondered for a moment, then flew out of the hall and arrived at the northern part of the Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The mountain range here had been moved, creating a large plain and lake; demonic energy soared into the sky, and demon soldiers were being transported here.  The demon soldiers were led by the Dragon Whale and the Phoenix King, respectively commanding the birds and beasts and the aquatic species.  However, Qin Sang knew they harbored resentment, so the true commanders were the two Demon Marquises.</p><p>"Greetings, Great Master!"</p><p>Gui Hou and Luo Hou, seeing Qin Sang arrive, quickly stepped forward to pay their respects.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his gaze sweeping across the demon soldiers. Including the two Demon Marquises, they were already a considerable force. But for a Nascent Soul mid-stage envoy from the Five Thunder Temple, they were still too weak. A legitimate disciple of a Daoist sect's military arts hall, if promoted normally, would now at least have a Nascent Soul early-stage demon general and countless demon soldiers under their command. This is the terrifying aspect of military arts hall cultivators; naturally, raising so many demon soldiers is also extremely difficult.</p><p>"Continue training, don't teach them the 'Celestial Demon Transformation' yet," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>Powerful techniques should not be easily imparted. These demon soldiers were under duress, not genuinely submissive; even if they didn't dare openly rebel, they would drag their feet on the battlefield.  Later, there would be rewards and punishments within the demon soldiers; Gui Hou and Luo Hou were both experienced and Qin Sang didn't need to worry about it.</p><p>At this time, the observers had not yet left; they dared not disturb Qin Sang and went to visit Li Yu Fu and others; the Qingyang Temple was brightly lit and bustling.</p><p>After instructing the demon soldiers, Qin Sang ordered the two Demon Marquises to lead them to the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea to help Bao Zhengnan and Yuan Zhu cast their altars.  Then, he flew into the air, entered Luye, and arrived before Si Lu's cave abode.</p><p>The cave door opened.  Si Lu personally came out to greet him, glancing downwards and asking, "Qin Brother, is everything arranged? When do we contact the Zhu Yan tribe?" </p>
