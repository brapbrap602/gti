<h1>Chapter 1420: The Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace</h1><p>Chapter 1420: The Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace</p><p>Qin Sang held the jade pendant, feeling a coolness,</p><p>and a heaviness.</p><p>Tan Hao had given him more than just the pendant; he had given him hope.</p><p>Qin Sang squeezed it tightly.</p><p>Although he didn't know how many years it would be before he could go to Zhongzhou, and the possibility of encountering Gui Mu was extremely slim, Qin Sang still expressed his gratitude.</p><p>Ya Gu's face was rosy, her breathing even.</p><p>To outsiders, she would appear to be asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and put away the jade pendant.</p><p>Then, Tan Hao recounted their subsequent experiences.</p><p>“Senior knew a path through the storm belt. We arrived at the North Sea, only to find ourselves in demon territory, narrowly escaping pursuit by a demon king. After much difficulty, senior retrieved a previously prepared contingency plan.  Once his injuries healed and some of his strength returned, he infiltrated Xuan Tian Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted Tan Hao's mention of Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>“What was the senior's cultivation level?”</p><p>Qin Sang mentally assessed Gui Mu's strength.  Having been sealed by Tian Yue Shang Ren, she shouldn't be at the Nascent Soul stage, right?</p><p>However, not fearing Xuan Tian Palace and openly provoking it were two different things.</p><p>Even the Hun Mo Elder, and some top experts at the middle Nascent Soul stage, possessed the strength to stand up to Xuan Tian Palace, and Xuan Tian Palace would try to avoid offending them.  If they were angered, and retribution fell upon Xuan Tian Palace disciples, the Palace would be in a terrible mess.</p><p>But even the Hun Mo Elder could not act recklessly within Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Tan Hao said apologetically, “My cultivation is low. When senior caused havoc in Xuan Tian Palace, I only followed instructions, doing a few minor tasks outside. I didn't witness senior's power at his peak…”</p><p>As he spoke, Tan Hao paused, suddenly remembering something.  “Senior seemed to mention that the Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace was…unwell, and hadn't appeared in public for a long time. I also heard some rumors that the Palace Master’s rise to fame predates even the Hun Mo Elder.”</p><p>“Unwell.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these two words.</p><p>In their brief encounter, the power the Hun Mo Elder displayed was not simply that of someone who had just broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage; he was a seasoned powerhouse who had dominated the boundless sea for many years.</p><p>Let's assume the Xuan Tian Palace Palace Master is stronger than the Hun Mo Elder.</p><p>There were many reasons for a cultivator’s unusual state.</p><p>For example, the failure of an attempt to use forbidden techniques to break through, resulting in backlash.</p><p>Or a bizarre longevity technique.</p><p>Or severe injuries from a tribulation.</p><p>…</p><p>“Hmm, the possibility of severe injuries from a tribulation is high. The power of Heavenly Tribulations increases with each ascension.  Without breaking through to the Divine Transformation stage, grand cultivators will eventually fall.”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, pondering silently, “Such injuries are extremely difficult to recover from. No wonder Xuan Tian Palace was first infiltrated by Gui Mu and then had its treasures stolen by the person in white.”</p><p>He thought of the ice box quietly resting in his Qian Jun Ring.</p><p>Could it contain a nautical chart?</p><p>On second thought, he considered it unlikely. The person in white’s strength was comparable to that of an early Nascent Soul cultivator; they wouldn’t have the ability to go to Zhongzhou, so a nautical chart would be of limited value to them.</p><p>If the person in white was a Xuan Tian Palace cultivator, they would have access to the chart once their cultivation reached a certain level; there was no need to take such a great risk.</p><p>“Aside from the Palace Master, the others pose little threat.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and gestured for Tan Hao to continue.</p><p>Next came their experiences at Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>Gui Mu seemed to have failed to obtain what she wanted from Xuan Tian Palace, so she risked breaking the seal to infiltrate Jing Hai Sect and obtain the nautical chart there.</p><p>“Senior said that when Jing Hai Sect faced a crisis, it used all its strength to create a seal. The Golden Peak and the Buddhist Pagoda are like two pillars of the seal, and now they can only barely support it.  The medicinal gardens and other places also affect the stability of the seal to varying degrees.”</p><p>Tan Hao looked at Qin Sang, knowing he had already noticed this.  “Damaging the restrictions in these places will cause the seal to collapse faster.  Senior opened the Buddhist Pagoda and took the treasures inside, but only harvested a few of the most precious herbs from the medicinal garden. The Golden Peak contains several magical artifacts, which senior did not take.  These things were meant for me to take after I reached the Nascent Soul stage.  That would have also been the day Jing Hai Sect was destroyed.”</p><p>Tan Hao looked helpless and heartbroken.</p><p>These treasures were Gui Mu’s compensation to him for being unable to save Tan Jie and fulfill their agreement.</p><p>Once Tan Hao reached the Nascent Soul stage and obtained these treasures, he would be wealthier than most sects.</p><p>The bird had flown from his grasp.</p><p>However, remembering the time spent at Jing Hai Sect, and the benefits he had gained from the morning bells and evening drums under Gui Mu's guidance, Tan Hao felt a little relieved.</p><p>A Nascent Soul breakthrough opportunity was more valuable than any treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He'd noticed something was amiss.  The protective glow around the pagoda was dimmer than usual, indicating that the Ghost Mother had already been inside.</p><p>He wondered what treasures lay within, besides the nautical chart.  Were there any Spirit-Calming Incenses?  However, the incense wasn't a necessity for him.</p><p>"We should act quickly," Tan Hao sighed, "Let's harvest the most valuable herbs and leave this dangerous place."</p><p>Learning that the Demon Elder had been drawn here, Tan Hao gave up on the treasures within the pagoda.  He didn't believe Qin Sang had the strength to contend with the Demon Elder. If the Demon Elder discovered they'd gotten there first, their situation would become perilous.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal, lost in thought. While talking with Tan Hao, he continuously observed the surroundings through his Nascent Soul puppet, monitoring the Demon Elder's movements.</p><p>Now it was certain. Five Nascent Soul cultivators had entered the Jing Hai Sect. Besides the Demon Elder and Zhi Jie Zhenren, they were all unfamiliar faces.  Sect Master Mu and Qi Wang were nowhere to be seen; their fates were likely grim.  The distance was too great for Qin Sang to discern their expressions.</p><p>Of the three newcomers, one was a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, and the other two were early-Nascent Soul cultivators.  On the surface, they weren't clashing with the Demon Elder, whether out of fear or because they'd already agreed on a distribution plan, he couldn't tell.</p><p>The arrival of so many people was unexpected.</p><p>"It seems the Demon Elder doesn't understand the Jing Hai Sect's protective array as well as I thought," Qin Sang mused.  "Without the guidance of the Fire Jade Centipede, the old devil may have actively sought help to break the array together."</p><p>This explained the Demon Elder's ambush and collaboration with others.  After all, the four of them had an agreement and would naturally unite against external threats.  For the Demon Elder, the three newcomers were few in number, unlikely to fully trust each other, and therefore posed no significant threat.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's original plan, with only the Demon Elder and Zhi Jie Zhenren present, he would have remained hidden, waiting for an opportunity. If a Buddhist treasure appeared, he would seize the chance and make his escape.</p><p>But in the current situation, with no opportunity to sow discord, Qin Sang had to prioritize his own safety.  Facing five opponents alone was beyond his arrogance. He had already obtained the Myriad Spirits Fruit, achieving his goal. Weighing the risks and benefits, he would most likely choose to retreat.</p><p>However, the unexpected encounter with Tan Hao gave Qin Sang a new idea.</p>
