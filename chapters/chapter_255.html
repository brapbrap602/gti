<h1>**Chapter 248: Counterattack**</h1><p>This time, Elder Di Que did not directly assign Qin Sang. A strange ripple appeared from his body, and a haunting melody emerged from his mouth. Then, out of nowhere, roaring flames appeared. They illuminated the stone steps, but there was not a hint of heat.</p><p>As the flames grew darker, Qin Sang actually felt the temperature around him rising.</p><p>The heat seemed to be coming from the depths of his soul. Even with his cultivation level, he found it unbearable, and a thin layer of sweat appeared on his forehead.</p><p>When he looked at Elder Di Que again, he saw that he had completely changed.</p><p>His physical body had disappeared, and he had transformed into the appearance of a Fire Soaring Monkey. In terms of form and aura, he was indistinguishable from an actual Fire Soaring Monkey. Even the golden light in his eyes was identical.</p><p>A perfect copy!</p><p>His strange, golden gaze fell upon Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, and he secretly guarded himself. He had been racking his brains for ways to escape during this time, but he had not found an opportunity.</p><p>Then, Elder Di Que sent out a ball of Illusory Divine Melody power. He landed it in front of Qin Sang and pointed at the lava lake, saying, "You go first!"</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the ball of Illusory Divine Melody power, but he could not disguise himself as perfectly as Elder Di Que. He knew that Elder Di Que wanted him to be the bait and clear a path for him!</p><p>Qin Sang did not resist and immediately did as he was told.</p><p>With a thought, he donned the Fire Garment and repeated the all-too-familiar actions. His figure shot out like lightning, charging into the lava lake with the fastest speed possible.</p><p>The monkeys noticed Qin Sang, and the situation immediately became chaotic.</p><p>Elder Di Que let out a strange laugh and suddenly vanished on the spot. In the next moment, he appeared on the edge of the lava lake.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Fire Soaring Monkeys in the lava lake roared and surrounded Qin Sang. They did not notice that a being that looked like one of their "own" had quietly slipped into their midst.</p><p>Several Fire Soaring Monkeys next to Elder Di Que noticed this "stranger." They casually glanced at him and then looked away, roaring and charging towards Qin Sang. They clearly mistook him as one of their own.</p><p>Qin Sang fought back with difficulty, but his gaze was always locked on Elder Di Que.</p><p>He saw with his own eyes how Elder Di Que's figure moved like smoke, weaving through the countless Fire Soaring Monkeys. Taking advantage of the chaos, he made his way towards the Crimson Golden Vine, without alerting any of the monkeys.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. He had originally thought that the monkeys possessed Fiery Golden Eyes and could see through disguise techniques. The possibility of Elder Di Que succeeding was not high, at most fifty-fifty. He was most likely to be spotted by the monkeys.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Elder Di Que's disguise was so perfect that he had not raised any alarms among the monkeys until now. The Illusory Divine Melody must have some ability that Qin Sang was unaware of.</p><p>At that moment, he saw Elder Di Que clearly target the golden fruit on the Crimson Golden Vine and head straight for it. He was about to reach his goal!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and he suddenly detonated the Illusory Divine Melody power within his body without holding back.</p><p>It had not been long since Qin Sang had entered the lava lake, so the Illusory Divine Melody power within his body had only been consumed slightly. When he suddenly detonated it, the area around him seemed to transform into an unfathomable vortex. The vast divine melody took the form of fire. With Qin Sang at its center, it surged out of the vortex, spreading out into a sea of flames.</p><p>Thousands of fire waves erupted all at once!</p><p>The scorching flames reached the heavens!</p><p>The Fire Soaring Monkeys that were affected by the sea of flames were instantly extinguished, along with their original Fire Origin power. Even the monkeys that had fused together, becoming extremely powerful, could not withstand the sudden impact. Their bodies cracked inch by inch.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>These monkeys roared madly at the sky and frantically swung their massive clubs, hitting the oncoming fire waves. They could not understand why they, who were supposed to be at home in the flames, felt the terror of death.</p><p>Then, they suddenly gave up resisting and turned on each other, beginning to fuse again.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half of the hundreds of giant Fire Soaring Monkeys remained. The fusion did not stop. One hundred, fifty...</p><p>Looking at the monkeys who were growing stronger with each fusion, Qin Sang felt as fragile as an ant, as if they could easily crush him. But instead of panicking, he felt joy!</p><p>This was the pattern he had discovered after testing and exploring time and time again.</p><p>The monkeys' fusion was not a way for them to devour each other. It was merely a means to deal with powerful enemies. Once the enemy disappeared, they would return to their original forms, and their strength would not change at all from before they fused.</p><p>Because of this, the monkeys themselves had no strong desire to fuse, and they would stop fusing once they reached a point where they could eliminate their enemies.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate and detonated Illusion Divine Note, which was to give Fei Hou an illusion, as if a formidable enemy had invaded and it had to fuse with others and upgrade its strength.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose is to artificially create strong enemies for the Old Man of Di Que!</p><p>The Old Man of Di Que can disguise himself perfectly, and once he moves to take the Scarlet Gold Vine Fruit, he will definitely be discovered by the monkey horde.</p><p>When the Old Man of Di Que shows up and Fei Hou starts to fuse with others, it will be too late. It will be impossible to stop the Old Man of Di Que. Now Qin Sang is preparing a few divine monkeys for him in advance! When the Old Man of Di Que is entangled with the divine monkeys, that will be when Qin Sang can escape!</p><p>The people on the outside have already started joining forces to break the ban. As long as he leaves here and joins them, as a disciple of the sect, it should deter the old ghost from acting rashly. He and the old ghost have no grudges, and he has helped the ghost to steal spiritual fruits. When the old ghost sees that his task is impossible, he will probably not pester him further.</p><p>Qin Sang has never had any expectations for the Old Man of Di Que's so-called reward.</p><p>Qin Sang is most afraid that the old ghost will taste the sweetness and hold him back, using him as a pathfinder all the time.</p><p>The Old Man of Di Que is definitely capable of doing this!</p><p>Qin Sang has fought Fei Hou a long time ago and is very familiar with Fei Hou. Moreover, he has always faced only his one opponent, Fei Hou, and without any changes, he was able to survive after testing many times.</p><p>If the old ghost orders him to test dangerous areas in the heritage, facing unpredictable and ever-changing restrictions, even with the Illusion Divine Note, Qin Sang wouldn't dare to guarantee that he can always be this lucky.</p><p>At that time, I'm afraid it would be a luxury just to keep his body intact.</p><p>After thinking about this, Qin Sang thought about ways to escape all the time. Now he has only this one chance left, and he must seize it!</p><p>After initiating the Illusion Divine Note, Qin Sang immediately combined with his sword, without any hesitation flew towards the edge of the magma lake. He was not far from the edge of the magma lake, quickly broke out of the encirclement of the monkey horde, and flew straight towards the stone steps.</p><p>While flying, Qin Sang glanced at the magma lake.</p><p>The Old Man of Di Que has already sneaked to the front of the Scarlet Gold Vine. With a steady hand, he grabbed the fruit and gently used some strength, when the fruit suddenly disappeared out of thin air, and he had collected it.</p><p>The moment the fruit was picked, the Scarlet Gold Vine suddenly withered and then quickly shrank, turning into a dead vine, and finally dissipated into ashes.</p><p>At the root of the Scarlet Gold Vine, it seems that a section of fibrous roots still remains.</p><p>Perhaps over time, the Scarlet Gold Vine will grow again, but it will be difficult to wait for it to bear fruit again in a short time.</p><p>The growth cycle of this kind of heavenly spiritual fruit is very long, not as short as the Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid; it would also take hundreds of years.</p>
