<h1>Chapter 2160: A Promise</h1><p>Qin Sang saw four figures struggling within the rosy light. Two of them were completely enveloped in white light, their pristine white wings clearly visible even amidst the multicolored radiance. Spotless and emanating a holy aura, they resembled celestial beings – true members of the Feathered Race.</p><p>Within the Feathered Race, status was determined not only by cultivation level but also by the color of their wings.</p><p>Those born with holy white wings were considered the closest to the Heavenly Deities. Their wings were called Sacred Wings, while others possessed Mortal Wings.  The Feathered Race proclaimed themselves descendants of the Heavenly Deities, thus these Sacred Winged individuals held the highest status within their clan.</p><p>Wings of other colors signified mixed bloodlines. Legend had it that in ancient times, beneath the Sacred Wings, further distinctions were made based on wing color. However, due to practical factors like cultivation level and family background, over the years, these distinctions had blurred.  Apart from the Sacred Winged, there was no clear hierarchy of nobility.</p><p>This division was not baseless.  It was said that the Sacred Winged, though smallest in number, comprised more than half of the top experts.</p><p>The lowest in status were the vassal tribes of the Feathered Race. These tribes also mostly possessed wings, some bearing little difference from the Feathered Race. Frequent intermarriage led to mixed bloodlines, so some collectively referred to the Feathered Race and their vassals as the Feathered or Winged Tribes.</p><p>Among the four figures, two were Sacred Winged, while the other two were either Mortal Winged or vassal tribe experts.</p><p>Their figures bobbed within the rosy light. However, most members of the Feathered Race and their vassals were innately gifted in遁行, excelling in the art of flight and teleportation.</p><p>Caught between the rosy light and the Misty River's opposing forces, they appeared distressed, but in reality, they were able to leverage these forces and were not in mortal danger.</p><p>All four possessed extremely high cultivation. Qin Sang vaguely sensed that one of them was slightly weaker, similar to himself, while the other three were likely peak-level experts of the Void Refinement Stage. No wonder they dared to snatch treasures from the jaws of a tiger!</p><p>The eruption of the rosy light, leading to the sudden encounter, was unforeseen by everyone.</p><p>In the contest for opportunities, it was a fight to the death. Even if both sides belonged to the Celestial Division, they couldn't afford to show mercy.</p><p>Fury burned in Si Huang's eyes. The other side had also spotted their group, their returning gazes defiant. Even before the real fight began, Qin Sang could already sense the tension.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>Two pale white flames shot out from behind Si Huang.  These flames surged forward like two fiery spears, aimed at the opponents and launched with fierce speed.  Simultaneously, Si Huang advanced instead of retreating, charging head-on against the impact of the rosy light.</p><p>The outer ancient formations had been broken by the Si You Royal Family, and further disrupted by the rosy light's impact, rendering the path ahead almost unobstructed.</p><p>The Grand Tutor, the First Prince, and the others followed without hesitation.</p><p>Bound by the previous agreement, with no immediate threat to his life, Qin Sang had no reason to retreat. He could only follow, maintaining a heightened sense of vigilance.</p><p>In an instant, they passed through the fissure and effortlessly traversed the third ancient formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  With the eruption of the rosy light, the forces within the Misty River had also changed, but whether this change was beneficial or detrimental remained unknown.  It was impossible to advise Si Huang to stop and observe now.</p><p>"The guardian beasts are gone."</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang heard Si Huang's voice transmission. It was calm, unlike his outward display of anger.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze. Si Huang was referring to the heart of the secret realm, the source of the rosy light. Originally, that area housed not only dangerous ancient formations but also mysterious guardian beasts that attacked all intruders.</p><p>These powerful guardian beasts were seemingly endless.  The Si You Royal Family had tried various methods, but couldn't eliminate them completely.  Once anyone entered a certain range, the guardian beasts would suddenly appear and launch a frenzied attack.</p><p>The guardian beasts were one of the greatest obstacles. Breaking through the formations while defending against their relentless assaults was incredibly difficult.  Even Si Huang, who had gleaned some patterns, wasn't completely confident.</p><p>Yet, at this moment, the guardian beasts had vanished.</p><p>The Feathered Race experts had already stepped into the guardian beasts' attack range.  If the beasts were still present, the opponents would be in an even more precarious situation under these circumstances.</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized the rosy light, searching for traces of the guardian beasts.  Suddenly, he sensed something amiss and turned his gaze forward.</p><p>Wisps of subtle grayish-white energy materialized in the void.  At first, Qin Sang assumed they were a result of the collision between the rosy light and the Misty River, but he quickly realized something was wrong.</p><p>The source of the grayish-white energy was unknown. It didn't originate from the Misty River, appearing as if out of thin air and converging before him.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He pointed ahead and said gravely, "Could these be the guardian beasts?"</p><p>The grayish-white energy transformed rapidly, coalescing into a mass before Qin Sang in an instant.  Not only Qin Sang but Si Huang and the others also found similar grayish-white masses forming in front of them.</p><p>Next, these masses stretched and contorted, astonishingly sprouting heads and limbs, morphing into grayish-white humanoid figures that emitted eerie chuckles.</p><p>"They're not the guardian beasts! Something's wrong. Everyone be careful!" Si Huang said solemnly.</p><p>Before his voice faded, these grayish-white figures continued their transformation.  Shockingly, they began to mimic those standing before them, ultimately taking on their exact appearances.</p><p>Body, features, attire, even the circular beads on the foreheads of the Si You clan were replicated. Then, they blinked their eyes, twitched their mouths, flawlessly imitating everyone's expressions.</p><p>The only difference was their bodies remained grayish-white, like faded versions of themselves.</p><p>"Hee hee..."</p><p>The grayish-white figures giggled cheerfully, a sound that sent shivers down everyone's spines.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>Qin Sang faintly sensed a gentle breeze as the grayish-white figure that had transformed into him suddenly approached, like a phantom.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>Instinctively, Qin Sang activated the Gray Warbler Sword, a sword beam piercing through the grayish-white figure's forehead.</p><p>The figure stiffened, its body splitting in two from its forehead, collapsing and melting into grayish-white energy, seemingly about to be dispersed by the surrounding forces.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was slightly surprised. The grayish-white figure was more fragile than he'd anticipated.</p><p>However, things weren't that simple.</p><p>The mass of grayish-white energy reignited, instantly reforming into Qin Sang's likeness, then mimicking Qin Sang's previous action with a wave of its sleeve.</p><p>A sword beam shot towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. If this sword beam was a perfect imitation of his own, its power was no less potent. He had immersed himself in the way of the sword for many years. That strike hadn't employed any specific technique, yet it felt flawlessly natural. How could the grayish-white figure achieve this?</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>A thought flashed through his mind. Qin Sang activated the Gray Warbler Sword once more, executing a simple sword technique.</p><p>A sword shadow, light as a feather, slowly met the incoming sword beam. Appearing slow but deceptively fast, it suddenly split into two – one blocking the sword beam, the other abruptly appearing before the grayish-white figure's chest and abdomen.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>The grayish-white figure was cut in half, reforming before fully dissipating into grayish-white energy.</p><p>Others faced similar situations, with the First Prince faring the worst.  He initially attempted to crush the grayish-white figure with overwhelming force.  After its resurrection, he was caught off guard and nearly injured by his own attack.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Grand Tutor exchanged glances, guessing why the great beast had gone berserk and migrated.</p><p>The grayish-white figures were likely spawned by the rosy light.</p><p>Not only had the rosy light destroyed its lair, but it had also given rise to this eerie grayish-white energy, spontaneously creating an unkillable enemy.  The great beast, unfamiliar with probing attacks, always struck with its full might.  Perhaps after a few exchanges, the grayish-white figure's power would rival its own.</p><p>No wonder the great beast's lair resembled a battlefield yet only contained its own aura.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang also realized that after leaving the great beast's lair, the traces of battle vanished, suggesting that the grayish-white figures weren't truly immortal.</p><p>There was another possibility.  Leaving the rosy light's range or waiting for it to dissipate might cause the grayish-white figures to vanish automatically.</p><p>However, retreating now meant surrendering the treasure, a move Si Huang wouldn't make easily.</p><p>Thoughts flashed like lightning as the grayish-white figure attacked again, executing the very sword technique Qin Sang had used just moments ago.  To Qin Sang's eyes, it was near perfect!</p><p>The grayish-white figure was like a diligent student, its learning ability terrifying, even capable of mimicking the abilities of spiritual treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang changed tactics, employing a sword technique designed for entrapment. The sword light transformed into a cage, imprisoning the grayish-white figure.</p><p>Unfortunately, his plan didn't work. The grayish-white figure simply dispersed into grayish-white energy within the cage, reforming outside and even using the same technique against him. This confirmed that the figure never truly died.</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily at a loss.  To prevent the grayish-white figure's power from growing too rapidly, the best approach was to keep it occupied, but only under ideal conditions without external interference.</p><p>If a dangerous situation arose, forcing him to unleash his full strength, he would subsequently face a copy of himself at peak condition, fearless of injury and death! Furthermore, their understanding of the grayish-white figures was limited. They didn't know if they possessed other abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang was thankful he hadn't used his thunder escape or the Great Vajra Wheel Seal; otherwise, things would be even more troublesome.  Meanwhile, the Grand Tutor and others, to resist the Misty River's force, had used techniques and spiritual treasures that were now mimicked by the grayish-white figures, making them increasingly formidable in both offense and defense.</p><p>"Husband, what do we do now?" An Ling Fei asked anxiously.</p><p>With the rosy light ahead, the Misty River behind, and the entanglement of the grayish-white figures, they had no energy left to seize the treasure.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang and the Grand Tutor shared their deductions.</p><p>Si Huang observed their opponents, seeing that they too were plagued by the grayish-white figures.  He declared decisively, "We wait and see!"</p><p>Just as they decided to stay put and cautiously engage the grayish-white figures, another change occurred.</p><p>"Rumble..."</p><p>"Splash!"</p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p><p>The rosy light seemed to have enraged the Misty River.  The two powerful forces erupted in a shocking maelstrom, their residual power sweeping across the area. The four Feathered Race experts, unable to withstand the pressure, were forced to retreat from the heart of the secret realm, seeking refuge.</p><p>Qin Sang's group couldn't remain stationary either.  The weakest among them were the first to feel the strain as the impact arrived.</p><p>A peculiar scene unfolded: their opponents were retreating, and so were they, both sides deliberately avoiding direct conflict.</p><p>The difference in strength became apparent. The weakest cultivator among the four Feathered Race experts gradually fell behind.</p><p>On Qin Sang's side, Si Huang and the Grand Tutor were undoubtedly the strongest.</p><p>An Ling Fei and the First Prince had similar cultivation levels.  They retreated the fastest and farthest, followed by the Chao Protector. Qin Sang's cultivation was inferior to the Chao Protector, but his strength rivaled a late Void Refinement cultivator.  If he went all out, he could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Si Huang and the Grand Tutor.</p><p>But he wouldn't do that. Maintaining a pace similar to the Chao Protector, he focused on dealing with the grayish-white figure.</p><p>He devised a strategy and summoned the Bright Mountain Armor.</p><p>As expected, an identical armor materialized on the grayish-white figure, making it even harder to kill. Qin Sang didn't mind, focusing solely on defense, avoiding "teaching" it any offensive techniques.</p><p>Tremors and loud rumbles continued to emanate from the depths of the rosy light. Sections of broken walls and rubble were ejected, painting a picture of a devastated secret realm.</p><p>Just then, Si Huang's expression suddenly changed.</p><p>A white pillar of light erupted from the depths of the rosy light. This white light clearly didn't belong to the rosy light, and in the instant it appeared, the surrounding chaos seemed to momentarily subside.</p><p>At this moment, everyone saw a great formation beneath the white light, its crisscrossing white beams protecting the area.  Below the beams stood a cluster of ancient and elegant pavilions.</p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p><p>Several white beams shattered in the violent collisions, yet the formation held firm.</p><p>Everyone sensed that the formation's power wasn't solely derived from the heart of the secret realm. The outer formations, previously breached by the Si You Royal Family and impacted by the rosy light, now emanated a renewed power.  Clearly, there were secrets the Si You Royal Family hadn't yet deciphered.</p><p>The formation displayed its true might, but the white beams continued to peel away, its power gradually waning.</p><p>Si Huang fixated his gaze on an ancient pavilion at the center of the cluster, towering above the others.  A faint, ethereal light emanated from its surface, and ancient restrictions sealed it.</p><p>"Immortal Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang heard Si Huang's voice transmission.</p><p>"If the rosy light dissipates and the grayish-white figures vanish as you and the Grand Tutor suspect, I implore you to help us breach that ancient pavilion!"</p><p>"This..." Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>The inherent danger was apparent to all.</p><p>The Feathered Race experts clearly had their eyes on the same pavilion. If he intervened, he would inevitably face their combined assault, with the added uncertainty of further changes within the rosy light and the secret realm itself.</p><p>When making the oath, Qin Sang had been wary of Si Huang pushing him into a suicidal situation.  Under these circumstances, he could choose to remain a passive observer.</p><p>"The Feathered Race are unaware of the grayish-white figures' disappearance pattern. Even a moment's hesitation on their part will be our opportunity!  The Grand Tutor and I will do our utmost to hold them back, buying you time.  They don't know your true strength and won't be overly cautious.  You only need to approach swiftly, unleash the Thunder Pearl at the pavilion, then immediately retreat.  I will personally seize the treasure within. They'll be focused on stopping me, not pursuing you. Of course, if the situation permits, I hope you can alleviate some of the pressure."</p><p>In a split second, Si Huang had weighed the pros and cons.  The only challenge was persuading Qin Sang.</p><p>Si Huang hadn't anticipated this turn of events before entering.  Now, he could only make impromptu promises.</p><p>"The Thunder Pearl was obtained from another secret realm. Alongside it were several other treasures that might hold secrets related to the Thunder Pearl.  Your expertise in thunder arts may find them useful. Regardless of the outcome, I will gift them to you."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, unmoved. He asked, "What exactly is inside the pavilion?"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Spending time with family tomorrow for the holiday, taking a day off. Will resume updates the day after tomorrow. Happy holidays, everyone. </p>
