Chapter 253: Painting Using Air

The Hidden Moth in the old man's palm flapped its wings gently, its tiny wings fluttering as it created a cloud of fine grey dust that transformed into a painting in mid-air.

The painting depicted a scene in which a man passed the rock the moth was perched on and began to climb the mountain. The man's features were etched delicately and vividly, and he was unmistakable – Che Yutao!

"The one climbing the mountain is that old wretch Che..."

The old man withdrew the Hidden Moth and muttered.

He looked up at the mist-shrouded mountaintop, but refrained from climbing further. Instead, he used his spiritual power to carry Qin Sang and Ren Hong, left this peak and silently flew towards another celestial peak.

After approaching these four celestial peaks, the old man had strictly forbade Qin Sang and Ren Hong from acting rashly or they would be killed on the spot!

Qin Sang could sense that the old man was not joking.

As the old man carried them, Qin Sang's mind was racing. From the moment he first saw Sikong Muyue to the celestial peak, he had noticed that the old man had been unusually cautious, as if he were secretly planning something no one knew about.

Seeing the Hidden Moth and the scenes it had captured with its scales, Qin Sang had an inkling of what it might be.

He did not know when the old man had left the Hidden Moth here, but it had only one purpose: to act as an earpiece and spy on those who passed through this location.

Out of the five Nascent Soul cultivators who had entered the ruins, only the five of them had the ability to break through the restrictions and ascend the celestial peak – the others did not dare to risk it.

The old man himself aside, there were four others. Was he targeting one of them?

Sikong Muyue had not entered the mountain, so that left three others.

The one who had ascended this peak was Che Yutao, but it did not seem as if he was the old man’s target, which left Grandmaster Xuanyu of the Shangyuan Pure Palace and Sect Master Dui Yi of the Qingluo Sect.

Qin Sang did not know who the old man was targeting, nor what his purpose was.

Of course, it was also possible that the old man had no sinister intentions and was merely trying to select a peak that had not been touched, to avoid conflict with the others.

But Qin Sang did not believe that.

Soon, the trio silently arrived in front of the second celestial peak. The old man retrieved another Hidden Moth from a cliff, and this one transformed into the image of... Sikong Muyue! Only she was not climbing up, but down!

"How could she be so fast?"

The old man frowned deeply in surprise. He abruptly turned to the two of them and asked, "How long did it take you two to pass the trials? Who has seen Sikong Muyue? And who was she with?"

Ren Hong replied, "Senior Sikong suddenly appeared and rallied us to work together to break the ban. It was the first time I was meeting her, but at the time I was concentrating on breaking through the second layer of the restrictions, and I remember that Senior Sikong seemed to be alone."

Seeing the old man's gaze shift onto him, Qin Sang answered, "Junior's cultivation base is low, so I definitely entered after Fellow Daoist Ren. Also, I wasted some time in the north of the ruins before coming here, so I did not see Senior Sikong previously."

The old man looked away, hesitated for a while, and led Qin Sang and Ren Hong away from this peak, towards the third celestial peak.

The Hidden Moth concealed on the third celestial peak transformed into the image of... Grandmaster Xuanyu of the Shangyuan Pure Palace!

The grandmaster was lean, with a refined air and a demeanor of a master of the Tao. He walked up the mountain, looking around himself with an alert gaze and raising one hand. He formed a sword with his index and middle finger and pointed it at something in the air, though it was unclear what he intended to do.

At the sight of Grandmaster Xuanyu, the old man suddenly laughed heartily, and the gloom on his face vanished. He put away the moth, pondered for a while, then disappeared in a flash, arriving silently at the place Grandmaster Xuanyu had pointed at.

He jabbed the top of his staff forward, and spiritual power emanated from it, transforming into the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound. The sound waves gently spread outwards. Moments later, a faint blue light flashed in the void where the sound waves had passed.

The blue light came from a spirit talisman – this talisman was completely different from the spirit talismans that Qin Sang had seen before. It was not drawn on a piece of talisman paper, but was instead ethereal, as if its patterns were imprinted on the void itself.

The lines were intricate and hovered in the air, radiating an ethereal glow.

Qin Sang had never seen such a talisman, but he had heard about it from Teng Nan.

The Shangyuan Pure Palace was renowned for its mastery of the way of talismans, not only possessing the Four Great Mysterious Talismans, which were renowned for their mysterious and magnificent power, but also for its profound and unique methods of drawing and creating talismans. Of these, the art of drawing talismans in mid-air using spiritual power was one of the most advanced techniques.

Only someone who had profound attainments in the way of talismans could accomplish this. Even in the Shangyuan Pure Palace, there were not many who could do so.

Grandmaster Xuanyu was evidently one of them.

The old man had used the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound to force the spirit talisman out of hiding. Qin Sang could sense from the fluctuations that emanated from the spirit talisman that it was a warning talisman.

Grandmaster Xuanyu had probably left it here as a precaution, to prevent anyone from following him. If anyone passed through this location and triggered the talisman, he would be alerted immediately. It was unfortunate, however, that it had been seen by the Hidden Moth.

"Seal!"

Old Man Dique clasped his hands together, and the Thousand Illusions Divine Tune's power immediately gathered to the spirit talisman. Before the spirit talisman could shatter, it tightly sealed the talisman, which once again turned into nothingness and dissipated.

Seeing this scene, Qin Sang and Ren Hong exchanged a glance. Their eyes revealed the same concern.

If they still did not understand what Old Man Dique intended to do, then they would be foolish! They were Foundation Establishment cultivators who had been schemed against by another Foundation Establishment. If they were dragged into this, what would become of them?

After sealing the spirit talisman, Old Man Dique turned to look at them with a sinister smile. Without offering an explanation, his spiritual power wrapped around them and flew them to a crevice between rocks, where he set up a concealed restriction. "This elder needs to heal. Since you've taken this elder's benefits, you should do your work properly and not think too much. This elder is alone and without disciples. If you follow this elder, you will receive many more benefits in the future."

Qin Sang remained unmoved by Old Man Dique's hinted suggestion.

However, Ren Hong's expression wavered slightly.

Although he was a disciple of the Wind and Thunder Sect, he was limited by his talent. The sect's Golden Core cultivators did not give him any attention. When there were any good opportunities, they would let those disciples with outstanding talent pick first. He would not necessarily get any of what was left over.

When Ren Hong thought back on that period of time in the sect, he felt resentment.

In the end, he was forced to come to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to fight for a chance, living like a casual cultivator. Although he had indeed encountered several fortuitous opportunities and cultivated some strength, only he knew the bitterness involved.

If he could become a Golden Core cultivator's disciple...

Ren Hong bowed and respectfully said, "This junior understands."

Qin Sang echoed him, and the corner of his eye swept across Ren Hong before he retracted his gaze. Everyone had their own thoughts. What Ren Hong chose was none of his concern.

Looking after himself was enough!

Old Man Dique sat down cross-legged, took out a spirit pill, and swallowed it. After the medicinal power dissolved, his old face abruptly flushed, and he suddenly vomited a mouthful of foul blood.

The foul blood was pure black like ink. It was extinguished by the Thousand Illusions Divine Tune.

After vomiting the foul blood, Old Man Dique's complexion improved a lot.

Qin Sang's eyes flashed. It seemed that when Old Man Dique broke out of the Divine Ape's encirclement, he was hit by the Divine Ape's Fire Staff. It was not as easy as it looked on the surface. The injuries on his body were probably not minor. It was unknown how much this spirit pill could heal.
