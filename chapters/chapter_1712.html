<h1>Chapter 1703: Breakthrough</h1><p>Two years later.</p><p>The Avatar, sensing the cave's protective formation being triggered, awoke from his meditative trance and welcomed Venerable Huiguang and the Azure Fox Saint King into his chamber.  During this time, the Azure Fox Saint King had journeyed to Jingkong Island in the East Sea to relocate an ancient Spirit Gathering Formation, and to gather the spirit herbs and materials requested by the Avatar from the妖族(Demon Race), only now returning.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom…’</p><p>The ground trembled.</p><p>Several streaks of light flew from the Azure Fox Saint King's fingertips, landing on the ground and transforming into four ten-meter-tall sculptures. They were the statues of the Four Sacred Beasts: the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, and the Black Tortoise.</p><p>“The Four Sacred Beast statues are part of the Spirit Gathering Formation. This King also calls it the Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation. This is the core formation disc.”</p><p>With another flick of his wrist, the Azure Fox Saint King sent a Bagua-shaped formation disc flying towards the Avatar.  The disc shimmered with silver light, only the size of a normal compass. The Avatar reached out and caught it, feeling its surprising weight, unsure of what material it was made from. Many lines crisscrossed the disc, not orderly runes, but a dense network of cracks, a truly sorry sight.</p><p>Even though the Azure Fox Saint King had warned him beforehand, upon seeing the state of the formation disc, the Avatar's movements subconsciously became more gentle, for fear of breaking it.  Looking at the Four Sacred Beast statues, they were only slightly better than the disc. He couldn't help but look at the Azure Fox Saint King with a skeptical gaze.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King spoke in a languid tone, “Since you've cultivated to the late Nascent Soul stage, you can't be completely ignorant of Formation Dao. Try it, and you'll know this King speaks the truth. It's more than enough to support your cultivation. Of course, if you can comprehend the true Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation from these formation tools, even this King would envy such an opportunity.”</p><p>The Avatar could sense the mockery in his tone.  It seemed the Azure Fox Saint King was confident that he couldn't comprehend the true Spirit Gathering Formation. If it were that easy, it wouldn't be so valuable.</p><p>“Please wait a moment…”</p><p>The Avatar rose, beckoned, and the four statues shrunk, landing in his palm. He then carried them into his inner chamber.</p><p>Inside, following the Azure Fox Saint King’s instructions, the Avatar arranged the four statues and the formation disc, meticulously aligning them with the directions corresponding to the Four Sacred Beasts.</p><p>He also set up the Myriad Miles Azure Sky Formation provided by Venerable Huiguang.  The Sweet Dew Chan Monastery had fully cooperated, refining all the necessary formation tools for the Myriad Miles Azure Sky Formation well in advance.</p><p>Both formations were set up in the Avatar's cave.</p><p>As soon as the Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation was complete, the four statues vanished.  Then, images of the Four Sacred Beasts appeared on the four sides of the formation disc, their heads all pointing towards the center, mouths slightly open, as if inhaling and exhaling towards the center.</p><p>The Avatar felt the spiritual energy within the cave suddenly surge. Spiritual energy from all directions converged above the Spirit Gathering Formation, as if drawn by an invisible vortex.</p><p>In his cultivation journey so far, besides the legends related to a few Immortal Halls, this formation was the strongest Spirit Gathering Formation Qin Sang had ever witnessed!</p><p>Stepping into the formation, the Avatar silently circulated his spiritual energy for a full cycle, instantly feeling refreshed. Cultivation felt easier than before. If he weren't bottlenecked, the sensation would be even more pronounced.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King's previous description hadn't been exaggerated. With this assistance, his main body would surely be greatly empowered.</p><p>“The Four Sacred Beast statues… My main body possesses the Southern Bright Emberfire. Could I use this to probe the secrets of this formation…” The Avatar pondered, gazing at the Vermilion Bird image beside him.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't sense any familiar aura. The presence of the Four Sacred Beast statues didn't necessarily mean they were related to the actual Four Sacred Beasts. It might be a deception employed by the formation's creator.</p><p>Next, the Avatar set up the Myriad Miles Azure Sky Formation and formed hand seals, striking the spiritual formation.</p><p>A gust of wind arose.</p><p>A cyan spiritual wind was born within the formation, swirling briefly before the Avatar and rushing upwards.  Upon reaching the ceiling of the cave, it abruptly dissipated without a trace.</p><p>Simultaneously.</p><p>In the Deer Wilderness, Qin Sang's main body heard a clear ringing.</p><p>On one side of his cave, a formation of Azure Bells was arranged, composed of a dozen fist-sized cyan bells. It was used to communicate with the Myriad Miles Azure Sky Formation. The cost of refining the Azure Bells was far less than the main body of the Myriad Miles Azure Sky Formation.</p><p>The ringing indicated that his Avatar had results.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted. He used a spell, and the ringing became more urgent. A cyan spiritual wind gathered within the bell formation, faintly revealing a human-shaped silhouette.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The Avatar emerged from the inner chamber. Venerable Huiguang and the Azure Fox Saint King were still waiting outside, showing no signs of impatience.</p><p>The Avatar produced two newly inscribed jade slips.  "These are the Soul Stabilizing Incense formula and the Formless Immortal Sect's Dao of Alchemy inheritance. I've already arranged for people to deliver the Myriad Spirit Fruit and other spirit herbs soon…"</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King took the jade slips, left behind the spirit herbs and materials the Avatar needed, and rose to leave, saying only, "This King will verify them later."</p><p>“Amitabha, how wonderful, how wonderful! For the two benefactors to transform conflict into jade and silk is truly fortunate for both races! Fortunate for all beings!”  Venerable Huiguang beamed with joy, then stood up. "This poor monk will not disturb your secluded cultivation."</p><p>"Please, Venerable One."</p><p>After seeing off the two Nascent Soul cultivators, the Avatar returned to his cave, stored away the various treasures, sat cross-legged, and brought his palms together.  Cold煞 energy(Sha energy) emanated from his palms, gathering between them into a white mass.  The chill was contained within this small space, not dissipating at all.</p><p>The Avatar was comprehending the Cold Sha energy to assault his late Nascent Soul bottleneck!</p><p>At this time, the *Demonic Illumination Scripture* was transmitted to his main body via the Myriad Miles Azure Sky Formation.  The Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation and other physical objects were not convenient to send back yet, so he continued to wait for the right opportunity.</p><p>Deer Wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body placed his hands on his knees, holding a jade slip containing the complete *Demonic Illumination Scripture*. He had already read it dozens of times and was now comprehending it word by word.</p><p>Compared to *Hundred-Layered Yin Thunder* and other Nascent Soul level Dao techniques, this scripture wasn't overly complex. Even though Qin Sang hadn't reached the required realm, he could still understand its key points.</p><p>These key points were also the most dangerous aspects of the scripture. They involved actively setting up an altar and casting spells, actively approaching Heavenly Demons to draw a sliver of demonic nature, also known as demonic intent, into the body. Of course, not the Heavenly Demon itself.</p><p>Judging from the text, he couldn't determine the scripture's origin. Qin Sang felt it resembled a demonic sect's technique, similar to those techniques that drove cultivators into a frenzy of emotions and desires.</p><p>Even if it only involved drawing in demonic intent, it still had extremely high requirements for the cultivator.</p><p>First, one must have a sufficiently firm mind, or risk being swayed by the Heavenly Demon's demonic intent, triggering inner demons.</p><p>Second, one's divine sense must be strong enough to complete the entire ritual of the spell.  This was even more important than mental fortitude, as the ritual consumed a vast amount of divine sense. At the end of the ritual, upon drawing in the demonic intent, one must immediately sever the connection.  The slightest hesitation would truly attract the attention of a Heavenly Demon, leading to utter destruction.</p><p>After completing the ritual, the cultivator would constantly be accompanied by demonic intent, using it to temper themselves, but also constantly at risk of being consumed by it.</p><p>According to the scripture, a minimum of Nascent Soul level divine sense was required, and spiritual cultivators were preferred.</p><p>Someone like him, at the Nascent Soul realm but with the opportunity to elevate his divine sense to the Nascent Soul level through various fortuitous encounters, had to be extremely cautious.</p><p>Possessing the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang's pressure was considerably lessened.</p><p>He still remembered the soul-attacking secret technique the Demon Monarch used in the Seven Kills Palace, instantly injuring everyone present, yet easily blocked by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't compare the strength of an Outer Domain Heavenly Demon to the Demon Monarch.</p><p>Furthermore, this scripture came from a fox demon who harbored ill will towards him, so even more caution was necessary.</p><p>Time was meaningless within the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't remember how many times he'd studied it, but he could be certain that the Azure Fox Saint King hadn't tampered with the text.  Every sentence was concise and to the point, its profoundness no less than the scriptures from the Immortal Halls. Adding or altering a single word would make it feel disjointed. The creator of this scripture was definitely no ordinary being.</p><p>Caution was still paramount.  The Jade Buddha could only protect his primordial spirit, and no one knew if Outer Domain Heavenly Demons possessed other strange and mysterious methods besides manipulating inner demons to kill.</p><p>Setting up the altar and casting the spells needed to be done after refining the origin of the demonic fire. He also had to wait for his Avatar's return to prepare a backup plan.</p><p>If others made a mistake during the spellcasting, they would have no means of response, instantly overwhelmed by inner demons, with no hope of survival. Qin Sang was different. The Jade Buddha would ensure the clarity of his spiritual platform. No matter how powerful the Heavenly Demon, it should buy him time to react.</p><p>If an insurmountable problem arose, his Avatar would instantly replace his main body, then sever the connection with the Avatar, sacrificing a pawn to save the king.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure if using an Outer Domain Heavenly Demon to replace his inner demons to condense a Demonic Seal would work.</p><p>But considering Senior Sister Qing Jun’s description of the *Lifeless Demonic Seal*, it was worth a try.</p><p>Just like what Qin Sang was doing now.</p><p>Failure meant sacrificing an Avatar.</p><p>Success meant obtaining a Nascent Soul level mystic art. Outer Domain Heavenly Demons could bewitch Void Refinement cultivators, and using their demonic intent to form a seal should be more powerful than using inner demons.</p><p>His goal remained unchanged.  Breaking through his current realm was his top priority, and for this, he would spare no effort.  Even his Avatar was expendable.</p><p>...</p><p>Daoist Qing Feng appeared at the Sweet Dew Chan Monastery, and the commotion didn't last long. The attention of the cultivation world was quickly drawn to other matters.</p><p>The most talked about event was the joint effort by the two Nascent Soul cultivators, leading experts from both the human and demon races to set up defenses in the storm belts north, east, and south of the Central Continent, preparing to hunt down the ferocious beasts. The western part of the Central Continent was a land of lava and raging flames, where ferocious beasts were unlikely to appear.</p><p>To this day, news of the ferocious beasts’ rampage had spread throughout the cultivation world, reaching even many Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>After the initial panic, people gradually calmed down because news of the ferocious beasts became less frequent. They no longer appeared in hordes, and it had been decades since the last time ferocious beasts passed through the Central Continent.</p><p>After so many years, apart from the sudden appearance of ferocious beasts, nothing else had changed, and the barrier against the storms showed no signs of weakening.</p><p>Only those who knew the truth worried that something had changed within the ferocious beasts' lair, affecting the path of ascension.  That was why the two Nascent Soul cultivators from both races called for action, and their call was met with a resounding response.</p><p>The human and demon races, various sects and schools, were united in a rare display of solidarity. Top experts were dispatched to patrol the storm belts in rotation, ready to report any sighting of ferocious beasts.</p><p>Fifteen years passed in a flash.</p><p>Sweet Dew Chan Monastery.</p><p>Cracking sounds continuously echoed from the Avatar’s cave.</p><p>If anyone entered the cave at this moment, they would be astonished. The cave was frigid, transformed into an ice cave. Thick icicles clung to the walls, and a white, cold air flowed continuously. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator could be injured by the cold if careless.</p><p>The cold air constantly swirled around a meditating figure, the Avatar.</p><p>The Avatar was covered in a layer of frost, as if frozen stiff.  He inhaled and exhaled the surrounding cold air. As time went on, the cold air grew denser.  The entire cave became a world of white.</p><p>Suddenly, the cold air stopped flowing. Time in the cave seemed to freeze as well.  After a hundred breaths, it shifted from extreme stillness to extreme motion. The cold air visibly condensed into several streams, frantically converging inwards, ultimately gathering above the Avatar's crown and pouring into his body!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Avatar’s body trembled violently, and a thunderous roar echoed within him.</p><p>On the other side of the mountain, a meditating monk in his cave suddenly opened his eyes. He appeared on the mountaintop in a flash, gazing towards the Avatar's cave, rapidly rolling prayer beads in his hand.</p><p>A long howl echoed through the air.  The spiritual energy in the mountains seemed to be drawn by some force, converging madly towards the Avatar’s cave, causing the mountain to tremble.</p><p>The unusual phenomenon lasted for a long time before dissipating.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>Light and shadow flickered before the monk, revealing a figure, the Avatar.</p><p>However, the Avatar's aura had drastically changed. He was now in the late Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>"I have disturbed your serene cultivation, Venerable One." The Avatar bowed.</p><p>“How wonderful! Congratulations, Daoist, on grasping the profound mysteries!” The monk returned the greeting with a palms-together bow.</p><p>The Avatar smiled. He hadn’t expected it to be so smooth.  His Avatar succeeded in its first attempt at breaking through. It seemed his main body's insights also benefited his Avatar.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang's previous approach, the Avatar didn't continue to seclude himself after the breakthrough. After stabilizing his cultivation, he appeared publicly. The news of Daoist Qing Feng's breakthrough to the late Nascent Soul stage quickly spread throughout the cultivation world. Many said he was destined to become a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, lamenting his affiliation with the Buddhist sect.</p><p>Since Daoist Qing Feng resided in the Sweet Dew Chan Monastery, he was difficult for ordinary people to meet, making the Xie Family and the Lookout Tower even more sought after.</p><p>When a sect member broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage, a celebration was mandatory in the North Sea, but optional in the Central Continent.</p><p>When Master Xingji came to offer congratulations, perhaps out of courtesy, he mentioned it. Unexpectedly, the Avatar didn’t refuse at all and readily agreed, letting the Sweet Dew Chan Monastery handle the arrangements.</p><p>Thus, a peculiar sight appeared in the cultivation world. Before this, no one had ever heard of a celebration being held at another sect’s grounds.</p><p>The celebration was packed with distinguished guests.</p><p>The Sweet Dew Chan Monastery managed everything perfectly. Xie An and the others busied themselves with various tasks, each filled with pride.</p><p>At the celebration, Sect Master Situ Yu of Mount Bunian personally delivered congratulatory gifts and mentioned that Lu Zhang had completed his cultivation and was attempting a breakthrough.  The Avatar naturally offered his congratulations.</p><p>The new Sect Master He Gao of the Eight Scenery Pavilion also came to congratulate him.</p><p>The Avatar also met the renowned Sect Master Yu of the Skyhawk Tower, as well as high-ranking members from top sects like the Dragon Abode Heavenly Grotto and the瓊影門(Jade Shadow Sect), becoming acquainted with heroes from all corners of the world.</p><p>The Sweet Dew Chan Monastery didn’t seem to lose out either.  They had other arrangements. These people greeted the Avatar briefly before going to visit Venerable Huiguang, discussing something unknown.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that the Avatar encountered the Poison King again at the celebration.</p><p>As expected, the Poison King brought up the matter of the Gu King again.  The Avatar tried to extract the Gu King's origins from the Poison King without success, and stated directly, "Fellow Daoist should understand my situation. Even if I'm willing to trade, I dare not show myself. Once my cultivation improves, I will visit you personally."</p><p>…</p><p>After the breakthrough, Qin Sang wasn’t in a hurry to further increase his Avatar's cultivation.</p><p>The Avatar didn't continue to seclude himself.  He studied the *Four Symbols Serpent Seal*, while also browsing the scriptures in the Sweet Dew Chan Monastery's Scripture Pavilion, reaping considerable rewards.</p><p>In addition, the Avatar began to study the Formless Immortal Sect's Dao of Alchemy inheritance.</p><p>Using secret techniques like Avatar or Divine Sense Splitting to concurrently study various external paths wasn't uncommon in the cultivation world, but the results were mostly unsatisfactory. After all, not everyone's Avatar was as independent as his, with a realm comparable to his main body, capable of comprehending sufficiently profound content.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators gathered master alchemists from the human race to analyze the Soul Stabilizing Incense formula for its refinement.  After learning of this, the Avatar contacted several of them.  These alchemists were tight-lipped about the Soul Stabilizing Incense, but didn't mind doing him a favor, offering their guidance without reservation. They were also invited by the Avatar to refine the spirit pills required by the Heavenly Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>…</p><p>Another six years passed.</p><p>Within the Deer Wilderness.</p><p>The Mani Pearl floated before the main body. The flames around the Wishing Pearl returned to red, interspersed with a few black threads.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
