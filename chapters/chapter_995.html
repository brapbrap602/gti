<h1>Chapter 987: The Plan</h1><p>Chapter 987: The Plan</p><p>“Since it’s a fire curse infused with Winter Nether Flame power, and Winter Nether Flame fears demonic fire, perhaps we can use this as a breakthrough point, using demonic fire…” Bai softly explained.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, not saying much. He had only recently learned about this curse, and couldn't think of a better solution.</p><p>The line of fire touched Qin Sang's arm, icy and chilling.</p><p>Bai warned Qin Sang to suppress the demonic fire, absolutely preventing its backlash, otherwise they would both be injured.</p><p>Qin Sang was very cautious, carefully activating the demonic banner.</p><p>Bai stared intently at the line of fire. After hesitating for a moment, he suddenly cast several hand seals at it. One line of fire began to twist, transforming into strange runes, with similar fluctuations to the fire curse runes.</p><p>A look of joy appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bai suddenly stopped, pondering for a while before resuming.</p><p>In this intermittent manner, the line of fire repeatedly twisted and deformed, transforming into countless runes, finally coalescing into a small, transparent demonic fire curse mark.</p><p>Immediately, Bai pointed towards Qin Sang's arm.</p><p>The demonic fire curse mark trembled, drifting over, but before it could touch Qin Sang's skin, it disintegrated.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang sighed inwardly, understanding Bai's earlier words.</p><p>Breaking the fire curse was not a matter of days; it was extremely difficult.</p><p>The extent of Bai's recovered memories was unknown, but those related to the curse were clearly hazy and incomplete, leaving them to grope for a solution bit by bit.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>Qin Sang looked behind him.</p><p>Dark clouds obscured the moon, hiding the starlight.</p><p>The edge of his vision was completely enveloped in darkness.</p><p>There, it seemed, a terrifying beast was in hot pursuit, its jaws agape, eagerly anticipating a delicious meal.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed his internal state and the remaining spiritual energy in his spirit stones. He had to prepare a medication plan, using the Three Lights Jade Liquid to minimize the impact of impurities and prolong his endurance.</p><p>Bai continued his various attempts.</p><p>Two hours passed, and it was deep into the night.</p><p>Despite repeated failures, Bai persisted; his pressure was no less than Qin Sang's.</p><p>At this point, the demonic fire curse mark he had condensed was several times more stable than before.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The demonic fire curse mark fell onto Qin Sang's arm again.</p><p>This time, the demonic fire curse mark didn't shatter immediately.</p><p>Bai was overjoyed at the sight, his hand seals changing rapidly.  The demonic fire curse mark became ethereal, slowly merging into Qin Sang's arm. A faint, peculiar fluctuation then appeared within Qin Sang's body.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed the true energy in his meridians to avoid interfering with Bai's actions.</p><p>Bai remained silent, focusing on manipulating the demonic fire curse mark as it moved within his arm, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>After a short while, Bai's expression shifted slightly, and he pressed down sharply on the demonic fire curse mark.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A dark light erupted.</p><p>The demonic fire curse mark suddenly burst forth with a powerful surge. Under its impact, a faint blue glow emerged from Qin Sang's flesh, the fire curse runes faintly visible.</p><p>Within the runes, flames seemed to flicker. The moment they became visible, they were about to retract.</p><p>"Condense!"</p><p>Bai rapidly changed his hand seals.</p><p>The runes were instantly restrained by the power of the demonic fire curse mark.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp pain, and saw a tiny, inconspicuous blue light forced out by the demonic fire curse mark. The fire curse itself appeared – a wisp of blue flame.</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>Bai shouted, the demonic fire curse mark shaking violently.  The fire curse shattered and dissipated in the wind.</p><p>"The fire curse is broken?"</p><p>Qin Sang was ecstatic.</p><p>But Bai showed no joy.</p><p>He sighed softly, his tone tinged with helplessness, and said to Qin Sang,</p><p>"The fire curse is very complex! I only recalled fragments of it and created a crude curse mark. Using the demonic fire curse mark, I forced it out bit by bit, then crushed it with brute force, gradually clearing the fire curse from your body. But this method is slow, especially when removing the fire curse that has merged into your internal organs.  One careless mistake could severely injure you.  Before we can undo the curse, Mou Lao Mo will catch up."</p><p>Bai's tone was grave.</p><p>Hearing this news, Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>It seemed he faced a dead end.</p><p>Bai could escape at any time, while he could only close his eyes and wait for death.</p><p>"We don't need to immediately remove the fire curse. We can try to shield its fluctuations!"</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, not succumbing to despair. Numerous thoughts flashed through his mind.  "Perhaps we can also use external force, restrictions, spirit arrays... or the chaotic natural spiritual energy."</p><p>Qin Sang had actually foreseen this outcome, and had been considering all possibilities, preparing for the worst.</p><p>Old Man Mou, confident in his methods, must have believed his fire curse couldn't be easily broken.  And he was right; without Bai's help, even with his control over demonic fire, he would be powerless against it.</p><p>Bai pondered, then said, "Mou's ability to sense your location from such a distance is strongly linked to the Winter Nether Flame. It enhances the curse's power. Using a demonic fire seal to suppress the fire curse's fluctuations might work – it's worth trying! As for external assistance…"</p><p>"You mean the Storm Belt?"</p><p>Bai's eyes lit up.  "The chaotic spiritual energy within the Storm Belt could disrupt Mou's perception.  But we need to reach it before he catches us.  And the outer edges might not be enough.  Venturing deep into the Storm Belt, even if it shakes Mou off, could be incredibly dangerous…"</p><p>Bai hesitated.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang immediately changed course for the Storm Belt, it would take days to reach it. Mou wouldn't give them that much time.  And entering the Storm Belt's depths, while potentially escaping Mou, would expose them to chaotic spiritual tides, powerful hurricanes, and the very real risk of becoming lost.</p><p>This time, there was no one to guide them.</p><p>"Do you recall Yuan Zhu mentioning that his cave was a chance discovery? How credible do you find that?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. "Our strengths are comparable to Yuan Zhu's, yet I wouldn't dare wander freely in the Storm Belt.  Yet, he managed to find such a hidden cave."</p><p>Bai was startled. "You mean… he had a way to navigate within the Storm Belt?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  "For survival, I have to try the Storm Belt, however slim the chance.  Please help me one last time. If even Yuan Zhu was helpless, then don't join me in a suicide mission. We'll part ways here. I'll give you all the clues about the Sky Corpse Sect.  If I survive… we can meet again."</p><p>Bai looked deeply at Qin Sang. "Alright."</p><p>Qin Sang then explained his plan.</p><p>Bai thought for a long time, offering suggestions to refine it.</p><p>Finally, Bai sighed, "If your plan works, there's a real chance… but the cost is high. Are you sure you're willing to pay it?"</p><p>"Compared to my life, it's nothing," Qin Sang said with a self-deprecating smile, then added solemnly, "It's all up to you now."</p>
