<h1>Chapter 341: Reunion with Wanderer Yun</h1><p>Qin Sang placed the young man in sturdy clothing on the wooden bed.  He had already completed the first layer of restrictions when he captured him.</p><p>The young man's physical body and nascent soul were sealed, but from the outside, there wasn't much difference from when he was alive. Only his skin had a faint bluish-black tinge.</p><p>Even after being refined into a living corpse, the changes wouldn't be too significant, which was one of the differences between a living corpse and a demonic corpse.  To others, it would be almost impossible to tell that a living corpse was a refined corpse, especially when freshly refined.  Only with the passage of time would gradual changes become apparent.</p><p>Just like the living corpse he and Cultivator Baiyun encountered at the Corpse Refining Sect branch, after so many years, apart from the growth of fangs and claws, its appearance hadn't changed drastically.</p><p>Of course, the dense corpse Qi would still reveal its true nature.  But there were ways around that.</p><p>The biggest difference between living corpses and demonic corpses, and also the reason why living corpses were far more powerful, was that they could retain one spell they learned during their lifetime.  The refiner could also imbue them with a spell through a Corpse Refining Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang had already made his choice, deciding to imbue the living corpse with the *Soul Concealment Art*.</p><p>The *Soul Concealment Art* could not only hide cultivation levels but also mask demonic Qi, demonic energy, corpse Qi, and other unusual auras.  Back then, Gu Tiannan and his disciple relied on this art to conceal the demonic Qi generated from cultivating the *Corpse Pill Secret Art*, deceiving Qin Sang's senses.</p><p>With the *Soul Concealment Art*, the corpse Qi of the living corpse could be concealed as much as possible, only to be revealed during combat. Or a cultivator whose realm far surpassed that of the living corpse during its life could see through the disguise.</p><p>While it couldn't instantly increase its power, it could sometimes have miraculous effects.</p><p>The young man lay quietly on the wooden bed, oblivious to everything.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then conjured the Corpse Refining Talisman, placing it in his palm.  He cast countless restrictions, some landing on the talisman, others drifting towards the young man.</p><p>Gradually, an inexplicable connection seemed to form between the talisman and the young man.</p><p>Upon completing the last restriction, Qin Sang paused slightly, then suddenly widened his eyes, flipped his palm, and abruptly pressed the Corpse Refining Talisman onto the young man's forehead!</p><p>"Seal!"</p><p>With Qin Sang's shout, the talisman suddenly emitted a faint light, which vanished in a flash as it entered the young man's body and into his nascent soul space.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang felt an unusually strong resistance from the talisman. It vibrated incessantly under the impact.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense was even stronger than that of cultivators in the same realm.  Facing this resistance, he remained undaunted, carefully protecting the talisman and continuing the secret art step by step.</p><p>Finally, the resistance completely disappeared.</p><p>The Corpse Refining Talisman seal was complete!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, exhaling turbid air and looking down at the young man.</p><p>Whether to erase the person's consciousness was a decision left to the refiner.  If not erased, the resulting living corpse would possess higher sentience and slightly greater power.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang decided to erase the young man's consciousness.</p><p>This way, the young man was essentially dead, with only the activity of his nascent soul preserved by the Corpse Refining Talisman.</p><p>With the nascent soul sealed, the next step was refining the physical body. Only when the talisman and all the restrictions were connected and integrated would the refinement be considered complete.</p><p>This step was also quite difficult. To maintain the activity of the living corpse, the Qi Sea had to be preserved and not completely filled with Earthly Yin Qi.  If the Earthly Yin Qi damaged the Qi Sea, all efforts would be wasted.</p><p>Therefore, although Qin Sang was well-versed in the Five Elements Foundation Establishment, he didn't dare to be careless.</p><p>The young man had cultivated metal-attribute techniques during his lifetime, so Qin Sang started with Azure Nether Gold and, following the order of the Five Elements' mutual generation, infused the five Yin materials into his body.</p><p>As expected, the consumption of the five Yin materials was several times greater than that of refining a demonic corpse.  Fortunately, Qin Sang had prepared sufficiently.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Spiritual power swept up one of the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottles, sending it flying into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The bottle opened, and Earthly Yin Qi flowed out.  Under Qin Sang's control, it entered the location of the living corpse's dantian, immediately encountering resistance from the spiritual power within the Qi Sea.</p><p>This was completely different from refining a demonic corpse; a demonic corpse's dantian was empty!</p><p>Now, the spiritual power within the living corpse's Qi Sea began to fiercely retaliate, like a storm in the sea.  The Earthly Yin Qi and the spiritual power violently clashed, canceling each other out, neither yielding to the other.</p><p>Fortunately, the dantian was strengthened by the five Yin materials and the restrictions of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Art*, saving it from destruction.</p><p>Seeing that a bottle of Earthly Yin Qi was almost depleted, yet not a single wisp had entered the living corpse's dantian, Qin Sang's expression darkened.  The difficulty was far greater than he had imagined.</p><p>The second bottle of Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>Still the same!</p><p>The third bottle, still no hope of success.</p><p>Qin Sang gave up, interrupting the refinement process and resealing the corpse. It seemed a trip to Shaohua Mountain was inevitable, but only after dealing with the trouble at hand.</p><p>After clearing the residual aura from the cave, Qin Sang sat down in meditation and began cultivating.</p><p>On the fifth day, the restriction at the entrance of the cave was suddenly triggered. Qin Sang sensed it, woke from his meditation, and summoned the transmission talisman into his palm.  Seeing the message, his face lit up with joy.</p><p>Flying out of the cave, Qin Sang instructed Tan Hao to wait inside while he flew towards Yinshan Pass.</p><p>Spirit Pill Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang met Wanderer Yun again.</p><p>His appearance hadn't changed much, but his complexion looked a bit better than before.  It seemed the Nine Brilliance Frost Grass was indeed effective.</p><p>Wanderer Yun's aura was also much stronger than four years ago, likely at the peak of early Foundation Establishment, touching upon the bottleneck to mid-Foundation Establishment.</p><p>But he hadn't broken through yet, overtaken by Qin Sang.</p><p>However, just from appearances, Qin Sang couldn't tell if Wanderer Yun's soul injuries had healed.</p><p>While Qin Sang observed Wanderer Yun, the latter also noticed that Qin Sang had broken through to mid-Foundation Establishment.  Somewhat puzzled, he asked, "Brother Qin, have you refined the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p>Wanderer Yun's expression sank.  Without refining the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, yet breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment so quickly, there could only be one explanation: the Mystic Pattern Harmony Pill couldn't heal Qin Sang's injuries and had to be used to enhance his cultivation.</p><p>"I don't know whether to congratulate you," Wanderer Yun sighed, then consoled Qin Sang, "But Brother Qin's breakthrough to mid-Foundation Establishment is still something to be happy about.  Much better than this old man."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and quickly asked, "Was the Nine Brilliance Frost Grass ineffective for you?"</p><p>Even the thousand-year-old Nine Brilliance Frost Grass couldn't heal Wanderer Yun.</p><p>Were his soul injuries even more severe than Qin Sang's damaged foundation?</p><p>Wanderer Yun sighed, "It had some effect, better than nothing!  Actually, I didn't expect the Nine Brilliance Frost Grass to completely cure my injuries, but I thought it could at least heal a few layers, so I wouldn't have to worry about it before forming my core.  Who would have thought that its effect was even worse than expected? I'm still stuck at early Foundation Establishment, unable to make any progress."</p>
