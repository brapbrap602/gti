<h1>Chapter 338: Never Give Up</h1><p>For over forty years, Tan Hao has never given up on Tan Jie, carrying his comatose brother with him on the arduous path of cultivation.  He not only had to painstakingly accumulate resources for his own cultivation but also search for spirit medicines to sustain Tan Jie's life and treat his injuries.</p><p>No wonder Tan Hao is in such dire straits!</p><p>A thirteenth-level Qi Refinement cultivator is not at the very bottom of the cultivation world. Basic cultivation resources shouldn't be lacking, at least an ordinary cave dwelling should be affordable.</p><p>But Tan Hao spent most of his savings on Tan Jie.</p><p>No wonder Tan Hao hasn't been able to establish his foundation!</p><p>Under such difficult circumstances, it's already remarkable that he has reached the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement.</p><p>Unless Tan Hao encounters some extraordinary opportunity, it would be virtually impossible for him to gather the resources needed to establish his foundation.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the events at the auction and the black market; this scenario had likely played out countless times for Tan Hao.</p><p>He gives everything he has to acquire any spirit medicine that might be useful for Tan Jie.</p><p>Tan Hao took out the Tranquility Pill he had obtained at the black market, opened the jade coffin, gently helped Tan Jie up, and used his spiritual energy to dissolve the medicinal power of the Tranquility Pill before feeding it to Tan Jie.</p><p>One pill, acquired with such desperate effort, only strengthened Tan Jie's primordial spirit by a little.</p><p>Before, it was like a lamp running out of oil, the faint flame about to be extinguished. Now, it was as if a single drop of oil had been added, allowing it to burn a little longer.</p><p>That was all.  It couldn't change the fundamental problem.</p><p>It did almost nothing to help Tan Jie's injuries, still unable to stop the dissipation of his primordial spirit, with no sign of awakening. This showed how severe Tan Jie's injuries were.</p><p>A question involuntarily arose in Qin Sang's heart: Was it worth it?</p><p>With Tan Hao's current cultivation level, he might not find a cure for Tan Jie in his lifetime. Even if he did, by some miracle, he couldn't afford it or seize it.</p><p>And his own path of cultivation had been delayed.</p><p>The final outcome was not difficult to imagine. When Tan Hao's lifespan reached its end, Tan Jie would also die.</p><p>Tan Hao had given Tan Jie a few more decades of life, but as a living corpse, unconscious, unable to move, spending his life in a daze, knowing nothing.</p><p>It seemed utterly meaningless!</p><p>But looking at Tan Hao's expression, he clearly felt it was all worth it.</p><p>Perhaps out of guilt towards his brother, perhaps out of brotherly love…</p><p>No regrets!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of someone—Senior Sister Qing Ting.</p><p>How similar she was to Tan Hao!</p><p>Senior Sister Qing Ting was devoted to her Dao Companion, Senior Brother Jiang, while Tan Hao was devoted to his brother, Tan Jie.</p><p>One was romantic love.</p><p>The other was brotherly love.</p><p>Both were so wholehearted, giving their all, never giving up!</p><p>To cure Senior Brother Jiang, Senior Sister Qing Ting tried everything, exhausting her savings to refine the Fire Crow Talisman and enter the Heavenly Corpse Sect ruins to search for the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>But because she had sold all her magical artifacts to buy materials, she died at the hands of a malicious corpse.</p><p>In her final moments, Senior Brother Jiang miraculously awoke, tightly gripping Senior Sister Qing Ting's hand. The single tear he shed was the greatest comfort to her.</p><p>He knew all her efforts; they were not in vain.</p><p>The scene Qin Sang witnessed in the Heavenly Corpse Cave remained vivid in his memory, prompting much reflection.  He hadn't expected to see a similar scene today.</p><p>In the cultivation world, as long as one is alive, as long as there is a glimmer of hope, any miracle could happen!</p><p>Tan Hao must also hold this belief, which is why he carries this burden, persisting until now, right?</p><p>If he chose to give up on Tan Jie, and later encountered a genuine opportunity to cure him, the regret would be unbearable.</p><p>A wistful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face, his eyes flickering slightly, as if contemplating something.</p><p>"These spirit liquids are infused with a spirit medicine called Purple Gold Salve, thanks to Senior Sister Shi Hong…"</p><p>Tan Hao carefully laid Tan Jie back down, letting him rest once more in the spirit liquid within the coffin.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned to the spirit liquid in the coffin.</p><p>A faint purple hue shimmered within the transparent liquid.  This spirit liquid contained a life force capable of preserving Tan Jie's physical body. This must be the effect of the Purple Gold Salve that Tan Hao mentioned.</p><p>However, the purple within the liquid was very faint, indicating that the potency of the Purple Gold Salve might not last much longer, almost exhausted!</p><p>Qin Sang could imagine that if Tan Hao hadn't encountered this mishap and had successfully returned with the Tranquility Pill, he probably wouldn't have had time to rest. He would have had to immediately set out again to find spirit medicines to nourish Tan Jie's physical body.</p><p>Tan Hao had been living like this for all these years, hadn't he?</p><p>“The first time I met Senior Sister Shi Hong, after she heard about Tan Jie's situation, she didn’t hesitate to give me all her savings. Only then was I able to afford the Purple Gold Salve and have a breather to cultivate for a few years, breaking through to the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement.  Otherwise, Tan Jie might not have lasted until now. Senior Sister Shi Hong is our brothers' savior, but I have never been able to repay her…"</p><p>When mentioning Shi Hong, Tan Hao's voice was filled with gratitude.  This imposing man suddenly bowed, almost begging Qin Sang, about to perform a grand salute.</p><p>"Brother Qin, please, you must rescue Senior Sister! In this life, I am already a cripple, and I don’t know how I can help you to repay your kindness. I will forever remember this debt.  If I cannot repay it in this life, I am willing to be your ox and horse in the next!"</p><p>Qin Sang reacted quickly, sending out a wave of spiritual energy to stop Tan Hao's bow. He said solemnly, "The four of us are fellow disciples.  You don't need to say it; I will do my utmost to rescue you and Senior Sister Shi Hong!  As for repayment, consider it just a figure of speech.  Don't mention it again!"</p><p>After stopping Tan Hao, Qin Sang walked to the jade coffin and extended his divine sense into Tan Jie's body.</p><p>Tan Jie's physical injuries had healed, but the most critical issue was his primordial spirit, which, like Senior Brother Jiang's, was slowly dissipating.</p><p>After a careful examination, he asked Tan Hao, "Have you consulted any experts in medicinal arts?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Tan Hao nodded.  "Before Tan Jie's injuries worsened, the required spirit medicines weren't excessive, and the burden wasn't too heavy for me.  I heard that the Spirit Pill Pavilion in Gloom Pass is a branch of the Grand Clarity Pill Pavilion, and it has alchemists from the Grand Clarity Pill Sect, but their fees are exorbitant.  I saved for nearly ten years to gather enough spirit stones and then took Tan Jie to the Spirit Pill Pavilion to consult an alchemist."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked, "What did he say?"</p><p>Tan Hao's eyes dimmed, and he said helplessly, "He only took one look and declared Tan Jie beyond saving. He told me that even if all the treasured spirit pills of the Grand Clarity Pill Sect were used, Tan Jie couldn’t be saved. At most, he could live a few more years in a muddled state. He advised me to give up quickly and not waste my efforts."</p><p>"But you still persisted."</p><p>Qin Sang said with deep emotion.</p><p>In the Small Cold Region, the conclusion reached by an alchemist of the Grand Clarity Pill Pavilion was almost impossible to overturn unless a miracle occurred.</p><p>"How could I give up on him?"</p><p>Tan Hao clenched his fists, tears welling in his eyes. He murmured, "If I had persisted a little longer back then, the one cultivating the Yama Banner would have been me! My brother… he died in my place! How can I give up on him!"</p><p>"No matter what, I cannot give up on him!"</p>
