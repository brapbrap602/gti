<h1>Chapter 555: Skyfall Stone</h1><p>After Granny Jing left, Qin Sang went out, heading straight for the various trading companies. After making the rounds and meeting with Wandering Scholar, he returned to Che Yutao's residence just as dawn broke.</p><p>Qin Sang was contacting the trading companies, spreading the word that he possessed a Purple Star Secret Key and was looking to trade it.</p><p>With Duke Dongyang's backing, the Secret Key was no longer necessary.</p><p>He had acquired two Secret Keys unexpectedly, neither of which he ended up using.  The Purple Star Palace would open in less than six months, and the sooner he spread the word, the better his chances of exchanging it for something he truly desired.</p><p>Those competing for the Secret Keys were mostly Core Formation cultivators. Qin Sang had researched the prices fetched by Secret Keys at several recent auctions and had a general idea of their value.</p><p>His desired exchange was for a Skyfall Stone and a piece of Myriad Age Camphorwood.</p><p>At the auction at Gloom Mountain Pass where the first Secret Key appeared, the mysterious Core Formation cultivator had initially demanded a magic treasure, clearly an inflated price designed to attract attention. The final成交 price was much lower.</p><p>Sects with Nascent Soul patriarchs didn't need the Secret Keys.</p><p>Smaller sects and rogue cultivators might be hesitant to pay such a high price for a gamble, especially in a dangerous place where they'd be risking their lives.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure if he could make the trade, even for just these two spirit materials.</p><p>After putting out the word, Qin Sang settled down to cultivate at Che Yutao's residence.</p><p>His first priority was to subdue the malevolent spirits within the Black Tortoise Seal, then to devote all his energy to healing the Sky Roc Demon.</p><p>Four months passed in a flash.</p><p>Since releasing the news about the Secret Key, Qin Sang had met with a few people, but no deals were struck. To his disappointment, he still hadn't heard anything about the Skyfall Stone or the Myriad Age Camphorwood.</p><p>If he had, he would have found a way to acquire them.</p><p>The moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>The residence was exceptionally quiet, moonlight flowing like water into the courtyard.</p><p>Time was running out. Autumn Dusk White and the others were focusing all their efforts on taming the malevolent spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang was studying the refining notes Shopkeeper Wu had given him when he suddenly felt a stir in his heart. He looked down at the jade pendant at his waist and saw a faint, ethereal glow emanating from it.</p><p>This communication jade, given to him by the Grand Unity Elixir Pavilion, had a limited range and barely functioned within the city.</p><p>Seeing the change in the jade, Qin Sang's face lit up.  He rose to his feet, left Che Yutao's residence, found a secluded spot to change and don a mask, and hurried towards the Grand Unity Elixir Pavilion.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng has arrived!"</p><p>A clerk was already waiting for him at the entrance of the pavilion.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the clerk immediately led him towards a quiet room, explaining in a low voice, "Daoist, a senior approached us a quarter of an hour ago, claiming to have information on the Skyfall Stone and Myriad Age Camphorwood.  He wishes to exchange them for the Secret Key and requested your presence."</p><p>"Just information, not the actual items?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, frowning slightly.</p><p>"It wasn't specified," the clerk shook his head. "The senior was unwilling to divulge details, insisting on seeing you and the Secret Key in person.  He didn't conceal his identity; he's the Eight Swords Elder, sect master of the Wind Sword Sect. He's unlikely to deceive us."</p><p>"He has information on both?"</p><p>"He claims to have information on both."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, recalling what he knew of the Wind Sword Sect.</p><p>The Wind Sword Sect was once a powerful sect, comparable to the Eight Righteous Sects. After the passing of their Nascent Soul ancestor, subsequent generations failed to live up to their predecessor, and the sect gradually declined.</p><p>Now, it was a minor sect. The sect master, Eight Swords Elder, had some renown; it was said his natal flying sword could split into eight and his swordsmanship was exceptional.</p><p>However, he was advanced in age and only at the early stage of Core Formation, not a leader who could revive the sect.</p><p>The Wind Sword Sect was also known for its swordsmanship, but unlike Mount Shaohua, its disciples were true sword cultivators, adhering to the principle of direct confrontation rather than cunning tactics.</p><p>Eight Swords Elder would certainly care about the sect's reputation. The Wind Sword Sect was currently affiliated with the Spirit Control Sect, and most of its disciples operated near the Nine Nether Pass.  He wouldn't have traveled so far for frivolous reasons.</p><p>Reassured, Qin Sang pushed open the door and entered. He saw a scholarly-looking man with a goatee, appearing to be in his fifties, sitting inside, accompanied by a manager of the Grand Unity Elixir Pavilion.</p><p>"My apologies for making you wait, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly.</p><p>Eight Swords Elder didn't put on any airs. He immediately rose to greet Qin Sang, unperturbed by the mask.  He smiled and said, "It is I who have imposed upon Daoist. Please, have a seat."</p><p>The manager from the Grand Unity Elixir Pavilion acted as a witness.</p><p>The two sat facing each other. After brief pleasantries, they got straight to the point.</p><p>"Please take a look, Senior."</p><p>Unafraid of theft, Qin Sang took out the Purple Star Secret Key and handed it to Eight Swords Elder for inspection.</p><p>The Secret Key was easily verifiable. Upon seeing the illusory image of the Purple Star Palace, Eight Swords Elder returned the key to Qin Sang. After a moment of contemplation, he asked, "Daoist Qingfeng, must this be exchanged for both the Skyfall Stone and Myriad Age Camphorwood?"</p><p>Here it comes.</p><p>Qin Sang's voice deepened. "Indeed. I am gathering spirit materials to refine a magic treasure, and these two are the most difficult to find."</p><p>Eight Swords Elder looked up at Qin Sang, then abruptly changed his tone. "If I'm not mistaken, Daoist has yet to reach Core Formation, have you?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and countered, "My cultivation level shouldn't affect our transaction, should it?"</p><p>"Not at all, not at all," Eight Swords Elder shook his head repeatedly. "To be frank, Daoist, I only possess a piece of Skyfall Stone. However, I'm willing to offer a spirit item that aids in reaching Core Formation in place of the Myriad Age Camphorwood. It's of middling grade. What are your thoughts, Daoist?"</p><p>As he spoke, Eight Swords Elder took out a stone resembling an inkstone and placed it before Qin Sang.</p><p>The Skyfall Stone was jet black with an exceptionally smooth texture. Its surface shimmered with a peculiar luster, and cloud-like grey patterns flickered within, quite extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed it was genuine Skyfall Stone and felt a surge of joy.  After waiting so long, he'd finally found one.</p><p>However, he was reluctant to trade the Secret Key for just the Skyfall Stone.</p><p>Without revealing his emotions, he slowly shook his head. "To be honest, Senior, I'm confident in my ability to reach Core Formation.  A spirit item to assist in that endeavor wouldn't be of much use to me."</p><p>Eight Swords Elder looked at him in surprise, likely having never encountered such a bold individual. He frowned, then said, "Has Daoist inquired about the prices other Secret Keys have fetched? The highest price was only three fist-sized pieces of Star Sand Steel.  With such a high asking price and no room for negotiation, you're unlikely to succeed. How about this…"</p><p>Eight Swords Elder's expression turned serious. "I don't have Myriad Age Camphorwood, but I once learned from a jade slip in a secret realm that its growing place often attracts a specific type of companion spirit beast. I'll give you the jade slip, and you can follow the clues to find the Myriad Age Camphorwood.  It's better than searching blindly, wouldn't you agree?"</p>
