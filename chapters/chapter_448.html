<h1>Chapter 441: The Serpent Hag</h1><p>Approaching the large disc, Qin Sang felt a sudden chill.</p><p>A terrifying coldness emanated from ahead, second only to the Xuan Frost Gale!</p><p>As they drew closer, Qin Sang felt his spiritual energy becoming stagnant, his body on the verge of freezing.</p><p>Finally, he saw Teng Zhao Gang.</p><p>His entire body was covered in a thick layer of frost, resembling a snowman. The disc rested on his knees, continuously emitting cold air.</p><p>Opposite Teng Zhao Gang sat a fellow disciple from the Taiyi Dan Sect, looking equally miserable.</p><p>They were manipulating the disc, supporting the larger disc above, assisting the Di surname Golden Core cultivator in setting up the array.</p><p>However, even from this close, Qin Sang couldn't see the larger disc.</p><p>Above Teng Zhao Gang's head, the cold air gathered into a cloud, like a giant snowdrift, suspended in mid-air, emanating extreme coldness.</p><p>“Help me dispel the cold…”</p><p>Teng Zhao Gang's teeth chattered, his voice weak, yet he persisted in manipulating the disc, not daring to relax.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhan Yi landed on either side of Teng Zhao Gang.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang retrieved a teapot-shaped artifact from his pouch.</p><p>This artifact was personally refined by Qin Sang, forged from the incompletely destroyed Wan Ya Pot and another artifact.  Qin Sang called it the Wan Yan Pot.</p><p>The smoke from the Wan Ya Pot was inherently fiery, the transformed crows being a type of fire crow, containing abundant fire elemental power. The other fused artifact possessed similar properties.</p><p>At the time, Qin Sang had attempted this fusion to salvage the excellent Wan Ya Pot and hone his refining skills.  Unexpectedly, he succeeded on his first try.</p><p>The resulting Wan Yan Pot, though not of improved quality, possessed even more abundant fire elemental power, exhaling not smoke, but spiritual flames.</p><p>Its function had also changed, shifting from defense to attack.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Wan Yan Pot, releasing a torrent of flames around the three, dispelling the chill.</p><p>Zhan Yi brought out a fire-attribute flying sword, wielding it to unleash flames, but the effect was limited.</p><p>…</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang entered the array.</p><p>Several figures flew in from the horizon. The Di surname Golden Core cultivator breathed a sigh of relief, saying, "Fellow cultivators, you've arrived just in time! Quickly help me stabilize the array and complete the formation!"</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, Qin Sang was nearing exhaustion, when Teng Zhao Gang was finally able to disengage.</p><p>Returning to the lower levels, he discovered that the area had undergone a dramatic transformation.</p><p>On all sides, and above, a boundless sea of fog enveloped everything.</p><p>The array's range was even larger than Qin Sang had imagined.  He flew closer to the fog, only then barely perceiving the boundaries of the space. The white fog hung thick and persistent, covering the entire area.</p><p>Below the fog, a layer less than ten feet high, the fog was thin, not obstructing vision.</p><p>Despite the thin fog, the weather within the area was constantly changing—sometimes heavy snow, sometimes light snow, sometimes a drizzle, sometimes fierce winds...</p><p>No wonder it was called the True Water Thousand Illusions Array; it truly was ever-changing.</p><p>The entire area felt like a shelter made of fog, the low ceiling inducing a sense of oppression.</p><p>However, being inside, he felt considerably safer than before.</p><p>After all, protected by the array, they were less likely to be caught in a sudden battle.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings, noticing the Di surname Golden Core cultivator meditating in the center of the largest island, surrounded by other powerful cultivators, all Golden Core stage experts.</p><p>The array seemed incomplete; they were still working.</p><p>Even Qin Sang could sense their weakened auras, highlighting the difficulty of setting up the True Water Thousand Illusions Array.</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao was not among them. Was he still battling?</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, the Di surname Golden Core cultivator sensed something, suddenly opening his eyes, looking south, and shouting, "Open!"</p><p>Immediately, a faint white light shone through the dense fog, piercing beyond it. With the swirling fog, a narrow passage appeared.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>Several figures flew through the passage.</p><p>Accompanying them was Deputy Island Master Xiao's urgent voice: "Quickly seal the array!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely.  Dozens of figures had appeared on the island. Most had torn robes, their artifacts not yet retrieved; some bore grievous wounds, displaying their disheveled state.</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao and Che Yu Tao were among them.</p><p>However, at the center stood an old woman wielding a serpent staff.</p><p>Seeing the respectful demeanor of Di Xing, Jin Dan, and the others towards the old woman, Qin Sang was secretly surprised. The island master of Stargazing Island was this old woman.</p><p>Beside the old woman stood a strange person, close to her. His upper body was that of a handsome man, but his lower body was a snake's. Instead of a tongue, a crimson snake's tongue flickered in his mouth.</p><p>His pupils were vertical, like a snake's, and his gaze held a chilling coldness.</p><p>Qin Sang had asked Zhan Yi about him. This person was called She Po, the deputy sect master of the Spirit Control Sect.</p><p>This half-human, half-snake being was nominally the old woman's spirit beast. In reality, he was a demon beast from the Heavenly Demon Hill, imbued with imperial essence and granted sentience long ago. He was then sent to the Spirit Control Sect and made a pact with She Po.</p><p>It was said that this being held a significant position in Heavenly Demon Hill and possessed strength comparable to She Po.</p><p>The Spirit Control Sect's mountain gate is located northwest of the Yuan Shen Sect, the closest sect to Heavenly Demon Hill in the Xiaohan region, a sect with complex ties to both righteous and demonic cultivators.  It's the closest to the Heavenly Demon Hill.</p><p>Like the Shangyuan Pure Palace and several other sects, the Spirit Control Sect is an ancient sect with a long history. Regardless of the changing tides, it always maintains a prominent position in the Xiaohan region.</p><p>Its foundation far surpasses that of fleeting demonic sects like the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>The Spirit Control Sect relies on its close relationship with Heavenly Demon Hill. Even without a Nascent Soul cultivator, other sects are reluctant to provoke them.</p><p>Rumor has it that there are very few true Nascent Soul cultivators in the Xiaohan region.</p><p>The current Spirit Control Sect doesn't have a sect master. There are no Nascent Soul cultivators within the sect; She Po is the true leader.</p><p>Several sects among the eight righteous sects and established demonic sects are similar to the Spirit Control Sect—lacking Nascent Soul cultivators, yet possessing means to intimidate even Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>This contradicted Qin Sang's understanding during his Qi Condensation stage, but that's understandable.</p><p>He was not yet qualified to know such secrets, and could only treat them as legends. Even the rumors he heard now might not be true.</p><p>Seeing She Po and the snake-bodied man looking around, Qin Sang felt inexplicably uneasy and quickly averted his gaze. He had the remains of the Spirit Control Sect's Golden Core cultivator in his storage bag and couldn't afford to reveal himself.</p><p>Being a Golden Core cultivator himself, Qin Sang couldn't fully perceive their cultivation techniques, but he could glean some information from their artifacts.  Cultivators from all factions in Xiaohan region, righteous, demonic, and independent, were present.</p><p>Among them, two individuals were being protected: Elder Fang and Elder Shen Tu, the ones who were first ambushed.</p>
