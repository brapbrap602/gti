<h1>Chapter 1171: The Gap</h1><p>The Serpent King looked around, pointed to two distant peaks, and drew a circle.  "The battlefield is limited to the open space between these two mountains. Anyone who flies outside the boundary will be considered defeated."</p><p>Qin Sang and the Qieji Yao Wang had no objections.</p><p>The rules were set.</p><p>The Serpent King flashed to a peak outside the battlefield to watch, while Qin Sang and the Qieji Yao Wang flew into the arena.</p><p>Between the two mountains lay a wide open space, like a fighting ring.</p><p>They stood at opposite ends of the battlefield, gazing at each other.</p><p>The auras of the top cultivators in the cultivation world emanated outwards, the terrifying pressure causing the birds and beasts in the surrounding mountains to flee in terror.</p><p>The Blackwood Sword was not yet complete.</p><p>Qin Sang could only choose another spirit sword as a substitute.</p><p>At this time, he had already transformed using the Heavenly Demon Transformation, his other hand secretly making hand seals, ready to summon the Demon Banner at any moment.</p><p>The opponent was prepared, so naturally he had to go all out.</p><p>The Qieji Yao Wang's eyes, like a snake's, were vertical pupils, his gaze cold.  Without any extra expression, anyone who met his direct stare would feel a chill run down their spine.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang's mind moved slightly, he flicked his sleeve, and a sword energy flew from his fingertip.</p><p>Spirit swords circled and danced around Qin Sang, emitting piercing sword cries.  The area around Qin Sang was dazzlingly bright, countless real and illusory sword lights crisscrossing.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang's figure was obscured by the sword light, difficult to discern with the naked eye.</p><p>Facing a Yuan Ying-level opponent for the first time, he was very cautious. He didn't choose to attack first, but planned to respond to his opponent's moves, gauging their abilities.</p><p>The Qieji Yao Wang, already knowing Qin Sang's mastery of swordsmanship, showed no surprise.</p><p>He coldly glanced at Qin Sang, then a layer of black energy suddenly enveloped his face.  He opened his mouth wide and spat out balls of black mist.</p><p>The black mist was exceptionally dense. As soon as it appeared, it quickly spread out.</p><p>The mist wasn't aimed directly at Qin Sang. It spread rapidly in all directions before converging, soon engulfing the entire battlefield.</p><p>For a moment, the battlefield was pitch black, with zero visibility.</p><p>Where Qin Sang stood, the black mist closed in, surrounding him as well.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang smelled a sweet fragrance, his expression changed slightly, and he felt a sudden alert. Without hesitation, he sealed his mouth and nostrils, vibrating his True Qi to isolate himself from the black mist.</p><p>He tried to dispel the mist, but it continued to replenish itself endlessly.</p><p>The Qieji Yao Wang was a snake demon; this black mist was likely a supernatural ability he had cultivated for many years, containing a potent poison.</p><p>If only the Fat Silkworm were awake.  No matter how powerful the poison in this mist was, it wouldn't be stronger than the three most poisonous places in the Seven Killing Hall. Wearing the anti-poison armor, he wouldn't need to worry at all.</p><p>After breaking through to Yuan Ying, Qin Sang had tried many times to communicate with Ya Gu and the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>He had received no response.</p><p>Ya Gu was sleeping even more soundly than before.</p><p>Before, with the Fat Silkworm as an anchor, Qin Sang could feel the fluctuations of Ya Gu's soul. Now that the anchor was also asleep, Ya Gu's inner world was silent.</p><p>Thankfully, he had the Soul-Nourishing Wood; otherwise, he didn't know if Ya Gu could even survive.</p><p>Qin Sang worried about Ya Gu, but there was nothing he could do for now. It was uncertain how long it would take to refine the Corpse Soul Pearl, so for now, he could only start with Tan Hao's clues and investigate the Sky Corpse Sect.</p><p>'Hiss… hiss…'</p><p>The black mist began to corrode his spirit armor.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly.  This level of damage was acceptable, not too much of a burden in a short time.</p><p>Although the black mist obstructed his vision, it could not block his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, finding the entire battlefield enveloped in the black mist. He secretly pondered, the Qieji Yao Wang was clearly prepared, the battlefield's boundaries were part of their plan.</p><p>Going to all this trouble couldn't be just to consume a bit of his True Qi. The black mist probably had other unknown uses.</p><p>With this thought in mind, Qin Sang's expression tightened. He found that the Qieji Yao Wang had moved.</p><p>A figure silently approached him.</p><p>Within the black mist, the Qieji Yao Wang was extremely well-concealed, making no waves.</p><p>However, under the Heavenly Eye Divine Ability, it was doomed to be useless.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out, a sword light suddenly cutting into the depths of the black mist.</p><p>The black mist vibrated, a dark shadow flickering.</p><p>At this time, the Qieji Yao Wang was still some distance from Qin Sang. Seeing his whereabouts exposed, a ferocious look flashed across his face. He let out a low roar, then his speed surged, diving towards Qin Sang like a great peng spreading its wings.</p><p>The speed the Qieji Yao Wang now displayed even surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, disappearing in place.</p><p>Electricity pierced through the black mist.  Qin Sang's first reaction was to use Thunder Escape to temporarily evade.</p><p>Immediately after, his guess was confirmed. He sensed something unusual.</p><p>Flying through the black mist, a strange sluggishness slowed Qin Sang's movements.  In contrast, the Qianji Demon King moved with newfound agility, several times faster than before.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang moved, the Demon King instantly predicted his direction and gave chase.  Simultaneously, the black mist around Qin Sang seemed to come alive, twisting into indescribable shapes that entangled him. Though Qin Sang quickly shattered them, the attacks still hampered his speed.</p><p>The black mist swirled as the two clashed within.  While the Demon King's escape technique was inferior to Qin Sang's, he moved like a fish in water within the mist, incredibly nimble.  The battlefield was confined, preventing Qin Sang from utilizing his lightning-fast escape to its full potential.  The black mist further restricted his movements, giving the Demon King a clear advantage. Qin Sang couldn't shake him off.</p><p>Realizing that prolonging the fight worked against him – a situation the Demon King clearly favored – Qin Sang abruptly stopped, turning to face his pursuer. A cold glint flashed in his eyes. Instead of summoning his sword, he lunged at the Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang's attack was lightning-fast, a powerful punch aimed squarely at the Demon King's face. The Demon King's expression shifted, a smirk replacing his previous wariness. He thrust out his right arm, drawing the surrounding black mist towards it.  In a blink, his arm transformed into a black serpent, its strange contortions catching Qin Sang's fist.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The impact, though not visually spectacular, was brutal.  The two figures recoiled, flying several meters backward.  Qin Sang clenched his fist, a strange, numbing energy coursing from his fingers to his shoulder.  He secretly channeled his inner energy to counteract it. He hadn't gained an advantage; in fact, he'd suffered a slight setback. The Demon King's physique was remarkably strong, his mastery of close-quarters combat even more so.</p><p>Qin Sang, relying primarily on swordsmanship and magical artifacts, had rarely engaged in pure hand-to-hand combat. The difference was immediately apparent.</p><p>The Demon King shook his arm, a mocking smile playing on his lips as he observed Qin Sang's relatively simplistic fighting style.</p><p>*"Condense!"*</p><p>The Demon King growled, gathering the black mist once more. It solidified into black armor around him.  With a sudden movement, he closed the distance between them.</p><p>Qin Sang saw only two serpentine shadows, each capable of countless attacks.</p>
