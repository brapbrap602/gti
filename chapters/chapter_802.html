<h1>Chapter 794: Gushan Island</h1><p>A swirling vortex appeared within the hurricane above the wasteland.  The vortex was slowly shrinking, the spirit array that had breached the immortal formation was collapsing, and everyone had to escape the Seven Kills Hall before the passage disappeared.</p><p>Dry grass swayed in the wasteland.</p><p>A figure appeared without warning, cautiously looking around before transforming into a streak of light, shooting towards the passage.  Before entering, the figure activated a jade talisman for protection and vanished into the vortex.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed this, but he wasn't in a hurry to leave. He took out his own jade talisman, preparing himself as he waited patiently at the edge of the wasteland.</p><p>Then, he retrieved the bone flute from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>He still couldn't determine if the bone flute was a magical treasure or something else. But he was certain it wasn't from this world, otherwise, the fragments couldn't be separated by such a vast distance.</p><p>The bone flute was mysterious, able to connect with the power of the constellations, yet it hadn't displayed the power expected of such a treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the bronze piece he'd retrieved for Yun Youzi in the Ziwei Palace.  A fragment of an immortal cauldron, the bronze piece remained incredibly heavy and caused even the Nanming Li Fire to recoil.</p><p>Qin Sang fiddled with the bone flute, his eyes fixed on the wasteland.</p><p>Time slowly passed, and cultivators returned from the depths of the Seven Kills Hall, flying into the passage one after another. During this time, Qin Sang saw Lady Liu again, but he didn't call out, simply watching her leave.</p><p>He hadn't seen Xiang Yi. If Xiang Yi had died inside, it would be a good thing, eliminating a lot of trouble.</p><p>Compared to what he'd seen at East Gate Island, far fewer cultivators had escaped the Seven Kills Hall, clearly many had perished within.</p><p>As Qin Sang waited, he also observed, spotting a few figures that seemed to possess Nascent Soul auras, making him even more cautious. He remained far away precisely to avoid attracting unwanted attention.</p><p>"Fewer and fewer people…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The passage had shrunk by half since he'd arrived; time was running out.</p><p>“If that person died in the Seven Kills Hall, the hope of restoring the bone flute would be slim. The Hall is so vast, searching every inch is impossible. I can only hope he left early, offering another chance outside…”</p><p>This thought arose in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Just then, the bone flute in his hand suddenly lit up with a faint glow.</p><p>The change was unexpected.  Qin Sang, who had been waiting for this moment, saw the glow and his expression changed. He immediately suppressed his excitement, discerned the direction the bone flute indicated, and looked up sharply towards a distant mountain.</p><p>The mountain appeared peaceful; no one was in sight.</p><p>The person with the other bone flute fragment must be hiding there!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to move closer, he saw a streak of azure light shoot out from the mountain.</p><p>Brilliant and incredibly fast, the azure light pierced the sky, racing towards the passage.</p><p>Within the azure light, the faint image of wings could be seen. The person controlling the light seemed to transform into a bird, flapping its wings and achieving a speed that Qin Sang envied.</p><p>The person seemed to be fleeing, as if pursued, not entering the wasteland but heading directly for the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see their face, let alone determine their identity.</p><p>He looked in the direction the person had come from, but no one was in pursuit.  The person was too fast, entering the passage in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This caught Qin Sang off guard. His chosen hiding spot was rather remote, and the light on the bone flute was dimming, the connection weakening.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He activated his secret talisman and Sword Qi Thunder Sound, bursting forth at his maximum speed in pursuit.</p><p>A terrifying force slammed against him.</p><p>Nearing the passage, Qin Sang was almost thrown back.</p><p>He poured his power into the jade talisman, activating a protective blood shield to stabilize himself.</p><p>The familiar sensation returned.</p><p>Entering the immortal formation, Qin Sang was like a lone boat in a stormy sea, tossed about by chaotic waves, struggling to control his direction. Fortunately, the force was pushing him from behind, towards the exit of the formation.</p><p>The blood shield from the jade talisman flickered precariously, cracks appearing on its surface.</p><p>Having experienced this before, Qin Sang glanced at it but paid it no mind, keeping his eyes fixed on the bone flute. The flute's glow was faint like a dying candle, but thankfully, the connection hadn't been severed.</p><p>Qin Sang strained every fiber of his being, struggling through the violent turbulence, moving towards the direction indicated by the bone flute.</p><p>After an unknown period, Qin Sang suddenly felt a release of pressure, followed by a piercing chill. Opening his eyes, he found himself underwater.</p><p>The sea here was also turbulent, with hurricane-driven waves and powerful currents.</p><p>Though the surrounding forces were chaotic, they were far weaker than the terrifying fluctuations within the wind barrier. Qin Sang knew he had successfully exited the immortal formation. He used a water遁 technique, striving to reach the surface.</p><p>He had entered through the wind barrier, yet emerged in the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang was disoriented, unsure where the Seven Kills Hall was located.</p><p>Fortunately, the connection remained, and seemed to have strengthened within the formation. The bone flute shone brightly; the other person was above.</p><p>To avoid attracting attention, Qin Sang stored the bone flute in his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>When Qin Sang broke the surface, he found himself outside the wind barrier, amidst a raging storm.  He could only see churning waves in every direction, unable to discern the distant landscape. He relied solely on the bone flute's guidance to approach the other person.</p><p>Within the storm, constant activation of protective treasures was necessary, making it difficult to maintain speed.</p><p>As Qin Sang battled the wind and waves, he noticed the other person hardly changed direction, their destination clear, and not East Gate Island.</p><p>"No wonder I haven't encountered them at East Gate Island. They must have come from one of the other two islands. Judging by the direction, it's likely Gushan Island…"</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately slowed down, not wanting to approach yet. He pondered, planning to confirm the person's identity after reaching Gushan Island.</p><p>The person’s speed had astonished Qin Sang. The wing-like shadows in the azure light didn't seem like a magical treasure. If they were a manifestation of the person’s own power, then their strength might even surpass Xiang Yi, likely a peak Late Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang desired the bone flute and hoped for a peaceful exchange.</p><p>However, his cultivation was inferior.  A hasty approach could cause misunderstanding. Or, if the person saw Qin Sang’s low cultivation and had murderous intentions, a battle would be unavoidable.</p><p>Qin Sang's escape techniques were exceptional, allowing him to come and go freely, unafraid even of powerful opponents. But against this person, it became a disadvantage.</p><p>Placing all his hopes on the Fire Pearl was unwise. If the Fire Pearl failed, he would be in a precarious position.</p><p>Within the storm, the situation was even more unpredictable.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something amiss. He abruptly stopped, turning to look into the distance.  An unusually large wave surged towards him, its violent fluctuations causing his heart to clench.  He glimpsed two streaks of light, one red and one white, chasing each other in the air.</p><p>Sensing the auras of the streaks of light, Qin Sang’s expression drastically changed.  Nascent Soul cultivators were fighting nearby!</p>
