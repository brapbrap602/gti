<h1>Chapter 269: The Ten Divine Trees</h1><p>"Brother Qin, recover your breath first. This old man can still persist for a while."</p><p>Yun Youzi urged Qin Sang to recover quickly as he steered the Lingzhu Flying Boat.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved two bottles of Qingling Pill, gave them to Yun Youzi just in case something unexpected happened, and then pressed the Ten Fang Yan Luo Banner against his palm heart. He sat down on the flying boat with his knees crossed and began to heal himself.</p><p>The Fire Spirit Beast pursued them relentlessly, but the Lingzhu Flying Boat was now much faster than when Qin Sang had seen it last. The situation was still under control for the time being.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that once the Jiao Dragon’s essence within the Nine Dragons’ Chariot Talisman was restored, he estimated that he would be able to operate the secret talisman at a speed comparable to the Lingzhu Flying Boat.</p><p>However, the Lingzhu Flying Boat did not seem to consume much spiritual power, whereas the secret talisman consumed a terrifying amount. In that sense, the Nine Dragons’ Chariot Talisman with only one Jiao Dragon’s essence was inferior to the Lingzhu Flying Boat.</p><p>It was evident that the Lingzhu Flying Boat was an extraordinary treasure. With it in his possession, even if Yun Youzi encountered a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he would be able to escape with ease even if he could not defeat them.</p><p>As Qin Sang recovered, he engaged in conversation with Yun Youzi.</p><p>"Senior’s encounter is similar to mine. I wonder what exactly happened in the ancient ruin? The underground cavern suddenly collapsed, and those Fire Spirit Beasts… who knows where they came from?"</p><p>Qin Sang used Yun Youzi’s words to describe his experience as well.</p><p>Yun Youzi sighed. "Before we entered the ancient ruin of the cultivator, several seniors had warned us. Now it seems that something unexpected must have happened up there. If we cannot find a way to escape, we can only go with the flow. No one knows where the magma river leads to. This old man fears most that he will end up trapped in an unknown and dangerous place from which he cannot escape. Fortunately, I encountered Brother Qin. At least we can look out for each other if we encounter danger."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. Yun Youzi was right. It was undoubtedly easier to travel with a companion than to go alone, and Yun Youzi’s Lingzhu Flying Boat was a significant advantage.</p><p>"Senior, have you seen any places where the power of the circular restriction has weakened? It might not have been able to withstand the impact of the tremors and may have developed cracks."</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. "No, I have only explored two places underground once. One was an underground palace inhabited by Fire Birds whose strength was several times that of the Martial Practice Space. I did not dare to go down. The other was this place. Brother Qin, have you encountered something like this?"</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Qin Sang nodded. "To be honest with Senior, when I was in the Martial Practice Space, I happened to be assigned to the lowest row of chains. At the beginning, I did not understand the rules of the trial and went down to take a look. I found that the restriction in the Martial Practice Space was dim and even had cracks, but it was still sturdy at the time. After being impacted by the tremors, it might not be impossible to break it. However, the location of the Martial Practice Space is uncertain."</p><p>Since their top priority was to escape, Qin Sang concocted a reason to inform Yun Youzi of his discovery and discuss it with him.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Yun Youzi’s eyes lit up. After pondering for a moment, he said, "The Martial Practice Space and the ancient ruin of the cultivator appear to be two different spaces, but they are essentially one, separated by a restriction and connected through a stone tablet. It is possible that they are near the stone tablet."</p><p>Qin Sang responded with an affirmative grunt. "This junior shares the same idea."</p><p>"It’s worth a try!"</p><p>Spiritual power surged from Yun Youzi’s body, and the Lingzhu Flying Boat immediately changed direction and charged into a tributary.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the four Lingzhu on the flying boat and asked casually, "Senior, the speed of this bamboo boat is astonishing. What kind of Lingzhu was used to refine it? It’s extraordinary."</p><p>He only asked out of curiosity and did not really expect Yun Youzi to tell him everything without reservation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yun Youzi replied without hesitation, his tone slightly proud. "This bamboo boat is the result of this old man’s painstaking efforts. It is made from four Feiling Bamboo, which this old man obtained by chance. Although this bamboo is inferior to the Ten Divine Trees, it is still a rare type of Lingzhu. It is an extremely light wood. Refining it into a bamboo boat allows it to achieve such speed thanks to this characteristic. During my travels, I have faced many life-threatening situations, and it is all thanks to this bamboo boat that I have survived. Ah… I remember that Brother Qin’s Life-Bound Sword is made from pure wood. Do you need Lingmu to upgrade it?"</p><p>When he saw Qin Sang nod, Yun Youzi hesitated for a moment before saying, "If Brother Qin needs it, I can give you a section of Feiling Bamboo once we escape."</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback and repeatedly waved his hand. "How can I? This bamboo boat is of great importance to Senior. How can I damage it? This junior cannot bear such a heavy debt of gratitude!"</p><p>He had never expected Yun Youzi to be so generous. He had only mentioned it in passing, and yet the other man was willing to give him the Lingzhu.</p><p>It was against etiquette to accept undeserved kindness. Such a valuable gift was given to him for free. He could not accept it and even became a little wary.</p><p>Yun Youzi smiled and explained, "Brother Qin, don’t worry. This bamboo has already been refined into a magic weapon. As long as I don’t damage its source, this old man only needs to recuperate for a few days to replenish what is missing. It will not affect the power of the magic weapon. Of course, the Feiling Bamboo I give you will not be as good as the original and will be similar to ordinary Lingmu. However, it will still retain some of the characteristics of the Feiling Bamboo, which is quite rare."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, but still shook his head in refusal. “Many thanks for your kindness, senior. It’s just a pity that this junior’s Nascent Soul Sword is unique and requires the most pristine spirit wood. The spirit wood that was refined into my Dharma artifact had its spirituality altered, not only unable to advance but the spirit sword will be damaged instead.”</p><p>“So that’s how it is…”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer nodded thoughtfully and consoled him, “Younger Brother Qin, don’t be discouraged, Flying Spirit Bamboo is not the only such wonder in the world. There will always be an opportunity to find a spirit wood of the same level in the future. Younger Brother Qin might even have the chance to obtain one of the Ten Great Divine Trees,  elevating your Nascent Soul Sword into a Dharma treasure.”</p><p>“Senior, you jest. The Ten Great Divine Trees only exist in legends. They are divine objects that even Nascent Soul Sages would covet. This junior has only read about them in ancient books. I don’t even know if there are any Ten Great Divine Trees in this entire Minor Han Region.”</p><p>Qin Sang laughed wryly. Of course he wanted the Ten Great Divine Trees. Even a small section, or even a small piece, would suffice to make it such that he wouldn’t need to worry about his Ebony Sword’s quality before reaching the Core Formation stage.</p><p>But such divine objects were inaccessible and unattainable. In the current era where the cultivation world was declining, it was doubtful whether any of the Ten Great Divine Trees still existed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Cloud Wanderer smiled mysteriously when he heard this. “Younger Brother Qin, you look down too much upon the Minor Han Region and the Ancient Immortals’ Battlefield. From what this old man knows, leaving aside the distant past, the Ten Great Divine Trees have appeared at least three times in the past ten thousand years!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang straightened up and asked in surprise, “The Ancient Immortals’ Battlefield truly contains such a thing? How does senior know this?”</p><p>“This old man also heard it from my master, Daoist Wanderer…”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer explained briefly and then told Qin Sang, “The Ancient Immortals’ Battlefield was formed from the battle between powerful beings in ancient times. In the depths of the battlefield, there are countless spatial rifts and countless dangers, to the point that even Nascent Soul cultivators don’t dare to enter carelessly. There are some immortal estates that have never been explored before. Once they appear, they will be accompanied by countless precious treasures. My master said that in the past ten thousand years, there have been three confirmed instances of the appearance of one of the Ten Great Divine Trees. It’s just that very few were qualified to participate in the struggle for it, so the news didn’t spread widely and few people know about it.</p><p>Chapter 269: The Ten Great Sacred Trees</p><p>“Brother Qin, focus on recovering first. This old Daoist can still hold on for a while.”</p><p>Yun Youzi urged Qin Sang to recover quickly as he steered the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat.</p><p>Qin Sang took out two bottles of Green Spirit Pills and handed them to Yun Youzi in case of emergencies.  He discreetly gripped the Ten Yama Banners in his palm and sat cross-legged on the flying boat, beginning to meditate.</p><p>The fire spirits pursued them relentlessly, but the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat was even faster than the last time Qin Sang had seen it.  The situation was tenuously stable.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly relied on the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman. Once the Jiao Dragon spirit within it recovered, he estimated its speed would at most be comparable to the flying boat.</p><p>However, the flying boat seemed to consume little spiritual energy, while the talisman's consumption was astonishing.  From this perspective, the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, with only one Jiao Dragon spirit, was inferior to the flying boat.</p><p>It was evident how extraordinary the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat was. With this treasure, even if Yun Youzi couldn't defeat a Foundation Establishment cultivator, escaping wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>While recovering, Qin Sang started a conversation with Yun Youzi.</p><p>“My experience is similar to yours, Senior. I don't know what happened in the legacy ruins. The caverns suddenly collapsed, and those fire spirits appeared out of nowhere…”</p><p>Qin Sang echoed Yun Youzi's account.</p><p>Yun Youzi sighed. “Before entering the ancient cultivator’s ruins, several seniors warned us. Now it seems something must have happened above. If we can't find a way out, we can only drift along. No one knows where the River of Magma ultimately leads. This old Daoist fears being stranded alone in some unknown dangerous place, unable to escape. Fortunately, I met Brother Qin.  At least we can look out for each other in times of danger.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. Yun Youzi was right. Two people were better than one, and Yun Youzi's flying boat was a significant advantage.</p><p>“Senior, have you encountered any locations where the circular restrictions have weakened? Perhaps they couldn't withstand the tremors and have cracked.”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. “No, I’ve only explored underground twice. Once was an underground palace filled with firebirds several times stronger than those in the Trial Space. I didn't dare go down there. The second time was this one. Have you encountered any, Brother Qin?”</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang nodded. “To be honest, Senior, when I was in the Trial Space, I happened to be assigned to the lowest chain.  At first, I didn't understand the rules of the trial and went down to take a look.  I found that the restrictive formations in the Trial Space were dim, and there were even cracks on them. Although they were still strong then, after the tremors, they might be breakable.  However… I'm not sure where the Trial Space is located.”</p><p>Escaping was the priority. Qin Sang found a reason to share his discovery with Yun Youzi to discuss it together.</p><p>Hearing this, Yun Youzi's eyes lit up. He pondered, “The Trial Space and the ancient cultivator's ruins seem to be two separate spaces, but they are essentially one, separated by restrictions and connected by the stone stele. It might be near the stele.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement. "That's what I thought as well.”</p><p>“It’s worth a try!”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s spiritual energy flashed, and the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat immediately changed direction, rushing into a tributary.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down at the four spirit bamboos on the flying boat and casually asked, “Senior, this bamboo boat is astonishingly fast.  What kind of spirit bamboo is it made of? It’s quite extraordinary.”</p><p>He only asked casually, not really expecting Yun Youzi to explain everything.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yun Youzi didn’t hesitate and said with some pride, “This flying boat is this old Daoist's proudest creation. It's made from four stalks of Flying Spirit Bamboo, which I obtained by chance. Although this bamboo is not one of the Ten Great Sacred Trees, it’s a rare spirit bamboo, known for being extremely light. After refining it into a flying boat, this characteristic gives it such speed.  I’ve faced many life-threatening situations during my travels, and it was this boat that saved me. Oh… I remember Brother Qin’s natal spirit sword is a pure wood embryo. Do you need spirit wood to enhance it?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang nod, Yun Youzi hesitated for a moment, then said, “Brother Qin, if you need it, I can give you a section of Flying Spirit Bamboo after we escape this danger.”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned and waved his hands repeatedly. “How can I accept this? This flying boat is so important to you, Senior.  How can I damage it? I don't deserve such a generous gift!”</p><p>He never expected Yun Youzi to be so generous, offering such a precious gift after a casual conversation. He really didn’t dare to accept it, and even felt a bit wary.</p><p>Yun Youzi smiled and explained, “Don’t worry, Brother Qin. This bamboo has already been refined into a magical tool. As long as its essence isn’t damaged, this old Daoist only needs to nurture it for a few days to replenish the missing part. It won't affect the tool’s power. Of course, the separated Flying Spirit Bamboo won’t be as good as the original. It will be similar to ordinary spirit wood, but it will still retain some of the Flying Spirit Bamboo’s characteristics, which is quite rare.”</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood, but still shook his head and refused, "Thank you for your kindness, Senior. Unfortunately, my natal spirit sword is special. It requires the most primordial spirit wood. Refined spirit wood has altered spirituality, not only unable to improve it, but actually harmful to the spirit sword."</p><p>"I see…"</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded thoughtfully and consoled him, "Brother Qin, don't be discouraged. Flying Spirit Bamboo is not the only unique marvel in the world. You will eventually find spirit wood of the same level in the future. Perhaps you'll have the chance to obtain one of the Ten Sacred Trees and elevate your natal spirit sword to the level of a magical treasure in one fell swoop."</p><p>"Senior, please don't tease me. The Ten Sacred Trees only exist in legends. They are divine objects that even Nascent Soul ancestors covet. I've only seen them in ancient texts.  I don't even know if any exist in the entire Small Cold Region."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a wry smile. Of course, he desired the Ten Sacred Trees.  Not even a whole section, but even a small piece would suffice to eliminate his worries about the Ebony Sword's quality before reaching the Core Formation stage.</p><p>But such divine objects were a matter of chance, not something one could actively seek. With the decline of the cultivation world today, the very existence of the Ten Sacred Trees was questionable.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, Yun Youzi gave a mysterious smile, "Brother Qin, you underestimate the Small Cold Region and the Ancient Battlefield.  From what I know, let's not even talk about distant occurrences, within the last ten thousand years, the Ten Sacred Trees have appeared at least three times!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang straightened up and asked in surprise, "Do they really exist in the Ancient Battlefield? How do you know, Senior?"</p><p>"I also heard it from my master, Realist Piaoya…"</p><p>Yun Youzi explained briefly, then began to elaborate for Qin Sang, "The Ancient Battlefield was formed from the great battles of ancient mighty figures. Deep within the battlefield, spatial rifts are dense and dangers abound. Even Nascent Soul cultivators dare not trespass. There are some immortal abodes that have never been explored.  Whenever one appears, it is accompanied by countless rare treasures. My master said that within the last ten thousand years, the Ten Sacred Trees have indeed appeared three times. However, only a few were qualified to compete for them, so the news didn't spread widely and remained largely unknown." </p>
