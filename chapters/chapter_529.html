<h1>Chapter 522 Astral and Earthly Essence Clash</h1><p>Hearing Shi Ying's words, Qin Sang was both amused and exasperated. However, he quickly cleared his mind, closed off his senses, and focused his spirit on his Qi Sea, not daring to be the slightest bit distracted.</p><p>Shi Ying was extremely nervous, and how could he not be?</p><p>Shi Ying couldn't help much; everything depended on Qin Sang himself.</p><p>It was his own Dantian that was about to face the impact. If anything went wrong, Shi Ying would at most be affected and injured, while he himself would have his Qi Sea foundation destroyed, and whether he could even survive was uncertain.</p><p>In the quiet cave, the blue Demonic Fire flickered.</p><p>The sliver of Azure Yang Astral Essence that had been cut off was already floating near Qin Sang's Dantian.</p><p>At this moment, a vortex suddenly appeared at Qin Sang's Dantian. Within the vortex, spiritual power and Earthly Sha Qi intertwined, appearing gray.</p><p>Just then, Shi Ying's movements paused slightly.</p><p>She first checked the Azure Yang Astral Essence, confirming that it showed no signs of collapsing. Then she looked at Qin Sang, confirming that the corpse refinement was still completely obedient.</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Shi Ying lightly bit her red lip, steeled her resolve, and abruptly pushed the Azure Yang Astral Essence into the vortex!</p><p>At this instant, Qin Sang made direct contact with Azure Yang Astral Essence for the first time.</p><p>To his surprise, the legendary supremely Yang Astral Qi, a wondrous substance on par with Earthly Sha Qi, was unexpectedly gentle and peaceful, like a drop of nectar dripping into his Qi Sea, soft and smooth as solidified fat.</p><p>Was Azure Yang Astral Essence inherently like this, or was it because it had transformed into Astral Condensation that it had this appearance?</p><p>Qin Sang's doubts didn't last long.</p><p>After the Azure Yang Astral Essence entered the vortex, Shi Ying suddenly withdrew the enveloping Azure Yang Demonic Fire. In an instant, freed from its restraints, the Azure Yang Astral Essence finally revealed its true nature!</p><p>The originally docile Azure Yang Astral Essence suddenly burst into motion. Before Qin Sang and Shi Ying could react, it fiercely pierced into Qin Sang's Qi Sea.</p><p>It wasn't a mere sliver of blue light; it was a bolt of blue lightning, carrying an extremely violent aura, revealing its ferocious fangs!</p><p>The sudden change shocked Shi Ying.</p><p>Although she cultivated Azure Yang Demonic Fire, her understanding of Azure Yang Astral Essence was limited. These disciples simply followed the cultivation method, practicing step by step.</p><p>To delve into the essence of Azure Yang Astral Essence, she would probably have to wait until after forming her Gold Core.</p><p>The sudden change in the Azure Yang Astral Essence was unforeseen by Shi Ying.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart also tightened abruptly. Such a minuscule sliver of Azure Yang Astral Essence could actually unleash such terrifying power. At this moment, he had the feeling that his Qi Sea was about to be pierced through, and instinctively wanted to expel the Azure Yang Astral Essence with all his might.</p><p>However, he quickly suppressed his instinct, his spirit locking onto his Qi Sea.</p><p>No matter how strong the Azure Yang Astral Essence was, its quantity was too small. Shi Ying had brought very little out of the mountain, and this was only a portion of it. Half of his Qi Sea was Earthly Sha Qi, so at worst, it wouldn't be destroyed by the Azure Yang Astral Essence.</p><p>As long as he stabilized the Earthly Sha Qi, he could take control of the situation in time.</p><p>"Why did the Azure Yang Astral Essence suddenly erupt?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>The fluctuations from Shi Ying's soul mark let Qin Sang know that Shi Ying was also shocked by the change, indicating that this behavior of the Azure Yang Astral Essence was not normal.</p><p>Indeed, that was the case.</p><p>Back at Astral Peak, when Shi Ying failed to seal the Azure Yang Astral Essence, it simply dissipated silently. This kind of change was the first time it had occurred.</p><p>"There's only one reason. It sensed the Earthly Sha Qi within my body..."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he realized the reason.</p><p>Earthly Sha Qi and Azure Yang Astral Qi, one Yin and one Yang, were both renowned wondrous substances. It wasn't strange that they would clash and oppose each other upon encountering one another.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang thought of a solution.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang could take action, his Qi Sea also lost control along with the Azure Yang Astral Essence. The Earthly Sha Qi surged,掀起一道巨浪, fiercely rushing towards the Azure Yang Astral Essence.</p><p>Just as he thought!</p><p>This scene confirmed Qin Sang's guess, but he didn't feel any excitement, his mind tense and extremely nervous, doing his utmost to restrain the Earthly Sha Qi.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang reacted quickly, he was still a step too slow, too late.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>In an instant, the supremely Yin Sha Qi and the supremely Yang Astral Qi, two incredibly violent wondrous substances, fiercely collided.</p><p>Turbulent waves arose within the Qi Sea.</p><p>The barrier formed by the Five Elements Yin objects also vibrated incessantly under the explosive impact, helping to stabilize the Qi Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was in his throat, staring intently at his Gold Core.</p><p>His Qi Sea fluctuated, the Gold Core suspended in the center, like the moon in water, waxing and waning in the turbulence.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang's mind eased slightly.</p><p>Fortunately, fortunately, the amount of Azure Yang Astral Essence was small. Facing so much Earthly Sha Qi, it was annihilated without any resistance, the conflict quickly subsided, and the power was manageable, not shaking his foundation.</p><p>The Gold Core was not significantly affected and remained stable.</p><p>With the Azure Yang Astral Essence eliminated, the Earthly Sha Qi finally settled down, and Qin Sang's Qi Sea gradually returned to calm. From the outside, it seemed as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Outside, Shi Ying's face had turned pale with fright. She remained stunned for a good while. Seeing that Qin Sang was still sitting in meditation, she suddenly came back to her senses and hurriedly checked Qin Sang's condition.</p><p>Confirming that Qin Sang had not been harmed in the conflict, Shi Ying let out a long breath, realizing that her back was soaked with cold sweat.</p><p>The conflict had been very brief and confined to Qin Sang's Qi Sea, but the power displayed in that instant was terrifying. Recalling the scene, she still felt lingering fear.</p><p>Fortunately, she had been cautious and taken only a portion of the Azure Yang Astral Essence for the test.</p><p>Shi Ying secretly rejoiced. Her gaze fell on Qin Sang's Qi Sea. After hesitating for a moment, she decided to continue the test.</p><p>The previous scene seemed dangerous, but it completely matched the description in the secret method. The Corpse Refinement's own power could handle the unexpected situation, which reassured Shi Ying.</p><p>She 'commanded' Qin Sang to recover, and she also took out a spirit pill and consumed it, holding a spirit stone to quickly adjust her breath.</p><p>She was now wealthy. Before obtaining the legacy of the Foundation Establishment Demonic Cultivator, she wouldn't have dared to be so extravagant.</p><p>Soon, Shi Ying adjusted her state to its peak. Seeing that Qin Sang hadn't finished yet, she sat on the ground waiting, staring at Qin Sang in a daze and talking to herself.</p><p>"Brother Corpse Refinement, when you recover, we'll continue trying, striving to complete your transformation as soon as possible...</p><p>"Before I met you, I had already lost all hope, thinking I would never be able to avenge my parents. It was you who gave me hope...</p><p>"I don't seek the Immortal Path or longevity. I live only for revenge.</p><p>"Don't worry, after I take my revenge, I will definitely keep my promise and find a way to unlock the seal on your Primordial Spirit..."</p><p>Shi Ying had never dared to tell anyone her innermost thoughts. Suppressed for far too long, she thought Qin Sang was inanimate and treated him as a confidant.</p><p>Unconsciously, she poured out all her heart's words.</p><p>In the light green cave, her eyes also sparkled, containing deep hope and a desperate determination.</p>
