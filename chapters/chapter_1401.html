<h1>Chapter 1393: Black Swamp</h1><p>Seeing these silken threads,</p><p>Qin Sang paused in his movements, his expression becoming even more solemn.</p><p>Then,</p><p>he tried to pluck one of the threads.</p><p>At first, nothing seemed amiss.</p><p>Inside the cave, the Ice Box emitted a faint glow, reflecting Qin Sang's serious face.</p><p>After a while,</p><p>a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Without warning, the Ice Box trembled violently, erupting with blinding white light, and an extremely savage surge of energy burst forth, following Qin Sang's power, and retaliated.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his hackles rise; an alarming premonition stirred within him. His face changed slightly, and he quickly withdrew his hand.</p><p>The Ice Box gradually returned to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the Ice Box, recalling the mysterious power he had just felt. Then he discovered that the seal on the Ice Box had changed.</p><p>The new sealing power was completely different from the previous one.</p><p>All his efforts had been in vain.</p><p>"This isâ€¦ a double safeguard left by the Profound Sky Palace to prevent others from stealing the treasure and breaking the seal?"</p><p>Qin Sang faintly guessed.</p><p>He was silent for a moment before attempting again, but the result was still the same.</p><p>The sealing power on the Ice Box was extremely strong, unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen. Coupled with this sudden change, breaking the seal became even more difficult.</p><p>Even if he managed to break the seal with great difficulty, there was no guarantee that the power wouldn't undergo further changes.</p><p>The Profound Sky Palace had truly gone to great lengths (had truly racked their brains).</p><p>It would be futile to try and open the Ice Box in a short time.</p><p>"If Bai Zai were here, he might have a way to deal with these strange and bizarre things."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned deeply.</p><p>Reluctantly, Qin Sang was about to put away the Ice Box when he suddenly thought of something.</p><p>"The Profound Sky Palace values this treasure so much; would they only have this one safeguard?"</p><p>Hesitating for a moment,</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred. A Fire Lotus Seed flew out from between his eyebrows, and a wisp of demonic flame separated from it, transforming into a dense fire net that adhered to the surface of the Ice Box.</p><p>The Ice Box became a Fire Box.</p><p>Qin Sang added a layer of Demonic Flame Seal on the surface of the Ice Box, using the aura of the demonic flame to isolate the Ice Box.</p><p>This was all he could do.</p><p>"Before opening the Ice Box, it's best not to go to the Hidden Sun Realm."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, putting away the Ice Box, and then took out the Fallen Phoenix Jade and the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>In Qin Sang's estimation, refining the Golden Sinking Sword would require two more spiritual objects with specific attributes. The Fallen Phoenix Jade met the requirements, and its quality was higher than the spiritual object Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>If he couldn't wait, he could try refining it now.</p><p>However, this refinement would push the Golden Sinking Sword to the peak grade, which would be a test for both the magic weapon and the refiner.</p><p>If he failed, it might even damage the main body of the magic weapon.</p><p>Out of caution, he decided to wait a little longer.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang remained stationed on Hunting Chen Island.</p><p>Outside,</p><p>the human and demon races waged a fierce war.</p><p>The flames of war soared, even spreading to the Star Sand Islands.</p><p>Both races suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>Blood stained the ocean red, and countless corpses and limbs drifted along the currents, everywhere. The demons were especially numerous.</p><p>The victor was decided in just a few months.</p><p>Even though the demon race was defeated in the end, Bifang hardly showed his face on the battlefield, confirming Qin Sang's speculation. Although the Cunning Fox and other demons invited some helpers, they couldn't resist the human race's offensive, suffering heavy losses and fleeing back to the demon territory with their remaining forces in disarray.</p><p>The demon beasts entrenched between the Star Sand Islands and the Crescent Moon Realm were basically wiped out, and the sea routes were restored and became increasingly prosperous.</p><p>Qin Sang also befriended several fellow cultivators from the Star Sand Islands.</p><p>After the war ended,</p><p>Qin Sang attended the celebration banquet held by Venerable Feng on Wind Yang Mountain.</p><p>He had personally experienced several battles.</p><p>Those demon kings, seeing the situation was bad, fled quickly.</p><p>He failed to kill any demon kings, but he plundered many treasures from the demon kings' caves and added them to the Thousand Jun Ring. When he had the chance, he would participate in more trading fairs and auctions to purchase the spiritual objects he needed to improve the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>A month later,</p><p>two streaks of light flew out of Wind Yang Mountain, heading south.</p><p>It was Qin Sang and Venerable Feng.</p><p>"I appreciate Venerable Feng accompanying me on this trip," Qin Sang thanked.</p><p>Venerable Feng smiled and said, "I was just about to say that I've kept you waiting. Thanks to Fellow Cultivator's righteous assistance, we were able to drive away the Cunning Fox and other demons so quickly. Otherwise, if it had been delayed, and they had invited a Demon Saint, there would have been unforeseen changes. Moreover, Feng is going to visit an old friend in the Southern Realm, and it just so happens that we're passing by Hundred Flowers Valley."</p><p>"I heard that Hundred Flowers Valley is very low-key, and even outsiders can't find the entrance to their sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang did not place all his hopes on Venerable Feng alone.</p><p>During this time, he took every opportunity to inquire about news of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley was very famous, and the cultivators of the Star Sand Islands all knew about it.</p><p>In fact, being the number one in insect manipulation wasn't much, but their unique talent was widely known.</p><p>There weren't many cultivators in the cultivation world who specialized in insect manipulation.</p><p>Raising spiritual insects was slow, and most cultivators were unwilling to spend their energy on it. Most of those who raised spiritual insects had accidentally encountered a spiritual insect with strange abilities and kept it as a tool.</p><p>Qin Sang stole the Wu Clan's secret technique of natal insect Gu and used essence blood to cultivate the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. The cultivation speed was faster than other spiritual insects, but it was still too slow compared to cultivators.</p><p>Furthermore, he had no clue how to break through in the future.</p><p>Of course, the Wu Clan's inheritance was definitely more than that, but Qin Sang's cultivation level wasn't high enough at the time to access it.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't go back.</p><p>Venerable Feng 'ummed' and said, "I heard Fellow Cultivator Mu say that it seems to be the ancestral teaching of Hundred Flowers Valley, that unless they are provoked, they will never actively participate in the disputes of the cultivation world, but rather close their doors and tend to flowers and manipulate insects. Many people have heard that Hundred Flowers Valley is near Blackwater Bay, but they can't find the sect's entrance."</p><p>The Fellow Cultivator Mu he spoke of was the current Valley Master of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Blackwater Bay was near the central part of Crescent Moon Island, on the eastern coast.</p><p>Adjacent to Blackwater Bay on land was a Black Swamp that almost ran through the entire Crescent Moon Island, dividing the Crescent Moon Island into two parts, known as the Southern and Northern Realms.</p><p>The Black Swamp emitted a foul odor and was extremely dangerous inside. Most parts were not suitable for cultivation.</p><p>There were few cultivation sects here.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley built its sect here, facing little pressure.</p><p>"This kind of sect is truly rare."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Withdrawing from the world and avoiding conflict was just a beautiful vision in the cultivation world.</p><p>Venerable Feng thought for a moment and said, "When I was chatting with Fellow Cultivator Mu, I occasionally heard a few words. The founder of Hundred Flowers Valley seemed to be from the Boundless Sea. Alone, she traveled thousands of miles to establish a sect in the Crescent Moon Realm, without any support. That's probably why they don't want to be involved in the local cultivators' disputes. Fortunately, Hundred Flowers Valley has always been strong, and with the Black Swamp as a buffer, they have been able to maintain their detached status."</p><p>After a pause, Venerable Feng added, "The reason why Hundred Flowers Valley is so famous is because they regard insect manipulation as their fundamental inheritance. In fact, there are some other forces that are proficient in the art of insect manipulation as a supplementary skill, such as Star Mountain, Thousand Saliva Alliance, and so on. However, Feng has no friendship with them, so he can't introduce them to you."</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him.</p><p>He had already inquired about the forces that Venerable Feng mentioned. "Thank you for the reminder, Fellow Daoist. This poor Daoist has the intention to visit them one by one after leaving Hundred Flowers Valley."</p><p>Venerable Feng nodded and talked about some content related to Hundred Flowers Valley, mostly rumors and anecdotes, not involving real secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang kept them in mind.</p>
