<h1>Chapter 1224: Agreement Reached (Extra chapter for the alliance leader, Wang Duoyu!)</h1><p>Xiang Qing’s face turned pale.</p><p>Shen Gang Peak was the foundation of the Qingyang Demon Sect.  His arrangements, made to maintain order and prevent exploitation by outsiders, had been seen through at a glance.</p><p>Bing Han’s eyes lit up. “Daoist also excels in fire control techniques?”</p><p>“Indeed,” Qin Sang nodded. “This Daoist has some understanding of this path.”</p><p>Xiang Qing’s expression shifted, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang for a long time before he coldly snorted, “Since it’s a trade, what do you want?”</p><p>“This Daoist only wishes to take a portion of the Ancestral Sacred Flame. Daoist Xiang should understand that right now, the Ancestral Sacred Flame is more harmful than beneficial to you; it’s a mere chicken bone.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was sincere.</p><p>Bing Han’s eyes flickered, silent, lost in thought.</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Flame was left by the Qingyang Demon Sect’s founding ancestor. Only Xiang Qing could make the decision; she couldn't overstep her bounds.</p><p>A sneer played on Xiang Qing’s lips. “Just taking the Ancestral Sacred Flame? Since Daoist can see through the grand formation, you should know how terrifying the power contained within the Ancestral Sacred Flame is, right? Otherwise, it wouldn't have fallen to you. Even taking only a portion would allow your strength to leap several levels.”</p><p>Qin Sang frankly admitted, “It's a mutually beneficial exchange. This Daoist also risks being backlashed by the spiritual fire.  I wouldn't work for Daoist for nothing, would I?”</p><p>Xiang Qing paced back and forth, unexpectedly refusing, much to Qin Sang's surprise.</p><p>“Even if the Qingyang Demon Sect and Shen Gang Peak are destroyed together, Xiang will not aid the enemy! If Daoist wishes to trade, be upfront!”</p><p>Bing Han was also quite surprised, but she didn't believe a Yuan Ying cultivator would appear out of nowhere, curiously observing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, “I fear that if I reveal my true form, Daoist Xiang will not agree.”</p><p>As he spoke, a green light shone from Qin Sang, and a pair of exquisitely beautiful phoenix wings suddenly unfolded from his back.  A deep look of astonishment appeared in Bing Han’s eyes.</p><p>“Bright Moon Demon King?”</p><p>Xiang Qing exclaimed, his face full of shock.</p><p>Bing Han suddenly understood. “So that’s it. I heard that Daoist wields twelve fire banners, possibly modeled after the Kui Yin Ancestor’s Ten Directions Yama Banners, with two extra ones. I originally thought that, like the Kui Yin Ancestor, you sealed the spiritual fire within a treasure and couldn't directly control it. Now it seems that Daoist can personally control the spiritual fire, which is why you can easily wield so many banners.”</p><p>She seemed to have specifically studied Qin Sang’s twelve demonic banners.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't reveal the embarrassing truth about cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, and simply nodded in agreement, saying to Xiang Qing, “Back then, before I transformed, I was inconvenient to move, so I used some small tricks to deceive a few scattered cultivators into forming the Demon Flame Sect for my use.  Unexpectedly, they made a name for themselves. Since there's some connection, I want to take them back under my wing.  Daoist Xiang won't mind, will you?”</p><p>Xiang Qing gave a wry smile. “Daoist disguised yourself as a human, with no trace of demonic aura. I never imagined it was you. Daoist has aided our alliance of the two realms significantly. Just speak plainly, there's no need for this roundabout way.”</p><p>“I want to use the Ancestral Sacred Flame to refine my fire banners for easier control later. I was worried that because of the differences between humans and demons, you two would have reservations.”</p><p>Qin Sang stated his prepared words, thinking, *What if you’ve already solved your problem and reject my proposal, and I've already exposed my intentions? How will I make plans in the future?*</p><p>“I heard that Daoist’s twelve fire banners are comparable to top-grade treasures. Can they be improved even further?”</p><p>Bing Han exclaimed, covering her mouth.</p><p>Xiang Qing was also secretly shocked, becoming more wary of Qin Sang and the demon realm, wondering if his actions in helping the demons improve their strength was the right choice.</p><p>However, in terms of overall strength, the demon race was far inferior to the human race, and could only stay in a corner.</p><p>The biggest conflict in the current cultivation world wasn't the conflict between races, but the Abyss of Sin. Qin Sang stationed himself at Three-Tier Pass, first slaying an Abyss of Sin Yuan Ying cultivator, and then entering the Abyssal Ruins, bringing back news of Blood Lake. At least for now, they are still allies.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang said something that made it impossible for him to refuse,  “The journey to Blood Lake is imminent, and I am also preparing for Blood Lake. In the unknown lands of Blood Lake, facing Elder Ye, no matter how cautious we are, it's not enough; I dare not guarantee everything will be alright.  Wouldn't Daoist Xiang want to resolve your concerns before departure?”</p><p>This hit Xiang Qing’s weakness.</p><p>He knew how difficult it was to cultivate a Yuan Ying cultivator. If he died before suppressing the Ancestral Sacred Flame, it would be impossible for his successors to suppress it.</p><p>It was foreseeable that they would be forced to relocate their sect.</p><p>Losing the inexhaustible Qingyang Divine Gang from Shen Gang Peak, unless the Qingyang Demon Sect found a new source, their inheritance would cease.</p><p>Xiang Qing, a decisive person, didn't let Qin Sang waste more words. He agreed to let Qin Sang try, provided Qin Sang swore not to cause trouble.</p><p>Bing Han clasped her hands and smiled, "My palace and Daoist Xiang have racked our brains, but we haven't been able to suppress the Ancestor Saint Flame. Let's see Daoist Mingyue's abilities."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded.</p><p>Refining the Ancestor Saint Flame and cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" was the only option now.  He was relieved to have reached an agreement so quickly.</p><p>The three acted swiftly. After finishing their drinks, Xiang Qing took Qin Sang flying up to the Divine Gang Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang had once refined a piece of Gang Jade, triggering the formation and nearly causing the Ancestor Saint Flame to go out of control.</p><p>This time, he was very careful, listening to Xiang Qing's explanations and observing to deepen his understanding.</p><p>They flew to the peak.</p><p>Xiang Qing raised his hand, and a ball of Qingyang Demon Fire gathered in his palm, forming a fire seal that struck the formation. The green mist parted, revealing a narrow passage.</p><p>Qin Sang observed Xiang Qing's control of the Qingyang Demon Fire. It was different from his own manipulation of demon fire through the demon banner.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Fire was like a part of Xiang Qing's body, already integrated with him, without the slightest separation.</p><p>"I should be able to do this too, once I cultivate the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus'," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Deep within the formation, the sight startled Qin Sang.</p><p>Green mist filled the sky.</p><p>Within the green mist, there was a complex formation entirely constructed from Qingyang Gang Jade, shaped like a square jade platform.</p><p>Above the platform, a flame danced – the Ancestor Saint Flame.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Ancestor Saint Flame's true form was humanoid, like a sentient spiritual flame.  Its limbs and features were visible, though it was only half a person's height.</p><p>Xiang Qing said, "Don't be misled by appearances, Daoist. The Ancestor Saint Flame is not a living creature. It became humanoid due to the lingering aura of the ancestor and subsequent changes."</p><p>"Daoist Xiang cultivates the same origin technique. Your sect also has secret arts for refining and cultivating fire seeds. Couldn't you directly subdue the Ancestor Saint Flame?" Qin Sang asked, voicing his doubts.</p><p>Xiang Qing sighed, "Perhaps it could have been done when the ancestor had just fallen. Now it's too late. The Ancestor Saint Flame was sealed by the ancestor at the top of Divine Gang Peak.  Unexpectedly, it was able to directly absorb the ambient Qingyang Gang Qi and other auras, changing its nature and becoming increasingly volatile.  Over time, by the time our ancestors noticed something was wrong, it was impossible to reverse it, and they could only let the Ancestor Saint Flame develop. The current Ancestor Saint Flame is completely different from the spiritual flame the ancestor left behind. Even with my Yuan Ying cultivation, I wouldn't dare act rashly... What are your chances, Daoist?"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Sorry for the delay. I will be even busier these next few days, but I've caught up now.</p>
