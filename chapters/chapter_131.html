<h1>Chapter 124, Secret Art of Corpse Dan</h1><p>The cave was clean but furnished in a warm style that resembled a rich lady’s boudoir in the mortal world. Even some of the furniture adorned in a similar fashion.</p><p>In the deepest part of the cave, there was a small jade pool. Spiritual mist gathered above the jade pool. Below it was a tiny spring. Half of the pool was filled with spring water.</p><p>Like a clear spring, this was a sign that the spiritual eye was about to transform into a spring.</p><p>The quality of this spiritual eye exceeded Qin Sang’s expectations. Even at Mount Shaohua, not many caves could compare to it. It was an excellent cave.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly nodded his head. Having obtained this cave, the speed of his future cultivation would be increased by 10%. Don’t underestimate this value. A small increase could accumulate and perhaps be the key to breaking through the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Seeing that it was a spiritual eye, Qin Sang threw the jade slip containing the《Spirit Hiding Art》to the white cat.</p><p>The white cat took a look and sat quietly for a while before suddenly waving her front paws to discharge several wisps of spiritual power. In the void, they condensed into several mysterious runes.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The runes entered the white cat’s body.</p><p>At that moment, her body’s spiritual power suddenly introverted while her demonic energy also weakened. She could completely conceal her demonic energy once she became proficient in the《Spirit Hiding Art》.</p><p>The《Spirit Hiding Art》was really effective. The white cat was overjoyed. She stood up and bowed to Qin Sang. “Thank you for gifting me this art, Mister Qin. I will now gift you the art for activating the cave’s array.”</p><p>After speaking, the white cat took out a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang. She then glanced at her cave with lingering affection and put away all her belongings as a keepsake. Immediately, she bid farewell to Qin Sang.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the white cat was leaving so resolutely. Qin Sang saw her out of the cave.</p><p>The sunset’s afterglow, the clouds were vast.</p><p>Qin Sang watched as the white cat walked on the water to the west. Her small figure disappeared at the end of the water expanse. He said silently: I only hope that you can safely arrive at the Heaven Demon Mound and attain what you wish for.</p><p>After returning to the cave, Qin Sang began considering how to furnish his newly acquired cave.</p><p>He did not care about enjoyment, only sought a place where he could rest.</p><p>The cave was now just the right size. It was enough to place the Water Heart Bamboo cushion and some necessary items. There was no need to expand it further.</p><p>The only problem was that the cave’s array did not have strong defensive capabilities. The array left by the bamboo yao could only seal off the spiritual eye’s spiritual energy and prevent it from escaping. Then it would close the array and conceal the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang walked around the cave several times and flew around the island, examining it for a long time. Finally, he carefully inspected the surroundings within a hundred-mile radius. He discovered that the spiritual energy around the island was very thin. The neighboring small islands were also similar barren islands, covered in weeds without any spiritual aura.</p><p>Even if a cultivator flew overhead, they would never expect that there would be a spiritual eye inside such a desolate place. They would not even bother to look at it.</p><p>Coupled with the array’s concealment, the cave was not easily discovered unless a powerful Grandmaster searched it carefully with their spiritual sense.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang still decided to find a powerful defensive array when he had the opportunity and set it up around the cave. This place was already in the Vast Mist Marsh. There was a mix of good and bad here, unlike under Mount Shaohua. There was no guarantee that nothing unexpected would happen.</p><p>He tidied up the cave with his blood blade and then cleaned it. This cave would likely accompany him for a very long time. Qin Sang placed his usual items and looked around. For some reason, he felt a sense of warmth, a feeling of ‘home’.</p><p>After cleaning, Qin Sang woke up the unconscious Gu Yuan. Gu Yuan’s bones were not that hard. After Qin Sang disciplined him a few times, he said whatever he was asked. After asking all he needed to know, Qin Sang gave Gu Yuan a swift death. He sat cross-legged on the cushion, picked up the jade slip in his hand, and flipped through it, deep in thought.</p><p>Combining the contents of the art in the jade slip and Gu Yuan’s testimony, Qin Sang basically understood the ins and outs of 《Corpse Dan Secret Art》.</p><p>《Corpse Dan Secret Art》 was divided into two parts. One part was the method of refining a corpse dan, the blood heart dan; the second part was how to refine the blood heart dan and benefit oneself.</p><p>First, let a person cultivate the first part of the art. Let him devour mortals and refine corpse evil energy. In this process, the corpse energy would affect him. His body and primordial spirit would mutate.</p><p>This evil technique used this person’s physical body as a furnace, his corpse evil energy as fire, and refined this person and the essence contained within the souls and blood food he had devoured into a blood heart dan.</p><p>Even if someone who cultivated this evil technique had good intentions in the beginning and could resist the temptation of not harming innocent mortals, they would eventually be eroded by the evil technique, going insane from the irresistible desire.</p><p>Instincts would compel them to devour flesh and blood, losing all self-control when they descended into madness.</p><p>Without the white cat demon watching over them, Hei Wa, despite his formidable willpower, would find resisting unbearable. The mortals within the cave had long since been meals in his stomach.</p><p>Individuals cultivating the Corpse Pellet Secret Technique could ingest Bloodheart Pills to fortify their vitality, strengthening their bodies to enhance their abilities and extend their lives.</p><p>Of course, ingesting Bloodheart Pills came at a price. Once they began taking them, they could no longer stop, and they needed a ceaseless supply to replenish their reserves.</p><p>Furthermore, Bloodheart Pills contained lingering Corpse Fiend Qi. While the bodies of those who took the pills would grow more robust, their bodies would begin undergoing strange, irreversible changes as the Corpse Fiend Qi within them accumulated, extinguishing any possibility of breaking through to a higher realm.</p><p>Without the Bloodheart Pills, or if they were unable to suppress the Corpse Fiend Qi within them, they would immediately transform into mindless, monstrous corpses akin to the state Gu Tiannan had ended up in.</p><p>It was only after the master and disciple began cultivating the Corpse Pellet Secret Technique that they realized how inseparable they had become from the Bloodheart Pills. They had sunk deeper and deeper, and in order to conceal themselves from Mount Shaohua, they had devised their pernicious baiting scheme.</p><p>They had not limited their wickedness to the country of Gu Yuan, but their masterful acting and低调 behavior meant that they always retreated when they had benefited sufficiently. Furthermore, their affiliation with Mount Shaohua and their identities as disciples of the Eight Sects of Orthodoxy had shielded them from suspicion.</p><p>Once he learned the true nature of the Corpse Pellet Secret Technique, Qin Sang had lost all interest in it.</p><p>The Jade Buddha could only safeguard his Primordial Spirit, preventing his spiritual faculties from being compromised, but it was incapable of obstructing the Corpse Fiend Qi from eroding his body, unless he could locate another Jade Buddha capable of protecting his flesh.</p><p>The consequences of being unable to establish a foundation were unacceptable.</p><p>Discarding the Corpse Pellet Secret Technique, Qin Sang casually began cultivating the Escapist Spirit Method.</p><p>Internalizing his aura did not amount to truly concealing his cultivation. If someone's cultivation far surpassed his own, they would still be able to penetrate the disguise. It had little value to him now, but it might prove useful in the future.</p><p>Seated on the Water Heart Bamboo Cushion, he circulated the cultivation technique, practicing for a while. To his delight, his cultivation speed was indeed several times faster than before.</p><p>A smile passed over Qin Sang's face involuntarily as he organized the belongings of the master and disciple, considering how he would report this matter to Uncle Wen. Then, he sealed the cave and returned to Mount Shaohua, bearing Gu Yuan's corpse.</p><p>Along the way, he made up his mind that once he had reported his mission to the sect, he would first go to the Pagoda Peak to ascertain the effects and worth of the mysterious orchid before resigning from his杂役 duties at the Earthly Abyss Cave and returning to his cave abode to seclude himself in bitter cultivation.</p>
