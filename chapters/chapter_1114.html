<h1>Chapter 1106: Clues</h1><p>As Qin Sang passed by the Yin Mountain Pass, he couldn't help but recall the Tan brothers and Shi Hong.  </p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had delivered the Corpse Restraining Talisman and the ice coffin to help Tan Hao sustain Tan Jie's life. Who could have imagined that, in the Canglang Sea, he would replicate Tan Hao's story?  </p><p>A century had passed, and he wondered how many of his old acquaintances were still alive.  </p><p>Shi Hong had dispersed her cultivation and started anew. Despite her dual spiritual root talent, it was unlikely she would achieve much.  </p><p>Qin Sang was mentally prepared; this time, he would most likely find only her grave.  </p><p>As for Tan Hao, if he had failed to form his Golden Core, his lifespan would also be nearing its end.  </p><p>The difficulty of gathering cultivation resources as a rogue cultivator was something sect disciples could hardly fathom.  </p><p>Was he still here?  </p><p>The cave dwelling was deep within the Hundred Thousand Mountains, on a desolate snowy peak in a remote location.  </p><p>Qin Sang found the spot from his memory and discovered that the cave was still well-hidden, protected by a powerful spiritual formation. His heart stirred, and he sent a surge of true essence into the formation.  </p><p>"Who's there?"  </p><p>The formation rippled.  </p><p>Moments later, a cautious voice called out from within the cave.  </p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. The voice didn't sound like Tan Hao's. After a moment's thought, he raised his voice and said, "This place once belonged to an old friend of mine, Daoist Tan Hao. Is he still here?"  </p><p>"You know my father?"  </p><p>The voice from the cave sounded surprised.  </p><p>Qin Sang could sense a faint gaze scrutinizing him from the shadows. Unperturbed, he asked in return, "Are you Tan Hao's descendant?"  </p><p>"This junior is Tan Yien. Since you know the location of this cave and are specifically looking for my father, you must have a deep connection with him. However, I've accompanied my father to meet most of his old friends, and I've never heard him mention you..."  </p><p>Tan Yien hesitated.  </p><p>He didn't recognize Qin Sang and was reluctant to invite him in.  </p><p>At this moment, although Qin Sang wasn't wearing a mask, he had altered his appearance using a secret technique.  </p><p>"Tan Yien..."  </p><p>Qin Sang silently repeated the name of Tan Hao's descendant, feeling a wave of nostalgia. "My surname is Qin. I was once a fellow disciple of your father's, both of us having joined the Ghost Yin Sect..."  </p><p>"Qin... You're Uncle Qin!"  </p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish, Tan Yien exclaimed in shock.  </p><p>Immediately, the formation parted, and a figure hurried out—a burly man whose build was a spitting image of Tan Hao's.  </p><p>Qin Sang examined him.  </p><p>Tan Yien was at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, and his features bore a resemblance to Tan Hao's, though his face was slightly more refined, reminding Qin Sang of another old acquaintance—Shi Hong.  </p><p>"Uncle Qin, your kindness to our family is immeasurable. My parents often reminded me never to forget your grace! I was rude to keep you waiting outside. Please forgive me, Uncle Qin!"  </p><p>Tan Yien spoke with great emotion, bowing deeply to Qin Sang.  </p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, stopping Tan Yien from prostrating, and said, "No need for such formalities. So, your mother is Senior Sister Shi Hong?"  </p><p>Tan Yien nodded repeatedly and invited Qin Sang into the cave, his demeanor extremely respectful.  </p><p>Shi Hong had chosen not to return to her homeland, staying behind to continue her cultivation under Tan Hao's care.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, this had led to a marriage.  </p><p>Qin Sang nodded lightly. Upon entering, he noticed that the cave had undergone significant changes, now more suited for living and cultivation.  </p><p>He glanced around but didn't sense anyone else's presence. Frowning, he asked, "Are you the only one here? The last time I saw your parents was a century ago. Are they still alive?"  </p><p>Tan Yien's expression darkened. "A century ago, my mother passed away..."  </p><p>He led Qin Sang into an inner chamber, where Shi Hong's memorial tablet stood.  </p><p>Listening to Tan Yien recount Shi Hong's experiences, Qin Sang found them to be as he had expected.  </p><p>After dispersing her cultivation, Shi Hong had never given up.  </p><p>But human effort could not defy fate. Even with Tan Hao's help, after years of arduous cultivation, she had only managed to reach the eighth level of Qi Refining before hitting a wall, with no hope of forming a Foundation.  </p><p>Tan Hao and Shi Hong had relied on each other, and over time, their bond deepened. They became husband and wife and gave birth to Tan Yien.  </p><p>"Is Brother Tan still alive?"  </p><p>Qin Sang didn't see Tan Hao's memorial tablet or the ice coffin.  </p><p>Tan Yien hesitated. "My father was determined to awaken my uncle. He said he had found some clues and, after helping me form my Foundation, left with my uncle. Not long after, he sent a letter through a merchant guild, but since then, there's been no word. He hasn't returned."  </p><p>"Clues? What clues?"  </p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, and he pressed for answers.  </p><p>Before leaving, he had mentioned to Tan Hao the connection between the Corpse Restraining Talisman and the Corpse Refining Sect.  </p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had spent years infiltrating the Qingyang Market, investigating the Corpse Refining Sect, but had found nothing. Could Tan Hao have discovered something about the sect?  </p><p>"My father said that awakening my uncle was his responsibility alone and that he didn't want to burden his descendants. He rarely spoke of these matters to me, only dropping a few hints..."  </p><p>Tan Yien frowned, trying to recall.  </p><p>At Qin Sang's prompting, he began to recount Tan Hao's experiences.  </p><p>Tan Hao had actually succeeded in forming his Golden Core!  </p><p>"After the war began, my father voluntarily joined the battlefield, fighting through blood and fire, risking his life multiple times to earn merits and rewards from the Two Domains Alliance. Before he left, he was only at the False Core stage, but in his letter, he mentioned that he had finally formed his Golden Core..."  </p><p>Tan Yien spoke softly.  </p><p>Tan Hao had never shared the details of his battlefield experiences with Tan Yien, who was unaware of the specifics.  </p><p>But Qin Sang could imagine the life-and-death struggles Tan Hao must have endured.  </p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had participated in the conflicts between the Cold Moon Domain and the Heavenly Travel Alliance, but the scale and ferocity of that war paled in comparison to this one. Even so, he had faced danger multiple times.  </p><p>Tan Hao, as a rogue cultivator with no one to rely on, had emerged from mountains of corpses and seas of blood on his own!  </p><p>The hardships he endured were known only to him.  </p><p>For some, there was joy; for others, sorrow.  </p><p>The war brought disaster, but it was also an opportunity for some cultivators.  </p><p>Among the most widely circulated legends was that of the current sect master of the Qingyang Demon Sect.  </p><p>Back when Qin Sang had infiltrated the Qingyang Demon Sect to steal the Qingyang Divine Aura, the sect master had only been at the late Golden Core stage, and the sect was in decline.  </p><p>It was said that his chances of forming a Nascent Soul were slim.  </p><p>But when the war came, the sect master had somehow gained a great opportunity, quickly rising to prominence, earning illustrious merits, and breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage.  </p><p>Afterward, he led the Qingyang Demon Sect to become a major demonic faction, restoring its former glory.  </p><p>Tan Hao was no different.  </p><p>He had always been a rogue cultivator, without the protection of a sect. The only thing he could do was risk his life to earn merits and exchange them for resources to form his Golden Core.  </p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet seen Mei Gu, but he imagined she had a similar story.  </p><p>"In his letter, my father said he would leave the Cold Moon Domain and infiltrate the Sin Abyss territory to search for clues. He also urged me to focus on my cultivation and not be distracted by this..."  </p><p>Tan Yien said, presenting Tan Hao's letter to Qin Sang.  </p><p>After reading it, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.  </p><p>So, was the Corpse Refining Sect's headquarters not in the Cold Moon Domain?  </p><p>No wonder he had never found anything back then!  </p><p>Qin Sang had only operated within the Cold Moon Domain and had never even visited the Heavenly Travel Alliance.  </p><p>Tan Hao, having interacted with cultivators from the Heavenly Travel Alliance and the Sin Abyss on the battlefield, might have truly discovered something. Who would have thought that clues about the Corpse Refining Sect would come from Tan Hao?  </p><p>Qin Sang urged Tan Yien to carefully recall every word Tan Hao had ever said.</p>
