<h1>Chapter 1430: The Wish-Fulfilling Orb</h1><p>Chapter 1430: The Wish-Fulfilling Orb</p><p>Three spirit insects had consumed the Myriad Spirit Fruits.</p><p>Qin Sang placed them outside and observed them for a while, noticing no obvious changes.</p><p>The Myriad Spirit Fruit doesn't directly increase the spirit insects' cultivation; according to Valley Master Mu, the benefit lies in their spiritual nature.  This is invaluable and the reason it increases the success rate of the Ascending Spirit Ceremony.</p><p>“The changes will be apparent only after they've digested the medicinal power.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, letting them sleep.</p><p>Next, he resealed the remaining Myriad Spirit Fruits and took out the tree root segment.</p><p>The broken root contains spiritual essence.</p><p>If cultivated properly, it could grow into a new Myriad Spirit Fruit tree, providing a continuous supply of fruit.</p><p>But Qin Sang had no idea how to cultivate the Myriad Spirit Fruit tree.  These spirit trees have extremely long growth cycles; even if he successfully cultivated one, it's uncertain when it would bear fruit.</p><p>“I should look for relevant information when I have the chance.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, leaving the quiet chamber. He found the area with the most abundant spiritual energy in his cave dwelling, set up a conservative cultivation restriction for spiritual herbs, and placed the root segment there.</p><p>This location is hidden; he'll leave the root here for now and take it back to Qingyang Temple later.</p><p>Then he returned to the quiet chamber and took out five jade boxes.</p><p>Each jade box contained a different spiritual herb; including the one he gave to Tan Hao, there were six in total – all rare and precious herbs unobtainable with spirit stones in the outside world.</p><p>Among them, the Spirit Lamp Flower was the most valuable.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to commission someone to refine them into Concealing Fragrance Pills that enhance spiritual perception for his own use.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had been careful to cover his tracks in the secret passage, the Old Demon Hun couldn't be certain it was him. However, this old demon always operates under the principle of eliminating any potential threat.</p><p>Qin Sang urgently needed to further enhance his strength.</p><p>Advancing to the second stage of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* is the quickest way.</p><p>With his spiritual perception taking on a physical form, comparable to that of a great cultivator, even if he were to stand before Old Demon Hun, he wouldn't worry about his disguise being seen through.</p><p>The Fire Lotus Seed has already matured. Qin Sang has been refining the demonic fire; a breakthrough is only a matter of time. Taking the Concealing Fragrance Pills will accelerate the process.</p><p>The remaining four herbs don't directly enhance cultivation or strength. Each has its uses, but none are urgently needed by Qin Sang.</p><p>It would be best to exchange them for treasures he needs.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered the Wanmo Assembly nine years later.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally decided to attend the Wanmo Assembly, but after this incident, he must carefully reconsider.</p><p>This grand gathering of Yuan Ying cultivators for trading would undoubtedly see countless rare treasures appear – materials for the Golden Sink Sword, spiritual objects for the Ascending Spirit Ceremony, various unique cultivation techniques and secret arts – all would have a chance to be acquired there.</p><p>He needed to prepare for his breakthrough to the late Yuan Ying stage; any secret arts that could increase his chances of success, he would accept without hesitation.</p><p>It just so happens that Qin Sang has spiritual herbs to trade; missing this opportunity would be a pity.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that even Baihua Valley, with all its precious spiritual objects, probably didn't have many of the materials needed for the Ascending Spirit Ceremony.  Even if he traded a Myriad Spirit Fruit, he'd be lucky to get one portion in exchange, and he needed at least two.</p><p>One for the Fire Jade Centipede and one for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>But the location of the Wanmo Assembly is Hunmo Island, the lair of Old Demon Hun!</p><p>Tan Hao still needs several decades of quiet cultivation before he dares attempt a breakthrough, leaving him no time to attend the Wanmo Assembly.  At the Golden Core stage, he cannot replace Qin Sang at this top-level trade fair.</p><p>The Wanmo Assembly is the greatest event in the Boundless Sea, attracting Yuan Ying cultivators and demon kings from the Outer Regions. It’s impossible for Old Demon Hun to control everything, right?</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the jade boxes lightly, deep in thought, deciding to wait until he’d gathered more information before making a decision.</p><p>He altered the preservation methods based on the characteristics of the different herbs, then took out the three magic treasures he'd obtained in the Buddhist temple.</p><p>He and Tan Hao had already analyzed the Demon-Subduing Pestle.</p><p>Qin Sang set it aside for the time being, intending to try refining it again later, to change its form.</p><p>The orb and the Seven-Story Pagoda were placed before him.</p><p>Both treasures were incredibly pure, inspiring contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze shifted to the orb, which he picked up.</p><p>“Wish-Fulfilling Orb…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured silently.</p><p>He had already tested it along the way; when his spiritual perception probed the orb, these four words automatically appeared in his mind. It must be the orb's name, but there was no further description; Qin Sang would have to explore it himself.</p><p>He held the orb, closed his eyes, and concentrated on analyzing it.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly; the Wish-Fulfilling Orb in his palm suddenly changed, its interior seeming to ripple like water, then suddenly erupting in a strong golden light.</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang seemed to possess a greater sense of Buddhist piety, like a pilgrim bathed in Buddhist light.</p><p>The change didn't stop there; golden light surged forth, forming a circular, pale gold energy shield around him without Qin Sang's control, enveloping him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the protective shield wavered, lasting only three breaths before silently shattering. The Wish-fulfilling Orb immediately dimmed, reverting to its previous form.</p><p>This was because Qin Sang hadn't fully refined the Wish-fulfilling Orb.</p><p>After several attempts, Qin Sang finally managed to forcibly maintain the shield.  Looking at the pale gold shield beside him, he mused, "It's not an offensive artifact, and it doesn't seem to have any special function. Could it be...?"</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang. He summoned the Golden Sinking Sword, sending a beam of sword light towards himself.</p><p>'Ding!'</p><p>The sword light was blocked, and the shield shattered.</p><p>After some experimentation, Qin Sang figured it out.</p><p>The Wish-fulfilling Orb wasn't the magical artifact he'd hoped for; it was a defensive artifact!</p><p>This was quite a good outcome. After using the Nine-Lives Xuanwu Shell to refine the Solar God Tree, Qin Sang had been lacking a protective treasure.</p><p>The best defensive artifacts are those that can sense danger and protect their owner automatically.</p><p>The Wish-fulfilling Orb wasn't that type, but it could be stored in his dantian. With a thought, Qin Sang could instantly release the shield.</p><p>The problem was, Qin Sang couldn't determine the Orb's grade! He considered himself quite accomplished in the art of refining artifacts.</p><p>"This is rather strange," he mused. "Could it be a Buddhist artifact?  The Buddhist methods of artifact refinement are different from what I've learned?"</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the Wish-fulfilling Orb. "I'll know its true power once I've fully refined it. It shouldn't take too long."</p><p>He performed a brief refinement and stored the orb in his dantian, keeping it company with his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Only after picking up the Seven-Story Pagoda did he realize that this item was even stranger.</p><p>"This isn't an artifact?"</p><p>Qin Sang's astonished voice echoed in the quiet chamber.</p><p>He had tried various methods—divine sense, true essence, even transforming into his demonic form—but the Seven-Story Pagoda remained unresponsive, lying still in his palm.</p><p>Its light remained constant, without the slightest fluctuation. Qin Sang suspected the light came from the pagoda's material itself.</p><p>Even if it were a Buddhist artifact, its behavior was unusual.</p><p>Unfortunately, his knowledge of Buddhism was limited.</p><p>Could it not be an artifact?</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the question in his mind.</p><p>He had risked much to obtain this, and Qin Sang was somewhat disappointed. He tried various methods again, but the result remained the same.</p><p>This avenue was a dead end; he would have to investigate Jinghai Sect and the Buddhist temple.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information he'd learned from Tan Hao and the arrangement of the Buddhist temple.</p>
