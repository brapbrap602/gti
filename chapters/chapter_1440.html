<h1>First Thousand Four Hundred and Thirty-Second Chapter The Value of the Pill Formula</h1><p>Blue Star Island.</p><p>Qin Sang put on his mask, found the Pill Cauldron Society, and directly revealed his Nascent Soul cultivator aura.</p><p>The steward of the Pill Cauldron Society respectfully invited him into a quiet room, and after clarifying his purpose, hurried away.</p><p>Before long.</p><p>An old man in a green robe in the late Golden Core stage walked in, first giving Qin Sang a salute, and respectfully said, "Reporting to Senior, Senior wants to refine the Hidden Fragrance Pill, and only the Grand Elder's personal intervention can ensure success. Unfortunately, he returned to Pill Cauldron Mountain to cultivate in seclusion not long ago. It is said that he sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough and will not return to the Boundless Sea for at least half a year. If Senior needs it urgently, we can only ask other Seniors for help."</p><p>Facing a Nascent Soul Ancestor, he dared not hide anything and revealed the relationship between the Pill Cauldron Society and Pill Cauldron Mountain.</p><p>Seclusion for a breakthrough?</p><p>The Sect Master of Pill Cauldron Mountain is in the middle Nascent Soul stage, and he probably wouldn't lower his status to personally come to the sea and take charge of the Pill Cauldron Society's affairs.</p><p>It's probably a Nascent Soul early stage cultivator from Pill Cauldron Mountain, preparing to advance to the middle Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Pill Cauldron Mountain is quite strong!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought leisurely.</p><p>Originating from a sect skilled in alchemy, cultivation and breakthroughs are always easier than others.</p><p>The Taiyi Pill Sect was just a little lacking in Chongxu Daoist's generation, but two Nascent Souls immediately appeared afterward, and now it's flourishing.</p><p>"Within Pill Cauldron Mountain, is Daoist Yin Quan the most proficient in alchemy?"</p><p>Qin Sang coughed lightly and asked, the Grand Elder of the Pill Cauldron Society is indeed True Person Yin Quan.</p><p>"Indeed, the Pill Cauldron Society was mainly established by the Grand Elder."</p><p>The old man replied with a look of reverence.</p><p>Half a yearâ€¦</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and decided to wait half a year. There's only one Spirit Lamp Flower (Divine Lantern Flower), so it's better to be cautious.</p><p>He nodded, "You arrange a cave dwelling for this old man on the island. I'll wait here for Daoist Yin Quan. Also, help me collect these spiritual herbs."</p><p>As he spoke, he took out a jade slip and threw a bag of spirit stones to the old man.</p><p>Written on the jade slip were the auxiliary herbs needed for the Hidden Fragrance Pill.</p><p>The Spirit Lamp Flower is the only main herb, and also the most difficult spiritual herb on the pill formula to find. The other auxiliary herbs are far less valuable than the Spirit Lamp Flower, and only two of them are somewhat troublesome, but he believed that the Pill Cauldron Society would definitely have a way.</p><p>For a Nascent Soul cultivator, anything that can be solved with spirit stones is not a problem.</p><p>Of course, in the cultivation world, top-grade spirit stones are also rare, and Nascent Soul cultivators won't have too many on them.</p><p>The best-grade spirit stones are even rarer. Qin Sang, as the master of a sect, doesn't have a single one. The compensation taken out by Sin Abyss when they surrendered didn't have any best-grade spirit stones either.</p><p>The reward for entrusting True Person Yin Quan with refining the pill would be discussed when they met.</p><p>After the old man read the contents of the jade slip, his expression was slightly surprised, but he didn't dare to ask more questions. He counted the spirit stones in front of Qin Sang and replied, "Senior, these spirit stones are more than enough. This junior will order someone to clean the cave dwelling immediately."</p><p>After the time it takes to burn an incense stick.</p><p>The old man led Qin Sang to the best cave dwelling on the island to live in.</p><p>After this, Qin Sang never left the cave dwelling.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang devoted almost all his energy to refining the Nine Nether Demonic Flame (Ninefold Hellfire), trying to improve the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* as much as possible, so as not to waste any medicinal power when taking the Hidden Fragrance Pill.</p><p>After waiting on Blue Star Island for seven months, Qin Sang finally met this Grand Elder of the Pill Cauldron Society.</p><p>Daoist Yin Quan wore a Daoist robe, his figure was somewhat thin, his eyes were extremely bright and piercing, and the aura around him was not yet stable. Qin Sang could tell at a glance that he had already broken through to the middle Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Congratulations Daoist on taking another step forward on the Great Path (Grand Dao)."</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in congratulation.</p><p>Daoist Yin Quan couldn't hide his joy and repeatedly said, "This poor Daoist (this humble one) received a message as soon as I left seclusion, informing me that Daoist Qin wanted to refine the Hidden Fragrance Pill. Not daring to keep Daoist waiting, I hastily came here after slightly stabilizing my cultivation."</p><p>The Daoist title (Daoist name) Mingyue isn't safe, Qin Sang is using his real name now.</p><p>True Person Yin Quan definitely hadn't heard of this person before. A middle Nascent Soul cultivator couldn't be unknown, and after looking at the mask on Qin Sang's face, he tactfully didn't ask any more questions.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang directly asked, "I wonder what conditions Daoist Yin Quan needs to open the furnace and refine the pill?"</p><p>True Person Yin Quan revealed a smile and unexpectedly said, "Daoist Qin may not know this, but Pill Cauldron Mountain also treasures the Hidden Fragrance Pill formula, but it's incomplete, and the chance of successfully refining the pill is less than ten percent. This poor Daoist was originally somewhat skeptical, but after seeing the spiritual herbs Daoist requested, I dare to confirm that you truly have a more complete ancient formula. Daoist Qin, could you tell this poor Daoist where you obtained the pill formula? Do you have any other ancient formulas in your possession? Not only will this poor Daoist not take a single spirit stone this time, but if you have any requests in the future, this poor Daoist can open the furnace for Daoist at any time!"</p><p>The Ancient Immortal Battlefield (Ancient Immortal Realm) is truly a treasure land!</p><p>This was the only thought that popped into Qin Sang's mind after listening.</p><p>Before deciding to travel abroad, Qin Sang used some of the Yuan Shen Sect's formation classics and some useful pill formulas traded from the Taiyi Pill Sect's Mirror Forest, the Hidden Fragrance Pill being one of them.</p><p>He did this in case he encountered spiritual herbs outside but couldn't find someone who knew how to refine pills.</p><p>Now it seems that being prepared for a rainy day is indeed the right thing to do.</p><p>The reason Mirror Forest agreed to the trade was because the main herbs of these ancient formulas were extremely rare in the current world, and their dissemination wouldn't have much of an impact.</p><p>Finding the Spirit Lamp Flower in the Pure Sea Sect was a completely unexpected joy.</p><p>Bringing it to the Northern Sea (North Sea Region), the value of the pill formula has skyrocketed.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that he couldn't reveal the origin, although the connection between the two regions had been broken for a long time, but the two Grand Monks (Great Cultivators) of the Northern Chen Domain had ascended, so it was really uneasy.</p><p>"Qin accidentally obtained two pill formulas, this is another one. If Daoist is interested, if Qin obtains any more ancient formulas of this kind in the future, I will have someone send them to the Pill Cauldron Society for Daoist to appraise."</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely said, randomly picking a more complex one that was almost impossible to collect all the ingredients for, and handing it to True Person Yin Quan.</p><p>This was the reward, the Hidden Fragrance Pill formula was a must-give.</p><p>He wasn't afraid that True Person Yin Quan would suspect that he had even more in his possession, as this would highlight his value and make True Person Yin Quan take him seriously.</p><p>He planned to slowly discuss the other pill formulas when he had time.</p><p>True Person Yin Quan put away the pill formula and took a deep look at Qin Sang, "Then this poor Daoist will wait for Daoist's good news!"</p><p>Next.</p><p>After waiting for the last auxiliary herb to be delivered and another month, True Person Yin Quan opened the furnace to refine the pill.</p><p>When Qin Sang finished drinking a pot of spiritual tea in the quiet room.</p><p>True Person Yin Quan pushed the door open and entered, looking at Qin Sang who stood up and looked over, he said with a smile, "Fortunately, I didn't fail my mission!"</p><p>As he spoke, he took out a jade bottle and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Inside the jade bottle was a dark yellow spiritual pill. The medicinal power formed a thin layer of mist on the surface of the spiritual pill, and a phantom of a spiritual flower, which was the Spirit Lamp Flower, would occasionally emerge.</p><p>Opening the bottle cap, Qin Sang smelled a fragrance similar to the Spirit Lamp Flower and immediately felt his mind clear and greatly rejoiced.</p><p>After obtaining the Hidden Fragrance Pill, Qin Sang originally wanted to bid farewell and immediately go back to refine the medicinal pill, but he was stopped by True Person Yin Quan.</p><p>"I just browsed through the news recently collected by the Chamber of Commerce. I didn't expect that so many major events had happened in the Boundless Sea during the time I was away. Daoist has been on Blue Star Island all this time, so you probably haven't heard about it yet, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, isn't it just the emergence of the Pure Sea Sect, you don't know that the Spirit Lamp Flower was dug up from the Pure Sea Sect, do you?</p><p>He casually asked what happened, but he heard True Person Yin Quan say, "The biggest event is that the Myriad Demons Assembly (Ten Thousand Fiends Gathering) will be held in half a year!"</p>
