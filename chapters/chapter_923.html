<h1>Chapter 915: The Sect Master of the Demonic Sacrificial Cave</h1><p>“Radiant Light Sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, recalling the sect.</p><p>They were the dominant force on a large island located tens of thousands of miles north of the Shattered Wind Archipelago. Their leader was a Nascent Soul Grand Patriarch, but he was the only one.  Similar to the Lan Dou Sect, they were past their prime.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. After questioning the scholar separately, he learned that the scholar had only offended an elder of the Radiant Light Sect by accidentally killing a favored personal disciple, forcing him to flee to the Shattered Wind Archipelago.</p><p>The elder wasn't a particularly important figure in the Radiant Light Sect.</p><p>If it had been the Nascent Soul Grand Patriarch, or a Nascent Soul adopted son like Senior Lu, he might have been somewhat concerned. But other Core Formation cultivators weren't a threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>Besides, this was the Shattered Wind Archipelago, a chaotic place by nature.</p><p>As for the Demonic Sacrificial Cave, Qin Sang had learned about them before.  A group of demonic cultivators had banded together and were actively recruiting, becoming a significant force in the region.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was questioning the scholar's family, the Sect Master of the Demonic Sacrificial Cave had already landed on Poison Island and discovered the illusion formation.  This person was actually a late-stage Core Formation expert, and a simple illusion formation naturally couldn't fool him.</p><p>“Hmm? When was this island occupied? Could the Eagle King have been eliminated?”</p><p>The Sect Master of the Demonic Sacrificial Cave paused, stopping in front of the illusion formation with a surprised expression.</p><p>At this moment, his subordinates, riding on gusts of dark wind, arrived and landed beside him.</p><p>They hadn't noticed the illusion formation at first.  Seeing the Sect Master's strange expression, they looked carefully and realized that the poisonous miasma was mixed with an illusion.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The old man and the others gasped in shock.  “Poisonous miasma mixed with an illusion, what a vicious method! Master, when did this Poison Island get an illusion formation? Has some senior established a sanctuary here? Why have I never heard of this? Has the Rotwing Eagle King been eliminated?”</p><p>The Sect Master of the Demonic Sacrificial Cave snorted. “How would I know who did it? Look up there, those are all Foundation Establishment Rotwing Eagles, acting so docile. It seems the Eagle King and the greater demons have indeed been eliminated. I wonder which fellow Daoist has such great skill, silently occupying this Poison Island…”</p><p>The Sect Master narrowed his eyes, pondered for a moment, then his expression shifted slightly and he suddenly transmitted his voice to the old man and the others.</p><p>The old man was startled.</p><p>“Master, the one who could kill the Eagle King on Poison Island must possess extraordinary strength. Perhaps we should stabilize this person, gather more men, and then slowly make our move…”</p><p>“Slowly make our move? By the time we leave, this person will have long since escaped.”</p><p>The Sect Master interrupted the old man coldly. “I want this person! And the island as well. Mere Rotwing Eagles…if I wasn’t worried about the potent poison on them, I would have already cleared out those annoying creatures with Fellow Daoist Xun. This person might have used some detoxification method to kill the Eagle King. Their true strength may not be that great, otherwise why would they stay in such a place, leaving behind Rotwing Eagles as a disguise, hiding their identity? This illusion formation can only trap you lot, it's not a particularly sophisticated one. Of course, I won't act rashly. I just want you to be prepared. Fellow Daoist Xun is nearby, and I've already secretly sent him a message. We'll probe this person’s background first…”</p><p>“Since Master has already contacted Senior Xun, it will definitely be foolproof!”</p><p>The old man and the others were overjoyed, silently standing behind the Sect Master. Each of them held a strange iron plate in their palms, but remained outwardly calm.</p><p>The Senior Xun they mentioned was the second strongest expert in the Demonic Sacrificial Cave, second only to the Sect Master.</p><p>“This Zuo was unaware that this island has been established as a fellow Daoist’s sanctuary.  I apologize for my intrusion today. Please don't take offense.”</p><p>The Sect Master, with his hands clasped behind his back, looked up at the top of the illusion formation, his voice booming into the formation.</p><p>The scholar also heard the Sect Master's voice, his heart tightening suddenly with a look of terror on his face.</p><p>Just as his voice faded, a sigh came from within. “This poor Daoist assumed you were merely passing by, and therefore did not wish to disturb you.”</p><p>The corners of the Sect Master’s mouth curled up slightly.</p><p>“Hehe, This Zuo indeed wasn’t coming here specifically, but was chasing a few traitors from the Demonic Sacrificial Cave. However, thanks to them, This Zuo has learned that I have a new neighbor.  Meeting like this is fate. Fellow Daoist, why not dispel the illusion and show yourself? Our Demonic Sacrificial Cave is eager for talent, and needs experts like you…”</p><p>He made no mention of demanding the young woman, instead trying to recruit Qin Sang.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the poisonous miasma suddenly churned and parted to the sides, revealing a passage. Then, after a ripple of energy, a figure appeared before them.</p><p>At the same time, they felt a gust of wind from the side, and two figures appeared on either side of them, surrounding them.</p><p>It was the Two-Headed Flood Dragon's true form.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this…”</p><p>Seeing this, the Sect Master’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>He never expected that such a barren place, a stinking poison island, would be hiding two Core Formation cultivators and a powerful demon.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, “Sect Master, your presence brings honor to my humble abode. However, your subordinates concealing weapons isn't very hospitable, is it? And that insect you released earlier, who were you contacting?”</p><p>The Sect Master's actions were extremely cautious, and the message-carrying insect was adept at concealment, but it couldn't escape the Sky-Eye Butterfly's notice. Qin Sang had seen everything.</p><p>The Sect Master forced a smile. “Fellow Daoist, please don't misunderstand. This Zuo was only being cautious…”</p><p>As he spoke, his eyes suddenly filled with a dense black light, transforming into demonic pupils.  He shot out a strange gaze that pierced through the poisonous miasma, taking in the scene within the spirit formation.</p><p>“A mid-stage Core Formation cultivator dares to play tricks in front of me? You’re courting death!”</p><p>Having confirmed there were no other ambushes, the Sect Master sneered. “Attack!”</p><p>The old man and the others had been ready. At the Sect Master’s command, the other four immediately spread out around the old man and abruptly threw out the iron plates in their hands.</p><p>The power of these iron plates had already been activated. With a series of muffled bangs, they merged into a single streak of black light, shooting towards the Two-Headed Flood Dragon like an arrow.</p><p>At the same time, a shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>The Sect Master’s figure flickered, and he turned and fled towards the edge of Poison Island.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang ready to fight without hesitation, with two Core Formation cultivators and a powerful demon, he decided to retreat, planning to regroup with his companion and counterattack together.</p><p>His subordinates clearly didn't expect the Sect Master to do this.  They were stunned, then their faces turned pale as they realized they had been abandoned.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but laugh.  These old demons were truly cunning.</p><p>“Since you’re here, why the rush to leave?”</p><p>A dragon shadow flashed around Qin Sang.  He transformed into a red light, instantly intercepting the Sect Master.</p>
