Chapter 686: Four Years

After selecting a cave dwelling, Qin Sang gave the bone sword and bone spear to the gray-robed man and the old woman, respectively. He then requested the most proficient magical artifacts from the other three.  Qin Sang, not being stingy, directly refined the Jiao corpse he had previously hunted to enhance the power of their artifacts.

To have these people help him search for demons, he needed to provide them with more life-saving means, so they could explore more areas. The Floating Whisker Sea was practically at the outermost edge of the area where Cloud Rock Island cultivators operated. It was a chaotic place, and although they wouldn't be hunting demons, searching for traces of powerful demons everywhere still carried considerable risks.

Fortunately, there were very few cultivators active in the Floating Whisker Sea. In the vast ocean, it was almost impossible to encounter others, so they didn't need to specifically guard against other cultivators.

Luckily, less than a month after arriving in the Floating Whisker Sea, they helped Qin Sang find a suitable Red Jiao.

Finally having gathered nine Jiao dragon souls, the power of the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman was fully unleashed. The original jade tablet-shaped talisman transformed into a palm-sized jade dragon, resembling a living Jiao, dormant within Qin Sang's Qi Sea.

Those unaware of its true nature would never imagine it was a talisman!

Once the talisman was activated, a light shield appeared around Qin Sang. Nine Jiao shadows circled the shield's surface. Because there were five Red Jiao souls, the shield had a distinct crimson hue, as if Qin Sang was draped in the legendary Nine Dragons Divine Fire Shield, extraordinarily peculiar.

After its transformation, the fully activated talisman's power was even stronger than Qin Sang had anticipated.

During the Two Realms War, Qin Sang had personally witnessed Nascent Soul cultivators battling numerous times. Secretly comparing, with the addition of Sword Qi Thunder Sound, his escape speed even slightly surpassed that of typical late-Nascent Soul cultivators.

Once he broke through to mid-Nascent Soul, those late-Nascent Soul cultivators would only see his dust.

However, Qin Sang estimated that the talisman's power had a limit. Even after breaking through to the late stage, combined with Sword Qi Thunder Sound, it likely wouldn't be able to match the escape speed of a Grand Ancestor.

Of the Supreme Purity Palace's four secret talismans, the Inner Landscape Talisman, the Heavenly Dipper Blade Talisman, and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman were all Nascent Soul level treasures.

The last talisman was said to be related to the Nascent Soul, but it was exceptionally mysterious.  Despite extensive inquiries, Qin Sang couldn't even learn its name, let alone its function.

Correspondingly, the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman's True Essence consumption also skyrocketed, even more terrifying than the Ten Yama Banners.

The first time Qin Sang activated the complete Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, he became somewhat carried away with delight. By the time he realized his True Essence was nearing depletion, it was too late. He nearly fell into the water, quite embarrassed.

With Qin Sang's current cultivation, he couldn't activate the talisman for long before his True Essence would be exhausted. However, for escaping in critical moments, it was absolutely sufficient.

With the talisman's protection, Qin Sang's tightly wound nerves could finally relax a bit, but he still didn't dare to lower his guard. If he provoked a late-Demon Core demon, even the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman might not be able to help him escape.

Of course, facing demons below the late-Demon Core stage, as long as they weren't proficient in escape techniques, Qin Sang could handle them calmly. If he couldn't win, he'd treat it as practice, activating the talisman to escape if the situation turned unfavorable.

Those demons couldn't catch up, watching Qin Sang's fleeing figure with impotent rage.

In fact, this was exactly what Qin Sang did when he encountered the first demon beast in the Floating Whisker Sea.

It was a mid-Demon Core Floating Whisker.

Floating Whiskers were a type of fish demon, shaped like eels, but with parrot-like beaks and eight legs, making their appearance quite bizarre.

They were naturally born water-type demons, with extremely powerful water-based magic. Their eight legs, working in pairs, could actually execute four different magical techniques, changing unpredictably and making them difficult to guard against.

Among the Floating Whisker's four most proficient magical techniques, water escape was notably absent.

In the past, Qin Sang definitely wouldn't dare provoke such a powerful demon. Now, naturally, he wouldn't let such a good training opponent go.

After discovering this Floating Whisker, Qin Sang became addicted. Every so often, he would seek it out, engage in a great battle, then activate the talisman and swagger away, returning to his cave to cultivate.

Initially, Qin Sang had considered killing this demon. Later, he realized it was nearly impossible. The Floating Whisker's four magical techniques were all formidable, and their combined power was even greater.

Even if he was willing to risk the destruction of his Flying Sky Night Fork, he still wasn't confident.

Hunting demons in the Demon Sea required more than just comparing strength.

Several times during their battles, when the fight reached a stalemate and dragged on too long, Qin Sang sensed something amiss in the surrounding waters. Other powerful demons were definitely alerted by the battle and were stealthily approaching.

In such situations, Qin Sang could only flee.

However, Qin Sang hadn't completely abandoned the idea of killing it. After several battles, he had thoroughly grasped the Floating Whisker's methods and planned to return to Cloud Rock Island to gather reinforcements to hunt it down.

Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang was dreaming of hunting the demon, he suddenly discovered that the Floating Whisker, thoroughly annoyed by his harassment, had abandoned its territory and disappeared without a trace.

Qin Sang was unwilling to give up and searched several times, but the Floating Whisker was nowhere to be found, having left its home far behind.

This was just a minor episode. Qin Sang's training journey wasn't affected and, with the help of the old couple and the other three, proceeded very smoothly.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang had spent four years in the Floating Whisker Sea.

Qin Sang, judging the situation and coming and going like the wind, practically became a plague of the Floating Whisker Sea.  Those powerful demons who exposed themselves were basically all harassed by him.

Although he spent more time cultivating, Qin Sang's Thousand Jun Ring still accumulated more than a dozen Demon Cores, though all were early-Demon Core stage.

During this period, they also encountered several dangerous situations.

The gray-robed man was discovered by a demonic bird and had an arm bitten off, escaping by self-detonating his bone sword. The old couple once nearly lost their lives to a demon beast, but luckily Qin Sang arrived in time and saved them.

Qin Sang himself was no exception.

During a battle with a mid-Demon Core demon beast, he was sensed by a passing late-Demon Core demon.

Qin Sang was startled and immediately activated the talisman, fleeing for his life. The powerful demon, seeing Qin Sang's incredible speed and attracted by the blood of the demon beast Qin Sang was fighting, gave up the chase.

Qin Sang watched from afar a breathtaking battle between powerful demons, and his original opponent became the late-Demon Core demon's meal.

After the shock subsided, Qin Sang was even more determined to refine the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings as soon as possible.

One of the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings' abilities was its extreme sensitivity to demonic Qi.  Within a certain range, it could actively warn of approaching powerful demons.

This was practically a divine artifact in the Demon Sea. With this treasure, Qin Sang could detect powerful demons in advance, make preparations, and avoid repeating today's near-disaster.

In addition, the most significant function of the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings was controlling demon beasts.

With Qin Sang controlling the Yang Ring, he could use the Yin Ring to control an early-Demon Core demon beast.

Because of the treasure's limited rank, there would be considerable restrictions when using a controlled demon beast in battle. However, it was equivalent to having another helper, apart from the Flying Sky Night Fork, with strength comparable to his own.
