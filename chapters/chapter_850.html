<h1>Chapter 842: Returned</h1><p>After many days of flight, Qin Sang finally encountered other cultivators. From them, he learned startling news that left him deeply shaken.</p><p>During this period, an unexpected upheaval had occurred in the Demon Sea.</p><p>The Wu Clan's stronghold, Sky Witch Island, was suddenly attacked by the demon race and nearly overrun.</p><p>An unknown number of transformed demons had concealed themselves within a beast tide. As they approached Sky Witch Island, they revealed themselves, appearing as if from the heavens. By the time the Wu Clan cultivators noticed the anomaly, it was too late.</p><p>The demon race, having plotted this for a long time, launched a massive assault on Sky Witch Island, successfully breaching the protective formation.</p><p>Countless Sky Witch Island cultivators were killed or injured, and the Wu Clan suffered heavy losses. More terrifyingly, the transformed demons had a clear objective: after breaking through the formation, they made a beeline for the teleportation formation.</p><p>The Turbid Sea and the Demon Sea share similar environments. Both are like tranquil havens amidst endless storms, completely isolated from each other by these very tempests, with no direct passage between them.</p><p>Only the teleportation formations controlled by cultivators allow travel between the two.</p><p>To this day, cultivators remain uncertain whether the Turbid Sea and the Demon Sea exist within the same region, how far apart they are, or if they are separated merely by a storm belt.</p><p>Perhaps they are vastly distant, connected only by the accidental discovery of the teleportation formation.</p><p>However, the cultivators of the Turbid Sea, regardless of their affiliation (righteous, demonic, human, or Wu), share a common understanding: the teleportation formation should be destroyed rather than fall into the hands of the demon race. Otherwise, it wouldn't be cultivators exploring the Demon Sea, but rather the demon race invading the Turbid Sea.</p><p>If Sky Witch Island falls, and the demon race controls the teleportation formation, the Wu Clan will bear the brunt of the invasion of the Turbid Sea, and humanity will not be spared either.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and the other cultivators landed on a deserted island, listening to them recount the rumors.</p><p>These individuals had limited knowledge of the events that transpired on Sky Witch Island that day, relying mostly on hearsay.</p><p>This was a life-and-death battle between Nascent Soul Grandmasters and transformed demons. From the fragmented information, the brutality and terror of the battle were palpable.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that when he first arrived in the Demon Sea and passed through Sky Witch Island, Elder Zou mentioned that human Nascent Soul cultivators were stationed there, and seemingly in considerable numbers.</p><p>When the battle erupted, they couldn't remain detached and were inevitably drawn in. Many Nascent Soul Grandmasters had their physical bodies shattered, escaping only with their nascent souls.</p><p>The Wu Clan's losses were undoubtedly even more devastating.</p><p>It was said that the demon race had even managed to penetrate the Teleportation Hall. Fortunately, the worst-case scenario was averted, and the teleportation formation remained under the cultivators' control.</p><p>The transformed demons lingered outside Sky Witch Island for a long time, but seeing no further opportunity, they finally dispersed.</p><p>However, once news of Sky Witch Island's near fall spread, it caused an uproar among the cultivators.</p><p>Everyone felt threatened, including the Nascent Soul Grandmasters who ruled their own islands.</p><p>In the Demon Sea, apart from Great Desolation Island, no other location possessed defenses comparable to Sky Witch Island.  With Sky Witch Island nearly falling, nowhere besides Great Desolation Island was considered safe.</p><p>Should another large-scale conflict erupt between cultivators and the demon race, they would be the first to be swept away.</p><p>Furthermore, they had been constantly harassed by beast tides recently, leaving them on edge. Upon hearing the news, they abandoned their established territories and fled back to the Turbid Sea.</p><p>The people Qin Sang encountered were stragglers who had gotten separated along the way.  Unwilling to remain in the Demon Sea, they risked traveling to Great Desolation Island, hoping for the best.</p><p>Everyone was deeply worried.</p><p>Hearing these fragmented pieces of information, Qin Sang finally understood why Yu Heng Island received no aid when besieged by the beast tide.</p><p>At that time, other major islands were also facing looming beast tides, blockaded by demonic beasts and preoccupied with their own survival.  Later, upon learning of the incident at Sky Witch Island, they were too terrified to care about anyone else.</p><p>After breaking through the siege, Qin Sang had delayed too long to recover and gather Star Snails, missing the mass exodus.  The deserted islands he saw along the way weren't conquered by beast tides but abandoned by the cultivators.</p><p>"The demon race actually targeted Sky Witch Island. Although the Wu Clan is relatively weaker, could they truly be planning to return to the Turbid Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and bewildered.</p><p>The teleportation formations between the two realms involved secrets.</p><p>From Qin Sang's perspective, they seemed different from the ancient teleportation formation he had used, but in the current cultivation world, it was impossible for cultivators to create such vast and complex teleportation formations.</p><p>Such formations clearly couldn't be constructed just anywhere. Otherwise, with the principle of having multiple hideouts, there wouldn't be only Great Desolation Island and Sky Witch Island after so many years.</p><p>The Wu Clan must have suffered countless casualties to defend Sky Witch Island.</p><p>"The demon race's surprise attack on Sky Witch Island failed, and the humans are now on guard. Will they still target Great Desolation Island? Regardless of whether they return or not, the cultivators won't dare to relax. It will be difficult for the Demon Sea to regain its calm any time soon."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the situation, discreetly glancing at the others.</p><p>They gazed towards Great Desolation Island, aware of the uncertain path ahead, their eyes filled with deep worry.</p><p>"Under the cover of the Demonic Transformation, I'm not as afraid of beast tides and wouldn't be in danger if trapped in the Demon Sea. But for the sake of my External Avatar, I must return to the Turbid Sea as soon as possible. I can't stay here indefinitely..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, "I wonder what the situation is like on Great Desolation Island. If they forbid anyone from returning to the Turbid Sea to ensure the island is defended, it'll be troublesome!"</p><p>Having learned the truth, Qin Sang didn't dare delay any longer. He immediately bid farewell to the others and set off alone, speeding towards Great Desolation Island.</p><p>As he drew closer to Great Desolation Island, he encountered more cultivators and learned more detailed information, along with many tragic stories.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang arrived safely in the waters near Great Desolation Island.</p><p>Surrounding Great Desolation Island were numerous smaller islands.  Those with spiritual veins had been developed into auxiliary islands, guarding Great Desolation Island and forming its first line of defense.</p><p>In the past, when Qin Sang visited, these auxiliary islands appeared ordinary, with only guards patrolling the perimeter.</p><p>Today, upon his return, he saw one of the auxiliary islands from afar and immediately sensed an unusual atmosphere. The protective formation was active, and teams of guards patrolled the sea in shifts, leaving no blind spots, a scene of strict vigilance.</p><p>Qin Sang, wearing his cloak, was spotted by a patrol as soon as he appeared. They flew towards him.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was a cultivator, their vigilance eased somewhat. The leader, a Core Formation early-stage cultivator, addressed Qin Sang respectfully but firmly, "Senior, where do you come from, and do you intend to land on the island?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and replied, "I'm going to Great Desolation Island to use the teleportation formation to return to the Turbid Sea. I ask for your understanding."</p><p>The cultivator shook his head. "Senior, I cannot authorize your passage to Great Desolation Island. Please accompany me to the island first, and someone will make arrangements for you."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. Seeing that the other guards showed no unusual expressions, he considered for a moment, then nodded and followed them towards the auxiliary island.</p><p>--</p><p>I'm back!</p><p>Still on the way back.</p><p>Just this chapter for tonight, I'll try to make up for it tomorrow.</p><p>Ten days, it feels like a lifetime ago. So many emotions, I don't know where to begin.</p><p>Life is unpredictable, and human life is fragile, that goes without saying.</p><p>My biggest takeaway is that the more family members you have, the better.  While a large family can bring its share of trivial matters, it's your family who provides the greatest support when facing major events. Thanks to this support, so many issues have been handled relatively smoothly.</p><p>I definitely want to have more children in the future.</p><p>Also, it's essential to distinguish between fiction and reality. In real life, family ties are truly precious.</p><p>Thank you all for your patience during this long hiatus. I'm back.</p>
