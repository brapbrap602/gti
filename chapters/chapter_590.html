Chapter 583:  It Was Him!


“Get out of the way!”
Yun Youzi, noticing the Night Flying Rakshasa’s strange behavior, urgently warned.
But he was too far away.  Having used all his power from the Demon King Blood Ban and the Immaculate Pearl to restrain the Shadow Devouring Leopard, his spiritual energy was depleted; he was powerless to act.


Why would the Night Flying Rakshasa betray him?
Qin Sang was shocked. He could clearly sense his soul mark was still intact within the Night Flying Rakshasa, undamaged.
Yu Hua's consciousness had been completely erased during the creation of the living corpse.
Logically, the Night Flying Rakshasa should be incapable of betrayal; otherwise, it would have backfired the moment it was created.

The Night Flying Rakshasa's sudden attack came without warning.
To avoid the aftermath of the Sky Void Thunder, Qin Sang had moved to the side, placing them relatively close. When Qin Sang noticed the Night Flying Rakshasa’s attack, it was already upon him.
Caught off guard, Qin Sang’s first reaction was to activate his soul mark, attempting to forcibly control the Night Flying Rakshasa and stop it.

The Night Flying Rakshasa froze, letting out a strange roar.
Its green-faced, fanged visage, previously lifeless and expressionless, now contorted in apparent pain and struggle – surprisingly like a living person.
It was resisting Qin Sang's control!

Simultaneously, Qin Sang sensed an unprecedented power within the Night Flying Rakshasa, violently assaulting his soul mark.
This power was incredibly well-hidden.
Until now, Qin Sang had controlled the Night Flying Rakshasa without ever detecting its presence.  It felt alien and strange, possessing an ominous aura, completely different from the Night Flying Rakshasa's corpse energy.
This was definitely not the Night Flying Rakshasa's own power!

After that momentary pause, the Night Flying Rakshasa lunged again, its face vicious.
The Night Flying Rakshasa moved like a phantom, its corpse energy washing over Qin Sang.
Qin Sang discovered that his soul mark was suppressed by this unknown force; the Night Flying Rakshasa was completely beyond his control!

But Qin Sang wasn't panicked.
He still had time. Though he no longer had the Sky Void Thunder, he had the Corpse Pill.
As he retreated, the Corpse Pill in his dantian finally unlocked, its potent True Essence instantly circulating within him.  A dazzling sword beam flashed between him and the Night Flying Rakshasa.
The sword energy was like a rainbow, accompanied by thunderous roars.
The Ebony Sword displayed its formidable power once more!

Confused by the Night Flying Rakshasa's betrayal, Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  The Ebony Sword struck directly at the Night Flying Rakshasa's brow – its vital point.
Having personally created the Night Flying Rakshasa, Qin Sang knew its weaknesses intimately: its spirit.  Destroying the Heaven Corpse Talisman and annihilating the Night Flying Rakshasa's spirit would kill it.

However, despite the Ebony Sword's speed, the Night Flying Rakshasa reacted just as quickly. With a terrifying cry, it blocked the blow with its ghostly hands at the last moment.
Though its palms were severely injured by the Ebony Sword, it protected its vital point, escaping death.

Immediately afterwards, the Night Flying Rakshasa retreated, a cry escaping its body: "Corpse Pill?"

Hearing the Night Flying Rakshasa's cry, Qin Sang's face darkened.
He had suspected the Night Flying Rakshasa couldn't have betrayed him without reason; unless a wandering spirit had deceived his senses, entering the Night Flying Rakshasa and usurping its body.
After careful consideration, only one place came to mind – the Sunken Cave!

After capturing Yu Hua, until the creation of the Night Flying Rakshasa, Qin Sang had kept it close, making it impossible for anyone to evade his senses and enter the Night Flying Rakshasa’s body.
Only after the killing of the Jade Robe Daoist, when the Night Flying Rakshasa was severely injured and recovering in the Sunken Cave while Qin Sang was absent, did such an infiltration become possible.
This scream confirmed his suspicions.

For some reason, this voice felt familiar to Qin Sang; he seemed to have heard it before.

The situation didn't allow Qin Sang time to ponder.
Having failed its attack, the Night Flying Rakshasa turned towards the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.  A green light shone from its chest as it unleashed astonishing speed – faster than the Ebony Sword imbued with sword energy and thunder.

Yun Youzi, exhausted, was unable to intervene.
Qin Sang was too late to stop it as well.

In an instant, the Night Flying Rakshasa leaped across the lake, landing before the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree. It aimed its palm at the tree and the ripe fruit, its corpse energy wrapping around them.
Turning, its black eyes flashed with cold light, staring coldly at Qin Sang.


“Don’t you dare move, or I’ll destroy it!”

Qin Sang landed on the water, his face ashen. He finally remembered where he’d heard that voice before, and who its owner was.

“Yi Tiannie! You’re still alive!”

Yi Tiannie, the leader of the Kuiyin Sect.

Years ago, Yi Tiannie planted a soul-eating insect larva in Qin Sang’s soul, forcing him to infiltrate the Yuanzhao Sect as an undercover agent, leading to a series of calamities.  He was the first ruthlessly cruel fiend Qin Sang encountered, one he was powerless against, completely at his mercy.

Yi Tiannie was already nearing the end of his life back then.  In a desperate gamble, he stole the Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchid, a treasure of the Yuanzhao Sect, but was counter-attacked and killed by the Yuanzhao Sect leader when the leader detonated a powerful formation. It was said that not even his remains were left.

Qin Sang thought he’d long since gone to hell, but here he was, alive, possessing the Flying Night Rakshasa and ambushing him.

The Flying Night Rakshasa’s face contorted, revealing Yi Tiannie’s visage.

Even turned to ashes, Qin Sang would recognize that face!

“Daring to refine yourself into a corpse, using a corpse pill as an external elixir… how ruthless!”

Yi Tiannie let out a cackling laugh, then sighed, “My Kuiyin Sect… to produce such a character… even I misjudged him!  Back then, I declared him a useless boy, but he turned out to be a formidable one. Hiding within the righteous path, cultivating demonic arts, wiping out my entire Kuiyin Sect, using the corpse refinement technique on himself to disrupt my plans… the cultivation world will struggle to find another like him. No wonder you've achieved so much!”

Yi Tiannie’s tone held a hint of admiration.

Qin Sang felt no honor.  A burning rage filled his chest, like a volcano ready to erupt.  “Your soul… has been hiding within Yu Hua’s body all this time?”

Discovering that Yi Tiannie was possessing the Flying Night Rakshasa’s body made everything clear to Qin Sang.

Many previous doubts suddenly made sense. He recalled his encounters with Yu Hua.

In the Wuyagou Valley, Yu Hua had tracked him down using the soul-eating insect larva.  But at that time, Qin Sang was already suppressing the larva’s aura with the Void Yuan Seal, keeping it within a limited range, detectable only within that area.

Except for Yi Tiannie, the larva’s master.

The one who sensed him back then was likely not Yu Hua, but Yi Tiannie!

Furthermore, Yu Hua’s knowledge of the Kuiyin Sect’s remnants far surpassed what a Foundation Establishment cultivator should possess. He knew not only the whereabouts of those remnants but also the details and hiding place of the  Jiupao Daoist.
