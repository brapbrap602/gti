**Chapter 190: An Unexpected Surprise**

As the changes in 'Cloud Mountain Cultivator' became more and more apparent, making him look increasingly like a zombie, Qin Sang abruptly stopped and interrupted the Corpse Refining secret technique.

With a swift motion, he glanced at the Corpse Puppet Bag and summoned the pale gray cloud of condensed spirit ghosts with a flick of his wrist. With a slight movement of his divine sense, he extracted one spirit ghost.

The spirit ghost twisted in Qin Sang's hand, occasionally taking the shape of a fish. It was the spirit of a fish demon.

Qin Sang had only hunted lower-level ordinary demons, whose spiritual intelligence was not yet developed. The spirit ghosts' resistance was weak and would not disrupt his control over the Corpse Refining secret technique. However, it meant he would require a larger number of spirit ghosts, which would extend the refining time. This was a cautious approach, typical of Qin Sang's first time refining a corpse.

The second step of corpse refinement was next. There was no need for prolonged nourishment by yin qi. Instead, the spirits were directly refined into the refining body, forcibly granting it sentience.

Qin Sang seized the spirit ghost and formed hand seals once more. However, this time, the restraints were vastly different from before. As the restraints took shape, the spirit ghost gradually became enveloped and finally dissipated completely, merging into the restraints.

Qin Sang flicked his finger, sending the transparent restraints floating in front of him. A faint trace of pale gray qi could be seen lingering within.

He had not expected to succeed on the first try.

Qin Sang immediately summoned another spirit ghost and repeated the process. However, before the restraints could even form, the spirit ghost suddenly shattered.

Qin Sang's brow furrowed briefly before he casually flicked away the shattered spirit ghost and summoned another.

Not every attempt would be met with success. Fortunately, Qin Sang's divine sense was quite strong. As he grew more familiar with the secret technique, his success rate gradually increased to around seventy percent, which was considered efficient.

Time seemed to lose all meaning in the cave as Qin Sang focused entirely on refining the restraints. Before he knew it, most of the pale gray qi had been consumed, and a dense cluster of tiny restraints floated before him.

Finally, the last restraint was completed. Qin Sang's palm abruptly clenched, causing the restraints to converge. They initially appeared chaotic but quickly regrouped and formed a phantom 'human-shaped restraint' in mid-air.

The next step was to separate a wisp of his divine soul. According to the secret technique of the 'Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture', he would forge a soul imprint that could control the refined corpse and merge it with the restraints. This would be inscribed into the corpse.

Once the refinement was successful, he could use this soul imprint to subjugate the corpse and manipulate it to attack his enemies.

Separating his divine soul would injure his primordial spirit, but it could be restored by cultivating in seclusion for a few days. Qin Sang had long since grown accustomed to the sword qi devouring his divine soul. This minor pain was nothing to him. He swiftly separated a wisp of his divine soul from his primordial spirit and wasted no time in condensing the soul imprint.

When the soul imprint was successfully condensed, Qin Sang embedded it into the 'human-shaped' restraint before him. He then inscribed them both into 'Cloud Mountain Cultivator's' body.

As the restraints merged into his body, 'Cloud Mountain Cultivator' underwent further changes. His tightly shut eyes, which had remained closed previously, suddenly opened. His orbs were as black as ink, devoid of any whites. They could move and appear rather lively.

His deep, dark pupils stared straight ahead, filled with a hatred for all living beings and a thirst for blood that was utterly sinister.

At this moment, he had completely transformed into a zombie!

Qin Sang stored the remaining spirit ghosts in the Corpse Puppet Bag and glanced at 'Cloud Mountain Cultivator'. After a moment's hesitation, he issued a command for him to move.

'Cloud Mountain Cultivator' was exceptionally obedient. Qin Sang had him move to the left, and he did so without question. When instructed to turn to the right, he did so without hesitation, showing no signs of resistance or struggle.

'Poof!'

'Cloud Mountain Cultivator' clawed at the wall, dislodging a piece of rubble. He then handed it to Qin Sang as instructed, standing obediently before him without moving.

Qin Sang's expression grew increasingly astonished. This was vastly different from the description in the 'Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture'.

The 'Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture' warned corpse refiners that when a corpse was first refined and its sentience was nascent, it would instinctively resist its controller and might even attack.

At that time, the corpse refiner must swiftly solidify the soul imprint within the corpse, subdue it, and remain vigilant against a sneak attack until the corpse was completely under their control.

There were many cases of people successfully refining a corpse but being killed by it due to a moment of carelessness.

Qin Sang was not afraid of ordinary Zombies, but he was planning to subdue the cultivated Corpse in a straightforward manner. To his surprise, the "White Cloud Mountain Man" obeyed him unconditionally, without any resistance.

Qin Sang was both surprised and puzzled.

The "Heavenly Corpse Secret Manual" was the treasured secret of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, which had been proven by countless cases. The possibility of a mistake was extremely low.

The secret manual stated clearly that a cultivated Corpse resists control instinctively and that resistance would not change based on the strength of the controller. At most, a stronger cultivator could subdue a Corpse instantly.

Howeverâ€¦ an exception had just occurred here.

Qin Sang couldn't think of anything that made him special, besides the Jade Buddha.

The spiritual imprint was a wisp of the Primordial Spirit. Could it be that it also inherited the abilities of the Jade Buddha, and like the Primordial Spirit, could not be defied?

Could it be said that anybody or anything would never be able to resist him once they were under his control? Could they only submit to being enslaved?

A beam of light suddenly flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, and his heart started pounding with excitement. He felt as if there were a road leading to heaven before him!

It should be noted that there were many more secrets in the world of cultivation than just cultivated Corpse methods. The Controlling Spirit Sect had the technique to control monstrous beasts, and there was even an evil technique under the Demon Sect that allowed them to enslave and control cultivators.

As mysterious and unpredictable as the Jade Buddha was, if he could find a similar secret and embark on a path of enslavement, gain control over a Golden Elixir cultivator, wouldn't he have access to divine pills, wonderful medicines, magic treasures, and cultivation methods?

No! That's not right!

The excitement on Qin Sang's face disappeared suddenly.

He observed the spiritual imprint carefully and discovered that there was indeed a layer of yellow light on it, but it was extremely faint and difficult to detect unless he looked closely. Moreover, this layer of light was completely different from the indestructible aura of the Jade Buddha.

Qin Sang thought deeply after seeing this.

He estimated that the strength of the spiritual imprint was limited. The "White Cloud Mountain Man" had just been turned into a Zombie and had not yet absorbed evil energy, so its strength was probably only equivalent to a Qi Refining cultivator, so it had no power to resist.

According to Qin Sang, in the Controlling Spirit Sect's beast-taming method, the strength of the monstrous beast could not exceed that of the master, otherwise the monstrous beast would backlash against its master.

He could not be sure how strong the spiritual imprint's upper limit was, but it was definitely stronger than others. He had great confidence in the Jade Buddha's abilities.

Also, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall what happened at the branch of the Heavenly Corpse Sect. He had tried to subdue the living corpse using the secret manual, but he had failed. This showed that the Jade Buddha could indeed enhance the strength of the spiritual imprint, but on the premise that he could control the other party and imprint the spiritual imprint on them; this was precisely the most difficult step.

Although it was not as awesome as he had imagined, it could be considered an unexpected and pleasant surprise.
