<h1>Chapter 1534: Insect King (4k)</h1><p>He had seen countless poisonous insects, but this was the first time the Fat Silkworm had shown such an abnormal behavior.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped speaking and gazed outside the cave.</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu, not understanding why, dared not make a sound to disturb him.</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>The insect cloud approached.</p><p>The buzzing, strange sound was omnipresent, impossible to avoid. Whether it was the cry of the Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies or the sound of their wings vibrating, it was clearly audible even when hiding in the cave, making one feel restless and disturbed.</p><p>The strange sound was incessant. Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu realized that they were surrounded by countless ghostly insects. They inexplicably thought of the gruesome scene of being devoured by thousands of insects. A tingling, numb sensation seemed to seep from the depths of their bones, spreading throughout their bodies. They shivered, not daring to even breathe loudly.</p><p>The poisonous cloud was blocked outside by the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The swarm of insects also did not sense their aura.</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu initially thought they could escape this calamity.</p><p>Just then, the sound of the insect swarm suddenly changed, causing their hearts to tighten. They almost cried out in alarm.</p><p>'Buzz...Buzz...'</p><p>The cries suddenly became rapid, like the grinding of metal, sharp and piercing.</p><p>Moreover, the insect swarm seemed to have stopped above them. The sound was right next to their ears, constantly lingering.</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu's faces turned pale.</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently to the increasingly chaotic sounds, perceiving the situation outside. "The two insect clouds are not from the same group. They are fighting each other and happened to choose this place as their battlefield. The Skyrend Valley is so vast, there's no shortage of territory, yet they slaughter each other. Is it their bloodthirsty nature, or the growth method of this type of spirit insect...?"</p><p>The Fat Silkworm squirmed in Qin Sang's hand, eager to go out.</p><p>The thing that piqued its interest was inside the insect cloud.</p><p>Qin Sang did not act rashly.</p><p>In mid-air.</p><p>The two insect clouds collided. To outsiders, they looked identical.</p><p>The yellow poisonous clouds roiled, pressing against the sky. It was as if countless uncontrolled wild beasts were inside, rushing towards the center in droves, surging from all directions with wild power.</p><p>Inside the poisonous cloud, one could faintly see dots of yellow firefly light gathering together. Each point of firefly light was a Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly. The firefly light flickered, as if without substance, appearing very weak, like ghost fire.</p><p>No wonder they were called ghostly insects by the local cultivators.</p><p>The cries of the insect swarm fighting were like the whistling sound of the poisonous cloud.</p><p>Above and below, the poisonous cloud was everywhere, accumulating layer upon layer, becoming increasingly dense and oppressive.</p><p>Where the poisonous cloud covered, life was extinguished.</p><p>The vegetation remained, and the birds and beasts had no external injuries, but they had been eroded by the poisonous cloud. Their vitality, from the inside out, had been completely plundered by the insect cloud. A strong wind would blow them into flying ashes.</p><p>The screeching of the insect cloud initially erupted at extreme speed, quickly reaching a limit and entering a stalemate stage, then gradually weakening. This indicated that a victor had emerged between the two insect clouds. The weaker side was likely destined to be devoured.</p><p>Finally, the screeching subsided, and the battle entered its final stage.</p><p>However, the scale of the poisonous cloud did not diminish in the slightest.</p><p>The insect swarm began to move, continuing to plunder other areas. The poisonous cloud drifted away quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly moved at this moment, flashing out of the cave and appearing on the mountain top.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was a desolate, grey wasteland.</p><p>Qin Sang stared in the direction the insect cloud had left. The thing the Fat Silkworm sensed was indeed inside the insect cloud. He couldn't help but suspect that the previous bloodthirsty behavior of the insect swarm was due to a struggle for something.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang actively pursued the ghostly firefly insect cloud, which others would avoid at all costs, and soon approached the poisonous cloud.</p><p>The yellow poisonous cloud looked like a sandstorm.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Fat Silkworm to cover him with a poison-repelling armor, suppressed his aura, and merged into the poisonous cloud.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm swayed its chubby body on Qin Sang's shoulder, showing its current excitement. Every time a similar situation occurred, it was when it had discovered delicious food.</p><p>The poisonous cloud was blocked by the poison-repelling armor, thus posing no threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>Through the thick poisonous cloud, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly could already see the surging insect swarm inside. Countless Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies swarmed together, looking identical, like a long river of lights.</p><p>Besides the Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies, there was nothing else.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the Fat Silkworm's senses and looked at the target. There were only densely packed Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies. Could it be in the belly of one of the fireflies?</p><p>Just then, the flowing insect swarm suddenly paused and emitted a familiar screech.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an indescribable pressure. His heart sank, knowing that he had been detected by the insect swarm.</p><p>At this moment, the Fat Silkworm locked onto a Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly.</p><p>This firefly was no different from the others. Qin Sang was still baffled as to what was so special about it that attracted the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>However, this did not affect his actions.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer concealed himself and decisively launched a strong attack. His figure was as fast as lightning, instantly rushing to the edge of the insect cloud. He controlled the Gold-Sinking Sword and unleashed an extremely sharp sword energy with a wave of his hand.</p><p>The sword energy penetrated the insect swarm, like an ice sword piercing into a sea of fire. The flames surged, creating a circle of illusory fire rings.</p><p>The Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies killed by the Gold-Sinking Sword bloomed with their remaining radiance, a beauty that intoxicated the soul.</p><p>The Gold-Sinking Sword's momentum was unstoppable. It cleared a path through the insect swarm with a single strike, pointing directly at that special Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly.</p><p>The insect swarm seemed to react only then, and a furious screech shook the heavens, pouring into Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>Qin Sang was unmoved. Seeing how easily he had torn through the insect swarm, he naturally wouldn't let this opportunity pass. He charged into the insect swarm without hesitation and easily captured that Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly.</p><p>Before he could examine it carefully, the Fat Silkworm arched its body and pounced on Qin Sang's fingertip, as if afraid of someone snatching it away. It opened its mouth and swallowed it, rolling around contentedly.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that this Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly might be the Insect King of the swarm, which was why it attracted the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>If that was the case, it was too easy to obtain.</p><p>This thought had just flashed through his mind when Qin Sang felt something was amiss with the insect swarm.</p><p>The next moment, the surroundings suddenly became quiet. The screeching stopped abruptly.</p><p>The insect swarm underwent a strange change.</p><p>Previously, all the Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies in the swarm advanced and retreated together, sharing the same goal, and might even live and die together. But Qin Sang could clearly sense their individuality; each Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly existed independently.</p><p>Now it was different.</p><p>All the Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies merged into a whole.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling that he was no longer facing a swarm of spirit insects, but a giant monster.</p><p>Each Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly was like a node of the monster's thought, woven into a large net, completely connected.</p><p>The insect swarm collectively formed the monster, becoming one.</p><p>The monster surrounded Qin Sang, staring at him covetously.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an emotion from the insect swarm, a kind of greedy desire.</p><p>Not only did it have clear emotions, but these individually weak Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies, at this moment, transformed into a colossal being with a flaming body, posing a direct threat to him.</p><p>This threat did not come solely from the poisonous cloud.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, glancing at the Fat Silkworm, which had become completely stiff.</p><p>The insect swarm's target was clearly it!</p><p>Being watched by the insect swarm, the Fat Silkworm's previous arrogance vanished. It tried to protect its head and shrink its body, curling up in the gap between Qin Sang's fingers.</p><p>It regarded that Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly as a delicacy, never expecting that it also possessed something the insect swarm coveted. The hunter had instead become the prey.</p><p>The insect swarm was restless.</p><p>Facing this scene, Qin Sang showed no fear. He flicked his sleeve, and Demonic Fire surged out, instantly forming a ring of fire around him.</p><p>The aura of the Demonic Fire permeated the air.</p><p>This was one of the top-tier spirit flames in the world.</p><p>The insect swarm stirred. Qin Sang sensed fear and hesitation again. The insect swarm could indeed think, but it was still very simple, expressing its emotional changes outwardly.</p><p>But this was not enough to scare them away.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, activating the Sun God Tree, and releasing a trace of the Southern Brightfire's aura.</p><p>As expected, the ghostly firefly lights within the insect swarm began to shake violently. All the Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies flapped their wings in unison, and the screeching resounded through heaven and earth once more.</p><p>This time, the insect cries were not as sharp and piercing, but incredibly chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but frown. He completely failed to understand the insect swarm's intentions. Unwilling to engage in a pointless battle with the insect swarm, he was about to leave when he saw the Fat Silkworm peek its head out from between his fingers, sneaking its head out, revealing a surprised expression, and screaming wildly at the insect swarm.</p><p>"Are they communicating?"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the Fat Silkworm's sly eyes and a thought struck him.</p><p>The cries had no definite meaning. This communication was clearly not through sound, but perhaps direct communication at the level of their thoughts.</p><p>He did not speak, silently cooperating with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe the insect swarm.</p><p>His gaze swept over each Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang locked onto a Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly hidden within the swarm. Its figure was faint and ethereal, more fleeting than the other fireflies, yet it seemed to be the focal point of the entire swarm.</p><p>"There really is an Insect King!"</p><p>Qin Sang understood the reason.</p><p>A true Insect King had been born in the swarm, which was why the swarm had undergone such a change!</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, thoughts racing through his mind. He secretly observed the movement patterns of that Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly, capturing an opportunity.</p><p>Without any warning, the Demonic Fire suddenly burst forth!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Demonic Fire dragon plunged into the insect swarm.</p><p>An incongruous black spot appeared within the swarm, as if something had bitten off a large chunk of flesh. The insect cries became rapid and sharp again, but this time with a sense of pain.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure moved with the Demonic Fire.</p><p>He would not move unless necessary, but when he did, he moved with the force of a thunderbolt!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Demonic Fire's momentum did not diminish, instantly engulfing a large swath of Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a dazzling sword light shone at the front of the Demonic Fire dragon. The Gold-Sinking Sword thrust out, transforming into a sword array as soon as it appeared.</p><p>That Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly sensed the danger, and its figure immediately became illusory, but it was still a step too late. Before it could escape, the surrounding space darkened, and it was trapped within the sword array.</p><p>'Squeak...Squeak...'</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang succeed in one strike, the Fat Silkworm cried out triumphantly, wagging its head and tail.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression, however, did not show much joy, because the insect swarm did not become agitated or panicked because of the Insect King being trapped. The screeching continued as before.</p><p>He stared at the Insect King within the sword array.</p><p>The next moment, the Insect King indeed underwent a transformation. It was forced to reveal itself, but its aura changed, becoming identical to that of other ordinary Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly stunned.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's triumphant cries stopped abruptly, revealing an incredulous look.</p><p>"The Insect King can freely occupy the bodies of its kind, or perhaps, the Insect King is not within the swarm, but hidden elsewhere, controlling the swarm..."</p><p>Confirming that the Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly indeed had no abnormalities, Qin Sang thought of various possibilities. He had the Heavenly Eye Butterfly search again, and indeed found another Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly undergoing this change, becoming the new 'Insect King'.</p><p>Just then, the screeching of the insect swarm began to become rapid, as if urging and threatening something.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was awakened by the cries. It gnashed its teeth and emitted a sharp cry, but it stubbornly refused to leave, while looking at Qin Sang pleadingly.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed his divine sense and the Heavenly Eye神通 to the limit, but could not find the true Insect King's trace. He had no choice but to repeat his previous tactic.</p><p>This time, his calculations were even more precise. The Demonic Fire, the sword array, and even the Soul-Seizing Incantation were used, cooperating seamlessly.</p><p>That 'Insect King' indeed had nowhere to escape and was caught by Qin Sang.</p><p>However, the same scene occurred.</p><p>Right under Qin Sang's nose, the 'Insect King's' aura completely disappeared, leaving no trace. Qin Sang had been constantly locking onto it with his divine sense, yet he could not sense the source.</p><p>At the same time, a brand new 'Insect King' was born within the swarm.</p><p>Qin Sang was helpless and shook his head at the Fat Silkworm. Only by slaughtering the entire swarm could he possibly find the Insect King, but this was something the Fat Silkworm was unwilling to do.</p><p>He also wasn't certain. The insect swarm was eager to trade something with the Fat Silkworm and had not launched a real attack against them. It was still unclear what strange神通 the insect swarm possessed.</p><p>Furthermore, if the Insect King was hidden elsewhere, controlling the swarm from a distance, even using the Sun God Tree would likely be futile in finding it.</p><p>He even suspected that the previous battle between the two insect clouds might have been manipulated by the true Insect King from behind the scenes.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was full of disappointment, its eyes mournful.</p><p>Then, the Fat Silkworm turned its head and cried out at the insect swarm.</p><p>It raised its head high, its body tensed, stretching almost twice its length. It emitted a wailing sound, faintly revealing a hint of pain, and with great difficulty, spat out a ball of multicolored aura.</p><p>It looked somewhat similar to the multicolored halo that made up the poison-repelling armor, but more condensed, seemingly the Fat Silkworm's innate source power.</p><p>After spitting out the multicolored aura, the Fat Silkworm was noticeably weakened. Listlessly, it pushed the aura out, suspending it in mid-air.</p><p>The screeching paused for a moment, then the insect swarm wriggled. The 'Insect King' emerged from the crowd and approached the multicolored aura.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm bared its teeth, issuing a warning.</p><p>The 'Insect King' stopped, facing Qin Sang and the Fat Silkworm from a distance. Its flame-like body began to swell, becoming the size of a fist. Then the firelight split open in the middle, and it spat out a yellow, crystal-clear stone, flinging it towards the Fat Silkworm, while simultaneously pouncing towards the multicolored aura.</p><p>The crystal was clear and translucent, like amber.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen this kind of amber insect crystal before.</p><p>The amber insect crystal seemed to have appeared out of thin air. The entire process was fully displayed before them, yet Qin Sang could not sense the source of the crystal.</p><p>"I actually witnessed a transaction between spirit insects."</p><p>Although Qin Sang had traveled far and wide and seen many things, this was the first time he had seen such a scene, and it felt truly marvelous.</p><p>The world was vast, full of wonders!</p><p>Seeing the crystal, the Fat Silkworm perked up, its eyes shining. It sprang up, hugging the crystal, as if it had obtained a treasure.</p><p>It was clearly unscrupulous. Having obtained the crystal, it immediately went back on its word, screaming repeatedly, seemingly urging Qin Sang to take action and snatch back the multicolored aura.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang did take action.</p><p>The sword array did not miss. It easily sealed off that 'Insect King', but the familiar scene occurred again.</p><p>All the divine properties of the 'Insect King' faded away, turning it back into an ordinary Corrosive Phosphorescent Firefly, and the multicolored aura disappeared along with it.</p><p>The multicolored light vanished before their eyes, without a trace.</p><p>Then, the aura of the insect swarm receded like a tide, returning to the previous ghostly firefly cloud. Ignoring Qin Sang and the furious Fat Silkworm, it drifted away quickly, disappearing into the depths of the Skyrend Valley.</p>
