<h1>Chapter 1152: Passers-by of the Past</h1><p>A moment later, the great demons arrived one after another.  </p><p>What caught Qin Sang's attention the most were the Fat Chicken and the White Crane. In just a few short months, the two had become inseparable, shoulder to shoulder, exuding a roguish air.  </p><p>"Master!"  </p><p>The White Crane landed on the ground, fluffed its feathers with a flourish, and grinned foolishly at Qin Sang.  </p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned and glanced at the Fat Chicken.  </p><p>"My brother!"  </p><p>The Fat Chicken extended a wing, wrapping it around the White Crane with a sense of camaraderie.  </p><p>Qin Sang inwardly sighed. It was indeed this guy.  </p><p>The Emperor's Nectar that Wanderer Yun had left behind had long been destroyed in the heavenly tribulation.  </p><p>The Fat Chicken had a mother who had reached the Transformation Stage, so it wasn’t surprising that he carried some Emperor's Nectar.  </p><p>However, even Transformation Stage demons were reluctant to part with too much Emperor's Nectar to enlighten lesser demons. Yet, the Fat Chicken had willingly used it on the White Crane, whom he had only recently met.  </p><p>These two birds, gluttonous and lustful, truly were birds of a feather!  </p><p>"In the future, when seeking a Dao companion, make sure not to choose a descendant of the Phoenix Clan," Qin Sang earnestly advised the Fat Chicken, his tone meaningful.  </p><p>The Fat Chicken was momentarily confused.  </p><p>The White Crane’s eyes darted around before he turned and wrapped a wing around the Fat Chicken, declaring with righteous fervor, "A brother's wife is not to be coveted!"  </p><p>...  </p><p>Qin Sang had no time to deal with the two birds for now. If they dared to cause trouble for him in the future, he would certainly discipline them properly.  </p><p>At present, both the Primordial Unity Ring and the White Crane were of little use to Qin Sang. He decided to release the White Crane from its bindings and let it remain in the Thousand Bamboo Sea.  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Liu, has anything major happened recently?" Qin Sang asked, turning to the Willow Spirit.  </p><p>The Willow Spirit spoke with a heavy tone, "There have been a few skirmishes on the front lines. It’s said that the momentum of the Sin Abyss has slowed again, their movements elusive and hard to pin down. The Old Macaque has already personally led his troops to the Immortal-Demon City to join forces with other demon kings and head to the battlefield. Aside from that, the Feather Demon King has issued no new orders."  </p><p>"They’ve already left?" Qin Sang frowned, knowing he couldn’t stop such matters.  </p><p>The best way to reduce casualties was to shatter the ambitions of the Sin Abyss.  </p><p>"You need not worry. I’ve decided to begin my attempt to break through to the Nascent Soul Stage. Once I succeed, I will personally go to the battlefield to take a look."  </p><p>At these words, the demons erupted in murmurs.  </p><p>"This old one will go and activate the formation..." the Willow Spirit began, but Qin Sang stopped him.  </p><p>"The heavenly tribulations of humans and demons are different. I cannot undergo my tribulation in the Thousand Bamboo Sea. The Yun Cang Great Marsh is the best choice. Although I have considerable confidence, I must prepare for the worst. There are some matters I need to entrust to you all."  </p><p>Qin Sang spoke gravely.  </p><p>His deep concern for the Thousand Bamboo Sea and the demons stemmed from Wanderer Yun’s final words.  </p><p>Hearing this, the demons’ expressions turned solemn.  </p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the group and issued a series of commands.  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Liu, Little Bai, if I fail to overcome the tribulation and am unable to fulfill the elder’s wishes, you must not remain in the Thousand Bamboo Sea. Retreat to the Ice Sea as quickly as possible and hide for as long as you can."  </p><p>"White Crane, I grant you your freedom, but you must assist Fellow Daoist Liu and Little Bai until they are safe."  </p><p>"Fat Chicken, we’ve known each other for a long time. I know your origins and background. If I perish in the heavenly tribulation, the previous conditions will be nullified, and I won’t force you to stay. But you must promise me one thing: if Fellow Daoist Liu and the others encounter danger, you must seek help from your mother and ask her to intervene on their behalf once."  </p><p>The Fat Chicken chuckled dryly, "Master, you’re being too cautious. You’re already daring enough to challenge the Puppeteer Demon King. A mere heavenly tribulation shouldn’t be a problem, right?"  </p><p>The Willow Spirit and the White Cat were far less optimistic.  </p><p>They had been traumatized by Wanderer Yun’s two failed attempts at overcoming the tribulation.  </p><p>The White Cat’s eyes were filled with worry as she timidly asked, "Young Master Qin, may I accompany you to the Yun Cang Great Marsh to guard you during your tribulation?"  </p><p>Qin Sang did not refuse. After a moment’s thought, he said, "Very well. Fat Chicken, White Crane, you will come with me as well. I have a few juniors among the humans whom you should meet. Fellow Daoist Liu, you will stay behind..."  </p><p>...  </p><p>After making the necessary arrangements, Qin Sang and Bai set off with the three demons, returning to human territory.  </p><p>This time, Qin Sang traveled at his fastest speed, crossing mountain ranges and heading straight for the Great Sui direction.  </p><p>The three were all present.  </p><p>Bai Hanqiu was in seclusion, attempting to break through the Foundation Establishment bottleneck.  </p><p>Li Yufu, after some travels, had finally gained some insights and returned to his cave abode.  </p><p>Tan Yi’en’s cultivation had also made significant progress.  </p><p>When Qin Sang returned, the three immediately emerged from seclusion to greet him.  </p><p>Qin Sang introduced the three demons to them, inspected their cultivation progress, offered some guidance, bestowed a few treasures, and then revealed his plans.  </p><p>The three were momentarily stunned, feeling both joy and worry.  </p><p>Qin Sang made it clear that if he failed to overcome the tribulation, he would entrust Tan Yi’en and Bai Hanqiu to Li Yufu, who would later join the Green Goat Temple.  </p><p>They did not linger for long.  </p><p>A few days later, the group headed to the Yun Cang Great Marsh, with Li Yufu accompanying them.  </p><p>Qin Sang made a trip to Cangheng Island, while the others spread out to search. It didn’t take long before they found a suitable island for the tribulation.  </p><p>"Such a grand mobilization! So many people guarding me during my tribulation."  </p><p>Qin Sang and Bai stood side by side on a mountain on the island, sighing with emotion.  </p><p>Bai chuckled softly, "Others may not know your true strength, but I do. You’re being overly cautious, making everyone else nervous!"  </p><p>Qin Sang shook his head without speaking.  </p><p>The secret of his origins was something Bai could never know.  </p><p>Wanderer Yun had been an anomaly, and Qin Sang himself was not normal either. Although Qin Sang believed he wouldn’t encounter something like a dual-colored heavenly tribulation, with his cautious nature, he had to make preparations for the worst.  </p><p>"Thank you all for your efforts!"  </p><p>Qin Sang clasped his fists in gratitude.  </p><p>Bai nodded and led the others away from the island, standing guard on the periphery.  </p><p>Qin Sang first set up a protective spirit formation around the mountain peak, then took out twelve demon banners and planted them in the ground around him.  </p><p>The Twelve Demon Banner Formation was one of Qin Sang’s key preparations for the tribulation.  </p><p>Next, bottles of pills and various magical treasures were neatly arranged and ready for use at any moment.  </p><p>With the external preparations complete, Qin Sang took out the Tribulation Transcendence Pill and gazed at it intently.  </p><p>"Elder..."  </p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang lowered his gaze and let out an almost imperceptible sigh. He did not rush to take the pill but slowly closed his eyes.  </p><p>Back in the Thousand Bamboo Sea, he had wondered whether the Four Transformations Spirit Insect or the fourth layer of body refinement would be more effective.  </p><p>Qin Sang had successfully sensed a sliver of the opportunity for a breakthrough. This opportunity was extremely precious, and he could use it to take the pill and attempt to break through the bottleneck.  </p><p>Everything was ready; all that was needed was the final push.  </p><p>After some contemplation, Qin Sang decided not to wait any longer.  </p><p>His mind was calm as he adjusted his state, starting from the beginning and repeatedly refining his cultivation techniques.  </p><p>It took him a full three days.  </p><p>Qin Sang’s dantian was filled with true essence, and his body was brimming with vitality. Both his physical body and true essence had been adjusted to their peak condition.  </p><p>But this alone was not enough. Qin Sang still did not rush to take the next step.  </p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang’s thoughts drifted, recalling the past and returning to the place of his birth.  </p><p>Scenes from the depths of his memory surfaced in his mind—the faces and voices of his loved ones. Everything had happened over two hundred years ago, and even with his cultivation, these memories were beginning to blur.  </p><p>"All are but passers-by..."  </p><p>Qin Sang recalled the words of his senior sister, Qing Jun.  </p><p>Having embarked on the path of cultivation, Qin Sang had long since come to understand this truth. His heart remained unperturbed as he continued to refine his cultivation path. These were the things that truly mattered.  </p><p>******</p>
