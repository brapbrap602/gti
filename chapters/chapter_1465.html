<h1>Chapter 1457: Reunion (4k, Two-in-One)</h1><p>“He caused you such heartache.  Despite your unparalleled talent and divine potential, you wasted years. You endured the pain of unrequited love, painstakingly cultivating the Ice Soul Radiance. Yet he didn't appear sooner or later, but chose the crucial moment of your mastery to disrupt your Dao heart.  His heart deserves punishment!”</p><p>Shi Xue was indignant, denouncing the heartless man.</p><p>Especially since, upon seeing her junior sister, he tried to attack her.  He was utterly heartless and unfeeling, betraying her unwavering devotion.</p><p>Liuli's eyes flickered strangely.  Waiting for Shi Xue to finish her tirade, she softly said, "I need to go out."</p><p>Shi Xue sniffed, gazing deeply at her junior sister, frowning, "That man is so cruel, and you still want to see him?  Why not let the Grand Elder and the Hunmo Elder kill him, ending this calamitous affair!"</p><p>Liuli remained silent.</p><p>They looked at each other for a while.</p><p>Shi Xue, knowing her junior sister's stubborn nature – once she made a decision, no amount of persuasion would change her mind – reluctantly waved her hand. "Go, go!"</p><p>She sat huffily on the meditation cushion, a mix of exasperation and helplessness on her face.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Liuli rose, lightly touched the ground, leaving behind an ice statue. Reaching the door, she paused slightly. "I will persuade him to return the sacred artifact."</p><p>With that, Liuli's figure blurred, leaving silently.</p><p>A long sigh echoed in the quiet room.</p><p>…</p><p>On the reef.</p><p>Qin Sang worked diligently for a while, setting up an array.</p><p>Then, he flew east, searching, quickly finding the place Chen Yan had described.</p><p>There were seven small islands, arranged like the Big Dipper.  The largest was only a thousand zhang in diameter; the smallest resembled large rocks.</p><p>From a high vantage point, Qin Sang surveyed the area before landing on the largest island.</p><p>The island was uninhabited, with beautiful scenery.</p><p>He casually sat under an ancient tree, closing his eyes to rest.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt something, his eyes snapping open, looking east.</p><p>The bright moon.</p><p>A figure, clad in white, gracefully approached, like a fairy emerging from the waves – Chen Yan.  She came alone, no one else in sight.</p><p>With his greatly enhanced spiritual sense and the abilities of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, it was difficult for any disguise to deceive him.</p><p>He looked at this familiar yet unfamiliar figure, his expression complex.  He stood up, straightened his clothes, released his aura, and walked out of the forest.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew.</p><p>Liuli stopped her flight, landing lightly on the shore. Her cold eyes turned to Qin Sang's unmasked face.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly met her gaze, observing the only woman he'd ever been intimate with.  The passage of time hadn't left a single mark on her stunning beauty, as captivating as their first encounter.  Though, back then, he'd been more terrified.</p><p>Even having only met twice, Qin Sang could see a clear change in her; her aura was even colder than before, like an iceberg.</p><p>After a long silence.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind her, breaking the silence. "I didn't expect you to come yourself."</p><p>"There's no hatred between us."</p><p>Liuli's tone was flat.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, sighing. "Yes, back then, thanks to the fairy's intervention, I escaped the clutches of Dongyang Bo's scheme.  Chen Yan… that must have been an alias?"</p><p>"You created the opportunity; I counterattacked – it was for my own benefit."</p><p>Liuli said earnestly, taking no credit.</p><p>She didn't ask how Qin Sang had escaped or where he'd been hiding all those years.  After a pause, she said, "Chen Yan was a common name. My master took me in and named me Liuli."</p><p>"Liuli…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked into her eyes, as clear as glass, unsure of what to say. He took out the mysterious ice box and, clearing his throat, said with a chuckle, "The fairy gave me the ice pearl.  Aren't you worried I might figure out how to bypass the seal and keep it?"</p><p>Chen Yan seemed not to catch Qin Sang's teasing tone, replying seriously, "My cultivation method is unique; others can't replicate it. If I didn't help you isolate the seal, you would suspect."</p><p>I know why you did that, no need to be so formal.</p><p>And answering one question at a time, communicating with this ice queen is really a hassle. I don't know if that's her original personality, or if it's the result of all those changes and hardships.</p><p>Qin Sang grumbled inwardly, thinking about the past, he and Liuli suffered from similar pain.</p><p>Sighing inwardly, Qin Sang collected his thoughts and said seriously, "Fair maiden, are you trying to persuade me to return this object?"</p><p>Seeing Liuli nod, Qin Sang curiously asked, "How do you plan to persuade me? What's in it for me?"</p><p>"I can help you make a fair exchange."</p><p>Liuli's gaze fell upon the ice box.</p><p>Fair exchange.</p><p>Qin Sang believed she understood that fairness was relative, and after a moment's thought, asked, "Do you mean you'll tell me its origin and value, and what Xuan Tian Palace is willing to offer?"</p><p>Liuli nodded slightly.  Without waiting for Qin Sang to press further, she explained, "This is a sacred object of Xuan Tian Palace."</p><p>A sacred object!</p><p>Qin Sang was solemn. No wonder Xuan Tian Palace made such a fuss.  As the founder of a sect, Qin Sang understood very well that something revered as a sacred object by a sect might not be the most unique treasure in the world, but it was certainly extremely important to the sect, and in severe cases, even related to its survival.</p><p>Once a sacred object is lost, the sect would spare no effort to retrieve it.  If the seal hadn't been difficult to break, giving them some leeway, Xuan Tian Palace would have already gone mad and created a huge disturbance.</p><p>"What's sealed inside, and what is its purpose?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>He expected Liuli to be somewhat reserved.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Liuli showed no hesitation or reluctance.  "The sacred object is the key to the Sacred Land."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, "So that's it," and asked, "Is the Sacred Land some kind of hidden realm, or what?"</p><p>Liuli shook her head. To explain clearly, she added, "The environment inside the Sacred Land is unique, and it offers special benefits for certain cultivation methods, but I've never been inside. The Sacred Land was supposed to open recently, but the theft of the sacred object caused a delay."</p><p>She seemed to have not spoken so much in a long time, and her speech was slow.</p><p>Qin Sang listened carefully, then fell into thought. The "accident" Liuli referred to must have been Gui Mu's infiltration of Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Could Gui Mu's intentions be related to the Sacred Land?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more likely it seemed. If she only wanted the nautical chart, she could have simply come to the door; there was no need to sneak in and cause a commotion in Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Thinking this, he didn't ask directly, deciding to probe indirectly.</p><p>"Most people in Xuan Tian Palace cultivate ice-based techniques?" Qin Sang asked. If it only benefited cultivators of this type, the Sacred Land of Xuan Tian Palace would be of little use to him.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Liuli returned to her taciturn state, confirming the matter.</p><p>"Since it's a key, why did that person betray Xuan Tian Palace and steal the sacred object? Did they want to monopolize the Sacred Land?" Qin Sang sensed something strange. The sacred object must have more than one function.</p><p>"The entrance to the Sacred Land is a restricted area; outsiders can't enter."</p><p>Liuli first dispelled Qin Sang's idea of infiltrating the Sacred Land himself, then said, "It's an Ice Demon Crystal."</p><p>"An Ice Demon Crystal?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, lowering his head in thought.  He hadn't seen any records related to this treasure in the various classics he'd read.</p><p>"The crystal core left behind after an Ice Demon's death."</p><p>Liuli paused slightly, noticing Qin Sang's confusion. "Ice Demons are unique, naturally born spirits. Cultivators who transform into Ice Demon bodies and refine Ice Demon Crystals have the hope of achieving a complete Ice Demon body and advancing to the late Yuan Ying stage."</p><p>Upon hearing the words "Ice Demon body," Qin Sang immediately thought of the peculiar spirit body of the man in white.</p><p>No wonder that person betrayed his sect and stole the sacred object.  In the current cultivation world, the late Yuan Ying stage was a peak existence; the temptation was immense.</p><p>After some deliberation, Qin Sang asked, "Is the Ice Demon body a secret technique for cultivating the primordial spirit?"</p><p>Liuli wasn't surprised that Qin Sang knew this, since the traitor had likely died at his hands. She corrected him, "It's not a secret technique; it's a spiritual cultivation method. The primordial spirit transforms into an Ice Demon, existing as a spirit body."</p><p>Such a cultivation method really existed!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he quickly asked for details.</p><p>Liuli spoke a little more smoothly than before, "After cultivating the Ice Demon body, the primordial spirit absorbs the essence of the physical body, transforming into an Ice Demon spirit body. The physical body becomes a container, which can be refined into something like a lifebound treasure or a puppet. This method is flawed; only part of the Yuan Ying remains. Only ice-based cultivators can forcibly cultivate it, and it is extremely dangerous, easily leading to loss of control. It's a nine-death-one-life gamble; one should not attempt it unless driven to desperation."</p><p>It was a mix of explanation and warning.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about losing control.</p><p>But abandoning his physical body to exist as a spirit body was unacceptable to him.  Years of cultivation, his entire cultivation base, and the physical body he had diligently refined using star energy, would all have to be discarded.</p><p>Based on his experience, simultaneous cultivation in three systems was the right path. The Ice Demon body was purely spiritual cultivation, even more extreme than the current method of Dharma cultivation.</p><p>Furthermore, refining the Ice Demon Crystal only offered a chance to advance to the late stage, which held little appeal for him.</p><p>He had ample time to prepare for his breakthrough to late-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>If it were a chance at becoming a Hua Shen, he might have hesitated.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the thought and continued to ask, "Is that the only use of the Ice Demon Crystal?"</p><p>Liuli spoke more smoothly, candidly saying, "The Ice Demon Crystal is related to the Holy Land, a secret known to few in Xuan Tian Palace.  My master once told me it's kept in the Never-Freezing Spring within the forbidden area.  It absorbs the power of the cold spring, its spirit extinguished, equivalent to a dead object. It has three uses: one, cultivation into an Ice Demon body; two, allowing a Ghost King to merge with it, potentially transforming directly into an Ice Demon if it survives the impact; three, strengthening the bloodline of a fellow demon cultivator through refinement."</p><p>Finally, she added, "It's just speculation, unverified."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>The ghost spirit controlled by the Hun Mo Elder was undoubtedly a Ghost King-level being, and the Ice Demon Crystal held significant appeal for him. This explained Xuan Tian Palace's precautions against the Hun Mo Elder.</p><p>At least, for now, there was no need to worry about Xuan Tian Palace and the Hun Mo Elder joining forces to retrieve the sacred object.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, looking down at the ice box in his hand, thoughtfully saying, "So, unless I want to cultivate an Ice Demon body, or possess a Ghost King servant, this sacred object is useless to me."</p><p>He didn't entirely believe Liuli's words, but reviewing their conversation, he found no loopholes.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't delve deeper. He believed Liuli had ulterior motives, and if she had deceived him about anything, she would reveal flaws.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Liuli emphasized, "You are very dangerous!"</p><p>Does she mean that possessing the Ice Demon Crystal is dangerous?</p><p>Qin Sang looked up into Liuli's eyes.  Her gaze remained clear and calm, giving no clue to her thoughts.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang chuckled softly, saying, "I hear the Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace is in poor condition and cannot easily take action. Besides him, how many people could threaten me?"</p><p>A flicker of surprise appeared in Liuli's eyes, amazed that Qin Sang knew so much about the Xuan Tian Palace's Palace Master.</p><p>"That's not hard to guess. Xuan Tian Palace lost a sacred object, yet the Palace Master doesn't appear. Either he's unable to act, or there's something more important. What could be more important than the Holy Land? Or are you planning to join forces with the Hun Mo Elder?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mention knowing about Gui Mu's attack on Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>He didn't know what Gui Mu had done in Xuan Tian Palace. If she had injured the Palace Master, or stolen some treasure, and Xuan Tian Palace mistakenly blamed him, it would be unfair.</p><p>Liuli nodded almost imperceptibly, acknowledging Qin Sang's assessment. After a silent moment, she said, "Not for now."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.  As he had predicted, Xuan Tian Palace would initially try to negotiate with him, and wouldn't risk cooperating with the Hun Mo Elder unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"If not the Palace Master and the Hun Mo Elder, then who?" Qin Sang curiously asked.</p><p>"The Grand Elder."</p><p>Liuli added an explanation, "Before the Wan Mo Assembly, the Grand Elder received news that a traitor had clashed with a Demon King, and the sacred object might have fallen into the hands of the demon race.  She went to the Demon Realm alone."</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned for a moment, immediately guessing the source of the news, and couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>It must have been Feng Shangshi.  Unwilling to have worked for nothing, believing the treasure had fallen into the Demon King's hands, he deliberately spread this news to attract Xuan Tian Palace and cause trouble for Bi Fang.</p><p>Qin Sang had overheard Feng Shangshi and the others discussing using others to kill each other without endangering themselves, leading to great chaos near Fengyang Mountain, so they wouldn't widely publicize it.  The news only recently reached Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Did the Grand Elder find Bi Fang?</p><p>If Bi Fang knew the truth, he would be furious.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of Bi Fang hiding in his cave, misfortune striking, and felt a surge of schadenfreude, laughing inwardly for a while.  "Is the Grand Elder also a Grand Cultivator?"</p><p>He once again marveled at the deep foundation of Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>On the surface, the Palace Master held sway over the world, but secretly, there was a Grand Elder. If not for Gui Mu's interference, even if the traitor had planned it long ago, he wouldn't have had the chance to steal the sacred object.</p><p>An idea struck him.  Could the Grand Elder be her master?</p><p>Intrigued by the sacred object, Qin Sang had forgotten to ask how she resolved her feud with Dongyang Bo, and whether she had rescued her master.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Liuli's answer was unexpected. Before Qin Sang could ask, she continued, "The Grand Elder has long reached the peak of mid-Yuan Ying stage, her spirit sense having taken form, not weaker than you. She once suffered from demonic obsession, leaving hidden problems that caused her to fail in her breakthrough to late-Yuan Ying, thus being stuck at the bottleneck."</p><p>One foot in the late-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Spirit sense taking form.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind conjured up a figure – Mu Lao Mo of Canglang Sea!</p><p>Not counting Ye Lao Mo, who could suppress his cultivation using a clone, or his elusive senior sister, Mu Lao Mo was the strongest cultivator Qin Sang had ever seen below Grand Cultivator level.</p><p>The Grand Elder, backed by Xuan Tian Palace, might be even stronger than Mu Lao Mo.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Liuli paused, solemnly saying, "The Grand Elder possesses a spiritual treasure!"</p>
