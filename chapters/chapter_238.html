<h1>Chapter 231: Crisis</h1><p>Chapter 231: Crisis</p><p>Sword auras intersected, forming an oblique "+" shape that seemingly aimed to encircle and kill Qin Sang.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had never let his guard down and remained alert. His heart pounded when he sensed gusts of wind on either side of him, and he drew back suddenly, narrowly avoiding the two sword auras.</p><p>Although he hadn't been injured by the sword auras, Qin Sang had clearly sensed their power.</p><p>This was definitely at the level of Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. The trial had just begun, but he was already facing two Foundation Establishment Golden Armored Generals at once. Just how terrifying would the later trials be?</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>The Golden Armored Generals reacted extremely quickly; the moment Qin Sang retreated, they suddenly disappeared from their spots and reappeared right in front of him. The long swords in their hands swept upwards, two sword auras in hot pursuit, heading straight for Qin Sang's chest with undiminished power.</p><p>What an odd movement technique!</p><p>Qin Sang calmly stepped back as a sword light flashed between his brows.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to test the Golden Armored Generals' abilities, so he didn't use the sword formation right away. He simply released the Green Wood Sword. The spirit sword erupted with a sword aura several feet long that slashed across the air, meeting the Golden Armored Generals head-on.</p><p>The current Qin Sang was no longer the same as when he had just entered the Foundation Establishment stage. His scarlet sword aura was as thick as blood, carrying with it a terrifying killing intent. Under Qin Sang's control, he struck at the weak points of the two sword auras and managed to hold his own despite being outnumbered.</p><p>The three sword auras collided, then offset each other, with the aftermath dissipating in mid-air.</p><p>The killing intent released by the killing symbol poured down on the two Golden Armored Generals without reservation, but they didn't react at all, nor did their movements pause for a moment. Qin Sang was the only one in their eyes. Their sword shadows flickered before stabbing out again. It was like lightning, with the intent to not rest until Qin Sang was dead.</p><p>As expected, they were dead things!</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, knowing that the killing symbol wouldn't be able to deter the Golden Armored Generals, and the Ghostly Threads of the Ten Directions Yama Array might not work either. The only solution was force.</p><p>"Clang! Clang!"</p><p>Several more sword auras clashed, their echoes resonating far down the corridor.</p><p>The figures of Qin Sang and the Golden Armored Generals were like ghosts, transforming into streaks of golden light and illusions that repeatedly intersected and separated within the narrow corridor.</p><p>Qin Sang flitted between the two Golden Armored Generals, seemingly in great danger, but the confidence on his face grew with each passing moment.</p><p>After a few exchanges, Qin Sang had figured out the Golden Armored Generals' strengths and weaknesses in the blink of an eye. Although their movement technique and sword auras were on par with Foundation Establishment cultivators, they only had three basic techniques and lacked the various methods of cultivators.</p><p>Furthermore, they were, after all, dead things with only one goal: to kill the intruder. In Qin Sang's eyes, these Golden Armored Generals were extremely clumsy and rigid. Their true strength was far from comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Nevertheless, Qin Sang didn't take them lightly, as this was only the beginning of the Trial Path. The strength of the generals would definitely increase as they progressed.</p><p>"Activate the sword formation!"</p><p>Having figured out the Golden Armored Generals' strengths and weaknesses, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't hold back any longer.</p><p>Sword auras rapidly split and the A Thousand Mechanisms Sword Formation was deployed. The circular sword formation surrounded the two Golden Armored Generals. In order to prevent them from using that strange movement technique to escape the sword formation, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to activate it immediately.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The sword light was dazzling!</p><p>Bolstered by the sword formation, the Green Wood Sword's speed skyrocketed. The generals tried to block it with their swords, but they couldn't keep up with its speed at all, their attacks hitting nothing but air. The Green Wood Sword flashed and appeared in front of their chests.</p><p>The armor on the general's body wasn't as solid as he had imagined. It was easily pierced by the Green Wood Sword. A few streaks of blood flashed as the Green Wood Sword pierced back and forth, and the armor was immediately riddled with holes.</p><p>However, it was as if the Golden Armored Generals hadn't been injured at all. They even ignored the Green Wood Sword and charged towards Qin Sang. The golden light on their armor flickered, and the damaged areas repaired themselves at a visible rate.</p><p>"Where's their weak point?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. Just now, the Green Wood Sword had pierced their chests, throats, and heads, but it had failed to kill them, showing that these Golden Armored Generals couldn't be approached with common sense.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was thinking, there was a sudden crisp sound.</p><p>The Green Wood Sword's shadow flickered and appeared on the general's abdomen. Just as it was about to pierce through, the golden light on the general's body suddenly surged towards that spot, forming a round shield that looked like a heart protective mirror.</p><p>The heart protective mirror took shape just in time to block the Green Wood Sword's attack. This general also stopped moving as if he had just realized what was happening, and he swung his sword at the Green Wood Sword in a desperate attempt to force it back.</p><p>The key turned out to be in the belly!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up, and the spiritual power in his body circulated wildly. He was about to use all his strength to activate the ebony sword. He would break through the golden light blockade in one go and kill him.</p><p>At this moment, the aftermath of the sword formation burst out and scattered. Before the two sword qi dissipated, they touched the golden brick walls on both sides of the Yongdao...</p><p>For some reason, Qin Sang suddenly felt a little uneasy.</p><p>He looked sideways, and saw that when the sword qi hit the wall, the golden light on the golden brick wall seemed to turn into a living creature. It opened its mouth wide and swallowed the sword qi in one gulp.</p><p>After a burst of wriggling, two identical sword qi suddenly burst out of the golden light and went straight for Qin Sang, their speed a whole lot faster than previously!</p><p>Luckily, Qin Sang had been on alert, and his figure flashed continuously, dodging the sword qi attack. However, unexpectedly, the sword qi was like tarsal maggots and relentlessly pursued him.</p><p>The speed of the sword qi was too fast to dodge.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze darkened slightly, and his palm turned over. A black long sword appeared in his palm. It was the spiritual sword he had previously obtained from the black-cloaked old man. It was a superb spiritual weapon, and its power was naturally not weak.</p><p>'Hu!'</p><p>The long sword suddenly slashed out. The black sword shadow cut through like a crescent moon and clashed with the sword qi. Qin Sang's figure trembled violently, and he could not help but take a step back.</p><p>After the sword qi was swallowed by the restriction on the wall, its power also increased by a whole lot!</p><p>Finally eliminating the two sword qi, Qin Sang gently swung out another sword, stabbing it towards the wall, and as expected, he was immediately counterattacked. The move was exactly the same, but the power had doubled.</p><p>"As long as the restriction on the wall is triggered, there will be a counterattack?"</p><p>Qin Sang roughly understood the rules of the Yongdao. As long as he converged his spiritual power and did not touch the restriction, it would not be too difficult.</p><p>However, before he could relax for a moment, a piercing scream suddenly came from the depths of the Yongdao, and two dazzling golden lights shot over. There was actually a sharp arrow in the middle of the golden light!</p><p>Qin Sang reacted extremely quickly, and managed to knock the two sharp arrows away with great difficulty. His gaze darkened slightly as he looked towards the depths of the Yongdao, and could not help but gasp.</p><p>At this moment, the corpse puppet had been ordered by Qin Sang to stop, but the portrait in front was still disturbed. Two golden armored divine generals holding long bows had appeared. They raised their long bows high, and the golden arrows pointed towards Qin Sang from afar. Two more arrows were shot!</p><p>Further ahead, all the portraits began to show abnormal fluctuations. If he waited any longer, more and more golden armored divine generals would come down.</p><p>If he could not resolve the opponent quickly, he would inevitably be besieged. Coupled with the restrictions, his situation would be extremely dangerous!</p>
