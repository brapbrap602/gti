<h1>Chapter 471: Void Thunder</h1><p>After a period of intense fighting, an unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, a crisp 'crack' suddenly echoed, signifying that a Talisman Treasure had exhausted its power and been utterly destroyed.</p><p>And the first Talisman Treasure to be destroyed was the handsome young man's black hammer!</p><p>Qin Sang's blue mirror, though much dimmer than at the start, still held on.</p><p>The handsome young man was stunned. He never expected his Talisman Treasure to be the first to expire.  He had only used it twice, while Qin Sang's blue mirror had clearly seen much more use.</p><p>This unexpected turn of events nearly threw the young man off balance.  He hurriedly retrieved another talisman slip from his storage pouch.</p><p>The moment the black hammer was destroyed, Qin Sang's eyes lit up, knowing his opportunity had arrived.</p><p>Seeing the young man's frantic movements and realizing he was preparing another Talisman Treasure, a hint of disdain flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The battle was raging.  How could his opponent have time to prepare a Talisman Treasure while under constant pressure? Unless he had some special means to buy himself time…</p><p>The power of the blue mirror was clearly waning. As long as Qin Sang could hold his ground and use other magical tools to endure, once the blue mirror shattered, they would be back on equal footing.</p><p>The young man's cultivation level was not low, and he possessed numerous treasures, so it wouldn't be difficult for him to achieve this.  However, any cultivator who had spent a year training in the Chaotic Isles wouldn't make such a mistake.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, manipulating the blue mirror.  It traced a blue arc in the air, taking advantage of the young man's momentary lapse in concentration, and attacked with exceptional cunning.</p><p>Only then did the young man realize his folly. His expression panicked, he put away the talisman slip, retrieved a flying sword, and hastily launched it to counter the blue mirror.</p><p>This flying sword was peculiar. The front half of the blade split, forming two points like a fork. Qin Sang had witnessed its power before; it was no less potent than the Cold Gold Sword.</p><p>As the blue mirror was about to collide with the flying sword, instead of evading, it accelerated, its blue light blazing, as if intentionally seeking the collision.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The blue mirror shattered into pieces.</p><p>The flying sword was sent tumbling through the air. One of its forked tips had broken off, and a deep, alarming crack marred its blade.</p><p>At the moment of impact, Qin Sang had unleashed the remaining power of the blue mirror, aiming to use its last embers to destroy the young man's flying sword.</p><p>One was caught off guard; the other had planned this. The result did not disappoint Qin Sang.</p><p>The young man's face turned pale.</p><p>His divine sense was connected to the flying sword, and he inevitably suffered backlash from its damage.</p><p>The flying sword was clearly unusable. To make matters worse, the Cold Gold Sword arrived right after.</p><p>Qin Sang was obviously not satisfied with destroying just the flying sword and had already prepared a follow-up attack.</p><p>Fortunately, the young man wasn't completely foolish. Ignoring the fallen flying sword, he hurriedly took out a mirror similar in shape to the blue mirror and threw it out.</p><p>However, the moment the mirror was launched, a white light suddenly locked onto it.</p><p>Under the magnetic force of the Yin-Yang Compass, the mirror momentarily froze.  This brief pause prevented it from intercepting the Cold Gold Sword in time.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Sharp sword energy stung the young man's eyes, carrying the aura of death.</p><p>His face contorted in terror. With a yell, his protective robe shattered, releasing a white mist. In the nick of time, the mist shifted him a foot to the side, narrowly dodging the Cold Gold Sword's killing blow.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Cold Gold Sword grazed the young man's arm, leaving a deep gash.</p><p>He screamed, retreating rapidly, clutching his wound, and glaring at Qin Sang with intense hatred and lingering fear.</p><p>Another top-grade magical tool… you might as well be called the Treasure Master.  Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>He wasn't discouraged that the blow hadn't killed the young man.  Maintaining a calm demeanor, he recalled the Ebony Sword, pressing forward step by step, gradually reducing his opponent's room to maneuver.</p><p>One wrong step led to another.  Having lost the initiative, the young man could only dodge in a disheveled manner, finding it increasingly difficult. After evading another attack, he quickly shifted position, his back momentarily exposed to Qin Sang, and his eyes met Yu Shanting’s.</p><p>In that instant, their gazes locked.</p><p>The young man's eyes flickered. He lowered his head slightly, a fierce glint flashing in his eyes.  Seizing the moment before the Cold Gold Sword returned, he suddenly raised a new treasure saber in his hand, its blade brimming with sharp energy, and slashed at Qin Sang with all his might.</p><p>Simultaneously, his other hand swept across his waist, and a gray orb fell into his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the young man's strange actions and grew wary.  His gaze swept over him, quickly noticing the gray orb.</p><p>The orb was grayish-white, only the size of a dragon's eye, perfectly round and flawless.  Occasionally, a silvery-white light flashed across its surface, like a thin lightning bolt.</p><p>The orb rested quietly in the young man's palm, appearing dull and unassuming, lacking the overt power exuded by other magical tools.</p><p>But the moment Qin Sang saw the orb, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>This inconspicuous orb gave him an extremely terrifying feeling. He had only experienced this sensation a few times in his life, each time while teetering on the brink of death.</p><p>If the young man unleashed this orb, he might die!</p><p>This thought, unprovoked and deeply rooted, invaded Qin Sang's consciousness.</p><p>In that instant, every hair on his body stood on end.</p><p>His pupils constricted sharply as he stared at the gray orb in the young man's hand, his mind racing. What was this thing? He had never heard of it before.</p><p>He saw spiritual energy surge from the young man's palm and converge into the orb.  His eyes were filled with a crazed intensity, and a terrifying sneer twisted his lips.</p><p>“I absolutely cannot let him use it!”</p><p>Qin Sang screamed inwardly, disregarding everything else.  He made an instant decision and unhesitatingly activated the Ebony Sword.</p><p>All this happened in the blink of an eye.  Qin Sang never lacked decisiveness.</p><p>Just then, he heard Granny Jing's voice.</p><p>"Careful! It's Void Thunder!"</p><p>Void Thunder!</p><p>So that’s what it is!</p><p>Understanding dawned on Qin Sang.  No wonder! It was the Void Spirit Sect's Void Thunder!</p><p>Qin Sang had first learned of Void Thunder from Shopkeeper Wu and had heard rumors of it over the years, but he had never seen it, so he didn't recognize it.</p><p>Void Thunder was a single-use magical tool similar to the Profound Yin Thunder, but its power was countless times greater.  It was said to be capable of severely injuring even Gold Core cultivators, a truly terrifying weapon.</p><p>Void Thunder was the Void Spirit Sect's most treasured artifact.</p><p>It was rumored that even the Void Spirit Sect hadn't been able to refine true Void Thunder for a long time.</p><p>Some said the refining method had been lost, while others claimed that refining Void Thunder was incredibly difficult, and no one in the Void Spirit Sect was currently capable of it.</p><p>In any case, there had been no news of Void Thunder appearing in the Small Cold Realm for a long time, and even the Void Spirit Sect's own disciples rarely mentioned it.</p><p>Who would have thought that the handsome young man, hailing from the Yuan Mirage Sect, would possess a Void Thunder!</p>
