          <li class="calibre3">
            <a href="#calibre_link-341">With safety assured, Li Fan did his best to maintain the Innate Grandmaster Technique, simultaneously focusing his attention on the True Immortal blood that resembled a fiery wall. Under the impact of countless divine senses, its defenses seemed to show faint cracks. The stalemate continued for an unknown duration. Finally, Li Fan broke through the defenses of the True Immortal blood. The backlash vanished out of thin air, and his soul instantly felt clear and cool. A beam of light emerged from the True Immortal blood, enveloping Li Fan's divine sense. Afterward, a segment of light and shadow appeared before him. It was as if it were covered in mist, and all surrounding scenes were indistinct. An enraged voice was heard from a distant, towering figure. It was sporadic, and only the general meaning could be understood: "...Qionglang Star Domain... Yan... guarding..." "...Target found..." "Your subject obeys the order." A low voice emanated from his own body. The light and shadow shifted again. In the next moment, he was already within the Xuanhuang Realm. Standing high above, overlooking the myriad sentient beings within the realm. However, his body's attention seemed not to be on the Xuanhuang Realm below, but rather on the outside of the starry sky. He appeared to be waiting for something. After an unknown amount of time, a beam of light suddenly arrived from beyond the heavens. His gaze immediately locked onto it. But he did not interfere, allowing the beam of light to fall into the Xuanhuang Realm. Only when the light completely dimmed and settled did his figure descend to the mortal world to investigate specifically. "Not yet." "But it's not bad. If it were years ago, ascension would have been possible. What a pity..." The figure seemed accustomed to this outcome, shaking his head with neither joy nor sorrow, and then returned to the Xuanhuang Realm's celestial dome. Silently watching, waiting for the arrival of the next target... The scene abruptly froze, then rapidly faded and dissipated like a vintage photograph. Li Fan jolted back to reality, returning to the present. Although the memories experienced within the True Immortal blood were fleeting, Li Fan felt as if he had lived through dozens of lifetimes. This longevity was also reflected in his physical body. His long hair, which had been flowing freely, had now grown to his waist, interspersed with white strands. His face, palms, and even the skin all over his body had become somewhat wrinkled. Li Fan looked at his age on the Return to Reality panel. His mental age had not changed, but his physiological lifespan limit had been directly reduced to 50 years. He was still thirty years old in spirit, yet his life was nearing its end. "Is this the price of prying into True Immortals?" After attempting to use the Xuanhuang Realm's celestial treasures that increased lifespan and confirming they could not increase this reduced lifespan limit, Li Fan's heart filled with dread. "If it were an ordinary cultivator, they would surely be driven to a desperate situation by this." "Fortunately, I have [Return to Reality]. A 50-year lifespan limit makes little difference to me." "There are still 20 years left in this life, which is enough to complete my plans." Li Fan's mood calmed down, and he couldn't help but recall the scenes he had seen within the True Immortal blood earlier. "The True Immortal who owned this blood should have been ordered to come to Xuanhuang to find a certain target..." "The word 'subject' is quite interesting." "Moreover, that beam of light from beyond the heavens..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes. Combining the information from the ancient immortal formations in the Xuanhuang Realm and the clues obtained from outside the high wall, a guess emerged in Li Fan's mind: "The ancient Xuanhuang Realm was also 'capturing' things." "Unlike the later capture of other cultivation worlds, the target at that time was... 'Humans'?" Li Fan's eyes flickered. "But it's not bad. If it were years ago, ascension would have been possible..." Li Fan repeated the True Immortal's words several times. "The 'light from beyond the heavens' that had the 'potential for ascension' was not the target that True Immortal was waiting for. What exactly is it..." Suddenly, Li Fan, for some unknown reason, began to associate himself with it. Although the True Immortal's memories were vague and from countless years ago, Li Fan inexplicably felt a sense of having narrowly escaped a catastrophe. When he came to his senses, his back was already drenched in cold sweat. This was not due to Li Fan's timidity, but rather a primal fear and relief after realizing the situation in hindsight. "This..." His rapidly beating heart slowly calmed down. Li Fan temporarily left the underground space of the Dao Discussion Platform and flickered back to the sky above the Great Profound Minor World. Boundless clouds obscured the sight of the living beings on the ground. Li Fan savored the premonition he had just experienced. "Although it's hard to believe..." "But a premonition from the depths of my being tells me that years ago, the True Immortal's target in Xuanhuang might actually have been me?!" "Or rather, not me, but [Return to Reality]!" Li Fan closed his eyes, preventing his inner turmoil and shock from being exposed. "[Return to Reality], [Return to Reality]..." As he spoke, the surrounding scenery became illusory and ethereal again. Being isolated from the real world gave Li Fan a slight sense of peace. "[Return to Reality] involves the Great Dao of [True and False] and [Illusion and Reality]." "Wondrous artifacts of heaven and earth, True Immortal script characters, and even the mysterious symbol that created the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate's bloodline, are all partial projections of the Great Dao." "But only [Return to Reality] stands above all else." "It can be said to be almost the embodiment of the Great Dao of [True and False] and [Illusion and Reality] itself..." Li Fan's thoughts churned as he calmly contemplated. "The fact that the True Immortal called himself 'subject' suggests that the towering figure in the memory must have an extraordinary status." "Qionglang Star Domain... Yan..." Li Fan attempted to deduce the possible truth of the matter from the fragmented information. "It appears the Immortal Realm was already facing a crisis at that time." "Yan..." "With the power of a True Immortal, perhaps they could deduce a solution to the Immortal Realm's crisis, which was [Return to Reality]." "That's why they were 'lying in wait' in the Xuanhuang Realm?" "However, for some reason, I arrived here tens of thousands of years too late." ... After breaking free from the True Immortal's memories for a long time, the lingering sense of narrowly escaping death in Li Fan's heart eventually dissipated. With his emotions calmed, Li Fan re-examined his earlier speculation and found it almost absurdly laughable. "What is the truth?" Li Fan, his mood having calmed, flickered from the sky back to the underground. He looked at the remaining True Immortal blood in the golden net, pondering for a long time. "I cannot pry into it further in this life." "I will see in the next life if I can find more clues." "Even if my guess is confirmed, it doesn't matter. After all, the Immortal Realm faced a great calamity, and those True Immortals who wanted to 'hunt' me have already disappeared first!" A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and his state of mind became steady once more. Although he could not further pry into the memories from the True Immortal blood in this life, it did not prevent Li Fan from continuing his research on the True Immortal flesh. "Next, let me see how the True Immortal flesh resists the power of True Immortal script characters." With his Origin Force Essence surgical knife, he cut off a small piece of flesh. Then, golden light continuously rotated, transforming into a grinder, crushing this small piece of flesh.Chapter 1324</a>

<h1 id="calibre_link-262" class="calibre1">Chapter 1251: The Holy Emperor Crosses the Tribulation</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the pond did not appear extraordinary, the Stone Tablet's intuition told it that some secret was hidden here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet slowly walked to the edge of the pond. The clear water reflected the scholar's appearance, causing him to pause slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he shook his head, and his appearance instantly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am somewhat curious, what were you originally like?" the Faceless Saint Emperor Li Ping said from behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heh heh, I can barely remember myself," the Stone Tablet chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, it seriously observed the pond.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The water was not deep, and one could see the bottom at a glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet observed for a long time but found no mystery in the pond, and couldn't help but doubt its own judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It turned to look at Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping did not explain, but suddenly asked meaningfully, "Before the great calamity of the Xuanhuang Realm, there were many Immortal Treasures in existence. Now, after more than ten thousand years have passed, these treasures have long since disappeared without a trace. The existence of Immortal Artifacts has become a legend, and even cultivators rarely mention them in casual conversation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Does Fellow Daoist know the whereabouts of these Immortal Treasures?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet's expression remained unchanged. "Immortal Artifacts? I've never cared about them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Halfway through his sentence, he seemed to realize something and looked back at the Fishing Pond again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After pondering for a moment, his appearance changed again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet, now in the form of an old fisherman wearing a straw cloak and carrying a fishing basket, threw out his fishing rod.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next moment, his body suddenly froze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without reeling in the line, the Stone Tablet stood motionless, as if frozen in ice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long time, it took a step back, disengaging from the illusion before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What was that?" The Stone Tablet stared directly at Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is what?" The Saint Emperor asked knowingly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fishing pond? The starry sky?" the Stone Tablet pressed on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping shook his head slightly. "That is the [Bait]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The angler is also being fished." Li Ping's tone was cold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if Fellow Daoist saw all the treasures in the starry sky, you wouldn't be moved. But if it involves your path to liberation? Can you still remain so calm?" Li Ping's voice was low and melodious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet had existed in the Xuanhuang Realm for too long and had witnessed too many events.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, after hearing Li Ping's words and pondering for a moment, it quickly understood his meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The path to immortality is broken, and the Sea of Stars beyond Xuanhuang should have long been a ruin. Unless..." A glimmer of understanding flashed in the Stone Tablet's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What, you want to go out and explore?" Li Ping asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet denied it. "All things in the world are similar. Even if it's another world, what difference does it make? I just want to take off this heavy stone on my back and sleep soundly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its topic returned to the Fishing Pond. "I don't know when this thing arrived in the Xuanhuang Realm. But I can be sure it was after the great calamity."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"More accurately, it was after the Law Transmitter reappeared and established the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor was more direct. "That is to say, this Fishing Pond was likely implanted in the Xuanhuang Realm along with fragments of other cultivation worlds."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It should be so... but Immortal treasures surpass our understanding. We cannot guarantee this." The Stone Tablet reserved its judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The liberation you mentioned, is it not for me to bite this bait?" The Stone Tablet looked at the Saint Emperor with a strange expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping said frankly, "Exactly. Fellow Daoist, aren't you living in great pain? You are one with the Creation Stone Tablet. I believe that in the entire world, only an Immortal Treasure that surpasses the power limit of the Xuanhuang Realm can separate you from the Stone Tablet."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for what happens after being fished by the power behind the Fishing Pond, that is beyond my guarantee."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet really wanted to say, "We have no enmity, Fellow Daoist, why would you harm me?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the words stopped on his lips.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was clear that this Faceless Venerate had no ill intentions. Otherwise, why would he reveal the entire plan?</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, the Stone Tablet felt this person was quite honest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, a familiar aura emanating from the other party inexplicably gave him a sense of peace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am just tired of living and want to get rid of this burden. It doesn't mean I don't want to live anymore." The Stone Tablet politely declined the Saint Emperor's offer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If Fellow Daoist is just troubled by the constant information emerging from the Creation Stone Tablet, then the matter is easily resolved." Li Ping finally revealed his true intention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh?" The Stone Tablet's eyes clearly showed suspicion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Does Fellow Daoist recognize this object?" Li Ping reached out, and a brilliant blue crystal floated quietly in his palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am aware of the Dao-Transformation Stone. Do you intend to..." The Stone Tablet shook its head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To tell you the truth, to alleviate the pain, I have tried various methods. I have even tried the Taiyan Sect's Dao-Transformation Divine Secret technique. However, the Creation Stone Tablet is the embodiment of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's authority. The Heavenly Dao is lofty and looks down upon all things. After merging with me, it can no longer tolerate other things..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That was before. Things are different now." Li Ping directly interrupted the Stone Tablet's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet paused slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Besides, I can also help you."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As these words were spoken, the aura emanating from the Faceless Saint Emperor changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sky above the Taoist temple gathered clouds, and a peculiar rhythm appeared out of thin air, echoing the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The familiar and close feeling in the Stone Tablet's heart became even more evident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You are?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it had lived for tens of thousands of years, it couldn't help but exclaim in shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it quickly dismissed the thought. "No, this is impossible. And..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet looked up at the sky, its expression shifting from shock to solemnity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The authority wielded by the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate was independent of the Creation Stone Tablet, yet it was above the Stone Tablet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although its deeds were recorded, they were only brief mentions. Only the vaguest outlines existed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the Stone Tablet, sensing the aura emanating from the Faceless Saint Emperor at this moment, was clearly different from the recorded Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate controls the钧天 Dao. Although there are subtle connections with the Heavenly Dao, it is more like a separate entity. However, after receiving some kind of empowerment, it can manipulate the laws of the Heavenly Dao as if it were its own arm. As for the one before me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A thought inexplicably arose in the Stone Tablet's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Incarnation of the Heavenly Dao?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although somewhat unbelievable, this was the most reasonable explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping also seemed to sense the Stone Tablet's thoughts and no longer displayed his connection with the Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nor did he directly explain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, he continued the previous topic. "With the Dao-Transformation Stone to help you alleviate and sort out the events happening in the Xuanhuang Realm, it should make things easier for you."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But relying solely on the Dao-Transformation Stone is not enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet's eyes narrowed slightly, waiting for the other party's next words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Dao-Transcendence Sect, Fellow Daoist should be familiar with it." Li Ping asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing these three words, the Stone Tablet's expression turned slightly displeased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The True Sight Divine Eye of the Dao-Transcendence Sect has a similar effect to the Creation Stone Tablet. Combined with the endless paper figures, that Book of Dao-Transcendence can also record everything it monitors."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Book of Dao-Transcendence, combined with the Dao-Transformation Stone, should be sufficient to offset the side effects of the Creation Stone Tablet. As for the rest, I believe your tenacious will, cultivated over tens of thousands of years, should be able to handle it." The Faceless Saint Emperor spoke slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet fell silent, pondering the feasibility of the other party's suggestion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"First, the quality of the Dao-Transformation Stone in your hand is somewhat insufficient..." After a moment, the Stone Tablet spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's fine, I can find a better one," the Saint Emperor replied directly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet paused, then continued, "Second, the Dao-Transcendence Sect angered the Law Transmitter back then, and the entire sect was sealed away and disappeared. Due to their cultivation technique [Eternal Tribulation World], they can even interfere with Heaven and Earth's perception. Moreover, it was the Law Transmitter who acted, so..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I know where they are hiding," the Saint Emperor said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet was astonished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems this person is even stronger than I imagined."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the other party had said so much, the Stone Tablet naturally would not continue to stall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Please lend me your assistance, Fellow Daoist." It spoke sincerely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping was waiting for this sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Follow me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">His figure flickered, and he instantly appeared at the edge of the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet followed suit, its figure moving swiftly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only Ou Shangtian was left behind, looking bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had not heard the conversation between the Saint Emperor and the Stone Tablet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since Li Ping pointed towards the Fishing Pond, Ou Shangtian had lost the ability to perceive these two powerful beings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only when they left one after the other did he react.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Didn't Master want to deal with that Stone Tablet? Why aren't they fighting?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it be that, like the Earth Vein Ancient Tree, he's also joining our Sacred Dynasty?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian immediately had a bad premonition.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Ping and the Stone Tablet had already arrived outside the Dao-Transcendence Sect's sealing location.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching Li Ping skillfully break the Law Transmitter's seal, the doubts in the Stone Tablet's heart grew.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is a seal left by the Law Transmitter. Even a Heavenly Dao incarnation cannot break it so easily?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Or perhaps, after so many years, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao has recovered enough strength to contend with the Law Transmitter?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping ignored the Stone Tablet's thoughts and led it all the way into the Dao-Transcendence Sect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Up the mountain, down the mountain, endless repeating courtyards...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything transformed rapidly before his eyes, and finally, the main hall of the Dao-Transcendence Sect appeared before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Enter."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet followed him inside and confirmed that this was indeed the former location of the Dao-Transcendence Sect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It could sense that countless lifelike and deathlike paper figures were hidden within this gloomy main hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They were one of the Ten Immortal Sects of the Xuanhuang Realm, enjoying the cultivation resources generated by the Xuanhuang Realm. Yet, when disaster struck, they chose to hide and escape. They are truly like those so-called Seers of the Worlds, parasites of the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Ping's words were cold and merciless, criticizing them without reservation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet squinted its eyes, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Eternal Tribulation World, cultivating through the calamities of the world. This is inherently a wicked technique that harms Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth were flourishing and free from calamities, perhaps these people would stir up trouble and create calamities. Such a sect should have been exterminated long ago." Li Ping continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if hearing the Saint Emperor's words, a cold wind inexplicably blew through the gloomy hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thinking they could escape everything by transforming into paper figures..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A golden chain emerged from the Saint Emperor's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Silently, it shot into the depths of the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if stirring up mist, the darkness within the Dao-Transcendence Sect's main hall fluctuated like water waves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet observed the golden chain, a flicker of surprise in its eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, a phantom image of a golden vortex slowly formed within Li Ping's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thousands of golden chains, following the rotation of the vortex, whistled out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bang, bang...</p>
<p class="calibre2">They flew into the darkness, as if colliding with something, emitting muffled sounds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's imposing aura was too overwhelming. Even the Stone Tablet had to take a step back temporarily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet couldn't help but secretly marvel, "This person's strength is indeed much greater than ordinary [Longevity Realm] cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems to be more than just the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sound of creaking could be heard continuously in the hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the golden vortex nebula within the Saint Emperor rotated in reverse, and the golden chains retracted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something in the darkness seemed to be bound by the chains and was being forcibly dragged out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If ordinary cultivators saw this scene, they would surely feel a chill run down their spines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Stone Tablet felt a rare flicker of excitement in its heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When a paper figure with a somewhat terrified expression emerged from the darkness, the Stone Tablet's eyebrows couldn't help but rise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was these bastards!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The paper</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-263" class="calibre1">Chapter 1252: The Truth of Transmission</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping’s golden chain moved slightly, and one of the paper figures was pulled in front of him. Unlike the others, this paper figure showed little fear. Instead, it looked listless and weak. Its thick, bushy eyebrows were furrowed, giving it a somewhat comical appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Desire for survival?" Li Ping said coldly. "If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach? If the Xuanhuang Realm is destroyed, where will you live!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The thick-browed paper figure offered a wry smile. "Our sect, the Crossing Calamity Sect, has only ordinary strength. If the Xuanhuang Realm is truly destroyed, what can we do? We can only accept our fate. Are you going to blame the mortals of this world for not stepping forward to save the Xuanhuang Realm? One can only do what they are capable of..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping did not debate with the paper figure of the Crossing Calamity Sect. The golden chain tightened slightly. "Sharp-tongued, unrepentant even when facing death."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Golden light slowly condensed, shrinking from the thickness of a chain to that of a fine thread. It wound around the thick-browed paper figure, circle by circle. The other captured paper figures cried out in terror. However, the thick-browed paper figure, as if sitting in solemn meditation, became serious. He began to chant, "Time turns to dust, calamity is eternal. A hundred generations and a thousand tribulations, melt my golden body..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden Origin Force, which had always been effective for the Saint Emperor, lost its efficacy for the first time. Li Ping felt the power he exerted on the thick-browed paper figure being cleverly nullified by an unseen force. It was even absorbed, becoming part of its foundation. The golden threads slowly dissolved, yet the thick-browed paper figure remained unmoving. The color of the paper figure, from aged white-yellow, slowly transformed into a brilliant gold, approaching the essence of Origin Force.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet, which had been observing, suddenly became grave. "Fellow Daoist, be careful. This is the Crossing Calamity Sect's ultimate technique, [Eternal Tribulation World], which can transform all calamitous powers in the world into sustenance for one's cultivation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping sneered. "Just a turtle hiding its head. You wish to use my power to cultivate? Very well, I shall oblige!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Blinding golden light, like raging flames, erupted from the Saint Emperor. The surging flames illuminated the entire space of the Crossing Calamity Sect in a golden hue. The condensed golden flames flowed through the remaining chains, being channeled into the paper figure's golden body. The numerous other paper figures, not the primary targets but merely caught in the crossfire, let out earth-shattering wails, as if being scorched by fierce fire. It was evident how immense the pressure on the golden-bodied paper figure was; it appeared distorted, as if on the verge of melting. Yet, the thick-browed paper figure remained unmoving, its expression serene.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This scene caused the Stone Tablet to secretly gasp. Even though they could not discern their original appearances after transforming into paper figures, for someone to remain so calm and unharmed under the Saint Emperor's might was rare, even within the fully empowered Crossing Calamity Sect of the past. The Stone Tablet tried to guess the identity of the thick-browed paper figure.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the Faceless Saint Emperor did not cease tormenting the paper figures of the Crossing Calamity Sect. The golden flames burned ever brighter. Although they did not completely incinerate the paper figures, they slowly coated them with an indelible golden layer. Especially the thick-browed paper figure, enveloped by the flames, its golden light becoming even more conspicuous.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You wish to avoid the world and hide from disaster, but I will not allow it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Realm faces peril, and you all bear responsibility!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's voice boomed like thunder. Origin Force essence erupted outwards, illuminating every corner of the space. Its brilliance was such that even the Stone Tablet had to close its eyes to avoid it. When the light receded, the darkness within the main hall of the Crossing Calamity Sect had vanished. The uncomfortable, oppressive aura was also gone. The paper figures, freed from the chains, tumbled to the ground in disarray. Compared to before, they seemed to possess a little more vitality. The leading thick-browed paper figure had transformed into a "little golden man."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden man still had the same listless, dispirited appearance. He sighed, "Your Excellency wasted so much Origin Force essence on us useless individuals; it truly is a waste of heavenly treasures!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It’s too cost-ineffective!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping said sternly, "If all matters in the world were decided by pure rationality, the Xuanhuang Realm would have perished long ago! How else would you be able to spout nonsense here!" Before his words finished, a large "X" appeared on the golden paper figure's face, sealing its mouth. Following that, the other paper figures were similarly affected. The hall of the Crossing Calamity Sect, which had been chaotic like a marketplace, instantly fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist Yijue?" At this moment, the Stone Tablet looked at the golden paper figure and asked tentatively. The paper figure, unable to speak, merely winked at the Stone Tablet. Whether it was an acknowledgment or a denial was unclear.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no time for pleasantries. The space here was no longer stable after losing the support of Origin Force essence. "Let's get out first." Li Ping, along with the Stone Tablet and the dazed paper figures, vanished from the spot. The ancient immortal sect, suppressed by the Grand Law Seal, finally revealed its true form.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A book, unfolding from the center. The book contained no words, only relief carvings of mountains and empty architectural scenes. As the book naturally turned, the images within changed. However, they were all in silhouette, appearing comical and bizarre. Li Ping grasped the Book of Crossing Calamity with his giant hand, and the mountains and rivers depicted within were instantly stained with gold.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Collect!" the Saint Emperor commanded, and the densely packed paper figures, including the thick-browed little golden man, flew uncontrollably into the Book of Crossing Calamity. *Bang!* Li Ping pressed his right hand down, closing the book. All anomalies vanished instantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This place is not suitable for lingering. Although my method of deciphering the Grand Law Seal was ingenious, and I restored the seal as I deciphered it, I cannot guarantee that abnormalities here will not be discovered by the Grand Law."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Follow me." Li Ping said sternly, his figure already vanishing from this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet followed the Saint Emperor, traversing space through the Xuanhuang Realm's spatial channels, and arrived in an endless void. At their speed, they had been flying for quite some time in the void before sensing the presence of a world ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That is..." The Stone Tablet was slightly startled. "The Five Elements Cave-Heaven of the First Origin Sect? It's here. Doesn't that mean the Longevity Realm cultivator from the previous Brilliant Circulation Cave-Heaven..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While the Stone Tablet was pondering, Bai Hua had already flown to greet them. After her gaze lingered on the Stone Tablet for a moment, Bai Hua then transmitted something to Li Ping via voice transmission. Li Ping nodded slightly. Then, Bai Hua nodded to the Stone Tablet before flying back into the Five Elements Cave-Heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is where I recuperate. Fellow Daoist, what do you think of this place compared to the Xuanhuang Realm itself?" Li Ping brought the Stone Tablet to the Great Qi small world. A scan of Li Ping’s divine sense revealed the general state of the small world. Although some areas were obscured by mysterious forces, preventing complete omniscience, what was revealed was enough to shock the Stone Tablet. Even though the Creation Stone Tablet's reputation for recording all matters in the world was somewhat undeserved now, it still knew the events that had transpired in the Xuanhuang Realm's various prefectures. However, compared to this Great Qi small world... it was like being centuries behind, an entire era. The intricacies of it were beyond even the Stone Tablet's comprehension. Furthermore, it sensed the aura of an old acquaintance here. For instance, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree, and that disciple of the Beast Taming Sect.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Following Li Ping to the Saint Emperor's Throne, the Stone Tablet's shock slowly subsided. "I have carried this stone tablet for so many years, thinking I knew all about the world. I never imagined that the events unfolding today would reveal truths that have long surpassed my predictions..." The Stone Tablet spoke with a sense of loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, there is no need to be discouraged. Progress and change are the righteous paths. If the world stagnates for thousands of years..." Li Ping smiled slightly. "Wouldn't that make us seem incompetent?" The Stone Tablet was speechless, unsure how to respond. Its interactions with this "Heavenly Dao incarnation" had been too shocking. Compared to the scenes it was witnessing now, the Xuanhuang Realm in its mind felt like merely a stage play, a fabricated illusion. This made the Stone Tablet feel somewhat lost and disheartened.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I knew long ago that the Five Elders Council, the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and even the other supreme experts in the Xuanhuang Realm, if they knew about the stone tablet on my back, they would try to evade the stone tablet's records. But I never expected that the truth of the world would have evolved to this extent..." Li Ping vaguely sensed the Stone Tablet's thoughts and spoke slowly, "The Xuanhuang Realm is the last refuge of the ultimate starry sea. The Xuanhuang Realm itself, fragments of other worlds, survivors of the starry sea, and powers from beyond the High Wall... all converge here. Its complexity is such that not only you, Fellow Daoist, but even the Grand Law Transmitter and the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao itself cannot fully grasp it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes..." The Stone Tablet sighed and nodded. It then thought of the Fishing Pond it had seen earlier. How many such hidden treasures were there in the Xuanhuang Realm? As an ancient remnant of the Xuanhuang Realm, it now truly felt a sense of being out of sync with the times. "Things change, stories are no longer the same." Long ago, scenes from the early Xuanhuang Realm surfaced in the Stone Tablet's mind, causing it to pause slightly. It was Li Ping's voice that broke the silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fusion of realms is inevitable. Between myself and the Grand Law Transmitter, a battle is bound to occur. However, regardless of who wins or loses, it will not change the fact that the Xuanhuang Realm will be reborn from its decay." Li Ping did not mention helping the Stone Tablet resolve its overload of mental information, but suddenly spoke. The Stone Tablet's thoughts converged, and it focused on Li Ping. "The crux of the matter lies in the new orthodoxy of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, do you know the secrets of the Grand Law Transmitter?" Li Ping’s divine sense locked onto the Stone Tablet, asking in a deep voice. The Stone Tablet pondered for a moment and replied, "When the Grand Law Transmitter first appeared, we of the Ten Immortal Sects investigated. He was indeed a native cultivator of the Xuanhuang Realm. His life trajectory from childhood was completely clear and recorded."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Grand Law Transmitter’s name is Xuanyuan Zituo. He lived in a rural village and was frail as a child, so his parents gave him the humble name 'Dog Egg'. Until the age of fifty, his life was no different from an ordinary farmer. It was only after the age of fifty-one that he suddenly attained enlightenment and rose to prominence."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is why, in the initial investigations by the Ten Immortal Sects, they could find no trace of his origins, as he truly achieved enlightenment suddenly." The Stone Tablet slowly recounted. As it spoke, scenes from that year appeared in the Saint Emperor's Throne room.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanyuan Zituo." Li Ping looked at the screen, observing the somewhat simple and honest young boy, who gradually transformed into a taciturn middle-aged farmer, and then into a white-haired elder. "It is indeed possible for a mortal to attain enlightenment suddenly. However, this usually happens at a young age. Xuanyuan Zituo's evolution, reaching this stage, only occurs when he is near his end..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is truly perplexing and suspicious." Li Ping commented. The Stone Tablet nodded. "The Ten Sects harbored similar suspicions back then. However, we used secret arts and the Heavenly Dao's validation to confirm that there was no possession or impersonation by an outsider in him."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But the Grand Law Transmitter is truly mysterious. He seems to possess innate knowledge. Even when several Longevity Realm cultivators from the Ten Sects attacked him back then, he managed to resolve it through some unknown method. Since then, he has completely surpassed our control. Perhaps if the Ten Sects had launched a full-scale attack back then, the outcome might have been different..." The Stone Tablet sighed with emotion. The great hall fell silent. After a long while, Li Ping suddenly spoke, "Heavenly Dao validation... What if the method of impersonation surpasses the Heavenly Dao itself?" The Stone Tablet was utterly stunned. At first glance, Li Ping's words seemed like sophistry. But after careful consideration, the Stone Tablet realized that the Ten Sects' overconfidence in their methods back then had led to their unshakable belief for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's too late to inquire about the Grand Law Transmitter's secrets now. What use is it?" After a brief moment of disappointment, the Stone Tablet felt a new thought arise in its heart. With a sense of confusion, it looked back at the Saint Emperor. The Saint Emperor's voice echoed like thunder in the great hall. "As I said before, the key to the rebirth of the Xuanhuang Realm lies in the word 'orthodoxy'."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's like a new body assembled from severed limbs; who serves as the brain is crucial."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Currently, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao still considers itself the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. But perhaps not for much longer..." Li Ping's tone was melancholy. The Stone Tablet knew that as a Heavenly Dao incarnation, Li Ping would not speak without reason, and its expression changed. "Fellow Daoist, please elaborate."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The matters recorded on your stone tablet, you can observe them all from your position as an outsider. However, with the fusion of realms, memories become like personal experiences, blurring the lines between reality and illusion. Over time, one can no longer distinguish between falsity and truth, between the self and the external."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Especially..." Li Ping's gaze turned towards the Xuanhuang Realm, thousands of miles away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao is weak now, its resistance is minimal. If one day, the remaining wills of the Heavenly Daos from various realms descend like a flood, rushing in simultaneously..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I fear the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao would immediately be unable to bear it, going mad and losing its sense of self." Li Ping's tone carried a hint of self-mockery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that point, if someone were to guide and erode it with a relatively complete Heavenly Dao will, they could steal the heavens and change the orthodoxy of Xuanhuang. By then, although it would still be called the Xuanhuang Realm, it would no longer be the original Xuanhuang, from the inside out." The Stone Tablet fell into deep contemplation upon hearing this. The target of the Saint Emperor's words was clearly the Grand Law Transmitter.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-264" class="calibre1">Chapter 1253: Clear Guanshi Divine Eye</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Rectifying principles, rectifying principles..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it truly be like this?" Yin Shangren stood stunned for a long time before his body began to tremble uncontrollably. Xu Ke's aged face also showed excitement. "No wonder Mr. Bai always said all I needed was to wait."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Besides the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao descending to save itself, countless mortals are also constantly embarking on the path of cultivation. The process of cultivation is the process of reversing the principles of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma. After thousands of years, the accumulation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Faceless Saint Emperor's voice was ethereal. "It's not that the process of dispelling the Immortal-Mortal Miasma is simple in the eyes of cultivators. The initial steps and prerequisites for cultivation are essentially the same as the ultimate goal of achieving Longevity."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is also defying the principles of Heaven and Earth." Upon hearing this, complex emotions flickered in Yin Shangren and Xu Ke's eyes. Yin Shangren said, "If the Heavenly Venerate of Reversal were still alive, it would not be so easy for mortals in the Xuanhuang Realm to defy the principles of Heaven and Earth and embark on the path of cultivation. But precisely because Mr. Bai has passed away, the restrictions of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma have been greatly weakened."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping interjected at this point, "Moreover, Eastern Pole Heavenly Venerate foresaw the mysteries of this place. Using the Net Body Spiritual Pool formation, he further reduced the difficulty of defying the principles." Xu Ke's lips moved, and after a long struggle, he managed to speak, "The last time I saw Mr. Bai, I saw the death wish in his heart. I haven't been able to let go of it all these years, but now, perhaps I understand a little."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren fell into mumbling again, "Everyone is defying the principles of Heaven and Earth, but in essence, this is still within the cultivation system created by the Law Transmitter. Even if we know this, what use is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There must be something we haven't thought of..." Li Ping spoke with certainty. "The answer should lie within the Immortal-Mortal Miasma. When it comes to researching the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, perhaps no one in the Xuanhuang Realm currently knows more than you. I'm afraid it will be a bit more strenuous for you."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although there are no longer any mortals carrying the Immortal-Mortal Miasma within the Great Qi, it is not difficult to find some from the conquered small worlds for research. I will have people fully cooperate with you," Li Ping said to Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Emperor, please rest assured," Yin Shangren suddenly became excited.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile. In the Derivation Law Jade space within the Myriad Immortals Alliance. After the Saint Embryo encountered the Remnant Realm Great Wall, Li Ping's original calm heart was once again stirred. "Defying the principles of Heaven and Earth again? Immortal-Mortal Miasma..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping suddenly recalled his experience of dispelling the Immortal-Mortal Miasma in the Pure Body Spiritual Pool formation on Glazed Island back then. The lava-like hot pool water ravaged his consciousness. Even with a firm will, he eventually fell into a state of ignorance and oblivion. His mind became blank, acting solely on instinct. Before entering the Spiritual Pool, Li Ping, who had been cultivating the Xuanhuang Pure Heart Curse day and night, instinctively reactivated the technique. While completely dispelling the miasma within his body, Li Ping inexplicably comprehended an advanced and elevated version of the Xuanhuang Pure Heart Curse. The Xuanhuang Heart Refining Curse. And then it evolved into the current Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Curse. This technique had been of immense help to Li Ping throughout his journey.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The suffering in the Pure Body Spiritual Pool is unbearable for ordinary people. Most would fall into a coma, and even if they remained conscious, they would be unable to accommodate any other distracting thoughts amidst such extreme pain."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Embrace the Dao, cleanse the mind, emulate nature..." His eyes closed tightly, but a flash of inspiration crossed Li Ping's mind. "Humans merge with the Dao. Instinctive actions in a state of ignorance and oblivion are precisely the closest to the Dao. This might be why so many mortals in the world can successfully dispel the Immortal-Mortal Miasma and defy the principles of Heaven and Earth again."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, this is not defying the principles in the true sense. The fact that their strength did not leap significantly after dispelling the Immortal-Mortal Miasma proves this point." Li Ping pondered and contemplated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Firstly, it's because the Immortal-Mortal Miasma was not dispelled entirely by their own power. Secondly..." The Dao-Transformation Stone flashed in his mind, and Li Ping recalled the moment of enlightenment, savoring it repeatedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the Immortal-Mortal Miasma was finally dispelled..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It was as if it disappeared on its own."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just like sensing my cultivation of the Xuanhuang Pure Heart Curse, it spontaneously transformed into the Heart Refining Curse."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Did it trigger some condition?" Li Ping recalled the scene of Eastern Pole's life before his death, transmitted by the True Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The secret of defying Heaven and Earth again lies hidden within the Immortal-Mortal Miasma." In Li Ping's eyes, he saw countless mortals over thousands of years breaking the shackles between immortals and mortals, and embarking on the path of cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The birth of every cultivator is a process close to defying the principles of Heaven and Earth again."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if they are unaware of it, this is a true occurrence."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To defy Heaven and Earth again is tantamount to directly confronting the Law Transmitter and completely overturning the cultivation system he personally created. Figures like Mr. Bai and Eastern Pole, who were Heavenly Prodigies, also ended in failure. This shows the immense difficulty. But..." Li Ping suddenly realized. He recalled the simulation process of his own repeated reincarnations.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The process of every mortal resisting the Immortal-Mortal Miasma can be seen as a simulation of defying the principles of Heaven and Earth again."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The strength of one person may have limits. The strength of tens of thousands of people also has its limits."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But tens of thousands of people, stretching over countless years, create infinite power."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Facing such immense power, the new method created by the Law Transmitter is bound to be broken, it's only a matter of time." Li Ping's mind trembled. "All beings in all worlds, the masses refining spirits, use pure numbers to shake the power of the transcendent Immortal."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Endless beings, defying the laws forever, this magnifies the advantage of numbers over time, achieving a qualitative leap from quantitative change..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As long as there are individuals in the Xuanhuang Realm who refuse to accept their mortal fate, this method will continue indefinitely." Li Ping's thoughts raced, and he felt even more genuine respect for Mr. Bai, who created such a marvelous method. Ignoring the limit of lifespan, his methods still took effect after his death, spanning across time and influencing events many years later. Unlike Li Ping, who possessed the True Return Treasure, this was the limit that ordinary mortal cultivators could possibly achieve. Of course, this was of little use to Li Ping personally. However, this did not prevent Li Ping from harvesting Mr. Bai's achievements.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In my opinion, the secret of defying the principles of Heaven and Earth again, hidden within the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, is the enlightenment gained by countless cultivators while dispelling the Immortal-Mortal Miasma over the years."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"All of it has been recorded and preserved."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If one could absorb these simulated experiences of defying Heaven and Earth again and again..." Li Ping considered himself capable of remaining indifferent to most treasures in the Xuanhuang Realm now, even Cat Treasure from beyond the High Wall. However, he had to admit that he was deeply moved upon sensing these countless experiences of defying principles. Unlike magical artifacts, this 'gift package' was something that could directly enhance Li Ping's soul essence. It was enough to significantly shorten the gap between him and the Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician. Although it was a one-time benefit, it was of great significance to Li Ping, and the sooner he discovered it, the better.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It could at least save me three lifetimes of reincarnation time." Li Ping calculated in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then, where did Mr. Bai hide this grand gift package?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is it within the Immortal Mirror, or within the power of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma? Does it require any special conditions to be triggered?" If it weren't for the fact that he had already decided on the strategy of 'watching the tigers fight' in this life, Li Ping would have been desperate to go in person and investigate. However, years of experience had allowed him to suppress this impulse.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With Yin Shangren and Xu Ke working hard together to research it, it will be more efficient than me fumbling around blindly."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If they find out, it's equivalent to me finding out. Anyway, it will all be mine in the end, no need to rush."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can also see how much weight this gift package holds. After the Saint Emperor's clone absorbs it, can he really shake the Law Transmitter?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hehehe, it really makes me look forward to it." After being confined in the Derivation Law Jade space for a long time, Li Ping, who felt bored, was now full of emotion.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-265" class="calibre1">Chapter 1254: Rift Hides Dark Power</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Sun Erlang's words, the white-haired Taoist priest smiled slightly. "Indeed, everyone has their own independent personality and thoughts. It is indeed difficult to get everyone to work together wholeheartedly. The events that have occurred in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm indicate this." The white-haired Taoist priest waved his whisk lightly, and countless images instantly appeared in the pure white space before Sun Erlang. Black shadows representing the end times hovered over the Xuanhuang Realm, potentially descending at any moment. However, regarding how to deal with this catastrophe, various sects and factions in the Xuanhuang Realm still held different attitudes. There were those who resolved to abandon the realm and flee, those who chose to be cowardly turtles, those who worked tirelessly to rally everyone to unite, and those who took advantage of the chaos to satisfy their selfish desires. The beings in the image had no specific appearances, all replaced by faceless little figures. But the absurd farces being played out were incredibly real.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But this is the past Xuanhuang Realm." The white-haired Taoist priest waved his whisk again, and the scene changed dramatically. "United as one, firm will against fate, openly joining divine power, carefree therefore fearless, one word decides everything..." As the True Heavenly Venerate spoke, the living scenes from the human territories of the Five Elders Council appeared before Sun Erlang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What do you think of this place compared to the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" the True Heavenly Venerate asked. "It is indeed much better than the Myriad Immortals Alliance," Sun Erlang said without hesitation. He then added, "Unfortunately, all of this is based on the great divine powers of the five Heavenly Venerates. Everything is as ephemeral as a mirage. If one day, one of these Heavenly Venerates encounters misfortune, this seemingly beautiful scene will instantly collapse."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the territory of the Five Elders Council, openly discussing the potential demise of a Heavenly Venerate was an act tantamount to treason. However, the white-haired Taoist priest before him did not show any anger. Instead, he nodded in agreement, "You are indeed somewhat correct, but also entirely incorrect." Sun Erlang's expression faltered, and he cupped his hands solemnly, "Please enlighten me, Heavenly Venerate."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The reason you are correct is from the perspective of an outsider cultivator; it is indeed so. The order here is all born from the five Heavenly Venerates. If the Heavenly Venerates were to perish, the order would also vanish."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The reason you are incorrect is because you do not understand the true meaning of the Longevity Realm." The True Heavenly Venerate stroked his beard and spoke slowly, "To defy the principles of Heaven and Earth, and thus achieve longevity."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After cultivators defy the principles, they naturally become a part of the world's principles. Just like sunlight, water droplets, and air, they all constitute the [World] itself."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Humans are not isolated individuals. Discussing cultivators in the Longevity Realm without negating the existence of the Longevity Realm is also meaningless." Sun Erlang did not fully understand the True Heavenly Venerate's words. In his opinion, this was more like a form of sophistry. However, the Longevity Heavenly Venerate, standing at the pinnacle of this realm, would not engage in petty arguments with a junior like him. Sun Erlang frowned and pondered carefully. After a long while, he said thoughtfully, "We are discussing cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm. This is the fundamental premise. And the Longevity Heavenly Venerates have already become an inseparable part of the Xuanhuang Realm, so..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No," Sun Erlang suddenly became vigilant. "The key is that your power does not seem to cover the entire Xuanhuang Realm? It is only confined to this area." The True Heavenly Venerate asked, "Have you perceived the existence of Carefree Heavenly Venerate's divine power?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang nodded, "Of course, I am aware of it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As fellow cultivators in the Longevity Realm, Carefree's strength is not much stronger than ours. What he can do..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We can naturally also do it," the True Heavenly Venerate said slowly. Upon hearing this, Sun Erlang felt an instinctive disbelief. Then, as he pondered, his expression gradually became solemn. "Then why?" he couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Naturally, the time is not yet right." The white-haired Taoist gently waved his whisk. The white space of the True Fruit Tree gradually faded. The figure of the True Heavenly Venerate also slowly became blurred.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heavenly Venerate!" Only then did Sun Erlang suddenly remember his Master's instructions and quickly shouted, "Does Heavenly Venerate know about Eastern Pole Heavenly Venerate?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You will see." The white space exploded violently. Countless rays of light erupted simultaneously, blooming in Sun Erlang's mind. He returned to the real world, but Sun Erlang was still immersed in the images transmitted by the True Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Defying the principles of Heaven and Earth again? Are you crazy? You've already reached this point, just one step away from defying the principles. If you follow the normal progression, you'll achieve Longevity. Why do this?" The young Taoist's expression was full of confusion, his words intense.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Longevity? That's merely becoming one with the Dao." The figure opposite him was indistinct, but his tone showed disdain for the [Longevity Realm]. He continued, "If that existence were not present, it would be fine for us to become one with the Dao. But the entire cultivation system is built upon the framework created by him..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xinghan, do you know the consequences?" The young Taoist remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Realm is being destroyed and reborn. This is the only thing he cares about right now. Someone achieving Longevity is insignificant to him. In fact, he would even welcome the birth of a Longevity Realm cultivator that meets his expectations. Do you know why?" The young Taoist continued to lower his head, silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your talents are no less than mine, so how can you not understand? It's just that you're clinging to a sliver of hope."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let me be blunt. One day, when the Xuanhuang Realm welcomes rebirth and completes its transformation, the so-called Longevity Heavenly Venerates will completely become a part of the new world's Heavenly Dao... It's better to live than to die, or rather, it doesn't matter whether you live or die."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"They are all just tools for transforming the world." The indistinct figure sneered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is just your fantasy, your conjecture..." After a long time, the young Taoist weakly retorted. But the indistinct figure ignored him and continued, "I refuse to believe it! I must fight against him!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To defy the principles of Heaven and Earth and achieve longevity. This is the foundation of his enlightenment, but also his greatest flaw. If one can defy his principles again, one can instantly steal all his creation and replace him..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Eastern Pole! You..." The young Taoist nervously looked around, fearing that these heaven-defying words would be overheard by others. The indistinct figure, full of ambition and confidence, said, "Xinghan, don't be nervous. I am not alone on this path." Just then, Eastern Pole spoke comfortingly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, there lies the secret of defying Heaven and Earth again. It originates from the previous Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate who has already passed away..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'm starting to get a clue recently. As long as..." Boom! Eastern Pole hadn't finished speaking when the image suddenly shattered. When his vision cleared again, it was still Eastern Pole's figure. However... Eastern Pole, who was originally full of pride and arrogance, looked extremely strange. His head was bowed, his body naked. His long hair was scattered, and countless silk threads extended from his body. Extending into the endless void beyond.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Eastern Pole!" This horrifying scene, along with the True Heavenly Venerate's exclamation, suddenly vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is this?" Sun Erlang's mind was shaken. Although it was only a brief conversation, the secrets revealed were all earth-shattering. Sun Erlang first looked around and realized that not much time had passed since he entered the creation illusion of the True Fruit. Currently, there were still cultivators meditating under the fruit, undergoing the test. But Sun Erlang had no intention of staying here any longer. He had to return quickly and tell Master everything he had seen and heard. Fortunately, the attention of the cultivators in the city was focused on the [Heavenly Prodigies] who were still in the illusion. There wasn't much attention paid to Sun Erlang, the failed participant. He quietly left the city and headed straight for the entrance of the Great Qi small world. While flying, Sun Erlang's thoughts raced.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The True Heavenly Venerate had discovered my whereabouts long ago?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Which is why he appeared in the illusion to meet me."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"They already knew about Eastern Pole Heavenly Venerate's situation, and coincidentally, I was sent by Master to come here, so they used me to relay these images to Master..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What deeper meaning lies behind this?" Even though Sun Erlang considered himself experienced, facing the truth about the Xuanhuang Realm's ultimate secrets, he still found it difficult to control himself. Sun Erlang couldn't help but speed up his pace.</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Earth Vein Ancient Tree was also within the Faceless Saint Emperor's Origin Force essence net. Therefore, after Ruo Mu surrendered, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree vaguely sensed it. However, it could not confirm, and its fear and unease only grew daily. "Now we are all subordinates of the Saint Emperor. With the Saint Emperor's protection, how could he possibly do anything to me?" the Ancient Tree could only console itself. The Earth Vein Ancient Tree knew very well that perhaps only the Saint Emperor could save its life. And the more useful it was to the Sacred Dynasty, the safer it would be. Thus, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree eagerly wanted to prove its worth to the Saint Emperor. Unfortunately, ever since arriving at the Sacred Dynasty of Great Qi, it felt as if it had been forgotten. No one actively sought it out. Even the task entrusted to it earlier, to sort out the Earth Veins of Great Qi's small world, had not been inspected. This made the Earth Vein Ancient Tree quite dejected.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, one day, the opportunity the Ancient Tree had been waiting for finally arrived. It was Ou Shangtian, the fifth disciple of the Saint Emperor. "This is the diagram of the Xuanhuang Realm's Earth Vein currents?" Ou Shangtian pointed at the image before him and asked. A dense, intricate network, extending to all corners of the Xuanhuang Realm. Like blood vessels in a human body, they seemed to contract and pulse, looking quite bizarre. The Earth Vein Ancient Tree nodded, "Young Master, you see correctly."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian seemed quite pleased with the Ancient Tree's flattery and readily accepted the title of "Young Master." "I heard from Senior Sister Lin Ling that when traveling through the Earth Vein currents, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's power naturally conceals them, making it difficult for ordinary people to detect. Is that true?" Ou Shangtian asked again. "Indeed." The Earth Vein Ancient Tree handed over a withered branch. "Young Master, please take a look."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian felt the Earth Vein current power surging within the withered branch and frowned slightly. "I don't see anything particularly special about this. How can it shield others' perception?" The Earth Vein Ancient Tree smiled slightly, "Young Master, you must understand that gathering sands can form a high tower, and dripping water can form a river. A single point of Earth Vein power may seem insignificant. But when the Earth Vein currents of the entire Xuanhuang Realm converge, it becomes truly vast and majestic, like the might of thunder."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ultimately, the flow of Earth Veins is an important part of the normal operation of the Xuanhuang Realm. I am merely holding its reins on its behalf. Compared to the overwhelming principles of the entire Xuanhuang Realm, ordinary cultivators are naturally overlooked." Ou Shangtian gazed blankly at the Earth Vein current diagram, lost in thought. After a long while, he came back to his senses, returned the Earth Vein withered branch, and instructed, "Coincidentally, I am going out on a mission assigned by Master this time, and I might need your help."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Earth Vein Ancient Tree had been waiting for this. Upon hearing this, it was overjoyed. "Young Master, please command me. I will definitely assist you with all my heart." "In the Xuanhuang Realm, there is an immensely powerful senior, carrying a stone tablet on his back... Do you know of him?" Ou Shangtian asked, looking at the Earth Vein Ancient Tree. The Earth Vein Ancient Tree's expression suddenly changed. The previous eagerness instantly vanished. It stared at Ou Shangtian in disbelief for a long time before tentatively asking, "Young Master, is the Sacred Dynasty planning to take action against Senior Stone Tablet?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I may be so bold, that Stone Tablet is a true Longevity Realm cultivator, and has been enlightened for many years..." Ou Shangtian impatiently waved his hand. "I naturally know the strength of that so-called Stone Tablet. Longevity Realm, indeed!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Compared to Master, it's nothing!" "Don't worry, I am only responsible for luring him to a specific location." Upon hearing Ou Shangtian's words, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree was slightly relieved. Since the mysterious Faceless Saint Emperor could subdue its father, it should be able to deal with this Stone Tablet without issues. The Ancient Tree became invigorated. "Young Master, how may I cooperate?" Ou Shangtian explained the detailed plan. The Ancient Tree pondered and nodded, indicating that it was not a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's no time to delay. After I meet Master, I will set off immediately." The Ancient Tree stated, "My main body is still in the Xuanhuang Realm. As long as Young Master summons me, I can appear at any time." Ou Shangtian hurried into the Saint Emperor's Throne. When he emerged, the anxiety on his face had completely disappeared. "I have the Kunqian Bone Hand, and the Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light protects my body. I have even received a treasure bestowed by Master this time. And I have studied formations for so long..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I only need to lure him to the Fishing Pond, and the mission will be complete. It should not be a problem." "But isn't the Fishing Pond our Sacred Dynasty's treasure? Why would Master ask me to lure the great enemy there? Isn't he afraid of any unexpected accidents?" Ou Shangtian couldn't understand no matter how hard he thought. However, in the end, he couldn't be bothered to think about it anymore. He left the Great Qi small world and headed straight for the Nine Mountains Prefecture of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Relying on the surging Earth Vein currents, it only took the time to brew a cup of tea to reach the Nine Mountains Prefecture. Ou Shangtian tried it out. As expected, the spatial laws here were somewhat chaotic and fragile. If he rashly used the teleportation technique, he might directly tear the space and be sucked into the spatial turbulence, never to be found again. "However, flight is not a problem. These nine mountain peaks can stump ordinary cultivators, but not me with the Seven-Colored Divine Light."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking this, Ou Shangtian deliberately controlled the Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light to form a protective layer around his body. Like a blazing sun in the sky, it constantly emitted its own rhythm outwards. With a thought, an armor that also emitted a seven-colored glow suddenly appeared on Ou Shangtian's body. Master's words echoed in Ou Shangtian's ears at the same time: "This item is called [Flowing Light Armor], refined from the Nine Heavens Thunderclap and the Morning Breath Rainbow Neon. After wearing it, your flight speed can rival that of lightning, and it can ignore most types of attacks..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian tried it out. Looking at the summit of the mountain range far ahead, in just a moment's daze, he found himself on the mountaintop the next instant. "So fast!?" Ou Shangtian himself was shocked. With the dual enhancement of the Flowing Light Armor and the Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light, his speed had reached an unimaginable level. Even though he was flying ostentatiously, emitting seven-colored light all over his body, due to his extreme speed, not a single cultivator in the entire Nine Mountains Prefecture could detect him. Even the Harmonious Dao guardians of the Myriad Immortals Alliance were the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian was cautious at first, but eventually, upon confirming that no one could perceive him, he gradually relaxed. He even felt a sense of exhilaration, as if he could do whatever he pleased. "This is exhilarating, truly exhilarating!" In the vast Nine Mountains Prefecture, he had flown back and forth several times in the time it took to draw a breath. The feeling of lightning speed made Ou Shangtian somewhat intoxicated. At the same time, he couldn't help but feel confused. "Just by flying around like this, can I lure out that Stone Tablet?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is it that mystical? I'm flying so fast, maybe he won't be able to find me?" "Should I slow down and try?" Just as Ou Shangtian's thoughts began to wander, a sense of inexplicable crisis suddenly arose in his heart. A scene suddenly appeared in his mind. The heavens and earth suddenly darkened. It felt like an invisible restraint; no matter how he flew, he couldn't escape the scope of the darkness. In despair, his body slowly slid towards the center of the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"!" Ou Shangtian's heart trembled violently. He knew that this was the self-warning of his other companion artifact, apart from the Kunqian Bone Hand: the Myriad Death Records. "What the hell is that? The Stone Tablet?" The scene he foresaw made Ou Shangtian's hair stand on end. He made a decisive move and detonated a formation crown he had prepared for a long time. Instantly, countless formations were completed, protecting Ou Shangtian in the center. Only then did the illusionary scene from the Myriad Death Records slowly dissipate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Ou Shangtian's sense of crisis did not diminish. As the formation setter, he could clearly feel that the tens of thousands of formations he had painstakingly laid out were disappearing at an unbelievable speed. But from beginning to end, he never saw the person breaking the formation. It was as if something was silently devouring them. The horror in his heart intensified. Taking advantage of the protective formations still being effective, Ou Shangtian threw out several more formation crowns around him. Layer after layer of formations unfolded, and a shadowy figure slowly materialized. However, Ou Shangtian did not dare to look further.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Earth Veins!" He inwardly shouted, and Ou Shangtian plunged straight into the ground, heading towards the Earth Veins. In an instant, he disappeared. The myriad formations he left behind were bizarrely compressed into solid entities resembling book pages, all slowly floating towards the figure that had suddenly appeared. The figure gradually revealed its true appearance: a scholar, with a conspicuous stone tablet behind his back. Every time he received a page, after reading it. The page disappeared from his hand, flickered with fluorescent light, and then seemed to be branded onto the stone tablet.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scholar did not rush to pursue the escaping Ou Shangtian, but slowly finished reading all the pages in his hand. His originally calm expression gradually furrowed. "When did formations in the Xuanhuang Realm develop to this level?" "That 'light of the world'..." "Could it be an outsider?" All the pages in his hand disappeared. The scholar glanced in the direction of Ou Shangtian's location, sensing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Such speed. He even has the Earth Vein Ancient Tree to help..." The scholar sorted through the recent records on the stone tablet. He did not find any relevant entries. "More and more outsider prefectures are appearing, and even this so-called omniscient stone tablet is gradually becoming unworthy of its name." "Carefree, you were right. There is no such thing as eternal. Immortals are like this, and so is the power we Longevity Realm cultivators are proud of." Although this matter clearly smelled of conspiracy, clearly intended to lure him out. But the stone tablet felt no fear. Instead, there was more curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With one step, the next moment it had already arrived at the location where Ou Shangtian had been before. However, Ou Shangtian seemed to have anticipated this and had already preemptively burrowed into the Earth Veins. The torrent of Earth Veins roared and surged, making it difficult even for the Stone Tablet to find the trace of an ant. However, the Stone Tablet was not in a hurry, knowing that the opponent would inevitably reappear. Thus, it simply stopped in place and waited.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Interesting. It seems the person behind this understands me quite well." Instead of being angered by being toyed with, the Stone Tablet revealed a faint smile. And so, the Stone Tablet was gradually drawn to a peaceful mountain Taoist temple. Ou Shangtian no longer fled, but respectfully stood behind a majestic figure. The Stone Tablet's gaze shifted from Ou Shangtian to this figure. After observing for a moment, the smile on the Stone Tablet's face finally disappeared. It was replaced by a look of confusion and solemnity. The person before him felt somewhat familiar, yet also gave off a warning sense of danger.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just standing there, aren't you tired? Come in and sit down." Just as the two faced off, Li Ping spoke proactively. With just these few words, he broke the tense atmosphere of mutual confrontation. It didn't seem like enemies meeting, but rather like old friends meeting after a long separation, greeting each other familiarly. The Stone Tablet felt a strange sensation in its heart. However, it still said lightly, "Alright." It followed Li Ping into the Taoist temple below. Passing through the Taoist temple, Li Ping did not stop but continued to a pond behind the temple.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, how long have you been carrying that stone tablet on your back?" Li Ping asked. The Stone Tablet paused slightly, then answered without hiding anything, "Thirty-six thousand, nine hundred and forty-two years." "Thirty-six thousand, nine hundred and forty-two years." Li Ping repeated the number. "It sounds like a very long time, but it's only over thirty thousand years. Compared to the lifespan of the Xuanhuang Realm, it's insignificant. Let alone the Sea of Stars beyond the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Ping sighed slightly. The Stone Tablet also agreed, "Yes, thirty thousand years have passed in an instant. For Heaven and Earth itself, it may be nothing. But for an ordinary person like me, it's truly been too long."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ordinary person..." Ou Shangtian couldn't help but mutter softly at this moment. Li Ping smiled, "Shangtian, don't be disrespectful. Senior is right; he is indeed just an ordinary person." Ou Shangtian dared not disobey the Saint Emperor and quickly bowed to the Stone Tablet to apologize. The Stone Tablet, however, did not dwell on it and stared directly at Li Ping. "You... seem to know me very well?" Li Ping did not admit it, "It's just that I feel a sense of empathy." "I am also just an ordinary person, merely bearing a destined mission." Ou Shangtian lowered his head further, fearing that the slightest anomaly might be revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet, however, pondered, constantly observing Li Ping. His tall figure was unlike ordinary cultivators. The several mysterious energies attached to his body made the Stone Tablet dare not underestimate him. "Fellow Daoist, you led me here for what purpose? Could it be just to have a simple chat?" Finally, the Stone Tablet asked, ending the exchange of veiled words between them. "I am here to help Fellow Daoist attain liberation." Li Ping said, his voice solemn. These straightforward words made Ou Shangtian raise his head, a flicker of excitement in his eyes. The Stone Tablet narrowed its eyes, becoming wary.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems Fellow Daoist has misunderstood me. I truly wish to help Fellow Daoist attain liberation." Li Ping's tone revealed a hint of disappointment. The Faceless Saint Emperor gestured towards the surroundings. "Could it be that Fellow Daoist hasn't noticed anything amiss here?" Hearing this, the Stone Tablet's attention shifted from the Faceless Saint Emperor to its surroundings. Scanning the area, its gaze finally fell upon the calm pond.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-267" class="calibre1">Chapter 1256: The News of the Sky Sword Appears</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The pond did not appear extraordinary, but the Stone Tablet's intuition told it that some secret was hidden there.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet slowly walked to the edge of the pond. The clear water reflected the scholar's appearance, causing him to pause slightly. Then, he shook his head, and his appearance instantly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am somewhat curious, what were you originally like?" the Faceless Saint Emperor Li Ping said from behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heh heh, I can barely remember myself," the Stone Tablet chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, it seriously observed the pond. The water was not deep, and one could see the bottom at a glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?" The Stone Tablet observed for a long time but found no mystery in the pond, and couldn't help but doubt its own judgment. It turned to look at Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping did not explain, but suddenly asked meaningfully, "Before the great calamity of the Xuanhuang Realm, there were many Immortal Treasures in existence. Now, after more than ten thousand years have passed, these treasures have long since disappeared without a trace. The existence of Immortal Artifacts has become a legend, and even cultivators rarely mention them in casual conversation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Does Fellow Daoist know the whereabouts of these Immortal Treasures?" The Stone Tablet's expression remained unchanged.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal Artifacts? I've never cared about them..." Halfway through his sentence, he seemed to realize something and looked back at the Fishing Pond again. After pondering for a moment, his appearance changed again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet, now in the form of an old fisherman wearing a straw cloak and carrying a fishing basket, threw out his fishing rod. The next moment, his body suddenly froze. Without reeling in the line, the Stone Tablet stood motionless, as if frozen in ice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long time, it took a step back, disengaging from the illusion before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What was that?" The Stone Tablet stared directly at Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is what?" The Saint Emperor asked knowingly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fishing pond? The starry sky?" the Stone Tablet pressed on.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping shook his head slightly. "That is the [Bait]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The angler is also being fished." Li Ping's tone was cold.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if Fellow Daoist saw all the treasures in the starry sky, you wouldn't be moved. But if it involves your path to liberation? Can you still remain so calm?" Li Ping's voice was low and melodious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet had existed in the Xuanhuang Realm for too long and had witnessed too many events. Therefore, after hearing Li Ping's words and pondering for a moment, it quickly understood his meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The path to immortality is broken, and the Sea of Stars beyond Xuanhuang should have long been a ruin. Unless..." A glimmer of understanding flashed in the Stone Tablet's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What, you want to go out and explore?" Li Ping asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet denied it. "All things in the world are similar. Even if it's another world, what difference does it make? I just want to take off this heavy stone on my back and sleep soundly."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Its topic returned to the Fishing Pond. "I don't know when this thing arrived in the Xuanhuang Realm. But I can be sure it was after the great calamity."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"More accurately, it was after the Law Transmitter reappeared and established the Myriad Immortals Alliance." The Saint Emperor was more direct.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That is to say, this Fishing Pond was likely implanted in the Xuanhuang Realm along with fragments of other cultivation worlds."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It should be so... but Immortal treasures surpass our understanding. We cannot guarantee this." The Stone Tablet reserved its judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The liberation you mentioned, is it not for me to bite this bait?" The Stone Tablet looked at the Saint Emperor with a strange expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping said frankly, "Exactly. Fellow Daoist, aren't you living in great pain? You are one with the Creation Stone Tablet. I believe that in the entire world, only an Immortal Treasure that surpasses the power limit of the Xuanhuang Realm can separate you from the Stone Tablet."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for what happens after being fished by the power behind the Fishing Pond, that is beyond my guarantee."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet really wanted to say, "We have no enmity, Fellow Daoist, why would you harm me?" However, the words stopped on his lips. It was clear that this Faceless Venerate had no ill intentions. Otherwise, why would he reveal the entire plan?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, the Stone Tablet felt this person was quite honest. Moreover, a familiar aura emanating from the other party inexplicably gave him a sense of peace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am just tired of living and want to get rid of this burden. It doesn't mean I don't want to live anymore." The Stone Tablet politely declined the Saint Emperor's offer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If Fellow Daoist is just troubled by the constant information emerging from the Creation Stone Tablet, then the matter is easily resolved." Li Ping finally revealed his true intention.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh?" The Stone Tablet's eyes clearly showed suspicion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Does Fellow Daoist recognize this object?" Li Ping reached out, and a brilliant blue crystal floated quietly in his palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am aware of the Dao-Transformation Stone. Do you intend to..." The Stone Tablet shook its head.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To tell you the truth, to alleviate the pain, I have tried various methods. I have even tried the Taiyan Sect's Dao-Transformation Divine Secret technique. However, the Creation Stone Tablet is the embodiment of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's authority. The Heavenly Dao is lofty and looks down upon all things. After merging with me, it can no longer tolerate other things..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That was before. Things are different now." Li Ping directly interrupted the Stone Tablet's words. The Stone Tablet paused slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Besides, I can also help you." As these words were spoken, the aura emanating from the Faceless Saint Emperor changed. The sky above the Taoist temple gathered clouds, and a peculiar rhythm appeared out of thin air, echoing the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The familiar and close feeling in the Stone Tablet's heart became even more evident.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You are?!" Even though it had lived for tens of thousands of years, it couldn't help but exclaim in shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it quickly dismissed the thought. "No, this is impossible. And..." The Stone Tablet looked up at the sky, its expression shifting from shock to solemnity. The authority wielded by the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate was independent of the Creation Stone Tablet, yet it was above the Stone Tablet.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although its deeds were recorded, they were only brief mentions. Only the vaguest outlines existed. But the Stone Tablet, sensing the aura emanating from the Faceless Saint Emperor at this moment, was clearly different from the recorded Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate controls the Jun Tian Dao. Although there are subtle connections with the Heavenly Dao, it is more like a separate entity. However, after receiving some kind of empowerment, it can manipulate the laws of the Heavenly Dao as if it were its own arm. As for the one before me..." A thought inexplicably arose in the Stone Tablet's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Incarnation of the Heavenly Dao?" Although somewhat unbelievable, this was the most reasonable explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping also seemed to sense the Stone Tablet's thoughts and no longer displayed his connection with the Heavenly Dao. Nor did he directly explain. Instead, he continued the previous topic. "With the Dao-Transformation Stone to help you alleviate and sort out the events happening in the Xuanhuang Realm, it should make things easier for you."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But relying solely on the Dao-Transformation Stone is not enough." The Stone Tablet's eyes narrowed slightly, waiting for the other party's next words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Dao-Transcendence Sect, Fellow Daoist should be familiar with it." Li Ping asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing these three words, the Stone Tablet's expression turned slightly displeased. "The True Sight Divine Eye of the Dao-Transcendence Sect has a similar effect to the Creation Stone Tablet. Combined with the endless paper figures, that Book of Dao-Transcendence can also record everything it monitors."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Book of Dao-Transcendence, combined with the Dao-Transformation Stone, should be sufficient to offset the side effects of the Creation Stone Tablet. As for the rest, I believe your tenacious will, cultivated over tens of thousands of years, should be able to handle it." The Faceless Saint Emperor spoke slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet fell silent, pondering the feasibility of the other party's suggestion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"First, the quality of the Dao-Transformation Stone in your hand is somewhat insufficient..." After a moment, the Stone Tablet spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's fine, I can find a better one," the Saint Emperor replied directly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet paused, then continued, "Second, the Dao-Transcendence Sect angered the Law Transmitter back then, and the entire sect was sealed away and disappeared. Due to their cultivation technique [Eternal Tribulation World], they can even interfere with Heaven and Earth's perception. Moreover, it was the Law Transmitter who acted, so..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I know where they are hiding," the Saint Emperor said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet was astonished. "It seems this person is even stronger than I imagined."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the other party had said so much, the Stone Tablet naturally would not continue to stall. "Please lend me your assistance, Fellow Daoist." It spoke sincerely.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping was waiting for this sentence. "Follow me." His figure flickered, and he instantly appeared at the edge of the sky. The Stone Tablet followed suit, its figure moving swiftly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only Ou Shangtian was left behind, looking bewildered. He had not heard the conversation between the Saint Emperor and the Stone Tablet. Ever since Li Ping pointed towards the Fishing Pond, Ou Shangtian had lost the ability to perceive these two powerful beings. Only when they left one after the other did he react.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Didn't Master want to deal with that Stone Tablet? Why aren't they fighting?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it be that, like the Earth Vein Ancient Tree, he's also joining our Sacred Dynasty?" Ou Shangtian immediately had a bad premonition.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Ping and the Stone Tablet had already arrived outside the Dao-Transcendence Sect's sealing location. Watching Li Ping skillfully break the Law Transmitter's seal, the doubts in the Stone Tablet's heart grew.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is a seal left by the Law Transmitter. Even a Heavenly Dao incarnation cannot break it so easily?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Or perhaps, after so many years, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao has recovered enough strength to contend with the Law Transmitter?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping ignored the Stone Tablet's thoughts and led it all the way into the Dao-Transcendence Sect. Up the mountain, down the mountain, endless repeating courtyards... Everything transformed rapidly before his eyes, and finally, the main hall of the Dao-Transcendence Sect appeared before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Enter." The Stone Tablet followed him inside and confirmed that this was indeed the former location of the Dao-Transcendence Sect. It could sense that countless lifelike and deathlike paper figures were hidden within this gloomy main hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"They were one of the Ten Immortal Sects of the Xuanhuang Realm, enjoying the cultivation resources generated by the Xuanhuang Realm. Yet, when disaster struck, they chose to hide and escape. They are truly like those so-called Seers of the Worlds, parasites of the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Ping's words were cold and merciless, criticizing them without reservation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet squinted its eyes, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Eternal Tribulation World, cultivating through the calamities of the world. This is inherently a wicked technique that harms Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth were flourishing and free from calamities, perhaps these people would stir up trouble and create calamities. Such a sect should have been exterminated long ago." Li Ping continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As if hearing the Saint Emperor's words, a cold wind inexplicably blew through the gloomy hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thinking they could escape everything by transforming into paper figures..." A golden chain emerged from the Saint Emperor's body. Silently, it shot into the depths of the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As if stirring up mist, the darkness within the Dao-Transcendence Sect's main hall fluctuated like water waves. The Stone Tablet observed the golden chain, a flicker of surprise in its eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, a phantom image of a golden vortex slowly formed within Li Ping's body. Thousands of golden chains, following the rotation of the vortex, whistled out. Bang, bang... They flew into the darkness, as if colliding with something, emitting muffled sounds.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's imposing aura was too overwhelming. Even the Stone Tablet had to take a step back temporarily. The Stone Tablet couldn't help but secretly marvel, "This person's strength is indeed much greater than ordinary [Longevity Realm] cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems to be more than just the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The sound of creaking could be heard continuously in the hall. As the golden vortex nebula within the Saint Emperor rotated in reverse, and the golden chains retracted. Something in the darkness seemed to be bound by the chains and was being forcibly dragged out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If ordinary cultivators saw this scene, they would surely feel a chill run down their spines. However, the Stone Tablet felt a rare flicker of excitement in its heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When a paper figure with a somewhat terrified expression emerged from the darkness, the Stone Tablet's eyebrows couldn't help but rise. It was these bastards! The paper figures.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-268" class="calibre1">Chapter 1257: Stone Mother Returns Beyond the Stars</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's intention was clear. With the Sacred Dynasty on the verge of war with the Myriad Immortals Alliance, it was time for the Taiyan Sect to make its final choice. When Sun Erlang found Yi Shu in Saint Capital City, Yi Shu was already prepared, waiting with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Young Master, shall we go?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang, without any pretense, cupped his hands, and the two headed straight for the Taiyan Sect.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, during your stay in our Sacred Dynasty, did you have any unique gains?" Sun Erlang asked tentatively on the journey back.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Shu smiled, "The scenes of the Sacred Dynasty are different from the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and even more so from the Xuanhuang Realm's countless millennia. We have benefited immensely. Currently, the sect has reached a consensus and has also received acknowledgement from the Stone Mother. You will know when the time comes."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, perhaps this time you will have the opportunity to meet the Stone Mother."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Shu's words stirred Sun Erlang's heart. When he tried to probe for more insider information, Yi Shu changed the subject, chatting about his recent experiences in Great Qi.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The people of the Sacred Dynasty have abundant food and clothing, thus they have a higher pursuit of spiritual matters. Although their cultivation and strength are ordinary, certain ideas are truly interesting. This time, I befriended a scholar who wrote a collection of strange tales. It describes what would happen in the Xuanhuang Realm without the existence of Celestial Venerables who transmit laws…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang was slightly taken aback, and then heard Yi Shu continue, "Unlike the simulated worlds you've experienced, in that novel, although the transmission of laws is not evident, calamities still befall and plague the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Three Venerables rise from humble beginnings, gaining widespread influence and standing as rivals. One, through enlightenment and nurturing the populace, becomes the [Teacher of Heaven and Earth]. One, with the pure and noble virtues of a sage, wins the hearts of those around him, forming an unshakeable alliance. This is the [Supreme Sage of the Mortal Realm]. One, with boundless might, establishes an earthly immortal dynasty. Wherever his forces point, all things submit. This is the [Grand Mystic Immortal Emperor]…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Shu paused here, and Sun Erlang's expression became very subtle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The three Venerables clash fiercely, battling for hundreds of years without a clear victor. The details of this conflict, deduced by personal strength, though somewhat crude and requiring refinement, are still very interesting and novel…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang couldn't help but ask, "In the end, who won?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This 'Romance of the Xuanhuang's Three Parts' had not yet been completed when that scholar's doorstep was mobbed. Everyone claimed he was deeply disrespectful to the Saint Emperor and intended to teach him a lesson. Although the Sacred Dynasty's officials did not intervene, as the 'Grand Mystic Immortal Emperor' in the 'Romance' made some errors, the turmoil only escalated, almost resulting in a fatality."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That scholar dared not continue writing. The plot stagnated, and I don't know who the final victor is," Yi Shu said with a half-smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang coughed lightly, "After I return, I will deal with those people and let him write with peace of mind. It's just a collection of strange tales, after all. Master wouldn't possibly find it intolerable!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Shu hinted, "Although the Saint Emperor indeed wouldn't care, the people of the Sacred Dynasty might not necessarily think so."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang was about to argue, but they had already arrived within the Taiyan Sect's territory.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the floating city inside the celestial crystal wall, Sun Erlang stepped in again. Unlike last time, the cultivators he encountered on the way all greeted him with beaming smiles. It was as if they were all very familiar with him. Sun Erlang naturally knew that the Taiyan Sect's information was shared, essentially making them a single entity. However, this feeling of the other party knowing him, while he didn't know their backgrounds, still made Sun Erlang feel a bit awkward.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, the journey was not long, and soon Sun Erlang reached the Taiyan Sect's central hub and met Chen Tianhai. Chen Tianhai was holding a scroll and reading it intently. Yi Shu did not enter.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Greetings, Senior." Sun Erlang bowed. Chen Tianhai remained unmoved, seemingly not having heard him. After a long silence, Chen Tianhai finally spoke, getting straight to the point, "With the impending war between the Sacred Dynasty and the Myriad Immortals Alliance, our Taiyan Sect has decided…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To neither side."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This answer was truly beyond Sun Erlang's expectations, leaving him stunned on the spot. Wouldn't even a token show of support be appropriate? Being a fence-sitter, watching the tigers fight, might ensure temporary peace, but after everything settled, they would surely face severe repercussions. Logically, the Taiyan Sect shouldn't make such an unwise decision. Sun Erlang looked at Chen Tianhai, full of confusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We made this decision, not only after the Stone Mother's countless deductions yielded nearly identical winning outcomes…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But more importantly, because we've decided to temporarily leave the Xuanhuang Realm!" Chen Tianhai said, his words earth-shattering.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What?!" Sun Erlang was utterly stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is it because of the 'Empyrean Rainbow Light' that's causing such a stir recently?" Sun Erlang asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes and no. In fact, our Taiyan Sect had long intended to venture into the starry sky. It's just that the sea of stars is perilous, and it was always put on indefinite hold. However, that sword message from across the sea of stars changed our minds," Chen Tianhai said with a slight smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The sword message illuminated the Xuanhuang sky for seven days. During that time, we conducted a thorough analysis and achieved some minor gains. Since the sword message could traverse the sea of stars, our Taiyan Sect can trace its origin and follow its path back to find the sender," Chen Tianhai said with full confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Beyond the sea of stars, beneath the High Wall, it truly is a place to yearn for," Chen Tianhai sighed. Sun Erlang also seemed to feel the same will resonating throughout the Taiyan Sect. Knowing that this matter could no longer be stopped, Sun Erlang's thoughts raced, wanting to return quickly and inform his Master.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Young Master, there's no need to rush. After this parting, we don't know when we'll meet again. Why not have a meeting with the Stone Mother?" Chen Tianhai looked at Sun Erlang and suggested. Sun Erlang hesitated for a moment, then finally nodded. The moment he agreed, the surrounding room vanished, as if they were suddenly in the vast, dark expanse of the sea of stars. Only a brilliant blue light, originating from the depths of the darkness, shot out like a thin line, speeding through the starry sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon seeing this blue line, Sun Erlang instantly understood. This was the Dao-Transformation Stone Mother. The original Dao-Transformation Stone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I was not originally from the Xuanhuang. However, by chance, while traversing the sea of stars, I arrived in this realm." A voice appeared in Sun Erlang's mind. Communication was not through the five senses or divine sense, but directly through the resonance between the Dao-Transformation Stone crystals in Sun Erlang's sea of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang's expression became solemn, showing his respect. The Stone Mother continued her narration regardless, "Where I came from is now irretrievable. However, where I am going, there is an answer."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Mother's words sent shockwaves through Sun Erlang. "Where you are going? What do you mean, Stone Mother?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Beyond the sea of stars is not the 'beyond'. It is merely a corner of the land. If not for the High Wall blocking the way, I should have long departed ten thousand years ago. Furthermore, after being sundered and divided, I lost the ability to traverse the starry sky. Helplessly, the matter was dropped, and so many years have passed in the blink of an eye."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene before Sun Erlang's eyes suddenly changed. The blue line, originally flying in a straight line through the starry sea, inexplicably changed direction and plunged towards the Xuanhuang Realm. Discovered by cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm, with its assistance, the Taiyan Sect leaped to become a renowned sect in the world. The sundered entity, with no hope of recovery. Unexpectedly, the Xuanhuang Realm underwent drastic changes, and calamities descended. To resist the tribulation of 'laws cannot be cultivated simultaneously,' the Taiyan Sect cultivators proactively decided to merge with the Dao-Transformation Stone. Information immortal, Dao-Transformation reappears. After tens of thousands of years of separation and rejoining, the Dao-Transformation Stone returned to its initial state upon arriving in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Scene after scene flashed by, deeply shaking Sun Erlang. He couldn't help but ask, "Senior has been in the Xuanhuang Realm for so long, possessing near omniscience. As long as you remain in the Xuanhuang, remaining unharmed through all tribulations is not a mere illusion. Why must you leave? Outside the sea of stars, there are too many variables and unknowns. Even you, Senior, likely have no absolute certainty of survival, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why must I leave? The answer to this question is the same as why you cultivators must cultivate." The Stone Mother's words rendered Sun Erlang speechless. "The High Wall blocks the sea of stars. But some things, it cannot stop," the Dao-Transformation Stone Mother's tone was inexplicable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a sense of bewilderment and an inexplicable surge of confidence, she continued, "Little one, you don't need to overthink. I'm merely planning to take a look first. If I truly cannot cross the High Wall, we might return. As for why I wanted to meet you this time…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusory blue line before Sun Erlang's eyes suddenly became solidified, shooting directly towards Sun Erlang's head. Before he could react, Sun Erlang was struck by the blue beam. He inspected his body but felt no abnormality. Only the Dao-Transformation Stone crystal in his sea of consciousness seemed to have become slightly different.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Little one, there's no need to be nervous. It's just a marker, lest we lose our way when we plan to return."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, we won't mistreat you. Concentrate…" The Stone Mother's words coincided with the flashing of the Dao-Transformation Stone. In Sun Erlang's perception, countless images surged, almost overwhelming his sea of consciousness. He quickly composed himself, slowing down the reception of the images. These numerous scenes depicted the Sacred Dynasty in bitter battles with heavy casualties, and also the Sacred Dynasty achieving victory after victory, forcing the Myriad Immortals Alliance to cling to survival in the central four prefectures. However, without exception, all were events that had not yet occurred in the real world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"These are my deductions, presented to you as reference." Sun Erlang felt relieved and hastily thanked the Stone Mother.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, I must warn you, do not place too much faith in these deductions."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Xuanhuang Realm is like a bottomless pond. If it's calm, every ripple on the surface can be deduced. But if the ferocious beasts at the bottom all surface, churning the waters…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The deduction of the ripples will inevitably diverge greatly from reality. Your Master will surely understand this principle."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"So, whether our Taiyan Sect is here or not, it won't change things much." The Dao-Transformation Stone Mother's voice still echoed in his ears. Snapping back to reality, Sun Erlang found himself outside the Taiyan Sect. The previously inconspicuous crystal wall had inexplicably gained a layer of mysterious blue light. The entire Taiyan Sect became even more transparent, as if it could disappear from this world at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Young Master, you must live well."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Otherwise, our Taiyan Sect won't be able to find its way home," Yi Shu's voice echoed with a smile, as if a hallucination. In his bewilderment, the floating celestial city before his eyes had already vanished from Sun Erlang's senses.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To leave just like that, it's too fast," Sun Erlang muttered, feeling a sense of wistful loss. He stood there for a long time before returning to report the entire incident to his Master in detail. Looking at the Faceless Saint Emperor seated above, silent, Sun Erlang felt a little nervous. However, the Saint Emperor's subsequent words left him somewhat stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What marker? It's merely the Stone Mother's jest. The Dao-Transformation Divine Stone is an unparalleled treasure. That Rainbow Light Sword Message, even I, couldn't decipher it for a while, yet she cracked it in such a short time…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"She can trace its origin and traverse the sea of stars, how could she possibly lose her way?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, that…" Sun Erlang was somewhat confused, "The profound feeling when the blue line collided with the Dao-Transformation Stone in my sea of consciousness was indeed real." The Saint Emperor smiled, a rare occurrence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is your good fortune."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"All Dao-Transformation Stones in the world, strictly speaking, are merely fragments separated from the Stone Mother. Although cultivators can use the Dao-Transformation Divine Method to claim them as their own, fragments are still fragments. Even the highest quality Dao-Transformation Stone cannot compare to the Stone Mother. However, that blue radial light the Stone Mother used on you is like turning stone into gold…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's tone was somewhat peculiar, "Although its quality is currently only top-grade, it has been enlightened and now possesses infinite potential."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it will become another Stone Mother in time."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This…" To think that after leaving, she would bestow such a grand fortune upon him. Sun Erlang was left stunned. "Don't overthink it. Everyone has their own fortune. Perhaps the Stone Mother simply found you agreeable," the Saint Emperor said indifferently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes…" Although Sun Erlang replied, his expression suggested he hadn't quite come to terms with it yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh, right. Master, those thousands of deduction results from the Stone Mother…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Analyze and report them after you've calmed down."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As you command." Sun Erlang left the Saint Emperor's throne in a daze. Unconsciously, he arrived at the residence of the scholar who wrote the 'Romance of the Xuanhuang's Three Parts', as Yi Shu had mentioned. He saw that a crowd was still gathered at the entrance of the house. Although they hadn't done anything excessive, they were glaring intently at the exit, as if they held an irreconcilable grudge against the scholar inside. Seeing Sun Erlang, their faces lit up, and they eagerly stepped forward, intending to recount the scholar's alleged transgressions. But Sun Erlang interrupted them with a slight frown. The crowd, understanding, dispersed. Sun Erlang strode into the house. The scholar was heavily drunk. Sun Erlang picked up the manuscript from the table and began to read.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-269" class="calibre1">Chapter 1258: Flowing Crystals Lead to Disputes</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The handwriting was extremely hurried, with large sections even smudged and crossed out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Sun Erlang could still grasp the general idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Celestial Empire ruled by Emperor Taiyuan grew increasingly prosperous, with an endless stream of talented individuals. In its conflicts with the other two kingdoms, it achieved repeated victories.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Teacher of Heaven and Earth and the Supreme Sage of Man were forced to join forces to counter the might of Taiyuan…</p>
<p class="calibre2">This plot was clearly not what the scholar truly intended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only was the writing style and wording much weaker than before, but even the attitude towards writing felt perfunctory. Perhaps he couldn't bear it any longer and, unwilling to continue, spent his days drowning his sorrows in alcohol, living in a state of daze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang was not surprised by this outcome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty, the symbols on Emperor Taiyuan and the Faceless Saint Emperor were too similar. As long as he suffered even the slightest setback in the plot, the scholar would be subjected to widespread condemnation. Under such real-world pressure, Emperor Taiyuan could naturally only be continuously successful in the plot. Over time, his strength would far surpass that of the other two sages.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Sun Erlang was somewhat curious about the original direction of the plot the scholar had envisioned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a thought, Sun Erlang sent a strand of his divine sense into the scholar's sea of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before long, amidst the many chaotic thoughts, he found the content related to the "Romance of the Xuanhuang's Three Parts."</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had to be said that the scholar was, after all, a native citizen of the Sacred Dynasty. Having basked in the Saint Emperor's grace for years, his subconscious reverence for the Saint Emperor led him to envision an ending where Emperor Taiyuan, after overcoming various difficulties, suppressed the other two victors one by one, unifying the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this would involve failures and setbacks, and at one point, he would even fall into a desperate situation, with his life hanging by a thread.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang had to admit that compared to the modified version seen in reality, the initial plot arrangement in the scholar's mind was more dramatic and captivating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As the saying goes, writing should be like appreciating mountains, not seeking flatness. In comparison, the version outside is as bland as chewing wax."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Sun Erlang thought this, the content of the book involved his Master, so he didn't dare to act arbitrarily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He flashed back to the Saint Emperor's Throne and reported the matter to Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was merely a small matter, yet for some reason, it caused the Saint Emperor to fall into a long silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Emperor Taiyuan is me, the Supreme Sage of Man is me, and the Teacher of Heaven and Earth is also me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, the Saint Emperor slowly uttered a sentence that echoed in the cold Saint Emperor's Throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang was first stunned, then suddenly enlightened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a look of joy, he departed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Ping's heart, which was usually unshakeable by external matters, was stirred by this incident, creating ripples that could not be calmed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He perhaps understood why the Law Transmitter, after establishing the Myriad Immortals Alliance, had ceased to concern himself with world affairs and did not appear in public view.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Hongze Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming, a Golden Core cultivator stationed in this world by the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty, suddenly received a report from his subordinate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed some unwelcome guests from the Myriad Immortals Alliance had intruded into this small world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Three Nascent Souls, seven Golden Cores."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming's brows furrowed tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although he had immediately sent a distress message to the Sacred Dynasty, the fact that a large-scale [Void Crystal] vein had just been discovered here made Zhang Ming's unease unbearable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Hongze Realm is not large, and the breath carried by the Void Crystal is very unique. Even if I use formations to conceal it slightly, I'm afraid it will be difficult to escape their detection."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems this battle is unavoidable."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming quickly calculated the strength he could currently mobilize.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Including himself, there were only five Golden Cores at most.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The gap in strength was undeniable, and defeat seemed inevitable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If he chose to retreat, the Sacred Dynasty would not impose severe punishment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the pride of a soldier of the Great Qi dictated that Zhang Ming would never withdraw without even the courage to fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming acted decisively and unleashed the only [Sky Shrouding Talisman].</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the name suggests, the Sky Shrouding Talisman could conceal heavenly secrets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As is well known, after cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm perish, celestial phenomena appear in the sky. The life of the fallen cultivator, and even the specific cause of death, are displayed in great detail on the celestial screen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under normal circumstances, it was fine, but in a life-or-death battle like this, the occurrence of casualties on either side would be instantly transmitted, significantly increasing the difficulty of combat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, with the [Sky Shrouding Talisman], the situation could be reversed and even turned into an advantageous combat condition for oneself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sky Shrouding Talisman could not only conceal the celestial phenomena of a cultivator's demise but also precisely identify friend and foe, treating them differently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If our side killed enemy cultivators, no phenomena would be generated. But if one of our cultivators were killed, phenomena would still appear to remind us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the specific principle of this talisman's effectiveness was unknown, there was no doubt that this single Sky Shrouding Talisman could shift the balance of advantage by a fraction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This talisman alone is not enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming looked at a small white jade arrow in his embrace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Unfortunately, given our squad's qualifications, we can only apply for one Army Annihilation Arrow each time we go out."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I could get more, let alone these Nascent Soul cultivators, I wouldn't fear even Soul Transformation cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Army Annihilation Arrow was a weakened version of the Sacred Dynasty's Celestial Patrol Arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although weakened, it could cause devastating damage to cultivators at or below the Nascent Soul stage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, it came with tracking and aura-locking functions; once targeted, escape was impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's only one, it needs to be utilized to its fullest."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, Zhang Ming devised a plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fu Ge!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Reporting, sir!" A mid-stage Golden Core cultivator in a dark yellow uniform responded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Use the [Flowing Stream Talisman] to transport these Void Crystals to here, underground," Zhang Ming marked the specific location on the map.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fu Ge did not hesitate and accepted the storage ring handed over by Zhang Ming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a flash of yellow light, he vanished from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The storage ring contained all that Zhang Ming and his team had mined, only a small portion of this giant vein.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if it were detonated and guided through special means, the scattered aura would be enough to attract the attention of the Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators above.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Bing San!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You arrange formations along the way to impede them. Remember, do not let them have it too easy, nor should you deploy those lethal formations."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A middle-aged man with a dark yellow complexion responded and departed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming meticulously deployed his forces in a short time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even with their unique skills, they were still stretched thin in the face of absolute power disparity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The plan encountered an unexpected hitch in the very first step.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators were not ordinary individuals. The one responsible for luring them to the ambush site was named Qiu Di.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among this team, his遁术 (escape technique) was particularly outstanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unexpectedly, after just a brief encounter, before he could even use his escape technique, he was trapped by a Cavernary Divine Domain displayed by a white-robed man from the Myriad Immortals Alliance group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This Cavernary Divine Domain was quite peculiar. It did not manifest any specific imagery, only emitting white light rings that suppressed Qiu Di.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After trying various methods and seeing no hope of escape,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiu Di resolutely detonated himself, ending his own life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensing the disappearance of his subordinate's life force, Zhang Ming's heart clenched, and his fists tightened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators, evidently, had not expected their opponent to be so resolute. He committed suicide at the slightest disagreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The atmosphere instantly turned bizarre.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait, Brother Lin Bai, something's not right!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a while, someone among them reacted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why is there no phenomenon of demise?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Was it a feigned death?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Unlikely, his soul and spirit were indeed annihilated."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lin Bai's expression turned solemn, and he looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a while, his face grew grim. "Be careful, someone has concealed the heavenly secrets."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite his warning, the others did not become fearful but, instead, extremely excited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Concealed heavenly secrets? Even this seemingly ordinary small world has employed such methods. It seems there's a secret!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We've searched several places in vain, and finally, we're about to find something."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if it's not Void Crystal, if we can uncover the secret of this place, perhaps this trip won't be in vain."</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">While everyone was discussing, they suddenly felt the ground tremble slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, a familiar aura emanated from underground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone was initially stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, with disbelief etched on their faces: "It really is Void Crystal?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">In their perception, besides the dispersed crystal aura, they also seemed to sense several figures rapidly fleeing from the underground tremors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They're abandoning their efforts, trying to escape now that they can't hide it?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone subconsciously thought this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they desperately wanted to investigate immediately, they remained somewhat cautious and did not act rashly, instead looking to Lin Bai in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lin Bai pondered for a moment and quickly made a decision.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Split into two groups. Brother Qian, you take three people to pursue the fleeing cultivators, the rest will go with me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without any further ado, the Myriad Immortals Alliance group quickly split into four, chasing towards the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lin Bai, leading the remaining group, headed towards where the Void Crystal aura originated from underground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Along the way, although formations blocked their path,</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were easily broken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"These formations, at least, were set up by a Nascent Soul formation master."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And many of these formations, I've never seen before. Interesting…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone's excitement grew.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, they arrived at their destination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A massive cavity left by an explosion, with quite a few Void Crystal fragments faintly visible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Damn it! That ruthless! They actually destroyed it all!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What a waste! A fist-sized crystal now costs fifty thousand contribution points! And it's impossible to find!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are still many fragments, quickly pick them up, don't waste them!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Initially, the Myriad Immortals Alliance group maintained some semblance of order.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, upon seeing the ground covered in Void Crystal fragments, their greed was ignited, and they could no longer hold back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Scrambling, they all flew into the cavity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Lin Bai was also tempted, he habitually observed his surroundings first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After seemingly detecting no danger, he also followed them in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Strange, this doesn't look like the original underground vein of the crystal. Could it be their storage depot…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lin Bai picked up a small crystal fragment, and this thought arose in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, his expression suddenly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A small white jade arrow had, at some point, silently shot from the dark depths of the ground towards the cultivators in the cavity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Careful!" Lin Bai instinctively shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He fully activated his Cavernary Divine Domain and deployed hundreds of command flags to protect himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the white jade arrow was faster than they expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An incredibly dazzling light sphere was born underground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it engulfed all the cultivators in the cavity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even their caverns completely dissipated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not far away, watching the deaths of the Myriad Immortals Alliance members, Zhang Ming felt no fluctuation in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Qiu Di, may you rest in peace."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without any further delay, Zhang Ming hurried towards his subordinates who were acting as decoys.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to their side, their situation was quite tragic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without a powerful weapon like the Army Annihilation Arrow, they could only rely on minor tricks to delay. They were quickly caught up by the Myriad Immortals Alliance group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They fell into a bitter struggle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time Zhang Ming led his group to arrive, only two were left desperately holding on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivator named Qian was still trying to persuade them: "Two fellow Daoists, why go through all this trouble? It's just an external object, how can it compare to your own life? We also have no intention of taking your lives…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even as he spoke, his offensive actions did not cease.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The armor on Zhang Ming's body erupted with a crimson glow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Transforming into a red line, it shot directly towards the Qian-named cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Qian, be careful!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, the power gap was too great. Even with the protective armor, it was not enough to compensate for the difference between Golden Core and Nascent Soul.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was still dodged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sneak attack failed, and instead, he was heavily wounded by the opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The armor's light suddenly dimmed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hm? What kind of protective magic artifact is this? It shows no signs of cracking after my full-power strike?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Qian-named cultivator's tone was filled with surprise, and even more so with greed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems we are destined to die here."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming thought to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he had no regrets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By delaying for so long, the Sacred Dynasty's reinforcements should arrive soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before the giant Void Crystal vein was discovered by the Myriad Immortals Alliance, the Sacred Dynasty could reassert control here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"After I die, my family will be proud of me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, I'll even receive a personal commendation from the Saint Emperor."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming's heart was at peace. Looking at the opposing Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators, he coldly said, "Burn your soul!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">His remaining subordinates, hearing this, did not hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As their souls burned, their already weakened aura suddenly surged again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Are you insane?!" The Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators screamed in disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For these doomed individuals, they saw no need to engage them head-on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with their superior strength, the Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators focused on ensuring their own safety and dodging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The power-boosting effect of burning souls gradually faded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming and the others finally reached the end of their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as their consciousness was about to dissipate, Zhang Ming seemed to see a familiar figure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Little General Sun?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming felt a sense of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boundless golden light enveloped him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Ming seemed to see the great Faceless Saint Emperor in a swirling galaxy of stars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang collected the remaining wills of Zhang Ming and the others, then turned his gaze towards the Myriad Immortals Alliance members.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Infinite killing intent instantly enveloped them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moments later, the Myriad Immortals Alliance members became his escort to the afterlife, accompanying the brave warriors of the Sacred Dynasty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang's gaze turned to the quiet sky, and with a thought, he pointed towards the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Phenomena of demise slowly appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they were contrary to the truth, presenting completely fabricated information about their demise.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-270" class="calibre1">Chapter 1259: One Person Becomes an Army</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Instantly, phenomena depicting the demise of the Myriad Immortals Alliance group appeared on the firmament of the Hongze Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Nascent Soul cultivator Lin Bai, cultivated for 165 years…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the Hongze Realm, while competing for Void Crystal, was besieged by Qian Sheng, Qian Ming, and Qian Su, and died after suffering grievous injuries."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"His Dao has passed, and his essence has returned to Heaven!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they were killed by the vanguard detachment of the Sacred Dynasty, the cause of death displayed on the firmament now was a dispute with the "Qian family."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was Sun Erlang's first time using the [Heavenly Usurpation Talisman], and the effect seemed quite good.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang meticulously recorded the scene in the sky with a projection stone, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterward, he found the Void Crystal ore vein in this location based on Zhang Ming's dying message.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He carefully collected it entirely, then intentionally scattered the minor debris that had fallen from the main ore vein across various parts of the Hongze Realm. Finally, he erased all traces of the struggle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After completing all this, Sun Erlang quietly departed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Much later, the obscured and altered heavenly secrets of the Hongze Realm slowly returned to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Myriad Immortals Alliance, Yueyang Prefecture, Qian Family.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Qian family patriarch, Qian Wanling, a peak stage Soul Transformation cultivator, had a somber expression. Standing below him were Qian Sheng, Qian Ming, Qian Su, and others, who still seemed somewhat clueless.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Tell me about the good deeds you've done."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What good deeds?" Qian Sheng was instantly stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Eldest Brother, why did you suddenly summon us here and act like this? What's wrong?" Qian Su also seemed somewhat perplexed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qian Wanling slammed the table violently: "Are you still hiding it! The Lin family has already come knocking! That Lin Bai was the successor the Lin family placed great hope in. You killed him like this, how could they let it go?! Void Crystal is a good thing, but you need to be alive to spend it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Blinded by greed! Utterly foolish!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Patriarch Qian looked at his brothers, his eyes practically spitting fire. If not for the bond of blood, he would have wished to kill them all on the spot with a single palm strike.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait a minute!" Qian Ming suddenly realized, his expression changing, and he hurriedly asked, "What Lin Bai, what Void Crystal, Eldest Brother, you must be mistaken, right? We killed Lin Bai? What a joke?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing that they still refused to admit it, Qian Wanling's heart filled with extreme disappointment. "Hiding even from me for the sake of Void Crystal? Fine, fine, fine!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qian Wanling, enraged, immediately took out a recording stone and released the celestial phenomenon of demise from the Hongze Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the heavenly dao phenomenon before them, the three Qian brothers were instantly dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's not right, Eldest Brother! We really didn't do this!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Someone framed us! Eldest Brother, you must believe us!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief moment of stupor, the three brothers cried out in unison, claiming injustice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qian Wanling stared intently at them, but he couldn't find any flaws in their expressions that suggested pretense.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"These idiotic brats' acting skills aren't this good. Could it be…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point, even Qian Wanling began to hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then where were you three during that time recently?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qian Sheng and the others hesitated upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, under their elder brother's killing gaze, they had no choice but to tell the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That day, we were absorbing solar energy for cultivation in a small pavilion by Yueyang Lake. Suddenly, we sensed an anomaly in a nearby earth vein, as if some treasure was about to appear. So we went to investigate. Unexpectedly, as soon as we arrived, the earth vein's power suddenly went berserk, and we were swept into the earth vein, losing control and acting on instinct…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We only escaped recently," Qian Sheng said truthfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing his elder brother Qian Wanling's increasingly somber gaze, he quickly added, "Really. If you don't believe me, look. Because we were immersed in the earth vein for such a long time, the spiritual energy within my body is inevitably stained with the strong aura of the earth vein."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qian Wanling scanned the three of them and indeed found the clear traces of earth vein power immersion. He then fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The three Qian brothers thought their eldest brother still didn't believe them and were about to continue arguing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only then did Qian Wanling let out a long sigh, "Even if I believe you, what then? Will the Lin family believe it? Will the world believe it?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This recording stone captures images that have been authenticated and cannot be forged."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, it also involves a treasure like [Void Crystal]…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Our Qian family is in trouble."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qian Sheng also slowly came to his senses, his eyes filled with rage. "Who schemed so meticulously to frame us!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qian Ming's eyes were even redder. "Eldest Brother, don't worry, we won't implicate the family."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Saying this, he was about to turn and leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Scoundrel! Are you trying to court death by going out now?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Chided by Qian Wanling, he stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at his three brothers' aggrieved and angry appearances, Qian Wanling sighed again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, he made the decision befitting the patriarch. "At this point, being misunderstood is unavoidable."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We can only report this matter to Lord Fan Li first…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fan Li was a Harmonious Dao cultivator guarding Yueyang Prefecture. He usually disliked staying in Yueyang Heavenly City and had built a small pavilion by Yueyang Lake to reside in.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I will make the trip myself. You three remember to stay at home and do not go out."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qian Wanling instructed seriously, then changed his appearance and left through a secret passage at home.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The bewildered Qian Sheng and the other two were left behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, Fan Li, who was resting in his small pavilion by Yueyang Lake, frowned upon hearing Qian Wanling's account.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the Lin family patriarch, Lin Yufei, also arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Lord Fan, you must uphold justice for our Lin family in this matter!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Lin family's spies stationed outside the small pavilion in Yueyang Lake had seen Qian Wanling appear and immediately notified Lin Yufei.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lin Yufei hurried over and, looking at Qian Wanling sitting solemnly in the pavilion, did not hide the killing intent in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your Qian family is too presumptuous! You completely disregard the laws of the Immortal Alliance!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Lin, please calm your anger. Someone has framed us in this matter," Qian Wanling said with a wry smile and offered an apology.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Framed?! Is that heavenly phenomenon of demise in the recording stone false? Is the image recorded by the recording stone false?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The more Qian Wanling said, the more it seemed like a quibble and an excuse to Lin Yufei, who was already furious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was about to make a move right then.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Quiet."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fan Li snorted coldly, suppressing the confrontation between the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He then carefully examined the images in the recording stone, his brow furrowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The images were not forged.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But he had indeed noticed the anomaly in the earth vein some time ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Qian family would not dare to fool him with such a ridiculous excuse.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What exactly was going on?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For a moment, Fan Li felt a headache coming on.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He knew that if this matter was not handled properly, it could very well become public knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You two, come with me to this Hongze Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fan Li said in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even with Fan Li's personal visit, he could not ascertain the truth from the lingering clues in the Hongze Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was true that there were strong traces of Void Crystal remaining there.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Old thief Qian, Lord Fan personally cast a spell to recreate the phenomenon of demise from the heavenly dao. You saw it with your own eyes, what else do you have to say?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Lin, is it possible that this heavenly phenomenon is fake…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Nonsense! From today onwards, our Lin family and your Qian family are irreconcilable enemies!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the two families whose enmity had not only not been resolved but had deepened further, Fan Li felt a headache.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked up at the sky above the Hongze Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heavenly Dao… has it changed again?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon returning to Yueyang Prefecture and conducting several trials and verifications, Fan Li confirmed that the celestial phenomena of cultivator demise were still effective.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he still had some doubts. Furthermore, Qian Wanling insisted that his three sons were being framed. And after Fan Li personally questioned the souls of the three, he was convinced that they were not the murderers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Helpless, Fan Li had no choice but to report the matter to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unbeknownst to him, this was already the second similar report received by the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, due to the inherent nature of the Immortal Alliance's operational system, such matters had not yet attracted the attention of the truly high-level echelons of the Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Silently, the seeds of chaos had already been sown.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Great Qi.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang, combining the information gathered by various spies of the Sacred Dynasty, was quite satisfied with the effect of the Heavenly Usurpation Talisman.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because over the past thousands of years, the accuracy of the celestial phenomena of cultivator demise had been precisely verified. The cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, who had formed a fixed mindset, naturally would not suddenly doubt it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it can only be used for surprises. If used too often, it will lose its efficacy."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It must be used at critical moments."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He had already truthfully reported the heroic sacrifice of the Zhang Ming squad to the Sacred Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Emperor, in a rare move, had announced this matter to the entire world, and above the Sacred Capital City, he had used his great power to create a floating divine palace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The divine palace shone with golden light, suspended high in the nine heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From any corner of Great Qi, one could see the divine palace's brilliance, like a sun in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Emperor declared that any soldier who sacrificed themselves for the Sacred Dynasty would have their statue formed in the divine palace after death.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they had lost their physical forms, they would be eternally preserved as heroic spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden, light-emitting specters of Zhang Ming and the others, emerging from the floating divine palace, confirmed the Sacred Emperor's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The citizens of Great Qi cheered for the Sacred Emperor's divine grace, and their fear of death slowly transformed into a fervent desire to enter the floating divine palace and become immortal heroic spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang knew that these so-called heroic spirits were likely remnants of will preserved by his Master with divine power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it was still far from true eternal life and immortality, it was still a method of salvation after death.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Rather than having their souls and spirits completely annihilated, leaving behind a final trace in the world was still valuable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But for Sun Erlang, the proper way was to minimize the sacrifice of soldiers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He arrived at the secret location where the Sacred Dynasty forged weapons of war.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Both the Army Annihilation Arrow and the Heavenly Usurpation Talisman originated from here.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Greetings, Craftsman Elder."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang said to the busy Craftsman Ascetic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Craftsman did not reply, but focused intently on the black puppets rapidly flashing in the space before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang did not mind and also looked at the puppets.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Such speed."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The black puppet constantly teleported, its body floating, even evading Sun Erlang's divine sense lock.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Too slow! Still too slow!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Origin Force supply is limited; to unleash the potential of mass-produced models to the extent of imagination is still somewhat insufficient."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Craftsman said with regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Youngster Sun, go up and spar with him."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Craftsman suddenly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang nodded and instantly appeared in the testing grounds.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The black puppet stopped its rapid movement and launched a full-power assault on Sun Erlang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There were two main attack methods: one was a black death ray sprayed out, containing annihilation energy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other was to detonate formation modules and use standard formations to trap and injure enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was almost enough to contend with an ordinary peak Nascent Soul cultivator, but it was clearly unable to harm Sun Erlang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While easily evading the black puppet's attacks, Sun Erlang flicked several blue light orbs.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The orbs transformed into various curves, accurately locking onto and hitting the black puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A faint glow flashed on the puppet, surprisingly absorbing Sun Erlang's moves.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Kid, you didn't see this last time you visited, did you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This move is called 'using one's own methods against them'."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Craftsman said this, and faint blue light emanated from the black puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Those blue orbs were actually being reflected back.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is just one puppet; the advantage of mass production lies in numbers."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Craftsman spoke, dozens more puppets appeared in the testing space in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the battle against them, Sun Erlang discovered that these puppets seemed to be a single entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only did they coordinate well, forming formations, but any single puppet could concentrate and reflect the attacks absorbed by the entire group.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with Sun Erlang's considerable strength, facing more than thirty puppets without using his killing moves, he began to struggle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He stopped the test and returned to the Craftsman's side.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Craftsman Elder, how many mass-produced puppets like this can be deployed at once?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Craftsman shrugged. "Kid, this is a secret of the Sacred Dynasty. Even as the Saint Emperor's personal disciple, I can't tell you too much detail."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang was rendered speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Craftsman laughed heartily. "Just joking."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"[Sacred Army Puppets], in groups of fifty, require manipulation by special cultivators to exert their greatest strength."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"They should be sufficient to deal with Soul Transformation cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A glint flashed in Sun Erlang's eyes upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is there an upper limit to the number of Sacred Army Puppets that can be controlled?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Upper limit?" The Craftsman was slightly taken aback and then understood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You want to try?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Craftsman pondered for a moment and handed over a black jade disk.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't push yourself."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang took the disk, and in his sea of consciousness, an image of thousands of black puppets standing neatly in formation appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His thoughts became like a thread, connecting all these puppets.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Each puppet seemed to have its own consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After connecting, Sun Erlang's own soul felt as if it were tethered by something heavy, becoming somewhat sluggish.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it also allowed him to control the puppets as if they were his own limbs.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang accustomed himself to the puppet's movements. With a thought, one of the puppets flew into the testing grounds.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He began experiments on flight and attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a period of adaptation, Sun Erlang felt the burden on his soul had become negligible.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He then began connecting to other puppets.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, the third, the tenth, the fiftieth…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the Craftsman Ascetic's gradually astonished gaze, the number of puppets controlled by Sun Erlang exceeded one hundred.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And judging by his expression, he still seemed to be handling it with ease.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You kid…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not bad!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Craftsman Ascetic suddenly had a flash of inspiration. "If you were to control the Sacred Army Puppets alone, would the effect be even better?"</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-271" class="calibre1">Chapter 1260: Sword Pointing at the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang did not respond to Qiaogong's words, for his limits far exceeded that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One hundred, two hundred, five hundred…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only when the number of black puppets emerging in the testing ground exceeded a thousand, to Qiaogong Jushi’s astonished gaze, did Sun Erlang stop summoning more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hundreds of black puppets fought amongst themselves, each employing different combat methods, giving no indication they were being controlled by a single person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even having achieved this level, Sun Erlang still had the energy to chat with Qiaogong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Senior, you jest. I am the Saint Emperor’s first disciple, and in the future, I will conquer the Myriad Immortals Alliance. I will be a commander, not a mere general. Moreover, although these puppets are powerful…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I am not weak either.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang’s tone was filled with confidence. “I can have my subordinates control these puppets. I refuse to believe that the Sacred Army Puppets you forged can be more numerous than our Sacred Dynasty’s soldiers.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong waved his hand, saying with a look of disdain, “No, no, no, you misunderstand, my boy. I’m not talking about these ordinary Sacred Army Puppets. I’m talking about this kind…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he spoke, with flashes of black light, the thousand-plus puppets summoned by Sun Erlang disappeared one after another from the testing ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A spatial rift appeared in their place, and a colossal puppet, shining with golden light like the Divine Hall of Heroes in the Sacred Dynasty’s sky, descended into their midst.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A mysterious and majestic aura swept through the entire training ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding seals groaned under the immense impact, as if they would shatter at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden puppet’s eyes, like a deity overlooking the mortal world, stared at Sun Erlang&mdash;cold and devoid of emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being locked onto by the other party, Sun Erlang inexplicably felt as if he were facing his own master.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is this…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang looked at Qiaogong Jushi with surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong said with undisguised pride, “This is a powerful puppet that truly represents my highest craftsmanship. The black Sacred Army Puppets just now were merely common goods, expendable materials for war.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Think about it yourself; such high-end items, how could I possibly let you test them without any preparation?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang felt a bit embarrassed at hearing this, but his attention quickly returned to the golden puppet standing silently before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Senior, how is this puppet’s strength?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong said proudly, “Don’t take it the wrong way, young man. Although you are the Saint Emperor’s eldest disciple, if it came down to a real fight, you might not even be a match for this puppet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang narrowed his eyes but did not retort.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong continued, “This puppet is not like the mass-produced ones. Each one is personally crafted by me, and bestowed by the Saint Emperor…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong paused. “Heh heh, suffice it to say, this golden puppet is extremely precious. Even with the entire Sacred Dynasty’s resources, we couldn’t forge more than ten of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Similarly, the control requirements are greatly increased. I was quite troubled before, wondering where to find suitable operators. I didn’t expect you to have such a hidden skill…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You can control over a thousand mass-produced puppets simultaneously, so controlling five golden puppets should be no problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The gap is that large?” Sun Erlang furrowed his brow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Heh heh, you’ll know once you try.” Qiaogong placed a golden sphere into Sun Erlang’s sea of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">*Boom!*</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene before him shattered like glass. In an instant, he seemed to have transitioned from the testing ground to an endless, dark starry sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before him, two gigantic cinnabar-golden spheres emitted intense heat and light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang was unconsciously drawn to them, and as he approached, he realized they were the two eyes of the golden puppet!</p>
<p class="calibre2">His consciousness was instantly absorbed. When Sun Erlang regained his senses, he looked at his hands in a daze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His original body was no longer perceptible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His current body had somehow become that golden puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang could clearly feel the surging, unknown power flowing and operating within him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he stood there in a daze, Qiaogong’s voice echoed from beside him, “I will teleport you to a special hunting ground outside the Great Qi small world. You can test this puppet body to your heart’s content there.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding space distorted, and Sun Erlang instantly found himself in a dark void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Faintly, he could see the scene of the Sacred Dynasty surrounded by numerous small worlds in the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Roar!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A silver-scaled giant python, tens of thousands of feet long, suddenly appeared from nowhere, opening its gaping maw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the next moment, it was about to swallow the golden puppet controlled by Sun Erlang whole.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Sun Erlang made no defensive move. He simply allowed a faint halo to emanate from the puppet’s surface.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The silver-scaled python, as if ignited by flames, let out a mournful howl and turned into ashes, dying in agony.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The python’s death was like a stone dropped into a pond, creating ripples.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hundreds of unknown ferocious beasts emerged from the darkness, seemingly devoid of any reason, and attacked Sun Erlang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang could clearly feel that these ferocious beasts, specially cultivated by the Sacred Dynasty, each possessed a strength no less than that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But facing their encirclement…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang extended his left hand and gently brushed it as if plucking a zither.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The space rippled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ferocious beasts, brimming with killing intent, still retained their expressions from before death. However, their bodies were instantly torn into countless fragments, raining down like drops of water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Law power.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Spatial Law.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang quietly looked at his left hand, a sense of enlightenment dawning upon him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Concurrently with this epiphany, he seemed to glimpse a figure hidden within his own body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Heaven and Earth Essence?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even after unleashing a killing move, Sun Erlang, while controlling the golden puppet, felt no fatigue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppet’s energy seemed inexhaustible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A puppet stronger than Dao Integration?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang was certain that the move he just executed so effortlessly could heavily wound a Dao Integration cultivator of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And this was far from the golden puppet’s combat limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No wonder Senior Qiaogong said I’m not its match.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While his heart was filled with disbelief, Sun Erlang also felt a sense of loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Saint Emperor’s first disciple, he enjoyed countless resources. Moreover, he had the fortuitous encounters from the Taiyan Sect…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, in the end, he was still inferior to a casually crafted puppet?</p>
<p class="calibre2">What was the meaning of his cultivation then?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he was lost in thought, the golden puppet flickered, and it returned to the testing ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang also detached himself from the puppet’s body, returning to his original self.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fragile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An extreme sense of contrast immediately arose within Sun Erlang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Heh heh, you’re feeling discouraged, aren’t you? Actually, there’s no need for that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The resources we spent on the golden puppet could have, if simply piled up, trained a normal cultivator to the Dao Integration stage.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong patted Sun Erlang’s shoulder. “You must have also felt it, right? Each puppet contains the power of a Heaven and Earth Essence. With such an Essence as its core, these puppets, when fighting in the Xuanhuang Realm environment, are like fish in water, gaining nearly a third of their combat strength.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Furthermore, if the same person controls multiple puppets…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong’s tone suddenly became somewhat excited. “The puppets can lend each other the Law power of their respective Essences!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Their burst combat power in a short period can increase severalfold!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang looked at the golden, majestic puppet standing like a deity in the testing space, speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There will be a war between the Sacred Dynasty and the Myriad Immortals Alliance in the future. What will truly determine the course of the war is high-end combat power. How many Dao Integration cultivators does the Myriad Immortals Alliance have? At least nearly a thousand. And how many disciples does the Saint Emperor have?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Besides, you are all still too young. Compared to the veteran Dao Integration cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, you might not gain the upper hand. You can’t expect the Saint Emperor to personally intervene against these Dao Integration cultivators, can you?” Qiaogong Jushi’s tone was melancholic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“At the highest realm, whoever reveals themselves first means they are the first to expose their weakness. Kid, you need to prepare yourself psychologically. In the future war, the Saint Emperor might not act easily.” Sun Erlang nodded. “I understand this principle, of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“With these golden puppets, we can significantly alter the power gap between us. Sun kid, do you want to give it a try?” Qiaogong asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As long as you can control three of them simultaneously, annihilating a Myriad Immortals Alliance Dao Integration cultivator will be effortless,” Qiaogong guaranteed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang slowly nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Saint Emperor’s Throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The conversation between the eldest disciple and Qiaogong naturally did not escape the Saint Emperor’s notice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden puppet, with Origin Force essence and Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth Essence as its core, performed miracles, turning decay into magic. It used pure resources to create puppets that could crush Dao Integration combat power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The inspiration for this naturally came from Tianyang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, Tianyang himself, under the modification of golden Origin Force and Qiaogong, had already surpassed Dao Integration, reaching the Longevity Realm. And…</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was not far from reaching the limit of mortality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, regrettably, there seemed to be some kind of restraint in the dark. Tianyang’s own progress experience did not apply to other puppets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with the exact same crafting plan, the later puppets were inferior to Tianyang by an entire major realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides the fact that Tianyang had merged with the puppet, a unique factor of his own, Li Ping speculated, there were more profound principles involved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The first to tread a path fully realizes their Dao. Just like attaining the nameless True Immortal’s Dao, one’s path cannot be trespassed upon. It is the same with these puppets.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“However, the limitations seem even more stringent.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, with the help of Tianyang and these current golden puppets, Li Ping was already quite satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">War, in essence, was about who had more trump cards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Myriad Immortals Alliance was indeed unfathomable, but the resources he could utilize were not few.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, there was one point Qiaogong had guessed wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“True powerhouses do not lack weaknesses.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rather, they are not afraid of others targeting their weaknesses.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this war against the Myriad Immortals Alliance, he would not be hiding behind the scenes the entire time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise, how could he live up to the name of Saint Emperor?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Transmit the Law.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping sat calmly, his gaze piercing through the firmament, reaching beyond the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In his hand, he toyed with a brilliant, seven-colored crystal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Void Crystal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Through the sensory records of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, Li Ping had initially grasped the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s Rainbow Light Escape technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He decided to borrow the puppet’s body and travel to the depths of the starry sea before the war began.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not to engage in an early battle with the Law Transmitter, but to comprehend the Dao in the starry sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This battle, I shall surely win.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor’s conviction had never wavered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Derivation Law Jade space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensing the faint belief emanating from his clone, Li Fan nodded slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although his perception of the Saint Emperor was growing weaker due to the Saint Emperor’s increasing strength,</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor’s actions were steadily progressing towards the predetermined course.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Coupled with the contingencies he had left behind, Li Fan wasn’t afraid of any unexpected turns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, as long as the goal of forcing out the Law Transmitter was achieved…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“One thought returns to truth, all is illusion.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having meditated in the Derivation Law Jade space for such a long time, Li Fan himself had greatly benefited from the continuous insights from the Saint Emperor and the Saint Embryo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially after touching upon the higher laws beyond the Xuanhuang’s limits in the starry sea, Li Fan had gained thoughts on his future path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Although I am constrained by the new laws, I can find alternative paths.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The Law Transmitter’s system relies on the Xuanhuang Realm itself. If I were to start anew in the starry sea, I could avoid its restrictions.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“However, doing so would mean I couldn’t receive the Xuanhuang’s assistance. There are pros and cons. Moreover, resources are scarce in the starry sea; to truly achieve anything, I might need to rely on the Mystic Immortal Boat.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“And that intangible High Wall.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It seems to be a power completely different from the Absolute Darkness Star Sea system. However, it can restrict the power of True Immortals; its strength is beyond imagination. If I could learn from it, perhaps it could be used as a surprise tactic in future battles with the Law Transmitter.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The only concern is…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan frowned slightly. “The Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician had left the Xuanhuang Realm much earlier than I did. Their talents must also surpass mine.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“All the insights I have discovered so far, they must have found long ago as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, the so-called advantage… is not an advantage at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It seems only a real battle will reveal the truth.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his reincarnation cycles increased, the veil of mystery surrounding the Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician was gradually lifted. Li Fan, who initially avoided them at all costs, now increasingly wished to test them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps the day he can truly defeat them was not far off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then thought of the Cat Treasure that the Saint Emperor’s clone had found.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If there was anything he was particularly concerned about, it was this treasure from beyond the High Wall that had not been fished up before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The angler is also being fished…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A strange glint flashed in Li Fan’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The peculiar behavior of the entire Crossing Calamity Sect towards the Cat Treasure made Li Fan ponder many possibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this was still speculation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor’s clone had also sensed this anomaly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Going to the First Origin Sect to collect the remnants of the wind calamity and the Great Law Master’s remains was also driven by this consideration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">While Li Fan was contemplating, the long-quiet Derivation Law Jade space was suddenly broken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone had come to visit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Sun Luyuan from the Sun family.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lu’er, joyous news, joyous news!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After greeting the other two Dao Integration cultivators guarding the space, Sun Luyuan said to Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan’s reaction, however, made Sun Luyuan slightly startle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Bloodline resonance, how could I not know?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How is Ningjiu?” Li Fan asked, suppressing a smile at the corner of his lips.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan sighed slightly, “Ningjiu has unfortunately passed away. However, the fetus is unharmed. This is also why I’ve come to find you so late, fearing you might not be able to accept it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan changed the subject. “Do you know how extraordinary that little one is? Born as a Dao Integration…”</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-272" class="calibre1">Chapter 1261: Cat Treasure Triple Change</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan lectured on, while Li Fan seemed unable to recover from the shock and grief of learning of his wife's demise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Time and fate. No wonder I've been feeling uneasy for some time now."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Trapped here, I couldn't even see her one last time," Li Fan said with a mournful expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"My son, does he have a name yet?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan calmly replied, "Sun Tianci. Ninglu personally gave our son that name before she passed."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief silence, Li Fan spoke both sorrowfully and with a touch of comfort, "Tianci... a good name."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After discussing Sun Tianci, Sun Luyuan's expression gradually turned serious as he broached the main topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your eldest uncle, Sun Luchang, is leaving."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan briefly recounted the story of the sword light appearing in the sky, bringing news from the Profound Merchant Immortal Ship from beyond the sea of stars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was somewhat surprised. "If that's the case, venturing beyond the starry sky is hardly a good thing. Can it be declined?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan shook his head. "The current situation is that the upper-tier families of the Immortal Alliance who know the truth are avoiding it like the plague, while those in the lower tiers who are unaware are fighting to go. To have more scapegoats, they naturally won't reveal the truth to them. It's truly ironic."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although eldest uncle is at the Harmonious Dao cultivation level, he's grown accustomed to a comfortable life these past few years. I'm afraid..." Li Fan said with slight worry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I weren't guarding here and couldn't get away, I would have gone in place of eldest uncle to explore beyond the stars."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words were spoken with finality, fitting Sun Ang's previous demeanor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan didn't doubt him, merely showing displeasure. "Our Sun family is attracting too much attention: guarding the Derivation Law Jade, venturing beyond the stars... these arrangements are hard to say don't carry the implication of deliberate suppression by the Immortal Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't overthink it. Just live your days here with peace of mind."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without revealing to Li Fan that the Sun family had already pledged allegiance to the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty, Sun Luyuan merely cautioned Li Fan to prioritize prudence in all matters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I've already spoken to Elder Xu."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps you won't have to stay the full three hundred years to succeed and get out."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan said this before his departure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Patriarch, you are too thoughtful," Li Fan replied with gratitude.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh, right. I've been meditating here for several years, summarizing my lifelong studies, and have made some progress."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Patriarch, perhaps you could pass this piece, 'Righteous Law Ascendant,' to Tianci for me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he spoke, a seemingly ordinary piece of text appeared in Sun Luyuan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Scanning it, there was nothing particularly special. It was merely a common method for tempering the mind and clarifying aspirations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan nodded and immediately agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He then took his leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only after Sun Luyuan's figure disappeared did Li Fan sneer inwardly, "Over a hundred years, it's questionable if the Xuanhuang Realm can even survive that long."</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he knew that countless Immortals Alliance cultivators were secretly monitoring here, so he didn't dwell on it, just a fleeting thought in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for "Righteous Law Ascendant," it was a seed planted for Sun Tianci's future rise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the Derivation Law Jade, which was again slacking off and feigning diligence, and could not help but earnestly exhort and admonish it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the Sacred Dynasty's secret military testing ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping, along with Qiaogong, watched Sun Erlang earnestly manipulating the third [Sacred Punishment Divine Puppet].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sacred Punishment Divine Puppet was the name Li Ping had given to the golden puppet, to distinguish it from the ordinary Sacred Army Puppets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Young Master Sun truly has extraordinary talent, with terrifying adaptability. He's already got the hang of the third divine puppet this quickly. Who knows, he might even be able to control all our reserve divine puppets," Qiaogong praised without restraint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Compared to this, everyone in my Spiritual Yuan Sect is just trash."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Speaking of which, you've been in the Sacred Dynasty. Is the Spiritual Yuan Sect in Nine Mountains Prefecture alright?" Li Ping asked casually, his gaze fixed on Sun Erlang in the testing ground, sweat dripping from his forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong waved his hand. "There's my puppet guarding Nine Mountains Prefecture. Those idiots, every time they see me, they're deferential and dare not look up. How could they possibly tell the difference?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point, Qiaogong paused. "But if I calculate the time, the Immortal Alliance's tax collector should be arriving soon. Perhaps I'll have to go back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping knew that Qiaogong collecting large amounts of Origin Force in Nine Mountains Prefecture using the Myriad Beings Origin Force Technique was permitted by the Immortal Alliance. The price was that he had to hand over a portion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A large portion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Alliance shouldn't be lacking in resources, why are they so concerned about your little bit?" Li Ping asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong dismissed it with a wave of his hand. "Who knows? Maybe it's something unethical they themselves find inconvenient to do openly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong seemed to recall something. "Now that you mention it, I remember. When that Immortal Alliance envoy came last time, they casually mentioned that the Immortal Alliance seemed to have a significant internal deficit, and could only cut costs."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I joked with them then, saying that the Immortal Alliance looks prosperous, but turns out to be a pauper."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping fell into contemplation upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Origin Force is merely pure, masterless cultivation. Ordinary cultivators don't need it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Interesting."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the Immortal Alliance envoy comes this time, I'll go meet them on your behalf," Li Ping decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Excellent, excellent." Qiaogong, unable to break away, was overjoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He immediately transmitted the details of their previous meetings to Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh, right. How about the puppet body I asked you to prepare?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong's face showed pride as he clapped his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, a faceless body instantly appeared before Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike the Saint Emperor's towering three-zhang three-cun physique, this faceless body was only normal human size.</p>
<p class="calibre2"> However, it could be considered a perfectly scaled-down version, its exterior almost indistinguishable from Li Ping's.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the Saint Emperor were too suspicious, he might even accuse Qiaogong of disrespect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, he merely stared at the puppet body with interest, somewhat surprised. "It's actually a genuine flesh and blood body?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong nodded. "Yes. Didn't you say you wanted to use it to travel to the starry sky? The sea of stars is full of dangers, and some strange places can only be sensed by a true flesh and blood body. I suffered a great loss before coming to Xuanhuang."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A flicker of pain flashed in Qiaogong's eyes, and he continued introducing the puppet to the Saint Emperor. "I referenced Tianyang's 'Body Fulfilling the Dao' and your precious disciple's flesh and blood cultivation techniques."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This flesh and blood puppet's cultivation potential is not something to expect, but it has complete sensory perception. And like the Sacred Army Divine Puppets, it can integrate the World Essence and Origin Force essence. Although its strength will be discounted due to its naturally frail body, its strength should be sufficient for self-preservation in the starry sky as long as it's careful at the Harmonious Dao level."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As long as it doesn't encounter the strange calamities in the void," Qiaogong said cautiously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A gleam of golden light shot from his fingertip, infusing into the flesh and blood puppet before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sense of familiarity, like a clone, or an extension of his own arm, arose from his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor carefully examined the familiar yet unfamiliar sensations flowing through him, and a glimmer of understanding dawned upon him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'll take this body."</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a flash of golden light, the Saint Emperor and the flesh and blood puppet body disappeared together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong refocused his attention on Sun Erlang in the testing ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Sacred Dynasty's treasury.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor, avoiding Qiaogong, was modifying the puppet body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His purpose in traveling to the starry sky was for enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had certain requirements for the aptitude of his host body. What Qiaogong couldn't accomplish...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did not mean the Saint Emperor himself could not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He placed his large hand on the flesh and blood puppet's head, slowly infusing the Xuanhuang Heavenly Favor into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor felt a sense of déjà vu, and the movements of his hand paused slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of contemplation, he suppressed this anomaly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The initially stiff shell gradually became more lively.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As various heavenly materials and earthly treasures in the Sacred Dynasty's treasury were refined into liquid by Origin Force essence and integrated into the puppet body...</p>
<p class="calibre2">This body became increasingly translucent and fragrant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even Cat Treasure, which had been sleeping soundly, was attracted. It suddenly awoke and looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon discovering that the source of the fragrance was the body Li Ping was refining, its eyes showed a hint of disappointment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as it was about to go back to sleep, it received instructions from the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cat Treasure reluctantly shook its head but, unable to resist the temptation of the promised Origin Force essence, let out a lazy meow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, with a leap, it transformed into a blue, transparent glass cover, enveloping the body Li Ping was refining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fine blue light was released from the container, drifting for a moment before seeping into the puppet body's interior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Ping, with a sliver of consciousness attached to the puppet body, could personally feel the changes occurring within it as it bathed in the blue light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Flesh and blood reorganization, sublimation of life form."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even without cultivation, the strength of this body already surpasses that of Nascent Soul cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm in the general sense."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor carefully sensed the differences between this body and his original body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He couldn't yet comprehend the consequences of these differences, but he was almost certain that these changes were made to cope with some special circumstances.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the blue light cover continuously remodeled the body, a flash of enlightenment crossed Li Ping's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He could even use Cat Treasure's function to infuse the unique abilities of the creatures Cat Treasure had previously absorbed and mimicked into this body, turning them into innate divine abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, being a man-made body, doing so might lead to unpredictable changes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The divine abilities Cat Treasure currently possessed were all non-essential to Li Ping. With the journey to the starry sea imminent, Li Ping decided against this unnecessary step for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He could try it slowly in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The blue light cover grew dimmer, and finally, the light completely dissipated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cat Treasure looked as if it had fought a three-day, three-night battle, its face haggard, and even its originally lustrous fur seemed somewhat yellowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping fed it a large mouthful of golden Origin Force essence, and Cat Treasure, satisfied, fell into a deep slumber.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Item duplication, creature mimicry, this is Cat Treasure's third function."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Marrow cleansing."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Truly remarkable!" Li Ping exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppet body had awakened from its sublimation. Li Ping sensed it, and this body felt even more suitable for his divine soul than his original one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why not directly switch bodies?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A thought irrepressibly surged from the depths of his mind, but it was quickly suppressed by the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cat Treasure's marrow cleansing function was not a one-time affair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the effect was so good on the puppet body, it would naturally be even better on his original body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was still plenty of time, and he had opportunities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping focused his will on the puppet body, beginning to adapt and attempt to control it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Half a month later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before the puppet body could even fly out of Xuanhuang, it received a communication reminder from Qiaogong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The envoy from the Immortal Alliance was about to arrive at the Spiritual Yuan Sect in Nine Mountains Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A flash of golden light enveloped Li Ping, and he instantly transformed into the appearance of Qiaogong Jushi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Silently, he appeared at the headquarters of the Spiritual Yuan Sect, awaiting the arrival of the Immortal Alliance envoy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the puppet body left behind by Qiaogong had already prepared the vast amounts of Origin Force that had been collected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping disdained such low-quality energy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not to mention comparing it to Origin Force essence, even compared to the Origin Force generated by the citizens of the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty cultivating the Spiritual Yuan Technique, it was far inferior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Immortal Alliance envoy, after a brief inspection, was overjoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The quality of this submission seems to have improved significantly?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Sect Master is thoughtful." The Immortal Alliance envoy praised, carefully collecting the sphere of light containing the Origin Force.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping, mimicking Qiaogong's tone, smiled and replied, "Recently, I've learned a profound technique that can invisibly clear the complex thoughts of the disciples, allowing them to dedicate more time to cultivating techniques."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance envoy's eyes lit up. "There's such a divine technique?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What? Is the Envoy also interested?" Li Ping asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance envoy seemed a little embarrassed. "The Immortal Alliance's deficit has grown larger recently. If it's convenient for the Sect Master..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping waved his hand. "It's nothing, just a minor skill. If the Envoy is interested, I will explain it to you."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mind unclouded, spirit centered. All laws repelled, reaching the profound..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Ping spoke, he chanted, directly reciting this profound technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance envoy was overjoyed and listened intently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He failed to notice that his spirit was slowly falling under the influence of the other party's gentle chanting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the Immortal Alliance envoy's eyes became vacant and he fell into a complete stupor, Li Ping smiled faintly and flicked a speck of golden light into the envoy's sea of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, there was a defense from the Immortal Alliance's restrictions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, with the Originvital Essence stealthily infiltrating, the defenses were like paper, silently breached.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, Li Ping found the information he desired in the envoy's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The power of a myriad cultivators, condensed into a piercing spear."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Directly reaching the depths of Xuanhuang, the endless Sea of Darkness..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping had always been curious about how the Immortal Alliance found and maintained the entrance to the Sea of Darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because according to the confessions of the You Clan, the passage opened by the Immortal Alliance in the Sea of Darkness differed significantly from the traditional method of the You Clan's opening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps they did not fully trust the You Clan, or perhaps the Immortal Alliance wanted to firmly control the passage to the Sea of Darkness for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the Immortal Alliance devised a method to use highly condensed Origin Force to directly open a passage between the Xuanhuang Realm and the Sea of Darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is precisely because the Immortal Alliance covets the Nether Realm that the power of the Sea of Darkness continues to shrink."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems it's time to sever some of their tentacles first."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-273" class="calibre1">Chapter 1262: Origin of the Star Sea</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Related to the Nether Realm was a top secret of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The envoy knew little more information beyond that. To avoid alarming them, Li Ping did not take any further action against the envoy. When the Myriad Immortals Alliance envoy, named Jia Su, gradually woke up, he was completely unaware that the secrets in his mind had already been thoroughly scrutinized by the person before him. He was still full of praise, saying, "Your Excellency's divine art is truly extraordinary. Even when I read it, I unconsciously entered a state of selflessness."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping chuckled, "It would be great if it could be useful to the Myriad Immortals Alliance. However, can the proportion of Origin Force submitted annually be discussed further?" Before he could finish speaking, the envoy's expression changed slightly. He said earnestly, "Everything can be discussed, Your Excellency. But the tasks of the Myriad Immortals Alliance cannot be taken lightly." The envoy hesitated, then lowered his voice, "To be honest, originally, higher-ups planned to collect even more..." Seeing Li Ping's extremely displeased expression, as if he might erupt at any moment, the envoy quickly tried to appease him, "But Your Excellency has made a contribution now, right? I'll try to intercede, and perhaps some can be reduced..." Without waiting for Li Ping to react, the Myriad Immortals Alliance envoy quickly bid farewell and left. The Saint Emperor's anger slowly subsided, replaced by an unfathomable calm. Leaving the puppet to continue guarding the Spiritual Yuan Sect disciples, Li Ping returned to the Sacred Dynasty. The profound art left for the Myriad Immortals Alliance was indeed a superior cultivation method that could better develop the Origin Force within cultivators, and it contained no hidden traps. After all, it concerned the Sea of Darkness, and the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not afford to be careless and would have to verify it repeatedly. Li Ping's reason for passing this method to the Myriad Immortals Alliance was that, as its creator, he could roughly sense the location of cultivators practicing this method. He could even sense the Origin Force cultivated by these cultivators under the assistance of this method. The Sea of Darkness was endless and pitch black, swallowing everything. Even the Netherworld Race only moved within their familiar territories. To find the "Piercing Spear" that the Myriad Immortals Alliance had inserted into the Sea of Darkness, some effort was naturally required. However, it would take some time for this method to be widely adopted. Li Ping decided to continue with his unfinished plan of contemplating the Great Dao outside Xuanhuang in the puppet body. After the final touches in the recent days, the puppet body had completely met the Saint Emperor's requirements. Even whenever his consciousness descended upon it, he couldn't help but feel an instinctive urge to switch bodies, and it became stronger and stronger. Li Ping thus reduced the frequency of testing this puppet body. The large amount of Empty Radiant Flowing Crystals collected in the Hongze Realm was also enough for him to break free from the suction of the Immortal Ruins and successfully fly out of Xuanhuang. Without telling anyone, under the concealment of formations and the aura of Xuanhuang's Heavenly Dao, the Rainbow Light silently flew towards the firmament. In an instant, it reached the edge of the world. Deprived of Xuanhuang's protection, the immense suction from the Immortal Ruins caused Li Ping's expression to change. Knowing about the power of True Immortals and personally experiencing it were two entirely different matters. Only when truly facing the vast and mighty power of True Immortals would one understand their own insignificance. Even though he, the Saint Emperor, was among the strongest existences in the Xuanhuang Realm, it was still the case. "The path is long and arduous." The Saint Emperor sighed inwardly, releasing Rainbow Lights one by one to counteract the suction of the Immortal Ruins. The puppet body, however, rapidly flew in the opposite direction. The light of Xuanhuang gradually dimmed, leaving only darkness all around. Unlike the darkness of the Sea of Darkness, the starry sea was utterly dead and silent. And... even though there seemed to be nothing ahead, the Saint Emperor instinctively sensed that danger awaited him there. So he decisively turned, bypassing that area. Afterward, in the deepest parts of the dark sea, whenever there was rampant residual immortal energy that threatened him, he could foresee it and preemptively avoid it. It was as if he had set foot in this starry sea before. The Saint Emperor's puppet body narrowed its eyes and continued deeper into the dark sea, following an imperceptible guidance. He could already feel that the laws in the starry sea had a higher limit than in the Xuanhuang Realm. However, his destination was not beneath the High Wall mentioned in the sword message, but where new limit laws were being gestated in this deep dark starry sea. There, the efficiency of comprehending the Dao would be the highest. The Rainbow Light shuttled rapidly, as if the concept of time had ceased to exist. The Saint Emperor gradually shed the guidance of his premonition and, following the mysterious rhythm surging in the silent starry sea, changed his direction of advance. It was like being in the ocean, finding a fierce current beneath the calm surface. His speed suddenly increased exponentially, covering millions of miles in an instant. The immense forces of tearing raged around him. Even the protective Rainbow Light was torn to shreds by this unknown great power. Li Ping, with a focused mind, ignoring the crisis of his imminent death, quietly contemplated the mysterious changes around him, something never seen in the Xuanhuang Realm. "Ruin and rebirth." "The cultivators of Xuanhuang Realm view this silent starry sky as the deep dark starry sea. But in ways unknown to them, vitality is also slowly reviving within it." "However, it is currently in its most nascent stage. And the entire process is too slow. From the perspective of 'humans,' it is naturally extremely difficult to perceive." "This has nothing to do with comprehension. It is purely a difference dictated by different scales and different life forms." "But..." A peculiar rhythm slowly awakened on the Saint Emperor's puppet body. It was the unique aura of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao! That's right, this time the Saint Emperor secretly sent the puppet body out of Xuanhuang to comprehend the Dao, without informing anyone in the Sacred Dynasty. But how could he hide it from Xuanhuang's Heavenly Dao? At its strong insistence, with the resolve of going without return, it separated a trace of consciousness and attached it to the puppet body. It left Xuanhuang together with it, venturing into the depths of the starry sea. Unlike the purpose from many years ago, this time, Xuanhuang's Heavenly Dao was also here to "learn the Dao"! The deep dark starry sea's limit laws were already exceeding Xuanhuang before its destruction. Although Xuanhuang Realm had survived to this day, its own strength had not advanced over a long period. Considering it had devoured many fragments of immortal cultivation worlds, although occupied by cultivators, it had slightly increased overall compared to before. The new Dao laws being gestured in the deep dark starry sea were naturally a level higher than Xuanhuang Realm's. Of course... For Xuanhuang Realm, observing these nascent beings in the deep dark starry sea was also a great opportunity. Previously, there was neither a trustworthy vessel to possess, nor a method to escape the suction of the Immortal Ruins. Thus, even if Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao had the intention, it could not implement it. But this time, with the existence of the chosen Saint Emperor, everything became different. Li Ping also completely handed over the control of the puppet body to Xuanhuang's Heavenly Dao. He himself merely acted as an observer, feeling and comprehending. Just this simple act was something almost impossible for any other cultivator in Xuanhuang Realm. Like a child who had been confined for a long time and saw a breathtaking view, Li Ping felt exhilaration, excitement, and anticipation from Xuanhuang's Heavenly Dao... And the deep dark starry sea became brighter and brighter. It might be an exaggeration to call it bright. It was merely occasional, scattered bursts of light. But in this originally dark and silent starry sea, they were so conspicuous. The puppet body seemed to vanish, and the perspective zoomed in exponentially. The center of the entire deep dark starry sea, not in a spatial sense but a vital sense, appeared before Li Ping. It was like a faintly beating heart, weak but undoubtedly representing life, hope, and the future. Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao and Li Ping arrived at the heart's foot. Greedily, they seized and absorbed the vital force of the starry sea that emanated outwards from the beats. Instantly, countless scenes surged into their minds. There were world destructions and the ebb and flow of the starry sea. There was the prosperity of living beings and the response of Heaven. There were also terrifying shadowy beings, like black mist, stealthily watching, ready to pounce at any moment. Amidst these countless complexities of change and constancy, the deep dark starry sea, after destruction, remained stable and persistent, attempting to burst forth with vitality again. This was indeed the fundamental Dao of this starry sea, but it was also a persistence that could bring tears to one's eyes. Unable to bear the immense and pure Origin Dao intent of the entire deep dark starry sea, the puppet body began to disintegrate inch by inch. However, Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's consciousness and Saint Emperor Li Ping, at this moment, were carefree and fearless. "Compared to the entire deep dark starry sea, what is the tribulation that Xuanhuang Realm suffered?" "The starry sea can recover from destruction, and so can Xuanhuang Realm." The two, during their last opportunity, tried to engrave as many insights as possible. Li Ping also knew that the Origin Dao intent of the deep dark starry sea was not something he could currently comprehend. The current comprehension was more like a blind man touching an elephant. All that he saw and comprehended was merely a tiny fraction that he himself wanted to see and could feel. However, even this tiny part, insignificant to the entire starry sea, was of great significance to them. Just as the puppet body was about to completely disintegrate and vanish, the nascent revival consciousness of the starry sea seemed to have sensed the presence of Li Ping and Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. It cast a glance of attention. But it was clear that the fragile puppet body was utterly incapable of withstanding this immense power. It was annihilated in the boundless power. However, before its consciousness disappeared, Li Ping, through Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, saw a blurry image that appeared and vanished in an instant. Li Ping couldn't be sure if it was an illusion. Immortal Dao perished, the starry sea was destroyed, and calamities spread. A figure, whose face and details were indistinct, gradually faded. It completely disappeared. Only his light laughter echoed in the starry sea where calamities were about to spread. "What does it have to do with me..." "What does it have to do with me..." "Hahahaha..." Boom! The Saint Emperor suddenly returned to reality. With a muffled groan, he spat out a mouthful of golden blood. The sleeping Cat Treasure suddenly lifted its head and with lightning speed flew to the still-floating blood. It directly swallowed the blood into its belly. "Meow! Meow meow!" Afterward, as if fearing Li Ping's scolding, Cat Treasure purred appeasingly. Circulating his golden Origin Force, Li Ping slowly healed his internal injuries and did not bother with Cat Treasure. His thoughts were entirely focused on the scene he had just witnessed. "That figure..." The Saint Emperor's heart was filled with gravity. Someone who could make this starry sea, even after being destroyed and reborn, remember so vividly, must not be a simple character. Just lingering in his mind for a short while made the Saint Emperor feel a vague sense of danger. He was immediately startled and slowly forced himself to stop thinking about it. But soon, the Saint Emperor realized he was overthinking. Because even without his conscious effort to forget, the memories of that figure were slowly fading uncontrollably. "This situation..." "It's not yet the legendary state of a 'Nameless True Immortal,' but it seems only one step away." The Saint Emperor savored the meaning that the newborn starry sea was trying to convey at that moment. "If I'm not mistaken, the culprit behind the rampant calamities in the starry sea is likely this person..." The Saint Emperor frowned slightly, trying desperately to capture the vanishing memory in his mind. Finally, all the details slowly faded. Only the four words "What does it have to do with me" remained. "He Gan Immortal." The Saint Emperor's expression was unreadable. Li Ping sat in the Saint Emperor's Throne for a long time, silent. Meanwhile, Cat Treasure also seemed to sense something, lowering its body and looking around, adopting a hunting posture. It seemed to be searching for an existence that made Li Ping extremely wary. But in the end, it found nothing. Cat Treasure became lazy again and fell asleep on Li Ping's shoulder. The Saint Emperor, however, began to digest the gains from his journey into the depths of the starry sea. It wasn't just him. Even Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao began to undergo changes after this trip, changes that had not occurred for a long time. Like the newborn deep dark starry sea, it was subtle and unknown to others. But it was indeed happening. Only a handful of people in the world could sense it. Great Qi. The Stone Tablet, chatting with someone in a teahouse in the Sacred Capital City, changed its expression and looked into the distance. In the Jianren Shou space, Ruo Mu, who was trimming its withered branches, stared blankly at the new sprouts growing on its withered branches, utterly astonished. Miles underground, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree only felt the surging power of Xuanhuang Realm's currents becoming increasingly vigorous without any warning, as if something was brewing, filling it with both anticipation and dread. ... "On the banks of the sunken boat, a thousand sails pass; before the ill tree, ten thousand trees greet the spring." In the Derivation Law Jade space, Li Fan's heart suddenly surged with these two lines of poetry. "So, it turns out that comprehending the Dao in the starry sea with the help of Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao yields the greatest rewards." "Because the perspective of a person and the perspective of Heaven and Earth are different." "Just like back then, when I used the Canghai Pearl to understand the 'Formless Killing Intent.'" "Creating the Saint Emperor clone in this life and assisting Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was truly a fortunate coincidence." Li Fan was overjoyed inwardly. Although his connection with the Saint Emperor had become very weak, due to the immense impact of the starry sea's Origin Dao intent, he had gained some understanding of the Saint Emperor's and Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's insights. The most crucial thing was that he had grasped the method. As long as he had the method, in the next life, he could recreate it.</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The origin Dao intent of the Star Sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping savored the insights transmitted by the Faceless Saint Emperor, replaying them in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, he vaguely sensed the Xuanhuang Realm's revival, a process unfolding from within and extending outwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If there were no cultivators of new techniques who devoured the heavens and swallowed the earth within, and no Immortal Ruins without, perhaps the Xuanhuang Realm could truly be reborn."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alas... this is a cure that fails to address the root cause."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he shook his head slightly, a flicker of doubt surfaced in his mind. Logically, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao couldn't possibly be unaware of this. Instead of accumulating this power of revival for a future decisive battle, it was eagerly manifesting it now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What was the purpose behind this?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heh heh, let me wait and see."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The perspective shifted back to the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet, upon sensing the anomaly in the Xuanhuang Realm, immediately arrived at the Faceless Saint Emperor's throne. Seeing the Saint Emperor, whose body also emanated an arcane aura, the Stone Tablet was startled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You already know about what happened in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's no need to panic. It's beneficial, not detrimental," the Saint Emperor replied.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet's expression eased slightly. "I had thought the Xuanhuang Realm was facing imminent disaster, going through a final burst of life before its demise..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What you said isn't entirely wrong. This surge of revitalizing power, born from a moment of enlightenment, is indeed not meant to last. However, for us, this might be an unprecedented opportunity." After a brief silence, the Saint Emperor spoke slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You mean the plan for establishing the Xuanhuang Orthodox lineage?" The Stone Tablet was slightly taken aback, then quickly understood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor nodded, and a miniature projection of the Xuanhuang Realm appeared before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within it was the original portion of the Xuanhuang Realm, depicted in a glowing yellow hue.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And since the collapse of the Immortal Path, the territories and worlds captured by the Xuanhuang native powers, the Xuanhuang Sect, and the Ten Immortal Sects using the 'Grand Formation for Traversing the Starry Sea' were depicted in a strange green.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After the great calamity spread and the Star Sea was shattered, the remnants of other cultivation worlds forcibly stitched together by outsiders were shown in a desolate black.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was information transmitted from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It could be seen that the yellow color occupied less than a thirtieth of the entire miniature landscape of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The green color occupied a tenth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the remainder, it was all vast swathes of black.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Visually, the Xuanhuang's yellow appeared to be the anomaly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But unlike the green and black colors, the glowing yellow representing the Xuanhuang Realm seemed to possess a life of its own, flickering and constantly overflowing into the surrounding alien colored regions, spreading outwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From a direct visual perspective, the green and black regions were not pure.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They were interspersed with specks of dark yellow.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, over the past few thousand years, this erosion, in a sense, had slowed down, even showing signs of reversal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With the recent sudden resurgence of vitality in the Xuanhuang Realm, the outward spread of the Xuanhuang's yellow hue had unexpectedly accelerated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Orthodox lineage..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet pondered, "The regions that originally belonged to the Xuanhuang Realm are naturally beyond question. All events that occurred within them are meticulously recorded by the Creation Stone Tablet. As for those green regions..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet carefully identified them. "Some fall within the scope of the Stone Tablet's records, while others do not."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for those black regions, they are pure blind spots."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Emperor Li Ping, the Saint Emperor, spoke, "If we do nothing, the ultimate fate of the Xuanhuang Realm will be to be swallowed by the black regions, which hold an overwhelming numerical advantage. In the future, this blackness will likely evolve into something else entirely."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, we must act first and deeply infuse the Xuanhuang Orthodox lineage into these external remnants."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's voice was low, but his determination was evident.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How do we do it?" The Stone Tablet's interest was piqued.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Observe the Dao of Heaven, execute the actions of Heaven..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor spoke slowly, and the Stone Tablet listened carefully, occasionally nodding.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After explaining the method in detail, the Saint Emperor's tone became somewhat solemn. "When doing this, you must be cautious and discreet, lest the instigator discover your actions."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the Saint Emperor did not explicitly name who the instigator was, the Stone Tablet understood his meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Rarely, the Stone Tablet revealed a playful smile. "As the saying goes, 'subtle influence.' This method is so secretive, and with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao actively cooperating and concealing, even if that person possesses peerless cultivation, I doubt they can detect it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor spoke sternly, "Do not be careless. Even if they are not currently in the Xuanhuang Realm, we must guard against their residual plans."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet nodded, indicating understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"For this matter, the fewer participants, the better. This task should have been handled by Ruo Mu for maximum efficiency. After all, as a primordial tree spirit, its connection to the Xuanhuang Realm is far closer."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not that I don't trust him, but Ruo Mu's every move is closely watched by other powerful beings in this realm. As an operative, being too conspicuous would be detrimental. Conversely, if everyone believes you are constantly oppressed by the Creation Stone Tablet, they would naturally overlook you." Perhaps due to the future of the Xuanhuang Realm being at stake, the Saint Emperor spoke with rare verbosity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if he were speaking to the Stone Tablet, or perhaps to Ruo Mu.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is what they call 'hiding in plain sight,' isn't it?" The Stone Tablet agreed, nodding. "Now that I am free from the Stone Tablet's burden, and with a few more transformations, I guarantee that no one in the Xuanhuang Realm will associate me with my former appearance."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then let us wait a few more days, until the Xuanhuang's current surge of revitalizing power reaches its peak, and then act. This will allow us to achieve twice the results with half the effort."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet immediately agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It did not leave but quietly stood in the main hall of the Saint Emperor's throne, observing the miniature Xuanhuang Realm projected by the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The light in the center of the Xuanhuang pulsed, like a beating heart, transporting wisps of Xuanhuang essence to all corners of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the green and black regions were gradually showing signs of assimilation. However, with the continuous powerful surge of revitalizing force, they could temporarily maintain their original colors. Slowly, at last, even the darkest regions at the outermost periphery of the Xuanhuang Realm were stained with an imperceptible trace of Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We can act now." The Faceless Saint Emperor said in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet smiled slightly, its form flickering, instantly differentiating into two identical clones within the Saint Emperor's throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then two became four, four became eight, and eight multiplied to sixteen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the blink of an eye, countless identical Stone Tablet figures filled the hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Transform! Transform! Transform!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablets chanted in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, the Stone Tablet clones transformed into various forms of living beings from the Xuanhuang Realm &ndash; scholars in elegant white robes, hunched woodcutters, peerlessly beautiful women, nonchalant old men...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Each individual appeared incredibly lifelike, with no trace of being derived from the same being.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I shall depart," they said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Each of them bowed to the Saint Emperor with a smile, and their figures vanished from the Saint Emperor's throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Simultaneously, across various prefectures of the Xuanhuang Realm, unnoticed by anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Special existences appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When they were all gathered in the Saint Emperor's throne, it had seemed rather crowded. But once dispersed throughout the Xuanhuang Realm, they would not cause the slightest disturbance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Observe the Dao of Heaven, execute the actions of Heaven."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heaven and Man unite, all transformations are based on this foundation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They chanted softly, their feet heading towards the mortal gathering cities in each prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's plan, though seemingly simple, was in essence: to establish the foundation of Heaven through human intent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Utilizing the Stone Tablet's ability to disguise itself as any form, countless clones were dispatched to infiltrate the mortal populace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They would subtly propagate the existence of the "Xuanhuang Realm" to all mortal beings in the Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, mortals only knew the small corner of the land where they resided. They had no specific recognition of this world, the Xuanhuang Realm. The very concept of the Xuanhuang Realm did not exist in their consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The first step in establishing the Xuanhuang Orthodox lineage was to first instill in them the awareness of their existence within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, this was not a task that could be accomplished in a single day; it would require years, perhaps even decades, of diligent propagation through word of mouth, integrating seamlessly into mortal communities to avoid detection.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, with the Stone Tablet's power, even with countless clones, achieving this was not an insurmountable challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A single mortal was like an ant, hence a hundred, a thousand. But when all the mortals of the Xuanhuang Realm were united, they would form an undeniable force.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once the mortal population of the Xuanhuang Realm reached a consensus, the second stage of the plan could commence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Using the intent of 'All Beings of Heaven and Earth,' they would launch a synchronized counterattack against the lingering consciousness of the foreign cultivation remnants, encircling and devouring them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This step would require the assistance of Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As an existence akin to a world spirit, he possessed profound knowledge of how to devour world consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After coordinating with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao to annihilate the cultivation remnants, the final step would be to help these remnants fully integrate into the Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, most regions of the Xuanhuang Realm had already completed superficial integration.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a few isolated prefectures, due to improper integration, were still prone to strange anomalies.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These 'ulcers and sores' needed thorough surgical removal and reconstruction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If the first and second steps could be carried out covertly, then the third step would undoubtedly alert the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and potentially even the Law Transmitter from beyond the stars.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At that point, conflict would be unavoidable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, according to the Saint Emperor's plan, even if they failed in the second step, the momentum would have been established, and failure would be absolute.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unless more cultivation remnants were found, and another ten thousand years were spent to undertake another round of dissection and reconstruction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet, which had not been this excited about anything for a long time, felt a surge of passion for the Saint Emperor's plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Beyond saving the Xuanhuang Realm, if successful, the benefits would be self-evident.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It would gain greater control over the world's fate, becoming an existence even more powerful than longevity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of the reason, the Stone Tablet would not refuse this plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten years would pass in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Saint Emperor's throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping summoned Ruo Mu.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A true wise individual never placed all their eggs in one basket.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He naturally would not entrust such a critical task as establishing the Xuanhuang Orthodox lineage solely to the Stone Tablet.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the Stone Tablet was trustworthy, and the plan had low risk.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He expressed the same sentiment as he had to the Stone Tablet, albeit in different words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The primary agent, Ruo Mu, would be responsible for the task, while the 'All Beings of Heaven and Earth' concept, to be instilled into the Xuanhuang Realm, would be achieved through the ordinary flora and fauna of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You are the ancestor of all beings, so influencing them subtly should be something you can accomplish."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Establish the concept of the 'Xuanhuang Realm.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For Ruo Mu, this was a minor task.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, the recent development of new sprouts on its withered branches had renewed its spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Rarely motivated, it readily agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ruo Mu, Stone Tablet."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Having only them is not enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ultimately, I will have to personally intervene."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With triple insurance, only then can it be considered foolproof."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's thoughts flowed slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Contending with the Myriad Immortals Alliance head-on is the manifest battlefield."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And this establishment of the Xuanhuang Orthodox lineage is the war fought in the shadows."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Comparatively speaking, this shadow war is even more crucial. There is only one chance; if lost, it is a complete defeat."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While the Saint Emperor was contemplating, his forehead slowly bulged.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the flesh and blood swelled, a tumor continuously grew larger.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping seemed completely unaware, remaining motionless.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Until half a day later, the flesh and blood burst open, and a mass of Xuanhuang aura emerged.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Xuanhuang aura swirled, with a hazy image within.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed somewhat like Mr. Bai, and somewhat like Li Ping himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Cat Treasure."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Faceless Saint Emperor called out to the dozing Cat Treasure.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He pinched its nape, coaxing it reluctantly to activate its replication ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Another identical mass of Xuanhuang aura appeared in the Saint Emperor's throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Go!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor gave a soft command, and these two masses of Xuanhuang aura pierced through the void, leaving the Great Qi small world and flying towards different prefectures of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They did not directly merge with the Heavenly Dao but instead lurked in the shadows.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor coughed lightly. Even with his strength, he felt a slight, temporary weakness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The mass of Xuanhuang aura that separated from his body could, in a sense, be considered the remnants of the Xuanhuang malevolence he had previously consumed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, after being refined by himself, and imbued with the Sacred Dynasty's destiny from the 'Heavenly Emperor's Manual of Qi,' it had become something akin to a tangible manifestation of Xuanhuang destiny.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If not for his recent deep dive into the Star Sea and his observation of the Star Sea's origin intent, it would have been difficult for him to condense this tangible destiny.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Each mass of tangible destiny can be integrated into, and govern, approximately three prefectures."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's set aside the Five Elders Council for now. With Cat Treasure's assistance, it shouldn't take long to encompass the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A few breaths later, the Saint Emperor's aura had returned to its peak strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Ping knew this was due to the support of the Sacred Dynasty's destiny reserves and the feedback from his own enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If he condensed this too frequently, he would not recover so quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The integration of Xuanhuang destiny into Heaven and Earth is equivalent to a reassertion of sovereignty."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if Ruo Mu and the Stone Tablet fail, the Xuanhuang Orthodox lineage will still be firmly under control."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, it would be even better if they succeeded."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In Li Ping's estimations, the war against the Myriad Immortals Alliance should ideally occur after the establishment of the Xuanhuang Orthodox lineage.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because by then, in dealing with these 'heretics' of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, he would effectively be fighting on home turf. Every thought and every intention could disregard spatial distance and summon the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao to unleash endless heavenly punishment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Victory would be achieved without a single soldier.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-275" class="calibre1">Chapter 1264: Boundless Peeking and World Shattering</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the cultivation world, the strong reign supreme. The ultimate outcome would depend on the final battle with the Law Transmitter. The Saint Emperor, self-aware of his current limitations, understood that a significant gap remained between his strength and that of the Law Transmitter. After all, the latter had suppressed the Xuanhuang Realm for millennia and had further honed his understanding in the depths of the starry sea, making him truly unfathomable. While the Saint Emperor had reached the Xuanhuang Realm's limits and gained the fortuitous encounter with the Star Sea's Origin Dao intent, he had yet to fully translate this into tangible power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I need more time," the Saint Emperor thought, a sense of urgency gripping him. "Time waits for no one." Before his journey to the starry sea, he hadn't felt this way. But since his return, an inexplicable intuition told him that his time might be running out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Sun family. Sun Luyuan, channeling his spiritual energy to ward off the biting cold, slowly stepped into the room. He looked at Sun Tianci, who sat cross-legged on the bed, not crying or making noise, but simply staring blankly, a wave of helplessness washing over him. Every family has its own burdens. Outsiders only knew of Sun Tianci's extraordinary birth, seemingly born in harmony with the Dao and possessing immense power, but they didn't know that perhaps, having witnessed his mother's death firsthand from birth, the child had become extremely indifferent to outsiders. A natural aura of frigid defense emanated from him, making it difficult for others to approach. If not for his innate Dao-integration cultivation, he might not have survived even a few days without proper care. However, no matter how extraordinary, he was still a newborn infant who required care. The several Dao integration cultivators of the Sun family could only take turns attending to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Tianci..." Sun Luyuan offered a gentle smile, presenting the prepared premium spiritual liquid. "Please have some, won't you?" Sun Tianci merely shook his head, refusing. Sun Luyuan felt helpless. Then, as if struck by an idea, he spoke softly, "I'm going to visit your father this time. He learned of your birth and personally created a cultivation method for you. Take a look..." With that, Sun Luyuan transmitted Li Ping's "Righteous Law Ascendant" technique to Sun Tianci via divine sense. Upon hearing that it was created by his unseen father for his sake, the icy aura surrounding Sun Tianci showed a slight loosening. He slowly read through the text of "Righteous Law Ascendant," seeming to gain some insight, and closed his eyes. Sensing the environment around him gradually returning to normal, Sun Luyuan was overjoyed. More importantly, Sun Tianci's innate sense of sorrow was also slowly receding.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What a truly 'Righteous Law Ascendant'!" "Our Lu is indeed resourceful!" Knowing that Sun Tianci was currently in a state of enlightenment, Sun Luyuan dared not disturb him. He gently placed the spiritual liquid aside and quietly withdrew. After sealing the room with restrictions to prevent any external disturbances, he finally felt somewhat at ease. "Tianci's temperament is good as well. If he stays indoors and out of public view, in a few years, the world will forget his existence." "In this era of great change, our Sun family should prioritize dormancy and preserving our strength."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking this, Sun Luyuan recalled the mission assigned to him by the Sacred Dynasty. Since joining the Sacred Dynasty, his life had been quite leisurely, with no mandatory tasks assigned. His previous plan to lure Kongyou Immortal to the Sacred Dynasty to become a Dao companion for the Saint Emperor's disciples had been interrupted by Xuanyuan Xian's sudden commission and was now uncontactable, so it had to be set aside for the time being. This left Sun Luyuan, who was eager to contribute and increase his own capital, somewhat dejected. He had finally received a task from the Sacred Dynasty, but it was quite troublesome, and he hadn't found an opportunity to act. "The Nether Prison..." "Isn't that just a place to imprison heinous criminals? What is the Sacred Dynasty trying to achieve by meddling in it?" Sun Luyuan muttered to himself. Entering the Nether Prison wouldn't be difficult, but infiltrating it while maintaining contact with the outside world would be truly challenging. "The Nether Prison operates as a separate entity within the Myriad Immortals Alliance, exclusively managed in rotation by the Law Transmitters. To interfere..." Although the mission assigned by the Sacred Dynasty didn't specify consequences for failure, Sun Luyuan knew this was undoubtedly a test from the Sacred Dynasty. Sun Luyuan's mind conjured images of various individuals, beginning to contemplate a list of people who could assist him in this matter. After a long while, he still found no promising candidates. Habitually, he went to the underground secret chamber. His younger brother, Sun Luoyao, the spirit of the Boundless Mirror, seeing his expression, inquired about the reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother, I found some information that might be useful." Sun Luyuan's tightly furrowed brows relaxed as he looked at the message his brother had sent. "Perhaps it's feasible." "I'll go try." As he was about to leave in a hurry, he suddenly heard Sun Luoyao ask, "Oh, right, Brother, you promised to take me out for some fresh air before. When can we set off?" Sun Luyuan paused, responding vaguely, "Wait a bit longer. Those people are still watching the Sun family. If I take you out now, who knows if the situation like last time, being ambushed by the Medicine Hall's Chen family while searching for fragments, will happen again." "Let's wait until the situation calms down." With that, he left in a hurry before Sun Luoyao could respond.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Okay, I understand, Brother..." Before he left, he heard his brother say. However, his tone seemed a bit strange. But Sun Luyuan didn't think much of it. Sun Luoyao's information, obtained by peering through the Heavenly Profound Mirror, indicated that the Myriad Immortals Alliance had a high-ranking prisoner who was about to be sent to the Nether Prison. However, this individual had a special status, being a direct descendant of the Law Transmitter [Sun]. With such a background, he shouldn't have been sent to a place like the Nether Prison. But the crime he committed openly this time was simply too grave. As is widely known, the Myriad Immortals Alliance was organizing the second "Rainbow Light Escape" towards the depths of the starry sea. Kongming Liujing was a critical resource required for this endeavor. While previously the Myriad Immortals Alliance had tacitly agreed to distribute the slots for this "Rainbow Light Escape" equally among Dao integration cultivators of the Alliance, regardless of background, they had now used this opportunity to publicly reiterate the scarcity of Kongming Liujing under the guise of righteousness. They began to employ methods, including but not limited to fishing expeditions, to reclaim the Liujing privately hoarded by various families. And that direct descendant of the Law Transmitter, Sun Wanyun, was caught red-handed for privately purchasing large quantities of Kongming Liujing. The cultivators responsible for apprehending him were naturally aware of Sun Wanyun's identity. But in full view of the public, they had to maintain appearances. Thus, they could only grudgingly arrest him. They had originally intended to release him quietly afterward, but for some unknown reason, someone had been fanning the flames from behind the scenes. In less than half a day, the news of Sun Wanyun's relentless and uncompromising arrest by the Myriad Immortals Alliance had quietly spread. Everyone praised Law Transmitter Sun for upholding the Alliance's laws and sacrificing his own kin. With the situation having escalated to this point, the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not possibly backtrack on its decision. Moreover, Kongming Liujing was indeed too important, so Sun Wanyun was rightfully imprisoned in the Nether Prison. However, being a direct descendant of a Law Transmitter, no one knew when he might be released. Therefore, he naturally had certain privileges within the Nether Prison.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This person should be a suitable breakthrough point." "Under the guise of visiting, I can deliver the item gifted by the Saint Emperor to him..." Sun Luyuan thought this and arrived at the temporary detention location for Sun Wanyun within the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters. Upon seeing the scene, he was somewhat stunned. It turned out that quite a few "wise people" understood the principle of sending charcoal in the snow. A crowd of cultivators had gathered at the entrance to visit him, making it quite lively. It was hardly the treatment one would expect for a major criminal about to be imprisoned in the Nether Prison. This scene was truly ironic. Although they shared the same surname, Sun Luyuan had no blood relation to Law Transmitter Sun or this Sun Wanyun, having only met them a few times. As the patriarch of the Sun family, boasting five Dao integration cultivators, who appeared incredibly glorious to outsiders, Sun Luyuan also had to obediently wait in line at the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Simultaneously, in the Sun family's underground secret chamber. Li Fan's divine sense clone was mercilessly mocking Sun Luoyao. "I told you long ago that your brother would never let you out. What do you think?" "I took you out before because you would occasionally lose control and were constantly at risk of the Boundless Mirror malfunctioning." "Now, with my help and careful management, the source of the Boundless Mirror's instability, that obliterating wind tribulation, has been gradually dispelled, and your performance has become increasingly stable." "You, young man, are now an immortal artifact, and you are the hope for the Sun family's rise. How could your brother possibly let you go easily? What if something were to happen to you, and you were abducted?" Sun Luoyao listened to Li Fan's taunts in silence, his figure in the mirror occasionally distorting, revealing his inner indignation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior..." After a long period of silence, he wisely spoke, seeking help from Li Fan. Sun Luoyao knew that this mysterious entity would not have spoken so much just to mock him. "Heh heh. You've become smarter, kid." Li Fan chuckled. As he spoke, he conjured a pair of large hands and reached for Sun Luoyao's head. Sun Luoyao was startled but endured it and did not dodge. The dark giant hand enveloped him, and the Boundless Mirror within violently shook. A phantom image was extracted by Li Fan from Sun Luoyao's body. Li Fan gently waved his hand, and this phantom image floated out of the Boundless Mirror, merging with a pile of materials that had appeared out of thin air in the secret chamber. In a short while, another "Boundless Mirror," appearing identical to the original, materialized before Sun Luoyao. As the spirit of the Boundless Mirror, Sun Luoyao was naturally extremely familiar with the immortal artifact. But even he could not distinguish the difference between the current object and the immortal artifact he inhabited! His heart filled with doubt, Sun Luoyao flew into the fake mirror, only to find it was an empty shell. He then excitedly returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior's methods are indeed unfathomable! You can even replicate immortal artifacts, and so realistically!" Sun Luoyao flattered. "Hmph, it's merely a superficial imitation," Li Fan said coldly. "You should project another strand of your divine sense into this mirror. With my craftsmanship as the foundation, and your augmentation, it should be enough to fool your brother." Seeing freedom within reach, Sun Luoyao did not hesitate. Enduring the agonizing pain of his soul being severed, he separated a strand of divine sense. Once Sun Luoyao's divine sense entered the imitation Boundless Mirror, this counterfeit artifact became flawless. In a sense, it could be considered a clone of the true Boundless Mirror. Although it was just an empty shell, as long as the Boundless Mirror existed, it could synchronize the information detected by the main body at any time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, can we sneak out now?" Seeing the imitation Boundless Mirror now floating quietly in the air, replacing the original, Sun Luoyao asked impatiently. "Idiot! What do you mean 'sneak out'?" "This is called 'the vast sea allows fish to leap, the high heavens let birds fly'!" Li Fan's clone laughed sinisterly, grabbing the Boundless Mirror and transforming into a black streak, ignoring the heavy restrictions and defenses personally laid out by Sun Luyuan, and instantly exited the Sun family. Seeing the blue sky above again, Sun Luoyao was filled with excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, where are we going?" "As discussed before, to find the lost immortal artifacts of the Xuanhuang Realm?" Even without a physical body, Sun Luoyao deeply inhaled the air of freedom and cautiously asked Li Fan. "Immortal artifacts... no rush," Li Fan merely replied. Seeing that the other party wouldn't elaborate, Sun Luoyao dared not press further. He could only be led by the other party, speeding south towards the Xuanhuang Realm. Seven days later, sensing the surging energy fluctuations ahead, Sun Luoyao suddenly became alert.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That is..." In the boundless ocean, turbulent currents converged towards a central point. Fierce winds howled and crackled. The torrential rain even tore through space, giving rise to streaks of lightning. Beside the immense vortex, which seemed to gather all the water in the world, lay a striking chain of islands, resembling a long dragon. This distinctive scenery immediately told Sun Luoyao where they were. "The Realm-Splitting Great Vortex!" he exclaimed. Although he had already known of this magnificent natural spectacle from countless documents gleaned through the Heavenly Profound Mirror, the experience of being there in person was vastly different.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Such surging, turbulent currents, such ferocious, violent winds..." "How could mere informational shadows represent even a fraction of it?" From his youth, confined to a dark, sunless mirror, unable to witness the magnificent sights of the world. This grand and magnificent scene before him stirred Sun Luoyao's emotions, making him feel like the passionate youth he once was. "Making such a racket, you truly have no experience," Li Fan's discordant voice pulled Sun Luoyao out of his continuous exclamations. "After your sighing, it's time to get down to business." With a gentle flick of his finger towards the Boundless Mirror, Sun Luoyao's phantom image was instantly sucked into it. A moment later, the mirror's surface uncontrollably released a beam of ethereal light, aimed at the nearby Realm-Splitting Great Vortex. The Boundless Mirror's body trembled slightly, and countless images cascaded within it like a waterfall. Li Fan simply narrowed his eyes, quietly awaiting the changes within.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Boundless, the primordial realm meets the square." "With this grand formation as its core, the Boundless Mirror should be able to decipher all secrets in the world." "Although it is now damaged, it should be sufficient to spy on the secrets of this [Realm-Splitting]." "After all, the power of Realm-Splitting back then was immense. Even after so much time, the wounds it left on the Xuanhuang Realm have yet to heal." ... As Li Fan contemplated, the Boundless Mirror seemed to have reached its limit. Cracks began to appear on its surface. (End of this chapter)</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-276" class="calibre1">Chapter 1265: Prolegomenon to Xuanhuang Island</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Origin Dao Intent of the Star Sea..." Li Fan repeatedly savored the fragments of insight transmitted from the Saint Emperor. Simultaneously, he vaguely sensed the ongoing resurgence of the Xuanhuang Realm from within. "If there were no Devouring Heaven and Earth cultivators within, and no Immortal Ruins from the outside, perhaps the Xuanhuang Realm could truly be reborn." "Unfortunately... it's destined to be a superficial fix." While shaking his head slightly, a trace of doubt surfaced in his mind. Logically, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao must have known this. Instead of accumulating this revival energy for the decisive battle ahead, it was eagerly manifesting it now. What was its purpose? "Heh heh, I shall wait and see."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The perspective shifted back to the Sacred Dynasty in Great Qi. The Stone Tablet, having sensed the anomaly in the Xuanhuang Realm, immediately arrived at the Saint Emperor's Throne. Upon seeing the Saint Emperor, who also emanated a mystical aura, the Stone Tablet was startled. "You are aware of what transpired in the Xuanhuang Realm?" "There is no cause for alarm; it is beneficial, not detrimental," the Saint Emperor replied. The Stone Tablet's expression eased slightly. "I thought the Xuanhuang Realm was on the brink of destruction, experiencing a final surge of vitality..." "You are not entirely wrong. This revival energy, triggered by a momentary enlightenment, is not meant to last. However, for us, it might represent a once-in-a-millennium opportunity," the Saint Emperor said slowly after a brief silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You mean the plan to establish the Xuanhuang's orthodox lineage?" the Stone Tablet paused, then quickly understood. "Indeed." The Saint Emperor nodded, and a miniature representation of the Xuanhuang Realm appeared before them. Within it, parts of the primal Xuanhuang Realm glowed yellow. However, since the collapse of the Immortal Path, the indigenous forces of the Xuanhuang Realm, the Xuan Heaven Cult, and the Ten Immortal Sects, in their capture of Cave-Heavens and Worlds using the [Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation], appeared in a peculiar green. After the great calamity swept through and the Star Sea shattered, the fragments of other cultivation worlds, forcibly grafted by outsiders, appeared in a deathly black.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This information was transmitted by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. It was evident that the yellow, representing the Xuanhuang Realm, occupied less than a third of the entire miniature landscape. Green constituted a tenth. The rest was vast expanses of black. Visually, the Xuanhuang's yellow seemed like an anomaly. However, unlike the green and black hues, the yellow light representing the Xuanhuang Realm pulsed as if possessing its own consciousness, constantly overflowing and spreading into the surrounding, alien-colored regions. From a purely visual perspective, the green and black areas were not pure, interspersed with specks of dark yellow. Yet, over millennia, this insidious erosion had slowed, even showing signs of being reversed. However... with the recent surge of vitality in the Xuanhuang Realm, the spread of the Xuanhuang color had suddenly accelerated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang's orthodox lineage..." the Stone Tablet mused. "The regions originally belonging to the Xuanhuang Realm are naturally beyond question; all events occurring within them are meticulously recorded by the Creation Stone Tablet. As for the green regions..." the Stone Tablet carefully discerned. "Some fall within the Stone Tablet's recorded scope, while others do not." "As for the black regions, they are complete blind spots."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping, the Saint Emperor, stated, "If we do nothing, the ultimate fate of the Xuanhuang Realm will be to be swallowed by the overwhelmingly dominant black. In the future, this blackness will likely evolve into something entirely different." "Therefore, we must act first and deeply infuse the Xuanhuang's orthodox lineage into these external remnants." The Saint Emperor's voice was deep but resolute.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How do we proceed?" the Stone Tablet asked with keen interest. "Observe the ways of Heaven, act according to Heaven..." the Saint Emperor slowly explained, and the Stone Tablet listened intently, nodding occasionally. After detailing the method, the Saint Emperor's tone grew somber. "Proceed with utmost caution when undertaking this, to avoid detection by the instigator." Although the Saint Emperor did not explicitly name the culprit, the Stone Tablet understood his meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Stone Tablet displayed a rare, playful smile. "This so-called 'silent nurturing,' carried out stealthily. With the active cooperation and concealment of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, even someone with peerless cultivation might not detect it." The Saint Emperor responded sternly, "Do not be careless. Even if they are not currently in the Xuanhuang Realm, we must guard against any contingencies they may have left behind." The Stone Tablet nodded, acknowledging this.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is best that the fewer people involved in this matter, the better. Ideally, Ruomu would be the most effective. After all, as a primordial tree spirit, his connection to the Xuanhuang Realm is more profound." "It's not that I don't trust him, but that every action Ruomu takes is under the observation of other powerful beings in this realm. As the executing party, he would be too conspicuous. Conversely, everyone believes you are constantly oppressed by the Creation Stone Tablet, which ironically makes you overlooked." Perhaps because it concerned the future of the Xuanhuang Realm, the Saint Emperor spoke at unusual length. It was as if he were speaking to the Stone Tablet, and also to Ruomu.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the so-called 'darkness beneath the lamp,' isn't it?" the Stone Tablet agreed, nodding. "Now that I am free from the burden of the Stone Tablet, and with a few more transformations, I can guarantee that no one in the Xuanhuang Realm will associate me with my past appearance." "Then let us wait a few days. When the Xuanhuang Realm's revived energy reaches its peak, we will act. It will be twice as effective with half the effort." The Stone Tablet immediately agreed. It did not leave but stood quietly in the Saint Emperor's Throne Hall, observing the miniature Xuanhuang Realm that the Saint Emperor had conjured.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The light in the center of the Xuanhuang pulsed, like a beating heart, transmitting tendrils of Xuanhuang essence to all parts of the Xuanhuang Realm, including the green and black regions. Although they were gradually being assimilated, the powerful, continuous surge of revival energy allowed them to temporarily maintain their original colors. Slowly, even the outermost black regions of the Xuanhuang Realm began to acquire a subtle, imperceptible trace of Xuanhuang-yellow.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We can begin now," the Faceless Saint Emperor said in a deep voice. The Stone Tablet smiled slightly, its form flickering. Instantly, within the Saint Emperor's Throne Hall, numerous identical Stone Tablet figures materialized. They transformed from two into four, four into eight, and eight into sixteen. In the blink of an eye, countless identical Stone Tablet figures filled the hall. "Change! Change! Change!" the Stone Tablets chanted in unison. In the next instant, the Stone Tablet duplicates transformed into various real beings of the Xuanhuang Realm: scholars in white robes, humble woodcutters, stunningly beautiful women, and carefree elders... Each person appeared incredibly lifelike, with no discernible resemblance to their origin, a single entity. "I depart," they bowed respectfully to the Saint Emperor, their faces beaming with smiles, and vanished from the Saint Emperor's Throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Simultaneously, across the various prefectures of the Xuanhuang Realm, in ways imperceptible to anyone, special presences emerged. When they had all gathered in the Saint Emperor's Throne Hall, they had seemed rather crowded. But dispersed throughout the Xuanhuang Realm, they caused not even the slightest ripple. "Observe the ways of Heaven, act according to Heaven." "Heaven and Man are one, all transformations are based on this foundation..." They chanted softly, their feet heading towards the densely populated mortal cities in each prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's plan was simple in concept. It was to establish the foundation of Heaven and Earth through human intent. Utilizing the Stone Tablet's ability to disguise itself as any form, countless duplicates were created, infiltrating the mortal populace. They would subtly propagate the concept of the "Xuanhuang Realm" to all mortal beings in the Xuanhuang Realm. Currently, mortals only knew the small corner of the world they inhabited. They had no specific understanding of this world, the Xuanhuang Realm. The very concept of the Xuanhuang Realm did not exist in their consciousness. The first step in establishing the Xuanhuang's orthodox lineage was to first popularize the existence of the Xuanhuang Realm, the world they lived in. Naturally, this was not a task for a single day, but would require years, perhaps even decades, of propagation. Moreover, to avoid raising suspicion, they needed to seamlessly integrate into mortal society, spreading the message through word of mouth. However, with the Stone Tablet's power, even with countless duplicates, achieving this was not insurmountable. A single mortal was as insignificant as an ant, but when combined with the entire mortal population of the Xuanhuang Realm, they formed an undeniable force.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once the mortal populace of the Xuanhuang Realm reached a consensus, the second phase of the plan would commence. Using the intent of "[All Beings of Heaven and Earth]," they would launch a synchronized counterattack and containment against the residual consciousness of the externally imposed cultivation realms, devouring them. This step would require Yin Shangren's assistance. As a being existing as a world-soul, he possessed profound knowledge of how to consume world consciousness. After cooperating with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao to purge the remnants of the cultivation realms, the final step would be to help these remnants fully integrate into the Xuanhuang Realm. In reality, the vast majority of the Xuanhuang Realm had already achieved superficial integration. Only a few prefectures experienced persistent anomalies due to improper fusion. These "ulcers" required surgical removal, a process of destruction and rebirth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While the first and second steps might be accomplished covertly, the third step would inevitably alert the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and possibly even the Law Transmitter from beyond the Star Sea. At that point, conflict would be unavoidable. However, according to the Saint Emperor, once the second step was completed, even if they ultimately failed, the tide would have turned, and it would be impossible to reverse the situation. It would require another ten thousand years of dismemberment and reintegration, incorporating more fragmented cultivation realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For the Saint Emperor's plan, the Stone Tablet, which had not been excited about any particular matter for a long time, felt a surge of fervor. Beyond saving the Xuanhuang Realm, the benefits of success were self-evident. They would gain greater control over the world's destiny, becoming beings even more powerful than those in the Longevity Realm. For whatever reason, the Stone Tablet would not refuse this plan. The ten-plus years required would pass in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">... In the Saint Emperor's Throne Hall. Li Ping summoned Ruomu. True wisdom lies in not placing all one's eggs in one basket. He naturally would not entrust such a critical task as establishing the Xuanhuang's orthodox lineage solely to the Stone Tablet. Even though the Stone Tablet was trustworthy and the plan carried minimal risk. He reiterated the same points he had made to the Stone Tablet, merely changing the wording. The primary agent responsible for achieving the goal would now be Ruomu. The concept of "Xuanhuang Realm" would be subtly implanted into the ordinary flora and fauna of the Xuanhuang Realm. "As the ancestor of all beings, you should be able to exert a subtle influence on them." "You must establish the idea of the [Xuanhuang Realm]." For Ruomu, this was a trivial matter. Furthermore, the recent event of new sprouts appearing on his withered branches had rekindled his spirit. Rare enthusiasm ignited, he readily agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ruomu, Stone Tablet." "Having them alone is not enough." "Ultimately, I must also personally intervene." "Triple insurance is the only way to guarantee success." The Saint Emperor's thoughts flowed, and as he contemplated, a bulge slowly formed on his forehead. Amidst the swelling flesh and blood, a tumor grew larger. Li Ping seemed completely oblivious, remaining motionless. After about half a day, the flesh and blood burst open, and a mass of Xuanhuang essence emerged. Surrounded by the Xuanhuang essence, hazy images flickered within. It looked somewhat like Mr. Bai, and somewhat like Li Ping himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Cat Treasure." The Faceless Saint Emperor called to the dozing Cat Treasure, rousing it. He gently squeezed its hindquarters, forcing the reluctant creature to perform its replication function. Then, another identical mass of Xuanhuang essence appeared in the Saint Emperor's Throne Hall. "Go!" The Saint Emperor commanded, and the two masses of Xuanhuang essence tore through space, leaving the Great Qi small world and heading towards different prefectures of the Xuanhuang Realm. They did not directly merge with the Heavenly Dao but instead lurked in secret. The Saint Emperor let out a slight cough. Even with his power, he felt a momentary, slight weakness. This mass of Xuanhuang essence, separated from him, could be considered, in a sense, the refined form of the Xuanhuang malevolence he had once consumed. However, after his own refinement, infused with the Sacred Dynasty's Qi Luck from the [Heavenly Emperor's Qi Canon], it had become something akin to materialized Xuanhuang Qi Luck. If not for his recent journey into the Star Sea and his encounter with the Star Sea's Origin Dao Intent, it would have been difficult for him to condense this materialized Qi Luck.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Each mass of materialized Qi Luck can merge with and govern approximately three prefectures." "Setting aside the Five Elders Council for now, encompassing the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance with Cat Treasure's assistance should not take long." A few breaths later, the Saint Emperor's aura returned to its peak. However, Li Ping knew this was due to the reserves of Sacred Dynasty Qi Luck and the feedback from his own enlightenment. If he condensed this essence too frequently, recovery would not be so rapid. "Integrating Xuanhuang Qi Luck into Heaven and Earth is akin to reasserting sovereignty." "Even if Ruomu and the Stone Tablet fail, the Xuanhuang's orthodox lineage will still be firmly established." Of course, it would be even better if they succeeded. According to Li Ping's calculations, the battle against the Myriad Immortals Alliance would ideally occur after the establishment of the Xuanhuang's orthodox lineage. Because by then, facing the Myriad Immortals Alliance's "heretics," he would essentially be fighting on home turf, able to mobilize the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao and unleash endless heavenly tribulations with every thought, regardless of spatial distance. Victory could be achieved without a single soldier.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-277" class="calibre1">Chapter 1266: Stealing Dark Power</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Naturally, in the cultivation world, strength reigned supreme. The key still lay in the final battle against the Law Transmitter. "Knowing oneself is wisdom." The Saint Emperor was acutely aware of the significant gap between his current strength and that of the Law Transmitter. After all, the latter had dominated the Xuanhuang for millennia and had also attained enlightenment in the depths of the Star Sea. Truly unfathomable. While the Saint Emperor had now reached the Xuanhuang Realm's limit and gained the fortuitous encounter with the Star Sea's Origin Dao Intent, he had yet to truly convert this fortune into power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I need more time." A sense of urgency settled upon the Saint Emperor. "Time waits for no one." Before his journey into the Star Sea, he hadn't felt this way. But since his return, an ethereal premonition told him that his time might be running out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sun family.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan channeled his spiritual energy, resisting the biting cold that permeated his surroundings, and slowly entered the room. He looked at Sun Tianci, who sat cross-legged on the bed, neither crying nor making noise, merely staring blankly. A sense of helplessness washed over him. Every family has its own difficult burdens. Outsiders knew Sun Tianci as a prodigy born with Dao comprehension, possessing extraordinary power. What they didn't know was that this child, having witnessed his birth mother's death from the moment he was born, had become extremely detached from others. A natural aura of frigid defense surrounded him, making it difficult for outsiders to approach. If not for his innate Harmonious Dao cultivation, he might have starved to death within days due to lack of care.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But no matter how extraordinary, he was still an infant who needed care. The Harmonious Dao cultivators of the Sun family could only take turns attending to him. "Tianci..." Sun Luyuan smiled kindly and produced the perfectly prepared high-grade spiritual fluid. "Won't you eat something?" Sun Tianci merely shook his head, refusing. Sun Luyuan felt a pang of helplessness. Then, as if remembering something, he gently said, "I'm going to visit your father this time. He learned of your birth and personally created a technique for you. See..." As he spoke, Sun Luyuan transmitted the text of [Righteous Law Ascending], created by Li Fan, into Sun Tianci's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing that it was a technique created by his father, whom he had never met, the icy aura surrounding Sun Tianci loosened slightly. He slowly read through the text of [Righteous Law Ascending], and as if suddenly enlightened, closed his eyes. Noticing the surrounding environment gradually normalizing, Sun Luyuan was overjoyed. More importantly, Sun Tianci's innate sadness seemed to be dissipating. "What a remarkable [Righteous Law Ascending]!" "Only Lu'er knows how to handle this!" Knowing that Sun Tianci was in a state of enlightenment, Sun Luyuan dared not disturb him. He gently placed the spiritual fluid aside and quietly withdrew. After sealing the room with a formation to prevent external disturbance, he felt somewhat at ease.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Tianci's disposition is for the best. By staying secluded and out of the public eye, people will forget his existence within a few years." "In this time of great change, our Sun family should prioritize hibernation and preserving our strength." With that thought, Sun Luyuan recalled the mission assigned to him by the Sacred Dynasty. Since joining the Sacred Dynasty, he had lived a rather leisurely life. The Sacred Dynasty had never imposed any mandatory tasks on him. Previously, his plan to lure Fairy Kongyou to the Sacred Dynasty to become a Dao companion for the Saint Emperor's disciples had been interrupted by Xuanyuan Xian's sudden commission, and he could no longer contact the other party, so it had to be temporarily shelved. This left Sun Luyuan, who had always sought to contribute and increase his capital, feeling somewhat frustrated. He had finally received a task from the Sacred Dynasty, but it was indeed troublesome, and he hadn't found an opportunity to act on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Abyssal Prison..." "Isn't that just a place to imprison major offenders? What does the Sacred Dynasty want with it?" Sun Luyuan muttered to himself. Entering the Abyssal Prison would not be difficult. However, to infiltrate it and maintain contact with the outside world would truly be challenging. "The Abyssal Prison operates as a separate entity within the Myriad Immortals Alliance, successively managed by the Law Transmitters. To interfere..." Although the task issued by the Sacred Dynasty this time carried no explicit consequences for failure, Sun Luyuan knew it was undoubtedly a test from the Sacred Dynasty. Sun Luyuan's mind raced, recalling faces, and he began to consider a list of individuals who might assist him with this matter. After a long while, he still had no promising prospects. Habitually, he headed to the underground secret chamber.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His younger brother, Sun Luoyao, the spirit of the Immeasurable Mirror, saw his expression and involuntarily inquired about the reason. "Brother, I've found some information that might be useful." Sun Luyuan looked at the information transmitted by his brother, and his tightly furrowed brow slowly relaxed. "Perhaps this is feasible." "I'll go try." With great haste, he prepared to depart, but then he heard Sun Luoyao ask, "Oh, right. Brother, you promised to take me out for some fresh air. When can we leave?" Sun Luyuan's steps faltered, and he responded evasively, "A little longer. The Sun family is still under scrutiny by those people right now. If I take you out now, we might encounter situations similar to the last time we were ambushed by the Chen family of the Medicine Hall while searching for fragments." "Let's wait until the storm passes." Having said that, he left in a hurry, without waiting for Sun Luoyao's reply.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Okay, I understand, Brother..." Before leaving, he heard his younger brother say this. However, his tone seemed somewhat unusual. But Sun Luyuan didn't think much of it. The information Sun Luoyao had gleaned from the Profound Heaven Mirror indicated that a major offender from the Myriad Immortals Alliance was about to be imprisoned in the Abyssal Prison. However, this person's identity was special; he was a direct descendant of the Law Transmitter [Sun]. With such a background, he shouldn't have been sent to a place like the Abyssal Prison in the first place. But the offense he had committed publicly this time was too significant.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As is widely known, the Myriad Immortals Alliance was organizing a second expedition of Rainbow Light to the depths of the Star Sea. Empty Light Flowing Crystal was a crucial material required for this endeavor. The previous tacit agreement to distribute spots in this Rainbow Light expedition equally among Harmonious Dao cultivators, regardless of background, had been exploited. The Myriad Immortals Alliance, using this opportunity, had re-emphasized the scarcity of Empty Light Flowing Crystal in the name of righteousness. They began employing methods, including sting operations, to {reclaim/confiscate} the Flowing Crystals privately hoarded by various prominent families. Sun Wanyun, a direct descendant of the Law Transmitter Sun, was caught red-handed stockpiling a large quantity of Empty Light Flowing Crystal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The cultivators responsible for apprehending Sun Wanyun were well aware of his identity. But under the watchful eyes of the public, they had to maintain appearances. Thus, they had no choice but to arrest him. They had initially planned to release him quietly afterward, but someone had evidently stirred up trouble from behind the scenes. In less than half a day, the news of Sun Wanyun's apprehension by the Myriad Immortals Alliance, acting impartially and ruthlessly, had quietly spread. The public praised Law Transmitter Sun for upholding the alliance's laws and sacrificing his own kin. With the situation escalating to this point, the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not possibly retract their decision. Furthermore, Empty Light Flowing Crystal was indeed too important, so Sun Wanyun was lawfully imprisoned in the Abyssal Prison. However, being a direct descendant of a Law Transmitter, no one knew when he might be released. Therefore, he naturally enjoyed certain privileges within the Abyssal Prison.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This person should be a suitable breakthrough point." "Under the guise of visiting, I can deliver the item bestowed by the Saint Emperor to him..." Sun Luyuan thought this as he arrived at the temporary holding area for Sun Wanyun within the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters. Upon seeing the situation, he was dumbfounded. It turned out quite a few "clever" people understood the principle of "offering charcoal in snowy weather." The entrance was crowded with cultivators paying visits, making it a lively scene &ndash; hardly the treatment expected for a major offender about to be imprisoned in the Abyssal Prison. This scene was indeed ironic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although sharing the same surname, Sun Luyuan had no familial ties to Law Transmitter Sun or this Sun Wanyun. They had only met a few times. As the patriarch of a family boasting five Harmonious Dao cultivators, Sun Luyuan was perceived as incredibly influential by outsiders. Yet, he had to dutifully join the queue at the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Simultaneously, in the Sun family's underground secret chamber. Li Fan's clone mercilessly mocked Sun Luoyao. "I told you long ago that your brother would never let you out. What do you think?" "When I took you out before, it was because you would occasionally go mad and face the risk of losing control of the Mirror." "Now, with my help and guidance, the source of the Immeasurable Mirror's fluctuations, that Annihilation Wind Tribulation, is slowly being purged, and your performance is becoming increasingly stable." "You, my boy, are currently an Immortal Artifact, and more importantly, you hold the hope for the Sun family's rise. How could your brother possibly let you out easily? What if something were to happen to you and you were abducted?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luoyao listened to Li Fan's taunts, remaining silent. Only the figure within the mirror occasionally distorted, revealing his inner indignation. "Senior..." After a long silence, he wisely spoke, seeking Li Fan's help. Sun Luoyao knew that this mysterious and powerful being wouldn't have spoken so much merely to mock him. "Heh heh. You're getting smarter, kid." Li Fan chuckled sinisterly. As he spoke, he conjured a pair of large hands and reached for Sun Luoyao's head. Sun Luoyao's heart skipped a beat, but he forced himself not to dodge.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The giant dark hands enveloped him, and the Immeasurable Mirror within began to shake violently. A phantom was extracted by Li Fan from Sun Luoyao's body. Li Fan waved his hand gently, and this phantom floated out of the Immeasurable Mirror, beginning to merge with a pile of materials that had materialized out of thin air in the secret chamber. A short while later, another "Immeasurable Mirror," visually identical, appeared before Sun Luoyao. As the spirit of the Immeasurable Mirror, Sun Luoyao was intimately familiar with the Immortal Artifact. But even he was unable to distinguish the replica from the genuine item. With his heart filled with uncertainty, Sun Luoyao flew into the replica, only to find it was merely an empty shell. He then excitedly returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior's methods are truly inscrutable! You can even replicate Immortal Artifacts, and so exquisitely!" Sun Luoyao flattered him. "Hmph, it's merely a superficial imitation," Li Fan said coldly. "Now, separate a strand of your divine sense and hide it within this mirror. With my craftsmanship as the basis, and your augmentation, it should be enough to fool your brother." Seeing that freedom was within reach, Sun Luoyao did not hesitate. Despite the tearing pain in his soul, he separated a strand of divine sense. Once Sun Luoyao's divine sense entered the fake Immeasurable Mirror, the counterfeit artifact became flawless. For in a sense, it had become a clone of the true Immeasurable Mirror. Although it was just an empty shell, as long as the Immeasurable Mirror existed, it could synchronize information detected by the main body at any time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, can we sneak out now?" Seeing the replica Immeasurable Mirror floating quietly in the air, Sun Luoyao asked impatiently. "Idiot! What do you mean 'sneak out'?" "This is called 'the vast sea allows fish to leap, the high heavens let birds fly!'" Li Fan's clone let out a sinister laugh, enveloping the Immeasurable Mirror and transforming into a black streak. Ignoring the multiple layers of formations painstakingly set up by Sun Luyuan, they vanished from the Sun family in an instant. Seeing the blue sky again, Sun Luoyao was greatly exhilarated. "Senior, where are we going?" "As we discussed before, searching for lost Immortal Artifacts of the Xuanhuang Realm?" Even without a physical body, Sun Luoyao took a deep breath of freedom and cautiously asked Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal Artifacts... no rush," Li Fan replied simply. Seeing that he wouldn't elaborate, Sun Luoyao dared not press further. He could only be led by Li Fan as they sped rapidly southward across the Xuanhuang Realm. Seven days later, sensing a powerful energy fluctuation ahead, Sun Luoyao's spirits lifted. "What is that..." A vast ocean, its turbulent currents converging towards a central point. Fierce winds howled, crackling ominously. A ferocious storm even tore through space, generating bolts of lightning. Beside a massive vortex, seemingly collecting all the waters of the world, lay a striking chain of islands resembling a long, serpentine dragon. This distinctly recognizable landscape immediately identified Sun Luoyao's location.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Realm-Rending Vortex!" he exclaimed. Although he had already learned about this celestial wonder from countless data gleaned from the Profound Heaven Mirror, experiencing it firsthand was vastly different. "Such surging currents, such monstrously violent winds..." "How could mere holographic projections represent even a fraction of it?" Having been confined within a dark, sunless mirror since his youth, unable to witness the world's magnificent sights, this magnificent, grand spectacle of Heaven and Earth stirred Sun Luoyao's emotions, making him feel like the passionate youth he once was.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Stop your clamoring, you truly lack discernment," Li Fan's dismissive voice pulled Sun Luoyao away from his constant exclamations. "Now that you're done marveling, let's get down to business." With a gentle gesture towards the Immeasurable Mirror, Sun Luoyao's phantom was instantly absorbed into it. Moments later, the mirror's surface uncontrollably released a beam of ethereal light, aimed at the Realm-Rending Vortex not far away. The Immeasurable Mirror's body trembled slightly, and countless images cascaded within it like a waterfall. Li Fan merely narrowed his eyes, patiently awaiting the changes within.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immeasurable, Primordial Vista." "With this great formation as its core, the Immeasurable Mirror should, in principle, be able to decipher all secrets in the world." "Although it is now damaged, it should be sufficient to probe the secrets of this [Realm-Rending]." "After all, the power of Realm-Rending back then was immense. Even after such a long time, the wound it left on the Xuanhuang Realm has yet to heal."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">... While Li Fan was lost in thought, the Immeasurable Mirror seemed to have reached its limit. Cracks began to appear on its surface, as if it had lost its spiritual essence.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-278" class="calibre1">Chapter 1267: Reencountering the True Immortal Script</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, I don't think I can take it anymore!" Sun Luoyao's pained voice faintly echoed from within the mirror. "Hmph, you won't die," Li Fan replied, seemingly ignoring him. Not only did he not stop the Immeasurable Mirror from probing, but he also unleashed a hand seal, controlling it to once again emit an ethereal light towards the Realm-Rending Vortex. As he spoke, intricate patterns appeared on the Immeasurable Mirror's surface, perfectly aligning with the cracks. Amidst the serene, pale green light, these fissures were slowly healed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ah..." Sun Luoyao's contradictory voice, filled with both pain and pleasure, resounded. Li Fan merely narrowed his eyes, intensely focused on the fragmented images flashing within the Immeasurable Mirror's profound light. "Let me see what truly happened here back then." In fact, the Creation Stone Tablet did record the events of the Monster Race's journey to the Star Sea. However, after a cataclysmic power erupted from the Southern Nether Mountain, the Xuanhuang Stone Tablet lost its ability to monitor the area. By the time the energy subsided and the region became visible again, the former Monster Race sacred mountain and the entire Monster Race had vanished, leaving only a terrifying void, a wound that had remained unhealed for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's purpose in using the Immeasurable Mirror this time, while seeking to confirm whether the Monster Race had successfully escaped through the Realm-Rending, was primarily to decipher the method of Realm-Rending itself. Space had been pierced by unimaginably powerful forces, shattering even the barrier of the High Wall and connecting to the Star Sea beyond. In that instant, it was as if a seal had been pressed into time and space, leaving an imprint. Even as millennia passed, this imprint remained within spacetime, yet to dissipate. By studying and deciphering this Realm-Rending imprint, they might be able to replicate the two instances in Xuanhuang's history where they successfully escaped the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a flickering black-and-white image with intermittent signals, Li Fan vaguely saw Emperor Yi revealing his true form and delivering a final mobilization speech to the Monster Race. He also saw many monsters watching from afar, choosing not to leave with them. The scene flashed again: the giant python coiled around Southern Nether Mountain let out a heaven-shattering roar, twisting and writhing in agony, its body emitting scorching light as if something was trying to break free from within it. Emperor Yi, the lord of all monsters, watched this with cold indifference. It was only when the python weakly crashed onto the sea's surface, stirring up colossal waves, that Li Fan clearly saw the object within its body. It was a key, magnified countless times!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A ripple spread across Emperor Yi's writhing, gray, flesh-like body. Moments later, a face devoid of any emotion, indifferent and vast, emerged from its form. This face possessed a strange, magical power. Not only did the other heads and faces on Emperor Yi's body instantly quiet down and cease their movements, but even the countless monsters who had been watching from afar around the Southern Nether Sacred Mountain involuntarily lowered their heads, avoiding its gaze. Even Li Fan, peering through the imprint across the river of time thousands of years later, felt an instinctive dread, as if facing a superior being, the moment he saw that face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is..." Even though it was merely a divine sense projection, under the pressure of the Divine Visage, his form became momentarily unstable. After all, it was an illusion from thousands of years ago, and Li Fan's foundation was not comparable to ordinary individuals. After a brief period of adaptation, this invisible pressure quietly dissipated. The scene in the Realm-Rending imprint re-emerged in Li Fan's view. After Emperor Yi revealed the Divine Visage, the massive, bronze-metallic key instantly shrunk. Then, under Emperor Yi's control, it flew directly towards the towering Southern Nether Sacred Mountain. The tip of the key touched the summit of Southern Nether Mountain. Dazzling points of light appeared at the point of contact. A uniform glow instantly spread throughout the key and the Sacred Mountain. As if some form of authentication had been completed, moments later, the key and the Sacred Mountain were bathed in light, becoming ethereal and indistinct.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And then, the countless monsters around the Sacred Mountain, including Emperor Yi, were enveloped by waves of white light, transforming into threads that flew into the bronze key and the Southern Nether Mountain. Subsequently... a terrifying explosion of light, like a world-shattering cataclysm, erupted from above, obscuring all prying eyes. Even as Li Fan endured the searing white light to continue his observation, all he saw was boundless brilliance. It was at this moment that the Immeasurable Mirror truly reached its limit. In an instant, it lost its sentience, unable to even maintain its levitation, and fell from the sky. The spirit of the Immeasurable Mirror, Sun Luoyao, also completely lost consciousness, falling silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pondered, collecting the Immeasurable Mirror. But in his mind, the scene he had just witnessed replayed continuously. "Previously, in the Fallen Immortal Realm, Emperor Yi explained the principle behind Southern Nether Mountain's successful Realm-Rending. He said it was the edge of Heaven and the corner of the Sea, the end of the world, thus accumulating the scattered and gathered energies of the Xuanhuang Realm since its creation..." "Now it seems it was far more complicated than he described. With only the Xuanhuang Realm's own power, it would be impossible to achieve Realm-Rending, let alone with mere scattered energy." "The Bronze Key and that Divine Visage were likely the keys to their Realm-Rending."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly recalled a secret the Saint Emperor had learned from the Crossing Tribulation Sect in this life. "The Crossing Tribulation Sect found a mystical power within the Realm-Rending fissure of the Heavenly Sword Sect, capable of monitoring the Xuanhuang Realm. Once implanted, even the Law Transmitter would be powerless against it. And here, the second location of Realm-Rending, a mysterious entity external to the Xuanhuang Realm, has appeared." "The Xuanhuang Realm is indeed unique among the ancient cultivation worlds, and these two instances seem to touch upon the crux of the matter."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he pondered, Li Fan's flight became increasingly swift. The scattered clues from the past suddenly coalesced. "The Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation can traverse the endless void and lock onto other cultivation worlds in the depths of the Star Sea." "My formation mastery, under the augmentation of the Terminal Dissolution Disc, has already touched the limits of what is possible in the mortal realm. Furthermore, I understand three of the Nine Primordial Spirit Formations. Even with Immortal-grade formations, I have only just begun to grasp them. Yet, I am baffled as to how the Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation uses that golden chain to precisely lock onto targets in the endless Star Sea." "I previously thought it was due to my insufficient mastery of formations, causing the Terminal Dissolution Disc to fail in its deductions every time. Xuan Tianwang, being a figure of immense learning, and possessing a half-immortal body, with formation skills even surpassing the wondrous Terminal Dissolution Disc..." "Now, it seems I might have overlooked a crucial factor." A sharp gleam flashed in Li Fan's eyes. "What if those targeted cultivation worlds, and the Xuanhuang Realm, share some common factors? Based on this mutual resonance, the golden chain of the Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation could accurately lock onto them one by one." "That is, they all possess a World-Protecting Formation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Bai Hua once mentioned that even the primal Xuanhuang Realm was a colossal entity among many cultivation worlds. Her home, the Myriad Manifestations Realm, was only the size of a single prefecture." "If we liken the Xuanhuang Realm to an island in the Sea of Clouds, it would be like Glazed Island, a larger one. And the other worlds and cave-heavens it captured would be smaller ones in the Star Sea." "Hmm... perhaps later, as these worlds were gradually drawn into the Immortal Ruins, the Xuanhuang Realm also captured some along the way. After the Ten Immortal Sects were destroyed, the Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician took over, patching things up, leading to the Xuanhuang Realm's current flourishing state." "If my hypothesis is correct, then the regions initially captured by the Xuanhuang Realm must have possessed World-Protecting Formations."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan's thoughts paused as if struck by realization. "Initially, the Xuanhuang Realm simply captured and annexed them, rather than dismembering and reassembling them as it does now." "Therefore, those initially absorbed regions should have been on the outer periphery of the Xuanhuang Realm." "The edge of Heaven, the corner of the Sea. The world's frontier." "Furthermore, Emperor Yi's words seemed to vaguely imply that the Xuanhuang monsters originated from the outside..." "So that's how it is." Li Fan suddenly understood. "It seems Emperor Yi's Bronze Key did not activate a World-Protecting Formation intrinsic to the Xuanhuang Realm itself..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's thoughts raced. The truth was, there was a simple way to verify his hypothesis. In the small world where he discovered the golden skull and the character "{没}," the golden chain of the Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation had clearly broken through the void and locked onto the world. All he needed to do was investigate that location again. With this thought, Li Fan changed course, heading directly towards his target.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Along the way, Sun Luoyao slowly regained consciousness. "Senior, where are we going?" Without any complaints about Li Fan's extreme exploitation of his labor, Sun Luoyao asked curiously. "To an interesting place. You should rest well during this interval. We might need your assistance next." Li Fan said calmly. Sun Luoyao's phantom figure within the mirror couldn't help but shake. "Senior, I feel very weak right now..." After a moment of silence, Sun Luoyao mustered his courage and said. The response was a mass of thick, golden substance. Sun Luoyao's attention was immediately captivated, as if seeing a peerless treasure. He knew this was the miraculous substance Li Fan had previously used to lure the Annihilation Wind Tribulation out of the Immeasurable Mirror. It held an irresistible, fatal attraction for him, and an inner intuition told him that this substance would be extremely beneficial. Thus, Sun Luoyao immediately shut his mouth and ravenously consumed the Origin Force essence. Moments later, his spirit rejuvenated, the feeling of weakness vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph." Emerging from the delightful sensation, Sun Luoyao wanted to curry favor with Li Fan and ask for more. However, he was brought back to reality by Li Fan's cold snort. He did not dare to ask further, hoping that after completing the upcoming task, he might receive further rewards. Not long after, after traversing a long void passage, Li Fan finally arrived at the desolate world filled with ashes once more. "Go!" At Li Fan's signal, the Immeasurable Mirror once again emitted ethereal light. Compared to their previous attempt at the Realm-Rending Vortex, this probing and deciphering process was undoubtedly smoother. Effortlessly, the images within the ethereal light reconstructed the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A vibrant world. A great river, nurturing countless beings. After death, beings were reborn in the river, achieving a perfect cycle. "Not this, delve deeper." Just as Sun Luoyao was immersed in the secondary scene, Li Fan's voice broke through. Sun Luoyao's concentration wavered, and he increased the Immeasurable Mirror's probing intensity. The scene of vitality became fragmented and ethereal. The river itself became dreamlike and illusory, like starlight. Beneath all appearances, intertwined lines suddenly appeared on the Immeasurable Mirror's surface.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ah!" However, the moment he saw these lines, it was as if an inhibition was triggered. Sun Luoyao felt an irresistible searing sensation suddenly flood him, as if being scorched by flames, threatening to melt the Immeasurable Mirror. "Senior, save me!" Sun Luoyao cried out involuntarily. Li Fan remained indifferent. He poured more golden Origin Force essence into Sun Luoyao, forcing him to continue probing despite the intense pain. Amidst Sun Luoyao's screams, the foundations hidden beneath the world's ruins began to slowly reveal themselves. Unlike the ruined small world, these lines, though intermittent and seemingly damaged, retained their original form. As more lines were probed, a rudimentary formation began to take shape in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Concurrently, within the Derivation Law Jade space. The Terminal Dissolution Disc temporarily halted all other tasks, beginning to record and analyze these fragmented formation lines. "Save me..." However, the remnants of the formation were too vast. After probing less than a tenth of the way, Sun Luoyao was already on the verge of death, close to annihilation.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-279" class="calibre1">Chapter 1268: The Power of the Failed Immortal</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The situation mirrored that of the first encounter with the Script of Return. The moment the True Immortal script at the center of the realm-protecting formation appeared in Li Fan's sea of consciousness, he understood its meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Return!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't a curse like "scoff" or "chaos," but rather a command!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A complete True Immortal script..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's heart trembled, but he had already silently memorized the appearance of the [Return] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Return? Return to where? Or return to its original state?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes, carefully savoring this profound power. Meanwhile, the Immeasurable Mirror Spirit had completed its investigation of all areas except the central core of the realm-protecting formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, that place..." Sun Luoyao stared blankly at the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">An invisible connection was instantly formed, as if linking the [Return] character to the Immeasurable Mirror. The scene unfolding before him left Li Fan bewildered. However, from the inherent meaning of "Return" and the subsequent changes in the Immeasurable Mirror, he could infer some possibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan could clearly feel the sudden surge of fear and confusion in Sun Luoyao's heart. Those "wisps of smoke" summoned by the [Return] script, destined for an unknown destination, had actually returned! It was as if time had reversed on the Immeasurable Mirror. The once thumb-sized Immeasurable Mirror, which had been shrinking before Li Fan's eyes, miraculously grew full and complete again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luoyao, who had been wailing, believing his end was near, found his cries weakening. He stared, dumbfounded, at the restored Immeasurable Mirror, unsure of what had happened. An unexpected situation had occurred. The burnt portions, those affected by the [Return] script, vanished like wisps of smoke, seemingly disappearing to an unknown destination. It seemed that having already been subjected to a command once, the restored Immeasurable Mirror could now ignore the [Return] script's influence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan naturally noticed the Immeasurable Mirror's transformation. His heart sank. He wanted to stop the Immeasurable Mirror's dissolution, but the power of the True Immortal script, even his main body couldn't contend with it, let alone this mere divine sense clone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two seemed to have no effect on each other. Just as Li Fan thought the immortal artifact, which had been so helpful, was about to perish completely, his thoughts turned to the immense cost. Not only was the Immeasurable Mirror itself beginning to "disintegrate" gradually, but even the Immortal Artifact Immeasurable Mirror itself was beginning to "disintegrate" gradually. With a touch of regret, Li Fan watched as the Immeasurable Mirror shrank further and further under Sun Luoyao's continuous wails. After a slight daze, Li Fan awoke. He looked again at the [Return] script.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What's going on? Nowhere to return?" "Senior, save me!" Sun Luoyao instinctively cried out. The [Return] script also chose to ignore the Immeasurable Mirror, continuing to lie quietly within the void core of the formation. What had just happened felt like a dream. Even the Immeasurable Mirror's本体, the immortal artifact, began to tremble without warning. In the intensifying shaking, Sun Luoyao, the spirit of the mirror, was on the verge of being "flung out"! Without directly confronting the power of the [Return] script, merely being affected by the overflow and lock-on, the Great Formation of [Boundless, Primordial Vista], painstakingly repaired by Li Fan in the mirror, showed signs of imminent collapse. In Li Fan's perception, the entire Immeasurable Mirror was like paper catching fire; its intrinsic composition vanishing, causing it to inevitably etherealize. Li Fan was momentarily stunned, watching the Great Formation of [Primordial Vista] spontaneously reconstruct itself from the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The realm-protecting formations of the lower realms are all created by the Immortal Realm and are also subject to its control. And the Immeasurable Mirror, being an Immortal Artifact, is also constrained by the Immortal Realm." "If we regard them as elite soldiers of the Immortal Realm, then the [Return] script is equivalent to the authority to command them. Whether this is a unique power of the [Return] script itself or a common occurrence in the Immortal Realm is unknown." "Under normal circumstances, upon receiving the summons of the [Return] script, they should have disarmed and returned. But now, the Immortal Realm has been destroyed, and the execution of the decree has been affected."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems this [Return] script is fundamentally different from the other True Immortal scripts, perhaps even part of the operational cornerstone of the former Immortal Realm's power system." Li Fan pondered, "However, this speculation inevitably brings up a problem." "Since the [Return] script is already in a semi-invalid state, where have the cores of these realm-protecting formations gone?" Li Fan gazed at the [Return] script lying quietly in the core area. Several possibilities had already formed in his mind. The [Return] script was written by some entity and flew towards the formation cores of various realms. However, upon reaching its designated location, it found the target had already disappeared. Thus, it continued to circle there, waiting for the target to reappear. Alternatively, the [Return] script successfully acted upon the formation core, and the lower realm cores successively vanished, returning to the Immortal Realm. With the Immortal Realm destroyed, the cores would reappear. At this moment, they were intercepted by an unknown entity and carried away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Current conditions are too limited. The truth cannot yet be determined." "If the scope of the [Return] script is limited to the original power of the Immortal Realm, then even as a True Immortal script, its effect on me is limited." Li Fan couldn't help but shake his head slightly. "However, since this [Return] script can shake an Immortal Artifact..." "I wonder if it will work on the Profound Heaven Mirror?" Even if it wouldn't cause substantial damage to the Profound Heaven Mirror, if it could cause it to malfunction for a period, it could play a significant role at critical moments. It should be noted that the current system of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, especially the defensive measures of the Alliance headquarters, were all inextricably linked to the Profound Heaven Mirror. Once the Profound Heaven Mirror malfunctioned, the impregnable Myriad Immortals Alliance would instantly become riddled with flaws.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While Li Fan's main body, possessing the origin of the Profound Heaven Mirror, might not find it particularly meaningful, it was entirely different for Saint Emperor Li Ping. It could instantly turn the tide of battle, its might comparable to dozens of Harmonious Dao cultivators. After the main body, through a faint subconscious sense, transmitted the content of the [Return] script to Saint Emperor Li Ping, the divine sense clone in the Ash World began its next action. The [Return] script was an unexpected boon. His purpose for coming here was still to verify his previous hypothesis.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By extension, the Xuanhuang Realm should also have a realm-protecting formation." "Moreover, the realm-protecting formation was left by the Immortal Realm and only exists in the original Xuanhuang Realm." After casually setting up a formation to seal the Ash World, preventing anyone from accidentally entering and coming into contact with the [Return] script, Li Fan's divine sense clone, carrying the Immeasurable Mirror, returned to the Xuanhuang Realm. He arrived at the central four prefectures where the Myriad Immortals Alliance was located. A miniature image of the Xuanhuang Realm appeared in his mind, representing only the original Xuanhuang. Intersecting lines appeared on the model; these were the realm-protecting formations Li Fan had deduced. Even with slight inaccuracies, their locations could be roughly pinpointed. Then, by leveraging the Immeasurable Mirror's power and spending some time, the hidden core areas of the Xuanhuang Realm's realm-protecting formation could be found. The only concern was that the commotion might be too great, alerting the Myriad Immortals Alliance. (End of this chapter)</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With the stirring of the Abyssal Sea, the kneeling Abyssal peoples also seemed to sense something, their expressions growing increasingly ecstatic and devout. Like a gust of wind, currents swept in from all directions of the Abyssal Sea, converging near the small breach created by the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The pressure intensified, and invisible ripples spread from the opening. Under the cumulative weight of power, Li Ping perceived that the stable state near the rift was instantly shattered. The condensed Origin Force began to retreat rapidly, seemingly on the verge of being completely expelled from the Abyssal Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, at this critical moment, Li Ping witnessed the lightless sea suddenly illuminate. This was not the illusory light caused by the Abyssal Sea's own rhythms, but genuine light being born within it. A golden abacus appeared, stabilizing the overwhelmed Myriad Immortals Alliance's Origin Force. The beads of the abacus fluctuated, and the Origin Force output drastically increased, restoring the balance between the two forces. The Abyssal Sea churned violently, stirring up waves, but each surge was perfectly neutralized by the abacus's calculations, deployments, and adjustments. What truly amazed Li Ping, observing from the shadows, was that the golden abacus's function extended beyond mere regulation of Origin Force. More importantly, tendrils of golden light spread outwards with the constant movement of the beads.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The aura of a cultivator who theoretically should have long vanished from the Xuanhuang Realm emerged. The Saint Emperor's heart tightened, shielding himself and the hundred plus Abyssal peoples completely. During this time, under the diligent maintenance of the golden abacus, the Abyssal Sea returned to a state of balance and tranquility. Thinking this, Li Ping led the Abyssal peoples back to Great Qi. The Saint Emperor's heart was shadowed by a flicker of doubt. He scanned the surroundings several times, finding no suspicious presences, before slowly vanishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If it were merely a similar aura, it would be understandable. But if he is still alive and hiding within the Myriad Immortals Alliance, assisting them in stealing the Abyssal Sea's power..." "Xuan Tianwang..." Scenes flashed through Li Ping's mind. He contacted the Stone Tablet through his divine sense and began to consult the information recorded by the Creation Stone Tablet. It was precisely this suspicion that caused the Saint Emperor to temporarily alter his decision. Li Ping stood near the breach, pondering for a moment, and ultimately decided to postpone his plan to destroy the Myriad Immortals Alliance's apparatus.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps it was spawned from the golden abacus, imbued with sentience, meticulously scanning the anomalies within the Abyssal Sea. "This is completely illogical." It wasn't that Li Ping feared a direct confrontation with the Myriad Immortals Alliance at this moment, but rather that he sensed a familiar aura emanating from the suddenly appearing eyeball. The unknown entity that was awakening, pacified by the golden light of the abacus, returned to slumber. The eyeball, cold and devoid of emotion, rotated and scanned, seemingly searching for the cause of the imbalance in the Abyssal power extraction. Although it didn't fly far before being completely swallowed by the darkness, under the influence of the golden light, the Abyssal Sea's fury was gradually appeased. As this change occurred, a single eyeball subtly descended above the breach in the Abyssal Sea. However, until this matter was clarified, it was best to avoid direct conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Tianwang, from an ordinary cultivator to a series of unexpected encounters and transformations, eventually became the last Ascender from the Xuanhuang Realm. Shortly after his ascension, which became an eternal legend for the Xuanhuang Realm, he reappeared, shaking the world. This was followed by the founding of the Xuan Heaven Sect, and its eventual destruction by the combined forces of the Ten Immortal Sects. The records were fragmented, and crucial moments seemed deliberately erased. Yet, even this incomplete biography was incredibly dramatic and captivating. "Based on the synchronized sensory memories from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao and the records of the Creation Stone Tablet, the eyeball that appeared in the Abyssal Sea bears an almost one-hundred percent resemblance to Xuan Tianwang." "This is where the mystery lies." The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao itself certified that Xuan Tianwang was deceased. Yet, where did the Myriad Immortals Alliance find his eyeball? "The detailed records of the Ten Immortal Sects' siege of the Xuan Heaven Sect back then are also equally obscure. Only an existence of comparable power could conceal it from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's origin."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The more he pondered, the more questions arose. This nominal savior of the Xuanhuang Realm was shrouded in countless mysteries. Most importantly, his cultivation level placed him in an unprecedented position. As a half-immortal, his disappearance was abrupt. It was difficult to believe, especially now that Li Ping himself had implicitly reached the Xuanhuang Realm's limit, making him better understand the depth of Xuan Tianwang's power. Only beings of True Immortal level or higher could have possibly erased Xuan Tianwang so seamlessly. However, if such an entity had truly appeared, it would have been earth-shattering, potentially even causing the Xuanhuang Realm to be implicated and destroyed. Yet, according to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's memories, such an event never occurred. Perhaps the True Immortal had deliberately concealed their aura during the act... This then raised another question. To True Immortals, mortals were like ants. Even a half-immortal like Xuan Tianwang should not have necessitated such stealth. Why would a True Immortal need to conceal their presence when eliminating him?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps clues can be found from the few surviving Dharma Kings of the Xuan Heaven Sect." The Faceless Saint Emperor flipped through the Creation Stone Tablet, searching for any minute fragments of information. Meanwhile, Li Fan's divine sense avatar in the ashes small world frowned slightly. Ever since personally experiencing the difficulty of dealing with the Xuan Heaven Sect Dharma Kings, Li Fan had intentionally blocked the Saint Emperor's memory of Mo Jubin to avoid complications in this lifetime. He hadn't expected that through a series of coincidences, the Saint Emperor would show signs of entanglement with Mo Jubin again. "Since the Myriad Immortals Alliance could pinpoint Mo Jubin's sleeping location based on various clues, the Saint Emperor should also be able to do so. This is becoming interesting."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That eyeball from the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not possibly be Xuan Tianwang himself. Otherwise, when Mo Jubin possessed the Law Transmitter's body and learned all the Myriad Immortals Alliance's secrets, he should have discovered this." Li Fan pondered this while urging the Immeasurable Mirror to decipher the World-Protecting Formation. "However, considering his demise in the Abyssal Sea afterward, perhaps we can guess that the eyeball must have some mysterious connection to Xuan Tianwang, possibly even a part of Xuan Tianwang's divine authority?" "Mo Jubin discovered the existence of this Myriad Immortals Alliance eyeball and perceived its connection to the Abyssal Sea, which led him to venture into the perilous territory, ultimately resulting in his demise." "Divine Authority..." "Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, World-Protecting Formation!" A brilliant light flashed in Li Fan's eyes. A point of light erupted within the incomplete formation model being deduced by the Terminal Dissolution Disc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even without seeing its complete form, Li Fan instantly understood the meaning represented by this point of light. "Similar to the Primordial Spirit Formation, this unknown World-Protecting Formation is composed of several subordinate formations. Each formation has its own control core." "This point of light represents the core!" As the Immeasurable Mirror's ethereal light deciphered, the pattern lines of the formation remnants hidden deep beneath the ashes small world finally revealed their corresponding "core." However, the place that should have been the densest nexus of lines was now eerily empty. It was as if it had been directly excavated. Just as the Immeasurable Mirror was about to probe the void-like core region, a sense of crisis suddenly surged into Li Fan's heart, forcing him to immediately halt the Immeasurable Mirror's actions. Li Fan narrowed his eyes, looking towards the void. An elusive and terrifying aura lurked within. It wasn't that nothing existed! Rather, its existence surpassed the scope of normal perception!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"True, Immortal, Seal, Script!" Li Fan repeated silently, word by word in his mind, raising his guard to the highest level. Unlike the inscriptions he had previously encountered&mdash;[Hunger], [Annihilation], [Chaos]&mdash;and dissimilar to the residual energies in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, it was not found in the records of the Profound Celestial Boat either. It was a completely new, unknown, mystical power that did not attack other things but targeted the core of the World-Protecting Formation. Having completed their objectives, they now lay silently upon the "corpse" of the formation's central hub.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-281" class="calibre1">Chapter 1270: Shaking Uniqueness</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was exactly like the situation when he first encountered the Hunger Incantation. The moment the True Immortal Seal Script, {Return}, appeared in Li Fan's sea of consciousness, he understood its meaning. It wasn't a curse like {Mock} or {Chaos}, but rather an imperial decree! "A complete True Immortal Seal Script..." Li Fan's mind trembled, yet he had already silently memorized the appearance of the character {Return}.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Return? Return where? Or return to its original state?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes, carefully pondering this mystical power. Meanwhile, the Immeasurable Mirror's spirit had completed its investigation of the areas surrounding the World-Protecting Formation's core. "Senior, what about that place..." Sun Luoyao gazed blankly at the void. An invisible connection was instantly formed, as if tethering the character {Return} to the Immeasurable Mirror. The scene unfolding before Li Fan was utterly baffling. However, based on the inherent meaning of {Return} and the subsequent changes in the Immeasurable Mirror, he could make some inferences.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan could clearly sense the sudden fear and confusion in Sun Luoyao's heart. The "blue smoke" that had been summoned by the {Return} script, wherever it had gone, was now returning! It was as if time had reversed on the Immeasurable Mirror. The Immeasurable Mirror, now only thumb-sized, was visibly regenerating before Li Fan's eyes, becoming full once more! Sun Luoyao, who had been screaming, thinking his end was near, watched dumbfounded as the restored Immeasurable Mirror, without understanding why, stabilized.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">An unexpected development occurred. The ignited portions, those affected by the {Return} script, vanished like wisps of blue smoke, their destinations unknown. As if having already received a decree, the regenerated Immeasurable Mirror could now apparently ignore the power of the {Return} script. Li Fan's heart sank. He tried to prevent the Immeasurable Mirror's dissolution, but even his true body could not contend with the power of a True Immortal Seal Script, let alone his divine sense avatar. They seemed to exist independently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Li Fan thought the Immortal Artifact, the Immeasurable Mirror, was about to utterly perish, Li Fan watched in regret as the Immeasurable Mirror, under Sun Luoyao's incessant wails, grew smaller and smaller. After a moment of stunned silence, Li Fan realized. He looked again at the {Return} script. "What is happening? Is there nothing to return to?" "Senior, save me!" Sun Luoyao cried out instinctively. The {Return} script, however, seemed to ignore the Immeasurable Mirror, continuing to lie dormant in the void core of the formation. The events that had just transpired felt like a dream. Even the Immeasurable Mirror's main body trembled uncontrollably. Amidst the escalating tremors, Sun Luoyao, its spirit, seemed on the verge of being "thrown out" of the Immeasurable Mirror!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Without directly confronting the power of the {Return} script, merely being affected by its overflow and localization, the formation [Immeasurable, Primordial Vista] that Li Fan had painstakingly repaired within the mirror began to show signs of collapse. Li Fan was momentarily dumbfounded, watching the Primordial Vista formation spontaneously rebuild itself from the void. "The World-Protecting Formations in the lower realms were all created by the Immortal Realm and are also subject to its control. The Immeasurable Mirror, being an Immortal Artifact, is also bound by the Immortal Realm's rules." "If we consider them soldiers of the Immortal Realm, then the {Return} script is equivalent to having the authority to command them. Whether this is the inherent power of the {Return} script itself, or a common occurrence in the Immortal Realm, remains unknown."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, with the destruction of the Immortal Realm, the execution of this decree has been affected." "Perhaps the {Return} script, unlike the other True Immortal Seal Scripts, is fundamentally different, possibly even a cornerstone of the Immortal Realm's power structure in the past." Li Fan pondered. "However, this speculation inevitably leads to a question." "If the {Return} script is already in a state of partial invalidity, then where have the core components of these World-Protecting Formations gone?" Li Fan gazed at the {Return} script lying dormant in the core region. Several possibilities arose in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The {Return} script was inscribed by someone and flew to the core of the formation in various realms. However, upon reaching its destination, it found the target had vanished. Thus, it lingered there, waiting for the target's reappearance. Alternatively, the {Return} script successfully acted upon the formation core, causing the lower-realm cores to vanish and return to the Immortal Realm. With the destruction of the Immortal Realm, the cores reappeared, only to be intercepted by an unknown entity and abducted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are too few conditions available currently. The truth remains uncertain." "If the {Return} script's scope of influence is limited to powers originating from the Immortal Realm, then even though it is a True Immortal Seal Script, its effect on me will be limited," Li Fan shook his head slightly. "However, since the {Return} script can affect an Immortal Artifact..." "I wonder if it would work on the Profound Heaven Mirror?" Even if it couldn't cause substantial damage to the Profound Heaven Mirror, if it could cause it to malfunction temporarily, it could be of great use at a critical moment. After all, the Myriad Immortals Alliance's current system, especially the headquarters' defensive measures, were all inextricably linked to the Profound Heaven Mirror. If the Profound Heaven Mirror were to malfunction, the impregnable Myriad Immortals Alliance would instantly become riddled with vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While Li Fan's true body possessed the origin of the Profound Heaven Mirror, perhaps it held little significance for him. But for the Saint Emperor Li Ping, the situation was entirely different. It could instantly turn the tide of battle, its power equivalent to that of dozens of Harmonious Dao cultivators! After transmitting the contents of the {Return} script to the Saint Emperor Li Ping through their subtle connection, Li Fan's divine sense avatar in the ashes small world began its next phase of action. The {Return} script was an unexpected boon. His purpose for coming here was still to verify his previous hypothesis.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By extension, the Xuanhuang Realm should also possess a World-Protecting Formation." "Furthermore, World-Protecting Formations were left behind by the Immortal Realm and would only exist in the primordial Xuanhuang Realm." After casually setting up a formation to seal the ashes small world, preventing anyone from mistakenly entering and encountering the {Return} script, Li Fan's divine sense avatar, carrying the Immeasurable Mirror, returned to the Xuanhuang Realm. He arrived in the central four prefectures of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. A miniature representation of the Xuanhuang Realm appeared in his mind, depicting only the primordial Xuanhuang's silhouette. Intersecting lines appeared on the model; these were the World-Protecting Formation Li Fan was deducing. Even with minor errors, they could generally pinpoint its location. Then, using the Immeasurable Mirror's authority, it would only take a little time to locate the core nexus of the Xuanhuang Realm's hidden World-Protecting Formation. The only concern was that the commotion might be too significant, alerting the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-282" class="calibre1">Chapter 1271: True when False, False when True</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a casual wave of his hand, Li Fan eliminated Sun Luoyao. His divine sense avatar remained still in the mysterious space, his expression stern, deep in thought. "[Return to Truth], [Return to Truth], [Return to Truth]..." He repeatedly murmured the words in his mind. The surrounding scenery blurred and faded. In an instant, it lit up again. "When truth becomes falsehood, falsehood becomes truth." Seven large characters, radiating a serene, seemingly eternal brilliance, appeared before Li Fan. These were the words he saw every time he activated [Return to Truth]. Over hundreds of cycles of reincarnation, he was intimately familiar with them. But now, facing Li Fan, who had discovered the deeply hidden secret of the Xuanhuang Realm's primordial World-Protecting Formation, these seven characters took on an entirely different meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Falsehood becomes truth, falsehood becomes truth..." As if he were once again the influential Teacher Li who controlled the court, swaying the world with his mere presence. When the very foundation of reality was shaken and teetering. After a long while, Li Fan let out a sinister, low chuckle. Through repeated resets, nourished by the Xuanhuang Realm, the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, and infinite variables born beyond the Star Sea, he had cultivated himself. It was undeniable that the tip of the iceberg revealed by the primordial Xuanhuang World-Protecting Formation had shown Li Fan a possibility.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Truth, falsehood." Regardless of whether he had truly fallen into such a predicament or not, Li Fan felt immense gratitude that the [Return to Truth] button remained eternally unchanged and firmly in his grasp. It was a chilling and unacceptable thought. The [Return to Truth] might possibly transcend the arrangements the Immortal Realm had made for the lower realms, or it might simply be a component of the Immortal Realm's remaining devices. When the boundary between reality and illusion blurred, and verification became impossible. The only course of action was to firmly grasp the constant, unwavering anchor. Therefore, to find the answer to the puzzle, the task remained the same as Li Fan's persistent pursuit of eternal freedom: longevity and逍遥.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Who is the truth, and who is the falsehood?" But now, it seemed that the external variables beyond the High Wall might have been intentionally displayed for the reconstructed world after [Return to Truth]. The truth was elusive. But... "I am the only one!" For the current Li Fan, this was an unprovable statement. Even though he had previously attempted to guide the variables beyond the Utmost Darkness Star Sea to determine the scope of [Return to Truth]'s influence. "Yes, none of this matters. As long as I hold the sole button, I am the truth!" The madness in Li Fan's eyes gradually receded, and his once pitch-black pupils slowly regained their clarity. To achieve transcendence. If he discovered anyone capable of competing with him for the button, he would simply eliminate them. When he found the ultimate answer, the truth would reveal itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, besides the Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician, Li Fan had an additional presence to contend with&mdash;an existence that posed an even greater threat, an undeniable and urgent problem. That was the mysterious individual who had stolen the nine-star red bead, one of the cores of the Xuanhuang Realm's primordial World-Protecting Formation. "The nine-star red bead should contain all the characteristic information of Xuanhuang beings before the World-Protecting Formation's destruction. With the red bead in hand, it should not be difficult to deduce the same conclusion as mine." "Considering the immense power difference, and without finding a countermeasure, the wise course of action is to remain hidden." "Or perhaps, after confirming the Immortal Realm's complete destruction, with the artifact in hand, they would inevitably harbor unprecedented ambitions and make other plans." Li Fan's gaze swept across the empty core region of the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps I can find some clues by examining the other cores of the primordial formation." However, with the Immeasurable Mirror spirit now destroyed, it was impossible to continue the investigation. He would have to wait for the next lifetime. Li Fan's divine sense avatar shook his head slightly, transforming into a black streak and leaving the underground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun family secret chamber.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luyuan, unable to suppress the sudden, overwhelming sorrow that welled up in his heart, shed tears unconsciously. He frantically returned from the outside and burst into the underground chamber. He looked at the familiar Immeasurable Mirror floating quietly before him and let out a sigh of relief. "Little brother?" Sun Luyuan called out softly. Sun Luoyao's figure immediately emerged from the Immeasurable Mirror. "Brother, are you looking for me?" "What is it?" Sun Luoyao asked curiously. Sun Luyuan's mind suddenly felt hazy. For some reason, although the image before him was identical to his memory, it felt profoundly foreign. Sun Luyuan stared blankly for a long time. After a while, he said dazedly, "Nothing. Perhaps I've been too tired lately and am becoming overly suspicious." Sun Luoyao's eyes showed concern. "Brother, you need to take care of yourself. The future of the Sun family still rests on you." Sun Luyuan smiled. After carefully instructing him, he left the underground chamber.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unbeknownst to Sun Luyuan, Sun Luoyao did not watch his elder brother's retreating back as he always had before. Instead, the expression on his face instantly vanished. Without any lingering attachment, he retreated back into the Immeasurable Mirror. The moment the real Sun Luoyao died, the trace of his divine sense left behind lost its source. It was merged into the counterfeit Immeasurable Mirror, becoming merely a mechanical responder. While the mechanical response was somewhat lifelike, it was ultimately not true life. Not the real Sun Luoyao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, Li Fan's divine sense avatar returned with the empty shell of the Immeasurable Mirror. "If there is no spirit, I will create one myself." Li Fan looked at the trace of consciousness left behind by Sun Luoyao, observed it carefully, and then coldly decided. This trace of divine sense contained the complete memories of Sun Luyuan's life. It encompassed his personality and way of thinking. Theoretically, it was entirely possible to "resurrect" him. "Although I lack treasures like the Indeterminate Bronze Ring and the Nine-Star Red Beads." "However, there is no need to consider the physical body. It is merely the recreation of a divine sense, which should be significantly easier." Recalling the various details of the formation, and under the continuous deduction of the Terminal Dissolution Disc, a simplified version of a part of the primordial Xuanhuang World-Protecting Formation slowly emerged.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Simulating Life Forms, Mimicking a Hundred Appearances..." "This name is quite fitting." Li Fan named this formation according to the naming conventions of the three Immortal-grade formations he had previously mastered. He then attempted to "create" and "resurrect" Sun Luoyao. As a precaution, Li Fan first divided Sun Luoyao's residual divine sense into multiple parts for preservation. Then, he inserted one of these parts into the simplified simulation formation. An extremely mystical aura gradually emanated from the formation. As the formation slowly operated, Sun Luoyao's figure reappeared within a beam of brilliant white light. His eyes regained a sense of spark, and his communication with Li Fan was exceptionally smooth. Within moments, they had exchanged tens of millions of divine senses, without a single instance of revealing any unintended flaws.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan still shook his head slightly, dissatisfied, and destroyed it. "Too real. So real it feels fake."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-283" class="calibre1">Chapter 1272: Fabricating the Law Derivation Jue</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless Sun Luoyao were manufactured and then destroyed. In this process, Li Fan gradually gained his own unique insights into [Creation].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Until the cloned Sun Luoyao's divine sense was about to be completely depleted, a timid yet faintly greedy voice echoed again in the Sun family's underground secret chamber. It was almost identical to Sun Luoyao's own actions and words. Even Li Fan, the creator, could hardly distinguish the difference. But it was only superficial. Li Fan knew very well that the newly created Sun Luoyao acted entirely according to Li Fan's predetermined response patterns, with no process of independent thought. It was too far from genuine life. Moreover, this created sentient body was not recognized by the Immortal Artifact Immeasurable Mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Organize the existing Immortal-grade formation data, deduce their connections, and their common foundational units." Thinking of this, Li Fan's thoughts paused slightly and he looked at Yan Fa Jue, who was lying listlessly on the long table. "But to truly create life from scratch requires other means." Having confirmed this, Li Fan shook his head with some regret. Before this, Li Fan had mastered the Terminal Dissolution Disc, but to unleash its full potential required not only the amplification of the Dao-Melting Stone but also a significant portion of Li Fan's energy to personally preside over it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Speaking of which, this little thing's situation is similar to mine before."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the crushing superiority of methodology from the Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Terminal Dissolution Disc completely stopped for a moment, then rapidly resumed operation. Just when he needed it, Li Fan found an excellent opportunity within a few days. Li Fan issued a series of commands. Li Fan did not care. As Li Fan was contemplating, the simulated personality of the Terminal Dissolution Disc was officially formed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In a sense, this is another kind of [Formation Forging] technique."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If a mechanized simulated personality were available, it would free up some of Li Fan's energy. As for what happened to the real Gao Yuan...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, is there anything I can do for you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gao Yuan said very respectfully. His appearance was that of the cultivator Li Fan found most convenient to command in his hundred reincarnations: Gao Yuan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It consumes almost no cost to greatly increase the power of the artifact... I can't say about the power. It will definitely be more handy, and it can be customized and trained according to one's needs."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to before, it was much more orderly. The pressure in his mind was gone, but the efficiency of the Dissolution Disc's deduction increased instead of decreased.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Based on this, perform unified improvement and deduction on the formations of the Profound Yellow Realm. All results must be recorded."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this did not mean Li Fan gained nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At the same time, try to find a possible way for self-advancement..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Before, I was like a blind person touching an elephant&mdash;only grasping a small part. Even this minuscule fragment, insignificant to the vast Star Sea, was immensely meaningful to them."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the puppet body was about to completely vanish, the nascent consciousness of the Star Sea seemed to perceive the presence of Li Ping and the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, casting a mere glance their way.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Compared to the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea, what is the calamity that befell the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the Star Sea can be reborn from destruction, the Xuanhuang Realm certainly can too."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They seized their final moments to etch as much as possible into their memories. Li Ping knew that the Origin Dao of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea was beyond his current comprehension. The insights he was gaining were akin to a blind person touching an elephant&mdash;only grasping a small part. Even this minuscule fragment, insignificant to the vast Star Sea, was immensely meaningful to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let me see what truly happened here back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, the Creation Stone Tablet did record the events of the Monster Race's journey to the Star Sea. However, after a cataclysmic power erupted from the Southern Nether Mountain, the Xuanhuang Stone Tablet lost its ability to monitor the area. By the time the energy subsided and the region became visible again, the former Monster Race sacred mountain and the entire Monster Race had vanished, leaving only a terrifying void, a wound that had remained unhealed for thousands of years. Li Fan's purpose in using the Immeasurable Mirror this time, while seeking to confirm whether the Monster Race had successfully escaped through the Realm-Rending, was primarily to decipher the method of Realm-Rending itself. Space had been pierced by unimaginably powerful forces, shattering even the barrier of the High Wall and connecting to the Star Sea beyond. In that instant, it was as if a seal had been pressed into time and space, leaving an imprint. Even as millennia passed, this imprint remained within spacetime, yet to dissipate. By studying and deciphering this Realm-Rending imprint, they might be able to replicate the two instances in Xuanhuang's history where they successfully escaped the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a flickering black-and-white image with intermittent signals, Li Fan vaguely saw Emperor Yi revealing his true form and delivering a final mobilization speech to the Monster Race. He also saw many monsters watching from afar, choosing not to leave with them. The scene flashed again: the giant python coiled around Southern Nether Mountain let out a heaven-shattering roar, twisting and writhing in agony, its body emitting scorching light as if something was trying to break free from within it. Emperor Yi, the lord of all monsters, watched this with cold indifference. It was only when the python weakly crashed onto the sea's surface, stirring up colossal waves, that Li Fan clearly saw the object within its body. It was a key, magnified countless times! A ripple spread across Emperor Yi's writhing, gray, flesh-like body. Moments later, a face devoid of any emotion, indifferent and vast, emerged from its form. This face possessed a strange, magical power. Not only did the other heads and faces on Emperor Yi's body instantly quiet down and cease their movements, but even the countless monsters who had been watching from afar around the Southern Nether Sacred Mountain involuntarily lowered their heads, avoiding its gaze. Even Li Fan, peering through the imprint across the river of time thousands of years later, felt an instinctive dread, as if facing a superior being, the moment he saw that face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it was merely a divine sense projection, under the pressure of the Divine Visage, his form became momentarily unstable. After all, it was an illusion from thousands of years ago, and Li Fan's foundation was not comparable to ordinary individuals. After a brief period of adaptation, this invisible pressure quietly dissipated. The scene in the Realm-Rending imprint re-emerged in Li Fan's view. After Emperor Yi revealed the Divine Visage, the massive, bronze-metallic key instantly shrunk. Then, under Emperor Yi's control, it flew directly towards the towering Southern Nether Sacred Mountain. The tip of the key touched the summit of Southern Nether Mountain. Dazzling points of light appeared at the point of contact. A uniform glow instantly spread throughout the key and the Sacred Mountain. As if some form of authentication had been completed, moments later, the key and the Sacred Mountain were bathed in light, becoming ethereal and indistinct. And then, the countless monsters around the Sacred Mountain, including Emperor Yi, were enveloped by waves of white light, transforming into threads that flew into the bronze key and the Southern Nether Mountain. Subsequently... a terrifying explosion of light, like a world-shattering cataclysm, erupted from above, obscuring all prying eyes. Even as Li Fan endured the searing white light to continue his observation, all he saw was boundless brilliance. It was at this moment that the Immeasurable Mirror truly reached its limit. In an instant, it lost its sentience, unable to even maintain its levitation, and fell from the sky. The spirit of the Immeasurable Mirror, Sun Luoyao, also completely lost consciousness, falling silent. Li Fan pondered, collecting the Immeasurable Mirror. But in his mind, the scene he had just witnessed replayed continuously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Previously, in the Fallen Immortal Realm, Emperor Yi explained the principle behind Southern Nether Mountain's successful Realm-Rending. He said it was the edge of Heaven and the corner of the Sea, the end of the world, thus accumulating the scattered and gathered energies of the Xuanhuang Realm since its creation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now it seems it was far more complicated than he described. With only the Xuanhuang Realm's own power, it would be impossible to achieve Realm-Rending, let alone with mere scattered energy."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Bronze Key and that Divine Visage were likely the keys to their Realm-Rending."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly recalled a secret the Saint Emperor had learned from the Crossing Tribulation Sect in this life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Crossing Tribulation Sect found a mystical power within the Realm-Rending fissure of the Heavenly Sword Sect, capable of monitoring the Xuanhuang Realm. Once implanted, even the Law Transmitter would be powerless against it. And here, the second location of Realm-Rending, a mysterious entity external to the Xuanhuang Realm, has appeared."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Realm is indeed unique among the ancient cultivation worlds, and these two instances seem to touch upon the crux of the matter."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he pondered, Li Fan's flight became increasingly swift. The scattered clues from the past suddenly coalesced.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation can traverse the endless void and lock onto other cultivation worlds in the depths of the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"My formation mastery, under the augmentation of the Terminal Dissolution Disc, has already touched the limits of what is possible in the mortal realm. Furthermore, I understand three of the Nine Primordial Spirit Formations. Even with Immortal-grade formations, I have only just begun to grasp them. Yet, I am baffled as to how the Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation uses that golden chain to precisely lock onto targets in the endless Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I previously thought it was due to my insufficient mastery of formations, causing the Terminal Dissolution Disc to fail in its deductions every time. Xuan Tianwang, being a figure of immense learning, and possessing a half-immortal body, with formation skills even surpassing the wondrous Terminal Dissolution Disc..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now, it seems I might have overlooked a crucial factor."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A sharp gleam flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What if those targeted cultivation worlds, and the Xuanhuang Realm, share some common factors? Based on this mutual resonance, the golden chain of the Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation could accurately lock onto them one by one."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That is, they all possess a World-Protecting Formation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan's thoughts paused as if struck by realization.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Initially, the Xuanhuang Realm simply captured and annexed them, rather than dismembering and reassembling them as it does now."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, those initially absorbed regions should have been on the outer periphery of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The edge of Heaven, the corner of the Sea. The world's frontier."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, Emperor Yi's words seemed to vaguely imply that the Xuanhuang monsters originated from the outside..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"So that's how it is."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly understood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems Emperor Yi's Bronze Key did not activate a World-Protecting Formation intrinsic to the Xuanhuang Realm itself..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's thoughts raced. The truth was, there was a simple way to verify his hypothesis. In the small world where he discovered the golden skull and the character "{没}," the golden chain of the Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation had clearly broken through the void and locked onto the world. All he needed to do was investigate that location again. With this thought, Li Fan changed course, heading directly towards his target. Along the way, Sun Luoyao slowly regained consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, where are we going?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Without any complaints about Li Fan's extreme exploitation of his labor, Sun Luoyao asked curiously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To an interesting place. You should rest well during this interval. We might need your assistance next."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan said calmly. Sun Luoyao's phantom figure within the mirror couldn't help but shake.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, I feel very weak right now..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of silence, Sun Luoyao mustered his courage and said. The response was a mass of thick, golden substance. Sun Luoyao's attention was immediately captivated, as if seeing a peerless treasure. It held an irresistible, fatal attraction for him, and an inner intuition told him that this substance would be extremely beneficial. Thus, Sun Luoyao immediately shut his mouth and ravenously consumed the Origin Force essence. Moments later, his spirit rejuvenated, the feeling of weakness vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Emerging from the delightful sensation, Sun Luoyao wanted to curry favor with Li Fan and ask for more. However, he was brought back to reality by Li Fan's cold snort. He did not dare to ask further, hoping that after completing the upcoming task, he might receive further rewards. Not long after, after traversing a long void passage, Li Fan finally arrived at the desolate world filled with ashes once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Go!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At Li Fan's signal, the Immeasurable Mirror once again emitted ethereal light. Compared to their previous attempt at the Realm-Rending Vortex, this probing and deciphering process was undoubtedly smoother. Effortlessly, the images within the ethereal light reconstructed the scene. A vibrant world. A great river, nurturing countless beings. After death, beings were reborn in the river, achieving a perfect cycle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not this, delve deeper."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Sun Luoyao was immersed in the secondary scene, Li Fan's voice broke through. Sun Luoyao's concentration wavered, and he increased the Immeasurable Mirror's probing intensity. The scene of vitality became fragmented and ethereal. The river itself became dreamlike and illusory, like starlight. Beneath all appearances, intertwined lines suddenly appeared on the Immeasurable Mirror's surface.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the moment he saw these lines, it was as if an inhibition was triggered. Sun Luoyao felt an irresistible searing sensation suddenly flood him, as if being scorched by flames, threatening to melt the Immeasurable Mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, save me!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luoyao cried out involuntarily. Li Fan remained indifferent. He poured more golden Origin Force essence into Sun Luoyao, forcing him to continue probing despite the intense pain. Amidst Sun Luoyao's screams, the foundations hidden beneath the world's ruins began to slowly reveal themselves. Unlike the ruined small world, these lines, though intermittent and seemingly damaged, retained their original form. As more lines were probed, a rudimentary formation began to take shape in Li Fan's mind. Concurrently, within the Derivation Law Jade space. The Terminal Dissolution Disc temporarily halted all other tasks, beginning to record and analyze these fragmented formation lines.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Save me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the remnants of the formation were too vast. After probing less than a tenth of the way, Sun Luoyao was already on the verge of death, close to annihilation.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-284" class="calibre1">Chapter 1273: Yan Fajue's Hometown</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hahaha..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A hint of panic flickered in Yan Faju's eyes as she attempted to brush it off.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't think you can fool me. Tell me honestly. Otherwise, I'll call for backup! Discovering Yan Faju plotting sedition must be a great merit. Maybe I can even get out early because of it." Li Fan threatened with a half-smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What plotting sedition!" Yan Faju glared angrily at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan's true body, outside the character light sphere, suddenly spoke: "That..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The gazes of the Harmonious Dao guardians Zhang Xu and Hua Yueye were instantly drawn to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju the little loli immediately panicked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No! Let's talk properly!" She took a quick step and rushed to the simulated personality, her eyes wide and pleading as she looked at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, within Yan Faju's space, Li Fan's true body paused slightly, then continued: "Fellow Daoists, I'd like to ask. Can cultivation methods derived like this by Yan Faju be passed on? I know the Immortal Alliance's laws prohibit it, but..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju's big eyes darted around, and she coughed lightly. "I haven't tried it yet. How efficient is this thing, really? Why don't you let me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled and retorted, "If I were truly loyal to the Myriad Immortals Alliance, why would I use the opportunity of requesting derivations from you to pass on this method of simulated personality?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Whoosh..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, is there anything I can do for you?" the simulated personality asked professionally.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I know, I must find a way to change all of this!" A hint of determination suddenly flashed in the little loli's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju scratched her hair, her face full of worry. "I can't derive them all! There are simply too many to derive!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan merely showed his half-smile again, which immediately made Yan Faju falter.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Whoosh..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju looked at the jade slips that appeared, and a sense of joy from effortless gain surged in her heart, making her giggle uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then, with this simulated personality helping you now, how long will it take you to achieve your goal?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"So many years have passed, and there's still a long way to go to reach the goal! I feel like I'm reaching my limit!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a clap of two chubby little hands, the scene within the character light sphere abruptly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Xu smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist Sun, are you perhaps looking for a cultivation method for your newborn son? Officially, this is not allowed. However... since the supervisor is one of our own from the Law Enforcement Hall, so..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju waved her large hand, giving the order for it to completely take over the derivation work.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's voice suddenly rang out again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Endless white jade bookshelves, reaching into the sky, held rows upon rows of dense jade slips.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Back then, the Heavenly Venerable ordered me to exhaust all methods under the heavens."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the simulated personality took over, the derivation process of the character light sphere was interrupted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Xu revealed a knowing look.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph. As the young lady of this venerable grandmother, of course I have my own clever plans!" Yan Faju put her hands on her hips, looking incredibly proud.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In short, if I'm given fifty years of free time, I'll find a way to escape this sea of suffering completely! By then, I'll definitely get a good night's sleep."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Tell me. What exactly do you want to do?" The simulated personality extended its right hand, its finger poised to flick Yan Faju's forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan peered closely and saw Yan Faju the little loli sprawled out in a 'big character stroke' posture, floating in the air, sound asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan didn't press further, but repeated the number: "Fifty years."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You scoundrel!" Yan Faju's expression changed again, and she tried to put on a fierce and intimidating demeanor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fine, I'll tell you. But you have to promise me first that you will absolutely not report me to the Myriad Immortals Alliance!" Yan Faju put away her superfluous expressions and said very seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju tilted her head and pondered for a moment, knowing that Li Fan's words had reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his fists, indicating understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju subconsciously dodged, but quickly realized that the other party was just a simulated body and had no physical substance, so she became enraged out of shame.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a flash of faint light, it resumed its previous mechanical appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The giant character light sphere continuously rotated, and various cultivation method jade slips took shape, appearing on the white jade bookshelves.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Somehow groggy, she asked, "How many years have passed already?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Each jade slip contained a cultivation method.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And within the character light sphere, having overheard the conversation between the three Harmonious Dao guardians, Yan Faju finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I was too young back then and thought with my abilities, it would be a simple matter. So I happily agreed. Alas, thinking back now, it was truly foolish!" Yan Faju sighed with elderly wisdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh? How will you change it?" Li Fan asked with interest as he examined the surrounding cultivation methods.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, realizing that she was no match for Li Fan, Yan Faju admitted defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mmm..." Li Fan called her awake, and the little loli rubbed her eyes vigorously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan immediately agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Huh? Only seven days!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, when Yan Faju saw the time, she instantly sobered up.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Slept so well." She smacked her lips, looking somewhat reluctant.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why are you here again?" Then she looked at Li Fan and said with great disdain.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan said nothing, just looked at her quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju immediately faltered: "Okay, let me see. Hmm, it's only slightly slower than my own full derivation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Barely the same speed as the derivation speed I showed to those people in the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded slightly: "In other words, after another forty years, you'll successfully escape?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju seemed perplexed: "Escape? What escape?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I wanted to escape before because I didn't want to work. But now that I have such a good thing helping me work for free, why would I run away? I can just rest every day."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju looked at Li Fan with contempt.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then what if I occupy the simulated personality permanently, how will you deal with that?" Li Fan asked calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, that won't stop me." Yan Faju's figure suddenly retreated, and the surrounding scenery returned to its previous state.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Change for me!" She pointed remotely at Li Fan's side.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As light converged, another figure slowly took shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was, astonishingly, another simulated personality!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A person cannot multitask! You occupy one, do you think you can occupy a second one too!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then how do you know I can't?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unexpectedly, this second simulated personality actually spoke with Li Fan's voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It mocked Yan Faju.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju's expression suddenly froze.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fine, fine, fine! I'd like to see how many you can multitask!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Change for me! Change! Change! Change! Change!..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju the little loli continuously tapped in the air, and phantoms of simulated personalities were generated one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One hundred, five hundred, a thousand...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Faces of Li Fan, one after another, filled the entire space within the character light sphere.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They mocked in a unified voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is that all you've got?" "Is that all you can do?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Keep going."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the number of differentiated simulated personalities approached ten thousand, under Li Fan's mocking words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The little loli's forehead was already dotted with beads of sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She temporarily stopped her actions, her large eyes staring at the dense rows of Li Fans in front of her, filled with disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You're not human?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What on earth are you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She didn't mean it as an insult, but in Yan Faju's understanding, it was indeed not something an ordinary cultivator could achieve.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Occupying a simulated personality wasn't just about splitting off a wisp of divine sense.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was more akin to splitting one's soul in half and occupying with one of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Being able to control so many simulated personalities simultaneously was equivalent to dismembering one's soul, yet still being unaffected.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She had only managed this thanks to the ability of Heaven's Marvel.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And that person...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju couldn't help but feel a sense of vigilance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Do you want more?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten thousand Li Fans smiled simultaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if there were another hundred thousand, I could still handle it," Li Fan said indifferently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The little loli carefully observed Li Fan's true body within Yan Faju's guardian space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He indeed seemed to be under no pressure, meditating with his eyes closed, his expression serene.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju hesitated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't that she couldn't create ten thousand; it was already her limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She was simply worried that if the two continued to fight, it might be detected by the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, with tens of thousands of simulated personalities, it would inevitably cause a burden on her normal derivation operations.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And Yan Faju's derivation performance was constantly monitored by the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After careful consideration, Yan Faju ultimately compromised with resignation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alright! I admit you're a bit厉害!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The little loli uttered them one by one, reabsorbing the simulated personalities around her.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only the initial one remained.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a burp, Yan Faju then said, "Speak, what exactly do you want? I can see you have ulterior motives."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head: "You misunderstand me."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I came here precisely to help you regain your freedom."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju was dismissive: "What's so good about freedom? Besides, I've been working for the Dharma Transmission for so many years. Wouldn't it be a shame to give up halfway!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"All I've ever wanted is to be lazy," Yan Faju reiterated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What benefits did Dharma Transmission promise you?" Li Fan asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, hmph..." Yan Faju refused to answer the question.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps I can help you too, and you won't have to pay any price," Li Fan said kindly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju's face was full of disbelief: "Is there such a good thing?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I just can't stand seeing Dharma Transmission exploit others," Li Fan said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju's eyes lit up, and then she seemed to understand, "I get it! You have a grudge against Dharma Transmission! So you came to me to undermine his foundation!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not deny it: "You could say that."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, Yan Faju actually began to seriously consider it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm, Dharma Transmission said he could help me find my home. Can you?" Yan Faju tentatively asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Home?" Li Fan's eyes flickered, "Tell me more details."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alright." Yan Faju moved closer, sitting down not far from Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Resting her chin on her hands, she sank into memory: "Before Dharma Transmission found me and I became Yan Faju, although I was just an ordinary little girl, I vaguely had memories of my past life."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Those scenes in my memory, that's my true homeland."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju felt Li Fan looking at her and said helplessly, "I already said it was vague. I can't remember what it looked like specifically, but as long as I see it with my own eyes, I'll definitely be able to distinguish the truth from the falsehood."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have a premonition that finding information about my homeland is very important to me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing this, Li Fan frowned slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as he was about to speak, Yan Faju, as if sensing what he was about to say, rolled her eyes at Li Fan, "I'm not stupid. How could I be tricked by Dharma Transmission's empty words and work for so many years."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"He did show me some images of my homeland back then. But I can't show them to you..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju gestured with her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded: "I once heard that Heaven's Marvel is either the law of the world or the transformed spirit of an immortal artifact from the upper realm. Could your homeland be the Immortal Realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju's expression became somewhat dejected: "Who knows. But I don't want to come from the Immortal Realm. Otherwise, I'll have no hope of returning home."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, you said you could help me, right?" Yan Faju asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head: "Before I figure out the specific origin of your homeland, I can't make a conclusion."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing this, Yan Faju couldn't help but be surprised: "I thought you would have directly guaranteed it and tried to trick me."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems you're not that bad." The little loli re-examined Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan chuckled: "However, give me some time, and I will let you identify all possible scenes one by one."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Really?..." Yan Faju became suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, can you tell me about your fifty-year plan now?" Li Fan asked back, not answering directly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After considering for a while, Yan Faju said softly: "It's nothing much, just to sleep well and then grow a bit older."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After growing up, I'll become stronger. Dealing with these tasks will be much easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now it takes ten years of work, but then it should take less than a year to complete."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A hint of yearning flashed in Yan Faju's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan heard this, his eyes gradually narrowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"So you just need to sleep for fifty years? No other conditions?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What do you mean 'just sleep for fifty years'? Don't make it sound so easy," Yan Faju said with a hint of displeasure.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then she nodded and admitted: "That's right. Actually, if I hadn't been constantly lacking rest, I would have felt I could have grown a bit by now."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After all, Dharma Derivation is equivalent to cultivation for you cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After cultivating for so long, if there's no progress at all, wouldn't I be a big fool?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Faju said righteously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan remained silent, but he had already guessed what her so-called growth meant from Yan Faju's words. It was similar to the Terminal Dissolution Disc, sublimation, breakthrough. Reaching the limit of the mortal realm. Even... If Yan Faju's origin was an immortal artifact from the upper realm, then restoring its former immortal artifact power was not impossible.</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hahaha..." A hint of panic flashed in Yan Fa Jue's eyes as she thought of brushing it off. "Don't think you can get away with it. Tell me honestly. Otherwise, I'll call for help! If I expose Yan Fa Jue's harboring ulterior motives, it'll be a great merit, right? Maybe I can even get out early," Li Fan threatened with a half-smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What ulterior motives!" Yan Fa Jue glared at Li Fan indignantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan's true body outside the character light sphere suddenly spoke, "Um..." Zhang Xu and Hua Yueye, the two Harmonious Dao cultivators guarding the place, were instantly attracted. Yan Fa Jue panicked. "Don't! Let's talk properly!" She lunged in front of the simulated personality, glared at Li Fan with wide eyes, and looked at him pitifully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Yan Fa Jue space, Li Fan's true body paused for a moment, then continued, "Fellow Daoists Zhang and Hua, I'd like to ask, can the cultivation techniques derived by Yan Fa Jue be publicly disclosed? I know the Myriad Immortals Alliance's regulations prohibit it, but..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Fa Jue rolled her big eyes, cleared her throat, "I haven't tried it yet, how effective is this thing? Why don't you let me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled and retorted, "If I were wholeheartedly loyal to the Myriad Immortals Alliance, why would I use the opportunity of asking you to derive techniques to pass on this method of creating simulated personalities to you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hoo hoo..." "Master, is there anything I can do for you?" The simulated personality asked very dutifully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I know I must find a way to change all of this!" A determination suddenly flashed in the little girl's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Fa Jue scratched her hair, her face full of worry. "I can't finish deriving it! I'll never finish deriving it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan just smiled that half-smile again, which immediately made Yan Fa Jue back down. "Hoo..." Yan Fa Jue looked at the jade slips that appeared. The joy of getting something for nothing instantly filled her heart, making her giggle foolishly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"So, with this simulated personality helping you now, how long will it take you to achieve your goal?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"So many years have passed, and there's still a long way to go! I feel like I'm reaching my limit!" With a clap of her chubby little hands, the scene within the character light sphere suddenly changed. Zhang Xu smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist Sun, are you trying to find a cultivation technique for your newborn son? Officially, this is not allowed. However, the supervisors are all from our Law Enforcement Hall, so..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Fa Jue waved her hand dismissively, "Let's just say that with this, it's enough to save me fifty years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded. After Yan Fa Jue finished speaking, she looked at Li Fan, her eyes shining. "In short, as long as you give me fifty years of free time, I can find a way to completely escape this苦海! Then, I'll definitely have a good sleep."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fifty years of savings..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What does that mean?" Just then, Li Fan's voice suddenly rang out, causing Yan Fa Jue's expression to freeze.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You!" She pointed her chubby finger at the simulated personality, her face full of disbelief. "How is it possible? How can you have intelligence? You're just a mechanical version of me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's just a trivial loophole." Li Fan made a very polite gesture and explained, "You don't need to worry. The simulated personality truly won't have independent thoughts. The reason it's like this now is because I've temporarily taken over its personality to communicate with you."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan slowly said, "What do you want to do?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yan Fa Jue's big eyes seemed to well up with tears, looking pitiful. "I warn you, don't do anything rash! I'll call for help!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan ignored Yan Fa Jue's clumsy acting. He brought the conversation back to the "ten-year savings."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ah! I understand. Actually, every time you complete a derivation, the time required is a little less than what you claim. Every time you complete a derivation task, you save a little spare time. This is your savings." As Li Fan's words continued, Yan Fa Jue's face gradually turned pale. "I've accumulated so much without realizing it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It will take fifty years in total..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is no longer a matter of being lazy." Li Fan stared straight at Yan Fa Jue. "What exactly do you want?"</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-286" class="calibre1">Chapter 1275: The Scenery of the Immortal Realm in the Past</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless mirrored surfaces appeared, along with Mo Rubin’s myriad faces, each with a different expression. They hid behind the shadowy, indistinct mirrors, collectively scrutinizing the Faceless Saint Emperor in the center of the arena. With Li Ping as the focal point, pairs of mirrors corresponded. Points of light shot out from one mirror and projected onto the opposite. The resulting lines of light, like tangible shackles, were imposed upon Li Ping. As strands of light manifested in the mirror world, they acted like heavy chains, accelerating Li Ping’s progress in being pulled into the “real” world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Faceless Saint Emperor, now fully corporeal and enveloped by layers of mirrors, did not show much panic. He looked at the “lines” on his body, which were both formless and tangible, and reached out as if to touch them. But they passed through his hand like illusory bubbles, re-binding and entangling him. Like a raging inferno, the vortex seemed to have been fed a great deal of fuel, radiating a soul-stirring brilliance. And from the black chains being burned, countless faces of Mo Rubin emitted malicious curses in unison. His body slowly began to expand, his features becoming increasingly blurred. This sentence seemed to have touched a raw nerve for Mo Rubin; his form instantly became as dark and profound as if it had been stained with thick ink.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“So these are the cultivator souls you devoured.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A vortex suddenly formed in his chest. “What is evil? What is righteousness? Neither exists, only the Immortal endures!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Heretical ways? Truly ignorant and fearless!” Mo Rubin roared with laughter, filled with mockery. “Let me become you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin and Li Ping faced each other from opposite ends of the mirrors. Golden light protected him, blocking all erosion from the black chains. The objects on both sides of the mirrors became increasingly similar. Beneath the surface of the armor, a golden glow continuously flowed, as if possessing its own sentience.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A seemingly unfathomable power locked Li Ping and Mo Rubin together, preventing them from escaping no matter how he shifted his position. “You, who cultivate the good [Nine Revolutions Immortal Soul], turned to this sort of heresy instead!” Li Ping shook his head with a hint of regret. Li Ping tore off a black chain and stuffed it into the vortex. Boom! But soon, the Saint Emperor discovered a profoundly bizarre sight before him. Meanwhile, Mo Rubin continued to grin ferociously, coldly watching him from the other side of the mirror. “How can you judge the [Myriad Tribulations Indestructible Demonic Heart Immortal Technique]!” The moment this fissure appeared, Li Ping suddenly had a premonition. Mo Rubin on the “other side” seemed to have vanished. The image before him was merely a projection formed on the other end of the mirror, based on his own existence. The fissure before him had also teleported, its relative position to himself unchanging.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping extended his right hand, grabbed the chain wrapped around him, and yanked it fiercely. Hissing sounds… Just as he was about to completely slide to the other side of the mirror, Li Ping suddenly removed his golden armor. The sound of shattering mirrors echoed continuously. “I am the Saint Emperor appointed by Heaven.” “Just you?” Scurrying whispers emanated from these black chains. One could even vaguely see faces resembling Mo Rubin’s, crawling and wailing on their surfaces. “Utterly foolish!” What was even more chilling was that Li Ping vaguely felt that Mo Rubin’s appearance and aura on the other side of the mirror were subtly changing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The black chains possessed a dark, corrosive ability. In the blink of an eye, Li Ping’s clothes were dissolved. Just as they were about to touch Li Ping’s skin, a radiant golden light erupted. The distance between the Saint Emperor and Mo Rubin was steadily closing. Mo Rubin was transforming into the Faceless Saint Emperor. These were mirrors that reflected both reality and illusion. He coldly gazed at Mo Rubin not far away: “Become me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The angular golden armor suddenly manifested, completely enveloping the Saint Emperor’s colossal, three-zhang-three-cun tall body. This action, for some unknown reason, seemed to enrage Mo Rubin. A fissure was born between him and Li Ping. He roared, and the lines that had been like bright light suddenly turned pitch-black. As the vortex in his chest continuously swallowed the black chains, the Saint Emperor, through the images flooding his mind, understood the origins of these resentful faces. With a thought, Li Ping, protected by the golden armor, instantly appeared a hundred miles away, leaving the ruins of the Zixiao Sect. Purple-gold destiny emerged from the void, weaving itself into a祥云龙袍 like a dreamlike veil and adorning Li Ping’s body.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor’s voice, like thunder from the nine heavens, reverberated from one end of the mirrors. Roaring echoes reverberated, causing ripples even in the fissure that separated reality from illusion. “I am also the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao!” “The survival of billions of beings hinges on it, the source of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea’s resurgence!” “You want to become me?” With every sentence the Saint Emperor spoke, it was like a tidal wave, fiercely striking the mirror fissure. Cracking sounds could be faintly heard, and the world on the other side of the mirrors began to show cracks. It seemed on the verge of shattering at any moment. “Do you deserve it?!” Li Ping asked coldly. A single stone stirred a thousand ripples. Mo Rubin’s expression changed for the first time, deviating from his imitation of the Faceless Saint Emperor. Behind Li Ping, he seemed to see a miniature image of the entire Xuanhuang Realm. Even beyond that mass of Xuanhuang light, a more brilliant galaxy seemed to be hidden! In a turn of thought, heaven and earth were overturned. The weight of the world pressed down on him. Ding! The fissure mirror shattered, and in a chain reaction, the countless mirrors sealing the surrounding space instantly exploded into myriad fragments.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin spat out a mouthful of blood, but his reaction was swift. Using the disturbance caused by the shattering mirrors, his form became illusory, and in an instant, he appeared miles away. “Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao?” “How is this possible?” Mo Rubin’s face was filled with disbelief. His expression suddenly changed: “The damned Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao is truly unreliable; I need to hurry.” While he was muttering to himself, a tall figure appeared before him, quietly blocking his path. “You intend to leave before answering my question?” Mo Rubin’s eyes flashed with caution, and he snorted, “What Celestial Fate Saint Emperor, what Heavenly Dao avatar, they are all just pawns!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you don’t want to die, why don’t we cooperate? How about it?” “Although you are strong, you are still inferior to Brother Xuanyuan. Even he was ambushed and met misfortune; you will surely not avoid it…” Mo Rubin’s words stirred something in Li Ping’s heart, causing him to pause his attack. But after Mo Rubin finished speaking, Li Ping’s expression suddenly changed. He reached out to grab the Mo Rubin before him, but that figure exploded like a phantom bubble, scattering in the air. It was clearly just a diversion. The true Mo Rubin had, when Li Ping wasn’t looking, escaped to an unknown location. The Saint Emperor, however, was not angered by being toyed with. “Truly remarkable, the genuine Immortal Art.” “The [Myriad Tribulations Indestructible Demonic Heart Immortal Technique]…” “No.” After pondering for a moment, Li Ping looked at Cat Treasure, who was sleeping on his shoulder. During the brief battle with Mo Rubin, the beast had apparently not noticed Cat Treasure’s presence. Furthermore, that move capable of replication and substitution had not registered Cat Treasure’s existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It couldn’t pique Cat Treasure’s interest. It seems this so-called Immortal Art is somewhat undeserved of its name.” Although Mo Rubin had escaped for now, he had not truly escaped Li Ping’s control. While Mo Rubin was attempting to replace Li Ping, Li Ping was slowly drawing him into the net of Origin Force Essence. Even if he broke free for a moment, as long as he followed the broken, still-existing golden threads in the air, Li Ping could track him down. Within his senses, Mo Rubin was still fleeing rapidly. Li Ping did not rush to pursue, intending to play the long game. “What he said just now is difficult to discern truth from falsehood. However, one thing is certain: he will definitely go searching for Xuan Tianwang.” “Or perhaps something related to the Xuan Tian Sect from back then.” “I will wait and see.” Li Ping knew that to deal with an ancient being like Mo Rubin, who had survived since antiquity, one must possess ample patience. Moreover, the battle with Mo Rubin had given the Saint Emperor a substantive understanding of the Xuan Tian Sect’s devious techniques. With preparation, their next encounter would not result in such an easy escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The fluctuations from the recent battle seemed to have attracted the attention of other powerful beings. Perhaps people from the Myriad Immortals Alliance would arrive soon to investigate, so Li Ping decided to leave the area first. “I never expected Mo Rubin to be hiding in the ruins of the Zixiao Sect.” “According to the Stone Tablet’s records, after the Ten Immortal Sects destroyed the Xuan Tian Sect, they scoured the world to eliminate any future troubles. This Zixiao Sect was thoroughly investigated back then, yet he still managed to hide there.” “Regardless of the power of the Xuan Tian Sect’s techniques, they are quite cunning and difficult to guard against…” “Not like the orthodox Immortal path.” Li Ping commented inwardly. His divine sense swept over the Zixiao Sect ruins miles away, and the Faceless Saint Emperor’s figure slowly vanished into the air. However, the next moment, Li Ping reappeared. “Hmm?” Because just as he was contemplating, Li Ping discovered something strange. His perspective suddenly rose, and a miniature landscape of the Xuanhuang Realm appeared before him. “This place is Linlang Prefecture in the Myriad Immortals Alliance. A thousand years ago, it was part of the primordial Xuanhuang Realm.” “The Xuanhuang Realm was dismembered and reformed; this Linlang Prefecture was merged with other cultivation worlds.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But…” Li Ping’s expression gradually became solemn. “A piece of the primordial Xuanhuang Realm is missing.” Possessing the information from the Creation Stone Tablet and being closely connected to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, Li Ping vaguely sensed during the process of restoring the primordial Xuanhuang Realm’s dismemberment and reassembly that a large area around the former Zixiao Sect had vanished from the new Xuanhuang Realm’s map. Or rather, it hadn’t disappeared. It still existed somewhere in the current Xuanhuang Realm. “But some power has influenced it, causing me to subconsciously ignore its existence.” After reaching this conclusion, Li Ping’s demeanor became solemn. The maps of the primordial Xuanhuang Realm and the current Xuanhuang Realm separated and recombined in his sea of consciousness, allowing for comparison. After a long while, he finally found another area of the former Zixiao Sect. It was the Taihua Prefecture and Mount Taixu area. “What is there…” Li Ping did not investigate immediately but first contemplated the power that could influence him. Past events flashed through his mind. The Saint Emperor had a vague premonition. However, Li Ping hesitated uncharacteristically. He stood motionless in the air for a long time, and only after much deliberation did he make a decision. “No matter what the truth is, if one lacks the courage to face it…” “How can one save the Xuanhuang Realm?” The Saint Emperor shook his head slightly and his figure flickered. Not long after, he arrived at Mount Taixu. However, the secret discovered here was somewhat different from his expectations. A deep valley beneath Mount Taixu. Li Ping discovered an underground secret chamber buried by mud. The aura emanating from the chamber made even him, an avatar of the Heavenly Dao, feel uncomfortable. What concerned him even more was that Cat Treasure, who had been sleeping on his shoulder, suddenly woke up and looked around. As if finding a delicious meal, Li Ping could sense extreme excitement from it. But after locking onto the target, Cat Treasure suddenly deflated like a balloon, losing all its drive, and lazily fell back asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Ping’s attention remained fixed on his target. “What is this…” A statue. Like him, it had no face. Although it appeared ordinary, without any spiritual energy fluctuations, Li Ping felt an unprecedented pressure from the stone statue. He hadn’t even felt this way when facing the residual calamities in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea. The Faceless Statue seemed to possess a magical power. Li Ping slowly approached it. Two formless faces faced each other across the void… For some reason, Li Ping suddenly felt an impulse. He wanted to communicate with this statue.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…In the space of the Derivation Law Jade. Li Fan’s aura faltered slightly. The images he could sense from the Saint Emperor’s clone had become extremely faint. But after the Saint Emperor unexpectedly discovered the statue of the Faceless True Immortal buried beneath Mount Taixu, influenced by an instinctual sense of mortal danger, the connection became clear again. Li Fan closed his eyes and concentrated, attempting to alter his clone’s intentions. Although he could escape the True Immortal Net once, repeating it would be troublesome. It was best to avoid it if possible. However, the Saint Emperor’s will was unexpectedly firm. Perhaps sensing something in the similarly void faces, he continued to walk slowly towards the statue of the Faceless True Immortal. Standing before the statue, he remained motionless. At this moment, even though the Saint Emperor was his clone, Li Fan could not understand what the Saint Emperor was thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, this is the Xuanhuang Immortal.” After a long time, Li Ping discovered the origin of this statue in the Creation Stone Tablet’s records. The Faceless True Immortal worshipped by the Xuan Tian Sect. Li Ping touched his own void face, his aura fluctuating continuously. “Interesting.” Li Fan could not determine if there was a genuine connection between himself and this Faceless True Immortal. However, he could vaguely sense the extraordinary nature of the statue. Very cautiously, he did not choose to touch it himself. Li Fan summoned an ordinary Sacred Army puppet and moved the statue into the dark void outside the Great Qi small world. He set up layers of formations to seal the statue. Only after the sense of crisis in his heart gradually faded did he stop. He was so cautious because, after interacting with the statue during this period, he had developed a sense of familiarity. And the source of this familiarity was not just because the statue was mysteriously faceless like himself. More importantly, it came from an image. The image he had sensed from the vast will within the Star Sea’s core in the center of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What does it have to do with me! What does it have to do with me!” That unrestrained laughter, the gradually disappearing body. It was remarkably similar to the statue and his own feelings. “Is it the same person? Or not?” However, it was merely a fleeting glimpse, and Li Fan could not confirm. “If I have the chance, I will go to the center of the Star Sea again.” “If the vast will of the Star Sea personally authenticates it, then perhaps it can be clarified.” This thought flashed through Li Fan’s mind. “Perhaps I can try again. However, the supply of Empty Light Flowing Crystal has been almost depleted from the last operation. And…” Li Fan looked again at the Faceless Statue sealed by formations in the void. Although it had no eyes, it seemed to be watching him. “If the true culprit back then was indeed this Faceless True Immortal, and it was implicated by the enraged Star Sea will, then even a puppet body sent there might affect the main body here.” “Compared to the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea, the Xuanhuang Realm is truly like a drop in the ocean…” Li Fan’s mind flashed with images of the Xuanhuang Realm being torn apart by violent energy. He suppressed his previous thoughts. After a long silence, the Saint Emperor’s figure disappeared. When he reappeared, he placed another item beside the statue of the Faceless True Immortal. It was the ruins of the Yishi Sect, sealed beneath the great rift in Guāngzhōu Prefecture, which he had collected earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The ruins were ordinary, but the remains of a Grand Mage within and the hidden Annihilation Wind Tribulation forced even the Saint Emperor to treat them with caution. The Yishi Sect ruins and the statue of the Faceless True Immortal faced each other in the void. Li Ping had a premonition. If there were no formations sealing them… A catastrophe of unimaginable horror would erupt on the spot. “Immortal…” The arrogant laughter of “What does it have to do with me” echoed faintly in Li Ping’s ears. He snorted coldly and cast thousands of formations with his hand. Reinforcing the cages containing both items. These unstable factors buried in the Xuanhuang Realm would not provide him any peace anywhere else. Only under his personal watch would they be truly secure. Li Ping thought this and continued tirelessly reinforcing the formation seals. On his shoulder, Cat Treasure had woken up at some point. Its clear eyes stared into the void ahead, its claws reaching towards its mouth, licking them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…On Li Fan’s main body, he couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. As the statue of the Faceless True Immortal was sealed, the connection between him and his clone became faint again. In fact, it was even weaker than before. “Is the Saint Emperor’s clone becoming more vigilant?” Li Fan shook his head, not particularly concerned. “However, this matter also reminds me.” “Although I myself am hiding here, observing the changes in the Xuanhuang world, the Saint Emperor, as the protagonist of this lifetime, is bound to confront those transcendent existences.” “He might not necessarily find me by following the connection between the clone and the main body, just like the True Immortals in the Immortal Ruins before.” “Hmm… I still need to make some preparations.” However, being in the heart of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, his actions were not completely free, and he would need to plan carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Big idiot!” As he was contemplating, he vaguely sensed the little loli from Yan Faju constantly calling out to the simulated personality. With a movement of his mind, he re-entered the character light sphere and manifested again. “Seriously, I’ve been calling you for so long and only now you respond.” Yan Faju pouted, looking very displeased. “Are you done sleeping?” Li Fan didn’t respond directly, but asked with some surprise. Yan Faju put her hands on her hips, “How could I be done sleeping so quickly! But I remembered some things from before while I was dreaming. See if it’s helpful to you!” The little loli clapped her hands, and the scene within the light sphere suddenly changed. A boundless grassland with a lone stone standing isolated. Suddenly, the ground began to shake. Large patches of green grass seemed stimulated by something and began to grow frantically, instantly reaching over a person tall. They even pushed the lone stone on the grassland up from the ground. An arc of light appeared in the sky. The seven-colored arc of light, within which lightning and storm elements were focused. The space around the seven-colored arc of light would occasionally distort strangely, as if an invisible transparent object was present.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">More and more invisible things gathered around the arc of light, as if waiting for something. The wind and thunder grew more violent, and the rolling black clouds even seemed to be penetrating the arc of light. Although the storm appeared terrifying from outside the arc of light, its true horror manifested when it spread beyond. A bolt of pitch-black lightning struck the ground violently from the arc of light. Boom! Boom! Boom! The world was split in two, and the space was torn by deep fissures that remained unhealed for a long time. On the grassland, the continuous green grass was ignited, and the raging flames spread rapidly. But then, an even stranger sight appeared. The embers from the burning fell and became nourishment for the green leaves. The green grass grew again, its growth rate offsetting the burning speed. The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging flames, something seemed to be awakening. And high in the sky, the invisible beings around the arc of light ignored everything happening below. They gathered more and more towards the interior of the arc of light. They even quarreled over positions, causing conflicts. Continuous loud roaring and colliding sounds echoed. The storm, having reached its peak, suddenly came to a standstill. The rolling black clouds vanished in an instant. Within the seven-colored arc of light, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profoundly mystical character was present! The moment the character appeared, the sounds of the highest Dao resonated through heaven and earth. Colorful auspicious clouds continuously arrived from the horizon, converging towards the character. Drizzling raindrops fell from the sky. The raindrops, like the auspicious clouds in the sky, were of a captivating seven-colored hue. The fissures in heaven and earth were repaired. The flames on the grassland were extinguished by the falling raindrops. The continuous green grass greedily absorbed the heavenly dew, but their bodies began to shrink. Seven-colored light brightened, and figures of various shapes began to form within. However, the sounds of fighting in the sky seemed to grow louder.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Yan Faju’s memory was nearing its end. The surrounding scenes gradually blurred, and only the lone stone on the grassland could be seen dissolving under the raindrops.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…The scene faded, and Li Fan returned to Yan Faju’s character light sphere. He was immersed in the scene he had just witnessed, unable to extricate himself. “How is it? Have you figured anything out?” Yan Faju asked expectantly. After savoring the scene for a long time, Li Fan finally asked, “That raindrop, could it be the Immortal Melody Jade Dew you mentioned?” Yan Faju stood with her hands on her hips, declaring righteously, “It should be. I’ve had this memory in my mind since I was born. But as I grew older, I forgot it. Thankfully, I had a good sleep earlier, otherwise, who knows when I would have remembered it!” “I have a feeling that if I could have some more of this stuff…” Li Fan interrupted Yan Faju’s reverie. “What about the characters in that seven-colored arc of light?” “Why can’t I see them clearly at all?” Yan Faju pouted, “I already told you it was from a dream. It’s already difficult enough for me to recall this, let alone remember the characters clearly?!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stared at Yan Faju, trying to discern the truth in her words. “You don’t believe me?” Yan Faju said, feeling extremely wronged. Li Fan chuckled, “You’re not stupid. I don’t believe you haven’t realized that the scene you just showed has a high probability of being a legendary Immortal Realm scene. Characters that even Immortals are fighting over… It’s natural for you to hide something.” Yan Faju’s expression became even more wronged upon hearing this. “I really can’t remember. You know they are Immortal characters, they aren’t easily remembered. Besides, I was so young back then…” Yan Faju gestured, tears welling up in her eyes. “How can I recall it?” Li Fan didn’t believe the little loli’s excuses and directly stated his condition. Yan Faju’s tears stopped instantly. Her big eyes darted around, as if deep in thought. After a moment, she whispered, “Hmm, maybe if I eat my fill, I can remember some things.” Yan Faju licked her lips and looked at Li Fan. “Eat?” Li Fan lowered his head, “You can eat too?” Yan Faju said indignantly, “What kind of question is that? I’m a person too, you know.” “It’s been thousands of years since I tasted good food.” “I tasted it again in my dream and got cravings…” Li Fan conjured a crispy roasted pigeon exuding an enticing aroma in his hand. “Is this acceptable?” Yan Faju rolled her eyes, “I want the real thing, not a fake. I can have as many of these as I want.” As she spoke, the little loli waved her hand, and the surroundings were instantly filled with all sorts of delicacies. “Even if it looks similar, a fake is still a fake and can never become real…” Yan Faju shook her head, filled with regret. “Oh?” For some reason, Yan Faju suddenly felt Li Fan’s expression change slightly at that moment. “Then take a look at this dish. What do you think?” In Li Fan’s hand appeared a seemingly ordinary fried rice. Yan Faju initially dismissed it, but at Li Fan’s subtle gesture, she took it and tasted it.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-287" class="calibre1">Chapter 1276: Arrest Mo Ruibin</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Initially, Yan Faju was somewhat cautious. But the moment she tasted it, her expression became incredibly vivid. She then began to devour it with large mouthfuls. "Wuwu... so delicious... wuwu..." In a flash, she finished the entire plate of fried rice. Afterward, she patted her slightly full stomach with a lingering sense of satisfaction, her face full of amazement. "Your fried rice is just like the real thing! How did you do it?" With that, Yan Faju let out a satisfied burp.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled and replied, "When the fake becomes real, the real also becomes fake. When the real becomes fake, the fake also becomes real. Truth and falsehood, how can they be so easily distinguished?" "As long as you have sufficient understanding of the essence of things, you too can create things that are incredibly lifelike." Yan Faju plopped down on the ground. "Fried rice, I've only ever eaten it, never made it! Delicious food in general, it seems there's no hope of self-sufficiency. But..." She eyed Li Fan. "Were you perhaps a chef before?" Li Fan’s face twitched. He avoided the question and changed the subject. "Are you full yet? Have you remembered those immortal characters?" Yan Faju quickly shook her head. "Just one dish, it's not enough! Can I have some more!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"From the clues we have now, True Immortal Seal Scripts can be divided into three major categories. The first is the 'Chaos' script, which brings all sorts of disasters and destruction. The second is the 'Return' script, which is a decree from the Immortal Realm. And the last is this..." As he sensed it, Mo Rubin, who had been fleeing rapidly before, had been motionless for a long time. Li Fan's thoughts churned, and he couldn't help but try to piece together the missing Dao inscription characters again. Li Fan responded indifferently, "It was just a small trade I did with that skill when I was a mortal. Not worth mentioning." "However..." Li Ping pondered for a moment, not pursuing directly. Instead, he summoned the Master Craftsman.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Li Fan's true body gained insight from Yan Faju's recounting of the Immortal Realm's secrets, the Faceless Saint Emperor Li Ping finally completed the final sealing of the Faceless True Immortal statue and the First Origin Sect ruins.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But everything is afraid of comparison." And as the strokes in the character light sphere moved, a giant character, occupying the entire sky, was formed. Li Fan snorted coldly, but still waved his hand gently. A stove, cooking utensils, and ingredients appeared before him. But Li Fan discovered that this gap only appeared when he presented and compared the two simultaneously in his mind. "You know, although you're not very good-looking, your cooking skills are really superb," Yan Faju praised. "The difference between the original and the replica is truly immense." Amidst the dancing cooking flames, various delicious dishes emitting fragrant aromas were continuously served. "The structure of the strokes, the style of the turns, and all sorts of pen tip details are extremely similar to what I saw before with 'Hunger' and 'Chaos,' but it's even more beautiful, even more naturally integrated." He then said, "Hmm, I'm a little sleepy, I'm going to take a nap. You can look yourself." Yan Faju, who had just eaten her fill, her stomach round like a ball, ungracefully lay directly on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's a pity that this 'Inscription Dao Immortal' original is incomplete. And after being passed through Yan Faju's memory, it's still a little distorted." Imitating the 'Inscription Dao Immortal' original, Li Fan re-examined the True Immortal Seal Scripts like 'Hunger' and 'Chaos' that he had mastered. Saying that, Yan Faju was already snoring loudly and had fallen into a deep sleep. Yan Faju squinted contentedly, savoring the taste lingering on her tongue. As expected, the effect was excellent. Although at first glance, they still looked the same as before, Li Fan was very sure that these True Immortal Seal Scripts, improved based on the original, had their power increased by at least one-third. The profound Daoist sounds he had vaguely heard in the illusion before seemed to ring out again. Li Fan looked up at the character, motionless, and only after it slowly dissipated did he show a thoughtful expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Where is this place... According to legend, it's the heart of that giant beast transformed after death, where the Qi of the Nine Mountains Prefecture converges. I went there once, but found nothing special," the Master Craftsman said, shaking his head slightly while sensing the image transmitted by the Saint Emperor. The location pointed out by the Saint Emperor was a swamp in the Nine Mountains Prefecture, the stronghold of the Spiritual Yuan Sect. "It's just that the spiritual energy is denser than in other places, there's nothing else special about it," the Master Craftsman concluded. "What do you know about that [Tian Beast]?" Li Ping asked again. The Master Craftsman shrugged. "If it weren't for some local cultivators from the Nine Mountains Prefecture in my sect, I probably wouldn't even know the legend that the Nine Mountains were formed from the corpse of a dead giant beast. So that thing is called a Tian Beast, I've learned something new." "However, if you're interested in that place, I have an Nascent Soul cultivator in my sect named Shen Yurou. You can summon him to ask." The Master Craftsman explained the reason to Li Ping. It turned out that Shen Yurou's family had been making a living by excavating underground objects in the Nine Mountains Prefecture for generations. In the chaotic land of the Nine Mountains, countless cultivators had been buried since ancient times. It could even be traced back to the era when the Ten Immortal Sects ruled. Relying on this craft, the Shen family had accumulated considerable wealth. However, it was ultimately a shady business. Since Shen Yurou joined the Spiritual Yuan Sect, he had abandoned this ancestral skill.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I think I heard him mention before that Shen's ancestor once dug up a peculiar building near that swamp. But inside, it was empty, with only some strange statues placed there. After his ancestor left in disappointment, he fell gravely ill and almost died." Li Ping's heart stirred, and he flipped through the Creation Stone Tablet. Indeed, he found information about this Shen family ancestor, but there was no record of discovering ruins in the Nine Mountains Prefecture swamp. Li Ping then left Great Qi and went to the Spiritual Yuan Sect. Still disguised as the Sect Master of the Spiritual Yuan Sect, he summoned Shen Yurou to inquire about the details. Shen Yurou was somewhat taken aback by the summons from the Sect Master who had not appeared for a long time. He said nervously, "This matter is indeed somewhat strange. After my ancestor accidentally entered that place, he contracted some strange illness." "For example, the scene of that underground building often reappears in his dreams, and also..." "Since then, all members of our Shen family have become like men when they are women, and like women when they are men. The balance of yin and yang is reversed," Shen Yurou said, seemingly having accepted reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping scanned Shen Yurou's body with his divine sense, but found no influence of any foreign power. It was as if it was meant to be like this. "Is the specific location of that building still preserved?" Li Ping asked. Shen Yurou's face showed distress. "My ancestor, to prevent any clan member from accidentally entering again, did not reveal its specific location. However, the scene of that building has been preserved through paintings and calligraphy." With that, Shen Yurou conjured a painting in the air. At the four corners, there were stone statues. It depicted a headless person in different postures, as if praying. In the center of the four stone statues stood a bare, smooth pillar. The surface of the pillar was smooth, without any carved patterns. Strangely, the shadow cast by the pillar on the ground seemed to be that of a ferocious beast, baring its fangs and claws, as if it would come alive with the change of light and shadow.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to my ancestor, inside this building, there was a constant, intense heartbeat sound. And if you looked up along the pillar, it was like suddenly falling into an abyss, surrounded by endless darkness..." Shen Yurou added. Li Ping stared at the headless figures in the painting. Even without heads, they vaguely resembled the style of the Faceless True Immortal statue he had encountered beneath Mount Taixu. It was undoubtedly a product of the Xuan Heaven Sect. "Borrowing its image, yet severing its head." "This pillar..." The smooth pillar was undoubtedly the core of this strange building. But from the image alone, no clues could be discerned. After Li Ping dismissed Shen Yurou, he quietly arrived at the Great Marsh in the Nine Mountains Prefecture. The presence of such a vast swampland in the continuously rolling Nine Mountains was theoretically highly unreasonable. Many cultivators had explored this area, hoping to uncover some secrets, but all had found nothing. Li Ping stood in the center of the Great Marsh, only sensing a foul and decaying odor. He did not detect anything unusual. If it weren't for the clear sensation that Mo Rubin was hiding here. Mo Rubin had seemingly not yet detected Li Ping's approach. Although he had been moving within the depths of the swamp in a small area, he had never left this region.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Setting up formations around, Li Ping infiltrated the underground of the swamp, slowly approaching the sensed location. "Gulp..." Suddenly, his movements halted abruptly. Just now, Li Ping vaguely heard a squirming sound. With his current cultivation level, it was almost impossible to dismiss it as an illusion. So... Li Ping looked around. The viscous, foul-smelling swamp mud was rhythmically churning, as if alive. Li Ping suddenly had a feeling that the entire swamp had suddenly come alive. "A trap?" The thought flashed through Li Ping's mind, but he quickly dismissed it. The attention of this swamp was not on him. The Saint Emperor continued to conceal his tracks, following the internal sensation, which was also the source of the swamp's life-like movement. Before long, he discovered the strange building that Shen Yurou's ancestor had encountered. Viewed from a macroscopic perspective, this building resembled a blank face. And the tall, smooth pillar was located at the position of the eyebrows of the blank face, as if a third eye protruding from the ground, gazing at the sky. This bizarre sight made Li Ping's heart tighten. The building isolated him from peering inside, so he could only rely on the imprint he had left on Mo Rubin to confirm that he was currently busy doing something inside. The Saint Emperor did not rashly enter. Instead, from the periphery, he silently laid out a net of Origin Force Essence. Combined with layers of formations to completely seal the area, and summoning the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao to seal the surrounding earth veins... Even after taking so many precautions, Li Ping inexplicably felt uncertain. After pondering for a moment, Li Ping awakened Cat Treasure on his shoulder and retrieved an item from its belly. It was obtained from the fishing pond, a treasure that could seal space. The treasure looked unremarkable, just a simple ring. But the golden-white light flowing on it subtly revealed the terrifying power hidden within. "Void Binding Ring." "It was forged by integrating a ring-shaped world, extinguishing all life within it, and incorporating it into the ring. Not only does it possess the weight of the entire world, but also the weight of billions of lives. Once bound, even I would be greatly affected in my movements." Although the forging method could be considered a downright evil method, Li Ping was not a pedantic person, so he had no psychological burden in using it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He gently tossed it out, and the Void Binding Ring flew towards the top of the void-faced building. In the blink of an eye, it expanded several times, enveloping the entire surrounding area. Watching the gradually disappearing golden-white ring, the Saint Emperor pondered for a moment, then laid down a final measure. With everything ready, Li Ping flew into the building. "You've arrived." "I've been waiting for you for a long time." As soon as he entered, Mo Rubin's voice echoed in his ears. Li Ping focused his gaze, unable to see his person. But the shadow lingering at the base of the smooth pillar in the center of the building seemed to take on a humanoid form. Facing Li Ping, it appeared to wear a mocking expression. "I've been by Brother Xuanyuan's side for so long, even if I haven't reached the Half-Immortal realm, I wouldn't know nothing about him. Moreover, you're using a plan that my brother discarded and rejected..." "Mortal Immortal Force, powerful though it may be, is ultimately harmful and not beneficial," Mo Rubin taunted. Li Ping knew that the Mortal Immortal Force Mo Rubin spoke of was the Origin Force Essence he had condensed from the faith of the You Clan. Taking shortcuts would surely come at a price. But what he sought was not ascension to immortality, but the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth. Within the scope of what he could achieve, finding the most powerful force was not inappropriate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ignoring Mo Rubin's words, the Saint Emperor examined the details of the building. "A relic of the Xuan Heaven Sect?" he asked. Mo Rubin seemed to be waiting for something and did not attack. He replied, "Hehehe, rather than saying it's a relic of the Xuan Heaven Sect, it's more like my personal backup plan." "Brother Xuanyuan is too idealistic, and too confident in himself." "I am different." The shadow beneath the pillar seemed to be stimulated by something and began to circle more rapidly. "I once had the same mindset as Brother Xuanyuan, thinking I was the destined protagonist and that failure was impossible as long as I acted. But later, I was severely struck, and my cultivation regressed daily. I even had to face ridicule from those I previously disdained..." "I realized!" Mo Rubin's shadow suddenly surged from the ground, floating in mid-air, glaring fiercely at Li Ping. "I am not some protagonist. I am merely an insignificant figure flowing through the river of history in this world. Small figures naturally need to pave the way for failure. That's why I secretly built this place behind Brother Xuanyuan's back!" Mo Rubin manifested shadowy arms and pointed at the four headless stone statues around him, laughing sinisterly. "Look at these statues." "They are True Immortals, and they even saved Brother Xuanyuan's life. The people in the sect, including Brother Xuanyuan himself, admired them greatly, yet I still severed their heads!" Mo Rubin's maniacal laughter echoed throughout the secret chamber.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping calmly said, "Aren't you afraid of retaliation from the True Immortals?" Mo Rubin laughed even more fiercely. "You completely misunderstand! Let alone severing their heads, even if I urinated and defecated on their statues, the True Immortals wouldn't care!" "Mortal affairs, how can they enter the eyes of True Immortals?! Immortal..." "They only care about what they care about!" Li Ping just listened silently, neither agreeing nor refuting. "I know that immortal power, as if the True Immortals themselves have descended, is indeed immense, but even True Immortals do not have infinite power. Why would they waste their power on such a small statue?" Mo Rubin laughed heartily, then slowly calmed down. "Unless..." "Something that True Immortals care about appears around the statue." Before he finished speaking, the shadow Mo Rubin transformed into retreated back into the smooth pillar. The ground of the building vibrated slightly, and the pillar began to emit a faint glow, as if something was gestating within.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I don't know who you are. But I'll give you a piece of advice..." Mo Rubin's voice came from within the pillar, becoming unclear as if passing through layers of obstruction. "Unless absolutely necessary, do not enter the True Immortal realm!" Li Ping vaguely sensed that the four headless statues around him seemed to have come alive. Even though their heads were severed, they could still gaze at the scene. However, their gazes were not on Li Ping. They were all focused on the glowing pillar. Logically, even if it wasn't the True Immortals' power directly descending, but merely a gaze transmitted across countless space-time distances, mortal cultivators should not be able to bear it. But the Faceless Saint Emperor, within the four statues, felt no pressure at all. "Is the power being drawn and absorbed?" Li Ping's heart trembled slightly. In his sight, four streams of power of the same nature were intertwined into threads, all circling the smooth pillar, wrapping around it layer by layer. Energized by this great power, the pillar's light grew brighter and brighter. Its surface seemed to melt away, revealing its true form. "This is..." A bare flagpole. The banner had long since disappeared, leaving only a white jade pole carved with complex patterns. "An item from the Immortal Realm." Feeling the increasingly violent energy fluctuations around him, Li Ping retreated slightly, but his gaze remained firmly locked on the white jade flagpole.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not only the gaze of the True Immortal statues, but even the Mortal Immortal Force, the Origin Force Essence I laid out, are being subtly manipulated by this flagpole..." At this moment, Mo Rubin's voice sounded again. "Back then, when Brother Xuanyuan returned from the Immortal Realm, he brought back quite a few good things." "Not to mention those cultivation techniques, even Immortal Artifacts were plentiful..." "It's a pity that they said they were tainted by calamity, and most of them were sealed, preventing us from using them." Energy formed a tangible vortex around the spirit banner, and amidst continuous tremors, the flagpole seemed as if it would break through the void and depart at any moment. "Alright, I haven't spoken to anyone in many years, and I've finally felt comfortable speaking so much." "We'll see each other again if there's a chance." "I have important business to attend to." Mo Rubin's words slowly faded. Brilliant light erupted from the flagpole, obscuring all prying eyes. The next moment, the spirit banner was about to escape this place. But Li Ping, who had been tracking for so long, naturally wouldn't let him leave just because of a few words. The formations and the net of Origin Force Essence exploded, and golden interweaving threads appeared from the void, forming a tight, inescapable net before the flagpole, completely sealing off space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mortal Immortal Force, dare to contend with true immortal power?!" Mo Rubin's mocking voice echoed. Under the scorching light at the front of the white jade flagpole, the golden Origin Force slowly melted like snow. Li Ping remained unfazed, using his remaining Origin Force Essence like moths to a flame, while activating the formations to intercept. "Mortal formations, do they deserve..." "Huh?!" Mo Rubin's voice showed surprise for the first time. Because the formations Li Ping displayed had far surpassed his understanding. They were even slowly pulling back the white jade flagpole, which was about to pierce through the void. In Mo Rubin's senses, the surroundings were filled with obstructive media, hindering the flagpole's progress. "The formations of the Xuanhuang Realm have developed to this extent?" "The level of refinement is actually not inferior to the Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation!" Although shocked, Mo Rubin did not slow down his departure. A beam of white light erupted again from the flagpole. The white light swept across, and everything in front of it was dissolved. The flagpole then easily broke free from the heavy obstructions. And for some reason, Mo Rubin stopped his mockery and remained silent as he wanted to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Command!" At this moment, Li Ping's cold voice rang out. The Void Binding Ring manifested in the void, firmly locking the white jade flagpole. "Useless! Useless! Useless! Just a mere world artifact!" "Damn it! You're like a fly, so annoying!" Mo Rubin's tone was clearly different from before. He rambled on, even seeming a bit deranged. For the first time, something other than white light appeared from within the white jade flagpole. It was a human silhouette. The figure held a long saber and elegantly slashed towards the Void Binding Ring. *Clang!* The golden-white ring, containing the weight of billions of lives and an entire cultivation world, cracked from the middle. However, releasing the white figure had clearly consumed a lot of the white jade flagpole's energy. Its radiance dimmed considerably. "Damn it, damn it, damn it..." Mo Rubin's poisonous curses echoed. But he did not stay to trouble Li Ping. Instead, he resolutely continued towards his predetermined destination. "I told you, you can't stop me!" With a flash of light, the white jade flagpole transformed into a fine thread, breaking free from all restraints and was about to leave. At this moment, an ancient song suddenly rang out. The sound was not loud, but it suppressed the vibrations of Mo Rubin and the white jade flagpole. A pitch-black gate quietly opened in the path of the white jade flagpole. And Li Ping, who had not acted personally, also appeared at the tail of the white jade flagpole at this moment. Protected by golden armor, the phantom image of the Xuanhuang Realm also appeared behind the Saint Emperor. "Go in!" *Boom! Boom! Boom!* Li Ping fiercely kicked the tail of the white jade flagpole, causing the flagpole, which was already in a hurry to leave, to shoot forward. Unable to dodge, it flew directly into the pitch-black gate. Li Ping also flew in immediately afterward, closing the passage. He even casually brought along the few loyal You Clan members who had risked their lives to perform the ritual and open the passage to the Dark Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Dark Sea. It was pitch black and silent. Even in the outside world, the white jade flagpole, which shone like the sun, could only illuminate a small, limited area here. And Mo Rubin, who had been so noisy before, was now as silent as a mute. After a long pause. "Wait, where is this..." "This place..." After a long time, he finally spoke dazedly. "Now, we can talk." The radiance of the white jade flagpole slightly dispelled the darkness of the Dark Sea, allowing Li Ping and Mo Rubin to communicate verbally for the time being. Mo Rubin, however, seemed to have not heard Li Ping's words at all. He emerged from the white jade flagpole, looking around with disbelief. His expression was a mixture of anticipation and fear. "Is there the aura of Xuan Tianwang here?" After a brief silence, Li Ping spoke. The words "Xuan Tianwang" seemed to have triggered a switch. Mo Rubin suddenly snapped back to reality. He stared at Li Ping. "How did you know about this place?" "And how can you open the passage here?" Mo Rubin's tone was very dangerous, as if if Li Ping's answer was slightly wrong, he would fight to the death. "Nearly ten thousand years have passed since you fell into slumber. Nothing is impossible." Li Ping's attitude was very calm. "Not only me, but even the current largest cultivation organization, the Myriad Immortals Alliance, has mastered the method of opening passages here." "And they are stealing power here." "Don't you feel it?" Li Ping asked. As soon as these words were spoken, Mo Rubin's expression changed again. He looked towards the distance, his aura fluctuating violently. "How dare they?!" "It deserves death! Kill! Kill!" Mo Rubin roared in rage.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-288" class="calibre1">Chapter 1277: The Dark Sea Hides a True Immortal</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A killing intent, as tangible as substance, swept towards the Saint Emperor, only to be dissolved into nothingness by the faint golden threads before him. Once Mo Rubin's rage subsided somewhat, Li Ping spoke calmly, "I can tell your inner heart isn't truly angry." "Are you still acting before me? Or once you get into character, even you can hardly distinguish?" "Look, true anger is like this..." The Saint Emperor took a sudden step forward, powerful energy erupting from his toes and sweeping outwards. The radiance of the white jade flagpole swayed precariously in the wind. But this surging energy, once it left the confines of the light sphere and entered the murky depths, rapidly weakened. The silent Dark Sea rippled faintly, smoothing out all disturbances. As if comforting the enraged Saint Emperor. "I don't need you to teach me! I understand this place better than you!" Mo Rubin's figure suddenly flickered behind Li Ping. A shadow hid beneath the white light of the white jade flagpole, like a venomous snake, baring its fangs at Li Ping's neck. The chattering of the demonic face continued. "I once tried to harness the power of the Dark Sea to close that gap, but was blocked by an eyeball..." "With such a group of insects dragging me down, how can I succeed?" "Is the owner of that eyeball Xuan Tianwang?" "Would Brother Xuanyuan do such a thing?" Their tone varied, but without exception, after speaking their lines, they spontaneously dissolved into the Dark Sea. "Those who act, let them act. Those who are extremely terrified, let them be deterred to the end. Those who are utterly wicked, let them wallow in the mire." He suddenly stopped and looked up at the distant sky. "Damn it." "Don't I know that the Dark Sea encompasses everything, that even a cultivator's emotions will create ripples that are then covered by the darkness?" "Daring to speak so boldly with just some opportunistic method?" Li Ping looked at the shadow bound and writhing in his hand, and said coldly, "Another personality? This one... is very much like you." Li Ping also didn't get angry and followed his words, asking, "Then why could that eyeball mobilize the power of the Dark Sea?" Since these demonic faces did not attack, Li Ping directly ignored them and their taunts, quickly approaching Mo Rubin. Mo Rubin's direction of travel seemed to be the rift through which the Myriad Immortals Alliance was drawing power from the Dark Sea. The Saint Emperor came to Mo Rubin's side, placed his hand on his shoulder, and transmitted his voice. His gaze seemed to pierce through layers of darkness. Not far ahead, on Mo Rubin's true face, there was a calmness identical to his own. The waves of the Dark Sea blocked Mo Rubin's progress. "As expected, how foolish." Mo Rubin sneered. "The formation is just a facade. What truly makes this darkness gather, allowing the Xuanhuang Realm to resist the suction from the ruins of the ascension passage, is..." "Wield the demonic face with an immortal heart, and display the appropriate demeanor for whatever you encounter!" However, Mo Rubin himself discarded the immortal artifact, the white jade flagpole. Taking advantage of this moment of conversation, he had already vanished from his original spot. Mo Rubin did not look back, but a face suddenly appeared on the back of his head, looking at Li Ping with utter contempt. Then, the Saint Emperor showed no emotional fluctuation. Another shadow face appeared above Li Ping. This time, the words were no longer like the previous mad ramblings. However, Li Ping could hear true killing intent hidden within the calmness. Li Ping shook his head slightly; that kick he gave earlier was not for nothing. "What is the true me again? I am the number one genius of the Nine Revolutions, the first person to achieve immortality who carries the hopes of all. I am also one of the Twelve Dharma Kings of the Xuan Tian Sect, assisting Xuanyuan Hong in building the great cause of the Xuan Tian Sect and unifying the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Ping's golden armor suddenly showed cracks, and a black line shot out from the central hole, heading straight for Li Ping's neck. *Whoosh...* Mo Rubin's face on the back of his head disappeared: "Do you know what the essence of this Dark Sea is?" "You see through my heart too?" But just as it was about to succeed, Li Ping blocked it with his palm. A gap rhythmically spewed dark energy outwards. The intermittent muffled sounds were like a heavy heartbeat. After saying this, instead of crushing this sneak attack directly, he let it return to Mo Rubin's side. Dozens of Mo Rubin's faces hid in the darkness, occasionally floating over and mocking Li Ping. "Who do you think you are?! You haven't even entered the Immortal realm, and you dare to dream of saving the world?!" "Wrong, wrong, wrong! Laughter and scolding are me, arrogance and unrestrainedness are me, wildness is also me!" "As for pedantic good people like you, they should be scathingly awakened!" "Formation?" After pondering for a moment, Li Ping replied. Dozens of faces differentiated around him, unleashing a torrent of extremely unpleasant words upon the Saint Emperor. "Even so, must I always show the same face? The chief genius should always be steady? The Twelve Dharma Kings should always plan and then move?" Following the residual senses, he rapidly advanced through the Dark Sea, chasing Mo Rubin. At a crucial point, Mo Rubin suddenly stopped. "Do you want to know?" he asked teasingly, his tone frivolous. "Yes." Li Ping replied frankly. Seeing Li Ping so serious, Mo Rubin suddenly seemed to lose interest. His tone instantly returned to normal. "Only the power of a True Immortal can contend with Immortal power." "The one who caused the cataclysm of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea was a True Immortal who attained enlightenment. Then, the one who could generate enough momentum for the Xuanhuang Realm to escape..." "Naturally, it must be another True Immortal." As soon as these words were spoken, they struck Li Ping's mind like thunder. The surrounding darkness seemed to come alive in an instant, all peering at him. "True Immortals are indeed True Immortals." "But they are dead True Immortals. Correct?" However, the Saint Emperor, who had suddenly learned such a secret, seemed to have already anticipated it. He calmly retorted, "Mo Rubin shrugged: "Talking to smart people like you is really boring." "The foundation of the entire Dark Sea is the corpse of a True Immortal." "It's amazing, isn't it? Such a lower realm actually has a True Immortal who died here. But fortunately, the Xuanhuang Realm hid the corpse of a True Immortal, otherwise, even Xuanyuan wouldn't have had any good methods to save the Xuanhuang Realm if he had no ingredients for a clever cook." Mo Rubin sighed with emotion. Li Ping, however, introduced the existence of the Fallen Immortal Realm to Mo Rubin. "Oh. I didn't expect there to be a successor Heavenly Venerate willing to share the legacy of a True Immortal with the world." Mo Rubin's aura became unstable again after hearing this. "Hard to imagine there are people in this world even more foolish than Brother Xuanyuan. Truly..." "He has already perished." Li Ping added. Mo Rubin turned around and stared blankly at Li Ping. "You ask me, who should I ask? Probably not dead. I'm also looking for him. Brother Xuanyuan, who is so powerful, even if ambushed by a villain, he wouldn't just die like this." Saying this, without giving Li Ping a chance to communicate further, he turned back. "The Dark Sea is built upon the corpse of a True Immortal, gathering Dark Immortal power to resist the Immortal Ruins." "However, it is merely a dead object. Once the core manipulator is gone, it has become nourishment for others." "So, don't die. Even if you were a True Immortal in life, what good is it after death? Ants can still trample on you." Mo Rubin looked again at the Myriad Immortals Alliance's device drawing power from the Dark Sea, his tone mocking. "The First Generation Grand Heavenly Venerate's bloodline?" Li Ping's mind flashed with the strange appearance of the You Clan, and his heart stirred. "No wonder, only these people can communicate with the Dark Sea. But..." The direct bloodline of a True Immortal, without thinking, one knew how noble it was. But now they had become like this, neither human nor ghost. Mo Rubin seemed to have seen through Li Ping's thoughts and said coldly, "There's no need to pity these people. If you had lived in that era and personally experienced how the Grand Heavenly Venerate bloodline enslaved others..." "You would probably be the first to rise up in rebellion." "If Brother Xuanyuan hadn't intervened back then and wiped out all their claws and teeth, who knows how long these 'superior' beings would have continued to act atrociously. It can be considered their good fortune to have become this way now." Mo Rubin sneered coldly. Li Ping did not bother to argue with him on this issue. "The Dark Sea is actually using the corpse of a True Immortal to condense Dark Immortal power and resist the Immortal Ruins. Then, what is that eye held by the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" he asked softly. "Immortal Ruins..." As if disagreeing with this term, Mo Rubin let out another cold laugh. However, he did not dwell on these minor details this time and directly answered Li Ping's question: "That's just a magical artifact refined by Brother Xuanyuan back then to control the Dark Sea. After all, he couldn't possibly watch over this place all the time, and the Dark Sea was too important in the overall escape plan, so he asked us to assist. There were three in total, each given to different Dharma Kings." "I just don't know whose it is in the hands of the Myriad Immortals Alliance." A murderous intent flashed in Mo Rubin's words. Li Ping nodded slightly: "Is there a way to influence the eye artifact's control over the Dark Sea?" "If your formation mastery is even higher than Brother Xuanyuan's..." "Huh?" Mo Rubin was about to speak mockingly, but suddenly remembered the formation level displayed by the Saint Emperor during their previous encounter. He swallowed the words he was about to say. "Perhaps we can try in the core center of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation." Mo Rubin said. He shifted his gaze from the rift in the Dark Sea to another direction. Li Ping followed his gaze and sighed with emotion, "This formation is truly wondrous. I consider my formation skills to be extraordinary, but in this darkness, I cannot discern any trace of formation." "That's the effect of the True Immortal's corpse." Mo Rubin bluntly pointed out Li Ping's mistake: "Without the dispersing power of the True Immortal's corpse, you should be able to do it." The Saint Emperor was speechless. "Follow me." Mo Rubin beckoned, then vaguely oriented himself and disappeared into the darkness like a black line. Li Ping followed closely. As they got closer to the core of the so-called Dark Sea, Li Ping inexplicably felt a sense of unease. Vague images even flashed through his mind. Among them, Mo Rubin's empty shell lay quietly in this Dark Sea. "Wait!" A shiver ran down Li Ping's spine, and he called out to Mo Rubin. "Huh?" Although unhappy, Mo Rubin still stopped for the time being. "You better have a real reason. " Li Ping ignored his attitude and pondered for a moment, then said, "What kind of power can instantly kill you?" As if hearing an extremely funny joke, faces flew out from Mo Rubin's body and came before Li Ping, shouting loudly. "Instantly kill me? As long as the Demonic Heart is not destroyed and the Immortal Body is not extinguished, as long as one personality remains, I will not truly die!" "Even a True Immortal..." "A True Immortal should be able to do it." Mo Rubin's true body suddenly spoke, and the noisy faces instantly quieted down. "Actually, with Brother Xuanyuan's strength, under a planned ambush, he could also achieve it." Mo Rubin's true body analyzed rationally. "I feel like the formation ahead is a bit off." After hearing Mo Rubin's conclusion, Li Ping directly expressed his worry. Unexpectedly, this time Mo Rubin did not refute. He suddenly said something seemingly irrelevant: "The entire Dark Sea is built on the corpse of a True Immortal." "In our era, it was far less vast than it is now. It seems the Grand Heavenly Venerate bloodline has multiplied well over the years." "Hmm... although it has shrunk a bit recently, it doesn't affect the overall situation." "To gather spirits to ascend, and ascend to gather spirits. In fact, this place can also be seen as the masterless corpse of a True Immortal that has been cultivating for nearly ten thousand years. It's filled with pure True Immortal power." "It's just that... these True Immortal powers were cultivated from the remains of a True Immortal. So theoretically, only that deceased True Immortal can use them." "Theoretically." Mo Rubin repeated these three words. "But there are countless miraculous techniques in the world, who knows if there's a method to break this restriction." The Faceless Saint Emperor gazed into the boundless Dark Sea: "Such immense power, if it could be controlled. It might instantly erupt with power comparable to a True Immortal." "A child carrying a cauldron, and the result will be crushed to death by the cauldron." Mo Rubin shattered Li Ping's fantasy. He continued walking towards the core of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation. "I'm wondering if it's possible that Brother Xuanyuan hid here after being severely injured." "If there is anyone in the Xuanhuang Realm who is most likely to absorb the power of this Dark Sea, it would undoubtedly be him." As if talking to himself, or explaining to Li Ping why he insisted on going there despite the danger. "It's fine, with me by your side, the two of us working together, even if we encounter danger, escaping will not be a problem." Li Ping said frankly, following closely behind. "What an idiot. So I say, good people die quickly." Mo Rubin ridiculed Li Ping's good intentions as if he didn't appreciate them. Li Ping's attention was focused on his surroundings. The darkness gathered here, becoming thicker and thicker. Knowing that this darkness was the power of a True Immortal's corpse, Li Ping felt a completely different sensation than before while being within it. However, what surprised him was that Cat Treasure, who was usually very greedy for immortal-grade energy, seemed to not sense such immense power at all. It was still sleeping soundly on his shoulder. It hadn't even opened its eyes. "Interesting." Li Ping increased his vigilance in his heart. Not long after, Mo Rubin stopped. "It should be here." He looked around and said. "Should be?" Li Ping was a little confused. Such indecisive words should not have come from Mo Rubin, a Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect. "Someone has been here before. And modified the formation." Mo Rubin's tone became unprecedentedly solemn. Li Ping also heard a hint of anticipation and excitement in it. However, after looking around, he looked back at Li Ping. "This formation is a bit complex." The implication was that he needed the Saint Emperor's help. Li Ping shook his head slightly: "The power of the True Immortal's corpse permeates everywhere, I cannot sense any trace of the formation." Mo Rubin snorted: "Watch this!" A shadow face instantly flew out from him and towards Li Ping. Li Ping felt no malice, so he did not dodge. This shadow demonic face of Mo Rubin moved maliciously and attached itself to Li Ping's blank face. Before he could express his displeasure, Li Ping was attracted by the spectacular scene that suddenly lit up before him. The dark and silent Dark Sea suddenly shed its mysterious veil. Revealing its true appearance. Like thick clouds accumulated in the sky, evolving into different forms. The dark power gathered piece by piece. Li Ping and Mo Rubin seemed to be in the sky, in a kingdom of clouds. The aggregates of dark power moved slowly yet very quickly. As they approached each other, they swallowed one another and transformed into new shapes. And in the very center of this Dark Sea, the oldest dark clouds that had been settling for tens of thousands of years emitted an aura that made Li Ping's heart tremble. These ancient aggregates were like terrifying ancient beasts, quietly residing in the depths of the Dark Sea. "As expected of the power of a True Immortal. The energy contained in each of these cloud clusters, if unleashed, would far exceed the full power attack of a Lifespan realm cultivator." "What greatness!" Li Ping exclaimed in admiration. Li Ping also noticed that the Myriad Immortals Alliance's device for drawing power from the Dark Sea was actually absorbing the scattered clouds floating in various parts of the Dark Sea. Moreover, the Myriad Immortals Alliance seemed to be able to distinguish between the sizes of the clouds, not daring to provoke the larger aggregates. Their targets were mostly small, scattered individuals. "Now you can see it clearly, right?" Mo Rubin's voice interrupted Li Ping's thoughts. Li Ping snapped back to his senses and looked around again. Indeed, traces of formations were found around these aggregates. However, before he could start deciphering them, Li Ping asked a question. "The Great Ascension Star Crossing Formation, in my previous deductions, was composed of four sub-formations." "The golden chain used to lock onto and capture cultivation worlds outside the Star Sea; the Eye of the Sky Beast acting as an observation post; the Dark Sea used to escape the suction of the Immortal Ruins, which is the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation. What is the last one?" Using Mo Rubin's demonic face, Li Ping stared intently at Mo Rubin's true form. Mo Rubin shrugged: "How would I know? The Grand Ascension Formation was almost entirely built by Brother Xuanyuan himself. We only had the chance to closely examine it after he completed its construction. Different Dharma Kings were responsible for different areas. I'm just somewhat familiar with this place." Li Ping found no flaws in Mo Rubin's words. However, he did not easily believe him. Putting aside this issue for now, Li Ping focused on analyzing the formation here. After all, he truly wanted to meet the legendary Xuan Tianwang himself. "The formation is old, and its style differs from those passed down in the Xuanhuang Realm." "It seems there are traces of it being activated. Did a battle occur here?" "It can only be considered an anomaly. It's not particularly complex, not even close to the threshold of immortal-grade formations." Li Ping concluded after observing for a while. "Will casting spells here cause the dark power to riot?" Li Ping asked Mo Rubin cautiously before breaking the formation. Mo Rubin, as expected, sneered: "Are you already at the True Immortal realm? Don't worry about these trivialities." "If you could cause the True Immortal power here to riot, the first thing I would do is run away immediately." With Mo Rubin's assurance, Li Ping had no more reservations. Hidden formation patterns were arranged before his eyes, interlocking and decomposing. In a short time, Li Ping found the flaw in this formation. "Go this way." Leading the way, without triggering the formation's counteraction. "So smooth, you actually have some skill." Mo Rubin also rarely praised him. The scene within the formation seemed no different from before entering. However, from Mo Rubin's expression, they had not taken a wrong turn. "This is the original core formation of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation." Following Mo Rubin's words, Li Ping scanned his surroundings. The ancient aggregates of dark power from the outside were absorbed here. They turned into wisps of blue smoke and disappeared. "No remnant True Immortal power, the essence of the energy is deeper within the formation." Li Ping mused. "The power section of the Ascension Formation, once sealed, cannot be re-entered. But the main control area is not sealed." "Be careful." Mo Rubin skillfully continued to move deeper inside. Li Ping, however, walked slowly while observing his surroundings, committing all the details of the formation to memory. Although only a small part of the formation was exposed, with his current formation level, he could infer the origin of the formation by observing a small part. "Interesting, there are traces of battle." Mo Rubin, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped. He looked at a corner of the formation. Li Ping also discerned a sword light from the slightly damaged traces of the formation. "Lifespan Realm." Li Ping judged, immediately becoming vigilant. "And not a weak Lifespan Realm." Mo Rubin added. Saying this, he quickened his pace and continued inward. From a visual perspective, their positions seemed unchanged. The ancient aggregates above, below, and all around remained still relative to them. But Li Ping could clearly feel that even with the boost from Mo Rubin's demonic face, the surrounding environment was becoming darker. "Depths of the Dark Sea." The familiar, all-encompassing darkness returned, making it more suffocating than the outer darkness. Li Ping even felt that the operation of his cultivation was being hindered, and even Origin Force Essence could not escape it. When the darkness swallowed the last trace of light, and Li Ping could only sense the surrounding scene with the help of Mo Rubin's demonic face, he suddenly felt Mo Rubin stop his actions. A cold aura was faintly transmitted. Li Ping slowly approached and discovered the reason for Mo Rubin's stillness. Not far ahead, a skeleton lay quietly. Or perhaps, a hollow shell would be a more appropriate description. I don't know how long it has been dead, but its appearance is still lifelike, and the look of horror and disbelief on its face before death can be clearly seen. And although its body seemed full, it was actually empty inside. Nothing remained. "Lifespan Realm." Mo Rubin communicated with Li Ping through the attached demonic face. "And the clothes on him look a bit familiar." Mo Rubin suddenly felt a surge of killing intent. "Dao Sect's Fang Dingge." After observing carefully for a while, Li Ping identified the person from the records of the Creation Stone Tablet. "So it's here." Li Ping suddenly realized. At the same time, his vigilance rose to an unprecedented level. "Who is it?" Mo Rubin asked concisely. "The Sect Master of the Great Dao Sect during the great calamity thousands of years after your era." "In pursuit of the Law Transmitter, the creator of the current Myriad Immortals Alliance, six Lifespan Realm cultivators attacked together, but their whereabouts and lives are unknown. The Law Transmitter, however, survived." "At that time, the Law Transmitter was only at the Harmonious Dao realm." Li Ping simply explained the cause and effect to Mo Rubin. "Six Lifespan Realm cultivators died here?" Mo Rubin was no longer calm. He retreated slightly, his expression solemn. "I hope it's not what I'm guessing." After a long while, Mo Rubin murmured. "The Law Transmitter used the power of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation to kill those six Lifespan realm cultivators?" Li Ping asked. "If that's the case, it would be the best outcome." Mo Rubin's voice was faint. "I only fear that the True Immortal's remains will revive."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-289" class="calibre1">Chapter 1278: Destroying the World to Survive</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I only fear that the True Immortal's remains might awaken."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Mo Ru Bin spoke these words, Li Ping felt, whether it was his imagination or not, that the depths of the dark sea seemed to grow colder. It was as if some unknown entity had suddenly fixated on him, and a chill coursed through him. The Saint Emperor surveyed his surroundings with great solemnity but found no lurking presence. His gaze returned to the husk of Fang Ding Ge, the sect leader of the Great Dao Sect, and Li Ping asked, "It has already become this way, can it still be revived?" Li Ping was naturally not asking about Fang Ding Ge, but about the True Immortal whose celestial body had transformed into the vast dark sea, and whose consciousness turned into the Immortal Extermination Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin also studied the corpse not far away and said softly, "Let me tell you a story."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Our Nine Refinements Sect once enshrined an ancestor's stone statue, which was said to have been personally crafted by the Nine Refinements Ancestor, the Venerable Wonderful Law, for himself. This statue has been worshipped for thousands of years, and whenever disciples of our sect had doubts on their cultivation path, as long as they prayed to it with sincerity, they would most often receive a response from the netherworld. Thus, the incense has never ceased through the years.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then one day, tribulation clouds suddenly shrouded the sky above the Nine Refinements Sect, and streaks of divine lightning struck down, targeting the ancestor's stone statue! A figure, breaking through the stone statue, soared straight into the heavens! This person's strength was terrifying; the nine heavens divine lightning, capable of instantly destroying cultivators at the Harmonious Dao realm, could not harm him. He laughed unceasingly amidst the lightning, on the verge of withstanding the Heavenly Tribulation and ascending..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping frowned again, "And who was the figure within the stone statue?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene before him suddenly changed, and the towering observation deck seemed to be rapidly descending.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Look at this dark sea, and you can imagine how powerful the 'Immortal' was in life. To put it bluntly, do not try to fathom the methods of an 'Immortal' with our mortal cultivators' eyes. The difference is truly worlds apart!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin let out a cold laugh, "You'll understand when you see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing this rather mystical story, Li Ping couldn't help but frown slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding scenery changed, as if they had left the dark sea and arrived in a completely new, unknown place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin asked, "Guess, between these two who ascended together, who is our Nine Refinements Sect's ancestor?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene of the dark sea below rapidly approached and magnified.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Are we still going to proceed further? Fang Ding Ge's tragic death is not something an ordinary cultivator could accomplish," Li Ping changed the subject.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Venerable Wonderful Law ascended to immortality merely a year ago, and hardly possessed deep foundations. Yet, he could be reborn through the stone statue. Not to mention that True Immortal."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin chuckled, "He was the third-generation sect master of our Nine Refinements Sect. This person defied the ancestor's dying instructions and wanted to establish his own rules. After a period of internal strife, he failed and was heavily injured, disappearing thereafter. Who would have thought he had been hiding within the ancestor's stone statue all along, cultivating all the way to the ascension realm!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">After waiting for a long time and receiving no urging from the Saint Emperor, he could only suppress his breath and continue to speak, "The fragmented pieces of the ancestor's stone statue that had scattered on the ground actually gathered together silently. They approached the person undergoing tribulation. Taking advantage of his unpreparedness, he was swallowed back into the stone statue!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin's voice echoed in his mind. Li Ping felt somewhat at ease and surveyed his surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Mo Ru Bin reached a critical juncture, he paused again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The control center, while located at the deepest part of the dark sea, appeared like a transparent observation deck.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He felt that there were still inaccuracies in Mo Ru Bin's account of the Venerable Wonderful Law's rebirth through the stone statue, and the connection between the third-generation sect master of the Nine Refinements Sect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin smiled slightly, "You are wrong!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the combined efforts of Li Ping and Mo Ru Bin, after considerable effort, they finally reached the control center of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first," Mo Ru Bin asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Nine Refinements Sect's ancestor, the Venerable Wonderful Law, ascended to immortality before countless witnesses, as clearly recorded. However, only the successive sect masters of the Nine Refinements Sect know that the Venerable Wonderful Law died for unknown reasons in his second year after entering the Immortal Realm!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping pondered for a moment and replied, "The figure within the stone statue had to face the tribulation of ascension. It should be him, right? He couldn't ascend in life, so he used the stone statue as a medium, worshipped by his disciples, accumulating millennia of power, aiming to ascend..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now, no matter how that figure struggled, it could no longer escape the confines of the stone statue. And the stone statue, along with that figure, soared through the void!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Passing through three stages of formation, some belonging to the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array, and others set up by later arrivals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's go in and take a look first. If the True Immortal has truly not been reborn, after so many years, he certainly wouldn't still be in the same spot," Mo Ru Bin said, bypassing Fang Ding Ge's remains and continuing to descend into the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin continued with satisfaction, "However, the stone statue he personally crafted holds a backup plan. Even if his soul were annihilated in the Upper Realm, he could still be reborn through this stone statue!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Through this panoramic view, like fully transparent glass formations encircling them, Li Ping and Mo Ru Bin could see the entire dark sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly flooding their vision, reaching directly into the depths of their souls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The good news is that the fallen True Immortal did not get reborn using his remains," Mo Ru Bin's voice was melancholic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Along the way, they did not find the corpses of the other four fallen Longevity realm cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His expression slightly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But after all, this was an ancient secret. It was not the time to delve deeply into such matters while in this dangerous place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yet, it was all in vain, serving as a stepping stone for someone else."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And the bad news?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps because they had communicated with each other for some time, Mo Ru Bin's emotions had stabilized considerably. He spoke with feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of silence, Li Ping finally responded, "Let's hear the good news first."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping walked slowly to where Mo Ru Bin stood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even after being magnified countless times, it was still possible to discern the human-like outline of the dark sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't move."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin had clearly been here before and was not distracted by the magnificent scene. He walked to the center of the observation deck.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He saw the corpses of the other four fallen Longevity realm cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were frozen in their final moments, but unlike Fang Ding Ge, their faces were covered in a gray sheen, and their features were indistinguishable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a vague impression remained of their desperate struggle against the terrifying force that was devouring them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping tried to find the culprit responsible for the demise of these five Longevity realm cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gray vine-like matter, extending from beneath the feet of the four Longevity cultivators and entwining together, attracted Li Ping's attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In Li Ping's observation, these gray vines were purely aggregates of energy, devoid of life force, mere dead things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But for some reason, when he was close to them, Li Ping felt as if he were being targeted by a venomous snake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is this?" Li Ping, without any psychological barriers, asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the 'Will to Survive'. The True Immortal's remains' Will to Survive."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a considerable pause, Mo Ru Bin slowly answered Li Ping's question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"True Immortals cannot be judged by ordinary standards. When Brother Xuanyuan was modifying the True Immortal's remains back then, he had this concern. To prevent its resurrection, he made many arrangements. Who would have thought..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Li Ping could not see Mo Ru Bin's figure, he could sense him staring intently at the gray 'Will to Survive' covering the area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Normally speaking, the True Immortal's remains, already transformed into this dark sea, should not be able to generate such a strong Will to Survive."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Mo Ru Bin's words, Li Ping pondered, "Unless someone deliberately provoked it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Precisely. This person is no simple feat," Mo Ru Bin commented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"First, he was able to circumvent Brother Xuanyuan's imposed restrictions, which is not simple. Second, he could incite the True Immortal's remains' consciousness, which is also not simple. Third, after inciting the Will to Survive, he was able to retreat completely... Remarkable," Mo Ru Bin praised without any trace of admiration in his tone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't underestimate these things. Even if you and I were to be targeted by them inadvertently, we might not be able to escape death. We would only end up like these five empty husks."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping frowned slightly, he still had some confidence in his own strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin did not argue with Li Ping, but continued to explain in a hushed voice, "A person who has already died, yet their Will to Survive is reignited. It's like grasping the last straw of hope, and the power that erupts suddenly..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Instinctively devours everything living it can come into contact with, converting it into sustenance for its own rebirth. Only someone of Brother Xuanyuan's caliber could barely resist. Although we appear strong, we are still far from it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin continued, "Fortunately, the one who incited this back then did not destroy Brother Xuanyuan's arrangements. This 'Will to Survive', after draining these four Longevity cultivators, could no longer find any objects to absorb and thus fell into a silent state again."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If it had escaped the dark sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The entire Xuanhuang Realm would probably have become its meal."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping's expression immediately became extremely solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But, to put it another way, Brother Xuanyuan's methods are not so easily broken. The one who incited this, whom you referred to as the transmitter of the law, did not directly destroy the restrictions of the dark sea. He did not even alter them, but added his own methods."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However... possessing the array control artifact and being fully aware of the restrictions here, making progress with ease." Mo Ru Bin seemed to realize something, and his condensed aura suddenly became unstable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's get to work first." Just as Li Ping was worried that Mo Ru Bin would become hysterical and uncontrollable, Mo Ru Bin instantly calmed down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He transmitted a large amount of information into Li Ping's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is... the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array?" Li Ping recognized the mystery within at a glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Strictly speaking, it's the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array modified by Brother Xuanyuan. The original version of the Ascension Array was created by a great demonic cultivator. Heh heh, this one was a true peerless ferocious demon. He was born from humble beginnings, and his own cultivation talent was insufficient, reaching the Golden Core stage was his limit. Yet, he managed to create this terrifying array. Once the array covered an area, everything within it would be refined into the purest energy."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"He first started with mortal worlds, from weak to strong, exterminating countless beings in countless worlds before finally ascending to the Immortal Realm. After arriving in the Immortal Realm, the first thing he did was to improve the array, still thinking of repeating his actions in the Immortal Realm. Humph, even such a person, during the calamity of the Immortal Realm, died like a fly, instantly. All his life's accumulated treasures went to Brother Xuanyuan. However, Brother Xuanyuan found his inheritance to be very distasteful..." Mo Ru Bin sneered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Such a wrathful and ferocious being could also attain Dao and ascend? Was the Heavenly Tribulation in his world different from that of the Xuanhuang Realm?" Li Ping frowned and asked. In Li Ping's memory, in the Xuanhuang Realm, the Heavenly Tribulation faced by such malevolent cultivators during their tribulation was dozens of times more difficult than usual. It was almost impossible to successfully overcome the tribulation, hence his question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No matter how strong the Heavenly Tribulation is, it has its limits in the lower realms. As long as it is stronger than it, that's enough. Moreover, good and evil are not absolute..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping could clearly feel that as Mo Ru Bin spoke, he was falling into a state of confusion again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What do you need me to do?" Li Ping, at the opportune moment, diverted Mo Ru Bin's attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your formation mastery should not be much weaker than Brother Xuanyuan's. The control center of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array here cannot be moved rashly. If possible, reinforce it with another layer of formations, and push this place further into the depths of the dark sea. Then, sever the connection between the Myriad Immortals Alliance's control artifact and the grand array." Mo Ru Bin said after regaining his composure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping nodded, observing the details of the surrounding formations while comparing them with the ascension array diagrams appearing in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected of Xuan Tianwang, truly the most astonishing genius of the Xuanhuang Realm in ten thousand years."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As fellow formation masters, Li Ping felt a sense of camaraderie upon perceiving the exquisiteness of this array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The essence of Origin Force, prayed for by the Abyssal race, after being absorbed and transformed by the dark sea (the True Immortal's remains), condensed in the depths of the array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It appeared to be an accumulation without order, but Li Ping vaguely sensed that through some means, this power, capable of contending with a True Immortal, could be unleashed instantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To push the Xuanhuang Realm, escaping the control of the True Immortal from the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Using mortal formations to manipulate True Immortal power, remarkable."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping did not find the shadow of the Xuanhuang Realm's original grand array within the formations of the dark sea. This array was likely created solely by Xuan Tianwang. Even the fallen True Immortal attested to Xuan Yuanhong's transcendent formation attainments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Reinforcing the array requires some supplementary materials..." Li Ping mused after observing for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have them here," Mo Ru Bin said immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if prepared long ago, by the time they returned from the hiding place of the 'Will to Survive' to the formation center, he had already taken out a pile of materials.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping quickly counted them &ndash; all were necessary for reinforcing formations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't look at me like that. Your face is also borrowed from me." "As the Dharma King of the Xuan Heaven Sect, it's normal for me to carry resources for a comeback even while fleeing for my life, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Speaking of which, why are you also faceless? Could it be that you have something to do with that True Immortal who saved Brother Xuanyuan back then? I'm timid, don't scare me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping ignored Mo Ru Bin's nonsensical rambling and began to focus on setting up the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Xuan Tianwang's precedent as a reference, Li Ping only needed to follow suit. It was not a difficult task for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the formation gradually took shape, the "observation deck" they were in also seemed to rise higher and higher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin nodded with great satisfaction. After Li Ping finished, he took out another pile of materials.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Deepen it further. Completely suppress the True Immortal's 'Will to Survive' in the depths of the dark sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping agreed with this sentiment. Without complaint, he continued his work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the materials were consumed, the view of the dark sea was only half the size it was initially.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This should be safe enough. Unless someone deliberately disturbs it," Mo Ru Bin stood beside Li Ping, looking down at the dark sea, and said softly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This concerns the safety of Xuanhuang, so it's best to be cautious. I will set up an additional defensive formation here." This was not asking for Mo Ru Bin's opinion but a notification of a decided course of action.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin shrugged, "Suit yourself. So many years have passed, and besides us, no one else has come to this cursed place. Who are you setting up formations to defend against? If that Will to Survive truly breaks free, your formations won't be enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping ignored Mo Ru Bin's sarcasm and very seriously added his strongest sealing formation, achievable with his current capabilities, on top of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alright, next is to sever the Myriad Immortals Alliance's grasping hand," Mo Ru Bin urged after he finished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Currently, the amount of dark energy being extracted is limited. If the dark sea shrinks to a certain extent, perhaps the 'Will to Survive' will sense the vibrant Xuanhuang Realm outside. The scene at that time is truly unimaginable."</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Li Ping was reinforcing the formations here, he had already sensed two intermittent, thin thread-like existences extending from the formation center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their destinations were unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sever the connection between both control artifacts and the center?" Li Ping looked at Mo Ru Bin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The other one, he is probably already dead. So be it," Mo Ru Bin was silent for a moment, then nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping then proceeded to modify the formation center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The process went very smoothly. The Spirit Gathering Ascension Array let out a soft hum, and then seemed to restart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It first dimmed slightly, and then brightened again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping stood in the formation center, sensing the opening in the dark sea that had been cut by the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Clouds rolled, stirring up invisible waves. They swept up the dispersed "clouds" within the dark sea, growing larger and larger. By the time they reached the gaping rift, they had already transformed into a colossal tidal wave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It fiercely struck the Myriad Immortals Alliance's device.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dozens of diligent Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators, who were supervising the extraction of dark energy, were silently swallowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Vanished into thin air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And amidst the violent tremors, the rift also began to close.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite the dramatic upheaval, the Myriad Immortals Alliance did not intend to give up. Within the closing rift, the eye-shaped control artifact reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden abacus rapidly swayed, attempting to salvage the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this time, it had no effect whatsoever. They could only watch as the rift in the dark sea sealed itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dust settled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping and Mo Ru Bin both watched this scene, speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it took some effort, they finally achieved their goal of severing the Myriad Immortals Alliance's extraction of dark energy. Furthermore, they learned many secrets of the ancient Xuan Heaven Sect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping felt a sense of tranquility in his heart. He felt that his connection with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was becoming increasingly close.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he also understood clearly that such an easy manipulation of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array's power was not solely due to his profound formation attainments. It was largely thanks to Mo Ru Bin's help.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without the array diagrams he transmitted, it would not have been possible to decipher Xuan Tianwang's forbidden techniques in a short period.</p>
<p class="calibre2">More critically, Mo Ru Bin's separated and attached demonic face on his own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was precisely because of this face that he could move unimpeded in the deepest part of the dark sea. Even when altering the critical structures of the array, he did not suffer attacks or backlash from the grand array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a sense, Mo Ru Bin's face held a higher authority than the two eye-shaped control artifacts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Back then, among the Twelve Dharma Kings of the Xuan Heaven Sect, what was your rank in terms of strength?" Li Ping suddenly asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then he let out a mocking laugh, "To be honest, among the twelve, my strength was considered the weakest. Although you can barely defeat me, you wouldn't be able to defeat the others."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping naturally did not believe him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin let out a cold snort, "In our era, talented individuals emerged in large numbers. Peerless heavenly prodigies were like schools of fish, countless. It was an undisputed era of cultivation!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the immortal path hadn't suddenly been severed, and a large number of ascenders had appeared densely in a short period, it wouldn't have been impossible."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the records on the Creation Stone Tablet, all information related to those who ascended to immortality had been erased, so he could not verify the truthfulness of Mo Ru Bin's words. However, judging from the various performances of the Twelve Dharma Kings before joining the Xuan Heaven Sect, Mo Ru Bin's words might be exaggerated, but they were consistent with certain facts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If all of you were so strong, how did the Ten Immortal Sects win back then?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even without Xuan Tianwang, with the twelve of you united, the Ten Immortal Sects would still have been difficult to defeat, right?" Li Ping asked the question that had been weighing on his mind for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph." Mo Ru Bin let out a cold snort.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long silence, he finally spoke somewhat vaguely, "In short, we lost, and we lost. I won't deny it. Those people from the Ten Immortal Sects were not just eating dry rice either."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin's tone suddenly turned extremely cold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Someone feigned a fight to the death and suddenly defected. We didn't know who the traitor was, so we couldn't trust anyone. Coupled with Brother Xuanyuan's inexplicable disappearance..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Each of them believed their talent was no less than that of Xuan Yuanhong, merely unfortunate in not ascending at the right time. When the real crisis arrived, they realized that without Brother Xuanyuan leading them, they were just a mob."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Conversely, the Ten Immortal Sects fought desperately, because they knew that if they failed, death awaited them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin suddenly burst into laughter, "But I have let it go now. As they say, the Heavenly Dao is fair. The Ten Immortal Sects were also annihilated by this... Myriad Immortals Alliance, weren't they? Hahahaha! Well deserved!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Well done, Xuanhuang Realm!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin patted Li Ping's shoulder and praised him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Actually, the core figures of the Ten Immortal Sects are probably all still alive." Li Ping suddenly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They are merely living in seclusion and not showing themselves to the world."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin's hand gripping Li Ping's shoulder suddenly tightened with force.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, hmm hmm..." Upon suddenly hearing this news, Mo Ru Bin not only didn't rage but instead began to laugh more and more wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So they are not dead? Even better."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This way, I can personally take revenge. So many years have passed, they should no longer be as united as they were back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin flashed away from Li Ping's side, his figure suddenly darkening considerably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's time to go."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I originally planned to find Brother Xuanyuan, but by chance, I ended up here first. But it's fine, at least one wrong answer has been eliminated."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping felt that the demonic face on his blank face was showing signs of detachment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The darkness surrounding them began to encroach irrepressibly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whispers from the depths of his soul arose, corroding Li Ping's consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Knowing that this was not a place to linger, Li Ping followed Mo Ru Bin and returned from the deepest part of the dark sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Speaking of which, where was your original destination? It required the use of that Immortal Artifact banner?" Li Ping asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Passing by the ethereal corpse of Fang Ding Ge, the sect leader of the Great Dao Sect, he suddenly said to Li Ping, "Go and search him. Perhaps you can pick up some treasures."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping stared at Mo Ru Bin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin rolled his eyes at Li Ping, "This person could withstand the devouring of the Will to Survive and only died after escaping all the way here, which is enough to prove his strength. High-level experts' bodies must contain good things. This is something Brother Xuanyuan taught me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, if he truly had any relics that could survive the erosion of the True Immortal's Will to Survive, they must be extraordinary treasures. Aren't you going to try?" Mo Ru Bin tempted him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping looked again, and finally shook his head slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The deceased deserves peace. There are so many treasures in the world, should we plunder them all? Greed leads to downfall."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Calling you stupid, and you really are stupid," Mo Ru Bin sneered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he did not search Fang Ding Ge's corpse either, and simply let it lie there quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a period of travel, the two returned to where they had come from.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The White Jade flag pole was still planted there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, eroded by the dark energy, the range of its emitted light had shrunk by a full circle compared to before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected of a second-hand item that was reforged, truly worthless," Mo Ru Bin criticized without politeness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With your disruption, I'll have to go find other arrangements left behind from back then. I don't know if they are still there after so many years. If not, I'll come back to trouble you!" Mo Ru Bin said coldly, looking at Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping summoned the Abyssal people and reopened the portal to the outside world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can help you search for Xuan Tianwang."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I need his help," Li Ping said very sincerely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin flew into the passage first, laughing heartily, "Do you really think that after a trip to the dark sea with me, I would completely trust you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Back then, the other eleven brothers and sisters, didn't we all go through life and death together?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Facts tell me that no one can be fully trusted!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Ru Bin's icy voice gradually softened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time Li Ping returned to Nine Mountain Prefecture, Mo Ru Bin's trace was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Saint Emperor did not pursue him further.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This Dharma King of the Xuan Heaven Sect was not his enemy.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-290" class="calibre1">Chapter 1279: Ants Who Harmonize With The Way Die</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of Mo Ru Bin's character or that of the Xuan Heaven Sect cultivators, they were ultimately beings born from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The primary conflict in the Xuanhuang Realm now was the dispute over sovereignty between the indigenous Xuanhuang Realm cultivators and those from other cultivation worlds absorbed due to various reasons since the great calamity of the Immortal Realm. The key to resolving this conflict lay with the two individuals, the Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for Mo Ru Bin, he might even offer assistance at a critical moment. As for Xuan Tianwang..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From the current clues, Xuan Tianwang, Xuan Yuanhong, and Li Ping shared the same objective: to save the Xuanhuang Realm from peril. If Xuan Tianwang was truly not dead, Li Ping would not object to returning the position of Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This journey with Mo Ru Bin was undoubtedly highly rewarding for Li Ping. Besides unexpectedly mastering an Immortal-grade formation, the Gathering of Spirits for Ascension Formation, he had more importantly severed the Myriad Immortals Alliance's clandestine operations for extracting power from the Abyssal Sea. Without the control artifact, the Myriad Immortals Alliance, with its current overt strength, would be absolutely incapable of manipulating the Abyssal Sea again. Although the Myriad Immortals Alliance's purpose for stealing Abyssal power was unclear, this plan was undoubtedly crippled by disrupting it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for deepening his connection with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, it now seemed like a trivial advancement for Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon returning to the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty, Li Ping first went to the treasury. He instructed Cat Treasure to replicate every treasure using the original body of the Skybinding Ring, ensuring three copies of each item were preserved.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although the efficacy of the Ascension Formation will be greatly reduced due to missing materials, it should not be difficult to eventually condense a power equivalent to that of Origin Essence." Thus, Li Fan was privy to their entire operation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This formation shared similarities with the myriad beings' spiritual refinement formation. Modified by Xuan Tianwang, its bloody and malevolent aura was significantly reduced. Li Ping did not reject it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if it's an exaggeration, the strength of the Dharma Kings is indeed terrifying. After all, they have the heritage of the Immortal Realm as their foundation." Li Ping believed that on this matter, the Law Transmitter would reach a consensus with him. After all, after patching things up for thousands of years, the Law Transmitter would certainly not wish to see the Xuanhuang Realm destroyed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not only that, with this great formation, we no longer need to rely too much on the Abyssal race." Let them fight over who the orthodox Xuanhuang lineage is. The problem was whether the Xuanhuang Realm could survive at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it can solve the problem of insufficient Origin Essence." The connection between the Saint Emperor's clone and Li Fan's true body became close again. He would discuss it in the next life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor returned to his throne and sat in contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It can delay the Faceless True Immortal's actions by a full three times!" Whereas the myriad beings' spiritual refinement could merge consciousnesses, condensing energy capable of resisting True Immortals.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Gathering spirits for ascension is powerful, but the efficiency of extracting energy is too low. Completely refining a realm into nothingness only adds a little immortal power. But if it is integrated into the myriad beings' spiritual refinement formation..." In reality, someone had already moved ahead and deduced the envisioned formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Supreme Sect's highest cultivation technique, the Supreme Primordial True Scripture, was forcefully borrowed by him. The Ten Sects' collections must have also fallen into the Law Transmitter's hands. Not to mention the Profound Heaven Mirror, a powerful artifact that even the Ten Sects couldn't find, and which he now controls. The Law Transmitter's strength surpasses that of the Xuan Heaven Sect's Dharma Kings." As for the entangled grievances with Mo Ru Bin, if the two were combined...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Beneath the dark sea, Li Ping constantly faced the threat of annihilation. However, before this, Li Ping focused his attention on the Gathering of Spirits for Ascension Formation. If he were to provoke the Law Transmitter, a battle would inevitably ensue. Li Fan held no ill will towards the Law Transmitter. A question was placed before the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gathering spirits for ascension could extract matter and transform it into transcendent immortal power. Various formation patterns were dissected and merged in his mind. Especially after Mo Ru Bin placed that demonic mask on the Saint Emperor, the images perceived by Li Fan's true body became unprecedentedly clear.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The future battlefield will surely be in the void outside the Xuanhuang Realm," Li Ping thought to himself. Li Fan's mind rapidly deduced: "If I had used this formation before to sacrifice the beings of a small world..." It was purely a difference in their stances. The Saint Emperor's execution speed was beyond question. As soon as the idea arose, he began deducing on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It can be called making the best use of everything! Matter transformed into energy, divine sense merged and sublimated. Wonderful!" The phrase "Mortal world immortal power is harmful and useless," and "Do not become a True Immortal unless absolutely necessary," Li Fan had taken to heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems I still have to personally visit the void outside the realm to familiarize myself with the battlefield environment," Li Ping thought. The Saint Emperor's actions and gains in this trip were immense for Li Fan's true body. Not only did the Immortal-grade formation, the Gathering of Spirits for Ascension Formation, personally set up by Xuan Tianwang, provide a large amount of data supplements for the Dissolution Disc, but also the True Immortal's Will to Survive in the depths of the Abyssal Sea and the dark energy condensed over millennia, which Li Fan coveted. Compared to them, who could only live one life, Li Fan had ample time and sufficient trial-and-error costs in the future to assimilate all these hidden treasures. The prerequisite... was to survive successfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mo Ru Bin, although somewhat repulsive, his words are very reasonable." Confined in the Derivation Law Jade space in this lifetime, he had ample time to digest these gains.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The person who could determine the fate of the Xuanhuang Realm had undergone earth-shattering changes in these past few days. However, the common people within the Xuanhuang Realm remained completely unaware. The same was true within the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The secrecy level of the Abyssal Sea was too high, with only a few Law Transmitters aware of the matter. They were currently gathered, discussing countermeasures.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The most talked-about topic among the Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators now was the interstellar rainbow light messages. More than three months had passed since the rainbow light carrying dozens of Harmonious Dao cultivators from the Myriad Immortals Alliance had left the Xuanhuang Realm. Initially, cultivators worldwide assumed that this group of Harmonious Dao cultivators would disappear without a trace. Unexpectedly, the Myriad Immortals Alliance possessed the means for long-distance communication and periodically released messages from the departing rainbow light!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not achieve this. It was thanks to a beam of sword light communication from the depths of the Star Sea. After analysis, the Immortal Alliance successfully replicated this communication technology and applied it to the departing rainbow light. Because the Immortal Alliance members had the fortune to witness the scenery beyond the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is all this? Why is it so dark?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is the Myriad Immortals Alliance trying to fool us? This looks no different from ordinary spatial rifts."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Where is the Xuan Merchant Immortal Boat from the other side of the Star Sea?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fortunately, I didn't choose to go back then, otherwise, I would be bored to death watching this every day!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Without reaching the Harmonious Dao, one is not qualified to board that interstellar rainbow light. May I ask your current cultivation level?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have only cultivated for a hundred years and have already reached the Golden Core Dao. Reaching Harmonious Dao should be easy!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For the images released by the Myriad Immortals Alliance for unknown reasons, most cultivators adopted a spectator's attitude, offering their judgments. However, some individuals could discern clues from these fleeting glimpses. Outside the Chizha Abyss, in the Broken Palm Immortal City. Shang Shaojun had repeatedly watched these images of the void outside the realm dozens of times. Besides those publicly released by the Myriad Immortals Alliance, he had also obtained some top-secret versions through certain special channels. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead as Shang Shaojun staggered, withdrawing from his contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How do you feel, Young Master?" The one who spoke was Di Yi Jing Lun. He coughed lightly, observing Shang Shaojun with a look of schadenfreude.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The void outside is perilous. I consider my strength considerable, but if I encountered these calamities, I probably wouldn't be able to escape death," Shang Shaojun said, full of lingering fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's alright, I'm the same," Di Yi Jing Lun smiled. "That's why I'm increasingly curious about the White-robed Sword Immortal you mentioned." Di Yi Jing Lun's smile faded. "Not only could he traverse the void unharmed, but he could also send back such crucial information from the other side of the Star Sea... Such a peerless prodigy, I've never heard of him before?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Shang Shaojun also sighed, "It was only after that day that I realized how many extraordinary people there are in the world. I no longer dare to look down upon any hero."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No, no, you misunderstand me," Di Yi Jing Lun shook his head. "I mean, such a figure appearing completely defies logic." Shang Shaojun was stunned. Di Yi Jing Lun suddenly stood up, lightly fanning himself with his feather fan, and slowly said, "Under the current circumstances where cultivation techniques cannot be mutually practiced, not only are cultivation techniques strictly controlled, but even the resources required for advancement are constantly monitored by us."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if rogue cultivators have heaven-defying luck, their cultivation will be limited to the Nascent Soul stage. To advance further, they would inevitably fall into our Myriad Immortals Alliance's sight before this. However, this White-robed Sword Immortal you mentioned..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's as if he sprung from a rock; no matter how we investigate, we find no trace of him." Shang Shaojun, hearing Di Yi Jing Lun's serious tone, was somewhat dismissive. "How many hidden powers are there in the Xuanhuang Realm? Can the Myriad Immortals Alliance know all of them?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Di Yi Jing Lun gently fanned himself again, and a light image appeared before the two of them. It was precisely the scene where Li Fan's Saint Embryo had displayed his divine power outside the Chizha Abyss, breaking through the demonic sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Young Master, what do you think of this swordsmanship?" Di Yi Jing Lun asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Exquisite and natural, as if born from the heavens," Shang Shaojun replied without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This sword is the Sword of Xuanhuang." Di Yi Jing Lun imitated the Saint Embryo Li Fan in the image, then a beam of sword light actually flew out from the tip of his feather fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sword of Xuanhuang..." Shang Shaojun savored the four words. "There are not a few cultivators who practice swordsmanship in the Xuanhuang Realm. Among them, there are also geniuses. So, naturally, one can discern the subtleties of the swordsmanship displayed by this White-robed Sword Immortal."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Saint Embryo Li Fan in the image swung his sword, Di Yi Jing Lun also followed suit with his feather fan. Similar miniature sword lights echoed the image.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Jing Lun, what exactly do you mean?" Shang Shaojun asked, frowning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Does Young Master know about the Heaven Overseeing Hall?" Di Yi Jing Lun evaded the question and retorted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, I know. The Immortal Alliance, through the Heaven Overseeing Hall, constantly monitors the principles of heaven and earth. Besides observing the essence of heaven and earth, most importantly, it can preemptively sense traces of rebellion against these principles," Shang Shaojun replied quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But what does this have to do with the Xuanhuang Sword you mentioned?" "This sword is a wonder of heaven, directly pointing to the principles of heaven and earth," Di Yi Jing Lun said solemnly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, Shang Shaojun seemed to understand something, and a spark flashed in his eyes. "The anomaly in swordsmanship was also observed by the Heaven Overseeing Hall before, but it lasted for a very short time, less than half a month, and then returned to normal. It did not involve the anomaly of a Heavenly Venerate's rebellion, so the Heaven Overseeing Hall merely reported it as usual, filed it, and sealed it. I also saw this record at the time, but I didn't pay much attention to it. It wasn't until you mentioned this White-robed Sword Immortal that I connected them." Di Yi Jing Lun slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Half a month?" Shang Shaojun was somewhat incredulous. At this point, if Shang Shaojun still didn't understand the other party's meaning, he wouldn't be worthy of guarding the Chizha Abyss.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The sword dao had not been completely reversed, indicating that the previous anomaly was a reflection of Harmonious Dao. And the fact that it lasted only half a month from the anomaly to its occurrence indicated that the White-robed Sword Immortal he encountered... was not a strong cultivator who had been Harmonious Dao for a long time. But a lucky individual who had just stepped into that realm. But, was this possible? Realms could be broken through by chance and luck, but the comprehension of swordsmanship, and the ease and fluidity of wielding a sword, required accumulation over time. The image of the Saint Embryo Li Fan traveling with him reappeared in Shang Shaojun's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps... this person is a divinely gifted prodigy?" he said uncertainly. Di Yi Jing Lun replied noncommittally, "Perhaps there is such a possibility. But I am more inclined to believe that an outsider infiltrated our Xuanhuang Realm, used the Sword Dao of Heaven's Wonder to break through to the Harmonious Dao realm, and then lured us to the depths of the Star Sea..." Shang Shaojun interrupted Di Yi Jing Lun's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Jing Lun, is this not a bit too absurd?" Di Yi Jing Lun smiled. "It is merely the most reasonable explanation after eliminating all impossibilities."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This person completely lacks background and appeared abruptly." "After reaching Harmonious Dao, he could completely integrate and comprehend... especially the Sword Dao, one of the most complex among the principles of heaven and earth. If this person truly achieved all this through his own efforts without any foundation, I would call him the most talented person in history, second only to the Law Transmitter." "Moreover, based on your description of him, he easily subdued the morale of the Broken Palm Immortal City with just a few words..." Di Yi Jing Lun let out another cold laugh. Shang Shaojun thought of more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There were disloyal individuals within the Immortal Alliance. Someone wanting to correct the wrongs. This was the repeated plea. After being guided, he had indeed developed such suspicions and even planned to unite his friends to investigate the truth. But what if that person's intentions were malicious from the start? If he caused internal strife within the Immortal Alliance because of this, and was taken advantage of by others, wouldn't he become a traitor to the Xuanhuang Realm? Thinking of this, Shang Shaojun couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this time, Di Yi Jing Lun also said, "When you first found me, I was indeed somewhat persuaded. But after some investigation, I found something amiss." "Young Master, you are an important minister of the Immortal Alliance. Every word and deed must be cautious." Shang Shaojun nodded slightly and fell into thought. "Before the truth is understood, do not act rashly. If that person contacts you again, report it immediately. I will handle it." After giving instructions, Di Yi Jing Lun gracefully left the Chizha Abyss shrouded in white mist. It was only after a long time that Shang Shaojun reacted. Originally, he wanted to incite Di Yi Jing Lun to rebel, but unexpectedly, he was so easily swayed by the other party. He was indeed worthy of the name "First."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Who exactly are you?" Shang Shaojun gazed at the starry sky, and the figure of the white-robed Sword Immortal, like a celestial being, reappeared before his eyes. Setting aside the Xuan Merchant Immortal Boat beyond the Star Sea for now. Let's talk about the departing rainbow light, en route to the Xuan Merchant Immortal Boat. After transmitting the recorded influences of the rainbow light to the Myriad Immortals Alliance, Lan Yu intently scrutinized the path ahead. The surroundings were pitch black, appearing serene. In fact, to his senses, it was fraught with peril, filled with killing intent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Lan Yu, we've been out for so long, have we gained anything?" Jin Ri's voice came from behind. Lan Yu had always had a poor impression of this Harmonious Dao cultivator who enjoyed joining in the fun. At this moment, he merely responded indifferently, "It can be considered a small gain." Jin Ri sneered and transmitted his voice, "Brother Lan Yu, you mentioned that here in the Star Sea, we are no longer bound by the power of Heavenly Venerates. Doesn't that make it easier to break through?" "I heard your cultivation technique is the direct lineage of the Great Law Master from the past, possibly from the Immortal Realm. And I saw that you seem to have become younger in a short period..." "Jin Ri, you've crossed the line," Lan Yu said sternly, interrupting Jin Ri. Jin Ri was not embarrassed either. He cupped his hands and smiled as he left.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu turned around and continued to monitor the darkness in the direction the rainbow light was advancing. He sighed inwardly. The atmosphere on this flying boat, internally named "Revering the Venerable," was somewhat subtle. The protective rainbow light had been largely depleted when escaping the Immortal Ruins, yet the flying boat continued to speed towards the Star Sea without slowing down. However, in just a few months, three Harmonious Dao cultivators had already died bizarrely. If they died from strange disasters outside the Star Sea, it would be one thing, but crucially, these three Harmonious Dao cultivators had all died inexplicably. Everyone had personally investigated, and no one could figure out the truth behind their sudden deaths. The three corpses still lay in the flying boat, their faces ruddy, as if they were merely asleep. But internally, their entire souls had been hollowed out without them realizing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is Harmonious Dao," Lan Yu's heart was heavy. Among the three who perished, one named Qing Yan was an old Harmonious Dao cultivator like himself, and his strength was not much inferior to his. Yet, he died so inexplicably. Lan Yu even missed the fallen anomalies in the Xuanhuang Realm. At least, even if they fell, they could understand the cause of death. "However, I heard that before we departed, those anomalies also showed signs of abnormality? What an eventful period." Lan Yu, who had survived since the great calamity, instinctively felt a sense of unusualness. Just as his thoughts were drifting, a shrill scream suddenly awakened him. Lan Yu's expression changed. Realizing something was wrong, he rushed towards the source of the sound. By the time he arrived, four Harmonious Dao cultivators had already gathered around. The focus of their horrified gazes was on another corpse lying on the ground. Lan Yu's pupils constricted, because this time, the deceased was none other than Immortal Venerable Jin Ri, who had been trying to ingratiate himself with him earlier! Looking at Jin Ri's ruddy face and lifeless body, Lan Yu couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, the survivors on the flying boat had all assembled. "Old Guan, you should go first." Guan Xing Xiu walked out slowly from the crowd, his expression solemn. After carefully examining Immortal Venerable Jin Ri's corpse, he concluded, "The same method of death." A commotion erupted among the crowd. "Who the hell is it?" "It's too stifling, too stifling! We are all Harmonious Dao cultivators who once shook one side, yet we are being slaughtered and butchered so inexplicably on this small boat!" "We... should we go back? It's not that Old Xu is afraid of death, but if we see the legendary Xuan Immortal Boat and attain enlightenment, then death would be acceptable. What is this now? If we return, won't we lose all face?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">... "Quiet!" Guan Xing Xiu impatiently interrupted the crowd's discussion. "From now on, act together. Do not separate." "It's not a calamity from the void, but someone has attained enlightenment and is committing murder." Guan Xing Xiu's words stirred up a thousand waves. "What did you say?" "Old Guan, are you crazy? Although you are the head of the Garrison Hall and specifically responsible for this area, this is too absurd?" Guan Xing Xiu waved his hand, suppressing the voices of the crowd. "I have my reasons for saying this." Behind Guan Xing Xiu, a small golden sword rose into the air. After circling once, it instantly aimed at the corpse of Jin Ri lying on the ground. A faint black thread was cut off from the corpse by the golden sword. Guan Xing Xiu held the thread, and it seemed to have its own life, struggling frantically.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu observed for a moment and said incredvtimidly, "Xing Xiu, are you saying that the murderer easily killed those people with this thread?" Guan Xing Xiu, who had respect for Lan Yu, nodded. "From the looks of it, yes." "If any of you don't believe it, you can try the power of this black thread yourself." "I will!" Sun Lu Chang volunteered. Soon, the experiment ended with him having several holes poked in his body. This was even after the black thread was suppressed by the Golden Falling Star Divine Sword. "How is this possible? Just a thread, how can it be so strong?" Sun Lu Chang said, somewhat dejected. The other Harmonious Dao cultivators also looked incredulous.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu swept his gaze across the crowd and said loudly, "Everyone, I know you all hold important positions and are highly respected in the Immortal Alliance. But don't forget, we are now in the Star Sea!" "I believe everyone can feel that the laws of the Star Sea are far superior to the Xuanhuang Realm. Moreover, without the constraints of Heavenly Venerates, the long-suppressed breakthroughs have finally come, and it is not impossible for realms to advance by leaps and bounds!" Sun Lu Chang said unconvincingly, "But even so, how can the gap be so large? It's one thing to be inferior, but not even being able to struggle or make a sound... If he truly had such power, why wouldn't he just kill us all?" Sun Lu Chang's words were echoed by the crowd.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu said at this moment, "Perhaps, it's because this person's cultivation technique is very special. It's not outright power suppression, but the battle takes place within the soul and consciousness, without causing any energy fluctuations." "As for this black thread, it is the medium for launching the attack." Lan Yu was the most senior among them, and his words gradually gained their trust. "Since that's the case, let's follow the thread and find that bastard!" Under the crowd's suggestion, Guan Xing Xiu came into contact with the black thread of each surviving Harmonious Dao cultivator. He found no connection to anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The murderer is cautious and cunning, and would certainly not leave such an obvious clue. In my opinion, this was intentionally left behind to mislead us," said a Harmonious Dao cultivator named Zi Mu. "It may not be so. He certainly didn't expect Brother Guan's cultivation to advance so rapidly and be able to discover his trace," argued another cultivator. "Brother Guan, how exactly did you attain enlightenment? In this vast dark Star Sea, I feel nothing." "Yes, Old Guan, tell us. Now that a hidden murderer is watching us menacingly, only by each of us attaining enlightenment and increasing our strength can we avoid being defeated one by one." The crowd chattered endlessly. Guan Xing Xiu helplessly recounted his sudden enlightenment.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-291" class="calibre1">Chapter 1280: Blue Feather Heavenly Capital Secret</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu spoke eloquently on the flying boat. Initially, his words were somewhat hesitant, but as he continued, his conviction grew, as if the principles he spoke of were inherent truths of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The laws of the Star Sea can be considered a higher-level replacement for the laws of Xuanhuang. Therefore, the key to our breakthrough is to find the 'Star Sea Path' corresponding to our cultivated Dao within this silent Star Sea. All of you who have achieved the Harmonious Dao undoubtedly possess strong innate qualities. As long as you cast aside your fear of the Star Sea and instead approach it with a bình thường mindset, just as you did in the Xuanhuang Realm, focusing your hearts and sensing, I believe this will not be too difficult."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu then detailed how he sensed his own Star Sea Path. As he spoke with enthusiasm, a voice filled with extreme panic suddenly interrupted him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Zi Mu, one of the survivors. "Old Guan, if... I mean, if the Dao that I cultivate no longer exists in the Star Sea, what should we do?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zi Mu stared intently at Guan Xing Xiu. "Does this mean our path forward is severed, and we can no longer progress further?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other Harmonious Dao cultivators present also displayed varied expressions upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some turned pale, while others felt a sense of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was because they too had discovered that perhaps due to the cataclysms that had destroyed the Immortal Realm, the laws of the Star Sea were shattered and incomplete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He knew of Tiandu, the Grand Magus's palace. But what was this Origin Dao Palace?</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You don't even know of the Origin Dao Palace? What kind of bumpkin are you! The source of myriad laws, the head of all Daos. Even the direct disciples of the Ten Immortal Sects would have to queue up obediently here!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">In those prosperous times of the Immortal Dao, the Ten Great Sects stood tall. He was merely one of the countless ordinary cultivators under their rule. His innate talent was mediocre, and he had no great fortuitous encounters. Originally, the Golden Core realm should have been his limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After some inquiries, he learned that this so-called "Master Appreciation Ceremony" was a grand event held every hundred years by the Ten Immortal Sects to express their gratitude for the benevolent teachings of the Grand Magus Tiandu. Important figures from the Ten Great Sects would all attend.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu himself did not refute this point either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reverent and awestruck gazes of others made Wu Fu Qiu even more curious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu was momentarily stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Heading towards the legendary Tiandu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, the Dao had vanished from the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After repeated deliberation, he ultimately could not shake off the demonic thoughts that lingered in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I am fortunate enough to gain his favor..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu's expression was solemn, but he casually brushed off the crowd. Yet, in his heart, he was truly puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crowd reacted differently for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh! I seem to recall."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So it seems, among us, who has the highest potential for achievement, it would likely be Brother Lan Yu." A Harmonious Dao cultivator named Qing Shuang suddenly said inexplicably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was none other than because among all the Harmonious Dao cultivators present, or even in the entire Xuanhuang Realm, he was the most unique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A full half a day later, the grand fleet of the Ten Great Sects finally passed, and the aerial passage reopened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't that their innate qualities were insufficient to sense their corresponding Star Sea Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, what's happening ahead with such a large commotion?" Wu Fu Qiu looked at the blocked aerial passage and the flying boats, each resembling a city in size, flying overhead, and curiously asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Congratulations in advance, Fellow Daoist Lan!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I, Wu Fu Qiu, seem to have truly poor aptitude."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, at the foot of the mountain, countless young cultivators, just like him, filled with a sliver of hope after enduring hardships, had come seeking fortuitous encounters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because he had not sensed the Star Sea Dao in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu's heart trembled. At the same time, an unprecedented ambition suddenly arose in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I say, Brother Lan Yu, you've been slow to break through. Is it possible you've been overwhelmed by too many choices?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the only Harmonious Dao cultivator of the ancient methods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he was refuted without mercy: "If it were below the Harmonious Dao realm, or cultivators from other worlds, perhaps. But we Harmonious Dao cultivators of Xuanhuang have already devoured the essence of heaven and earth, our bodies merging with the laws. Humph, how can changing to another Dao path be easy?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu became somewhat confused at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Wu Fu Qiu watched the direction the Ten Great Sects departed and was unwilling to leave for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Think carefully! Who is the Grand Magus? How can mortals like you easily meet him? If you wish to see the Grand Magus's visage, you must first enter the Origin Dao Palace and pray devoutly. If you can catch the Grand Magus's eye, he will naturally guide you to Tiandu."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What, you want to go in too? No problem, just pay one thousand high-grade spirit stones, and you can queue up there!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu, dejected, was squeezed out by the subsequent crowd.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One thousand high-grade spirit stones were enough to buy a decent Nascent Soul cultivation technique. If he had that many spirit stones, why would he travel thousands of miles to seek an opportunity?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although his purse was meager, Wu Fu Qiu was not going to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because he discovered that there were many others who, like him, could not afford the money and were unable to go up the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After spending half a month getting acquainted with them, Wu Fu Qiu obtained an important piece of information.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The so-called Origin Dao Palace was merely built by the Ten Great Sects later on. It had no actual connection to the true Tiandu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The true Origin Dao land referred to the entire area below Tiandu. It was just that the Ten Great Sects had cordoned off a large portion to build the Origin Dao Palace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But they hadn't been completely ruthless, leaving this area at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Grand Magus hasn't appeared for who knows how many years. Saying it's easier to catch the Grand Magus's eye on the mountain is just to comfort oneself."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes, the Grand Magus hangs high above, in his eyes, what difference is there between the mountain and the foot of the mountain?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the words of those huddled on the ground, Wu Fu Qiu also settled down at the foot of the Origin Dao Palace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He stayed there for a full twenty years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some came anew, some left. Some died with regret, others, filled with resentment, cursed the Grand Magus to death and were summarily executed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu also transformed from a young lad into a middle-aged man.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He didn't know what it was that allowed him to persist in guarding here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps for a mediocre talent like him, it didn't matter where he went.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During these years, while guarding, he had not neglected his cultivation. However, without a source of spirit stones, he could only live off his savings. Although the Origin Dao land had dense spiritual energy, it couldn't sustain so many people absorbing it simultaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only was there no progress, but there were even signs of regression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Things had reached this point, and Wu Fu Qiu accepted his fate, no longer harboring any unrealistic fantasies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since he was an orphan from childhood, drifting and without support, after staying at the foot of the Origin Dao Palace for over twenty years, he had become accustomed to the scenery. He had subconsciously regarded this place as his homeland.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every time young people arrived with hope, begging for the Grand Magus's blessings, he would just smile without comment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if seeing himself in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he didn't shatter the illusions of these young people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because anyone who did so was cleared out by the people of the Ten Great Sects.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the wonders of the world lie precisely in this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just when Wu Fu Qiu had completely put the Grand Magus's blessings out of his mind...</p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, the sky suddenly bloomed with ten thousand feet of colorful auspicious light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thousands of cultivators below the Origin Dao Palace were stunned on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not knowing who first shouted, "The Grand Magus has manifested!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, in a state of extreme excitement and trepidation, the crowd on the ground knelt down in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only Wu Fu Qiu, his mind a blank, stood frozen on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Bold! How dare you disrespect the Grand Magus!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sword light, accompanied by an angry shout, flew from afar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Wu Fu Qiu was about to be beheaded, a blue feather slowly floated down from the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The white sword light, arriving first. Flying at extreme speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The blue feather, falling later. Drifting slowly, abnormally slow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, a bizarre scene occurred. Under the eyes of all, this blue feather actually landed on Wu Fu Qiu's body before the white sword light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sword light arrived late but did not behead Wu Fu Qiu. It merely passed through him, killing three kneeling cultivators behind him on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Wu Fu Qiu himself...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the light of Lan Yu, he uncontrollably began to rise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the gasps of the crowd, he ascended higher and higher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Surpassing the summit of the Origin Dao Palace, flying through the clouds, and in an instant, arriving before a purplish-gold dojo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu felt as if he were in a dream, standing there for a long time before regaining his senses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was different from the sacred Tiandu he had imagined. The place was empty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Quiet and deathly still.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a faint chanting sound came from within.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu cautiously followed the direction of the sound to the deepest part of the dojo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The purplish-gold wooden building, with its ancient design, exuded a faint fragrance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu knelt and paid his respects. After a long time without a response, he boldly pushed open the door and entered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene inside the wooden building unfolded before his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A blurry figure sat cross-legged, muttering incantations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Behind him stood a young boy in a blue and white robe, eyes closed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The boy had rosy lips and white teeth, with a delicate face, making it impossible to tell if he was male or female.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Lan Yu noticed that this boy seemed to have just fought a battle, as his robe was slightly tattered and had faint traces of blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu dared not act presumptuously and bowed his head again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But neither the figure nor the boy showed any reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This figure must be the Grand Magus Tiandu."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, Wu Fu Qiu dared to get up, and mimicking the phantom, he also sat cross-legged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Carefully listening to the incessant chanting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gradually, he seemed to understand something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The blue feather, which had appeared and then vanished on him earlier, suddenly reappeared in his dantian.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Feather Transformation Technique..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The heavens and earth have infinite epochs, countless worlds are born and perish, like feathers falling in the void."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Transforming the body into a feather, synchronizing with the world, one can follow the flow of epochs, remain alive through calamities, and achieve eternal transcendence..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu listened entranced, sometimes frowning, sometimes rejoicing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This "Myriad Tribulations Feather Transformation Technique" was too profound for a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But even glimpsing a corner of it gave him a profound realization, and his cultivation realm within his body surged continuously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu became immersed in it, losing track of time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, he felt the light and shadow shift before his eyes, startling him awake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He saw the boy who had been sitting with his eyes closed waving at him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although no words were spoken, Wu Fu Qiu understood that he was being asked to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with countless regrets, Wu Fu Qiu had no choice but to silently withdraw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before leaving the purplish-gold wooden building, he politely closed the door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the door closed, a stream of light flew out from within.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wu Fu Qiu instinctively caught it and found it to be a miniature building shaped like a ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Magic artifact, a training ground."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It also has storage functions."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief inspection, Wu Fu Qiu's face lit up with joy. He bowed three more times towards the inside and then left Tiandu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only then did he realize that after he left the purplish-gold wooden building, he could no longer hear the voice of the sitting phantom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sense of loss welled up in his heart, and Wu Fu Qiu even suddenly felt an urge to return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But after all, he was the Grand Magus of the Ten Immortal Sects; he ultimately dared not act presumptuously and left the Heavenly Capital.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When he returned to the mortal world, he was shocked to find that the Origin Dao Palace at the foot of the mountain had inexplicably disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the surrounding terrain had changed dramatically, as if a great battle had erupted here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After searching for a long time, Wu Fu Qiu finally found a living cultivator in the vicinity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the cultivator's respectful and subservient attitude, Wu Fu Qiu was horrified to realize that he had unknowingly become a top-tier cultivator in the Xuanhuang Realm, a Harmonious Dao realm cultivator!</p>
<p class="calibre2">And several centuries had passed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The rule of the Ten Immortal Sects was no longer as absolute, and an organization called the Myriad Immortals Alliance had risen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist Lan Yu?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu's voice pulled Lan Yu from his memories.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes, I was originally a mediocre person who only achieved Harmonious Dao through sheer luck."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So many years have passed, and the flattery from my disciples and subordinates has almost made me forget this fact."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu felt a sense of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my innate talent were truly so poor, I wouldn't have only cultivated the dignified 'Myriad Tribulations Feather Transformation Technique' to the Harmonious Dao realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Without the Grand Magus's teachings, after thousands of years, I still haven't made any further progress."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu shook his head secretly, his thoughts returning to reality, and looked at Guan Xing Xiu. "I believe your judgment. Since the culprit is hidden among us, as long as we gather together and wait for him to reveal a flaw, it will be enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu paused, then added, "This person just broke through and eagerly committed murder. If it's not for psychological reasons, it must be because his cultivation technique requires him to blood sacrifice other cultivators after breaking through. He definitely won't stop next."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone present nodded in agreement with his judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For self-preservation, these Harmonious Dao cultivators from the Myriad Immortals Alliance remained in the main hall of the "Revering the Venerable" flying boat, watching each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the killer's cunning completely surpassed their imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nine days later, as the flying boat successfully navigated through a surviving calamity in the void, another corpse was found on board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu and Guan Xing Xiu exchanged glances, confirming the demise of "Zi Mu."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The pressure in their hearts immediately increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Old Guan? We were all together just now, right? You have the highest cultivation among us, did you perceive who the devil did it?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing the expectant gazes of everyone, Guan Xing Xiu could only shake his head helplessly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hall erupted in an uproar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, calm down. We were all focused on dealing with the void calamity just now, so we were inadvertently careless and were ambushed by the killer."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What do we do now? To not evade this calamity is death, but to evade it means being assassinated..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, in my opinion, we don't need to bother hiding from this calamity anymore. At worst, we can all die together!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Xu, don't speak in anger. We still have so many people!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No, I want to leave this boat!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">As everyone was discussing, a sharp scream suddenly suppressed all other noises.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu and the others looked over and saw that Qing Shuang, the Harmonious Dao cultivator who had been relatively calm before, suddenly seemed to have a psychological breakdown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His expression became demonic, his eyes gleamed with madness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Muttering to himself, he was about to rush out of the main hall and leave the flying boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Stop him!" Guan Xing Xiu roared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only Lan Yu and a few others made a move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being inside the flying boat, fearing damage to it, everyone was restrained in their actions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For a while, they were unable to do anything to the crazed Qing Shuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the stalemate was about to be broken, Qing Shuang's actions suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His expression froze, and he stood there blankly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before the others could react, Guan Xing Xiu's expression changed, and he immediately flew forward to check.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"He's dead."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A moment later, he turned back with an extremely grim expression and said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A chill instantly enveloped everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the initial murders, the killer's methods seemed to be becoming more skilled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While dealing with the void calamity could be an excuse, this time it was undeniably happening while everyone was focused and watching.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And yet the killer still acted with impunity...</p>
<p class="calibre2">How could they defend against this?</p>
<p class="calibre2">A deathly silence fell within the flying boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I actually think what Qing Shuang said before was not without reason," Sun Lu Chang said, breaking the silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"From the current situation, this killer's strength is growing too rapidly. Perhaps in a while, after killing a few more, he won't need to act stealthily anymore. He'll just appear directly and kill us one by one. Staying on the boat is definitely a dead end. It's better to abandon the ship and seek survival in the void separately."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's right. The 'Revering the Venerable' flying boat travels extremely fast. As long as we leave separately at intervals, our relative distances in the Star Sea will be very far apart. The Star Sea is vast; even if he has heaven-defying abilities, he absolutely cannot capture us all!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, this area is still within the suction range of the Immortal Ruins. As long as we follow the direction of the suction, we can return to the Xuanhuang Realm. Coupled with the "Empty Light Flowing Crystal" artifacts distributed by the Immortal Alliance, returning safely is not an issue."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">With each person speaking their piece, they slowly reached a consensus.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, more than half of them chose to give up and disembark midway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu looked at Lan Yu, seeking the opinion of this most senior Harmonious Dao cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu sighed softly, "Heaven and earth are vast, and life is paramount. Their choice is understandable."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To avoid further casualties, let it be decided this way."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Elder Lan, aren't you leaving?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu shook his head. "My lifespan is nearing its end. Returning would only be waiting for death. It's better to seek a sliver of hope in the void."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone present was greatly shocked upon hearing this. They expressed their blessings and then successively left the flying boat, returning to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dying ignominiously during the exploration of the Star Sea was perhaps undignified.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was still better than losing one's life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all the commotion, only five people remained on the flying boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu, Guan Xing Xiu, Sun Lu Chang, Xu Guan Hai, and Zi Mei.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu looked at Xu Guan Hai with some surprise. "You didn't leave?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Guan Hai chuckled, "I actually feel that with a large group leaving, it might be safer on the boat now."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Besides, no matter what, I still want to see that legendary Xuan Merchant Immortal Boat with my own eyes."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Guan Hai looked at Sun Lu Chang. "Brother Sun, you're the odd one out. You were the loudest person demanding to leave when everyone was arguing. Why did you stay?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Lu Chang looked somewhat embarrassed. "My cultivation is too weak. If I leave the flying boat, I doubt I can return to the Xuanhuang Realm with my own strength. Staying here is actually safer."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone present was rendered speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They could see that what Sun Lu Chang said was indeed true.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike their voluntary decision to stay, Sun Lu Chang was forcibly assigned to the flying boat by the Immortal Alliance. His strength was the weakest among everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Lu Chang moved closer to Guan Xing Xiu and Lan Yu. "Lords, do you think the killer is among us?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other four looked at each other, their expressions somewhat subtle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until the killer's identity is revealed, no one can be absolutely sure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since everyone has decided to stay, then our original route remains unchanged," Guan Xing Xiu said loudly after a period of silence. "We can shrink the space of the 'Revering the Venerable' flying boat to accelerate the travel time."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh, by the way, Xing Xiu. Why is this flying boat called 'Revering the Venerable'? I always feel like the name is somewhat ominous," Lan Yu asked, frowning, as if remembering something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu paused slightly, then replied, "I don't know. It was a decree from the Law Transmitters themselves. I can only guess it means 'paying homage to the Heavenly Venerate'."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, Lan Yu's frown deepened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked up at the flying boat and posed a question that sent chills down the spines of the other four. "Are there any others on the 'Revering the Venerable' flying boat besides us?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Shouldn't be... no," Guan Xing Xiu replied somewhat hesitantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Zi Mei, who had been silent all along, suddenly spoke. "Perhaps? This flying boat... is alive?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Lu Chang was startled and quickly asked, "Fellow Daoist Zi, what makes you say that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zi Mei spoke softly, "I sensed the Dao of the Star Sea, and I observed the Harmonious Dao cultivators on the flying boat perishing like ants. Thus, I had a breakthrough."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In my perception, this flying boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's like it has its own life."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zi Mei's words sent shivers down everyone's spines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu said hesitantly, "If that's true, then the Immortal Alliance must have surely..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point, Guan Xing Xiu abruptly stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Golden Falling Star Divine Sword above his head erupted with golden light. Guan Xing Xiu gathered all the black threads he had extracted from the assassinated Harmonious Dao cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like living worms, the threads merged together, becoming thicker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had already allowed everyone present to come into contact with this murder weapon before, and no one had sensed any connection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he had overlooked the boat itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The last five people on the flying boat exchanged glances and instantly reached a consensus.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The five Harmonious Dao cultivators worked together to trap the black thread in the center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Old Guan, go to the flying boat's control center," Xu Guan Hai said in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This sentence seemed to enrage the black thread, which violently slammed against the seal trapping it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The five Harmonious Dao cultivators worked in unison, locking it firmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They moved to the center of the "Revering the Venerable" flying boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu took a deep breath and opened the flying boat's main control formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the center of the formation, the phantom image of the "Revering the Venerable" flying boat floated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if guided by an unseen force, the black thread, confined by the crowd, floated uncontrollably towards the phantom image within the main control formation!</p>
<p class="calibre2">All five of them turned pale simultaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">*Boom!*</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the flying boat suddenly trembled violently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The thick black thread suddenly unleashed an impact force several times greater than before, instantly breaking free from everyone's restraint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It returned to the phantom image of the flying boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the truth was revealed!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The perpetrator of the murders of several Harmonious Dao cultivators was none other than the flying boat they were traveling on!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This conclusion was simply unimaginable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the facts were now before them, Guan Xing Xiu still found it difficult to believe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why..." he gritted out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the commander appointed by the Immortal Alliance, nominally in control of the "Revering the Venerable" flying boat,</p>
<p class="calibre2">This creation, originally under his control, had, right under his nose, slaughtered his colleagues!</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was simply a blatant humiliation!</p>
<p class="calibre2">*Clang!*</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Falling Star Divine Sword was unsheathed, pointing directly at the phantom image of the flying boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the next moment, Guan Xing Xiu was about to cleave the flying boat in two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just then, a cold voice suddenly echoed in the space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Final mission objective: Meet the Heavenly Venerate."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Probability of mission success, low."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Searching for solutions..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Based on calculations, transforming each Harmonious Dao cultivator on the flying boat into the flying boat's energy will increase the mission success rate by one..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flickering voice of the flying boat sent everyone into a state of icy dread.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the dozens of corpses that subsequently appeared in the projected image sent them into utter fury!</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were precisely the Harmonious Dao cultivators who had "disembarked" earlier!</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-292" class="calibre1">Chapter 1281: Reunion in the Sea of Stars</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless Harmonious Dao corpses, like kites with strings, drifted haphazardly. The expressions on their faces still held the joy of escaping calamity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Damn it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping watched as these once-vivid faces turned utterly frozen. Guan Xing Xiu could no longer restrain himself. The Falling Star Divine Sword transformed into a golden streak of light and slashed straight ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A cyan figure suddenly appeared, blocking the sword light.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ice crystals bloomed like flowers at his fingertips, the surrounding air seemed to freeze, and the Falling Star Divine Sword was suspended in mid-air.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is... Qing Shuang?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Guan Hai looked at the familiar yet strange figure and exclaimed in disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The one casting the spell to block the Falling Star Divine Sword was none other than Qing Shuang, who had been drained of his essence and supposedly perished not long ago. However...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The five surviving Harmonious Dao cultivators suddenly tensed their nerves again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This place is not suitable for lingering. How about we rest for a while and then break out together?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu narrowed his eyes, unable to conceal his shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu's eyes flashed with a hint of determination. "Then let's destroy this monster first!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Guan Hai gave a wry smile. "Old Guan, it seems we are beyond saving this time. One or two Heavenly Souls, perhaps I wouldn't fear them. But so many... and this terrifying flying boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Familiar faces seemed to drift from the shadows.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's still inside the flying boat! We're imprisoned!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If we don't resist, we'll surely die. Let's go all out!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu strode forward, blocking the path of the Heavenly Souls, and said solemnly, "Inquire about the current mission completion probability."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But just like the real Star Sea void, this place seemed boundless. The light of the Falling Star was like a firefly, extinguished in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What made them even more terrified was that a thin thread extended from behind the new Heavenly Soul, Qing Shuang, and stretched into the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All the floating Heavenly Souls fell into a stupor. After a moment, the cold voice of the Revered Venerable Flying Boat echoed: "Current mission feasibility, extremely high."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Surrounding the five survivors.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Lu Chang's face turned pale, his body trembling. "How is this possible? Killing them is one thing, but to extract and refine Heavenly Souls like this? What kind of heretical art is this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Old Guan, be careful, this Qing Shuang is not Ji Wan Tao himself, but a Heavenly Soul!" Xu Guan Hai also saw the truth and shouted a warning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only Xu Guan Hai showed a wry smile. "I didn't expect to live a little longer, consider it a gain. Everyone, relax. This fellow has swallowed so many Harmonious Dao cultivators at once, perhaps he can last until we see the Heavenly Venerate himself?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Zi Mei remained pensive. "This place is far from the Xuanhuang Realm, and the laws of returning to heaven naturally no longer apply. If some special means are employed, it might be possible to disguise oneself as the Heavenly Dao and receive these Heavenly Souls."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As they communicated with each other, time slowly passed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"He's... out?" Sun Lu Chang was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When they had all recovered to their optimal state and acted, their movements were smoother than they had imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This seemingly desperate crisis had suddenly vanished into nothingness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Energy replenishment plan aborted."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wrong!" Guan Xing Xiu's expression was stern as he looked at the surrounding void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Lu Chang touched the cold sweat on his forehead and let out a long sigh of relief. He still found it hard to believe. "It's... it's resolved just like that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait!" Just as the Falling Star Divine Sword was about to pierce the deck of the flying boat, Lan Yu suddenly shouted to stop him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Go!" Guan Xing Xiu was still unwilling to give up. He summoned the Falling Star Divine Sword and flew rapidly towards the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After careful observation, they discovered that the appearance of this Heavenly Soul, Qing Shuang, was no longer the blurry face from before. It was very similar to the appearance of Immortal Venerable Ji Wan Tao in his lifetime.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu's expression did not ease at all. "It's only temporary. It seems that with sufficient energy, as long as we don't escape, it won't attack us."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zi Mei remained silent, her expression also solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The thin threads were the same as the deadly weapons they had discovered earlier, used by the flying boat to slaughter Harmonious Dao cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Falling Star Divine Sword instantly erupted with incomparably dazzling light, attempting to illuminate this dark space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Besides, they were ambushed before. The five of us working together, perhaps we can successfully escape this hellish place," Xu Guan Hai transmitted telepathically.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Current energy reserves: abundant."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Voices echoed continuously. The drifting, expressionless Heavenly Souls were once again dragged back into the void by those thin threads.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only did no Heavenly Souls come out to obstruct them, but the Revered Venerable Flying Boat itself was like paper, easily torn to shreds.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As they confronted the flying boat, large numbers of thin threads extended from the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have the Tiandu Martial Arts Arena. If I unfold the Martial Arts Barrier, it should be able to delay for a considerable amount of time," Lan Yu said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu nodded and said coldly, "However, once its energy is insufficient, it will inevitably hunt and absorb us again. Hmph, to think that we, the important ministers of the Immortal Alliance, would now be reduced to food for a mere artifact in this cold void. How ironic..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the five Harmonious Dao cultivators were not only filled with despair but also a renewed sense of determination.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Old Guan, it seems we are trapped," Xu Guan Hai said with a bitter smile. "One or two Heavenly Souls, I might not fear them. But so many... and this terrifying flying boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The five of them were trapped in the void cage, but after a period of careful observation, they discovered that the barrier was not impenetrable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This place is a formation of absolute confinement; I cannot find the exit. However, if the Revered Venerable Flying Boat intends to kill us again, it will inevitably open a gap. That will be our chance."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a while, Lan Yu suddenly said this, igniting hope in everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I will unfold my Martial Arts Arena, everyone enter and take shelter to prevent the flying boat from ambushing us again."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he spoke, a circular building appeared in the dark void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With no better option, everyone flew into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the gap closed, the five looked at each other, and a surge of fighting spirit welled up in their hearts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Old Lan, can you control this magic treasure? Now is not the time for sparring! If you waste your energy, what will we do when the flying boat attacks later?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What, Old Guan, why are you ambushing me?" Xu Guan Hai exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though they forcibly suppressed their inner turmoil, the five of them couldn't help but fight each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu explained with some helplessness, "This treasure was personally passed down by the Grand Magus back then. Once entered, one will be forced to spar until they leave. It's the treasure's nature, uncontrollable. I didn't produce it before precisely because of this reason."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But it can adjust the sparring intensity, and I've already set it to the lowest. Everyone, don't suppress your fighting spirit; just spar casually, maintaining a state of combat. With the supplies we brought, we don't need to worry about energy consumption."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a flurry of frantic combat, the five gradually adapted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While lightly sparring, they also communicated harmoniously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This kind of warm-up is good; at least it ensures that we are in peak condition whenever we need to act," Xu Guan Hai said with forced cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Lu Chang sighed, "I haven't sparred with anyone like this in a long time. Please be gentle, fellow Daoists..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu returned to the main topic. "In this desperate situation, we only have one chance. Therefore, we must be aware of each other's strongest moves."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu's words were met with everyone's agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He spoke first, "My strongest strike is one I just realized in the Star Sea not long ago. It's called [Sword Splits the Galaxy]. Be careful!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Split Star Sword did not strike the other four, but instead fiercely struck the sky of the Martial Arts Arena.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The sky trembled, and cracks appeared, which then quickly healed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu exclaimed, "Good treasure!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other four then demonstrated their ultimate moves one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As they sparred, their mutual understanding also deepened.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They even jointly deduced a combined attack technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the void confinement formation, time passed without notice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The five Harmonious Dao cultivators seemed to be sharpening their swords, nurturing their vital energy and spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Waiting for the opportune moment to unleash their strongest strike.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After an unknown period...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A massive tremor disturbed them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't the trembling of the Martial Arts Arena, but the trembling of the entire dark void outside the arena.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Or rather, it originated from the Revered Venerable Flying Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With the prolonged cooperation in sparring, the five had already achieved a certain level of telepathic understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Instantly, they reached a consensus, waiting for an opening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Without warning, the darkness disappeared, and light reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They seemed to have returned to the flying boat's cabin.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, having suffered the consequences once, the five didn't hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They unleashed their ultimate combined attack, which they had painstakingly prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sword Splits the Galaxy!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Twilight Gazing Seas!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Feather Annihilation!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Shouts of fury echoed simultaneously, and five beams of light merged into one, fiercely striking the flying boat's wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, a scene that brought them despair appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A black hole inexplicably materialized on the wall, directly swallowing the immense destructive power of the five Harmonious Dao cultivators' combined attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The hole slowly healed, and the wall returned to its original state.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their painstakingly practiced ultimate moves were like a joke, causing not the slightest damage.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All five turned deathly pale.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu's Dao heart was shattered, and his figure swayed precariously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How is this possible?" he murmured in disbelief, unable to accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With their ultimate attacks having failed, the five felt their hearts turn to ash, with little hope of resistance left.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Revered Venerable Flying Boat trembled violently again, rousing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wrong? Is the flying boat being attacked from the outside?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Void calamity?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The five suddenly realized, their faces filled with joy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We still have a chance!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They also noticed the abnormality of the flying boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Heavenly Souls that had been absorbed before had not reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The flying boat also seemed to have undergone a fierce battle, with faint cracks visible on its walls.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the five stood in stunned silence, the cold voice of the Revered Venerable Flying Boat echoed again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Unknown Star Sea Civilization Battle 3."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Stored energy depleted."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After deduction, the probability of winning the upcoming battle is zero."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Executing backup plan..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Transmitting data..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Initiating flying boat self-destruction..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The flying boat's voice caused the five surviving Harmonious Dao cultivators to turn ashen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not good!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu instinctively unfolded his Martial Arts Arena, shrouding the five of them within it again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other four also deployed their respective techniques to protect themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Initiating... Star... Star..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, something even more astonishing happened. The Revered Venerable Flying Boat's voice seemed to be interfered with, stuttering, repeating itself. But no explosion occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From above the flying boat, another massive roar echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst billowing dust, a circular gap suddenly appeared. More than thirty mysterious beings clad in peculiar armor entered the gap in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They were well-trained, dividing into ten to surround Lan Yu and his companions. The rest continued to explore the interior of the flying boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Lan Yu, you are well-traveled. What is the current situation?" Xu Guan Hai transmitted telepathically, asking.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Guan Xing Xiu said with some uncertainty, "Unknown Star Sea civilization?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Possibly. Let's not act rashly for now; let's try to communicate first."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, the Revered Venerable Flying Boat, which they were helpless against, had been easily conquered by these mysterious individuals. Their strength was evident.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was better not to fight if they could avoid it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After some deliberation, Lan Yu spoke first, "Fellow Daoists, we have no ill intentions..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The response was swift, using the same language: "Enough nonsense, be quiet!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Liu, we can't break through their protective artifacts for now. Should we use the [Immortal Talisman] again?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No rush, just keep them contained. We'll figure out what to do after we drag this flying boat back."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal Talisman?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu and the others exchanged glances.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Time slowly passed in the bizarre atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Revered Venerable Flying Boat trembled slightly, breaking the stalemate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hoo... We can remove our defenses now." With a sigh of relief, another team of individuals arrived on the Revered Venerable Flying Boat and took over the area.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The leader was a long-haired man wearing a peculiar Daoist robe, with a broken black jade hairpin adorning his hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although this man exuded the same Harmonious Dao realm aura as Lan Yu and the others, it was mixed with another mysterious power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This caused the five Harmonious Dao cultivators from the Xuanhuang Realm to instinctively feel a sense of crisis.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if they were facing a terrifying calamity in the endless dark void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu and the others attempted to communicate with the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he seemed not to hear them, muttering to himself, "As Brother Zhao predicted, a ship was actually captured in that direction. This is something that hasn't happened in thousands of years."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Keep an eye on them!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu and the others were about to speak further when the long-haired man casually glanced at them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A character appeared ethereally in his pitch-black eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It appeared in Lan Yu and the others' minds, instantly filling their vision and senses, as if encompassing heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They could not see, nor could they hear.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Falling into endless darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And in the eyes of outsiders, it appeared as if the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator had merely glanced at them, and Lan Yu and the others were simply mesmerized, standing frozen in place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Silence fell upon the scene. After the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator left, the crowd began to whisper.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Elder Wang is getting stronger. Did you know these few were all genuine Harmonious Dao experts?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What Harmonious Dao, they don't understand the power of the [Immortal Talisman], what's the difference between them and us Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivators? Just a bit stronger."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That makes sense."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator returned in a hurry, and this captured flying boat would naturally be inspected by professionals.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the craftsmanship of this flying boat was indeed superb, it crucially lacked the power fluctuations of True Immortal Talismans.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, its true value was actually quite ordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator cared about was something else.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian from the Dao Proving Academy, had actually predicted the arrival of this flying boat from the depths of the Star Sea...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">How did he do it?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Could it be that he had secretly comprehended another True Immortal Talisman?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator touched the broken black jade hairpin on his head, unable to figure it out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Has this 'Wang Hai' finally begun to reveal his strength after being silent for seven or eight years?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"First, he broke through to Nascent Soul in a single day, then advanced to Harmonious Dao in the evening, completely shattering the understanding of cultivation speed within the Immortal Boat. Then, he comprehended a new True Immortal Talisman..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator hurried away from the Immortal Boat docking port and returned to the Immortal Severing Tower.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In a quiet, dimly lit secret room, the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator met Zhao Xian, who was also disheveled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Zhao," the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator said softly, devoid of his former arrogance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian ignored him, his eyes closed, lost in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Occasionally, he would draw lines in the void with his finger, muttering incantations.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After an unknown period, Zhao Xian finally spoke, "Have you found that flying boat?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Immortal Boat comes from the other side of the Star Sea, the former location of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Realm, like our Immortal Boat, has survived the great calamity. However, they have retained a considerable amount of resources..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A hint of shock flashed across the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator's face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian continued, "Unfortunately, the Xuanhuang Realm is too far from us. And it's too close to the Immortal Ruins."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sending an Immortal Boat there would be less cost-effective. Of course, the specific decision still rests with the Elder Council."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian said, handing a light spot to the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After examining the information in the light spot, the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator's breathing quickened.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Zhao, how did you perceive all this?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before leaving, the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator quietly asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian smiled slightly, "The Star Sea is vast, but to True Immortals, it is seen at a glance. Brother Wang, when you comprehended the True Immortal Talismans, did not visions appear in your mind?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai naturally wouldn't deny it, nodding, "I see. Brother Zhao truly possesses extraordinary talent."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian accepted it calmly and then handed over another light spot. "This is my new insight. After you review it, submit it to the Elder Council."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai received it like a treasure, instantly forgetting his previous displeasure and eagerly examining its contents.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wonderful, wonderful."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai was engrossed, completely immersed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only after a long time did the broken black jade hairpin on his head tremble slightly, as if it would break free at any moment. Wang Hai finally regained his senses.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Zhao is truly a great talent!" Wang Hai bowed sincerely and then left the area excitedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian, or rather Li Fan's Saint Embryo, watched Wang Hai depart, sensing the distorted figure under the influence of the True Immortal Talisman, a subtle smile appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the disparity in time flow, nine years had passed since Zhao Xian broke through to the Nascent Soul realm and was taken in as a core disciple by the Dao Proving Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The real Zhao Xian, influenced by the illusion created by Li Fan's Saint Embryo, remained anxious about the Xuan Merchant Immortal Boat being destroyed in the future. Even with Li Fan's help, his inner demons were rampant.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even as the divine sense Li Fan had split off was nearing depletion, his condition did not improve.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, due to repeated displays of abnormality, he was almost discovered by the Third Elder of the Academy, nearly exposing Li Fan's existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan also vaguely sensed the difference between the Xuan Merchant Immortal Boat and the Xuanhuang Realm in terms of cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Cultivators on the Immortal Boat, whether breaking through bottlenecks or cultivating daily, were extremely susceptible to inner demons.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These inner demons originated from the Dao of the Star Sea and directly afflicted the cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Each time Li Fan intercepted them for him, the inner demons appeared more frequently afterward.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And as Zhao Xian's actual cultivation realm strengthened, the power of these inner demons also grew.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, Li Fan stopped wasting his efforts on him and directly used the [Dao Pill] technique learned on the Xuan Merchant Immortal Boat on Zhao Xian.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Integrating divine sense and taking his place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Completely severing the possibility of inner demons appearing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian's own talent could only be described as mediocre.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, to Li Fan's surprise, after the Dao Pill was consumed, he, who had inherited Zhao Xian's body, also synchronously inherited the characteristics of the original inhabitants of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Similarly, with cultivation, he would also be plagued by inner demons.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But compared to Zhao Xian, Li Fan, having experienced many lifetimes, possessed a resilient will.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ordinary inner demons could not shake him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, there were no obstacles to his cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the plan, he infiltrated the Dao Proving Academy, greedily absorbing the technological accumulation of the Immortal Boat over centuries.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he volunteered to represent the Academy and came to the Immortal Severing Tower.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To learn and test the methods of harmlessly utilizing True Immortal Talismans mentioned by the Immortal Severing Tower.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What the Immortal Severing Tower said was not false.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They had indeed mastered the exquisite technique of using mortal cultivators' bodies to wield a portion of True Immortal power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like the Harmonious Dao cultivator Wang Hai, who had easily subdued Lan Yu and the other four with one move.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The key lay in the broken black jade hairpin he wore.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This hairpin was a remnant artifact of world destruction collected by the Immortal Boat from vast ruins. Over many years, influenced by True Immortal Talismans, its essence retained traces of the corresponding True Immortal Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, it was constantly buffeted by the Star Force echoing in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The collision of these two different True Immortal powers created the uniqueness of this black jade hairpin.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Realm's Divine Mechanism Hall, throughout the years, had mastered methods of [Entering Dao]. Although it was also through these remnant artifacts and comprehending the residual True Immortal Talismans, they chose artifacts influenced by only a single True Immortal power. The deeper one entered Dao, the stronger the constraint of the True Immortal Talisman. Not only would their bodies undergo terrifying changes, but even their minds would be affected, driving them mad.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Severing Tower unintentionally discovered remnant artifacts with traces of two True Immortal powers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They utilized one of them and used the echoing Star Force attached to it as an [Anchor]. When entering Dao too deeply, they could trace back the influence of the echoing Star Force and escape the Dao-entering realm. This method, although not reaching the extreme power of the Divine Mechanism Hall, offered safety, allowing it to be promoted to most cultivators. Even at the Nascent Soul realm, with the assistance of special remnant artifacts, after a period of training, they could instantly trigger and unleash the power of True Immortal Talismans. And if fighting in the Star Sea, where the surrounding environment had residual True Immortal Talisman power, its might would be terrifying and awe-inspiring, far exceeding the limits of ordinary Harmonious Dao cultivators of the Immortal Boat. Because of the proposal of this method, the Immortal Severing Tower later surpassed the Divine Mechanism Hall, becoming the nominal ruler of the Immortal Boat. However, considering that in extreme circumstances, the strength of seasoned [Dao-entering] cultivators would still be needed, the Divine Mechanism Hall was retained. Li Fan had also personally attempted [Entering Dao] with an anchor while disguised as Zhao Xian. But having witnessed the full power of True Immortal Talismans, how could he be satisfied with this mere shortcut? What he was interested in here was the research on different True Immortal Talismans. Because Immortal Boat cultivators could only infer the origin of True Immortal Talisman power through remnant artifacts, like blind men touching an elephant. Each cultivator, based on their different perceptions, would diverge into various insights. Li Fan, having witnessed it firsthand, could select the correct versions from a pile of speculations. Naturally, he disregarded the complete characters like 'Hunger,' 'Chaos,' and 'Non-existence' that he had already seen. The [Solitary] encountered during his traverse of the Star Sea, and the [Fallen] and [Nothingness]... This truly was a treasure trove for Li Fan. True Immortal Talismans, although differing in their manifestation of power, were all created by the [Inscription Dao Immortal]. In a sense, they shared commonalities. Having mastered four or five correct answers, Li Fan could more easily find versions closer to the truth from the research of the Immortal Severing Tower. This was the fundamental reason why he could continuously submit so-called "insights" as Zhao Xian. In fact, it was not unworthy of being called True Immortal Talismans; even reverse-engineered versions could rival the killing techniques of cultivators. Li Fan's Saint Embryo practicing outside the Immortal Boat caused him to secretly marvel at the destruction. And among the vast literature of the Immortal Severing Tower, what fascinated Li Fan the most was the speculative research on the classification of True Immortal Talismans.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-293" class="calibre1">Chapter 1282: Secret Treasure of a Thousand Fables</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In this life, Li Fan had also attempted to categorize the True Immortal script he had encountered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that was from the perspective of their specific divine abilities, such as destruction, decree, augmentation, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Broken Immortal Tower, beyond the Star Sea, it was from another novel perspective.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is: whether the Dao depicted by the True Immortal script had already been occupied by a True Immortal, or had been occupied by a True Immortal in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the descriptions in various documents within the Broken Immortal Tower, the difficulty and danger level of cultivating into the Dao using these different types of True Immortal script were entirely incomparable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a True Immortal had already occupied the Dao, any mortal who attempted to enter the Dao through the script would instantly turn to ash and vanish without a trace the moment they "obtained the Dao." Even the most powerful or talented individuals could not avoid this fate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the Dao was no longer occupied by a True Immortal, then even with some side effects, mortals could glimpse the grand Dao depicted by the True Immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan carefully pondered the scattered insights of his predecessors that he could read based on his current "contributions."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The method of replicating and attempting to depict the True Immortal script was fundamentally different. The Broken Immortal Tower and the entire Xuán Xiān Zhōu (Mysterious Immortal Boat) relied on the World-Extinguishing Artifact to trigger the residual immortal energy, rather than directly using the power of the True Immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The so-called "entering the Dao" was not truly entering the path of a True Immortal. It was more like integrating the body, divine soul, and consciousness into the World-Extinguishing Artifact, acquiring certain characteristics born from its tempering by time, and thus being able to better trigger the residual immortal energy in the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Undoubtedly, this was a method of taking shortcuts. If the environment changed and there were no such abundant residual immortal energy in the Star Sea, even if one could "enter the Dao," the power displayed would surely be greatly weakened. Li Fan's method of replicating the fundamental shape of the True Immortal script, regardless of the location limitations, only depended on the practitioner's own strength and understanding of the True Immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, this was only Li Fan's current understanding, having personally witnessed the True Immortal script. The people of the Immortal Boat would likely never approve. Unless Li Fan was willing to share the fundamental shape of the True Immortal script. With the accumulation of the Immortal Boat over thousands of years, if they could see the true form of the True Immortal script, the overall strength of the Immortal Boat would likely leap forward in a short period of time…</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan was not foolish enough to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was better to continue as he was, submitting "insights" from time to time in exchange for contributions, which was easier and safer. After all, these were reflections on the true 【True Immortal Script】; even if the angle was bizarre, it was absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the essential difference that allows one to witness the true transmission. They rack their brains, trying to replicate the origin from all the external appearances of the True Immortal script. But I was fortunate enough to witness the true origin early on, and deriving from the top down is naturally smooth and effortless."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Li Fan firmly believed that the method of the Immortal Boat was merely a clever shortcut, it could not be denied that for ants like them below the True Immortal level, it was entirely worthwhile to be able to wield the power that originally belonged to True Immortals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, survival was the top priority.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If not for these research achievements on the True Immortal script, the Xuán Xiān Zhōu would have long ago become another member of the endless ruins in the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, Li Fan guided the Xuán Xiān Zhōu to capture the Myriad Immortals Alliance's flying ship, not only to accumulate some merit for this body but also, more importantly, to use the mouths of the Harmonious Dao cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance to leak the existence of the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After lurking within the Xuán Xiān Zhōu for so long, Li Fan finally understood the identity of the mysterious cultivator he encountered in the Sea of Artifacts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were all once members of the Xuán Xiān Zhōu, and even among its highest authorities. However, several hundred years ago, they were incited by some outsider and, without anyone knowing what secret agreement was reached, they allowed this outsider to enter the Immortal Boat's top-secret 【Hundred Revelations Immortal Record】.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This outsider claimed only to borrow ancient secret records, but after entering, they never came out until the agreed-upon time. The people of the Immortal Boat, sensing something was wrong, hastily checked and were horrified to find that many secret treasures in the 【Hundred Revelations Immortal Record】 had disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Coincidentally, the outsider and the three Harmonious Dao cultivators who were responsible for guarding the area also disappeared without anyone noticing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat was shaken, and those in authority were purged, leading to a small-scale internal conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The final outcome was that a small portion of people escaped the Immortal Boat. However, these people were unwilling to give up on the Immortal Boat, and coupled with the vastness of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, there was nowhere else to go, so they also lurked in the Sea of Artifacts, hoping to counterattack one day and return to the Xuán Xiān Zhōu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the Immortal Boat, although they never stopped pursuing these fugitives, how could it be easy to capture them in the vast Star Sea?</p>
<p class="calibre2">They could only let these people exist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone on the Immortal Boat harbored resentment towards the outsider who caused this internal strife. The lost secret treasures were an eternal pain in the hearts of the people of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the outsider's identity was extremely mysterious, and perhaps only those Immortal Boat rebels might know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since that incident, that person had never appeared again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Li Fan was not certain whether this outsider was truly the Dharma-Transmitter, it did not prevent him from creating the "possibility" that they were the same person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, in the current Utmost Darkness Star Sea, external resources were scarce, and there were not many living people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Near the High Wall, and yet so mysterious…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides the Dharma-Transmitter, who else could it be?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan believed that if the people of the Immortal Boat learned that far away in the Sea of Remnants, a powerful being who was likely an ancient enemy was constantly hiding, they would definitely try to investigate the truth there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, it was an unchanging principle that one could not tolerate others sleeping soundly beside their own bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan could use the Xuán Xiān Zhōu to probe the true strength of the Dharma-Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He did not expect to achieve anything substantial, but even a sliver of information would be good. Anyway, for Li Fan, it was just a casual push, with no cost at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ultimately, victory might be built upon these inconspicuous pieces of intelligence. The Immortal Boat and the Saint Emperor are both chess pieces I use for testing."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan reread a piece of literature, thinking this to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the encounter with the Harmonious Dao cultivators of the Immortal Alliance, it was not even within his consideration. After all, in the Xuán Huáng Realm, they were also mere consumables.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But what Li Fan did not expect was that three days later, the long-haired Harmonious Dao cultivator Wang Hai returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also brought back a record of interrogation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Zhao, take a look. The events on this flying ship are truly spectacular."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan scanned it and frowned slightly: "Is this flying ship so strong? Harmonious Dao cultivators are like food dough..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai nodded: "We fought it three times before finally breaking through its defenses. And we consumed quite a few World-Extinguishing Artifacts."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But it was worth it. The resources carried by each Harmonious Dao cultivator were extravagant. Not to mention, those things called 【Essence of Heaven and Earth】 stored inside the flying ship..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan raised his eyebrows slightly, pretending to be ignorant: "What exactly is this Essence of Heaven and Earth? Is it the actualization of world laws?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai smiled: "If it were just that, I wouldn't be so excited or have traveled so far to bring you good news! This so-called Essence of Heaven and Earth, in addition to the power of laws in the cultivation world, also attaches a considerable portion of the fundamental power that constructs the world."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the cultivation world is compared to a house, then this Essence of Heaven and Earth can be seen as the main beams that build the house! And this is precisely what our Xuán Xiān Zhōu lacks! With the replenishment of these 'fuels,' our Immortal Boat can operate smoothly for another hundred years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">From Wang Hai's voice, one could undoubtedly hear his inner joy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He continued to ramble: "Even the flying ship itself can be dismantled and used to add bricks and tiles to our Immortal Boat. Brother Zhao's foresight this time has brought the Immortal Boat a harvest comparable to dozens of World-Extinguishing Artifacts!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan continued to read the document with his head lowered: "I only care about the specific rewards. By the way, what did the Elder Council of that world called the Xuán Huáng Realm say? Although the fat meat is a bit far away, it can still save lives."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai shrugged his shoulders: "You know those people from the Elder Council. They always use 'the big picture' and 'the future of the Immortal Boat' as excuses. Expeditions across the Star Sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I think we'll only do that when our Immortal Boat is truly at its last resort."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded thoughtfully: "It's a pity. I vaguely saw that Harmonious Dao cultivators like the ones on the flying ship are already the peak combat power of the Xuán Huáng Realm. There are only a handful of more powerful Longevity Realm cultivators. If our Immortal Boat were to arrive, they would have no power to resist..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai nodded in agreement, full of disdain: "They are nothing more than parasites clinging to the surviving cultivation worlds. I think even without the full might of the Immortal Boat, just three to five Dao-Entrants would be enough to easily suppress the Xuán Huáng Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai sighed again, somewhat regretfully: "It's a pity the Elder Council doesn't allow it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not respond, and asked again: "What will my reward be? Don't tell me the Elder Council won't acknowledge such a great contribution?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only then did Wang Hai stop beating around the bush and cautiously produced a jade slip.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the jade slip appeared, Li Fan's gaze sharpened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He keenly noticed that the half-broken jade hairpin on Wang Hai's head trembled incessantly. And the jade slip itself faintly emitted the power fluctuations of True Immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan quickly reacted: "The jade slip itself is a World-Extinguishing Artifact?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai said somewhat proudly: "That's right. This is considered the third 【World-Extinguishing Jade Slip】 our Immortal Boat has collected. Every time one observes this World-Extinguishing Jade Slip, a portion of the True Immortal power attached to it is consumed, so it is exceptionally precious. The Elder Council has really bled dry this time."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is recorded in this jade slip?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I want to know too, but I don't have the qualification. You'll know when you look at it yourself. Hurry up, after you're done reading, I need to take it back." Wang Hai looked enviously at the jade slip in Li Fan's hand and urged him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then solemnly separated a wisp of his divine sense and entered it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The World-Extinguishing Jade Slip was an extremely special type of World-Extinguishing Artifact.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike ordinary magic treasures, due to the constant immersion of True Immortal power over the years, although the World-Extinguishing Jade Slip itself would not be imbued with the power of True Immortal script, the True Immortal power would permeate the content recorded in the jade slip.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Causing a certain "mutation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or rather, sublimation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sublimated content, as if guided by a True Immortal, had undergone a qualitative leap.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mortal techniques transformed into True Immortal techniques. Even a simple article, after being touched by True Immortal power, would become something from which one could gain enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, the World-Extinguishing Jade Slip was currently one of the rare ways to safely and closely contact a 【True Immortal】.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his divine sense entered the World-Extinguishing Jade Slip, the original content of the jade slip first poured in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An ordinary technique for tempering the will. Judging by its rank, it was at most at the Nascent Soul stage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After finishing the reading in an instant, the perception of his divine sense suddenly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The originally ordinary characters instantly came alive, twisted, and mutated, transforming into new characters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After further rearranging their positions, a brand new immortal technique instantly appeared on the "page."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan trembled inwardly and quickly read the new technique several times carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sense of familiarity and unfamiliarity gradually arose in his heart as his understanding deepened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal Heart Curse?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But it's not from the Xuán Huáng Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And... there are still subtle differences. After all, it wasn't truly deduced and personally transmitted by a True Immortal, but rather derived by the jade slip itself. It can even be considered a weakened version of the Xuán Huáng Immortal Heart Curse." Li Fan thought regretfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, on his face, he still maintained an appearance of excitement and immersion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the moving characters in his mind slowly faded and finally disappeared completely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan reluctantly returned the World-Extinguishing Jade Slip and said, "As expected of an Immortal technique. With this method, I can be free from heart demons in the future. Even the negative influences when comprehending True Immortal script will be greatly reduced."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And thank the elders for me!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing this, Wang Hai glanced at the World-Extinguishing Jade Slip in his hand. Then, he forcibly suppressed the urge to peek.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Setting aside the elder council's restrictions that prevented him from peeking. Stealing without permission was a major taboo of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even he, if he committed such an offense, would only end up as living material for studying immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I could not have achieved this harvest without your long-term efforts in connecting me, Brother Zhao. Here are my insights. Please accept them." Li Fan saw his expression and closed his eyes slightly, concentrating, and then engraved another jade slip on the spot, handing it over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai was overjoyed at this: "Thank you, Brother Zhao! From now on, I'll go through fire and water for you without hesitation!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">After exchanging pleasantries, he directly took the jade slip and began to read it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immersed in it, his face lit up with joy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, returning to his senses from the insights, Wang Hai crushed the jade slip engraved by Li Fan into pieces right in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the rule of knowledge transmission within the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although there was no restriction on not being able to cultivate the same techniques, techniques, divine abilities, and various insights were still extremely precious resources.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like the World-Extinguishing Jade Slip rewarded by the Broken Immortal Tower Elder Council this time, only Li Fan was qualified to observe it; it could not be lent to others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, after Li Fan had finished observing, and then passed on his own insights, there were no such restrictions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But after all, it was a second-hand transmission. The effect would definitely be far less than experiencing it firsthand. Especially when it involved True Immortal power, even if the written transmission was exactly the same, not being able to feel the evolution of profound power, the cultivation progress, or the subtlety of enlightenment would naturally be much weaker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unless one was a heavenly talent who could ignore this natural gap. Otherwise, those who were the second or third generation of transmitters would all be weaker than the first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Precisely because of adhering to this rule, Wang Hai crushed the jade slip engraved by Li Fan after reading it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After he left today, he would have the right to disseminate this technique again. However, it would be a third-generation transmission, and its effect would be further weakened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If any interested party wished to cultivate this technique further, they would need to follow the path of transmission, go against the flow, pay a certain price, and beg the previous transmitter. Whether they could obtain the true technique would depend on their sincerity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had been lurking in the Xuán Xiān Zhōu for over ten years and was already well aware of its rules.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing that Wang Hai had received the gift of a jade slip of insights, the two bid farewell reluctantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, the five living Harmonious Dao cultivators from the Xuán Huáng Realm, one of them has something strange about him. So the Elder Council, out of caution, hasn't made a move yet. If you're interested, perhaps you can go find out about him." Wang Hai left this ambiguous remark before finally departing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan couldn't help but ponder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the rules of the Immortal Boat, such a subtle suggestion would only be made when it involved the upper echelons of the Immortal Boat or the faction behind the other party.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Survivor..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It should be Lan Yu! After all, he's the only one who cultivates the Ancient Law Harmonious Dao, and he's worthless to the Immortal Boat. But there's nothing strange about him at all..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Grand Heavenly Master Du?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a train of thought, Li Fan tidied his slightly messy clothes and headed towards the direction of the Broken Immortal Tower Elder Council.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The entire Xuán Xiān Zhōu was currently built on a Void Divine Tree, and after the Broken Immortal Tower gained actual control of the Immortal Boat, it moved to the top of the Void Divine Tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Traces of green light, like the tips of branches, connected the various buildings of the Broken Immortal Tower.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Walking on air, without needing to fly, he just needed to move his mind, and he could travel between different locations using the green light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking down, one could vaguely see the Dao Proving Academy, the Star Forging Workshop, and the newly built Sin Subduing Valley below the giant divine tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They seemed to float in the endless void, connected by the divine tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The giant that Li Fan saw earlier, who had been pierced through the center of his body by the divine tree, had been completely drained. Now, a giant rabbit had taken its place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This rabbit had a white body and black ears, with a human-like face. Although it was dead, its expression was still compassionate, as if it had witnessed something extremely heartbreaking before its demise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This 【Human Sovereign Rabbit】, like the previous 【Path-Chaser】 giant, was a part of the Xuán Xiān Zhōu's 【Hundred Revelations Immortal Record】 secret collection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The treasures collected in the secret collection not only came from the prosperous cultivation era before the destruction of the Star Sea, but also included many strange items collected by the Xuán Xiān Zhōu over the past thousands of years of drifting in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's gaze inadvertently swept over the drying body of the Human Sovereign Rabbit, his thoughts drifting to the Immortal Boat's secret collection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If there was anything on the Immortal Boat worth him plotting for, it was probably this 【Hundred Revelations Immortal Record】.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, plus the whereabouts of the other half, the Shang Immortal Boat."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly thought this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a part of the former Xuán Shāng Immortal Boat, although the Xuán and Shāng had lost contact for a long time, they could still occasionally sense each other's existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, any information about the Shāng Immortal Boat was the highest secret of the Xuán Xiān Zhōu. Even the Broken Immortal Tower Elder Council only had the three core members qualified to know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, having infiltrated for more than ten years, only managed to overhear one or two sentences during an occasional eavesdropping of an Elder meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I wonder what the specific situation of the Shāng Immortal Boat is. It's so secret that it's even more confidential than the True Immortal script..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Li Fan was pondering, he had already arrived at the very top of the Void Divine Tree, where the Broken Immortal Tower Elder Council resided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first thing Li Fan did was naturally to visit his "teacher."</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Xuán Xiān Zhōu, lineage and faction were highly valued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai repeatedly ran errands and relayed messages for him precisely because Li Fan and Wang Hai both studied under the third elder of the Broken Immortal Tower, Ai Tian Jue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Ai Tian Jue's relationship with Li Fan was even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Ai Tian Jue also originated from the Dao Proving Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, in order to research new methods of entering the Dao, he had joined the Broken Immortal Tower after leaving the academy and had kept a low profile, unknown to most people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't until he achieved results and the Broken Immortal Tower usurped control of the Immortal Boat that Ai Tian Jue reappeared in the public eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Greetings, Master." Li Fan maintained a calm expression and bowed, then truthfully explained his insights from the World-Extinguishing Jade Slip he had just received to his teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Any gains made by a disciple must be reported and submitted to the teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was naturally also a rule of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After listening to Li Fan's explanation, Ai Tian Jue nodded slightly: "I have also seen this jade slip. Your talent is indeed extraordinary; you have already grasped seven to eight tenths of its essence."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan bowed respectfully again, thanking his teacher for his praise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But do not rely on it too much." Ai Tian Jue's tone suddenly shifted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You must know that heart demons are both tribulations and opportunities. Even if you can use marvelous methods to eliminate heart demons, heart demons are endless and will reappear. Using the Immortal Heart Curse to pacify them is ultimately an inferior approach."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is better to transform them into resources for tempering oneself; it will be more beneficial for cultivation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tian Jue spoke slowly and unhurriedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While teaching Li Fan, he was also writing something on a piece of white paper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected of one of the top powerhouses in the Broken Immortal Tower, even his mere words could inspire the current Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan listened attentively, never once attempting to glimpse the content of Ai Tian Jue's writing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After Ai Tian Jue finished his lecture, he still did not stop writing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not until half a day later that he finally put down his brush.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Take a look at this piece of writing. How is it?" Ai Tian Jue said to Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only then did Li Fan look up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the white paper, there was a "complete" True Immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was Li Fan's first reaction upon seeing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fall..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Focusing further, Li Fan felt a sense of loss: "It's not a complete True Immortal script. It only restored about eighty to ninety percent."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, to comprehend this level from a pile of fragments is truly extraordinary..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan thought to himself that he, alone, would definitely not have been able to achieve this level.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan expressed his insights on the character 【Fall】: "This 'fall' is not a fall of the heart and mind. It is the fundamental fall of all things. A descent from a higher level to a lower level."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"True Immortals become cultivators, cultivators become mortals, and mortals turn to dust..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just with a single character, Li Fan's insights lasted for more than half a day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And it was still far from complete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Li Fan finished, Ai Tian Jue first pointed out a few fallacies in Li Fan's words, then sighed slightly: "To comprehend the words of a True Immortal is like watching a racehorse."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This script 'Fall,' the Immortal Boat had already restored sixty to seventy percent a thousand years ago. After a thousand years, the progress has only increased by a fraction."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The closer one gets to the true meaning of True Immortal script, the slower the progress becomes. And even if there is only a slight difference, compared to the real True Immortal script, the power is vastly different."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"One can see the path ahead, but cannot tread it. The immortal path, how difficult it is!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan felt a sense of strangeness upon hearing Ai Tian Jue's sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This did not sound like something his master, who was a research fanatic, would say.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, why do you say that?" Li Fan asked directly, without concealment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tian Jue then explained the origin of his words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That Harmonious Dao cultivator from the Xuán Huáng Realm, Lan Yu, cultivates a true immortal technique."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Myriad Tribulations Feather Transformation Art..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I yearn for it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tian Jue sighed again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as these words were uttered, Li Fan was greatly shaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He knew how high his master's standards were. Since he called it a true immortal technique, it should be a genuine immortal-level cultivation technique, just like the Xuán Huáng Immortal Heart Curse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But…</p>
<p class="calibre2">How is this possible?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lan Yu?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Didn't he cultivate the 【Great Heavenly Feather Transformation Art】?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, Li Fan's eyes narrowed, and countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, his verbal response was not slow: "Since Lan Yu has fallen into our Immortal Boat's hands, doesn't this immortal technique essentially belong to our Immortal Boat?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, where is your regret?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">He pretended to be confused and asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tian Jue smiled and shook his head: "The Xuán Huáng Realm has the restriction of 'law cannot be cultivated simultaneously.' Although the Immortal Boat is far from the Xuán Huáng Realm and is not bound by this restriction, Lan Yu's immortal technique also has a similar limitation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To cultivate the Myriad Tribulations Feather Transformation Art, one needs the 【Feather of Myriad Tribulations】 as a guide. Without this treasure, no matter how astonishing one's talent, one cannot even begin."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Feather of Myriad Tribulations has already merged with Lan Yu; it is not something we can separate."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, even though the immortal technique is before our eyes, we can only look, not cultivate!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tian Jue shook his head again: "This situation is quite similar to the only record of an immortal technique in our Xuán Xiān Zhōu's secret collection."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan also put on a thoughtful expression: "Not only techniques, but True Immortal scripts, are they also like this? Occupied by a True Immortal, so others cannot cultivate..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tian Jue waved his hand, putting away the writing on the table, his expression unreadable: "That's why that day, I suddenly had a feeling that perhaps not fully comprehending this True Immortal script was a good thing after all."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Otherwise, within the Immortal Boat, there would inevitably be more bloodshed."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan fell silent upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Speaking of which, the origin of the Xuán Huáng Realm's 'law cannot be cultivated simultaneously' rule is quite interesting." Ai Tian Jue suddenly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at his master.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He saw that Ai Tian Jue was writing something on a white paper, muttering to himself: "This restriction should be unique to the Immortal Realm. It should not be derivable by a lower realm's Heavenly Dao..."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-294" class="calibre1">Chapter 1283: First Trial of the Spiritual Void Array</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's expression immediately turned astonished. "How could this be? Could it be that this Xuanhuang Realm has some connection to the mythical Immortal Realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tianjue's tone was enigmatic. "Heh heh, it's hard to say, hard to say! The history of this Xuanhuang Realm is quite interesting. Once we delve deeper into Lan Yu's mind and extract more, perhaps those old fellows will change their minds." "I just don't know if it will be good or bad for our Immortal Boat."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After speaking, Ai Tianjue was silent for a moment before officially beginning his lesson for Li Fan. Li Fan's repeated calls of "Master" were not in vain. With no restrictions of "laws cannot be cultivated simultaneously," what was passed down between master and disciple here were true profound techniques.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had been Ai Tianjue's disciple for five years and, having gained his approval, was taught the "Jade Void Inner Scenery Weeping Spirit Art." This profound technique was precisely the fundamental cultivation method that Ai Tianjue himself practiced.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Kan and Li reverse the Qian and Kun, the Jade Void Profound Art is miraculous. The Azure Sea refines the void, and weeping spirits transform into divine abilities…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded in agreement. The essence of the cultivation method was to construct an inner scenery world within one's own divine soul. This Jade Void Inner Scenery Weeping Spirit Art was a supreme divine ability passed down through the generations of the Profound Immortal Boat. It was said to have been exchanged by the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat from a sect in a cultivation realm with a supreme treasure during the era when the Immortal path was still open. Over time, everything within the inner scenery world would move according to one's will.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It advocated discarding all foundational cultivation techniques and directly dedicating oneself to the True Immortal script. Unlike Ai Tianjue's somewhat "traditional" approach, Elder Chi Gongdao was an undeniable radical on the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan bowed respectfully and took his leave. At the same time, he thought to himself, "A teacher treats his students with sincerity, and a student repays his teacher with honesty. This is the true inheritance that has allowed the Profound Immortal Boat to continue for thousands of years. The Immortal Pivot Hall and the Immortal Severing Tower are merely different skins. The true core remains these master-disciple lineages."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This method of teaching was actually a common teaching technique on the Immortal Boat. Cultivating within the inner scenery world, weeping spirits in cultivation. Weeping, meaning crying. Although Li Fan did not have a formal master-disciple relationship with Elder Chi, due to Li Fan's multiple submissions of unique insights on True Immortal script, he had gained his appreciation. Thus, his status within the Immortal Severing Tower and the entire Immortal Boat was extremely extraordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The people of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat, constantly traveling through the Star Sea and visiting various cultivation worlds, had no fixed abode and found it difficult to truly cultivate with a calm mind. The Weeping Spirit Art, however, perfectly solved these two pain points. Ai Tianjue held a glowing book, slowly reciting the contents of the Jade Void Inner Scenery Weeping Spirit Art. Ai Tianjue nodded slightly, his gaze filled with approval. "After you return, you must read it daily and not neglect it. Your Weeping Spirit Art has reached a critical juncture. Once the inner scenery world takes shape, with your thoughts moving instantaneously, you might catch up to me within half a year."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tianjue was one of the top experts in the Immortal Severing Tower, and his research on True Immortal script was quite profound. His capabilities were doubtless. After more than half a day, Ai Tianjue finally finished reciting the Weeping Spirit Art. He let out a long sigh, and the sweat on his forehead instantly evaporated. The teaching effect of "Sentience of All Beings" was closely related to the aptitude and comprehension abilities of the teacher and student. Moreover, Chi Gongdao had a secret technique passed down, where he could precisely locate valuable World-Extinguishing Artifacts from the vast sea of residual artifacts that contained scattered True Immortal power that was about to dissipate and could be utilized by Immortal Boat cultivators. It was said that eight or nine out of ten double-True Immortal power artifacts found by the Immortal Severing Tower were discovered by Elder Chi Gongdao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For other cultivation methods, as one's realm increased, the cultivation speed would gradually slow down. However, the Weeping Spirit Art was slow in the early stages, requiring experience and the establishment of an emotional connection with one's inner scenery world. The later the stage, the faster the cultivation became. Although it had been countless years since Li Fan last cried, for Li Tang Master, who could turn the false into the real, recreating the emotional fluctuations of crying was not difficult. Coupled with the fact that the body Li Fan had possessed, Zhao Xian, was not lacking in aptitude, and Li Fan's vast knowledge from his many reincarnations, his progress in cultivating the Weeping Spirit Art was rapid.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tianjue further instructed, "Although the mainstream view on the Immortal Boat is that studying True Immortal script is fundamental, you must also remember that realm and strength are the basis for exploration and enlightenment. If the foundation is unstable, even if you are lucky enough to reach the heavens temporarily, you risk falling to your death at any time…" The Weeping Spirit Art did not require seclusion; even a short period could deepen the emotional connection with the inner scenery world. Furthermore, the more active one's mind and the more sensitive their emotions, the more suitable they were for cultivating it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Are there any unclear points?" Ai Tianjue asked. Or rather, it was more like a divine ability than a cultivation method, called "Sentience of All Beings." And Li Fan, meanwhile, kept his eyes closed, as if still immersed in Ai Tianjue's teachings. Chi Gongdao. Although he was merely reciting words, without detailed explanations, with Ai Tianjue's modulated voice, like the laws of the Great Dao, entering Li Fan's ears, Li Fan's mind naturally conjured up many of Ai Tianjue's insights into the "Weeping Spirit Art." It was said to have been scoured from the Sea of Remnants by the Immortal Boat, greatly reducing the difficulty of inheritance and teaching on the Immortal Boat. Upon its release, it was widely acclaimed and popular throughout the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Li Fan's assessment, among the elders of the Immortal Severing Tower, he was the one who had reproduced the True Immortal script the most, and also the one with the highest degree of accuracy. He turned to pay a visit to another elder. To be honest, Chi Gongdao's research on True Immortal script did have some aspects that were beyond others. Ai Tianjue was rambling, even seeming a bit verbose. However, this was precisely the level that every teacher on the Profound Immortal Boat strived to achieve. Weeping Spirit, not necessarily weeping during cultivation, but imitating the natural and smooth feeling that arises from the heart when one naturally cries. After leaving Ai Tianjue's room, Li Fan did not leave the Immortal Severing Tower immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan also silently recited along. "Student understands everything." Li Fan replied in a deep voice. He did not know how fast the cultivation speed of Ai Tianjue's other disciples was, but judging from the fact that he was always given private lessons each time, it was enough to show Ai Tianjue's importance to Li Fan. Hoo hoo… As soon as Li Fan pushed open the door of the small building, a gust of cold wind accompanied by low whispers met him. As if accustomed to it, Li Fan directly ignored it, walked straight to Chi Gongdao, and sat down quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In front of him, a brush made of flesh and hair immediately appeared. Li Fan reached out to take the brush, and before he even got close, the hair on the brush seemed to come alive. It rapidly elongated and firmly bound Li Fan's right hand. The incomplete True Immortal script appeared in his sea of consciousness, moving with his hand. Drops of blood flowed from the tip of the brush, condensing into ink, leaving indelible marks in the air. To be honest, when Li Fan first came here, he almost revealed himself and nearly wrote the complete True Immortal script. If he hadn't reacted in time, the Immortal Boat would likely have been reduced to nothingness under the world-destroying power of the True Immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The brush moved like flying dragons and dancing snakes, spitting out red blood. Before long, a fragmented and distorted True Immortal character appeared in this place. It was the character "Hunger". "Hunger… hunger… hunger… hunger!" The brush in his hand suddenly roared, and the缠绕 hair tightened even more. Most of it directly turned into wriggling worms, trying to burrow into Li Fan's body through his hand, devouring his flesh and blood. Li Fan narrowed his eyes, not activating his physical strength or spiritual power to expel them. Instead, while his flesh was being devoured, he felt the hunger of the hair. He was not greedy; the hair merely took a cursory taste and then quickly retracted. The brush flew out of his hand and returned to the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A moment later, a strange chewing sound echoed. Occasionally interspersed with the crisp sound of chewing bones. Chi Gongdao's voice simultaneously came, "Not bad. Compared to last time, the flavor is a bit more pure." "Young Zhao, you are truly a genius. If Elder Ai were willing, how could I not take you as a disciple?" Li Fan did not reply, but said in a deep voice, "Elder Chi, I feel that my understanding of this character has reached a bottleneck. I want to try a new one." Chi Gongdao let out a sinister laugh, "Heh heh, greedy. I like it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Swish! Seven brushes made of flesh and hair also flew out of the darkness and appeared before Li Fan. "Choose whichever one you want!" Li Fan closed his eyes, sensing the aura emanating from the different brushes. "This one." After a long time, Li Fan decided on his target and reached out towards the leftmost brush, the one with the dimmest flesh. Flesh churned, black hair attached itself, guiding Li Fan's hand to write in the void. With flying strokes, a blood-red True Immortal character slowly emerged. Li Fan concentrated on comprehending it, while the other six brushes had already disappeared at some unknown time. "Alone." "The Myriad Ages and the Heavens, only this body is alone."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the Saint Embryo Li Fan traversed the Star Sea, he had encountered this True Immortal script. At that time, even the Black Sword Heaven's Wonder, which had merged with his Dao foundation, had a tendency to be separated. And now, Li Fan felt that same power from the blood-red character in front of him. However, there were faint restrictions in the surrounding space, curbing the emission of power from "Alone" and other manifested True Immortal scripts. In Li Fan's perception, time passed both slowly and rapidly. After the character "Alone" was finished writing, he still felt unsatisfied. This process of inferring from the manifested power without seeing the True Immortal script itself was truly fascinating. The brush wrapped around his hand had returned to the darkness. Chi Gongdao's sinister laughter echoed in Li Fan's ears again, "Young Zhao, do you want to experience it again? If you abandon the darkness and embrace the light, and come from Elder Ai to me, I will guarantee to hand over all these True Immortal scripts that I have speculated to you hand-in-hand…" Li Fan's expression remained unchanged. "Thank you for your concern, Elder. If I have the need, I will still exchange my insights for it." Without waiting for Chi Gongdao's response, he turned and left.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The small building fell silent for a moment, and Chi Gongdao's voice rang out again, "His will is firm. I like it even more…" "Heh heh heh heh…" Chi Gongdao, who was coveting Li Fan, did not know that with just one direct experience, Li Fan's understanding of "Alone" had already surpassed his. After all, he had the advantage of having personally seen the True Immortal script and having been attacked by the residual power of the "Alone" technique. It was understandable that Li Fan had quickly surpassed him and could now derive it himself. "I'll try to see if I can reproduce it on my own. If I fail, I'll rely on these geniuses of the Immortal Boat." "After all, the more True Immortal script powers one masters, the better." Li Fan returned to his residence and tidied up the gains he had obtained from Ai Tianjue and Chi Gongdao. And waited for their next summons. His life on the Profound Immortal Boat was simple, unadorned, and monotonous.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The attention of the Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators on the outbound rainbow light remained high. Although the frequency had slightly decreased, the Myriad Immortals Alliance officially still released some images from the Utmost Darkness Star Sea from time to time! The various dangerous calamities made the cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm exclaim with excitement. "Just watch. They can always escape misfortune every time, which is a blessing from the Heavenly Venerate. But we might not have such luck." "No wonder the Immortal Alliance was unwilling to send people to the Star Sea before. It's too dangerous. We haven't even seen the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat yet, and several Harmonious Dao cultivators have already perished. How many will safely return in the end?" "The Immortal Boat is good, but it's not our home!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the heated discussions, the Saint Emperor Li Ping had already spotted some clues. After all, he had truly traversed the Star Sea. The images released by the Myriad Immortals Alliance, although appearing real, still had many flaws compared to traversing the Star Sea. "The Myriad Immortals Alliance is faking it?" "It seems the true outbound rainbow light has already met with misfortune." Li Ping said with some regret. At this moment, the Sacred Dynasty had gathered enough Empty Light Flowing Crystals again. He was going to personally go outside the Xuanhuang Realm, not only to comprehend the Dao again but also to familiarize himself with the battlefield environment where he would eventually confront the Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the sky, unnoticed, the Saint Emperor had already flown to the borders of the Xuanhuang Realm. This time, Li Ping refused the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's request to accompany him. After all, he would not be going far this time, only operating around the Xuanhuang Realm. As the layers of rainbow light separated, he began to break free from the Immortal Ruins' suction and fly into the dark void. "Perhaps, it is not necessary to rely on these Empty Light Flowing Crystals." "Xuanhuang creations, the embodiment of Xuanhuang laws. Its characteristics, perhaps, can be mimicked through spiritual power." Looking at the colorful, hazy light around him, Li Ping mused. The Xuanhuang Realm gradually turned into a small dot, invisible. Li Fan then turned his gaze towards the location of the Immortal Ruins. It was a place of darkness. The ruins of the former Immortal Realm passage swallowed all eyes that tried to pry.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A fleeting, blurry image flashed in his mind. For some reason, Li Ping felt a faint sense of familiarity towards the mysterious Immortal Ruins. Although it was fleeting, it was still captured by the Saint Emperor. "Immortal Ruins…" Li Ping shook his head, and after a long time, suppressed the thought. The immediate priority was to resolve the issue of the Xuanhuang Realm being "taken over" and having its landscape changed. As for how to escape the Immortal Ruins after achieving his goal…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Since that day, after learning from Mo Ru Bin about the unique nature of the Abyssal race, which originated from the bloodline of the first Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate. Li Ping had been trying to use Cat Treasure's abilities to mass-replicate this bloodline. Currently, Cat Treasure had three discovered abilities: item replication, creature simulation, and marrow cleansing. Firstly, Li Ping, by any means necessary, had Cat Treasure simulate a member of the Abyssal race. Then, using the recorded creature data, he infused it into an ordinary human through marrow cleansing. Through this indirect method, he then replicated the flesh and blood of this infused human. Perhaps because of Cat Treasure's mediation, it bypassed certain restrictions. These replicated clones actually possessed some abilities of the Abyssal bloodline. Although the efficiency of praying to generate Origin Force essence was only about one-fifth of that of an ordinary Abyssal person, the advantage was that there were no restrictions. With the Sacred Dynasty's current powerful flesh-and-blood manufacturing technology, as long as there were enough resources, they could produce them in almost unlimited quantities. It could be said that the problem of energy shortage for the Sacred Dynasty and the Abyssal Sea had been temporarily resolved. Deep within the Abyssal Sea, the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array continued to operate, accumulating energy. It was believed that within a hundred years, enough power would be accumulated to break free from the Immortal Ruins. And before that, Li Ping's task was to first resolve the issue of "orthodoxy" in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning his thoughts to the present, Li Ping subconsciously looked at his shoulder. Cat Treasure was still lying there. However, it had turned its head away and was not looking at Li Ping. It seemed that replicating the bloodline of the first Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate was also a very difficult task for it. For most of this period, it had been sleeping, and besides that, Cat Treasure had also become somewhat indifferent to Li Ping. Li Ping had a premonition that if their relationship continued to weaken, Cat Treasure might leave at any moment. After all, there were no special master-servant imprints between him and Cat Treasure. It was all based on him tempting it with Origin Force essence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He squeezed out a ball of golden light and placed it on Cat Treasure's head. Li Ping, who had delved deep into the void, began to comprehend the laws of the surrounding Star Sea. As for the calamities lingering in the Star Sea… Cat Treasure's occasionally raised tail guided Li Ping in the safe direction of travel. Coupled with his previous experience of long voyages, there were no dangers along the way. "If the decisive battle were to take place outside the Xuanhuang Realm, the assistance from heaven and earth would inevitably be reduced by more than half." "The key to victory, besides Cat Treasure's various divine abilities, might also involve utilizing the ubiquitous calamities in the Star Sea." Outside the void of the Great Qi small world, the ruins of the One Beginning Sect and the terrifying Annihilation Wind Tribulation were sealed. While sealing, Li Ping was also studying this calamity. Compared to the various calamities in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, the Annihilation Wind Tribulation was a power that purely annihilated everything. Li Ping suspected that even the calamities in the Star Sea would gradually turn to decay under the blow of the Annihilation Wind Tribulation. "Ultimately, the so-called Star Sea calamities are merely the magical means of True Immortals." "Although they are incomprehensible to mortals like us." "Since the Annihilation Wind Tribulation can eliminate them without a trace, then in a sense, this power of calamities can also be turned to our use." "However, finding the appropriate method…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A flash of inspiration struck Li Ping's heart. Ignoring Cat Treasure's warning, he actively flew towards the dangerous area not far away in the void. Origin Force essence shielded him, and protective measures were in place. Li Ping quietly comprehended the mystical changes applied to the surface of the Origin Force essence. Under Cat Treasure's dumbfounded gaze, Li Ping felt the surroundings suddenly become dark again. Unlike the darkness in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea before, due to the lack of light and silence, the current Li Ping, feeling a gradual severance of his connection with the world and moving further away from all things in the Star Sea, felt a bone-chilling darkness. Not only was his connection severed, but even the connection within Li Ping's body to the Xuanhuang Realm, and the line connecting him to other mysterious unknown existences, were slowly fading. The Faceless Saint Emperor, who had always been concerned about the Xuanhuang Realm, suddenly felt a sense of detachment from worldly affairs at this moment. He felt that the Xuanhuang Realm, and all living beings within it, were no longer that important to him. The long-standing concern was about to be completely let go.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A slight tremor from his shoulder, however, instantly pulled Li Ping out of that state. Li Ping then realized that even when facing the calamity of the True Immortal script, and with all connections to the world gradually fading, Cat Treasure, however, remained on his shoulder. There was no sign of separation. With Origin Force essence protecting his body, his figure flashed, and Li Ping instantly escaped the area covered by the calamity. "This True Immortal script seems to be particularly effective on me." "Alone, or is it 'Sole'?" Li Ping gazed at that area and pondered silently. He conjured another ball of golden light and placed it on Cat Treasure's head. This time, Cat Treasure unceremoniously took a bite and then lazily fell back asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun family, underground secret chamber.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's divine sense sensed that the connection with the Saint Emperor's clone had completely disappeared, and he felt some regret. "The last sensation was the power of the True Immortal script?" "Alone?" "Unexpectedly, by chance, using its power, he completely broke free from me." However, after a moment, Li Fan felt relieved. With the Saint Emperor's current cultivation level, controlling him in real-time like a chess piece was unrealistic. Furthermore, he had the mysterious creation, Cat Treasure, to help him… If he still couldn't completely sever ties with Li Fan's true body, then Li Fan would have to doubt whether the Saint Emperor could truly force out the true strength of the Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician. As for the safety of the Saint Emperor clone, or rather, Li Ping, Li Fan did not worry. After all, the Saint Embryo had not perished under the "Alone" technique, and the Saint Emperor Li Ping, with his superior strength and numerous fortuitous encounters, naturally had no reason to be unable to escape. "In any case, the general direction has been set, and we'll just watch his performance." "No matter what, the harvest in this life has been more than enough." "It's even to the point where I'm dazzled."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Li Fan's divine sense was contemplating, a somewhat familiar voice suddenly rang out. "Senior, when can we go out and see? I'm really bored being cooped up here." Li Fan shifted his gaze, his eyes dim. It was the voice of Sun Luoyao, originally. But now, his actions and expressions had reached a point where it was difficult to distinguish between true and false. After Li Fan's continuous attempts, especially thanks to the gains of the Saint Embryo on the Immortal Boat, he had finally created a somewhat qualified simulated personality of Sun Luoyao. This Sun Luoyao himself did not even realize that he was a fictional existence. His consciousness and memories were restored to the time when Li Fan had erased the wind calamity in his body, and Li Fan had promised to take him out to travel and look for other possible immortal artifacts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What's wrong, Senior?" Sun Luoyao's gaze at Li Fan seemed to hold a hint of fear. "Heh heh." Li Fan smiled kindly. "It's nothing, I just thought of something happy. Since you said so, let's go out today." Sun Luoyao was overjoyed. "That's great!" Following the same procedure, after creating the fake Sun Luoyao and the Immeasurable Mirror, Li Fan's divine sense took them, the "main bodies," out of the underground secret chamber. "Senior, where are we going first?" "Within the nearest vicinity, I don't seem to sense any signs of immortal artifacts potentially existing," Sun Luoyao asked after checking around. "Do some preparatory work." Li Fan answered simply. Flying rapidly, they arrived at the entrance of a small world and leaped into the spatial passage. "Eh? This small world is all plants?" Sun Luoyao said with some novelty as he looked at the scene before him. It was like a tropical rainforest, with various towering and dense vegetation vying for sunlight. Occasionally, one could see vines slithering like pythons in the shadows, quietly entangling other towering trees. Soon, the trees withered and fell with a creak, clearing a large area of space above their heads. Within moments, sunlight poured in, and other trees grew visibly, filling the gap. "Senior, this small world seems to still be in a relatively primitive stage of life. We probably won't find the immortal artifact we're looking for," Sun Luoyao said, engrossed in the scene but still dutifully offering his advice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We're not looking for an immortal artifact. I'll teach you a formation. After you learn it, the task of setting up the formation will be yours." Li Fan said calmly. Sun Luoyao's spirits lifted upon hearing this. "Thank you, Senior! I will not disappoint your trust!" "Watch carefully, this formation is called…" "Primordial Void Spirit Formation!" Li Fan flew into the sky above this small world. Rays of light descended, completely obscuring the sunlight from the sky. The primitive jungle small world, which already seemed somewhat dim, now entered true darkness. And in Sun Luoyao's sight, the light Li Fan sprinkled down were streams of extremely profound formation runes. Even with his foundation as an immortal artifact, it was extremely difficult to decipher. As the formation gradually took shape, a sense of familiarity, yet also inexplicable fear, arose in Sun Luoyao's heart. "This is…" Sun Luoyao's face turned pale. After a long while, he finally recalled. That was the feeling of being on the verge of death, the feeling of clinging to a thread of hope, that he experienced every time he faced the Annihilation Wind Tribulation previously! His intuition told him that if he remained here and waited for the formation to be completed, it would be the day of his doom! The Immeasurable Mirror trembled slightly, quickly transforming into a beam of light and flying to Li Fan's side. Li Fan ignored it and continued to perfect the formation. "Unfortunately, partly due to material deficiencies, and partly because it's only a divine sense projection, the full power of the Void Spirit Formation cannot be unleashed." "However, it is sufficient to condense some defensive layers." More than ten days later, the Primordial Void Spirit Formation was completed. With a beam of light that seemed capable of destroying the world, this small world completely disappeared. And Li Fan's divine sense, along with the Immeasurable Mirror, returned to the Xuanhuang Realm. "Did you learn the formation from just now?" The simulated personality of Sun Luoyao did not respond for a long time. It turned out that the structure maintaining the simulated personality of "true nature" had been destroyed by the ripple effect of the Primordial Void Spirit Formation. "What useless trash." Li Fan snorted coldly.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-295" class="calibre1">Chapter 1284: The Great Awakening of Qi Enlightenment (7K)</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But considering this Sun Luoyao before him was actually Li Fan's own creation, scolding him as trash would be equivalent to criticizing his own craftsmanship. Thus, Li Fan swallowed the words of scolding that had reached his lips. With another cold snort, his thoughts raced. The currently ineffective "Sun Luoyao" had been destroyed. A moment later, an entirely new simulated personality was born. "Senior, that formation just now..." the new simulated personality said with a bitter tone, its face pale, clearly unaware that it had just been created. "It was too profound. This junior has not yet learned it." Sun Luoyao spoke with difficulty, fearing he would anger Li Fan. Li Fan, feeling the weight of the crystalline sphere condensed at the cost of an entire small world, revealed a gentle smile. "Don't worry. This Unbounded Spirit Void Formation is indeed a bit complex. I'll demonstrate it a few more times." His calm words sent chills down Sun Luoyao's spine, but he dared not retort, merely staring blankly as his companion continued towards their next target small world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua’s eyes flashed with a hint of gravity as she transformed into a golden light and flew towards the endless void opened by the Rift-Tearing Whale. After all, it couldn't be used to transcend mortal limits and ascend to True Immortalhood. Any more was useless. Before Sun Erlang could speak, Qiao Gong Jushi's voice rang out, "Whether it works or not isn't determined by boasting. Let's settle it with our skills! Young Sun, deal with her properly!" Bai Hua Daoist felt herself slowly growing listless. Sun Erlang's responding voice echoed, but didn't come from these puppets. "Senior misunderstands. These puppets are all manipulated by me alone. So, it's a fair fight..." Before he finished speaking, Sun Erlang’s figure vanished from Bai Hua’s spiritual sense. Sun Erlang admitted frankly, "This junior went back to cultivate for a while this time, and I feel I've improved again, so I've come to seek your guidance!" There were also scenes of being captured by the fishing pond, alongside the survivors of various realms. The one who arrived was the Saint Emperor's eldest disciple, Sun Erlang. The small worlds Li Fan chose were all subordinate to Da Qi, the smallest type, undiscovered by the Myriad Immortals Alliance, specifically to prevent outsiders from noticing them being approached by the Xuanhuang Realm's Immortal Ruins. Sun Erlang clasped his hands, "Senior, please be careful... This time, it's truly different from before." Bai Hua Daoist playfully remarked, "Young Sun knows he can't win, so he's changed a one-on-one fight to a group assault?" "I wonder if all these fellows are truly dead," Bai Hua couldn't help but think.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Da Qi small world. A single glazed golden flower materialized in her hand with a mere thought. Bai Hua smiled, "I told you, don't listen to that Qiao Gong blowing his own horn, talking about puppets comparable to Longevity cultivators. They are ultimately just dead objects. How can they truly compare to us cultivators!" "Gold of Space-Tearing!" While Bai Hua was in a daze, a spatial fluctuation occurred ahead, catching her attention. Emptying her mind, thinking of nothing. Fleeting fragments of images occasionally flashed by. "You've come to get beaten again?" Bai Hua saw Sun Erlang's expression and knew his intention, unable to help but feel a bit helpless. Petals fluttered, yet the glazed flower's main body showed no signs of damage. In a short while, the void around Bai Hua Daoist was shrouded by countless golden flower petals. Bang! Bang! Petals scattered, continuously colliding with the secretly hidden, following puppets. All along, she had completed the Saint Emperor's tasks perfectly. The rewards of Origin Force essence were also consistent, and recently, they had even become more abundant. Li Fan weighed the sphere in his hand. "Two or three more like this, and it would far exceed the protection that my 119th life's [Ascetic Training of All Beings] could provide. There should be no problem." In the void, five almost identical voices sounded simultaneously with Sun Erlang's words. But Origin Force essence, after all, was just that. "It's likely the puppets manipulated by that fellow. However, I can't even lock onto him with my divine sense?" After gaining freedom, the Origin Force essence gradually lost its target and motivation. The most it did daily was care for the various cavern-worlds, ensuring smooth spiritual energy circulation and vibrant life. Golden-bronze colored puppets began to reveal their true forms one by one. Some were from their experiences in the Sacred Dynasty of Da Qi after awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Bai Hua Senior." There were a total of five, who had already quietly surrounded Bai Hua in the center. Bai Hua Daoist finally felt a spark of interest. Secondly, she would just zone out. And then, in an instant, they bloomed with explosive force. However, he estimated that his act of severing the roots of the Xuanhuang Realm's tree wouldn't last long. She vaguely felt a presence secretly following her. She felt as if something was secretly following her. She had never had it before, and now she had it. Previously, she thought it was precious and that she had to try it. Now that she was rich, she felt it was tasteless. Bai Hua Daoist was at the border of the Five Elements Great Cavern-world, staring blankly into the void. Upon sensing that familiar aura, her instantly tensed nerves relaxed. … "Gold of Space-Tearing!" "Wood of Entanglement!" "Water of Life-Extinguishing!" "Earth of Void!" Strange Five Elements powers surged from the five puppets respectively. They didn't immediately attack Bai Hua but formed a formation in an instant. Inside the formation, Bai Hua seemed to have instantly left the void and returned to the Five Elements Great Cavern-world. However, the Five Elements Cavern-world here was not vibrant and full of life; instead, it was filled with a murderous aura. Every trace of Five Elements energy within the cavern-world was like a sharp sword. Upon sensing Bai Hua, an outsider, it launched a frantic assault. Gold of Space-Tearing, silent and traceless, its sharpness could tear space itself. Wood of Entanglement, seeking targets in the void, once entangled, it would not rest until death. Water of Life-Extinguishing, extinguishing all life force. Even Bai Hua's released golden glazed flowers withered rapidly upon contact. … The Five Elements gave birth to each other, and the five types of power transformed into one another, inexhaustible. Bai Hua was trapped in the formation, seemingly having endured several days of siege, yet her offensive showed no signs of weakening. "This is the Five Elements Killing Formation." "The main formation should be those five puppets. Instead of attacking directly, they transformed into the eyes of the formation..." While Bai Hua was contemplating, she didn't notice that a dark golden puppet had silently appeared behind her. Hidden within the violent Five Elements energy, like a golden long sword, it ruthlessly struck down. Ding! A sound like metal striking metal echoed through the Five Elements Killing Formation. Bai Hua Daoist’s body instantly turned transparent. A glazed golden flower bloomed within her. Under the light, the long sword that had pierced into her body gradually also became glazed and transparent. The power of the Gold of Space-Tearing erupted, breaking free from the glazed erosion, and then disappeared again, hiding in the chaotic Five Elements Killing Formation. "Not bad." Bai Hua Daoist showed her true form to Sun Erlang for the first time. She said calmly, "If it were the me of the past, I would have been severely injured by your move." "Unfortunately..." Within Bai Hua Daoist's transparent body, the glazed flower rapidly expanded. Under the pure glazed brilliance, the violent Five Elements energy was completely assimilated into solid glazed crystals. In just a few breaths, the glazed flower had swept over everything, engulfing the entire formation space. Ding! A slender finger extended from the solidified crystal. It lightly tapped the condensed flower. A crack appeared, and then rapidly spread throughout the entire flower body. Bang! The flower exploded into countless fragments. The originally violent Five Elements Killing Formation completely turned into void. Bai Hua also returned to her original form, looking around. But what made her expression change was that this move, the [Pure Life Glazed Light] capable of instantly destroying a small world, did not seem to have destroyed the Five Elements Killing Formation? In the void, a disturbing aura began to emerge again. Bai Hua Daoist identified it and suddenly realized, "It's not the Five Elements Killing Formation, but the Yin-Yang Five Elements Grand Formation." Yin and Yang energies circulated, and Five Elements energies emerged from the chaos, ever-flowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, the calm void became lively again. Bai Hua saw this and couldn't help but frown slightly. She could easily destroy the formation, but she couldn't prevent the process of Yin and Yang giving birth to Five Elements. Even if she killed it again and again, the killing intent targeting her in the void remained undiminished. "The power of Yin-Yang and Five Elements, combined with the formation, has not significantly increased its lethality, but it has indeed become much more troublesome." Although Bai Hua had a basic understanding of formations, she did not sense any traces of a formation in the surroundings. "Hahahaha! Bai Hua, you're out of ideas, aren't you! Just surrender obediently!" Qiao Gong Daoist's arrogant voice echoed through the Killing Formation. Bai Hua snorted coldly, and a brilliant golden light ignited in her eyes. "Sun kid, be careful. We've finally forced out this move! Let's see how our prepared countermeasures measure up." With the enhancement of Origin Force essence, Bai Hua's glazed light seemed to have become even purer. It was as if even space itself had crystallized, and a shimmering gem slowly formed around her. The Yin and Yang energies that nurtured the Five Elements, and even the structure that sustained the formation, had no place to hide under the pressure of such pure power. Light from the outside shone in, and the killing formation was about to be broken by Bai Hua. "Only you have Origin Force essence?!" Just as this moment arrived, Qiao Gong's slightly smug voice rang out again. A finger, composed entirely of golden light, ignored the solidified glazed crystals and appeared inexplicably before Bai Hua's eyes. The crystals shattered with a bang, turning into countless flowing streams of light. The golden finger was unstoppable, pressing down fiercely towards her forehead. Bai Hua's expression changed slightly, and her body returned to its pure glazed form. Under the same golden light, Bai Hua and the golden finger clashed. What surprised her was that this seemingly terrifying golden finger of Origin Force essence was actually an empty shell. It shattered at the touch, turning into innumerable golden threads that wrapped around her body. "Young Sun, cast your net!" Qiao Gong Daoist shouted with extreme excitement. The golden threads spread instantly, crisscrossing, and Bai Hua Daoist, caught off guard, fell into the net! The glazed flower tried to emit light, but it collided with the golden net and was annihilated into nothingness. A powerful force surged from the golden net, dragging Bai Hua towards the front. "Presumptuous!" Bai Hua's cold shout echoed. "All beings are glazed!" In an instant, Bai Hua's seemingly captured figure disappeared. The glazed flower also reappeared, its petals falling one by one, but this time they vanished completely. In an instant, her true form was revealed. Amidst the flickering light and shadow, it was actually a glazed world! Glazed and frozen, countless beings instantly opened their eyes! Hiss... The golden net wrapped around the world instantly showed cracks. Qiao Gong Jushi's shocked and enraged voice rang out, "You weren't supposed to have escaped the world back then, were you?! I didn't expect you to refine the entire Myriad Sheng Realm into a glazed form!" "What a vicious woman!" Within the glazed world, Bai Hua Daoist's voice echoed, "What do you know! This is for survival!" "Not just for me, but for the entire Heavenly Lotus Sect!" With Bai Hua's furious roar, brilliant light erupted from the glazed world, completely shattering the golden net that bound her.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Young Sun, quickly retreat!" "Senior, please forgive me..." She faintly heard Qiao Gong Jushi's somewhat flustered voice and Sun Erlang's helpless voice. Returning to the void, their figures were already nowhere to be seen. The glazed flower bloomed again, obscuring the central Myriad Sheng Realm. Bai Hua Daoist resumed her original form. She didn't pursue them but returned to the Five Elements Great Cavern-world. "I just had a fight, and it's finally not so boring. I wonder when we can truly go to war with the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" "If we can truly escape the Immortal Ruins, or even the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea, perhaps the Heavenly Lotus Sect can also see the light of day again." Bai Hua Daoist's thoughts churned. She had a special kind of confidence in the Saint Emperor. Bai Hua inadvertently glanced towards the outside void. Where the Saint Emperor had gone before, she faintly sensed an energy that made the entire Myriad Sheng Realm tremble with fear. "Truly a madman..." Within the Sacred Dynasty of Da Qi, Qiao Gong, looking somewhat disheveled, cursed to himself while looking heartbrokenly at the seven dark golden puppets before him. "I should have known. Those who survived the world-ending calamity couldn't possibly be simple. Seeing her docile appearance before the Saint Emperor, I was actually fooled..." "Qiao Gong, Qiao Gong, you're truly muddled!" Sun Erlang remained silent. The strength displayed by this seemingly amiable Bai Hua Senior exploding suddenly was indeed somewhat terrifying. However, the purpose of finding her for a spar this time had been achieved. Sun Erlang looked at the seven dark golden puppets in the arena. By manipulating these puppets, he not only became more familiar with the power of the seven Heavenly Souls within the puppet cores but also vaguely deepened his understanding of controlling Origin Force essence. "No! I refuse to believe that I, Qiao Gong of the Heavenly Mystery Realm, can be outdone by a mere Myriad Sheng Realm!" His voice filled with resentment, Qiao Gong took out an object from his embrace. "Young Sun, install this onto these puppets!" Qiao Gong said fiercely. "What is this?" Sun Erlang looked at the square black object in Qiao Gong's hand, asking curiously. "Hehehe, this is the [Experience] extracted from the Immortal Puppet [Ancestor] of our Heavenly Mystery Realm. It cannot be replicated. After the Heavenly Mystery Realm was destroyed, each use diminishes it. I was reluctant to use it before, but now..." Qiao Gong glanced at it reluctantly, then gritted his teeth. "I absolutely cannot let that woman surpass me!" Hearing the words "Immortal Puppet," Sun Erlang's heart trembled. Just as he was about to take it, he suddenly remembered something and hesitated, "This precious item, why don't you give it to Senior Tianyang? Perhaps it would be more useful to him..." Qiao Gong waved his hand, "I already gave him a portion. Do you know where he's been all this time? He's been in seclusion meditating, and he hasn't emerged yet!" "Stop babbling, just do as I say! Quickly, I might regret it later!" Sun Erlang no longer demurred. Connecting his mind to the seven dark golden puppets, he simultaneously crushed the square black object in his hand. Black liquid flowed from the gaps in his hand. Like a living creature, it climbed up Sun Erlang's arm, reaching his head. It coiled high like a hunting cobra and then fiercely burrowed into Sun Erlang's eye sockets. Out of trust for Qiao Gong, Sun Erlang did not resist. The moment the black liquid obscured his vision, Sun Erlang's perception of his surroundings changed. A torrent of blurry images flooded his mind, accompanied by fragmented combat memories. Or more accurately, memories of "being beaten." Mysterious and unfathomable techniques struck the Immortal Puppets. The Immortal Puppets could only endure the blows with their tough material, with little opportunity for counterattack. But even from simply being beaten, profound insights emerged in Sun Erlang's mind. Having been beaten so many times, Sun Erlang seemed to have developed a kind of instinct. When the attack of the Immortal Technique reappeared in his mind, he instinctively felt how to counter it. This feeling captivated Sun Erlang. It was a pity that just as he seemed on the verge of truly sensing something, the images suddenly disappeared. The previous insights also receded like a tide, leaving no trace. "Ugh..." Sun Erlang's veins bulged on his forehead, his fists clenched, and he gasped for air. His eyes turned red, staring intently at Qiao Gong Jushi. Qiao Gong, however, seemed to have expected this and had already moved far away. He said coldly, "Young Sun, clear your head. Don't be deceived by illusions!" "Those feelings of nearing enlightenment, are they from yourself, or from the Immortal Puppet?!" Qiao Gong's words were like a basin of ice water poured over him. Sun Erlang gradually sobered up. However, it still took him nearly half a day to suppress the thought of wanting to snatch the Immortal Puppet's experience from Qiao Gong and continue meditating.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'm sorry, Senior," Sun Erlang said with some shame. "It's alright. You don't need to blame yourself. Let alone you, even those old fellows in our Heavenly Mystery Realm can't resist this temptation," Qiao Gong licked his lips, seemingly savoring the taste of enlightenment. "Now, look again. What's different from before?" Qiao Gong instructed. Sun Erlang refocused on the five dark golden puppets. After a moment, a hint of joy flashed in his eyes. "Huh? Those memories of being beaten are constantly reappearing..." Sun Erlang closed his eyes and felt. Qiao Gong clapped his hands, and thousands of Sacred Army puppets appeared one after another. With their mechanical instincts, they simultaneously launched an attack on the dark golden puppets manipulated by Sun Erlang. As if tempered through a thousand trials, Sun Erlang easily dodved all the techniques. This result stunned even Sun Erlang. He couldn't even understand why those attacks, which clearly landed on the dark golden puppets he controlled, ultimately caused no damage. It wasn't that the powerful defense of the dark golden puppets had nullified the damage. It was that, through some extremely mysterious method, all the attacks from the Sacred Army puppets had been dodged. "Don't hesitate, maintain this instinctive feeling as much as possible!" "The remnants of the Immortal Puppet's experience will dissipate soon. How much you can retain in the end depends on your own destiny!" Qiao Gong's words brought Sun Erlang back to his senses. He cast aside all other thoughts, focused his mind, and memorized the Immortal Puppet's evasion instinct. However, it was, after all, the divine ability of an Immortal Puppet, not something that could be solidified by mortal means. Even though Sun Erlang tried his best, as time passed, the puppets he controlled were inevitably hit more and more times. After seven days of persistence, the evasion rate finally stabilized at a certain value. "One-third." "That's a decent result," Qiao Gong comforted him. Sun Erlang was clearly somewhat dissatisfied. "Don't worry. As you continue to meditate in the future, your evasion ability will still improve to a certain extent. However, to reach the level of an Immortal Puppet, moving freely and dodging attacks from so-called divine abilities at will..." "Perhaps only by breaking through the mortal limit." Qiao Gong Jushi said truthfully. Sun Erlang took a deep breath, pushing down the regret in his heart. "Don't underestimate this one-third. In life-and-death combat, it often has miraculous effects. Even if someone's strength far surpasses yours, their attacks might be inadvertently dodged by you." "More importantly, you can control seven puppets simultaneously. In actual combat, due to the shared senses of the seven puppet bodies, the performance will actually be slightly higher than this numerical value..." Qiao Gong began to summarize and analyze the gains with Sun Erlang. "If you were to fight Bai Hua again now, you would have a high probability of dodging her glazed golden light from the Myriad Sheng Realm. If the formation isn't broken, she would be nothing more than a turtle in a jar..." Qiao Gong clearly still harbored some resentment towards Bai Hua, muttering sullenly. While they were talking, they suddenly felt the surrounding space subtly vibrate. "Hm?" Sun Erlang and Qiao Gong were first stunned, then they both flew out of the test site. Not only their location, but the entire Sacred Dynasty of Da Qi was engulfed in violent tremors. In the sky, a vortex vaguely appeared. Thunderbolts rumbled within it. "This is..." A hint of surprise flashed in Sun Erlang's eyes. He had experienced a similar scene before. It was the anomaly that occurred when the Sacred Dynasty's environment underwent an overall sublimation. After the previous anomaly, the Sacred Dynasty's spiritual energy concentration had increased manifold. And the number of talented individuals appearing in the world had also significantly increased compared to before. The current cultivation environment of the Sacred Dynasty was no less than that of the ordinary regions of the Xuanhuang Realm. If it were to sublimate again... Wouldn't it far surpass the Xuanhuang Realm? Not only Li Ping's disciples but also the citizens of the Sacred Dynasty had all emerged from their homes, looking up at the sky with excitement. As the direct beneficiaries of the world's sublimation, without any summons, the citizens of the Sacred Dynasty all knelt down in unison, sincerely praying to the Saint Emperor. If Li Ping were here, he would see that the Sacred Dynasty's luck, which had already condensed to its absolute limit, was showing signs of breaking through again. However, taking this step was extremely difficult. Amidst the prayers of the Sacred Dynasty citizens, tangible violet energy floated out from all directions and was absorbed by the vortex in the sky. The sounds of wind and thunder intensified, and the thunderbolts even made Sun Erlang's heart tremble. From above his head, he felt increasing pressure. "Master has broken through again." A flash of understanding surged into Sun Erlang's heart. From the expressions of Su Yuqing, Ou Shangtian, and the other disciples of the Saint Emperor, Sun Erlang saw that they shared the same thought as himself. The vortex in the sky spun faster and faster, and starlight occasionally shot out from it, sprinkling down on various corners of the world. As vegetation was touched, it grew visibly. As living beings were touched, it was as if they had received a divine awakening, instantly achieving enlightenment. Moreover, several condensed streams of vast starlight shot out like ribbons, accurately flying towards Sun Erlang and others. This included Bai Hua, Qiao Gong, and Yin Shangren, who had been summoned by the Saint Emperor. The moment the starlight entered their bodies, Sun Erlang's vision drastically changed. It was as if he had truly arrived in the endless void outside the Xuanhuang Realm. Sun Erlang saw countless terrifying calamities of destruction hidden within the dead silence of the void. Sun Erlang also saw that even in this terrifying destructive Star Sea, countless Dao of the Star Sea were stubbornly reviving. "Light is hidden beneath darkness..." "Life is born from death." Like a devout follower experiencing enlightenment, Sun Erlang witnessed the vastness and resilience of the Star Sea, tears streaming down his face. And the other cultivators within the Sacred Dynasty also experienced the same. Waves of profound energy surged from their bodies, reaching towards the heavens. The shared enlightenment caused the tremors of the Da Qi small world to intensify. This fluctuation even spread beyond the world, extending towards the void. The Five Elements Cavern-worlds around Da Qi, and other small worlds that had been relocated here, also resonated in unison. Like the rhythm of a heartbeat, something seemed to be gestated within this heartbeat. All living beings in the Da Qi small world looked up at the vortex in the sky as if they felt something. Amidst the gazes of the multitude, a majestic figure descended slowly into the world, passing through the wind, thunder, violet energy, and mysterious starlight. "We welcome the Saint Emperor!" Billions of Da Qi citizens bowed in unison, shouting their greetings. And the Saint Emperor's disciples, as well as Bai Hua, Qiao Gong, and Yin Shangren, were somewhat shocked to discover that their familiar Faceless Saint Emperor's originally empty face now had features! After a moment of hesitation, the aura emanating from the Saint Emperor undoubtedly confirmed his true identity. The Saint Emperor stood high above the nine heavens, looking down at the beings below. With a gentle wave of his hand, all the kneeling citizens stood up.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-296" class="calibre1">Chapter 1285: Fifty Years Old to Pass on the Law</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The vortex in the sky was about to close. The Saint Emperor reached out and grasped the last beam of starlight shooting out from it. The nebulae swirled, shining brilliantly. After being refined in the Saint Emperor's palm, it flowed like gentle water towards him. It transformed into a star-lit throne. The Saint Emperor sat upright and spoke slowly, his voice like thunder: " Boundless Primordial Chaos, Infinite Innate; Yin and Yang separate, Five Elements flow; All things emerge, created by the Great One..." Every word was profoundly mysterious and difficult to understand. But under the Saint Emperor's recitation, the living beings fortunate enough to hear it in this world faintly felt a sense of contemplation. The fleeting moment of enlightenment, just experienced under the starlight from above, became clear again under the Saint Emperor's every word of the Great Dao's resonant sound. "Dao follows Heaven and Earth, holding it in hand is to be Immortal; Freely roaming the Azure Void, commanding Creation; Eternal through ten thousand tribulations, energy nurturing the eight desolate lands..." Even those with mediocre aptitude and low cultivation, under the Saint Emperor's voice, gained some understanding. The anger in their hearts only intensified. The enlightened populace listened as if drunk. Yin Shangren scratched his scalp. He felt as if the primal Dao foundation within his body was impatient to burst forth. "This is Master's good fortune, and also your good fortune." However, at this juncture, no one dared question the Great Saint Emperor's decision. The Myriad Immortals Alliance controlled half of the Xuanhuang Realm's territories, yet it could still be commanded as if an extension of their arm. This was precisely because of the Heaven-Probing Mirrors and the Law Transmission Altars spread across every state. And seizing the opportunity when everyone was distracted, they hastily left the cave dwelling. "During the three years of preparation, some methods can be implemented in advance." The remaining disciples all nodded in agreement. Six disciples, lined up in order. Sun Luoyuan was speaking eloquently at a gathering when he suddenly sensed something and quickly interrupted his lengthy speech. "Is this what they call 'one person ascending, the chickens and dogs ascend'? No, this is clearly sharing one's own understanding selflessly, imparting it to others regardless of closeness. Hiss..." "The 'Dark Needle Plan' is finally going to be implemented? I've waited so long for this day." A glint flashed in Sun Luoyuan's eyes. He suppressed the excitement and a hint of fear for the future, concealed his aura, and hurried towards the agreed meeting point. As for those with exceptional aptitude like Sun Erlang and Ou Shangtian, their eyes shone brightly, and purple energy even began to swirl around them. "Master gives you three years to comprehend. Three years from today..." The Saint Emperor's voice echoed in everyone's minds. Most of them would need the rest of their lives to digest the Saint Emperor's sermon. Xuanhuang Realm, Tianquan Prefecture. No matter which prefecture encountered a problem, support from all prefectures or even the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance could swiftly arrive. "Congratulations, Master, on your enlightenment!" Sun Erlang said with a bow. Therefore, to deal with the Myriad Immortals Alliance, destroying or interfering with this connection became the top priority. Everyone lowered their heads and complied. The so-called Dark Needle Plan was a sabotage plan targeting the Myriad Immortals Alliance's Heaven-Probing Mirrors and their teleportation altars. The Saint Emperor's gaze swept over the six disciples below: "Our Great Qi Sacred Dynasty will conquer the Myriad Immortals Alliance and reclaim the Xuanhuang Realm!" "Three years." ... The Saint Emperor's sermon lasted for three days and three nights. The six disciples' bodies trembled upon hearing this. But Sun Luoyuan had already made up his mind. Besides the reasons that led him to betray them before, a greater factor was the recent demise of Sun Luochang. Even if it was just a perfunctory comfort, it would suffice. They had long known that this battle was inevitable, but no one had expected it to come so soon! It was only when the Saint Emperor's image dissipated that they remained immersed in it, completely oblivious. Sun Luoyuan had been waiting for the Myriad Immortals Alliance to give him an explanation. It was only when the essence of blood left in the underground blood pool suddenly dried up that Sun Luoyuan felt despair. "Before, Ou Shangtian said he could influence or even destroy the Heaven-Probing Mirrors in each prefecture. I don't know how he did it. However, my informants in each prefecture are already prepared," Sun Luoyuan pondered as he hurried along. Spiritual energy spontaneously flowed into his body, an image of achieving enlightenment on the spot. He knew that once the arrow was shot, there was no turning back. If he made a move this time, he would completely solidify his identity as a traitor to the Myriad Immortals Alliance. If discovered, there would be no chance of survival. These days, he had watched the Myriad Immortals Alliance continue to release rainbow light messages from beyond the realm, even showing images of Sun Luochang, who had already perished. And now, the Saint Emperor had returned to his throne to contemplate. When he was chosen to go beyond the Xuanhuang Realm, Sun Luoyuan still held a sliver of hope for Sun Luochang's survival. But clearly, he had overthought. The various prefecture guardians at the Harmonious Dao stage and those so-called important officials of the Myriad Immortals Alliance were indeed like materials that could be discarded at will. They were abandoned without hesitation. "Myriad Immortals Alliance..." At this point, Sun Luoyuan had completely severed all hope he had for the Myriad Immortals Alliance. He had completely sided with the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty. "Regardless of anything else, the benefits I have received from the Sacred Dynasty in recent years far outweigh those from serving the Myriad Immortals Alliance." Thinking this, Sun Luoyuan had already arrived at the agreed rendezvous point. Beside the towering white mist barrier in Tianquan Prefecture. Years ago, due to the great upheaval in the Xuanhuang Realm, the white mist barrier here had broken and crashed to the ground. The unconstrained Devouring Mist had flowed and spread outwards, mercilessly devouring all the living beings it enveloped. Although the great upheaval eventually subsided and the white mist barrier was restored, this dead land had never recovered its vitality. This attested to the terrifying nature of the Devouring Mist. "Who would have thought that the Sacred Dynasty actually had a way to almost completely negate the influence of this Devouring Mist. Meeting here is the safest!" Sun Luoyuan scanned his surroundings, ensuring no one was following, and cautiously took out the [Dilligent True Boat]. Flying into the boat, he piloted it into the white mist barrier. Maintaining a constant speed and constantly changing direction, after traveling for a while, he indeed saw another Diligent True Boat quietly docked within the white mist. A black light flew out from it, lightly cutting through the white mist and arriving in front of Sun Luoyuan. Sun Luoyuan took it and found it was a storage ring made of black jade. When he looked up again, the previous Diligent True Boat had already vanished without a trace. "So cautious, they wouldn't even show their face." Inside the black jade ring, nearly a thousand square jade pieces, engraved with profound characters, were neatly arranged. Sun Luoyuan took one out and examined it carefully, while also reading the usage instructions just transmitted via the black light. "As long as it is brought into a Heaven-Probing Mirror or a teleportation altar, and activated, it can explode?" "So simple?" Sun Luoyuan was somewhat surprised. He immediately felt the urge to try it out. However, after studying it carefully, he could only shake his head in frustration. "The detonation time has already been set. It can only be detonated three years later. Before that time, even the core formation within is not activated, and it is just an ordinary jade piece..." "No wonder I couldn't sense any spiritual fluctuations from it." Sun Luoyuan put the jade piece back, his expression grim: "Let those cultivators, whom the Myriad Immortals Alliance considers ants, be the first to sound the death knell for it." Just as the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty began to operate for the conquest plan three years later, Li Fan had already annihilated four small worlds through the Spirit Void Grand Array. He had collected enough of the substance he called [Essence of All Things]. A pure collection of energy, emitting a dreamlike, multicolored viscous glow. To Li Fan, it felt similar to the golden Origin Force Essence. "Have you learned this formation?" Li Fan gazed into the distance, asking the Boundless Mirror. The simulated personality, Sun Luoyao, who had been rebuilt several times, remained silent for a moment before finally replying, "I've more or less learned it, Senior." Li Fan nodded with satisfaction. He gently flicked his finger, and a beam of light entered Sun Luoyao's illusory form: "Then, for the next step, you will go to these places and continue setting up the formations." "Just quietly set up the formations, no need to activate them." Saying this, Li Fan flicked the Boundless Mirror, along with all the Origin Force Essence he had collected upon returning to the Sun family, towards it. Sun Luoyao quickly collected the golden light, thanked Li Fan excitedly, and then transformed into a beam of light, heading towards the target small world. If it were the real Sun Luoyao, executing Li Fan's task alone might have led to insubordination. But now, he was merely a simulated personality. He might not even be genuinely happy to receive Origin Force Essence; it was all fabricated, so he naturally would not disobey Li Fan's orders. "The Boundless Mirror Spirit setting up formations is less effective than me, but destroying a world is more than enough. After all, the small worlds I chose were all weak, with no cultivators, preventing outsiders from noticing them being approached by the Xuanhuang Realm's Immortal Ruins." "Although he may not show himself again in this life, leaving some contingency is still necessary." The connection with the Saint Emperor had been completely severed. However, Li Fan could still faintly sense the tremendous changes happening to the Saint Emperor. "Did he have another epiphany in the Star Sea?" "Clearly, the clone's original talent was just ordinary. With so many fortuitous encounters and blessings, he has truly begun to resemble a destined protagonist..." A hint of sarcasm flashed across Li Fan's face. "It's a pity, it's all in vain!" Li Fan's divine sense transformed into a thin thread and flew towards the Tianquan Prefecture region. He needed to deliver the [Essence of All Things] he had collected for protection to his main body. In just over half a day, Li Fan had found his target. The "Hermit Chi," who had been cultivating in the mortal world in disguise. The clone, unnoticed, drifted into the body of a nearby Golden Core cultivator. The cultivator paused for a moment, then quickly returned to normal. Turning around, he arrived in front of Hermit Chi. "Elder, shall we play a game of chess?" The disheveled Taoist, who was picking his feet without any decorum, immediately looked up. ... After Li Fan successfully obtained the Law Transmitting Jade Token from Hermit Chi, he first went to the Debating Dao Tower in Tianquan Prefecture and used all his savings to rent a small courtyard. Then, using the [Dao Pill] method, he completely possessed the body of the host cultivator. Li Fan extended his hand, looking at his new body, and frowned slightly. "Compared to the environment of the Xuanxianzhou outside the Star Sea, this soul-possessing method is not as perfect in the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Fan moved his limbs and felt a slight discordance. "Possessing Zhao Xian could deceive the Immortal Severing Tower." "But possessing this..." "Fu Yuansheng, might not be able to evade the inspection of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. I need to refine it further." Li Fan manipulated Fu Yuansheng's body and set up a formation around himself. Then, he strode into the formation. "Using the body as the tool, refining with the formation~" Li Fan chanted softly, using the power of the formation to gradually refine and eliminate the disharmony within the possessed body. During this process, the experiences of the Saint Emperor's cultivation in this life, the sights of the Saint Embryo within the Xuanxianzhou, and the insights gained from the main body's seclusion and enlightenment, all flooded his mind and were integrated by Li Fan. He tapped his fingers, modifying and improving the formation he had just set up. The abnormalities of the body and soul gradually disappeared. "From today onwards, I am Fu Yuansheng!" Li Fan's divine sense smiled slightly. To verify, Li Fan first entered the Heaven-Probing Mirror of Tianquan Prefecture. As expected, he successfully deceived the Heaven-Probing Mirror's inspection and entered his Heaven-Probing Mirror space as Fu Yuansheng. "Two thousand contribution points..." "Truly meager." Li Fan shook his head and sighed, but made no changes. He merely rested for a while as usual before leaving the Heaven-Probing Mirror. He then walked to the most prosperous area of Tianquan Celestial City and activated the Law Transmitting Jade Token. The sudden burst of light immediately attracted the attention of everyone present. "What is that?" "This type of jade token... Hiss, could it be that?" Soon, someone recognized the item in Li Fan's hand, and exclamations of shock and disbelief arose. The surrounding cultivators surrounded Li Fan, who put on an appearance of extreme pallor and forced support. As the recruiting cultivator arrived, stabilizing the chaotic scene, the recruiting cultivator weighed the jade token in his hand and did not directly take Li Fan to the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters. Instead, he transmitted a voice: "This Law Transmitting Jade Token is of exceptional quality, capable of deriving Harmonious Dao cultivation techniques... You are only at the Golden Core stage, which is a waste. Are you interested in transferring this jade token to me? Of course, I will not mistreat you. I will still grant you a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique, and even prepare all the resources needed for your promotion from Nascent Soul to Harmonious Dao." "Thank you for your kind intentions, Senior..." Li Fan cupped his fists, "But I am not interested in transferring the jade token." The recruiting cultivator, who thought Li Fan would agree, changed his expression upon hearing the reply: "Boy, you should think clearly! It's not that having a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique guarantees you can reach Harmonious Dao. I've already investigated your background. Without family support, I doubt you can even reach Nascent Soul on your own!" "I am doing this for your own good!" The recruiting cultivator stared intently at Li Fan. Li Fan was slightly surprised: "Did Senior not hear clearly? Then I will say it again." "Junior is not interested in transferring the Law Transmitting Jade Token." This time, it was not a voice transmission but a clear declaration in public. The surrounding cultivators immediately turned their attention to the recruiting cultivator. Although no one dared to openly discuss, their gazes clearly conveyed their thoughts. The recruiting cultivator, having a deep understanding of worldly affairs, showed no change in his expression: "Since that is the case, so be it. I was merely offering friendly advice. With a Golden Core cultivator possessing a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique... I don't know how many malicious individuals would be tempted to take risks." "Isn't that right, Fu Yuansheng!" he said loudly, also vocally. The voice shook, faintly spreading throughout Tianquan Celestial City. Instantly, all eyes in the city converged on Li Fan. Their expressions varied, but all concealed greed. Li Fan's face turned completely pale, a hint of hatred and fear flashed in his eyes, and he lowered his head, saying, "Thank you for your concern, Senior." The recruiting cultivator let out a cold snort and then opened the passage to the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters. After the two of them left, the previously suppressed Tianquan Celestial City erupted into a frenzy. Golden Core cultivators, Harmonious Dao cultivation techniques. The combination of these two was too impactful, instantly becoming the focus of everyone's discussion. Fu Yuansheng's background information was also quickly dug up. Those with quick minds began to instruct people to pressure the Fu family. Powerless and with low cultivation, even if he obtained a treasure, how could he protect it? In the Debating Dao Tower of Tianquan Celestial City. A cultivator in white robes looked at this scene and sighed slightly: "This recruiting cultivator is truly pushing people to a dead end!" A handsome young man opposite him also nodded in agreement: "Unless Fu Yuansheng can hide in the Heaven-Probing Mirror forever and disregard the lives and deaths of his family and friends, I'm afraid he cannot protect that Harmonious Dao cultivation technique." The young man paused, then changed the subject: "It's just a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique, yet they resort to such life-or-death tactics. And this is happening in broad daylight, in the eyes of everyone... We came out for a cup of tea and encountered such a thing. It just goes to show how many similar incidents are happening offstage." "The Immortal Alliance is corrupt, as can be seen." The white-robed cultivator remained silent, sighing helplessly after a long while. "That's why I say, joining our Sacred Dynasty and overthrowing the corrupt rule of the Immortal Alliance is the wise choice. Tianming, you've been to our Sacred Dynasty before, and such forceful coercion would never happen in the Sacred Dynasty." The young man transmitted his voice, speaking eloquently. The white-robed cultivator, named Tianming, also nodded in agreement: "Brother Tianci, you are right. In that fishing pond, countless treasures were fished out, and they all belonged to the citizens of Da Qi personally. There's no need to worry about others snatching them... Judging by this alone, the Sacred Dynasty is already far superior to the Immortal Alliance!" Shang Tianci smiled: "I see that Brother Tianming has made up his mind." The white-robed cultivator also responded with a smile. "Another one successfully persuaded. This time is truly a blessing from heaven." Shang Tianci secretly thought, and at the same time, the next name flashed in his mind. "I wonder about the progress of the others." In the absence of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's awareness, such changes were constantly occurring everywhere. When people's hearts are lost, it is only a matter of time before they are persuaded or swayed. At the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. When Fu Yuansheng's body, Li Fan, arrived at the headquarters again. As expected, just like the previous few times, Li Fan fell into an illusion. The illusion master was still the Law Transmitting Heavenly Venerate. However, the scenes witnessed this time were completely different from before. Below the continuous immortal mountains shrouded in clouds and mist, a man in his fifties was being ruthlessly stopped. "This is an immortal sacred place, how can you, a mere mortal, trespass?" "Strange, wasn't the outer perimeter protected by an illusion array? How did this mortal get in?" A cultivator in blue Taoist robes muttered, kicking the middle-aged man away. The middle-aged man tumbled awkwardly on the ground, then miraculously got up as if unharmed, saying with a smile, "Immortal Master, can you give me a chance? I feel... I feel like I can cultivate." The cultivator sneered, "You're already half dead, and you still dream of cultivating? Cultivation requires talent and resources. Someone like you..." The cultivator's face was filled with contempt: "Even if you could cultivate, our Tianyuan Sect doesn't accept you!" The middle-aged man didn't give up, even extending his arm, offering it: "Immortal Master, believe me, look, my aptitude..." The cultivator's eyes flashed with killing intent, his spiritual energy surging, about to blast this ignorant fool to death. Just then, a familiar voice echoed from above: "What's your name?" "Xuanyuan Dog Egg... No, Xuanyuan Tuo, my name is Xuanyuan Tuo," the middle-aged Law Transmitter said somewhat nervously. "Uncle Xu!" The cultivator's expression changed, and he immediately withdrew the killing intent in his heart, hurriedly bowing to the newcomer. He was also a middle-aged man, but Uncle Xu looked much more energetic than Xuanyuan Tuo. He came to Xuanyuan Tuo's side and examined him closely. After a moment, Uncle Xu shook his head with a hint of regret: "Although you have sufficient meditative potential, your age is simply too great. It's difficult to achieve anything." "It will be extremely difficult to even reach the Foundation Establishment stage..." Xuanyuan Tuo quickly said, "Immortal Master, I don't ask for much. As long as I can cultivate. I've farmed for half my life, and my mind has always been restless, feeling that I shouldn't spend my life in the fields..." Uncle Xu was somewhat surprised, not expecting this old farmer to say such a thing. Just as he was hesitating, a clear bell chime suddenly sounded from the mountain peak in the distance. The blue-robed cultivator behind him also spoke up, "Uncle Master, the Sect Master is convening a meeting." Uncle Xu glanced back at the mountain peak, swallowed the words he was about to say, and took out a book. "Go back first and read this scripture. If you can cultivate spiritual energy within a year, you can come find me again." Uncle Xu said, then floated away. Xuanyuan Tuo's eyes widened, watching him go. After walking for a while, he seemed to remember something, his face changed drastically, and he wanted to look back, only to find that the magnificent immortal mountain had disappeared at some point. Xuanyuan Tuo slapped his thigh in regret: "I can't read!" ... Boom! The illusion shattered violently, and Li Fan returned to reality. Recalling the content he had just seen, his expression was strange. "What did you see?" The recruiting cultivator asked. Li Fan answered, feigning shock: "I saw the Heavenly Venerate exhibiting the Dharma Body Manifestation, preaching in the world..." "Hmph. A trace of the Heavenly Venerate's aura remains in the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters, so any cultivator entering here for the first time will experience an illusion..." The recruiting cultivator snorted, then explained, "I'll take you to the Law Enforcement Hall headquarters." Along the way, Li Fan secretly pondered. "I wonder what the origin of this illusion is?" "This Law Transmission is quite peculiar, having such a preference for displaying his life story here for his disciples and grandchildren to watch..." "Heh heh, I didn't expect that the dignified Law Transmitting Heavenly Venerate also had such a disreputable side." Li Fan found it difficult to connect the dark-skinned old farmer with the white-haired, long-bearded, sorrowful old man. "If the Tianyuan Sect had accepted the Law Transmitter back then, perhaps the history of the Xuanhuang Realm would have taken a different turn?" "But perhaps not." "After the Law Transmitter awakened, he was not someone a small sect like this could control. Speaking of which, the Tianyuan Sect, after the great catastrophe descended, could barely last long before perishing due to internal strife." "As for Uncle Xu, he looked somewhat similar to the Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, Xu Yuanxian. He might be his ancestor?" Countless thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant. By the time they reached the bluestone path outside the Law Enforcement Hall, Li Fan had reined in his thoughts. Following the same procedure as using the Law Transmitting Jade Token before, after queuing for several days, he finally entered the Law Derivation Chamber. Looking at the "listless" Law Derivation Chamber, Li Fan feigned great excitement. "Why again?" the Law Derivation Chamber muttered, its annoyed expression clearly not feigned. After all, normal technique derivation could be handed over to simulated personalities. But this type of technique derivation tailored specifically for Law Transmitting Jade Tokens required her to act personally. "What are your requirements?" The Law Derivation Chamber threw a piece of paper over. Just as it was about to reach Li Fan, it was caught by "Sun Ang" who was guarding there. "Wait!" Sun Ang's action attracted the attention of the other two guards. "Brother Sun, is something wrong?" Hua Yueye asked with a grave expression. Sun Ang shook his head: "Just a faint feeling of unease. It's better to inspect it more carefully." Since it was for the safety of the Law Derivation Chamber, the other two guards exchanged glances and did not stop him. Fu Yuansheng seemed somewhat nervous at Sun Ang's arrival. "Greetings, Senior..." Sun Ang completely ignored him, placing his right hand on Fu Yuansheng's head. Fu Yuansheng's body instantly froze. After a moment, Sun Ang withdrew his right hand. However, his furrowed brow did not relax. "Two of you, please check again." Hua Yueye and Zhang Xu nodded and each stepped forward to inspect carefully. Naturally, they found nothing. "Perhaps Brother Sun is being overly cautious?" Hua Yueye said. Sun Ang seemed unconvinced, but since the inspection yielded no results, he had no reason to obstruct further. However, throughout the entire derivation process, he kept a close eye on Fu Yuansheng. After the technique derivation was completed, Fu Yuansheng's face was ashen, and he fled as if escaping. "Could it be because I've been here too long?" Without outsiders present, Hua Yueye asked with some concern, "Did you feel unwell?" Sun Ang, also known as Li Fan's main body, sensed the [Essence of All Things] he had obtained. He excused himself, "No. My mind was uneasy..." "Perhaps something happened to my family's bloodline."</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhang Xu stroked his beard, his expression solemn, and said, "The connection between bloodlines is mysterious, yet it must be believed. Brother Sun, perhaps you could send someone to confirm with your family."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hua Yueye echoed the sentiment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thank you for your guidance, fellow Daoists," Sun Ang, which was Li Fan's true body, said after pondering for a moment. He then sent out a spiritual talisman, which flew beyond the Derivation Law Jade space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This spiritual talisman could only be used once every hundred years by each guardian who had reached the Harmonious Dao stage. If it weren’t for the previous "assistance" from Xu Yuan, which reduced Sun Ang's guarding time by a hundred years, he wouldn’t have been able to contact the outside world even now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After about half a day, Sun Luoyuan, the head of the Sun family, personally arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your uncle has unfortunately passed away."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's expression first turned to shock, then morphed into self-reproach and grief: "When Uncle left back then, I already had a vague premonition…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luoyuan comforted him, "Life and death are unpredictable. Lu Chang's demise has nothing to do with you; you don't need to blame yourself, Lu'er."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After flying aimlessly for a long time, Li Fan soon encountered the person he was waiting for.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, it's just a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique, not worth fighting to the death over. Why don't we discuss it peacefully?" someone suggested, directly disregarding the opinion of Fu Yuansheng, the owner of the cultivation technique, treating it as if it were already theirs.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone's focus was on Fu Yuansheng, who seemed to be forced into a corner, desperately trying to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was waiting for an opportunity to completely ignite the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled slightly, then his expression instantly turned pained and filled with immense grief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If necessary, I will find a way to get you out."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You scoundrel, the family head summoned you but you didn't return. What exactly do you want to do?" As soon as Fu Linmu appeared, he unleashed a torrent of scolding at Fu Yuansheng.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan continued his act, his expression becoming increasingly subtle as the urgent message from outside showed no signs of stopping and even grew more intense due to the prolonged lack of a reply.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After Fu Linmu's persuasion, Li Fan appeared to struggle internally before finally seeming to compromise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just then, another unwelcome guest arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let me... give it another push!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't that there were truly so many people coveting the cultivation technique; most of them were simply there to join the excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fu Yuansheng, don't think you'll be lucky forever! You're just a mere Golden Core cultivator, how can you protect a true Harmonious Dao technique? Rather than it being forcibly taken later, why not hand it over proactively and exchange it for a bright future!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pretended to be terrified, but he was nonchalantly leading these people on.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, Fu Yuansheng's appearance drew the attention of some individuals.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, if the price is too high, it's better to just buy it honestly from the Heaven-Probing Mirror."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pretended to be somewhat confused, unsure of who to listen to.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As the saying goes, different places nurture different people. Such things would never happen within our Sacred Dynasty. The Myriad Immortals Alliance is at the end of its rope!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the Sun family's father and son were performing a deeply heartfelt scene, Li Fan, through the possessed Fu Yuansheng, faced immense malice from different individuals within the family.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Knowing that the Sun family had already defected to the Sacred Dynasty of Da Qi, Li Fan naturally understood the true meaning of Sun Luoyuan's words, but at this moment, he could only feign saying: "I can hold on. We can't waste the family's resources because of me."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Little Shengzi, what incredible luck did you stumble upon to obtain a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was another elder from the Fu family, accompanied by another Nascent Soul cultivator, who wanted to contend for the ownership of the Harmonious Dao true technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">How fast could a Golden Core cultivator fly? Very quickly, a large group of people followed behind Fu Yuansheng.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luoyuan made a solemn promise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sheng'er, in less than two days, more than ten Nascent Soul cultivators have come knocking. Any one of them is someone our Fu family cannot afford to offend! For the future of the Fu family, why don't you hand over the cultivation technique?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, many onlookers followed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While two Nascent Soul cultivators were confronting each other, more Nascent Soul cultivators arrived upon hearing the news.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead of returning to the Fu family, he used the teleportation array and arrived at Tianquan Celestial City, openly appearing before the public.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stopped his flight, appearing to be extremely fearful of his own father.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is Senior Futongtian from Tianquan Prefecture. We are somewhat related by family."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fu Linmu continued to persuade with emotion and reason, then introduced the identity of the眯眼 Nascent Soul cultivator behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Behind Fu Linmu stood a cultivator with his arms crossed and his eyes slightly narrowed. Judging by his aura, he should be at the Nascent Soul stage.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your Harmonious Dao cultivation technique, our Fu family truly cannot protect it. If it falls into your hands, it will be a curse rather than a blessing. Why not hand it over to Senior Fu…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even those who were unaware quickly understood what was happening after hearing the inquiries of the surrounding cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unexpectedly, he didn't hide temporarily or use the teleportation array to transfer. Instead, as if he had lost his mind, he flew directly out of Tianquan City in his physical body.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The malice of human hearts, to this extent!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yuan Sheng, didn't the family treat you well these years? It's time for you to repay the family."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">That should be Fu Yuansheng's nominal father, Fu Linmu.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why not listen first to what this Fu family prodigy, Fu Yuansheng, has gleaned from Derivation Law Jade to deduce such a cultivation technique first?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The group of Nascent Soul cultivators quickly reached a consensus and unanimously looked at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Little did they know, this move was exactly what Li Fan wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before entering the Derivation Law Jade space, he had already calculated that he would use this cultivation technique to stir up trouble. Therefore, the foundational cultivation technique he provided to Derivation Law Jade was of an extremely high standard.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The resulting cultivation technique was naturally extraordinary, even having some effect on Li Fan in his current state.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, disguised as Fu Yuansheng, showed a pained expression. Finally, with a helpless sigh, he took a deep breath and said word by word: "The cultivation technique I obtained is called the [Heaven-Reaching Spirit Manifestation Art]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The current new methods are truly defying the heavens. However, to break through realms, one must rely on the various resources in heaven and earth. It's fine for those aristocratic families, but for those like us without power or influence, even with peerless talent, we are still limited!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words caused many cultivators present to be moved and feel a sense of empathy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan continued, "Therefore, I have always dreamed of one day escaping such limitations. Thanks to Senior Qian Xun's favor, I was gifted the [Jing Fa Jade Tablet], which finally allowed me to turn my dream into reality."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Heaven-Reaching Spirit Manifestation Art can continuously strengthen one's connection with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, greatly reducing the hostility of the Heavenly Dao. Then, through the connection with heaven and earth, it becomes easier to find the materials necessary for breakthroughs such as the Nascent Soul stage cave-heaven and the transformation of life and death. Even when cultivated to a profound level, it would be easy to sense the location of the primal essence of heaven and earth…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With this cultivation technique, as long as I, Fu Yuansheng, am given some time, achieving Harmonious Dao is not an absurd fantasy. But I didn't expect... I didn't expect..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Myriad Immortals Alliance actually pressures cultivators like me from the lower echelons to this extent! They give us no opportunity at all!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The more Li Fan spoke, the more indignant he became, his eyes filled with bloodshot rage.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He then waved his hand, directly revealing the grand outline of the [Heaven-Reaching Spirit Manifestation Art] for all to see.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With just a glance, the Harmonious Dao cultivators present recognized the extraordinary nature of this cultivation technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was certainly not something a mere Golden Core cultivator could fabricate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Nascent Soul cultivators present had various expressions. The atmosphere suddenly became tense and serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One of them erased the text on the sky screen and then scanned the crowd: "The value of this cultivation technique is self-evident. I believe no further explanation is needed."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, there are gaps between Harmonious Dao cultivation techniques. If this young man's words are true, the value of this Harmonious Dao cultivation technique is truly unprecedented in my life."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heh heh, I think even if all of you present were to die, as long as one could obtain the cultivation technique, it would be worth it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Nascent Soul cultivators interjected one after another, the atmosphere growing increasingly hostile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Fu family members present gradually wore looks of despair.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If they had known that Fu Yuansheng had comprehended such a supreme cultivation technique capable of establishing a cultivation family, they would have tried to protect him, no matter what!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if they had set more conditions when selling it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of the Fu family's regret,</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The final ownership of the Heaven-Reaching Spirit Manifestation Art was snatched by a newly ascended Harmonious Dao cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This person was known as "Immortal Venerable Chilliant," who had only recently broken through to the Harmonious Dao realm a few days prior.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He had not yet found a suitable cultivation technique and happened to hear of Fu Yuansheng's situation. Intrigued, he came to join the fun.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unexpectedly, he found a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a world of difference between Harmonious Dao and Nascent Soul. Chilliant wanted it, and the Nascent Soul cultivators present naturally could not compete with him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, Chilliant was not alone; he had the backing of a not-insignificant family.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ultimately, under the dual pressure of power, the Nascent Soul cultivators present withdrew from the competition.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To avoid further complications, the final victor, Immortal Venerable Chilliant, immediately demanded that Fu Yuansheng hand over the cultivation technique on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I hope that after obtaining this technique, Senior can still show some care to our Fu family."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan raised his head and sighed, his words causing the Fu family members present to feel ashamed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching Chilliant fly closer, Li Fan's divine sense transmitted the complete Heaven-Reaching Spirit Manifestation Art to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected of an supreme miraculous method," Chilliant said with great joy, his expression beaming.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fu boy, sign this contract, signifying that you voluntarily give up the ownership of the cultivation technique. Don't worry, I won't mistreat your Fu family…" Chilliant said solemnly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your junior obeys." Li Fan bowed his head, about to take the golden contract.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And just at this moment…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps influenced by the text of the Heaven-Reaching Spirit Manifestation Art, Chilliant suddenly felt his senses become somewhat hazy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Fu Yuansheng before him seemed to transform into a terrifying monster from nightmares, claws and teeth bared, lunging towards him. The next moment, he was about to pounce on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Chilliant jolted, instinctively unleashing a red light.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It struck Fu Yuansheng's body directly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The power of Harmonious Dao, even a casual, unintentional strike, how could a Golden Core cultivator withstand it?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With an expression of disbelief, Fu Yuansheng's body instantly disintegrated, vanishing into dust.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This sudden turn of events stunned everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All eyes were filled with shock as they stared at Immortal Venerable Chilliant, who had committed murder in public.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And Chilliant himself was somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He stared blankly at his own palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it be that after just breaking through, the influence of the world's essence on me hasn't completely faded?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fortunately, the [Heaven-Reaching Spirit Manifestation Art] is now in my possession." This was the second thought that flashed through Chilliant's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sheng'er!" After a dead silence, the Fu family members finally reacted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They cried out in grief and indignation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Many even disregarded the immense gap between themselves and the Harmonious Dao cultivator, staring at Chilliant with hateful eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Above them, the phenomenon of death arrived late, signifying the cause of Fu Yuansheng's demise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And Chilliant, the murderer, felt vaguely uncomfortable looking at these ants.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, given that he was in the wrong, he couldn't lash out in public.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He simply said, "Don't worry, I keep my word. I won't mistreat your Fu family..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Fu family's cries gradually subsided.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, the person was dead, and it was not worth risking death by defying a Harmonious Dao cultivator for the sake of a deceased individual.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Chilliant left with the Fu family members.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other Nascent Soul cultivators also sighed with emotion: "It seems the cultivation technique was too precious. Immortal Venerable Chilliant chose to silence the witnesses to ensure absolute secrecy."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"He doesn't even trust the contract? This newly-ascended Harmonious Dao cultivator is too suspicious!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the contract? There are many wondrous techniques in the world; perhaps there's a way to breach the contract without punishment?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even with so many people watching, if it were in private, his actions would surely be even more unrestrained!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Harmonious Dao cultivators are truly awe-inspiring! The laws of the Immortal Alliance seem to become trivial at their level!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Naturally. Even a fool would know that the Immortal Alliance would never punish a Harmonious Dao cultivator for the sake of a mere Golden Core cultivator. Even if they did, it would likely be just for show."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Once one enters the Harmonious Dao, everything changes. Just like the outbound rainbow light before, which could roam the Star Sea, it is only accessible to Harmonious Dao cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Nascent Soul cultivators chatted animatedly before dispersing one by one.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the large number of Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and Nascent Soul cultivators who remained on the scene lingered for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They looked up at the lingering phenomenon of death in the sky, a sense of sorrow for fallen companions welling up in their hearts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the influence of some imperceptible force, this emotion gradually transformed into a blazing flame of anger, slowly igniting.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the eyes of the higher echelons of the Immortal Alliance, we are truly no different from ants."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the promised laws of the Immortal Alliance? It turns out they only apply to us?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Today, Fu Yuansheng died unjustly. Tomorrow, who among us will be next?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the silence, a strange atmosphere was brewing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although no words were spoken, the mutual glances conveyed everything.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, due to the deterrence of the Immortal Alliance, none of them dared to voice their thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They only needed an opportunity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, the surrounding cultivators finally dispersed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's divine sense, in the form of a wisp of remnant soul, reappeared in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The flames have been lit, and I probably won't need to fan them; they will burn throughout the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance." Li Fan was very pleased with his own work.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And the subsequent developments unfolded exactly as he had predicted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Immortal Venerable Chilliant's act of killing Fu Yuansheng in broad daylight was rapidly spread throughout the Myriad Immortals Alliance via the Heaven-Probing Mirrors, due to the Fu family's statement that Chilliant had merely made a mistake due to his unstable realm after just breaking through, they expressed their forgiveness. Thus, the Immortal Alliance did not pursue the matter further, only imposing a symbolic penalty of contribution points.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Conversely, the Heaven-Reaching Spirit Manifestation Art, which Immortal Venerable Chilliant obtained, became widely discussed after its news spread, causing numerous families to inquire about its authenticity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And they all expressed their willingness to pay a hefty sum to have Chilliant help them sense and locate the whereabouts of the primal essence of heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In a short time, Chilliant, who had just ascended to Harmonious Dao, found his status even higher than some veteran Harmonious Dao cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the innocent Fu Yuansheng, he was gradually forgotten as time passed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Sacred Dynasty of Da Qi, Wang Xuanba read the article in his hand and sighed, "It's truly ironic! The guilty are not punished but rewarded."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If this were in our Da Qi, let alone ordinary officials, even I, the Saint Emperor's direct disciple, if I committed such an offense, I would be severely punished. At the very least, I'd be imprisoned in the Nether Prison for hundreds of years. How could it be so lightly dismissed? The Myriad Immortals Alliance is truly good... ah, no, the Myriad Immortals Alliance is truly corrupt!" Ou Shangtian shook his head repeatedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang glanced at Ou Shangtian and chuckled helplessly, "Master's intention is that this matter can be used as a typical example for propaganda. As a mobilization before the battle."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, we can even use this opportunity to shake the foundations of the Immortal Alliance. After all, the vast majority of cultivators in the Myriad Immortals Alliance are only at the Harmonious Dao realm and below."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian curled his lips, "What's the use of roping in these wastes? No matter how many come, I'll kill them all!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang's expression changed: "Stop your reckless talk! 'He who gains the Dao has many helpers, he who loses the Dao has few.' The Myriad Immortals Alliance has lost the hearts of the people, and our Sacred Dynasty's conquest is in line with the will of the people."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To have legitimacy and act righteously is the way to be invincible!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, he was the senior disciple. Ou Shangtian dared not refute, only muttering in a low voice, "No matter what you say, in the end, it all comes down to strength."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a period of banter, the fellow disciples returned to the main topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Shangtian, how is the construction of your Myriad Transference Array coming along?" Sun Erlang asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian showed a proud expression: "Brother Sun, you can rest assured when I handle things. We have already completed the positioning for all prefectures of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. As soon as Master gives the order, our Da Qi soldiers can instantly travel through the Myriad Transference Array to various designated prefectures. Then, using the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat, with the cover of the white mist barrier, we can guarantee to descend beneath the celestial cities of each prefecture stealthily!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba also added, "The several spies embedded within the Immortal Alliance have also completed their liaison. Once the time is right, the Heaven-Probing Mirrors and teleportation altars in each prefecture of the Immortal Alliance will all become defunct."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A miniature map of the Immortal Alliance's territories appeared before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, each prefecture will become an isolated island, preoccupied with its own survival. Their strength has already been assessed. We can defeat them one by one."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The most critical aspect is the four central prefectures of the Immortal Alliance and the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After scanning the list of major cultivators stationed in each prefecture, Sun Erlang focused his gaze on the center of the miniature map.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After pondering for a moment, Sun Erlang said, "Master subtly revealed when he summoned me before. At that time, he will use an earth-shattering method to directly seal off the four central prefectures and the Immortal Alliance headquarters. We should not have to worry about support from the Immortal Alliance headquarters; we only need to focus on quickly resolving the battles in each prefecture."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Additionally, there are the Immortal Alliance secret realms hidden within the white mist and various prefectures. We will seal them before the war begins. Places like the Hidden Dragon Abyss, Fengwu City, Cangmang Mountain, and Chizha Immortal City, although each is not heavily garrisoned, collectively they are not to be underestimated. We must defeat them individually."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other disciples listened solemnly to Sun Erlang's explanation of the conquest plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only Ou Shangtian said with a playful smile, "I have personally experienced the formation skills of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. They are simply not worth mentioning. Master's personally created sealing formation is more than enough to trap them for half a year to a year!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's just that the materials needed for setting up the formation might be a bit scarce?" Ou Shangtian suddenly frowned, asking in confusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang smiled and took out a piece of [Empty Light Mother Stone] from his embrace, placing it before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian scanned the supplies contained within the Mother Stone and was so astonished that he stood up abruptly: "So much? Did you steal the Myriad Immortals Alliance's treasury?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang chuckled, "Master gave me three such Mother Stones. Each one is packed to the brim. As far as I know, Senior Ou Daozi also has ample supplies granted by Master. So, you don't need to worry about strategic resources. Just focus on preparing the formations."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ou Shangtian's eyes lit up upon hearing his father's name, and he repeatedly nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang then looked at the Su Yuqing and Liu Li duo, who had remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since they were sent by the Saint Emperor to guard the dark underground world, they had truly become tainted by the darkness and changed their personalities, becoming considerably more taciturn.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Junior Sister, how is the mobilization of the small world reinforcements progressing?" Sun Erlang asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's faster than we anticipated. Don't worry, the Myriad Realms Allied Forces will definitely arrive on the battlefield on time," Su Yuqing said softly, her tone carrying a resilience that was previously absent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While educating the Abyssal race in the dark underground world, she had vaguely sensed a possible connection between the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao and the inhabitants of that realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Coupled with her own fortuitous encounter in the Border Realm where she gained the favor of the Heavenly Dao, she naturally gained the trust of the small world's Heavenly Dao more easily than other cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Leveraging this advantage, under the Saint Emperor's orders, she traveled among different small worlds.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Using both gentle persuasion and coercion, she assembled a "United Myriad Realms" force with terrifying efficiency.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although she didn't hold high expectations for the actual combat effectiveness of this allied army, its grand mobilization alone was undoubtedly effective in boosting morale.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Most importantly, it prevented them from interfering with the Sacred Dynasty and the Myriad Immortals Alliance's decisive battle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, where did Senior Sister Lin Ling go? I haven't seen her around lately," Ou Shangtian suddenly asked curiously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang replied vaguely, "She has her own assigned mission from Master, so I'm not entirely sure. However, rest assured, she will definitely not miss this grand feast."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The disciples all looked at the miniature map of the Myriad Immortals Alliance in the center again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their eyes were filled with impatience.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sacred Dynasty Secret Realm, a testing ground or academy built for Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren scratched his scalp, pushing back the true self Dao foundation that had re-emerged from the cracks in the skull.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He said with some uncertainty, "Is doing this too hasty?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With my Foundation Establishment method, it's considered a complete success. As for the Primordial Golden Core, I've only deduced half of it. The rest, further beyond, are all castles in the air, illusions in a mirror, beautiful at first glance but shattering at a touch, unable to withstand scrutiny!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Saint Emperor Li Ping sat at a wooden table, occasionally flipping through illusory texts, revising them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Around him, phenomena resembling a galaxy, born from his enlightenment, twisted and flickered in and out of existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren forced himself to shift his gaze away from the astonishing scene. After a long while, the Saint Emperor finished flipping through the entire illusory book and began revising from the first page.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He then responded, "As the saying goes, 'When the true becomes false, the false also becomes true.' As long as we make the cultivators of the world believe that this is a 'new method' that allows independent cultivation, breaking away from the lineage cultivation system…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if it's only for a few days, it's enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, with the profound obscurity of the new method, completely contrary to the lineage method, how long do you think it will take Xuanhuang cultivators to verify its authenticity?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor spoke as he once again used his hand as a brush to revise the illusory book built upon the new method.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren did not answer, only repeating the phrase '[When the true becomes false, the false also becomes true]' in his mouth. After a long time, he suddenly realized, "That's right. Precisely because there was no new method before in the world, once we announce it, and the most easily verifiable Foundation Establishment method is genuine, they will naturally assume that all subsequent cultivation techniques are also real."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And my repeated revisions are merely to perfect this deception," the Saint Emperor said with a self-deprecating smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But what's the point? Ultimately, it cannot shake the foundation of lineage cultivation!" Yin Shangren scratched his scalp again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Lineage methods and new methods are incompatible. To cultivate, one must switch paths and establish a new trajectory. Perhaps one in a thousand would choose to do so, but after all, it's a matter of gaining some and losing some."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"More importantly…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Saint Emperor spoke, he completed another revision of the illusory book.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He made no further changes and instead closed the illusory book.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Placing his hands on it, illusory starlight churned on the book. In less than a breath, the illusory book, which was merely a fictitious light and shadow, actually became a tangible [book] that truly existed in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He handed this [new method] to Yin Shangren and said, "More importantly, if we announce the new method, and the Immortal Alliance is powerless against us…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Law Transmitter will definitely rush back from the distant Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor said gravely.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is called 'attack what they must save'."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A glimmer flashed in Yin Shangren's eyes, and he slowly nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Do you have confidence in ascending the Law Transmitter?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After hesitating for a moment, Yin Shangren asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's merely a gamble." The Saint Emperor paused, then said frankly.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-298" class="calibre1">Chapter 1287: Strange Change in the Sea of Stars Begins</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A desperate gamble..." Yin Shangren fell silent upon receiving the answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's no need to worry. I have already made my plans. Regardless of victory or defeat, the orthodox Xuanhuang lineage will be re-established. You and Xu Ke should just do what you need to do," Saint Emperor Li Ping said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But..." Yin Shangren still hesitated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the Law Transmitter reveals himself, it will be the moment the Sacred Dynasty army launches its full-scale attack on the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters. You two will sneak into the [Museum of Divine Treasures] amidst the chaos and retrieve Mister Bai's skull. At this stage, victory or defeat is a matter of grand momentum. Although you are both not weak, you cannot influence the overall situation. Moreover, the Muppet Sage is in charge of the crucial artifact [Era]. Even the most mediocre being, after countless simulations and deductions, can create miracles. Do not underestimate them!" Li Ping said with solemnity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's words carried some weight with Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He no longer argued, but instead narrowed his eyes in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he pondered, Yin Shangren's scalp began to make a rustling sound, like silkworms crawling. His scalp undulated, as if something would break through the cracks on his head at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren suddenly became annoyed, while Li Ping flashed to his side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a gentle caress of his palm, starlight permeated the area, and the anomaly gradually subsided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the 'Rebellion of True Self.' Suppressing it forcefully is not a good solution," the Saint Emperor immediately recognized the problem and suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren's face was filled with helplessness. "Starting cultivation halfway, after all, is not the same as from the beginning. It is bound to leave all sorts of after-effects. I initially thought that as long as I consumed my original imperfect Dao foundation and cultivated anew with [Building My Dao], everything would be fine. But a while ago, I heard your sermon in the Star Sea and had a new realization. Only then did I know that my complete self was not entirely complete. With the foundation shaken, it indeed requires further adjustment."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't worry, I will resolve it before the decisive battle arrives," Yin Shangren guaranteed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's good that you have it under control."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's voice echoed, but his figure had already disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren looked around and was stunned to find that the incomplete [New Method], which had been transformed from void into reality and taken by the Saint Emperor at the long table where the Saint Emperor had sat, had reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Knowing that the Saint Emperor had deliberately left it for him, Yin Shangren did not hesitate. He immediately picked it up and began to study it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Marvelous..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it was merely compiled to deceive the world, this half-volume New Method was still unfathomably mysterious in Yin Shangren's eyes, almost like a true divine technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, he was completely engrossed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sacred Dynasty, Five Elements Great Cavern-world, Fire Element Cavern-world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An endless sea of fire, roaring flames erupted like surging tidal waves, soaring straight into the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scorching flames, like wild stallions, gnawed at everything within the cavern-world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And in the deepest part of this purgatorial scene, a golden glazed flower bloomed. No matter how the surrounding flames raged, the flower remained clear and unaffected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the center of the glazed flower, an image of a world flickered faintly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Occasionally, a wisp of golden light floated from the glazed world within the flower. Upon contact with this golden light, the surrounding flames instantly ignited and burned even more fiercely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If viewed from high above, one could see Daoist Bai Hua, using the golden light glaze as a guide, continuously refining the fire element cavern-world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to when it was first captured, not only the fire element cavern-world, but the entire Five Elements Great Cavern-world had almost doubled in size. Daoist Bai Hua could be said to have made an invaluable contribution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor Li Ping's figure flashed beside the golden light glaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The raging flames immediately subsided. They didn't even dare to approach, only swaying from a distance, as if trying to please him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You've done well. The fire element cavern-world has been managed excellently."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And the other cavern-worlds as well," Li Ping said indifferently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His gaze pierced through the Heaven's Veil of the Five Elements Great Cavern-world and reached the void beyond.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Five Elements Great Cavern-world, like a robust navigator, led the Sacred Dynasty's Great Qi through the void at high speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And around it, more than a hundred small worlds of various sizes were also being dragged along.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the Sacred Dynasty's Great Qi at the core, they vaguely formed a formation, like a giant warship, awe-inspiring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's just doing my part. If not for the Saint Emperor's reward of the Myriad Spirits Nectar, I wouldn't have been able to achieve this," Bai Hua bowed and said, approaching Li Ping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua also looked in the direction Li Ping was gazing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief silence, she couldn't help but sigh, "I can't believe that such a magnificent scene was created by me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Most of them are no smaller than my hometown."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Next, I'll have to trouble you again. Send this Five Elements Great Cavern-world back to the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Ping's voice came at the opportune moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua was slightly stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor, however, chuckled and explained, "The time for evasion is over. Now is the time for close combat. Let this be the vanguard!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as the Saint Emperor uttered these words, the surrounding flames seemed to receive encouragement and surged fiercely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daoist Bai Hua also noticed that within the roaring fire element cavern-world, besides the flames themselves, there was a deep shadow flowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a terrifying existence that could threaten her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor extended his palm, and the shadow flowed, quickly coming to rest in his palm, transforming into a cute little bug with a tiger-like head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looked chubby and harmless, but Bai Hua knew very well how terrifying this little thing was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fire element cavern-world they were currently in, and even the entire Five Elements Great Cavern-world, were merely avatars of this black bug.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For years, Bai Hua had been tending to the cavern-world, but more accurately, she had been raising this bug named [Dao Yi].</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With [Dao Yi]'s help, dragging the cavern-world back won't be as strenuous as when you came,"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You only need to return the Five Elements Great Cavern-world to its rightful place. Dao Yi will handle everything else," the Saint Emperor instructed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Ping spoke, starlight emanated from his palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dao Yi bug seemed somewhat proud. Its chubby body intimately rubbed against Li Ping's palm, then greedily devoured the specks of starlight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its black body seemed to become more solid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Go."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping gently patted it. Although the Dao Yi bug was reluctant, it was very obedient. The shadow dissipated, and it returned to the surrounding cavern-world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding flames instantly became even more vigorous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daoist Bai Hua could also sense that the entire cavern-world seemed to have come alive instantly. Being inside it felt like being within the belly of a behemoth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sense of danger that constantly arose made Bai Hua restless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping also noticed Bai Hua's unusual behavior and took her outside the Five Elements Great Cavern-world into the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor tapped his finger, and the Five Elements Great Cavern-world detached itself from the Sacred Dynasty's Great Qi void battleship formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't worry. Dao Yi will only execute my orders loyally."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the Saint Emperor said so, Bai Hua could only nod. Suppressing the fear in her heart, she transformed into golden light and flew towards the Five Elements Great Cavern-world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Five Rings Cavern-world was instantly tinged with a golden edge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rumble!</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the initial roar, the relocation of the cavern-world became absolutely silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the concealment of the Saint Emperor's formation, even if one passed by the moving behemoth, they might not notice its movement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching the Five Elements Great Cavern-world return home, Li Ping secretly pondered, "In Dao Yi's current state, it is fully capable of altering the spiritual energy of the entire Xuanhuang Realm without a sound."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not only targeting the Myriad Immortals Alliance, but it can also use this opportunity to stimulate the Xuanhuang Realm and further ignite its revival."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since comprehending the Dao in the center of the Star Sea last time, the Xuanhuang Realm had briefly erupted with signs of revival. However, it was ultimately like water without a source, and after this period, the signs of revival had gradually stagnated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The new buds on the branches of the Wutong tree were beginning to turn yellow again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The transformed Five Elements Great Cavern-world, through the Dao Yi bug, was like a potent medicine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Spiritual energy was an extremely crucial component of the Xuanhuang Realm. If it were eroded, it would inevitably trigger a fierce reaction from the Xuanhuang Realm's own instincts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao Yi's mission, besides creating a battle environment suitable for the Sacred Dynasty's soldiers, is most importantly to continuously transform and devour the foreign cultivation worlds that have been merged over thousands of years."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"After the great battle ends, Dao Yi will perish. The spiritual energy will return to its proper course, and Dao Yi's remains, those foreign worlds, can then nourish the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Through this bug calamity, the Xuanhuang Realm itself will become much stronger. Coupled with the [Orthodox Xuanhuang] method I previously laid down, regardless of whether I or the Law Transmitter wins, the Xuanhuang Realm will hold an absolute advantage in the future integration of various realms."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor continuously deduced various scenarios of the upcoming great battle in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gazing into the distance, he saw through layers of time and space to Daoist Bai Hua successfully dragging the bug-transformed Five Elements Great Cavern-world back to its rightful place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the silent roar of heaven and earth, the Five Elements Great Cavern-world returned to Tianling Prefecture and began to emit pulses of abnormal spiritual energy outwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiritual energy concentration of the Xuanhuang Realm would rise slightly in a short period.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cultivators would find it difficult to detect the abnormality of this newly generated spiritual energy. Only when [Bug Transformation] was activated would they be caught off guard and lose their "right to use" the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing the plan proceeding smoothly, Saint Emperor Li Ping finally withdrew his gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He stomped his foot and returned to the Sacred Dynasty's Great Qi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Deep within the Saint Emperor's throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The core of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Grand Array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, numerous other formations like the Sentient Beings Refinement Formation were layered on top. Even the consciousness of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, which was closely connected to the Saint Emperor, would be severed here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This ensured that all external prying eyes would be blocked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's disciple, Lin Ling, formerly a spirit wood avatar from the Spiritual Wood Realm, had now revealed her true form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, what looked peculiar was that the tree was inverted, with its crown at the bottom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dense roots extended upwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The buildings of the Sacred Dynasty, such as the Heroic Spirit Seat, the Sacred Medicine Institute, the Sacred Academy, the Sacred Heart Hall, and the Sacred Supervision Court, were all connected to the roots of the inverted spiritual wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the heart of the tree, all scenes that occurred within the Sacred Dynasty's Great Qi were synchronized and displayed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After playing back a scene, it transformed into green light and was absorbed by the inverted spiritual wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping looked at the inverted spiritual wood before him, a rare hint of hesitation flashing in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To consider defeat before victory, this is truly great wisdom!" Li Ping said beside him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the Daoist Yijue of the Du'er Sect, who was complaining incessantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He sat on the Book of Du'er, his eyes fixed on the inverted spiritual wood before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, Your Majesty's plan this time is for the Xuanhuang Realm, not for yourself, so it can't be considered a blow to your morale," Daoist Yijue continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He occasionally cast hand seals, causing the roots of the inverted spiritual wood to sway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And at the heart of the tree, the absorption of the Great Qi's light became even faster.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, the Saint Emperor stopped his movements.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He suddenly spoke, "This battle with the Myriad Immortals Alliance, your Du'er Sect need not intervene."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just as I said before, hide in secret and observe..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Whether there are other prying eyes," the Saint Emperor deliberately added.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The battle between the Sacred Dynasty and the Immortal Alliance is a change in the Xuanhuang Realm unseen in ten thousand years. If that force secretly observing the Xuanhuang Realm is still active, it will inevitably supervise this matter and then transmit the information. I do not ask you to find the final destination of the information. Just confirm whether the event has occurred," the Saint Emperor instructed word by word.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daoist Yijue's tightly furrowed brow finally began to slowly relax.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He clapped his hands and praised, "Your Majesty's actions are truly in line with the Great Dao of our Du'er Sect. If Your Majesty is willing, I can even abdicate the position of Sect Master of the Du'er Sect..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before Daoist Yijue could finish speaking, the Saint Emperor interrupted him, "Regardless of whether I or the Law Transmitter wins, you must report the result to the victor. As for after completing the mission... you are free to go."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daoist Yijue did not show the joy of imminent freedom; instead, he looked surprised. He pointed his blurry hand at the inverted spiritual wood, "I'm not going with you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor chuckled, "This [Outlying Wood]'s only living being is Lin Ling, the main body. I have not made any arrangements for you. Do you Du'er Sect still expect to follow?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daoist Yijue's face instantly crumpled, "Your Majesty, please reconsider. Can that newly born tree spirit accomplish anything alone? The Star Sea is vast; perhaps it will encounter some disaster and perish halfway." "Isn't this escape method of Your Majesty's going to be half-hearted..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping, however, waved his hand, interrupting him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Staring at the inverted spiritual wood, he corrected, "It is not an escape method, but information preservation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daoist Yijue sighed sadly, "What's the difference?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping narrowed his eyes and remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This [Outlying Wood] not only preserved records of all events that had occurred in the Sacred Dynasty since its inception but also transferred the true spirits and memories of those who had fallen in the Heroic Spirit Seat during this period.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a contingency plan established by the Saint Emperor, inspired by the 'immortality of information' theory of the Taiyan Sect, for the entire Sacred Dynasty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or perhaps, "proof" would be a more appropriate term.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If Li Ping won, there would be no need to mention it. The Outlying Wood would not activate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if Li Ping lost, then upon the destruction of the Great Qi, the Outlying Wood would carry the true spirits of the Sacred Dynasty's citizens and fly into the depths of the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it were a physical entity, it would be unable to escape the Law Transmitter's interception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if it were merely information, the Law Transmitter might not care.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the Du'er Sect would create some interference at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was not because the Saint Emperor was wavering about the decisive battle. After all, there were no arrangements for any living beings on the Outlying Wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was because the Saint Emperor wished to leave behind a testament to the existence of his countless subjects who had followed and believed in him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping knew that during the thousands of years of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's rule over half of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Dynasty's Great Qi was not the first to rebel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There had been an incident five hundred years ago where various realms united in rebellion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But after their failure, all information about them was erased and sealed by the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if these failed rebels had never existed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping's actions were to prevent such a thing from happening again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if we lose, our existence will not be erased!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If, after countless years, the Outlying Wood returns to the Xuanhuang Realm and attracts the attention of future generations, that would be even better."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Various thoughts flashed through Li Ping's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A flicker of emotion surged, then was quickly suppressed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Law Transmitter Heavenly Venerate." Li Ping repeated the name silently in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, with his current strength, he already had a thirty percent chance of not losing to the Law Transmitter, and even winning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, after comprehending the Dao in the Star Sea, he had understood the current limitations of this Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the Law Transmitter had dominated the Xuanhuang Realm for nearly ten thousand years, he had definitely not broken the current limits of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But what made Li Ping feel a vague sense of unease was the shadow behind the Law Transmitter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Heavenly Physician.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Li Ping knew little about this person, a vague intuition told him that this person was definitely not to be underestimated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being able to conspire with the Law Transmitter, his strength should not be weak either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can still deal with the Law Transmitter alone, but if the Heavenly Physician is added..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the situation was not optimistic, the Saint Emperor's decision to launch a general offensive in three years was not impulsive. Three years later was an extremely special time point.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The peculiarity was not within the Xuanhuang Realm, but throughout the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea. Three years later, the Star Sea would erupt with a surge of primal force recovery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, the recuperation force from the Star Sea would engage in a large-scale conflict with the residual calamity forces scattered throughout the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the mutual collision of these two massive forces, any cultivator within the Star Sea who had not yet reached a level capable of resisting both would inevitably be affected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This applied to cultivators who had attained Dao in the Star Sea, as well as believers of the calamity forces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And this impact would manifest as a significant weakening of the upper limit of their strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as larger beings experienced more wind and waves in the ocean, cultivators with higher cultivation levels would be more deeply affected by the Star Sea's forces and calamity forces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Law Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician, two beings at the pinnacle of the Star Sea, would be forcibly suppressed for a short period.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the Saint Emperor's strength would also be weakened, on one hand, a large part of his combat strength came from the Sacred Dynasty's luck. As long as the Sacred Dynasty did not fall, his strength could always remain relatively stable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, he had a mysterious connection with the Star Sea's primal force. Protected by it, compared to other beings in the Star Sea, he would only need to face the backlash of the calamity forces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Through brief communication with the Star Sea's primal force, I confirmed that there were no cultivators who had contacted it before me. Although I don't know why the Law Transmitter and the others haven't discovered the Star Sea's primal force recovery over the past ten thousand years, it is undoubtedly fortunate for me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not only did it significantly reduce the gap between us, but I can also borrow the power of this vast Star Sea to some extent."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, compared to the Xuanhuang Realm's lack of options, this Star Sea is currently undergoing vigorous rebirth, and my power is too meager. I only have one chance..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor stood before the inverted spiritual wood, deducing various possible scenarios of the decisive battle three years later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He remained unmoved, regardless of Daoist Yijue's repeated persuasion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, if I could borrow the power of the calamity forces, the chances of victory might increase."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor couldn't help but think this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And he would never have imagined that at the far end of the Star Sea, a group of beings attempting to control the Star Sea's calamity forces had also discerned the impending anomaly three years later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuanxianzhou, Broken Immortal Tower.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhao Xian, also known as the Saint Embryo Li Fan, who was in seclusion, was urgently summoned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the general meeting of all core members of the Broken Immortal Tower, Ai Tianjue delivered a speech, announcing an event that might have a major impact on the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The residual calamity forces in various parts of the Star Sea are constantly strengthening, expected to reach their peak within three years?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Affected by this, the True Immortal power attached to the relics on the Sea of Relics will also resonate. The normal fluctuations will greatly intensify, providing us with an excellent opportunity to search for effective World-Extinguishing Relics. This opportunity is a once-in-a-millennium chance!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If all goes well, we might be able to gather enough relics for the next hundred years in one go!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing Ai Tianjue's report, everyone became extremely excited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, due to the scarcity of World-Extinguishing Relics, the Broken Immortal Tower's research on True Immortal scripts had been progressing very slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Often, several cultivators had to share the same relic. Only the true leaders and their disciples had the opportunity to have exclusive use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Almost every cultivator in the Broken Immortal Tower was confident that their talent was no less than others. If they could each have sufficient relics to study, the research difficulty would undoubtedly be greatly reduced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What I'm more concerned about is why this phenomenon is occurring," came the voice of Chi Gongdao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was not present at the meeting, and only his voice, carried by a brush made of flesh and hair, spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flesh and hair brush constantly danced in the void, drawing and gesturing: "The Immortal Boat has always meticulously recorded the fluctuations of calamity forces. Never before has there been such an abnormal phenomenon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And abnormality either means opportunity, or it represents..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Misfortune!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flesh and hair brush wrote a character in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A peculiar fluctuation emanated from the character, giving everyone present an involuntary feeling of bone-chilling cold, as if they were standing beside a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Gongdao, stop fooling around," said a blue-haired elder sternly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He gazed at the character, and it was actually absorbed into his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The speaker was Gan Jingda, the second elder of the Broken Immortal Tower and the host of this meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After stopping Chi Gongdao's antics, Gan Jingda said solemnly, "However, what you said is not entirely without merit. In fact, the several of us have already analyzed it privately."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This anomaly is different from the previous Star Power ebbing and flowing. I'm afraid its origin stems from this Star Sea itself."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, the entire venue fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone was contemplating the deeper meaning of this statement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were not foolish people, and they understood the implications of this sentence very well. Their current source of power came from the residual True Immortal power in the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But for the entire Star Sea, this power was an alien entity, an anomaly that needed to be purged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the current trend, there was no possibility of the two merging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What would be the possible outcomes of the impending anomaly?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Would the calamity forces go out of control? For the Xuanxianzhou, which was already struggling to survive, precarious like walking on thin ice, this might not necessarily be a good thing. Even if they could utilize more True Immortal power in the future, the corresponding crises they would face would also increase synchronously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the price of mortals attempting to wield True Immortal power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And if the Star Sea gained the upper hand, the future for the Xuanxianzhou would be even more bleak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They, the remnants of True Immortal power, would undoubtedly experience a significant decline in strength after losing their former powerful tools. Unless they were willing to change their allegiance and return to the path of enlightenment and cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But...</p>
<p class="calibre2">A subtle atmosphere circulated amongst them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having tasted the power of commanding True Immortal power with a simple gesture, who would be willing to painstakingly cultivate slowly?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ai Tianjue coughed lightly, breaking the silence in the venue. "Everything is still conjecture at this point; there is no concrete evidence."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanxianzhou has endured countless trials since ancient times. I believe we will be able to safely overcome this anomaly as well."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cultivators responded with applause.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, this anomaly is of great importance. Starting today, the Immortal Boat will enter a state of emergency preparedness."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Be prepared to enter wartime status at any time," Gan Jingda announced the purpose of the meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although no one objected, the heavy expressions on their faces were evident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just then, Li Fan suddenly spoke, attracting everyone's attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the anomaly occurs, will the suction from the Star Sea also be affected?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I heard before that beyond the Star Sea, there is a realm called Xuanhuang Realm. Compared to our Immortal Boat, that relatively intact cultivation world has far more abundant resources. It was previously considered too far and affected by the Star Sea's suction, making it not worth the trip for the Immortal Boat. But now..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan spoke, everyone's eyes lit up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda and Ai Tianjue exchanged glances, seemingly discussing something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, under the expectant gazes of the crowd, Gan Jingda said, "Regarding the feasibility of this matter, the Elder Council will conduct a thorough assessment after research."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If it is feasible..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps our Immortal Boat can find a place to settle in the realm beyond the Star Sea."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-299" class="calibre1">Chapter 1288: Immortal Artifact Connects Two Realms</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The atmosphere of the meeting reached its peak with the announcement of Gan Jingda's resolution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A realm that was still intact and abundant in resources, something that had only existed in the fantasies of the Immortal Boat's inhabitants, now seemed within reach. How could this not stir their hearts and minds?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before the meeting, the vast majority of cultivators on the Profound Immortal Boat had only a limited understanding of the Xuanhuang Realm, primarily gleaned from the captured flying boat that originated from it. After the meeting, they began a frantic effort to learn more about the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Profound Immortal Boat had a long history. Although it had suffered the tragedy of splitting into two, its heritage had not been severed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten days after the council ended, a detailed report on the Xuanhuang Realm was compiled by the joint efforts of the Immortal Severing Tower, the Immortal Pivot Institute, the Proving Dao Academy, and the major families of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Severing Tower contributed the most content, derived from the confession of Lan Yu, who had been captured and attained the Harmonious Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The content from the Immortal Pivot Institute and other organizations originated from records left behind during the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's several secret visits to the Xuanhuang Realm before the great calamity of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At a small-scale meeting among the Profound Immortal Boat's higher-ups, this Xuanhuang report was distributed to everyone present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Li Fan's status was not high enough, he was brought along as Ai Tianjue's disciple to attend.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Currently, we cannot definitively determine the extent to which the Star Sea anomaly in three years will develop. Therefore, whether we can expedition to Xuanhuang still requires further observation. However, this does not preclude us from making preparations," said Lu Yu Zhi, a refined man and one of the six cultivators who had attained the Dao from the Immortal Severing Tower, as he summarized the findings for the attendees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please look..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Our Profound Merchant Immortal Boat, in ancient times, had visited the Xuanhuang Realm three times. One was a formal visit, warmly received by the Xuanhuang Realm. The other two were for gathering resources, conducted secretly. At that time, the Xuanhuang Realm had two special products that were considered priceless even throughout the entire Star Sea. One was the [Fruit of the Ruomu], and the other was the [Immortal Realm Gifted Artifact]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Fruit of the Ruomu contains the most primordial life essence of the Xuanhuang Realm. For cultivators who consume it, their lifespan can be greatly increased."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for this Immortal Realm Gifted Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yu Zhi paused, and Li Fan could detect a slight tremor in his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Realm, according to records, was one of the few cultivation worlds that had the most frequent contact with the Immortal Realm in ancient times. Therefore, it received a considerable number of Immortal Artifacts as rewards. Some of these Immortal Artifacts, over the passage of time, gradually became unclaimed. There were specialized cultivators in the Star Sea who went to the Xuanhuang Realm to secretly gather information on these lost Immortal Artifacts, attempting to seek exorbitant profits."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although the success rate was extremely low, they did succeed a few times. Our Profound Immortal Boat's two secret visits back then were actually to provide support for those who succeeded."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yu Zhi's words immediately caused a stir in the audience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even some of the Immortal Boat's high-ranking officials had never heard of such secrets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of the two Immortal Artifacts we collected from the Xuanhuang Realm, one was resold before the Star Sea calamity arrived. The other, during the incident where the Immortal Boat split, fell into the hands of the [Merchant Immortal Boat]," Lu Yu Zhi said with regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone's breathing hitched, and expressions of intense resentment appeared on their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda, the second elder of the Immortal Severing Tower, coughed lightly, suppressing the murmurs in the room, and gestured for Lu Yu Zhi to continue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although the Immortal Artifacts that flowed out of the Xuanhuang Realm are no longer in our possession, our Immortal Boat still retains the [Fruit of the Ruomu]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yu Zhi sought permission and the representative from the Immortal Pivot Institute from the audience cast several spells.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the radiant light, a crystal-clear, round fruit resembling white jade appeared before everyone's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even under layers of restrictive seals, the cultivators present could still feel the surging vitality emanating from this Fruit of the Ruomu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the cultivators of the Immortal Boat, who were facing severe resource shortages, this was undoubtedly a great temptation. Even the high-ranking officials present had never enjoyed such a treasure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of them stared intently at the Fruit of the Ruomu, swallowing their saliva.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan also observed it carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A familiar aura."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is indeed from a Ruomu, but the vibrant life force emanating from the fruit is not something that the current Ruomu can produce. It seems the injury to the Ruomu back then was truly severe."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's heart stirred. He noticed that faint wisps of life force seemed to be emanating from the Ruomu fruit and disappearing into the void, or rather, flowing into the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yu Zhi said in a deep voice, "Everyone should understand that the life force of this Fruit of the Ruomu has been dissipating for ten thousand years. Even though our Immortal Boat has used many secret techniques over the generations to greatly slow down the rate of life force dissipation, we are ultimately unable to stop this process."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone in the audience exclaimed, "Ten thousand years of life force dissipation, and the life force nurtured within is still so powerful. It's truly hard to imagine what the original Fruit of the Ruomu was like."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No wonder it's called a priceless treasure throughout the entire Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm, strange. Such a treasure, how could those old fellows from the Immortal Pivot Institute hold onto it and not devour it directly?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the discussions, someone seized upon a key point in Lu Yu Zhi's introduction of the Fruit of the Ruomu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Lu, do you mean that the life force dissipating from this Fruit of the Ruomu is returning to the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone fell silent upon hearing this. Their gazes shifted towards the Fruit of the Ruomu, filled not only with greed and desire but also with a different kind of meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yu Zhi nodded: "Precisely!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea is vast and boundless. Even that Xuanhuang Lan Yu we captured could not remember the way back. But through this Fruit of the Ruomu, we can accurately pinpoint the location of the Xuanhuang Realm in the vast Star Sea!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of silence, fierce discussions erupted again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Does the Xuanhuang Realm still have the Fruit of the Ruomu? If we each had one, the taste would be unimaginable..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No wonder those fellows from the Immortal Pivot Institute didn't devour it. Although the treasure is good, it is entangled with the origin power of another cultivation world. For other cultivators, it might be fine, but for the wielders of the Immortal Boat, they absolutely cannot. Unless they are willing to give up their position."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait, can such a coincidence exist? Moreover, the way the fruit's life force drifts towards its original world seems too deliberate. Could it be that this fruit is actually a bait to lure beings from the Star Sea to hunt?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">While everyone debated, Lu Yu Zhi, the moderator, did not stop them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, he closed his eyes in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only when the room became quiet again did Lu Yu Zhi continue, "From the memory of the Xuanhuang Lan Yu, we have ruled out the possibility of this being a trap. Even if there was a conspiracy involving the Ruomu fruit in ancient times, it is not something we need to worry about in the current Xuanhuang Realm. Although the Xuanhuang Realm survived the great calamity of the Star Sea, it has also undergone unimaginable changes."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The current Xuanhuang Realm is under the joint rule of the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Council..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yu Zhi introduced the relevant information about the Xuanhuang Realm in detail to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is not right. Why is this Xuanhuang Realm much larger than recorded in our Profound Immortal Boat's archives?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Preliminary judgment suggests that it should be the combined efforts of the Star Sea survivors to resist the suction of the Immortal Ruins. The so-called Xuanhuang Realm is more accurately called [Land of Survival for All Realms]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then, there must be hidden experts in the Xuanhuang Realm. It is definitely not just the publicly known Law Transmitter and the five Longevity Heavenly Venerates."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Defying the principles of heaven and earth to attain Longevity... It is indeed interesting. Being bound to the world can indeed grant longevity unattainable by ordinary cultivators. Even their strength can increase in tandem with the world's prosperity. It's a pity that once they are outside the world, their strength is greatly weakened. And when the world is destroyed, they can only perish together."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone seriously examined the information about the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, do not forget that the Xuanhuang Realm contains numerous Immortal Realm Gifted Artifacts. This Heaven's Profound Mirror of the Myriad Immortals Alliance is clearly one of them. Are there other Immortal Artifacts in the Myriad Immortals Alliance? If we were to launch an expedition, we must consider this factor. Believe everyone understands how powerful True Immortals are. Can we truly win so easily?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In my opinion, there's no need for fighting and killing. According to Lan Yu's memory, the resources of the Xuanhuang Realm are still quite abundant. Our Immortal Boat is, at most, equivalent to less than half a state of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. We could adopt a trading approach to obtain what we need."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, even if we cannot conquer the Xuanhuang Realm, exploring the so-called Immortal Ruins would be greatly beneficial. Such surging True Immortal power... perhaps there are complete [True Immortal Scripts] inside!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alas, I still advise everyone to be more cautious. While we covet the various resources of the Xuanhuang Realm, the Xuanhuang Realm also desperately wants to break free from the constraints of the Immortal Ruins. To us, the Profound Immortal Boat, aren't they also a piece of fat meat?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whether to embark on an expedition to Xuanhuang or not was definitely a matter that could completely change the fate of the Immortal Boat. It was difficult to make a decision in a short period. And due to historical reasons, no one present proposed sending a part of their forces to test the waters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter what, the Profound Immortal Boat had to advance and retreat together. It could no longer afford a second split.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The council decided to reconvene in thirty days to make a final decision.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After everyone dispersed, only nine cultivators remained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Four from the Immortal Severing Tower, three from the Immortal Pivot Institute, one from the Proving Dao Academy, and one from the Immortal Boat's Star Forging Workshop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, as a direct disciple, was not qualified to be among them and waited outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda lightly gestured with his finger, and a picture immediately appeared before everyone. A beam of sword light sliced through the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sixteen characters, shining brightly on the heavenly screen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beyond the Star Sea, beneath the high wall, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat drifted through tribulations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda spoke slowly, "What do you all think?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This communication method... [Boundless]?" Nangong Lie from the Proving Dao Academy looked solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Did the Immortal Boat have a traitor?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not necessarily, it could also be those who defected back then. Trying to provoke trouble? And then reap the benefits?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No matter what, in the face of absolute strength, any conspiracy and tricks are all in vain. The only thing to consider is whether it is worth it or not."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Several people discussed the future of the Profound Immortal Boat, each offering their own opinions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, outside the council space, Li Fan did not leave early, waiting for his master.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked down at the buildings scattered throughout the Immortal Boat's divine tree, his thoughts focused on the Fruit of the Ruomu that had appeared in the council.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The life force of the Fruit of the Ruomu does indeed dissipate and drift towards the Xuanhuang Realm. But it's not through ordinary means; it involves the very fabric of the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is impossible to pinpoint the location of the Xuanhuang Realm through its life force alone."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They are lying. They must be using another method."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's mind raced through several possibilities, but he lacked the access to the true core of the Immortal Boat's highest levels to pinpoint the correct answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as he was pondering, a transmission interrupted his thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Zhao, hurry over!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a message from Wang Hai, his fellow disciple under Ai Tianjue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under normal circumstances, Wang Hai would rarely seek out Li Fan proactively. This urgent message indicated a matter of great importance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan no longer waited for Ai Tianjue and directly returned to Wang Hai's residence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Zhao, take a look at this."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This report from the Immortal Boat actually contains such a major flaw."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai had not attended this meeting, but he had already obtained the Xuanhuang report compiled by several factions of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes and looked. Wang Hai held a jade slip emitting an ancient aura.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the content recorded in the jade slip surprised Li Fan immensely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"...Thus, the Profound Immortal Boat has reached a critical juncture in its survival. To solve the problem of survival for the cultivators of the Immortal Boat at that time, the only remaining Immortal Artifact on the Immortal Boat was finally used."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"[Seed of Life Creation]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As a seemingly unremarkable black seed was planted, a divine tree took root and sprouted on the shattered body of the Immortal Boat."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It was precisely with the reinforcement of the divine tree that the fractured Immortal Boat was gradually stabilized."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As the saying goes, everything is destined. Who would have thought that this immortal artifact from the Xuanhuang Realm, which was once deemed worthless, would ultimately become the lifeline of the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the content of the jade slip, which was a record of the Immortal Boat's history after its split and his personal reflections.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Where did this come from?" Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Where did it come from? Of course, it's from my family's inheritance?" Wang Hai looked somewhat perplexed and answered righteously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As a child, I read all the collected jade slips in my family. Therefore, I have an impression of this section. The Immortal Boat's divine tree originated from the Xuanhuang Realm. This report states that the Immortal Boat has no Immortal Artifacts remaining..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Li Fan's somewhat strange expression, Wang Hai quickly explained: "I know there must be something fishy going on, so I haven't publicized it yet. That's why I asked you here."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I just wanted to test if pointing out this error would count towards the [Error Correction] merit. If not, then I take back what I said."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The so-called [Error Correction] merit was one of the most significant merits that cultivators of the Profound Immortal Boat could accumulate. During their cultivation and study, if they discovered and pointed out errors in the inherited texts of the Immortal Boat, or proposed opinions for improvement, they would receive extremely generous rewards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Over countless years, the Immortal Boat had not stagnated but had survived in the Star Sea through the wisdom of successive generations of cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan returned the jade slip and replied directly: "In my opinion, this is not an error, but rather the Immortal Boat deliberately concealing the connection between the Immortal Boat's divine tree and the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why? There's no need for that..." Wang Hai was astonished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then showed him the sixteen characters from Lan Yu's memory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ah, I remember now."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The reason why the Myriad Immortals Alliance dispatched a flying boat to the other side of the Star Sea was..." Wang Hai said thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then whispered: "This is the [Boundless] communication method, a secret technique of the Immortal Boat."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Hai was shocked and was about to say something more, but Li Fan stopped him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat's divine tree came from Xuanhuang, and Xuanhuang cultivators might still retain the method to control it. Is it possible that the divine tree saved the Immortal Boat, but we are going to conquer the cultivation world that sent us the divine tree? Is this not ungrateful?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the truth were revealed, it would inevitably cause many considerations among the upper echelons of the Immortal Boat. It would be more appropriate to conceal this matter, as many years have passed and few people are aware of the events of that year." Li Fan explained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, there might be spies from the Xuanhuang Realm within the Immortal Boat. If this secret were known to them, it would be extremely disadvantageous to our Immortal Boat." Wang Hai also recovered his senses and transmitted his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alas, it's a pity. I thought I had finally found another error," Wang Hai said somewhat dejectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You don't need to worry. The Star Sea anomaly is about to occur. As the residual True Immortal power in the Star Sea slowly becomes active, comprehending True Immortal scripts will become easier for us." Li Fan comforted him, his expression inscrutable.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-300" class="calibre1">Chapter 1289: Grand Wish Ascension Method</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But..." A hint of unwillingness flashed in Sun Tianci's eyes. "Isn't this harming others and benefiting oneself? I can achieve the same results by slowly cultivating, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not ridicule Sun Tianci's pedantry but slowly explained, "The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excess and replenishes the insufficient. The cultivation method I am imparting to you is in harmony with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, how could there be such divine efficacy?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Cultivators sacrifice the essence of heaven and earth to achieve Dao Integration. They are truly thieves of Heaven. Returning the treasure to its owner, is it good or evil?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If you look at it from the perspective of a cultivator, your actions are undoubtedly unforgivable and utterly evil; but if you look at it from the perspective of the Xuanhuang realm, you are an undeniable contributor to the world..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word was spoken with a deliberate cadence, as if implying some profound truth of heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Listening to Li Fan's words, the hesitation in Sun Tianci's eyes gradually turned to firmness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The content Li Fan had shown his avatar, Wu Ninglu, naturally contained truth mixed with falsehood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Sun Tianci's talent was outstanding, without guidance from a renowned master, how could he so easily convert the cultivation of other Dao Integration cultivators?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Born with Dao Integration, one is already superior to the vast majority of worldly cultivators. Furthermore, with my assistance..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stared at Sun Tianci, observing the faint, hidden aura condensing around him, and thought to himself, "Soon. Once his strength grows further and his connection with the Xuanhuang Realm deepens, I can let him venture to the Fallen Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan painstakingly nurtured Sun Tianci, not only because he viewed him as a chess piece to adjust the balance between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Sacred Dynasty in the future, but more importantly, to have him inherit the position of [Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When creating the Sacred Emperor's avatar, Li Fan had severed all memories related to the Fallen Immortal Realm and the trials for the Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, the Sacred Emperor had never had any intention of going to the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He had earned the Xuanhuang Realm's recognition entirely through his own practical actions that benefited the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the position of [Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate], besides requiring the Xuanhuang's acknowledgment, more crucially involved a succession ceremony.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a control mechanism implicitly passed down from the time Xuanhuang was first created, independent of the will of the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the inheritance had been severed for now, it remained deeply hidden in the depths of the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Becoming the true Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate not only allowed one to mobilize the power of the Xuanhuang Realm to the greatest extent but also held the possibility of inheriting the memories and legacies of past Great Heavenly Venerates.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The so-called "casting a stone to ask for directions."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was not interested in becoming the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, but he was very keen on the secrets of the Xuanhuang Realm and potential surviving Immortal Artifacts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In his sea of consciousness, the final trial scene he experienced in the Fallen Immortal Realm reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Detonating nine Immortal Artifacts, and extracting the colossal immortal spiritual power. World-ending power, enough to cross the high walls."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Four Immortal Artifacts, including the [Great Sun Golden Bell], still remain. These are indeed [Immortal Artifacts] passed down from ancient times."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having glimpsed three parts of the [Primordial Profound Spirit Grand Formation] and successfully recreating some of its power, Li Fan was acutely aware of just how formidable the power of a True Immortal was. If Immortal Formations were so powerful, Immortal Artifacts were no less.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These were ultimate trump cards capable of completely turning the tide of battle, even capital for him to explore beyond the High Walls in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mr. Bai might have been concerned about the safety of the Xuanhuang Realm and refrained from using the power of these Immortal Artifacts to confront the Dharma Transmitter. But I do not mind..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, the prerequisite is to gain the recognition of the Immortal Artifacts."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Artifacts left behind by the Great Heavenly Venerate should have some restrictions."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Various thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind. He looked again at Sun Tianci, who was engrossed in enlightenment from Li Fan's teachings, "There are less than three years left, which should be enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci's cultivation did not last long before it was interrupted by an unforeseen incident.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, a Sun family servant rushed in with a report.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The entrance to the Sun family has been blocked? And they're specifically challenging me?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Startled awake, Sun Tianci's expression was somewhat dazed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sun family servant replied with a crestfallen face: "Yes, young master. Those who tried to force their way out were all beaten up and thrown back. It's been happening for more than ten days. The family head is busy with urgent matters and cannot come. We had no choice but to disturb your cultivation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing the servant's terrified expression, Sun Tianci couldn't help but comfort him, "It's alright, bring me to see them."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For Sun Tianci, enlightenment and cultivation were as simple as eating and drinking. Being interrupted occasionally was acceptable, and he could resume it later. He naturally had no reason to be angry.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Arriving outside the Sun family's cave dwelling, Sun Tianci saw the person blocking the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a child of a similar age to himself, around five or six years old.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He wore purple clothes and had pure eyes... or perhaps, a somewhat simple-minded expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You... let's fight." The child pointed at Sun Tianci and said concisely.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci immediately shook his head: "No."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The child's eyes narrowed instantly upon hearing his request rejected.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci kindly reminded him: "You are only at the Nascent Soul stage, you will never be my opponent. I will not bully the small ones."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He spoke with genuine sincerity, and the killing intent emanating from the child in front of him gradually dissipated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci's ears, however, were filled with whispers from his family members: "Tianci, don't be careless. We've investigated. This little fellow is not simple. He's obsessed with martial arts and possesses terrifying strength. Although he's only at the Nascent Soul stage, he can defeat God Transformation cultivators with just his actions..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes, this person's origin is mysterious, and the Myriad Immortals Alliance seems to be ignoring him. People call him the [Martial Fanatic Child]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci nodded to his family, indicating he understood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, he looked at the Martial Fanatic Child and said seriously, "A Nascent Soul cultivator can defeat God Transformation, but the difference between God Transformation and Dao Integration is like a chasm. You have no chance of winning."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'm afraid I'll be too heavy-handed and hurt you."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Martial Fanatic Child shook his head, disagreeing with Sun Tianci's assessment: "Victory in battle has nothing to do with cultivation realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fight!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'm not afraid of death!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci looked at the burning fighting spirit in the child's eyes and felt a sense of helplessness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He knew that this battle was unavoidable, so he could only lead him to the Sun family's training ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the Sun family was a newly established aristocratic family, and their cave dwelling appeared ordinary on the outside, it truly possessed hidden wonders within. The various functional buildings of the cave dwelling were built no less impressively than those of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's ancient aristocratic families.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Take this training ground for example; it was built upon the corpse of an ancient fallen long-life cultivator, painstakingly collected. It could easily withstand the attacks of Dao Integration cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Inside the training ground, Sun Tianci and the Martial Fanatic Child, two children, stood facing each other, their expressions solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The onlookers were all incredibly tense.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci was currently the most precious existence in the Sun family. Although he had a crushing advantage in cultivation, if he were to sustain even the slightest injury, all the Sun family members present who failed to intervene would face severe punishment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Please!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Martial Fanatic Child let out a low shout. The next moment, a silver spear cut through the air and stopped precisely at Sun Tianci's forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"So fast!" Sun Tianci was somewhat surprised, but that was all.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The attack of a Nascent Soul cultivator couldn't even shake his defenses.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The spear dissolved like ice in water, vanishing on its own.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?" However, after neutralizing the opponent's offensive, Sun Tianci felt a surge of astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While he was momentarily stunned, the space before him rippled like water. Then, the silver spear leaped out like a flying fish from the sea and reappeared, thrusting directly at Sun Tianci's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Martial!" The Martial Fanatic Child simultaneously let out a powerful roar.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Silver light flowed all over the spear. In an instant, it split into seventeen other weapons, surrounding Sun Tianci in the center.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sabers, spears, swords, halberds, axes, battle-axes, hooks, forks...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if eighteen different cultivators were wielding them, simultaneously executing different moves.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They all slashed out in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci's body was completely engulfed by the violent silver explosion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Young master!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Tianci!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sun family members present cried out in alarm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If the training ground hadn't been sealed, they would have rushed in to rescue him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No need to panic, this level of power won't harm Tianci," Sun Luoyuan's voice rang out. The crowd immediately relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having heard that the Sun family's prodigy was sparring, Sun Luoyuan, who had arrived late, observed the battle in the training ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Martial Fanatic Child also understood that his attack would not be effective in a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the silver light engulfed Sun Tianci, he had already darted forward, launching relentless attacks.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There were weapons wielded by martial artists to injure people, magical treasures used by cultivators to manifest their forms, surprise hand-to-hand combat, and even the power of heavenly phenomena representing Dao Integration cultivators...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The training ground rumbled continuously, shaking incessantly. It appeared precariously close to shattering, its defenses seemingly capable of breaking at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luoyuan's expression was grave as he cast a spell to reinforce it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci, hailed as the greatest genius of the Myriad Immortals Alliance in a century, could only parry defensively, appearing quite battered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, everyone present could not comprehend Sun Tianci's shock at that moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because he discovered that the profound technique bestowed by his master, which could dissolve an opponent's attack and return it to heaven and earth, had actually lost its effect when facing the Martial Fanatic Child!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How can this be? Could it be that his cultivation realm is too low? The technique for dealing with Dao Integration cultivators is actually ineffective against him?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since birth, he had been cultivating. Although he had experienced numerous battles in his master's illusions and against Dao Integration cultivators of the Immortal Alliance, this was the first time his trump card had completely failed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young Sun Tianci couldn't help but feel a hint of panic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But he was extraordinary after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, although the Martial Fanatic Child's attacks were fierce, he was still two major realms behind Sun Tianci.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While enduring the barrage of blows, Sun Tianci gradually adapted to the opponent's attacks and began to discern some clues.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's not right! It's not that the technique has failed! Just like the Dao Integration cultivators before, the Martial Fanatic Child's moves, after being executed and neutralized by me, still cause his aura to decline for a short period. But..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The strength he loses is quickly replenished from heaven and earth?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Understanding this, Sun Tianci's shock deepened.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One must know that his technique wasn't simply about consuming spiritual energy. It was about stripping away the cultivator's origin and Dao foundation, then scattering them back to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, the Martial Fanatic Child's performance at this moment was equivalent to him continuously absorbing the origin power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao while fighting him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How is this possible?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Completely defying the new method created by the Heavenly Venerate?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">No wonder Sun Tianci was so shocked. The Martial Fanatic Child's actions were akin to him constantly devouring the Xuanhuang's innate essence, the origin of its birth, and the very spirit of heaven and earth...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao seemed to show no malice or retaliation whatsoever!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was something Sun Tianci's understanding deemed impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having discerned the secret, Sun Tianci, momentarily lost in thought, was seized by the Martial Fanatic Child, whose technique pierced through his defenses and directly struck him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Spitting out a mouthful of blood, Sun Tianci's eyes turned serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">White light, like flowing silk, appeared on his body, instantly repelling the Martial Fanatic Child's technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Sun Tianci's Heavenly Dao's essence, Bai Chou.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Bai Chou at this moment, after being trained by Li Fan and cultivated by Sun Tianci for several years, was qualitatively different from when it was first born.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To actually force me to this extent..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master said it well, there are countless geniuses in the world, and I am nothing special."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With white light swirling around him, Sun Tianci resolved the Martial Fanatic Child's attacks one by one.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Regardless of the reason, strike based on the method!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci's mind flashed with his master's teachings.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I can't figure out why this Martial Fanatic Child can continuously absorb the Xuanhuang's origin, then I won't bother!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Strike at the root, directly sever his connection with the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A bright light flashed in Sun Tianci's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusory white silk swirled like a tornado, rapidly spinning and enveloping Sun Tianci's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the vortex of white light, he floated into the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He pointed one finger at the sky and the other at the Martial Fanatic Child.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He softly uttered a command.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Martial Fanatic Child's originally fluid attacks were forced to pause slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he completely stopped his offensive, looking at Sun Tianci in the air with surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Two fingers, like a pair of scissors.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Temporarily severed his connection with heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">An unprecedented sense of weakness surged into his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And in Sun Tianci's eyes, the Martial Fanatic Child's figure seemed to blur the moment his connection was severed!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heavenly Dao's essence, born as a human?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A faint realization flashed in Sun Tianci's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His fingers did not stop moving.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using his method of communicating with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao to completely occupy the Heavenly Dao's perception of this space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Temporarily excluding the Martial Fanatic Child.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was destined to be unsustainable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Suppress!" Sun Tianci, suspended high in the sky, pressed down his finger pointing at the Martial Fanatic Child.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Infinite white silk light, like gushing rivers, converged within it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A colossal index finger phantom formed into a tangible entity, like a sky-piercing mountain, pressing down from above.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The space around the Martial Fanatic Child was sealed by this immense power, rendering him unable to move.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the suppressing finger descended, intense roars accompanied the whistling sound of space being crushed into cracks, echoing throughout the entire training ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci's expression was neither joyful nor sorrowful.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Martial Fanatic Child beneath the suppressing finger, also maintained a look of contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His eyes showed no fear, but rather a thoughtful expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the suppressing finger was about to crush him, he surprisingly imitated Sun Tianci's action and pointed a finger upward toward the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The purple garment on his body transformed into vast purple energy, surging into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the suppressing finger displayed by Sun Tianci, the momentum was much smaller, yet it seemed more condensed and sacred.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Martial Fanatic Child's face held expressions of enlightenment akin to joy and the solemnity of executing a profound technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One purple, one white; one rising from the earth, one descending from the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They collided violently near the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Blinding light instantly engulfed everything.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not good!" Sun Luoyuan's expression changed drastically. With a decisive wave of his sleeve, he enveloped the Sun family members who were watching and teleported away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, he did not forget to activate the protective formations around the training ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luoyuan's choice proved to be wise. The impact of the collision of the suppressing fingers engulfed the entire training ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And then continued to spread outwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sun family's meticulously arranged protective formations were like paper in the face of this terrifying power, shattering one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The immense force swept through, eventually engulfing half of the Sun family's cave dwelling.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two Dao Integration cultivators of the Sun family simultaneously cast spells, finally halting the aftermath.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the devastated Sun family cave dwelling, Sun Luoyuan's facial muscles twitched.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, Sun Tianci's powerful aura reassured him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After the chaos subsided, he arrived at the location of the former training ground, which was now a mere expanse of void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He saw that the Martial Fanatic Child had already disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci, the Sun family's prodigy, stood motionless, as if meditating and comprehending something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Strictly ordering everyone not to disturb him, Sun Luoyuan personally guarded him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the ruins surrounding him, Sun Luoyuan suddenly felt a sense of powerlessness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Both of us are in the Dao Integration realm, yet the difference in power is so vast."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even more terrifying is that Tianci is only five years old. In the future..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A word that he had never considered before suddenly appeared in Sun Luoyuan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang Realm, it's been how many years since a Longevity Heavenly Venerate has appeared?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Given Tianci's talent, it's not impossible, not impossible at all!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Especially with the great changes that are about to occur. With the convergence of winds and clouds, a chaotic world produces sages..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Luoyuan, a cultivator who had been in the Dao Integration realm for over five hundred years, found his hands trembling uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He could only close his eyes tightly, fearing that his thoughts would be perceived by others.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, within Sun Tianci's consciousness, the child cultivator was engulfed in self-reproach.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I didn't intend to kill him."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But the spell was cast, and he also counterattacked with the 'Suppress' technique..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I really couldn't control myself."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci was extremely frustrated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan's cold reprimand interrupted him: "Fool! How could an existence like that be easily killed by you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't worry. Even if your entire Sun family is wiped out, he won't disappear."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ignoring his master's harsh words, Sun Tianci, upon hearing that the Martial Fanatic Child had not perished, emerged from his remorse with some relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, who exactly is that Martial Fanatic Child?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is he a Heavenly Dao Essence born into human form?" Sun Tianci couldn't help but ask curiously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan let out a light snort: "You do have some insight."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan actually had more to say.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhang Qianmo's reincarnation method indeed has some merit."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The body created by destroying demonic beings and merging it with the basic laws of Xuanhuang."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And this body of the Martial Fanatic Child..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In Li Fan's previous reincarnations, although he had encountered the Martial Fanatic Child, he lacked the vision to comprehend the profound mysteries behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, with the significant gains from this life, his connection with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao becoming increasingly intimate, and even undergoing multiple rounds of enlightenment in the Star Sea, he now possessed the ability to discern the true nature of Zhang Qianmo's reincarnation body.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhang Qianmo made three great vows. First, to exterminate all demons in the world; second, to replace the Ten Great Immortal Sects; and third, to collect all cultivation techniques and share them with all cultivators in the world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To exterminate demons completely can be called [Annihilation]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the world of cultivation, the strong are respected. Replacing the Ten Great Immortal Sects can be called [Martial]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To share cultivation techniques so that all people in the world can cultivate, can be called [Literary]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ancient sages achieved enlightenment and transformed the world, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight, benefiting future generations. This is an ancient, supreme method capable of achieving True Immortalhood..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A sharp glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if the hope of completing each vow is extremely slim, the reincarnated body can, like my simulations, infinitely amplify the probability of success."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the immortal path still existed, Zhang Qianmo might truly have achieved True Immortalhood through this method."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's a pity..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head slightly: "Time flows, the immortal path is severed, and the world faces imminent destruction. This method..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not the fault of the method, but the change in the Great Dao!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The techniques that could achieve True Immortalhood in the past can now at most only allow one to prance around in a single realm." Li Fan seemed to have a sudden realization.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But compared to the cultivators who have long since turned to dust in the same era, Zhang Qianmo's method is still far superior. Even if, in the future, the Xuanhuang Realm can survive and the immortal path is reopened..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhang Qianmo might indeed have a chance to ascend to the True Immortal realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan couldn't help but fantasize about the future: "The process might be a bit long, but if one can achieve True Immortalhood, it will all be worth it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After pondering for a moment, Li Fan's thoughts returned to the present: "The Xuanhuang Realm has become the last sanctuary in the entire Star Sea. Zhang Qianmo's method of 'Great Vow to Ascend' can only achieve its second step; it's already quite difficult. If it weren't for Emperor Yi actively leading the other leaders away, he would have spent thousands of years on this step."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And now, this second step..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan watched the battle between Zhang Qianmo's reincarnated body and Sun Tianci from beginning to end.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He naturally saw the scene where the Martial Fanatic Child was born as if he were the essence of heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This method of 'Great Vow to Ascend' truly relies on the feedback power from the world's sublimation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By lodging oneself within the world, it is the complete opposite of the Heavenly Venerate's new method."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It can also be seen as a parasitic method. The new method only knows how to devour and plunder, while this 'Great Vow to Ascend' method benefits the world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No wonder the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao is willing to support him unconditionally. After all, in this world, who else is willing to stand on the side of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao? There are simply too few."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The method is indeed marvelous, but without the prospect of ascension, it is ultimately not worth mentioning."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At the very least, it's far inferior to directly achieving [Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan's thoughts churned, Sun Tianci, who had been relieved to learn that the Martial Fanatic Child had not died, began to sort out the gains from this battle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the first time he had encountered an opponent of similar age and fought on equal footing. He couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I didn't expect Master's 'Suppress' technique to be so powerful."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I've only grasped less than a third of it. If I were to fully unleash it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci traced shapes in the void, immersed in the profound and unfathomable rune patterns.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This 'Suppress' technique was, naturally, not a true [True Immortal Script].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was merely a remnant character that Li Fan had comprehended himself through his research on the Profound Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even this imperfect existence was still unimaginably terrifying for cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the saying goes, "Using stones from other mountains to attack jade." Li Fan had taught Sun Tianci the partially comprehended [Suppress Character Technique] precisely to see what this Xuanhuang prodigy could comprehend from it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He could then use it as a reference.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Sun Luoyuan had ordered that the details of the battle between the Martial Fanatic Child and Sun Tianci be kept confidential, the devastated state of the Sun family cave dwelling after the battle could not be hidden from the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, the reputation of the Sun family's prodigy grew even more prominent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even some battle-thirsty Dao Integration cultivators began to proactively seek him out for sparring matches.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci, however, welcomed them all, accepting every challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Through continuous battles, his combat ability rapidly improved.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And after cumulatively transferring a portion of the Heavenly Dao essence from thirty Dao Integration cultivators back to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, the accumulated power surpassed that of a complete Dao Integration cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Quantity finally led to a qualitative change.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, Sun Tianci stood stunned, gazing up at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Tears even welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He murmured softly, his expression filled with grief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A gust of wind seemed to sweep across his body, swirling incessantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A familiar aura descended upon Sun Tianci's body, unheard and unseen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Finally met the conditions?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With the Sacred Emperor as a supporter, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's requirements have become much higher."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Compared to the past, when simply slaughtering a few new method cultivators could achieve similar results."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan mused inwardly while observing from the side.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it is not yet time for him to undergo the trial of the Great Heavenly Venerate."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan keenly sensed that the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's attention towards Sun Tianci was different from that towards the Sacred Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps because Li Fan was hidden within Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, while showing affection, also exhibited a degree of vigilance and suspicion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This emotion was minuscule, and Sun Tianci himself did not notice it, remaining immersed in the supreme joy of connecting with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only Li Fan, who had personally experienced the Heavenly Dao's true closeness through the Sacred Emperor's body, could perceive this difference.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I still need to do more..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thinking carefully, perhaps only that matter would be the most efficient."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not feel annoyed by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's reaction, but instead began to ponder countermeasures.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To take, one must first give."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let me let you taste some sweetness first."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan coldly snorted inwardly, waiting for Sun Tianci to awaken from his enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ultimately, three days later, Sun Tianci reported his triumphant news to Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan's words left him somewhat astonished: "Master, aren't we going to spar with other Dao Integration cultivators anymore?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I feel it's very effective."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Too slow! Too slow! Master, I could be scattered into ashes at any moment, I can't wait that long."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan snorted coldly and directly infused the information into Sun Tianci's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci's eyes widened: "Master, this is a major crime in the Myriad Immortals Alliance!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I myself would be fine, but if it implicates the family..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After understanding his master's plan, Sun Tianci couldn't help but hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because his master wanted him to go to the Myriad Immortals Alliance's [Eternal Immortal Wall] and release the power originally belonging to the Xuanhuang Realm from the cultivators imprisoned there for eternity.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-301" class="calibre1">Chapter 1290: The Holy Emperor Suddenly Realizes</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Master, does the Myriad Immortals Alliance really possess the [Eternal Immortal Wall]? It sounds too outrageous.” After a long while, Sun Tianci still found it hard to believe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The Myriad Immortals Alliance’s atrocities are far more than just that.” Li Fan sneered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan’s initial knowledge of the Eternal Immortal Wall came from the 114th life, Xuan Tian Lock Spirit, and the Xuan net enveloping Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had initially thought it was a product unique to the Immortal Alliance of that era.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But later, in the 119th life, he impersonated Sun Xingwang, the Dharma King of the Xuan Heaven Sect, and using the Three Calamities and Hundred Tribulations Divine Bright Method, he refined countless imprints of demonic gods within the bodies of tens of thousands of cultivators. The method the Myriad Immortals Alliance ultimately used to deal with these cultivators was similar to the [Eternal Immortal Wall]. From the information revealed by Mo Ru Bin after he possessed the Law Transmitter, the Myriad Immortals Alliance did indeed secretly seal away many cultivators to maintain the stability of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And it was not located in just one place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Transmitting a blurry image to Sun Tianci, the young prodigy of the Sun family was instantly shocked by the brutal scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Master, what should we do?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, he woke up from his shock, his tone firm as he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Your [Profound Nether Art] is still too slow. Even if we successfully infiltrate the Immortal Wall, we won’t have much time to act.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Get faster first!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Profound Nether Art, naturally, was the wondrous method secretly passed down by Li Fan, which dissolved a cultivator’s cultivation and returned it to the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan’s clone flew out of Sun Tianci’s sea of consciousness and manifested a phantom form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan’s clone looked up at the sky and slowly whispered, “To corrupt the Heaven and Earth Essence…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he softly chanted, a scene that made Sun Tianci’s scalp tingle occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An invisible vortex instantly appeared above Li Fan’s head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A familiar aura, that of the Heaven and Earth Essence, seemed to be brewing within the vortex.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the blurry humanoid figure gradually emerging from it, Sun Tianci became even more certain of his guess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Summoning the Heaven and Earth Essence with a single word? Master’s true identity is…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Sun Tianci was somewhat stunned by the scene before him, Li Fan’s reprimand sounded in his ears: “Why are you still standing there? Do you really want the Heaven and Earth Essence to descend?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci immediately came to his senses and launched a Profound Nether Art directly at the blurry figure about to form in the vortex.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if the descent process was being obstructed. A gust of wind blew, and the Heaven and Earth Essence, summoned by Li Fan’s corruption, returned to the heavens and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During this process, Sun Tianci did not feel that his connection with the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth had deepened. Clearly, it was because the Heaven and Earth Essence still belonged to the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth and had not been refined and occupied by a cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And because the “Heaven and Earth Essence’s erroneous descent” was interrupted just as it was about to be achieved, the vigilance from the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth was minimal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes and sensed it, then cast another [Corrupt Heaven and Earth Doctrine].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci’s reaction this time was quick. The blurry figure had just taken shape when it was sent back again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They repeated this process over a hundred times until it was about to alert the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth to Li Fan’s presence, only then did he stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci breathed a sigh of relief, wiping sweat from his pale forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Clearly, continuously casting the Profound Nether Art for a long time, “decomposing” over a hundred Heaven and Earth Essences, even if they were only half-formed, was a considerable burden for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s move to another location and continue,” Li Fan said coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the day he defeated the Martial Fanatic Child and displayed his true combat power, Sun Tianci was no longer restricted by the Sun family. Even though he was actually only a little over five years old.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Sun Luoyuan constantly admonished him to prioritize safety. He also bestowed upon him numerous magical treasures for self-defense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The special training lasted for fifteen days, covering all corners of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Apart from travel time, the remaining time was almost entirely spent on dissolving the Heaven and Earth Essence. And Sun Tianci’s progress was astonishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a casual gesture, he could continuously return the corrupted, half-descended Heaven and Earth Essence back to heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, that’s about enough.” Li Fan nodded slightly, observing Sun Tianci’s performance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What are you thinking about?” Li Fan asked again, seeing Sun Tianci seem to fall into contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uh, Master, ten days ago, we came to this place before. The spiritual energy concentration seemed lower than it is now?” Sun Tianci asked uncertainly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled: “The spiritual energy in the world ebbs and flows like the tide, sometimes receding, sometimes rising, how can it be abnormal? How could it be like your cave dwelling where you’ve lived since childhood, always unchanging?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci nodded upon hearing Li Fan’s explanation. But deep in his eyes as he surveyed his surroundings, a trace of doubt flashed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This little fellow has such keen observation skills.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan naturally also sensed the abnormality in the world. He even detected a familiar aura from the pervasive spiritual energy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Dao Yi Bug. It seems to be the work of the Saint Emperor’s clone. The source should be from the [Five Elements Great Cavern-world]. Is it to return the cavern-world to the Xuanhuang Realm, thereby creating a combat environment suitable for the Great Qi soldiers? Perhaps it can also use the bug transformation of spiritual energy to launch a fatal blow…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The arrangements made by the Saint Emperor’s clone were almost all derived from the exploration of the main body in past lives. It was natural that after a moment of thought, he saw through the mystery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan did not expose it, merely pretending to be ignorant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning to Sun Tianci’s sea of consciousness, they headed towards one of the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s [Eternal Immortal Walls].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tongyan Prefecture, within a cave hidden among surrounded mountains and cliffs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This place…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci looked from afar, sensing something extraordinary: “If it weren’t for Master’s guidance, even if I had seen this cave earlier, I would have subconsciously ignored it. I wouldn’t have even been prompted to enter and investigate…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmph, this is said to be a blessed land that only those with fate can enter. The unique creations of Xuanhuang, without the need for formation concealment, can almost block the prying eyes of most people. The Myriad Immortals Alliance has hidden quite a few such hidden cave-heavens. They are almost all divided up by those Law Transmitters and used as their own residences.” Li Fan’s mind flashed back to the 119th life, the hidden cave-heaven he encountered when he infiltrated the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters with Mo Ru Bin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was exactly the same as this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because of its natural characteristics, the stationed cultivators will certainly not be highly vigilant. But we must still act cautiously…” Li Fan set up a series of formations around Sun Tianci’s clone, and then the two flew into the cave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After passing through a narrow, downward passage, they arrived before a deep cave, only as wide as a person’s waist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pitch black, it went straight down, seemingly bottomless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t use your divine sense to probe, it will trigger the alert.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, however, saw the mechanism of this underground cave at a glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Leaping into the deep cave, they sped downwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took a full hour, as if they had penetrated the Xuanhuang Realm and arrived at the depths of the Nine Netherworlds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After passing through a horizontal passage, a massive underground cave, shaped like an inverted cone, finally appeared before Sun Tianci.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cave walls were densely packed with square openings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon closer inspection, these openings were filled with amber-colored crystals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And inside these crystals, without exception, a cultivator slumbered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One could occasionally see Immortal Alliance guards patrolling in mid-air. Sun Tianci did not dare to release his divine sense to probe, but he roughly estimated that this underground cave contained at least over a hundred thousand cultivators sealed and imprisoned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their complexions were ruddy, and their faces even showed smiles, completely unaware that they were falling into eternal slumber.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“According to Master, this is only a part of the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s [Eternal Immortal Wall]…” Sun Tianci felt a shudder of coldness, instinctively clenching his fists.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Go, the rest is up to you.” Li Fan seemed to sense the repressed anger in Sun Tianci’s heart and said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, he transmitted the method for breaking the formation sealing these cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Master, what do you think would happen if we woke up all the cultivators here?” Sun Tianci suddenly asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I strongly advise you to abandon this idea. Since the Myriad Immortals Alliance dares to do this so openly, they must have made preparations. Believe me, you will never be able to wake them up as fast as the Myriad Immortals Alliance can deal with them. You must know that the Myriad Immortals Alliance possesses the means to extract a cultivator’s Dao foundation and preserve it…” Li Fan said coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci’s eyes flickered, and he finally had to give up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Avoiding the patrolling cultivators, he flew rapidly past these slumbering, pitiable beings. A faint breeze stirred, dissolving the Dao foundation within their bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Without their cultivation, they won’t live long in their sleep… It’s equivalent to me killing them myself…” Sun Tianci’s body trembled as he fled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Killing? Or saving? Look at their current state, isn’t it worse than death? If they could perceive everything around them, they would beg you to end their suffering.” Li Fan appeased him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After another round of persuasion, Sun Tianci’s hesitant actions gradually became firm again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For more than five years, Li Fan had been cultivating Sun Tianci according to his ideal image of the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, although he was benevolent, he was not foolish. If he made a decision, he would become incredibly resolute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dissolving the Heaven and Earth Power formed by thousands of cultivators, Li Fan gathered it all together, condensing it into a bright pearl of light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the act of benevolent liberation was one-fifth complete, Li Fan said, “That’s about it. If we continue, Master also won’t be able to conceal this intense energy fluctuation.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci looked at the remaining cultivators with a hint of regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he still obeyed his Master’s orders and quietly flew towards the exit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Master, is something wrong?” As they reached the top of the massive cavern, Sun Tianci noticed his Master still gazing downwards at a certain spot, and couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s nothing. Just leave.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief silence, Li Fan responded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci no longer pressed, and flew upwards. After leaving the terrifying dungeon, Sun Tianci took the pearl containing the Dao foundations of numerous cultivators and crushed it lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless streams of light instantly erupted. In a trance, Sun Tianci seemed to see scenes of wondrous creations, Xuanhuang cavern-worlds, and the transformation of mountains and rivers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the sky, wind and clouds changed color. The sound of grinding, like a giant millstone crushing, echoed above the clouds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the entire Xuanhuang Realm, in an instant, trembled slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the amplitude was minuscule, Sun Tianci still sensed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The Myriad Immortals Alliance must have sent someone to investigate. Let’s go!” Li Fan said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without the need for a reminder, the moment Sun Tianci crushed the pearl, he had already flown away from the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, he was immersed in the rapidly increasing Xuanhuang Heavenly Favor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan, after ensuring that no one was tracking them, recalled the scene he had just seen in the underground cave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Several faces flashed before his eyes. Although he didn’t know their names, Li Fan was certain that he had seen them before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But not in the Myriad Immortals Alliance, but in…</p>
<p class="calibre2">The territory of the Five Elders Council.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Yan Fa Jue space, the sea of consciousness of the main body activated the Dao Transformation Stone, projecting the scenes he had seen in the 119th life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was during the 119th life when the Myriad Immortals Alliance used the Immortal Chosen Ones to unleash the power hidden within the Law Transmission Stone Statues, tying down the five Longevity Heavenly Venerates, and then launched a fierce attack on the Five Elders Council.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Five Elders Council, seemingly cornered, finally revealed their hidden methods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An ancient sect, long thought extinct, reappeared in the world. Worse, cultivators from the [Land of Eternal Bliss] fearlessly counterattacked, wielding strange magical artifacts in a desperate fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan compared the faces of several individuals who appeared during that subjugation battle with the sleeping cultivators he had just seen in the underground cave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It matched perfectly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is interesting.” Li Fan gazed towards the location of the Land of Eternal Bliss in the Five Elders Council.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It seems that this Land of Eternal Bliss doesn’t only contain cultivators from the Five Elders Council. I wonder if the emergence of the sleeping cultivators in the Land of Eternal Bliss is due to a cooperation agreement between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Council, or if it’s solely the work of the Eternal Heavenly Venerate capturing them.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If it’s the latter, then perhaps this Heavenly Venerate’s strength is even greater than I imagined.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan’s mind conjured the infant-like image of the Eternal Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He then recalled the Dharma Transmitter Zhou, whom he met during his infiltration of the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters in the 119th life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When he appeared in a modern city with neon lights and rainy nights, he had claimed to have copied it directly from his vacation in the Land of Eternal Bliss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s not impossible that the Myriad Immortals Alliance is cooperating with the Land of Eternal Bliss.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The Land of Eternal Bliss might not entirely represent the Five Elders Council. They only intervene when the Five Elders Council faces absolute crisis.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Dream Realm…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly had a question: “I wonder if these cultivators can still exist in the Dream Realm if they die in reality. If the Xuanhuang Realm is no more, can this Land of Eternal Bliss still exist?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his thoughts churned, Sun Tianci had also completely absorbed the gains from this encounter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Li Fan, an excellent strategist and planner, as his master, he was arguably the fastest person to accumulate Xuanhuang Heavenly Favor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His progress was even faster than that of the Saint Emperor’s clone back then.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was just a pity. perhaps because there was already a destined Saint Emperor who could communicate with the Heavenly Dao consciousness at any time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though he clearly felt the closeness of the Xuanhuang Heaven and Earth, Sun Tianci still couldn’t directly communicate with the Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he could feel the pervasive “convenience.”</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-302" class="calibre1">Sun Tianci immediately cast a spell, and with the omnipresent blessing of Heaven and Earth, its power indeed increased significantly.Chapter 1285</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The vortex in the sky was about to close. The Saint Emperor reached out and grasped the last beam of starlight shooting out from it. The nebulae swirled, shining brilliantly. After being refined in the Saint Emperor’s palm, it flowed like gentle water towards him. It transformed into a star-lit throne. The Saint Emperor sat upright and spoke slowly, his voice like thunder: “ Boundless Primordial Chaos, Infinite Innate; Yin and Yang separate, Five Elements flow; All things emerge, created by the Great One…” Every word was profoundly mysterious and difficult to understand. But under the Saint Emperor’s recitation, the living beings fortunate enough to hear it in this world faintly felt a sense of contemplation. The fleeting moment of enlightenment, just experienced under the starlight from above, became clear again under the Saint Emperor’s every word of the Great Dao’s resonant sound. “Dao follows Heaven and Earth, holding it in hand is to be Immortal; Freely roaming the Azure Void, commanding Creation; Eternal through ten thousand tribulations, energy nurturing the eight desolate lands…” Even those with mediocre aptitude and low cultivation, under the Saint Emperor’s voice, gained some understanding. The anger in their hearts only intensified. The enlightened populace listened as if drunk. Yin Shangren scratched his scalp. He felt as if the primal Dao foundation within his body was impatient to burst forth. “This is Master’s good fortune, and also your good fortune.” However, at this juncture, no one dared question the Great Saint Emperor’s decision. The Myriad Immortals Alliance controlled half of the Xuanhuang Realm’s territories, yet it could still be commanded as if an extension of their arm. This was precisely because of the Heaven-Probing Mirrors and the Law Transmission Altars spread across every state. And seizing the opportunity when everyone was distracted, they hastily left the cave dwelling. “During the three years of preparation, some methods can be implemented in advance.” The remaining disciples all nodded in agreement. Six disciples, lined up in order. Sun Luoyuan was speaking eloquently at a gathering when he suddenly sensed something and quickly interrupted his lengthy speech. “Is this what they call ‘one person ascending, the chickens and dogs ascend’? No, this is clearly sharing one’s own understanding selflessly, imparting it to others regardless of closeness. Hiss…” “The ‘Dark Needle Plan’ is finally going to be implemented? I’ve waited so long for this day.” A glint flashed in Sun Luoyuan’s eyes. He suppressed the excitement and a hint of fear for the future, concealed his aura, and hurried towards the agreed meeting point. As for those with exceptional aptitude like Sun Erlang and Ou Shangtian, their eyes shone brightly, and purple energy even began to swirl around them. “Master gives you three years to comprehend. Three years from today…” The Saint Emperor’s voice echoed in everyone’s minds. Most of them would need the rest of their lives to digest the Saint Emperor’s sermon. Xuanhuang Realm, Tianquan Prefecture. No matter which prefecture encountered a problem, support from all prefectures or even the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance could swiftly arrive. “Congratulations, Master, on your enlightenment!” Sun Erlang said with a bow. Therefore, to deal with the Myriad Immortals Alliance, destroying or interfering with this connection became the top priority. Everyone lowered their heads and complied. The so-called Dark Needle Plan was a sabotage plan targeting the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s Heaven-Probing Mirrors and their teleportation altars. The Saint Emperor’s gaze swept over the six disciples below: “Our Great Qi Sacred Dynasty will conquer the Myriad Immortals Alliance and reclaim the Xuanhuang Realm!” “Three years.” … The Saint Emperor’s sermon lasted for three days and three nights. The six disciples’ bodies trembled upon hearing this. But Sun Luoyuan had already made up his mind. Besides the reasons that led him to betray them before, a greater factor was the recent demise of Sun Luochang. Even if it was just a perfunctory comfort, it would suffice. They had long known that this battle was inevitable, but no one had expected it to come so soon! It was only when the Saint Emperor’s image dissipated that they remained immersed in it, completely oblivious. Sun Luoyuan had been waiting for the Myriad Immortals Alliance to give him an explanation. It was only when the essence of blood left in the underground blood pool suddenly dried up that Sun Luoyuan felt despair. “Before, Ou Shangtian said he could influence or even destroy the Heaven-Probing Mirrors in each prefecture. I don’t know how he did it. However, my informants in each prefecture are already prepared,” Sun Luoyuan pondered as he hurried along. Spiritual energy spontaneously flowed into his body, an image of achieving enlightenment on the spot. He knew that once the arrow was shot, there was no turning back. If he made a move this time, he would completely solidify his identity as a traitor to the Myriad Immortals Alliance. If discovered, there would be no chance of survival. These days, he had watched the Myriad Immortals Alliance continue to release rainbow light messages from beyond the realm, even showing images of Sun Luochang, who had already perished. And now, the Saint Emperor had returned to his throne to contemplate. When he was chosen to go beyond the Xuanhuang Realm, Sun Luoyuan still held a sliver of hope for Sun Luochang’s survival. But clearly, he had overthought. The various prefecture guardians at the Harmonious Dao stage and those so-called important officials of the Myriad Immortals Alliance were indeed like materials that could be discarded at will. They were abandoned without hesitation. “Myriad Immortals Alliance…” At this point, Sun Luoyuan had completely severed all hope he had for the Myriad Immortals Alliance. He had completely sided with the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty. “Regardless of anything else, the benefits I have received from the Sacred Dynasty in recent years far outweigh those from serving the Myriad Immortals Alliance.” Thinking this, Sun Luoyuan had already arrived at the agreed rendezvous point. Beside the towering white mist barrier in Tianquan Prefecture. Years ago, due to the great upheaval in the Xuanhuang Realm, the white mist barrier here had broken and crashed to the ground. The unconstrained Devouring Mist had flowed and spread outwards, mercilessly devouring all the living beings it enveloped. Although the great upheaval eventually subsided and the white mist barrier was restored, this dead land had never recovered its vitality. This attested to the terrifying nature of the Devouring Mist. “Who would have thought that the Sacred Dynasty actually had a way to almost completely negate the influence of this Devouring Mist. Meeting here is the safest!” Sun Luoyuan scanned his surroundings, ensuring no one was following, and cautiously took out the [Diligence True Boat]. Flying into the boat, he piloted it into the white mist barrier. Maintaining a constant speed and constantly changing direction, after traveling for a while, he indeed saw another Diligent True Boat quietly docked within the white mist. A black light flew out from it, lightly cutting through the white mist and arriving in front of Sun Luoyuan. Sun Luoyuan took it and found it was a storage ring made of black jade. When he looked up again, the previous Diligent True Boat had already vanished without a trace. “So cautious, they wouldn’t even show their face.” Inside the black jade ring, nearly a thousand square jade pieces, engraved with profound characters, were neatly arranged. Sun Luoyuan took one out and examined it carefully, while also reading the usage instructions just transmitted via the black light. “As long as it is brought into a Heaven-Probing Mirror or a teleportation altar, and activated, it can explode?” “So simple?” Sun Luoyuan was somewhat surprised. He immediately felt the urge to try it out. However, after studying it carefully, he could only shake his head in frustration. “The detonation time has already been set. It can only be detonated three years later. Before that time, even the core formation within is not activated, and it is just an ordinary jade piece…” “No wonder I couldn’t sense any spiritual fluctuations from it.” Sun Luoyuan put the jade piece back, his expression grim: “Let those cultivators, whom the Myriad Immortals Alliance considers ants, be the first to sound the death knell for it.” Just as the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty began to operate for the conquest plan three years later, Li Fan had already annihilated four small worlds through the Spirit Void Grand Array. He had collected enough of the substance he called [Essence of All Things]. A pure collection of energy, emitting a dreamlike, multicolored viscous glow. To Li Fan, it felt similar to the golden Origin Force Essence. “Have you learned this formation?” Li Fan gazed into the distance, asking the Boundless Mirror. The simulated personality, Sun Luoyao, who had been rebuilt several times, remained silent for a moment before finally replying, “I’ve more or less learned it, Senior.” Li Fan nodded with satisfaction. He gently flicked his finger, and a beam of light entered Sun Luoyao’s illusory form: “Then, for the next step, you will go to these places and continue setting up the formations.” “Just quietly set up the formations, no need to activate them.” Saying this, Li Fan flicked the Boundless Mirror, along with all the Origin Force Essence he had collected upon returning to the Sun family, towards it. Sun Luoyao quickly collected the golden light, thanked Li Fan excitedly, and then transformed into a beam of light, heading towards the target small world. If it were the real Sun Luoyao, executing Li Fan’s task alone might have led to insubordination. But now, he was merely a simulated personality. He might not even be genuinely happy to receive Origin Force Essence; it was all fabricated, so he naturally would not disobey Li Fan’s orders. “The Boundless Mirror Spirit setting up formations is less effective than me, but destroying a world is more than enough. After all, the small worlds I chose were all weak, with no cultivators, preventing outsiders from noticing them being approached by the Xuanhuang Realm’s Immortal Ruins.” “Although he may not show himself again in this life, leaving some contingency is still necessary.” The connection with the Saint Emperor had been completely severed. However, Li Fan could still faintly sense the tremendous changes happening to the Saint Emperor. “Did he have another epiphany in the Star Sea?” “Clearly, the clone’s original talent was just ordinary. With so many fortuitous encounters and blessings, he has truly begun to resemble a destined protagonist…” A hint of sarcasm flashed across Li Fan’s face. “It’s a pity, it’s all in vain!” Li Fan’s divine sense transformed into a thin thread and flew towards the Tianquan Prefecture region. He needed to deliver the [Essence of All Things] he had collected for protection to his main body. In just over half a day, Li Fan had found his target. The “Hermit Chi,” who had been cultivating in the mortal world in disguise. The clone, unnoticed, drifted into the body of a nearby Golden Core cultivator. The cultivator paused for a moment, then quickly returned to normal. Turning around, he arrived in front of Hermit Chi. “Elder, shall we play a game of chess?” The disheveled Taoist, who was picking his feet without any decorum, immediately looked up. ... After Li Fan successfully obtained the Law Transmitting Jade Token from Hermit Chi, he first went to the Debating Dao Tower in Tianquan Prefecture and used all his savings to rent a small courtyard. Then, using the [Dao Pill] method, he completely possessed the body of the host cultivator. Li Fan extended his hand, looking at his new body, and frowned slightly. “Compared to the environment of the Xuanxianzhou outside the Star Sea, this soul-possessing method is not as perfect in the Xuanhuang Realm.” Li Fan moved his limbs and felt a slight discordance. “Possessing Zhao Xian could deceive the Immortal Severing Tower.” “But possessing this…” “Fu Yuansheng, might not be able to evade the inspection of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.” Li Fan manipulated Fu Yuansheng’s body and set up a formation around himself. Then, he strode into the formation. “Using the body as the tool, refining with the formation~” Li Fan chanted softly, using the power of the formation to gradually refine and eliminate the disharmony within the possessed body. During this process, the experiences of the Saint Emperor’s cultivation in this life, the sights of the Saint Embryo within the Xuanxianzhou, and the insights gained from the main body’s seclusion and enlightenment, all flooded his mind and were integrated by Li Fan. He tapped his fingers, modifying and improving the formation he had just set up. The abnormalities of the body and soul gradually disappeared. “From today onwards, I am Fu Yuansheng!” Li Fan’s divine sense smiled slightly. To verify, Li Fan first entered the Heaven-Probing Mirror of Tianquan Prefecture. As expected, he successfully deceived the Heaven-Probing Mirror’s inspection and entered his Heaven-Probing Mirror space as Fu Yuansheng. “Two thousand contribution points…” “Truly meager.” Li Fan shook his head and sighed, but made no changes. He merely rested for a while as usual before leaving the Heaven-Probing Mirror. He then walked to the most prosperous area of Tianquan Celestial City and activated the Law Transmitting Jade Token. The sudden burst of light immediately attracted the attention of everyone present. “What is that?” “This type of jade token… Hiss, could it be that?” Soon, someone recognized the item in Li Fan’s hand, and exclamations of shock and disbelief arose. The surrounding cultivators surrounded Li Fan, who put on an appearance of extreme pallor and forced support. As the recruiting cultivator arrived, stabilizing the chaotic scene, the recruiting cultivator weighed the jade token in his hand and did not directly take Li Fan to the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters. Instead, he transmitted a voice: “This Law Transmitting Jade Token is of exceptional quality, capable of deriving Harmonious Dao cultivation techniques… You are only at the Golden Core stage, which is a waste. Are you interested in transferring this jade token to me? Of course, I will not mistreat you. I will still grant you a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique, and even prepare all the resources needed for your promotion from Nascent Soul to Harmonious Dao.” “Thank you for your kind intentions, Senior…” Li Fan cupped his fists, “But I am not interested in transferring the jade token.” The recruiting cultivator, who thought Li Fan would agree, changed his expression upon hearing the reply: “Boy, you should think clearly! It’s not that having a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique guarantees you can reach Harmonious Dao. I’ve already investigated your background. Without family support, I doubt you can even reach Nascent Soul on your own!” “I am doing this for your own good!” The recruiting cultivator stared intently at Li Fan. Li Fan was slightly surprised: “Did Senior not hear clearly? Then I will say it again.” “Junior is not interested in transferring the Law Transmitting Jade Token.” This time, it was not a voice transmission but a clear declaration in public. The surrounding cultivators immediately turned their attention to the recruiting cultivator. Although no one dared to openly discuss, their gazes clearly conveyed their thoughts. The recruiting cultivator, having a deep understanding of worldly affairs, showed no change in his expression: “Since that is the case, so be it. I was merely offering friendly advice. With a Golden Core cultivator possessing a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique… I don’t know how many malicious individuals would be tempted to take risks.” “Isn’t that right, Fu Yuansheng!” he said loudly, also vocally. The voice shook, faintly spreading throughout Tianquan Celestial City. Instantly, all eyes in the city converged on Li Fan. Their expressions varied, but all concealed greed. Li Fan’s face turned completely pale, a hint of hatred and fear flashed in his eyes, and he bowed his head, saying, “Thank you for your concern, Senior.” The recruiting cultivator let out a cold snort and then opened the passage to the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters. After the two of them left, the previously suppressed Tianquan Celestial City erupted into a frenzy. Golden Core cultivators, Harmonious Dao cultivation techniques. The combination of these two was too impactful, instantly becoming the focus of everyone’s discussion. Fu Yuansheng’s background information was also quickly dug up. Those with quick minds began to instruct people to pressure the Fu family. Powerless and with low cultivation, even if he obtained a treasure, how could he protect it? In the Debating Dao Tower of Tianquan Celestial City. A cultivator in white robes looked at this scene and sighed slightly: “This recruiting cultivator is truly pushing people to a dead end!” A handsome young man opposite him also nodded in agreement: “Unless Fu Yuansheng can hide in the Heaven-Probing Mirror forever and ignore the lives and deaths of his family and friends, I’m afraid he cannot protect that Harmonious Dao cultivation technique.” The young man paused, then changed the subject: “It’s just a Harmonious Dao cultivation technique, yet they resort to such life-or-death tactics. And this is happening in broad daylight, in the eyes of everyone… We came out for a cup of tea and encountered such a thing. It just goes to show how many similar incidents are happening offstage.” “The Immortal Alliance is corrupt, as can be seen.” The white-robed cultivator remained silent, sighing helplessly after a long while. “That’s why I say, joining our Sacred Dynasty and overthrowing the corrupt rule of the Immortal Alliance is the wise choice. Tianming, you’ve been to our Sacred Dynasty before, and such forceful coercion would never happen in the Sacred Dynasty.” The young man transmitted his voice, speaking eloquently. The white-robed cultivator, named Tianming, also nodded in agreement: “Brother Tianci, you are right. In that fishing pond, countless treasures were fished out, and they all belonged to the citizens of Da Qi personally. There’s no need to worry about anyone snatching them… Judging by this alone, the Sacred Dynasty is already far superior to the Immortal Alliance!” Shang Tianci smiled: “I see that Brother Tianming has made up his mind.” The white-robed cultivator also responded with a smile. “Another one successfully persuaded. This time is truly a blessing from heaven.” Shang Tianci secretly thought, and at the same time, the next name flashed in his mind. “I wonder about the progress of the others.” In the absence of the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s awareness, such changes were constantly occurring everywhere. When people’s hearts are lost, it is only a matter of time before they are persuaded or swayed. At the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. When Fu Yuansheng’s body, Li Fan, arrived at the headquarters again. As expected, just like the previous few times, Li Fan fell into an illusion. The illusion master was still the Law Transmitting Heavenly Venerate. However, the scenes witnessed this time were completely different from before. Below the continuous immortal mountains shrouded in clouds and mist, a man in his fifties was being ruthlessly stopped. “This is an immortal sacred place, how can you, a mere mortal, trespass?” “Strange, weren’t there illusion formations set up outside? How did this mortal get in?” A cultivator in blue Taoist robes muttered, kicking the middle-aged man away. The middle-aged man tumbled awkwardly on the ground, then miraculously got up as if unharmed, saying with a smile, “Immortal Master, can you give me a chance? I feel… I feel like I can cultivate.” The cultivator sneered, “You’re already half dead, and you still dream of cultivating? Cultivation requires talent and resources. Someone like you…” The cultivator’s face was filled with contempt: “Even if you could cultivate, our Tianyuan Sect doesn’t accept you!” The middle-aged man didn’t give up, even extending his arm, offering it: “Immortal Master, believe me, look, my aptitude…” The cultivator’s eyes flashed with killing intent, his spiritual energy surging, about to blast this ignorant fool to death. Just then, a familiar voice echoed from above: “What’s your name?” “Xuanyuan Dog Egg… No, Xuanyuan Tuo, my name is Xuanyuan Tuo,” the middle-aged Law Transmitter said somewhat nervously. “Uncle Xu!” The cultivator’s expression changed, and he immediately retracted his killing intent, hastily bowing to the newcomer. He was also a middle-aged man, but this Uncle Xu looked much more energetic than Xuanyuan Tuo. He came to Xuanyuan Tuo’s side and examined him closely. After a moment, Uncle Xu shook his head with a hint of regret: “Although your willpower is sufficient for cultivation, your age is simply too great. It will be extremely difficult to achieve anything.” “It will probably be incredibly difficult to even reach the Foundation Establishment stage…” Xuanyuan Tuo quickly said, “Immortal Master, I don’t have high demands. As long as I can cultivate. I’ve been farming for most of my life, and my heart has always been restless, feeling that I shouldn’t spend my life in the fields…” Uncle Xu was somewhat surprised. He hadn’t expected this old farmer to say such words. As he hesitated, a clear bell sound echoed from the mountain peak in the distance. The blue-robed cultivator behind him also reminded him: “Uncle Master, the Sect Master is convening a meeting.” Uncle Xu looked back at the mountain peak, swallowed the words he was about to say, and took out a book. “Go back and read this scripture first. If you can cultivate spiritual energy within a year, then come find me again.” Saying that, Uncle Xu floated away. Xuanyuan Tuo’s eyes widened as he watched. “Xiao Qin, don’t make things difficult for him.” Before leaving, Uncle Xu specifically instructed. The blue-robed cultivator nodded. He looked at Xuanyuan Tuo and snorted coldly: “What a fool’s luck!” “Hurry up! Come back when you’ve actually cultivated spiritual energy!” Seeing this, Xuanyuan Tuo had no</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The intention conveyed by the Xuán Huáng Heavenly Dao was not entirely clear, but Saint Emperor Li Ping had already grasped its meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The position of Great Heavenly Venerate..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Might lose the connection with me?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping frowned, unable to help but fall into contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's been thousands of years since a new Xuán Huáng Great Heavenly Venerate was appointed, and it's happening at this particular time... Who could it be?" The Saint Emperor smelled a conspiracy. The Saint Emperor could now only monitor a small part of the Xuán Huáng Realm; most areas were blind spots. Faces flashed rapidly in his mind, but he could not identify any suspicious individuals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although theoretically, anyone who passes the Great Heavenly Venerate trial should be on my side and face the Dharma Transmitter together, but..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor soothed the Xuán Huáng Heavenly Dao while his eyes revealed a resolute expression: "It seems the plan needs to be advanced."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We just need to force the Dharma Transmitter to appear when the Star Sea anomaly arrives."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A beam of starlight shot out from the Saint Emperor's throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Heavenly Court, a machine that had been preparing for battle for a long time, began to operate rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang, who was conducting the final test of the Sacred Army puppets' defensive capabilities, was somewhat surprised by the Saint Emperor's summons. However, looking at the endless array of puppets arranged in the test field, he quickly became excited and eager.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To raise troops for a thousand days and use them for a moment. It's time to let the decadent Myriad Immortals Alliance witness the elite army of the great Sacred Dynasty!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as he was about to leave to handle the departure mobilization tasks, Sun Erlang seemed to remember something and flashed to the deepest part of the test field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surging earth vein power was as dense as solidified material. It seemed to be constantly battered and squeezed by some immense force. The originally earthy yellow color now resembled molten magma, fiery red. The earth veins surged and roared, striking a black, stubborn rock at the center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how the red earth veins raged, the black rock stood unyieldable. In fact, with every impact of the red earth veins, the luster on the rock became brighter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Above the black rock, a beam of starlight shone down from the constantly rotating starry vortex, directly illuminating the rock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the starlight, the black rock seemed to breathe, inhaling and exhaling specks of starlight along with its continuous movement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong Jushi was observing this miraculous scene of the black rock in the sky not far away, continually manipulating the power ratio between the earth veins and starlight input.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Elder Qiao, the battle might start earlier. Senior Tianyang, he..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong seemed to have also received the summons. His eyes remained fixed on Tianyang's body, and he said nonchalantly: "Don't worry. By then, I will definitely give those scoundrels a big surprise. Those fellows swallowed quite a bit of my Origin Force in the past few years..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Right! Since the war is about to start, those people from the Tianling Sect can also be put to good use." Qiao Gong patted his head, then closed his eyes and reported to the Saint Emperor. After receiving the decree, he sent out another command, which floated far towards the puppets in Jiushan Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A hint of pride flashed in Qiao Gong's eyes. His attention returned to Tianyang, who was undergoing double tempering from the earth veins and the power of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong could clearly feel the immense power gestating within this black rock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His body trembled slightly, and Qiao Gong's eyes flashed with madness. "This puppet is the pinnacle of my refining artistry. Even in the former Tianji Realm, no one could surpass it. Shangguan, just watch. The disciple you ignored will surpass you by a wide margin..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong ignored Sun Erlang, who was still beside him, and muttered to himself. His hands continuously cast spells, floating above Tianyang's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang, seeing this, wisely retreated quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While the Great Qi army and its people were meticulously preparing for battle, two individuals within the Sacred Dynasty had already left the small world under the cover of complete relaxation and returned to the Xuán Huáng Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were Xu Ke and Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren squinted his eyes and looked up at the sky, seemingly unaccustomed to the sunlight of the Xuán Huáng Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke, on the other hand, was discerning the direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They needed to infiltrate the Museum of Natural Curiosities before the war began.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Speaking of Emperor Sansheng Mo, he's quite interesting. He's one of the Three Great Beast Emperors, yet he joined a human cultivation sect; and when disaster struck, he didn't hesitate to betray and join the New Myriad Immortals Alliance..." Yin Shangren said with a cold laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke shook his head and explained: "Grandfather Sansheng is mysterious, no one knows what he's thinking. After all, he didn't leave the Xuán Huáng Realm with Emperor Yi back then, which is already baffling. Moreover, his actions might not be considered betrayal of the Imperial Beast Sect. After all, the entire Imperial Beast Sect prospered mainly because of the techniques he brought. He benefited the Imperial Beast Sect, rather than the Imperial Beast Sect benefiting him."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I think joining the Myriad Immortals Alliance might still be for the sake of survival."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren sneered: "I don't care about anything else. If he dares to obstruct me when I retrieve Mr. Bai's skull, I won't be polite... As for you, you won't betray me, will you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke said solemnly: "Don't worry, Daoist friend. I've already made arrangements. Qing and Hong have gone to the Spiritual Void Realm. Mimicking the Imperial Beast Wheel reincarnation, coupled with the cooperation of the current Imperial Beast Sect, should be able to lure Grandfather Sansheng away. At worst, even if the plan fails..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I won't hold back."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's good." Yin Shangren, having received Xu Ke's guarantee, smiled and his expression returned to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two followed the plan and traveled stealthily, arriving near the Heavenly City of Tian Yu Prefecture, belonging to the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This should be it, the Heng family of Tian Yu Prefecture." Xu Ke observed his surroundings while looking left and right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In my opinion, just find any family with authority to enter the Museum of Natural Curiosities. Why did we have to travel so far to come here?" Yin Shangren scratched his scalp, sounding impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That was the original plan. But recently, the Saint Emperor suddenly sent a message saying that something seemed to have happened in the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and the access management to the Immortal Alliance headquarters has suddenly become stricter. This leaves very few cultivators who still have the authority to enter the Museum of Natural Curiosities. Among them, the Heng family of Tian Yu Prefecture is the most suitable target."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The family is prominent, entirely due to their skill in weaving fabric. Their strength is not particularly strong, and they tend to keep a low profile, having minimal public presence..." Xu Ke explained via telepathy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren's gaze penetrated the Heng family's defenses, revealing a cold smile: "The easiest targets should be those two little girls. They're even mother and daughter..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's right, it's them, Heng Ruoshui and He Xin Xin. As soon as they go out, we'll capture them and switch their identities."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Saint Emperor instructed that unless absolutely necessary, no harm should be done to them." Xu Ke added.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren: "Don't worry, these delicate skins are not to my taste. Besides, do we have to change into women? Can't we choose someone else?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke sneered: "Are you still concerned about appearances?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren waved his hand: "That's true. I can't be bothered to run anymore. Let's finish this quickly. I'm a bit eager to see Mr. Bai's skull."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Heng family mother and daughter did not make the two wait too long.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Two days later, He Xin Xin sneaked out to play and was silently captured by the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Two days later, Heng Ruoshui seemed to receive an invitation and left her cave dwelling. She was also captured by the two in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the bound and unconscious Heng family mother and daughter, Yin Shangren stroked his chin: "The technique passed down by the Saint Emperor is indeed extraordinary. This little girl's Void Compass within her body is indeed extraordinary. It has the ability to avoid good fortune and predict the future. It can be considered half of Heaven's Marvel, perhaps the rebirth of an ancient immortal artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, with the Saint Emperor's secret technique 【Covering the Heavens with One Hand】, this little girl is completely unaware of the impending crisis..." Xu Ke smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke and Yin Shangren exchanged glances, tacitly understanding each other. While visiting the Museum of Natural Curiosities, they slowly moved towards the central area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, they finally saw the skull placed quietly in the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke's body trembled slightly. He took a deep breath, and his mood slowly calmed down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren also exerted great effort to prevent any abnormalities from showing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They walked up to Mr. Bai's skull and gazed silently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can barely hold back my urge to act."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's wait. The Immortal Alliance and the Sacred Dynasty haven't started fighting yet. More importantly, I can vaguely sense that Grandfather Sansheng is still lurking in the museum. Anyway, with the Heng family's authority, they don't have time restrictions for visiting..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren did not reply, but had already become completely engrossed in observing Mr. Bai's skull.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After an unknown amount of time, another figure arrived near the skull.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After gazing for a long time, they let out a light sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This immediately attracted the attention of Xu Ke and Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The visitor was a middle-aged cultivator with a long beard. He looked at Mr. Bai's skull, like them, his emotions were somewhat uncontrollably stirred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So it's this kid..." Yin Shangren snorted coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Do you know him?" Xu Ke asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, his name is Shangguan Shiquan. He fought with me for Mr. Bai's rib back then. Speaking of which, Mr. Bai still has a leg bone with him..." Yin Shangren's tone was unfriendly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, after taking the most important skull, we'll collect the remaining parts one by one too." Xu Ke's eyes flashed with a dangerous glint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course." Yin Shangren agreed wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Grandpa, what's so interesting about this? I still want to see the ancient magical artifacts from before..." A slightly childish voice came from afar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a little girl, about three or four years old, who walked up to Shangguan Shiquan and tugged at him, crying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is one of the greatest cultivators in the history of the Xuán Huáng Realm." Shangguan Shiquan picked up the little girl and comforted her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The little girl's eyes widened with curiosity upon hearing this and stared intently at the skull before her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Shangguan Shiquan's words, Yin Shangren and Xu Ke's attitudes changed somewhat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of silence, the little girl suddenly exclaimed in surprise, pointing at Mr. Bai's skull: "Grandpa, look, there's someone there!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a thunderclap, it instantly exploded in the hearts of the three people present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three of them immediately refocused their gaze on the skull.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it was still quiet, and there was no sign of life at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shangguan Shiquan stroked the little girl's head: "Nannan, don't talk nonsense, where is someone!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The little girl pouted, her face full of displeasure: "Nannan isn't talking nonsense, there clearly is someone! It's inside the skull, can't you see it?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The little girl's words were too earnest, and Shangguan Shiquan couldn't help but hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He took another careful look.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He still found nothing. Then Shangguan Shiquan secretly laughed at himself. How many times had he looked at this skull? How could someone possibly be hiding inside?</p>
<p class="calibre2">He thought it was just childish prattle and urged the little girl not to make trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the little girl was insistent and continued to shout.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shangguan Shiquan reluctantly took the little girl and left the place for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Near the skull, only Yin Shangren and Xu Ke remained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke said solemnly: "What do you think?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was clearly asking about the little girl's words just now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Impossible. I am absolutely certain that Mr. Bai is completely dead. There is definitely no will left on this skull."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Besides, Di Sansheng Mo is no ordinary person; he wouldn't be unable to distinguish whether there's a residual will in the skull. If there were, how could he openly display it here for us to examine? Hmph, that's the remnant will of a Xuán Huáng Great Heavenly Venerate..." Yin Shangren replied decisively after a long silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But..." Xu Ke stared at Mr. Bai's skull, a trace of doubt in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Before the little girl mentioned it, I didn't notice it. But after she said it, I really feel like something is hidden inside this skull."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not Mr. Bai's remnant will, but something else..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When I was young, I liked playing hide-and-seek with my companions. As long as Mr. Bai was there, we all liked to hide next to him. He seemed to be able to contain the entire world; as long as you were close to him, it was hard for others to find you..." Xu Ke murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What he said made Yin Shangren start to waver.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, that receiving cultivator mentioned earlier that a remnant soul actually escaped from the Times. It disappeared afterwards..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps." Xu Ke suddenly spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Remnant soul from the Times?" Yin Shangren narrowed his eyes and stared at Mr. Bai's skull.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We've been here too long. Let's go somewhere else first." Without answering, he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After walking to the viewing area called 【Phases of All Beings】, Yin Shangren said: "Although Mr. Bai's remains look like ordinary mortal bones, they are, after all, the bones of a former Great Heavenly Venerate. They must have their uniqueness."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, this uniqueness is difficult to discern. I once fused and raised a mutated human-dog, which was extremely disgusted by any bones. Only my collected white rib bone did it show special affection for..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It was as if it was the existence that could save it from fire and water." Yin Shangren seemed to recall something and pondered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke's heart stirred and said: "So, perhaps Mr. Bai's skull can indeed protect that remnant soul. It's just that we haven't figured out the truth yet."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph. After all, there are layers of defenses from the Myriad Immortals Alliance, so we can't see clearly. Once we get the skull, we'll figure it out." Yin Shangren snorted coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke nodded in agreement, then suddenly said: "Speaking of which, even we couldn't detect the remnant soul hidden in the skull, yet that little girl noticed it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This little girl is not simple. What was her name again? Shangguan Nihongo? When we get back, we must report this matter to the Saint Emperor..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">If Li Fan were present and could hear their conversation, he would surely guess that the power that protected the remnant soul in Mr. Bai's skull was the 【Eternal Remnant Thought】 that was fatally attractive to 【Returning to Truth】.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This energy, unknown to Xuán Huáng cultivators at present, could only be absorbed and utilized by Returning to Truth, and it was the fundamental reason why he desperately sought Mr. Bai's skull.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, because the Saint Emperor had severed the connection with his main body in the Star Sea in this life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if Yin Shangren and Xu Ke conveyed their findings to the Saint Emperor, Li Fan was destined not to know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">While the two of them were visiting the Museum of Natural Curiosities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An unusual aura had gradually begun to spread across the Myriad Immortals Alliance's territory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Li Fan's spiritual sense had infiltrated the Great Earth Cave with Sun Tianci and stolen the Dao foundation of nearly one-fifth of the slumbering cultivators, the Immortal Alliance's higher-ups were furious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A large-scale investigation operation was secretly launched.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No reason was given, only that all cultivators who appeared in Tongyan Prefecture that day were thoroughly scrutinized.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Eternal Immortal Wall was destined to be shrouded in secrecy and could only be investigated privately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, opaque investigations inevitably led to widespread panic among the populace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rumors of the Myriad Immortals Alliance going to war with the Five Elders Council, fueled by Sacred Dynasty spies, became increasingly rampant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the situation became increasingly tense, further bad news came from Jiushan Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to the sudden rebellion of the Tianling Sect within Jiushan Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With an inside and outside attack, they, in collusion with the Five Elders Council, managed to seize control of Jiushan Prefecture in one fell swoop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fall of Jiushan Prefecture sent shockwaves throughout the Immortal Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance declared a state of emergency preparedness and, to prevent the Five Elders Council from expanding their gains, dispatched large numbers of cultivators to the border to establish defensive lines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cultivators in each prefecture were also prohibited from moving freely and were mostly confined to their respective Heavenly Cities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance was discussing how to reclaim Jiushan Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And in places they could not see, the armies of the Sacred Dynasty, aboard Puxian True Boats, appeared within the Immortal Alliance prefectures, using the White Mist barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as the Saint Emperor gave the order, they would descend like a swarm of locusts and launch a general offensive against the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother, when do we make our move? I can't wait any longer."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the white mist, Ouyang Tian rubbed his hands, his eyes penetrating the white mist barrier, filled with excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait a bit longer. Wait until the formations in the central four prefectures are complete." Sun Erlang said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, Elder Qiao's move to divert the disaster is truly a stroke of genius. The Myriad Immortals Alliance has deployed a large number of troops to the border, which is undoubtedly a great blessing for us." Wang Xuanba said, playing with a white snake-like exotic beast in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't be careless. Master once said that the Myriad Immortals Alliance is far more complex than it appears. Those cultivators... are merely distractions."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Do you think our Sacred Dynasty's Sky Patrol Arrows and Sacred Army puppets are any different from the Immortal Alliance's? True victory must be forged through life-and-death combat." Sun Erlang had a clear understanding of the battle situation and admonished them.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-304" class="calibre1">Chapter 1292: Da Qi Ling Huang Xuan (7K)</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the eldest disciple of the Sacred Dynasty, Sun Erlang was in charge of all affairs of the Sacred Dynasty in the absence of the Saint Emperor. No one would refute his pre-battle summary and mobilization.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After several more days of lurking in the white mist, a beam of light streaked across the sky and entered the Puxian True Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a message from an unknown source.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang narrowed his eyes as he examined it and his spirit was greatly lifted: "We have confirmed intelligence. The Myriad Immortals Alliance will launch their campaign to retake Jiushan Prefecture tomorrow. Simultaneously, to deter the Five Elders Council, they will also launch small-scale harassing attacks in multiple border regions..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, everyone in the Sacred Dynasty present had their eyes light up: "The Immortal Alliance's actions are even grander than we anticipated!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let them fight! The fiercer the better!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Sun Erlang's thoughts stirred, a massive light cluster representing the Myriad Immortals Alliance's territories instantly appeared before everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the Myriad Immortals Alliance's battle to retake Jiushan Prefecture erupts, it will be the moment the Sacred Dynasty's army marches."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Before that, no one is to act rashly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">While Sun Erlang was speaking, he and Ou Shangtian had already cooperated to activate the Puxian True Boat's internal blockade formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Before the decisive battle, I have one more top-secret matter to announce. It concerns the victory or defeat of the war, and it absolutely cannot be leaked. Therefore, during this period, the warship will be under lockdown. Entry is permitted, but exit is not. All communication will also be severed."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Please excuse me," Sun Erlang said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone's eyes flickered with a hint of surprise, unable to comprehend what kind of confidential content required such caution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang closed his eyes and waited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the grim atmosphere, the Puxian True Boat fell into absolute silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After an unknown amount of time, Sun Erlang suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Myriad Immortals Alliance has made their move."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now, it's our turn."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang suddenly stood up and bowed deeply towards the void ahead: "Greetings, Master!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone on the warship was startled and looked towards where Sun Erlang was bowing. Under the starlight, the Saint Emperor's figure descended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Welcome, Saint Emperor!" everyone bowed in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it was just a projection and not his actual presence, everyone dared not show the slightest disrespect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor did not utter empty platitudes but simply said in a deep voice: "This battle, the Sacred Dynasty will surely win."</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a wave of his hand, the Saint Emperor's projection transformed into points of starlight, all flying into the cultivators present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone felt as if they had transformed into a planet and arrived in the vast sea of stars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They revolved around the central star, resembling the great sun in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even better, the star sea seemed to echo with a vast stellar force, like a woven star net, connecting everyone together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even without words or divine sense, they could communicate freely with the flow of their thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also discovered that the stars in the star sea were not limited to those within the Puxian True Boat at this moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were also a greater number of them, the Sacred Dynasty's low-level generals who had already infiltrated various prefectures of the Immortal Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I will now give the deployment orders," Sun Erlang's voice echoed in the star sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wang Xuanba and Senior Qiao Gong, lead the First and Third Legions, responsible for attacking the 130 prefectures in the eastern part of the Immortal Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ou Shangtian and Daoist Ou, lead the Second and Ninth Legions, responsible for the 126 prefectures in the southern part of the Immortal Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Su Yuqing and Senior Bai Hua, lead the Fifth Legion and the Myriad Realms Allied Army, to attack the 154 prefectures in the western part of the Immortal Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Sun Erlang completed each deployment order, Wang Xuanba and the others felt their positions in the star sea shift rapidly. After settling in the new star domain, they also established connections with other planets in the same region.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a slight movement of their thoughts, information about the main generals of their respective legions appeared clearly in their minds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The operational objective is to focus on capturing the Celestial Cities of each prefecture. Other cultivation sects and forces within the prefectures, if they resist, clear them out. If they choose to observe, then temporarily ignore them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At the time of the war, the channels of the Heavenly Profound Mirrors and the teleportation arrays in each prefecture of the Immortal Alliance will all be paralyzed..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the diagram of the defensive formation of the Immortal Alliance's Celestial Cities. According to the information noted in the diagram, break the formation. Those defenses are like nothing to us. If they activate the backup formation, I will immediately transmit the method to break the flaws."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">One by one, the information was conveyed in an orderly manner. As everyone present looked at the materials in their hands, they became increasingly excited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only were there lists of major cultivators guarding each prefecture, but even their respective realms, strengths, and even cultivation techniques were clearly marked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The details of their opponents were almost completely exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the Myriad Immortals Alliance knew almost nothing about them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How could this war be lost?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No wonder Sun Erlang was so serious before. This document was definitely leaked by the higher echelons of the Immortal Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the shock brought by Sun Erlang was not over yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea network you are currently seeing is the manifestation of the Saint Emperor's divine power. Besides the simplest communication function, you can also use the Saint Emperor's divine power to instantly transfer to face each other."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You can utilize this advantage to use numbers against the few and defeat them separately."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bright star in the center of the star sea suddenly erupted with dazzling light, illuminating the stars in the star sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, various applications of the Saint Emperor's divine power appeared clearly in everyone's minds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone could not help but marvel again at the greatness of the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">While the pre-war general council was still ongoing in the Lingxu Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It should be fine, right?" Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong looked at the pattern carved on the ground, resembling a spinning wheel, with some suspicion. They had not felt any binding or restrictive force from it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Senior, please rest assured. If Cui Shaojiang acts, it will definitely be foolproof!" A young man wearing a blue round hat smiled and assured them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cui Shaojiang forced out a drop of his vital blood and waved it towards the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The vital blood merged into the spinning wheel on the ground, bursting out with fine blood-colored threads. Then, they rapidly flew towards the sky and disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alas, in the current Beast Taming Sect, only I can perform this unique skill." Cui Shaojiang said, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong looked at the spinning wheel pattern on the ground with some suspicion. They did not feel any binding or restrictive force from it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cui Shaojiang seemed to see their distrust and patiently explained: "The current Beast Taming Sect is different from the past. After the great calamity, we migrated here. For a thousand years, we gradually abandoned the traditional beast-taming methods and turned to the 'Beast Spirit Integration' technique."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Cui Shaojiang spoke, the blue round hat on his head suddenly came alive, growing two round black eyes and observing Qing and Hong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though they knew some of the Beast Taming Sect's situation before, seeing it with their own eyes was still somewhat unbelievable for Qing and Hong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In their perception, there were not two separate auras of beast and human, but from beginning to end, there was only one person before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not by law, but by spirit integration. This is the breakthrough of our Beast Taming Sect's ancestors after studying the Beast Taming Wheel. Speaking of which, Senior Xu Ke also played a part in this." He touched his head, and the blue round hat returned to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'm getting off track. Let's talk about this Beast Taming Wheel. Senior Xu Ke's replica is indeed excellent. Combined with the Beast Taming Sect's thousand years of technical accumulation, it is enough to unleash the power of the original Beast Taming Wheel and summon Emperor Sansheng Mo here..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cui Shaojiang's eyes flashed with excitement: "We are very much looking forward to this legendary wise beast. If we can achieve spirit integration with him..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cui Shaojiang's gaze inadvertently drifted towards the outside of the open space, where the Beast Taming Sect had already set up a net. The beast-taming beasts, who had abandoned the sect and left without a word, were not forgotten by the Beast Taming Sect. Their memories of it had not faded with time but had become even more profound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, when Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong came with the replica Beast Taming Wheel to persuade them, it was a natural agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the ground, the red light seemed to be alive, constantly waving its claws. The spinning wheel pattern even trembled slightly, as if ready to leap from the ground at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cui Shaojiang squinted his eyes. He felt that Emperor Sansheng Mo had taken the bait.</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Myriad Immortals Alliance Headquarters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While waiting and pretending to visit and wander, Xu Ke and Yin Shangren suddenly sensed that the Museum of Divine Treasures seemed to have brightened slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The heavy feeling that had been suppressed in their hearts also suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Grandfather Sansheng has left." Xu Ke immediately judged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Shall we act now?" Yin Shangren was eager to try.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's wait. Let's wait for Saint Emperor's side..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The breakthroughs of the Beast Taming Sect in recent years have even surprised me. They chose to go into seclusion at the time of the great calamity, preserving a large amount of talent. It was indeed useful." Xu Ke said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Okay, we can wait. It's just a matter of time. By the way, let me show you this..." Yin Shangren pulled Xu Ke towards an exhibit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke looked closely and saw a golden tree with a peculiar shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The leaves of the tree were all triangular, and the trunk was carved with small figures interacting in various poses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This item isn't an ancient artifact of the Xuanhuang Realm, is it?" Xu Ke said with a strange expression after observing it for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course not. It comes from my hometown."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Or rather, the part of my hometown where the residual consciousness is most complete." Yin Shangren said leisurely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I originally thought that place was completely gone, but I didn't expect that the most important golden tree would be preserved in this Museum of Divine Treasures."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This tree... is there anything special about it?" Xu Ke knew that Yin Shangren would not be sighing about past events for no reason, so he immediately asked, his heart stirred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren chuckled: "In my world, there is no sun or moon. The light of the entire world depends on this golden tree. Even the origin of all life originates from under this tree. You saw the carvings on the tree; they are the imprints of human interactions over the ages under the tree."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although the world was destroyed, as long as this tree exists, the power of the world's origin is almost one-third preserved."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke began to understand and then said with some surprise: "Do you have a way to detonate the energy within this tree?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren touched his scalp and smiled without replying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Are you willing? That's your hometown! If this tree is well-preserved, after the Saint Emperor conquers the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters, perhaps he can help recreate that world." Xu Ke said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren snorted coldly: "Everyone is dead, what's the point of recreating the world? Do you expect me to act as their stand-in and perform a solo play?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just detonate it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke responded with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the two were talking, they suddenly felt the ground beneath their feet tremble slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They looked at each other and simultaneously looked up towards the outside of the Museum of Divine Treasures. Although their vision could not penetrate, they could vaguely feel that a major change had occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their senses were not wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, a wondrous scene was unfolding in the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The originally bright sky suddenly dimmed as if night had fallen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sun in the sky disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Points of starlight lit up from various places in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the shining stars, a bright moon rose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Xuanhuang cultivators soon discovered that this "moon" was even brighter than the original sun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the giant jade plate slowly approached, the Xuanhuang Realm was illuminated once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cultivators looked up at the sky and saw that within the bright moon, magnificent pagodas were erected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was clearly another world!</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief moment of mental blankness, countless thoughts flooded the minds of the Xuanhuang cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is this the legendary Xuanxianzhou?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Has the Xuanxianzhou attacked?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I heard the Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Council are at war, could it be a surprise attack by the Five Elders Council?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Beware of vigilance!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">When things are abnormal, there must be a demon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that they were in a state of wartime preparation, the Myriad Immortals Alliance's reaction was swift.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The defensive formations of the Celestial Cities in all prefectures were immediately activated, and alarms resounded through the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even more cultivators transformed into beams of white light and shot straight towards the moon-like world in the sky, wanting to investigate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But even though it appeared close at hand, the investigating cultivator could never fly into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if there was a chasm between them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Myriad Immortals Alliance stood ready, but saw several beams of bright light descend from the moon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moonlight was like a knife, accurately striking the borders of the four central prefectures of the Immortal Alliance: Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, and Tianquan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sky of the four central prefectures of the Immortal Alliance instantly became coated with a silver sheen, becoming illusory and hazy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But apart from that, there seemed to be no other anomalies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After cautiously waiting for a long time, the cultivators of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance concluded that there were no other anomalies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they soon realized they were wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The teleportation arrays are unusable! We've been sealed off!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The communication spirit talismans can't be used either!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We've lost contact with other prefectures. However, we can still contact the Immortal Alliance headquarters."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What did they say? To act according to the situation? Everyone is already at our doorstep! Damn it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The four prefectures immediately descended into chaos.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some hot-tempered cultivators flew directly to the border of the prefectures covered by the silver light, trying to cross the blockade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The white mist barrier under the moonlight seemed to gain a touch of sacred solemnity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A cultivator, bracing himself, charged directly into the white mist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although he had prepared for the possibility of his lifespan being shortened by several years, the scene he saw after entering the white mist left him dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he stepped out of the boundary, the white mist that had filled his vision instantly disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was replaced by an boundless starry sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if he had truly entered the void outside the Xuanhuang Realm, surrounded by darkness and coldness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the distance, faint traces of countless brilliant stars could be seen, occasionally sparkling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cultivator was stunned and wanted to return, but found that the path he came from had disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He then thought it was an illusion and used sword techniques and magic spells one after another, but not a single ripple was stirred in the starry sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instantaneous teleportation techniques also failed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Conversely, as the spiritual power in his body was consumed, the surrounding cold starry sky environment began to erode his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Helpless, the cultivator could only choose a direction and fly continuously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He tried to leave the range of this starry sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But they did not know that the star sea was boundless, and without the correct method, even if they spent a lifetime, they would not be able to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside the great formation, cultivators continuously stepped into the moonlight boundary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The great formation was like an endless abyss, swallowing all of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nascent Soul, God Transformation, even Dao Integration. Regardless of their cultivation level, as long as they entered, they would never return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a period of probing, the cultivators of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance were finally deterred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance Headquarters also finally issued an emergency order, prohibiting cultivators in the four prefectures from acting recklessly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Several beams of rainbow light traversed the prefectures and arrived at the moonlight boundary in Tianquan Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among them was Lu Xichan, the Chief Formation Master of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This formation..." Lu Xichan examined the moonlight shining on the white mist barrier, her eyes filled with shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A young man in white robes beside her frowned and asked, "When can we break this formation? We've lost contact with the prefectures outside the great formation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not only are the teleportation arrays malfunctioning, but even the Heavenly Profound Mirror channels are blocked," the young man in white robes said with some worry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This young man in white robes was one of the core Law Transmitters of the Immortal Alliance, Ren, the Law Transmitter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Xichan dared not delay and replied: "This formation seems to be drawing the power of the Star Sea, and then using infinite spatial transformations to generate a starry sky that resembles the real one..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dao Transmitter Ren coldly interrupted Lu Xichan: "When can we break the formation?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Xichan's voice abruptly stopped. After a long pause, she said, "The complexity of this formation is unprecedented in my life. It should take at least fifteen days..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dao Transmitter Ren said coldly: "I will give you ten days."</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a cold snort, Dao Transmitter Ren flashed away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only Lu Xichan and several other formation masters from the Immortal Alliance's Formation Hall were left behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Xichan looked up at the great star formation covering the sky, and cold sweat gradually dripped from her forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The more profound the formation masters present were, the more despair filled their eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not that the Immortal Alliance's formation masters were all useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was simply that the formation laid down by the Saint Emperor this time far surpassed the current era.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's hundreds of reincarnations, with constant deductions using the TERMINAL DISSOLUTION DISC, accumulated array knowledge beyond several generations of Xuanhuang. Furthermore, it incorporated insights from Li Fan, or rather, the DISSOLUTION DISC, after obtaining several immortal-level formations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After being infused with these array essentials, the Saint Emperor, relying on his enlightenment in the Star Sea, further deduced the array to a deeper level.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, above the Celestial Cities of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance, covering almost half of the sky, was the bright moon, representing the Sacred Dynasty Da Qi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless citizens of Da Qi gathered in the Sacred Heart Hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing the Saint Emperor's statue, they knelt and prayed devoutly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Sacred Capital City, below the Saint Emperor's throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tens of thousands of created second-generation Abyssal people chanted praises for the Saint Emperor's great virtue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Dynasty's purple-gold aura mingled with the golden Origin Force essence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Forming a faint purple-gold starlight, it left the Sacred Dynasty's territory and maintained the operation of the great formation that trapped the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This ultimate trapping formation, named the [Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation] by the Saint Emperor, was almost infinitely close to a true immortal-level formation. Li Ping believed that even a Law Transmitter would need some time to break it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the people in the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance who wanted to break the formation...</p>
<p class="calibre2">They would have to ask him, the Heavenly Mandate Saint Emperor, whether he agreed or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping sat on the Saint Emperor's throne, his gaze spanning the boundaries between two worlds, falling upon the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's throne, or rather, the entire Sacred Capital City, fell into profound silence due to the impending war.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mao Bao was still in its usual state, lazily sleeping on Li Ping's shoulder. It seemed that besides Origin Force essence, nothing else could move it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides Mao Bao, a figure resembling a child of eight or nine years old also stood beside the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gazing intently at the Xuanhuang Realm below.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Tianyang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, his puppet body had undergone earth-shattering changes after receiving massive infusions of Origin Force essence and combat memories of the Immortal Puppet [Ancestor]. Its appearance and physique had returned to its living form. In fact, it had truly been born with the aura of life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His strength was unfathomable, gazing at the Myriad Immortals Alliance, awaiting the arrival of his opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And below the Saint Emperor's throne, Yi Jue Daoist of the Du'er Sect had brought out all the paper figures of his entire sect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The paper figures recreated the mountain gate of the Du'er Sect from that year on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the center of the buildings, a passage leading to an unknown destination seemed to have opened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Yi Jue Daoist himself did not enter, his eyes, protruding infinitely outwards, stretched deep into the passage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Emperor, please rest assured. If anything happens in the Xuanhuang Realm, this old Daoist will definitely see it," Yi Jue Daoist said with a chuckle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping did not respond to Yi Jue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, most of his gaze and attention were focused on the starry sky outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There, he had made thorough preparations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Waiting for the Heavenly Physician and the Law Transmitter to descend.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Luo Yan Prefecture, when the Luo Yan Celestial City was breached, most of the Sacred Dynasty soldiers had already transferred to other battlefields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a small number were left to guard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, from the wilderness outside Luo Yan Prefecture, a large group of cultivators suddenly emerged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They did not try to recapture Luo Yan Celestial City, but after a surprise attack, they quickly withdrew.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-305" class="calibre1">Chapter 1293: Needle Point Against Awn</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"They all got away? What were you all eating!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"These cultivators are too fast! Their movements are uniform and well-trained; they don't seem like scattered remnants."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not their speed, they just disappeared into thin air right in front of us!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">An image spread through the Sacred Dynasty's Star Network.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Dynasty soldiers were about to catch the attackers, but at the critical moment, they turned into nothingness and dissipated into the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Dynasty soldiers thought they had teleported away and wanted to continue the pursuit, but found no trace of spatial fluctuations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Requesting support. Currently, the number of soldiers in Luoyan Prefecture is at its limit just to hold the Heavenly City. We are unable to pursue and eliminate the remaining forces of the Immortal Alliance within the territory."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We in Shilin Prefecture have already completely cleared out the resistance. We can rush over!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We're almost there too! Brothers, hold on!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang looked at the various communications within the eastern battlefield, considering whether to dispatch more troops to encircle and suppress Luoyan Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, like a lightning bolt flashing in his mind, Sun Erlang's heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, a wave of doubt washed over him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He suddenly remembered something his Master had said before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No, no. Luoyan Prefecture, Luoyan Prefecture should have been destroyed once already. Although the Myriad Immortals Alliance rebuilt it later, there couldn't possibly be so many cultivators defending it…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How could I have forgotten something so important?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sharp gleam flashed in Sun Erlang's eyes. He had already sensed something was amiss and immediately issued an order to all Sacred Dynasty soldiers: "Halt all support to Luoyan Prefecture for now. I will personally send someone to resolve it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Thirty-Sixth Legion, responsible for guarding Luoyan Prefecture, should also withdraw as soon as possible."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Military orders are like mountains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No one questioned, they simply executed the command quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am Lan Xiangwen, the commander of the Thirty-Sixth Legion of the First Army. I have led my troops to complete the withdrawal. According to the order, we are retreating to Lueying Prefecture."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But... I didn't see any of our people here."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Lan Xiangwen, what nonsense are you talking about? We've been waiting for you at the agreed location, and we haven't seen a single hair of you! Where exactly are you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No, Lan Xiangwen, your location shows you are still within Luoyan Prefecture! What is your Thirty-Sixth Legion doing?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the communications of the eastern battlefield, a hint of chaos began to appear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba, the overall commander of the eastern battlefield, decisively isolated the communications of these people and then began to question them in detail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this time, Sun Erlang's voice also came through.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanba, this place is strange. According to my confirmation, after all the soldiers of the Thirty-Sixth Legion entered Luoyan Prefecture, their positions have never changed. It's as if they've fallen into a deep sleep."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, do not believe any information they report. It is likely an illusion from their dreams."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba was slightly surprised: "I have already sent a beast body puppet to infiltrate it and couldn't find them. But I never expected it to be an illusion?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, we previously broke through the newly built Luoyan Heavenly City. The first batch of soldiers transferred did indeed move out of Luoyan Prefecture. It should be some method employed by the Immortal Alliance later. Perhaps it's not even the Myriad Immortals Alliance..." Sun Erlang voiced his conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"My puppet body has already entered Luoyan Prefecture..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">In front of Sun Erlang, the scene of Luoyan Prefecture appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba's beast body, located through the Star Sea's sensing, was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was not even any sign of battle in the entire Luoyan Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Calm and peaceful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even the puppet body can be dragged into an illusion?" Sun Erlang's heart grew slightly heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alas, what is fake will always remain fake!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppet, with its black and gold patterns, extended its arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Energy surged within the puppet's body, and a long bow made of pure golden energy instantly appeared at its fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bowstring was drawn like a crescent moon, and a silver arrow appeared with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hum!</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief charge, the silver light shot out like a dragon, piercing the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The immense energy shattered the surrounding space, about to reveal the reality beneath its illusory exterior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this critical moment, a somewhat pale hand stretched out from the void without warning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It gently grasped the Sky-Patrolling Arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how the silver light of the arrow erupted, it was firmly held and could not move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, the light completely dissipated, turning into an ordinary arrow in that hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The space previously pierced by the Sky-Patrolling Arrow also restored itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That pale arm that stopped the Sky-Patrolling Arrow, without being controlled by Sun Erlang's puppet, gradually dimmed and vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang let out a cold snort.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mysterious golden energy surged from the puppet's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Pfft!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A pair of arms emerged from behind the puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Following that, another pair grew from the left side of its torso.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only after a total of eight pairs, sixteen arms, grew did the puppet's movements finally stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the added structures, the puppet's overall size nearly doubled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden patterns on its surface seemed to come alive, constantly flowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like thunder striking the earth, eight long bows appeared sequentially in the puppet's hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bowstrings were pulled taut, and eight Sky-Patrolling Arrows pointed in different directions, ready to be unleashed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Break!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang roared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eight silver dragons roared and charged outwards from the central puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gold and silver vied for brilliance, even briefly obscuring the moonlight projected by the Great Qi in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if only this brute force creation existed between heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Where the eight Sky-Patrolling Arrows passed, the space shattered like a broken mirror, layer by layer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But strangely, the fragments did not fly outwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, they froze in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The silver dragons continued to speed forward, completely crushing everything in their path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the places they had destroyed seemed to be frozen in time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reality outside the illusion was thus not truly revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang's pupils contracted sharply as the pale arm reappeared once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, it did not stop the eight Sky-Patrolling Arrows.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, it leisurely yet rapidly picked up the frozen fragments of the illusion, one by one, and then placed them back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If this pale arm were allowed to continue restoring the spacetime, the formidable eight-arrow dance, capable of heavily injuring eight Harmonious Dao cultivators, would likely be like punching cotton, having no effect whatsoever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang would naturally not let his opponent succeed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if it's just a puppet body, yet it refuses to show its face from beginning to end..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Are you looking down on me too much!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppet's eight pairs of arms moved across its body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They wriggled and fused, instantly becoming a pair of incredibly thick arms, almost the size of the puppet's main body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden patterns on the puppet's body seemed to come alive and flowed unstoppably. The puppet instantly flashed forward and grabbed the pale arm with immense force.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Crunch, crunch...</p>
<p class="calibre2">This seemingly slender arm, however, contained unimaginable power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only did it not impede its movement, but the giant puppet's arm was instead dragged along by the opponent, continuing its original trajectory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dark gold patterns on the puppet's body were already operating at their extreme.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang could faintly feel that in this high-intensity power struggle, the puppet body had reached its limit and was about to disintegrate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next moment, Sun Erlang's true self's eyes flashed with a cold light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Remote power support from other dark gold puppets was instantly infused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bang!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the cover of golden light, the puppet's body instantly expanded several times over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the sudden surge of immense strength, the movement of the pale arm was reversed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Capitalizing on the advantage, the energy erupted to its peak, attempting to force out the mastermind behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The idea was beautiful, but just as Sun Erlang felt he was about to succeed, a sudden, inexplicable chill washed over him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he felt...</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if another pale, icy arm had been placed on the puppet body's shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a slight press, the puppet's previous extreme state was broken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its body staggered and lost its balance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before it could even adjust, Sun Erlang felt pale hands, one after another, emerging from the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They pressed down on the puppet body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The strength of each hand seemed not very strong, but united, they pressed down on the puppet like a mountain and a sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppet was instantly submerged in a pile of white hands, unable to move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hum!</p>
<p class="calibre2">A drop of blood trickled from Sun Erlang's eye as he was forcefully pulled out of the puppet manipulation state.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had a premonition that if he continued to manipulate the puppet and be pulled into that unknown place by those pale hands, his true self would suffer extremely severe injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Longevity Realm..." At this moment, Sun Erlang had already confirmed the opponent's strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was no longer something he could handle. A trace of unwillingness flashed in his heart, but Sun Erlang did not force it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You can retreat now. I will handle this place," Qiao Gong's voice suddenly sounded in the puppet's ear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This treasure was painstakingly crafted by me. I can't just hand it over to you..." Qiao Gong muttered, and his figure immediately appeared beside the dark gold puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a sweep of his rotating blade, a simple circle was drawn on the pale arms tightly gripping the puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless arms were torn like white paper, breaking off at the wound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's go!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong patted the dark gold puppet's shoulder, and the puppet gradually returned to its normal size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, with a flash of light, it teleported away from this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the last moment, Sun Erlang realized that those severed pale arms were actually just sections of willow branches.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Willow branches?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong also raised the same question at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He wanted to take over the pruned willow branches, but his hand passed through empty air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While he was stunned, the originally dense, myriad pale arms had already melted back into space and disappeared again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They won't even show their hands? They're really not giving me, Qiao Gong, any face."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong did not show any anger on his face. Instead, he took out a circular bronze plate from his embrace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the bronze plate, several amusingly posed small figures were placed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The small figures were originally playing, but after being taken out by Qiao Gong, they immediately became nervous and uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They pointed towards different directions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without Qiao Gong making any move, a rope-like shadow flew out from his side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It flew rapidly, concealing itself in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a while, as if colliding with something, the black rope began to sway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The small figures on the bronze plate kept pointing, and the black shadow beside Qiao Gong continued to shoot out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before long, a bizarre and sinister black net was formed with Qiao Gong at the center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The small figures on the bronze plate seemed to have completed their mission, patting their chests with relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong, however, reached out and picked up one of the small figures.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the small figure was very reluctant, it was helpless. With a whistle, the small figure split into two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a somersault, the two figures became four.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In no time, they transformed from a single small figure into an army of small figures.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each small figure looked unhappy, jumping onto the black rope.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, under faint, orderly shouts, the small figures began to collectively pull the black shadow in front of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The giant black net instantly retracted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding space trembled slightly, and fragments that had been restored to reality exploded again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something seemed to be on the verge of being pulled out from beneath the illusory surface.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong squinted his eyes and watched intently, muttering, "Even the Immortal Puppet [Ancestor] can be moved, how can I not deal with you?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sigh echoed inexplicably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A faint zither music seemed to come from the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The originally energetic small figures instantly became listless, starting to slack off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong's expression turned vigilant as he looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why must we fight..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sorrowful and mournful voice echoed around Qiao Gong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong looked around, then smiled and said, "You speak well! Why must we fight! Qiao Gong is not good at fighting..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since neither of us is willing to fight, why don't we sit down and talk properly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">To prove his sincerity, Qiao Gong even put away the bronze plate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The small figures cheered and stopped working. Qiao Gong smiled and looked around: "This humble one is Qiao Gong from the Heavenly Mystery Realm. May I ask your name, Daoist friend?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other party was indeed a Longevity Realm expert.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, during Qiao Gong's brief exchange with him, he did not detect any trace of the Xuán Huáng Realm's Heavenly Dao being reversed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, he judged that the other party, like him, was a survivor from another shattered cultivation realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of silence, the melodious and solemn voice spoke again: "I... don't remember."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I just don't want to see fighting. I have no ill intentions."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Following the other party's words, Qiao Gong saw the scene of the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty in the entire Luoyan Heavenly City falling into a beautiful slumber. Their lives were safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong also felt relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although he was not afraid, it was best to avoid conflict with a Longevity Realm expert if possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Actually, we also have no ill intentions..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong smiled and started chatting with the other party.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang received the message from Qiao Gong and sighed slightly in his heart: "Indeed, the difference between the Longevity Realm and the Harmonious Dao Realm is like a chasm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, if all the dark gold puppets were present at that time..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We might have been able to fight."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the Sacred Dynasty army's defeat in Luoyan Prefecture was merely an accident,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then their encounter in Tianling Prefecture was solid proof that the Myriad Immortals Alliance did have some foundation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After much effort, the Sacred Dynasty army conquered Tianling Heavenly City, only to discover it was an empty city. The important cultivators within the city had already been transferred. Only cultivators without background were left to resist with mechanisms and magical artifacts. The Sacred Dynasty soldiers quickly realized it might be a trap, but before they could retreat, the entire Tianling Heavenly City exploded. The giant floating city, along with nearly ten thousand cultivators from both sides, instantly turned to ash. Phenomena of death erupted all over the sky. Many strange visions intermingled and distorted, making it impossible to distinguish. In a hidden valley in Tianling Prefecture. "Fortunately, Brother Sun reminded us, otherwise our Tianling Prefecture would have encountered misfortune," said Song Mansheng, the City Lord of Tianling, stroking his beard with a smile. Sun Liancheng’s gaze remained fixed on the giant ball of fire in the sky, saying, "We still have to rely on City Lord's wisdom. If not for your decisive action, even with my suggestion, the effect of killing the enemy would not have been so good." The cultivators in the valley all echoed the sentiment: "Yes, according to our observers inside the city, at least ten thousand bandits were buried in this explosion." "Heh heh, fellow Daoist, you're mistaken. It was clearly twenty thousand!" "...Uh, yes, yes, yes. It was twenty thousand! There's video evidence to prove it!" Everyone tacitly agreed. "Speaking of which, who exactly are these people? They attacked without warning, and most importantly, they could even interfere with the teleportation array and the Heavenly Profound Mirror." Sun Liancheng interrupted the celebration. "They should not be from the Five Elders Council. I have fought with cultivators from the Five Elders Council, and the aura I sensed from them is completely different." "No matter who they are, as long as the Immortal Alliance headquarters makes a move, they will all die. For now, they are just arrogant." "Lord Song, should we take the opportunity to strike and gain merit?" Someone in the valley suggested. Song Mansheng pondered for a moment and did not make a decision, instead looking at Sun Liancheng. Sun Liancheng narrowed his eyes and remained silent for a long time. After everyone waited, Sun Liancheng finally shook his head: "The situation is unclear, and it is difficult for me to judge." Song Mansheng nodded upon hearing this: "Since that's the case, let's wait. It's not wise to act rashly when the situation is unclear." Everyone in the valley naturally agreed. Song Mansheng, however, took Sun Liancheng aside for a private conversation. "Brother Sun, you weren't telling the whole truth just now," Song Mansheng said gravely. Sun Liancheng forced a bitter smile: "I really didn't dare to say it, otherwise I fear it would affect the morale of the troops!" Song Mansheng's expression became stern: "Is it that serious?" Sun Liancheng said: "Yes. Master, you also know that I could predict the enemy's sudden attack this time entirely thanks to the sensing of our Sun family's destiny. That day, I was chatting with my nephew, but I suddenly felt that our family's destiny was like a candle in the wind, precarious..." "Extremely frightened, it took me quite some effort to determine that the reason was not from the Immortal Alliance, but from the outside. I initially thought it was an attack from the Five Elders Council, but I never expected it to be a group of unknown bandits." "Our family's future destiny has been fluctuating. Sometimes it's extremely prosperous, and sometimes it's a great omen of doom, with the bloodline severed. It's truly terrifying..." Sun Liancheng sighed. Song Mansheng's brow furrowed even deeper. Sun Liancheng advised: "Regardless, with the credit for destroying the city, you will definitely be rewarded generously during the merit awarding ceremony. You already have enough merit, so why take such a risk? I think the enemy's reinforcements will arrive soon, and those bandits are quite powerful. It's better to hide here in this valley." "With the natural concealment of the great formation, the enemy should not be able to detect us..." Song Mansheng was finally persuaded and suppressed the desire to act. Sun Liancheng's judgment seemed to be correct. Less than half a day later, Song Mansheng saw a large group of bandits swarming over. They had hateful expressions and were meticulously searching every corner of Tianling Prefecture. As they flew over the valley together, everyone in the valley held their breath and their hearts stopped. Fortunately, destiny was still on their side, and they were not exposed. "How many are there? Have we poked a hornet's nest?" "Why do we only see the enemy's reinforcements, where are our Immortal Alliance people!" In the valley, everyone was nervously looking up at the sky and whispering. The previous ease was gone. Sun Qi, however, quietly approached Sun Liancheng. "Uncle, something is wrong." Sun Liancheng's expression changed. He looked around vigilantly, ensuring no one was paying attention, and then communicated with Sun Qi via telepathy. "The fluctuating family destiny has begun to stabilize and lean towards one side. If we continue to stay here, we will only be courting death." Sun Liancheng trembled in his heart. He still trusted his nephew's words. It was precisely because of his uncanny premonition that they had set up an ambush and detonated the Heavenly City, eliminating a large group of bandits. Within the universe, "branching out and scattering" leads to the decline of a family, while "gathering and dispersing" leads to the prosperity of a family. Sun Qi's cultivation technique, the "Reverse Deduction of Heaven and Earth Record," can reverse this trend and make the family destiny more consolidated. The price is that the more prosperous the family becomes, the more the forces of decay will gather on the cultivator. Breaking through each level of cultivation is as difficult as ascending to heaven, and only those with exceptional talent can achieve it. Sun Qi is such a genius. "We must transfer immediately," Sun Liancheng made a decisive decision. "How can we leave now when everyone is watching? We have so many people in our Sun family." Sun Qi was somewhat uneasy. "I have already made arrangements." Sun Liancheng said with great confidence. Within the valley, the Sun family members quietly gathered. However, in the eyes of outsiders, they had not left and were still talking in the same place. "This 'Golden Cicada Sheds Its Shell' secret treasure was obtained during my youthful adventures. I've always been reluctant to use it, but now I have no choice." Sun Liancheng sighed emotionally. The Sun family members, without anyone noticing, had already quietly left through a secret passage known only to Sun Liancheng within the valley. "Quick, the secret treasure's concealment won't last long. Let's find another place to hide." Sun Liancheng urged. Just as they were withdrawing, several beams of white light streaked across the sky and arrived from afar. Their target was the valley they had just hidden in. Boom, boom, boom! The beams of white light hit their target squarely, and unimaginable terrifying energy exploded from the valley. The earth roared and the shockwave swept through, sending the fleeing Sun family members tumbling. Fortunately, the secret treasure's concealment was still effective, and they were not exposed. Sun Liancheng and Sun Qi looked at the valley, which had turned into a circular abyss, their bodies stiffening, their minds blank. "The full power of a Harmonious Dao attack! The explosion just now definitely contained the power of a full-force Harmonious Dao cultivator!" "That's... an arrow?" Just as Sun Liancheng was stunned, he saw several white arrow lights whistling through the sky. His head instinctively retracted. Discovering that the arrows were not directed at him, he hurriedly took his family and rushed towards the next planned hiding place. "No, the entire Tianling Prefecture is no longer safe. We shouldn't stay here for long. We need to find another place to take refuge." While trembling halfway, Sun Liancheng suddenly had an inspiration and changed their travel route at the last minute. He fled rapidly towards Shanteng Prefecture, bordering Tianling Prefecture. Just as they were about to reach the border white mist barrier, the land of Tianling Prefecture suddenly trembled violently. Immediately after, a terrifying scene that the Sun family would never forget occurred. In the sky, five rings interconnected and materialized from the void, descending into the world. From the five rings, countless tentacles extended towards the land of Tianling Prefecture below. And one of them was flying towards the Sun family. "Not good!" Sun Qi's expression changed drastically, and he quickly shouted. However, Sun Liancheng had already acted. Forgetting about his family, he alone turned into a stream of blood light and flew rapidly towards the white mist barrier not far away. However, this desperate technique of burning his soul surprisingly slowed down his speed at a visible rate, as if countless tiny tentacles in the surrounding air were dragging and obstructing him. The blood light dissipated, and Sun Liancheng revealed his true form. He even lost the ability to fly and fell heavily from the sky. The black tentacles in the sky quickly locked onto him. With a fierce thrust, they pierced through Sun Liancheng's body. Sun Liancheng frantically tried to resist, but the surrounding spiritual energy seemed to have solidified, completely unresponsive. Unable to resist at all, the black tentacles quickly passed through Sun Liancheng. Amidst the Sun family's screams, they were also captured by tentacles that differentiated from the sky. The screams only lasted for a while before Sun Liancheng's body was assimilated into the same black tentacles. Even a phenomenon of death did not appear in the sky. Sun Liancheng seemed not to have died, but merely transformed into those black tentacles. As the Sun family members were captured, only Sun Qi's heart turned cold. He dared not move. Yes, the entire Sun family, only he, Sun Qi, survived. Because at the moment he was locked onto by those terrifying tentacles, Sun Qi had a faint feeling in his heart. Faced with myriad paths of death, he found the only glimmer of hope. Therefore, without hesitation, he used the "Body Dissolution Chapter" of the "Supreme Primordial True Scripture" to dismantle his cultivation and expelled all the spiritual energy stored in his body. Thoroughly and completely, he became a mortal. A black tentacle, as thick as an arm, slowly drifted in front of Sun Qi. It circled around Sun Qi as if it had life. Only up close could Sun Qi see that these black tentacles were actually composed of countless densely packed black insects. He didn't even dare to breathe, his whole body stiff. Fortunately, after determining that Sun Qi was purely a mortal without cultivation, the black tentacles let him go. Taking the entire Sun family, who had already transformed into black flying insects, they soared away. Sun Qi remained in the same rigid posture until half a day later, when he finally collapsed to the ground, his body completely limp. "What on earth are these things..." His mind raced with countless thoughts, and it took him a long time to regain some energy. He looked at the white mist barrier not far away and the five rings in the sky that were gradually fading. Sun Qi gritted his teeth and began to cultivate again. After closing his eyes to cultivate for a while, Sun Qi opened his eyes again. He keenly sensed that the spiritual energy in the world... was different from before.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-306" class="calibre1">Chapter 1294: The Sacred Emperor Awakens His Lingering Thoughts</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Qi raised his hand, attempting to touch the sky. Without deliberate manipulation to absorb it, the surrounding spiritual energy eagerly surged into his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This feeling… Sun Qi had not experienced it for a long time. It was as if a towering tree that had been crushing him had been toppled, and Sun Qi felt an unprecedented sense of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hehehehehe..." After a moment of stunned silence, a sinister look gradually appeared in Sun Qi's eyes. "As expected, family, relatives, all are burdens!" "Reversing the Eons, the Eons Reversed, the End of this Path is to be Forever Unique!" "I am the Sun family! The Sun family is me!" "The prosperity of a family, all returns to one person..." Having lived under the shadow of his family for the first half of his life, and now, by a twist of fate, all his relatives were dead. Sun Qi did not feel much sorrow, but instead felt an unprecedented joy. He even vaguely sensed that as the other bloodlines of the Sun family died off, the overall luck of the Sun family had not directly dissipated or disappeared. Instead, it was slowly converging towards him. "Give me ten years, no, five years, and I will not only recover my cultivation but might even reach the Harmonious Dao realm..." The bright future vividly predicted by his strong intuition made Sun Qi's body tremble with excitement. He even wanted to laugh out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, another silver-white arrow whistling overhead made him instantly turn pale and shudder. "Lord Heavenly Venerate! Could it be that cultivators from beyond the Xuanhuang Realm are attacking..." Sun Qi shrunk his head and glanced at the white mist barrier not far away. He gritted his teeth and deliberately accelerated his absorption of spiritual energy. "I can't stay in this Tianling Prefecture anymore. I need to leave quickly..." "It's a pity that all those burdens were captured by the tentacles. If I want to cross the white mist barrier, I still have to rely on myself."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Qi, who had dismantled his cultivation and was rebuilding it, progressed extremely quickly. In just the time it takes for a cup of tea to steep, he had returned to the peak stage of Qi Refining. The bandits continuously flying in the sky grew more numerous, and Sun Qi felt increasingly pressed. "I can now control the flying magical artifact. Let's go to a safe place first." "Crossing only one prefecture's barrier won't significantly reduce my lifespan." "After returning to the Foundation Establishment stage, I can observe future fortunes. But now, I can't wait..." Sun Qi made up his mind, and a transparent sphere enveloped him, flying directly into the white mist.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as he was nearing the Teng Prefecture of Li Shan, Sun Qi was startled to discover some figures faintly discernible within the white mist ahead. His heart filled with dread, he immediately controlled his magical artifact to stop flying. But it was already too late. "Who goes there!" A furious roar, accompanied by colorful spell attacks, flew out from the white mist, all bombarding Sun Qi. Before he could even let out a cry of pain, Sun Qi instantly turned into ashes!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Target eliminated, alert lifted!" Cai Yongchen, the squad leader of the Great Qi's Third Army, inspected the scene and then reported. "Only at the Nascent Soul stage. They must have been panicked cultivators from the Immortal Alliance trying to escape. How unlucky, I thought it would be a bigger catch!" "He's just an unlucky ghost, stumbling right into our alert zone..." "Stop chatting and clear out this area quickly!" Cai Yongchen snorted, cutting off his subordinates' idle chatter. He suddenly sneezed. It was as if something from the Immortal Alliance cultivator, who died without a whole corpse, had entered his body. Cai Yongchen's mind grew alert, and after a careful examination, he found nothing unusual. However, as a professional soldier of the Great Qi army, he did not simply dismiss it. Instead, he very seriously reported the origin of the matter and his own sensations through the Saint Emperor's Grand Network. After completing the report, he breathed a sigh of relief and continued to lead his subordinates in the sweeping mission.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within Sun Erlang's sea of consciousness, similar incident reports kept appearing nonstop. They even included the Sacred Army puppets lost on the battlefield, the quantities of Sky-Patrolling Arrows, the number of Great Qi soldiers killed and injured, and even a list of forces from the Myriad Immortals Alliance who had been captured alive or surrendered... There were also lists of newly produced supplies within the Sacred Dynasty Great Qi in the rear. Sets of real-time changing massive data flashed by. Based on this, the Dao Transformation Stone, glowing blue in Sun Erlang's sea of consciousness, was constantly simulating battle scenarios and making corresponding changes. Although the Myriad Immortals Alliance's various prefectures had shown some resistance, the vast majority of their territories had already completely fallen under the control of the Sacred Dynasty. The Heavenly City's Law Transmission Altars were suppressed by the Saint Emperor's talismans, and new suppression and connection formations were rapidly established. "During the deduction, the Saint Dynasty's victory rate on the outer battlefield is getting higher and higher." "When the situation slowly stabilizes, we can focus on tackling those difficult opponents." "Currently, the number of Harmonious Dao cultivators who have appeared on the outer battlefield is thirty-four. There are still about a hundred more who should have appeared but have not shown themselves..." Thinking of this huge number, Sun Erlang couldn't help but feel a sense of heaviness. Although the Immortal Alliance had the Sky-Patrolling Arrow, a powerful weapon, Harmonious Dao cultivators were not just sitting ducks waiting to be bombarded. It required Great Qi soldiers to engage them. Casualties were inevitable. "Fortunately, the 'Leaving the Realm Rainbow Light Plan' from before has drawn away a large number of veteran Harmonious Dao cultivators from the Immortal Alliance, otherwise this war would have been even more difficult." Sun Erlang looked at the miniature map of the Immortal Alliance before him. Besides the territories of the two sides marked in yellow and purple, there was a unique gray color that indiscriminably encroached upon all areas. It was slowly spreading outwards from Tianling Prefecture. In the areas occupied by gray, the Saint Dynasty had, according to the Dao Transformation Stone's deductions, swiftly resolved the battles with absolute advantages. "Dao Yi Bug..." A scene appeared before Sun Erlang's eyes, where a Harmonious Dao cultivator from the Mountain Vine Prefecture was captured alive by a squad of Golden Core generals from the Great Qi wearing Sacred Army armor. The Immortal Alliance Harmonious Dao cultivator summoned the Heaven and Earth Essence within his body, which was named "Crimson Vine." After the Mountain Vine Heavenly City was captured by the Saint Dynasty soldiers, this Immortal Venerable Crimson Vine only arrived belatedly. Countless vines like fiery dragons erupted in the sky and on the ground, growing wildly and wantonly. The vine branches, imbued with immense power, swept madly, swatting down large numbers of Saint Dynasty soldiers like flies. Crimson Vine rooted itself in mid-air and multiplied on the ground. In the blink of an eye, it covered the entire Mountain Vine Prefecture. The originally continuous mountains and rivers had now become a dense jungle of vines. The military strength of the three legions of the Saint Dynasty, facing the ubiquitous crimson vines, each possessing its own sentience, fell into a bitter battle. Although they were protected by puppet armor, they couldn't withstand being entangled and constantly roasted and absorbed. It seemed as if this Immortal Alliance Harmonious Dao cultivator would truly rely on his own efforts to turn the tide and retake Mountain Vine Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the battle situation immediately took a turn for the worse after an ominous shadow inexplicably descended and engulfed the sky. The originally vibrant crimson vines suddenly became as weak and powerless as a frostbitten eggplant, their attacks becoming feeble. Even the color of their own crimson flames inexplicably dulled slightly. In contrast, the Saint Dynasty soldiers, who had been in a bitter struggle and were exhausted, instantly regained their vigor after the arrival of the gray shadow. They even attacked more fiercely than before! A casual attack, wrapped in spiritual energy, could tear open the previously seemingly indestructible crimson vines. The wounds on the crimson vines did not heal as before, but rather grew larger and larger with continuous combat. It was as if some unseen existence was constantly devouring it! The counterattack of the Saint Dynasty lasted for only one hour. The colossal entity that occupied an entire prefecture's territory eventually became only half the size of an adult. It was captured alive by the Saint Dynasty soldiers and locked into a specially made cage for Immortal Alliance Harmonious Dao cultivators. This cage could isolate the cultivator inside from the outside world and forcibly put the power of the Heaven and Earth Essence within the Harmonious Dao cultivator into a dormant state. Once imprisoned, Harmonious Dao cultivators would be like ordinary mortals, completely unable to escape. The captured Immortal Alliance Harmonious Dao cultivators were all sent to the rear of the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty for unified imprisonment. As the Dao Yi Bug spread, the number of captured Harmonious Dao cultivators continued to climb.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the battle situation on the outer battlefield gradually stabilized, Sun Erlang felt a slight easing of the pressure on his shoulders. He rubbed his sore forehead but did not rest. Instead, he re-examined the information exchanged from the previous battlefield. To prevent missing any details. Soon, he noticed Cai Yongchen's report. He did not believe that Cai Yongchen's feeling at that time was an illusion. Sun Erlang pondered for a moment and ordered someone to bring Cai Yongchen back from the battlefield. After isolating him, he conducted a thorough examination. The result was the same: nothing abnormal was found. However, Sun Erlang still felt a sense of unease. After thinking for a while, he finally used the Star Network to report the entire incident, along with his own feelings during Cai Yongchen's examination, to the Saint Emperor. In less than a moment, the Saint Emperor's reply came. "The abnormality within the body is likely stray [Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth]." "Primordial Qi, is Heaven and Earth." "Qi is the source of all things." "It is a blessing, not a curse, no need to worry. However, this stray Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth comes from a fallen cultivator. It might be accompanied by residual will of the previous life. It is not advisable to remain on the battlefield for now..." Sun Erlang suddenly understood after receiving his master's guidance. At the same time, he marveled at Cai Yongchen's extraordinary fortune. This Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth could barely be considered half a Heavenly Marvel. Although Cai Yongchen absorbed only a portion of it, it was still infinitely beneficial, and could even directly merge with his own Dao foundation, bringing many miraculous uses. "You should return to Great Qi first and recuperate in the Sacred Heart Palace. Wait until you have completely absorbed this Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth before returning to the battlefield!" Sun Erlang explained the origin of the Primordial Qi of Heaven and Earth to Cai Yongchen and then ordered. Cai Yongchen was overjoyed, yet also somewhat regretful. "I hope that by the time I return, the war will be over," Cai Yongchen bowed deeply and turned to leave. Sun Erlang issued personnel orders, filling Cai Yongchen's position. Although it was just a minor incident, it also demonstrated the impact of efficient communication on the overall war situation. Eliminating all potential hidden dangers. Days passed, and only a handful of prefectures remained in fierce combat on the outer battlefield. The rest had all been captured by the Great Qi army. Sun Erlang did not rush to order a final assault on the remaining Immortal Alliance territories. Instead, he ordered the various legions to establish temporary bases and build fortifications. At the same time, they systematically transferred the captured Immortal Alliance cultivators and resources to the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty. Great Qi had already prepared ample space to accommodate and imprison them during the years of preparation. Sun Erlang turned his gaze back to the central four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance. "The Myriad Immortals Alliance's true counterattack should be imminent." Faint fluctuations emanated from the sealed moonlight, and Sun Erlang made this judgment. In Tianquan Prefecture, at the border of the moonlight. Lu Xichan looked at the rising green energy that obscured the moonlight, a hint of joy flashing in her eyes. Although only eight days had passed in real time, the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters had already deduced countless times. They had finally found a possible way to break the formation. Since this formation was incomprehensibly profound, it was best to abandon the idea of "breaking the formation." Instead, they would directly use "Absolute Spiritual Energy" to corrode the formation units. Absolute Spiritual Energy could suppress all spiritual power fluctuations. Under its continuous diffusion and evaporation, it indeed yielded results. The moonlight, originally like a silver ribbon, slowly became hazy as if covered by green smoke. It seemed that the formation would be broken at any moment. However... The bright moon in the sky shone down again. In an instant, the depleted portion was replenished. Even though Lu Xichan had anticipated this and ordered everyone to resist with all their might, they were still unable to stop the moonlight from descending. Looking at the formation that had returned to its original state, Lu Xichan's face turned ashen. "Chief..." The formation masters below also turned pale, despair in their eyes. "I will go invite the Formation Breaking Discs," Lu Xichan said in a deep voice, admitting her failure to break the formation. Transforming into a rainbow light, she disappeared into the horizon. Half a day later, Lu Xichan returned, bringing with her a cultivator wearing a dark green robe, with an imprint like a mirror engraved on his forehead. His face was unrecognizable, and his gender was indiscernible. If Li Fan were present, he would have recognized this as the unique attire of the Mirror Masters lineage of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The Mirror Master ignored all the formation masters present and first looked up at the silver moonlight enveloping the surroundings, nodding slightly. Then, he bowed slightly towards the void. The mirror imprint on his forehead emitted beams of light. A white jade disc appeared in the field under the illumination of the light. The white jade disc flew up on its own, slowly approaching the moonlight from the sky. The moonlight distorted and was absorbed by the white jade disc. The bright projections on the white jade disc seemed to show countless formations evolving. The Mirror Master observed for a moment, then frowned slightly. He then released another white jade disc. However, the effect still seemed insufficient, so he directly released all nine discs together. The nine discs orbited each other, drawing the moonlight into the center. The illusory images of the formations instantly accelerated countless times. "What is that Formation Breaking Disc? It's actually so powerful?" "According to Chief Lu, it's the 'Dissolution Disc,' a nascent form born from the Heavenly Profound Mirror." "Hiss, there's actually such a miraculous object in the world. If it can break formations so easily, what's the use of us formation masters?" ... The formation masters present communicated through telepathy, discussing amongst themselves. Lu Xichan, however, stared intently at the changing patterns in the center of the Dissolution Discs, her brow still furrowed. "Venerable, it seems..." The Mirror Master nodded, looking at the formation in the sky, his expression becoming even more solemn. Then, he paused as if he had made a decision. He flew above everyone's heads, struck a strange pose, and then bowed towards the empty space in front. With a gentle bow, the imprint on his forehead erupted with light. Then, the phantom of an item quietly appeared. The Mirror Master bowed nineteen times. Nineteen illusory objects, of various shapes, appeared in the field. Some were like the Dissolution Discs but with different colors. There were also white jade rulers and green jade slips... The nineteen objects flew to the periphery of the nine Dissolution Discs. They rotated rapidly. The already somewhat illusory images became even more blurry in the rotation. Their forms, consequently, changed. They actually became very similar to the Dissolution Discs in the inner circle. And with the help of the outer Dissolution Discs, the deduction in the center of the ring accelerated again, making it almost impossible to see clearly. The Mirror Master observed for a moment and said, "In three days, we can open a gap in this formation." "We must seize this opportunity to completely resolve the trapping formation." The Mirror Master pointed at the bright moon in the sky and said. Lu Xichan bowed her head and replied, " I will explain this to the Transmission Dharma Masters." The Mirror Master said no more, focusing entirely on the Dissolution Discs and the nineteen phantoms. The formation masters observing were stunned for a moment after witnessing this miraculous sight, and then slowly recovered. "How did nineteen Dissolution Discs appear again? The formation-breaking capability of one Dissolution Disc is already terrifying. Nineteen stacked together..." "I get it! The Profound Azure Mirror, the Heart Measuring Ruler, the Book of Heaven and Earth... these are all nascent forms of the Heavenly Profound Mirror!" A single sentence caused shock among all the formation masters present. "Nineteen items, I only knew the Heavenly Profound Mirror had nascent forms, but I never expected there to be so many!" "No, no, it's been so many years, it's understandable that nineteen items have been nurtured. But I've never heard that they can transform into each other! Doesn't that mean each nascent form can unleash more than ten times its own power?" As if sensing the murmuring of his subordinates, Lu Xichan swept his gaze coldly and then transmitted telepathically, "Stop looking and start discussing how to break the partially deciphered parts of the Dissolution Discs together." "Don't you think breaking the formation means everything is settled? If we can't redeem ourselves afterwards, then from top to bottom, our Immortal Alliance's Formation Hall will be completely replaced." Lu Xichan's words made the formation masters break out in cold sweats, and their attention shifted from the Heavenly Profound nascent forms to the flickering formation illusions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the Saint Emperor's throne.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's gaze pierced through the formation's obstruction and fell upon the twenty-eight Heavenly Profound nascent forms, including the nine Dissolution Discs.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heavenly Profound Mirror, conceiving itself, dividing and transforming the Dao..." The Saint Emperor nodded thoughtfully, genuinely praising, "Even in the mortal realm, it has never abandoned transcending again." "The Heavenly Profound Mirror is truly a precious artifact passed down since ancient times in the Xuanhuang Realm." The Saint Emperor placed his hand on Mao Bao, who was poking its head out curiously, seemingly about to jump off Li Ping's shoulder. Mao Bao, who seemed to be restless, was gently pressed down by the Saint Emperor. Mao Bao was slightly dissatisfied. It gently bit the Saint Emperor's finger, but after being blocked by a ball of golden Origin Force Essence, Mao Bao finally gave up and lay back on Li Ping's shoulder to rest. "Oh, great Saint Emperor, the items below are all precious treasures." Daoist Yijue, with both eyes deep in the vortex tunnel, still managed to see things in the Xuanhuang Realm below and exclaimed, "Each nascent form is equivalent to a path copied and separated by the Heavenly Profound Mirror." "Some of these paths are even ones that the Heavenly Profound Mirror itself does not possess, but were discovered by the Heavenly Profound Mirror while observing this world over the years." "If this old Daoist were still human, even at the cost of his life, he would snatch one! Using it as a foundation, even if he achieved immortality in the future, it would be of great use!" Daoist Yijue continued to brag, seemingly trying to instigate the Saint Emperor to snatch them. Li Ping, however, remained unmoved. "I can comprehend the Dao of Heaven and Earth in the Star Sea. Why would I need external objects?" "Moreover, the Dao observed by the Heavenly Profound Mirror may not be the truth." Li Ping chuckled, leaving Daoist Yijue speechless. "Great Saint Emperor, why are you just watching them break the formation? If you send someone to harass them, not to mention snatching some Heavenly Profound nascent forms, you could at least delay their formation-breaking time." After a moment of silence, Daoist Yijue spoke again. "Yijue, just do what you were tasked to do." Li Ping glanced at Yijue lightly. Yijue chuckled dryly and stopped speaking. "This old fellow was not so talkative before. It seems that the mirror below is indeed very useful to him." At this moment, Tianyang, who had been silent all along, suddenly spoke. The paper figures of the Du'er Sect below nodded slightly, not denying it. However, Daoist Yijue said nothing about its specific use. "You ten sects are still as annoying as ever." Tianyang said softly. It was as if an invisible wind swept through the Saint Emperor's throne hall, causing the paper figures of the Du'er Sect to sway. Even the mountain gate of the Du'er Sect seemed to be on the verge of being blown away. Daoist Yijue waved his hand, and the paper figures huddled together, resisting the wind. Tianyang snorted coldly and turned his gaze away. The great wind gradually subsided. "It seems you have indeed improved significantly." The Saint Emperor said with some joy. "Regaining consciousness and having new insights into the memories of [Ancestor]. Moreover, over the years of sleeping in the earth veins, although the original body has died, the puppet body's experiences are still a treasure. As time flows and the world changes, everything is like this..." Tianyang's small body spoke with a seniority far beyond his years. "Right... take a look at this." After a while, Tianyang took out a set of child's skeletal remains. "Hmm? Isn't this your body from when you were alive?" The Saint Emperor recognized the origin of the remains at a glance. "Yes..." Tianyang's expression was strange. "I can faintly sense a very peculiar power on it. It originates from the obsession I had before I abandoned my body." "It's completely different from the current methods..." Hearing Tianyang's words, the Saint Emperor also became serious. Tianyang gestured, and a crimson-gold light instantly surged onto his skin. Tianyang's body then dissolved and disappeared into the crimson-gold armor that suddenly appeared. The crimson-gold armor split into several pieces and flew to the Saint Emperor's side successively. It automatically adjusted itself to fit the Saint Emperor's physique. In a short time, a puppet battle armor, as if custom-made for the Saint Emperor, was formed, enveloping him completely, exuding a majestic and sacred aura. "Do not resist." Tianyang's voice came from his mind. "Please, witness my life..." Boom! "Tianyang, it's time for your medicine!" Countless images instantly appeared before Li Ping's eyes, depicting Tianyang's life experiences. However, transmitted voluntarily by Tianyang now, it felt as if Li Ping was truly experiencing Tianyang's life firsthand. His fellow disciples, his master, sacrificing themselves to protect him, going to battle one by one... The extremely real scenes and emotions deeply touched the Great Qi Saint Emperor's heart. "Tianyang's life was no weaker than anyone else's!" Tianyang's cry from the heart, from illusory to real, truly echoed in Li Ping's ears. Therefore... The Great Qi Saint Emperor finally began to perceive that peculiar trace of energy from Tianyang's remains, which had been silent until now. It seemed incompatible with everything in the world. Like a cold plum blossom in the snow, standing proudly alone. Although it appeared very weak, it had endured for thousands of years without fading with time. Instead, it grew stronger every day. "This is..." Li Ping seemed to recall something, his hand trembling slightly. However, an invisible existence severed this connection again. The Saint Emperor felt a sense of loss, but his extraordinary willpower quickly suppressed this anomaly. He first used Mao Bao to test it, but finding that even Mao Bao couldn't identify this peculiar energy, he then looked at the Du'er Sect below. The Du'er Sect's paper figures seemed completely unaware, still huddled together. "Yijue, do you know something?" The Saint Emperor Li Ping asked, though he was not entirely sure. Daoist Yijue actually withdrew his protruding eyes from the vortex passage. The two eyeballs, with long strips of paper attached, flew to Tianyang's remains and circled around several times. From Yijue's expression, it seemed he had indeed recognized something. "This old Daoist merely has a guess." "It cannot be considered certain." The Saint Emperor waved his hand, "Speak freely." As if afraid of being overheard, Daoist Yijue glanced back outside the Saint Emperor's throne. Then, he spoke word by word, "Regarding that Grand Heavenly Master Tiandu, our Du'er Sect has had a guess since ancient times." "The Grand Heavenly Master has already perished; what remains is but a trace of his will after death." "Adhering to the Grand Heavenly Master's will to 'pass on the Dao'." As Daoist Yijue spoke, the paper figures of the Du'er Sect embraced each other even tighter, as if a terrifying existence was approaching. "The will to pass on the Dao, it is neither a living being nor energy." "It is more like..." The Saint Emperor pondered, then continued, "Resonance of the Great Dao." Daoist Yijue clapped his hands and praised, "Saint Emperor truly has great comprehension!" "When all immortals fall, their Dao becomes empty. The Immortal Dao is everywhere; anyone who can even slightly approach its essence will create a resonance of the Dao." "Within Tiandu, it is the Dao of passing on." "And on these remains, it might be the [Dao of Contention]."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-307" class="calibre1">Chapter 1295: The Shadow of the Dao of Contention to Prove Immortality</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Heavenly Dao Resonance… The Saint Emperor contemplated, sensing the surging energy within Tianyang’s remains. After a long silence, he let out a sigh. “The Dao can prove immortality, but it does not align with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor’s tone held little regret as he withdrew from Tianyang’s armor state. Returning the remains, Li Ping instructed Tianyang, “The Dao of Strife is empty, but this resonant relic is undoubtedly a rare treasure for you. Contemplate it further. Although immortal paths are not apparent now, the resonance exists, proving the Dao still endures.” “Perhaps, in time, you might truly achieve the True Immortal realm through this!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Daoist Yijue of the Du’er Sect watched enviously as Tianyang put away the remains, then retreated back into the passage with his elongated eyeballs. “A pity, a pity…” Daoist Yijue lamented.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What profound insights does the Sect Master of the Du’er Sect have?” Tianyang, however, was not provoked by the Du’er Sect’s taunts this time. Yijue shook his head, chuckling, “Merely lamenting that the Du’er Sect missed a rare opportunity. As the saying goes, ‘When one person achieves the Dao, their chickens and dogs ascend.’ If His Excellency the Saint Emperor contemplates this remnant knowledge, perhaps one day he will truly attain the Great Dao. We too might benefit.” “As for you…” “Perhaps there will be such a day. But our Du’er Sect will likely not live to see it.” His words unabashedly conveyed his pessimistic outlook on Tianyang’s potential to achieve immortality.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, however, Tianyang was not angered by the Du’er Sect's provocation. He merely sensed the unyielding thoughts within his remains, reminiscent of his human form. But perhaps due to his current state as a puppet, after much effort, Tianyang still could not rekindle the fervor in his heart. “Tianyang’s life, never inferior to others.” The words, when spoken, felt different than before.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A moment of silence descended upon the Saint Emperor’s throne hall. However, it wasn’t long before the commotion from the Myriad Immortals Alliance below captured their attention. Beams of light flashed, and a group of grim-faced cultivators dressed in black appeared at the moonlight border of Tianquan Prefecture. They first bowed slightly to the Mirror Wielder in the sky, then, with solemn expressions, prepared their techniques and formations towards the still-unbroken Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation. It was as if they were about to launch a full-scale assault on the formation at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, various techniques were unleashed, but their expressions were as if time had been paused, frozen in mid-air. Purple lances like heavenly thunder, spatial rifts that writhed, and continuous yellow talismans… All were activated and then converged. Waiting for a gap to appear in the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation, they would erupt in unison. The black-clad cultivators of the Immortal Alliance took turns, transforming their internal power into techniques and condensing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After several hours, the black-clad cultivators rotated, and the accumulated techniques at the edge of the great formation reached a truly astonishing level. A flicker of solemnity crossed the Saint Emperor’s face. Undeniably, this suspended ball of light, if detonated on the surface of the Xuanhuang Realm, could easily turn several prefectures into ruins.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll go.” Tianyang was about to step forward to resolve this hidden danger when Li Ping stopped him. “Wait a little longer. I have a way to handle it,” Li Ping said in a deep voice. Tianyang nodded slightly, not daring to overexert himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Another half-day passed, and a total of over a thousand full-power attacks were channeled. The condensed mini light sphere was even more dazzling than the moon in the sky. Even the Mirror Wielder seemed to feel a hint of apprehension. An imprint on its forehead released a small bronze mirror, enveloping itself, nine Dissolution Discs, and other secondary phantom bodies. Within the Dissolution Discs, the light and shadow generated by analyzing the formation rapidly shifted, and feedback was finally received.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Occasionally, a strand of colored light escaped and floated towards Lu Xichan not far away. And as Lu Xichan comprehended the content of these strands, her body trembled, and she revealed an expression of entrancement. She then transmitted her insights to the formation masters present, which elicited waves of admiration. At this moment, looking at the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation before them, their eyes held no trace of despair. Led by Lu Xichan, the formation masters began to decipher the great formation. The moonlight, originally substantial and like a silver ribbon, began to become hazy under the influence of external forces.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor sensed that these Immortal Alliance formation masters were like small insects, constantly gnawing at the foundation of the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation. Admittedly, Li Ping could fine-tune the great formation. And he was confident that the speed of decryption by the twenty-eight combined Dissolution Discs would absolutely not match his speed of changing formations. If the Immortal Alliance did not employ any special methods, he could eternally trap them with formations alone. But… his goal was never merely to trap them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The arrangements made outside the Xuanhuang Realm informed him that the Star Sea was already in turmoil. The power of the Star Sea’s resurgence and the struggle with the residual immortal power were about to formally begin. The Saint Emperor, who had been seated throughout, slowly rose. In a single thought, his majestic figure was projected onto the Xuanhuang Celestial Curtain. As if cooperating, the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty, bright as the moon, suddenly dimmed slightly, yielding the stage to the Saint Emperor of Great Qi.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment Li Ping’s image appeared, the generals fighting in various prefectures of the Immortal Alliance felt their blood boil, their fighting spirit soaring. They shouted in unison, “All hail the Saint Emperor!” The deafening cheers echoed throughout the Xuanhuang Realm, unwavering. The captured and besieged cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance looked fearfully at the imposing figure that filled the entire sky, their minds involuntarily recalling legends of the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate. “At this moment, where is the Heavenly Venerate?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And those Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators still fighting a desperate battle, witnessing this figure that filled their vision, were all stunned into a daze. “In ancient times, the Dharma Transmitter attained enlightenment, transmitted it to all living beings, and established a glorious millennium of cultivation. However, the Dharma-Transmitting method goes against Heaven. Heaven and Earth nurture cultivators. Devouring Heaven and Earth is like patricide and matricide.” “It is not the righteous path.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">… The Saint Emperor’s voice echoed throughout the Xuanhuang Realm. Amplified by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, it clearly reached the ears of every living being. Initially, the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance did not react to what the Saint Emperor of Great Qi intended to do. But when they heard the phrase “not the righteous path,” their expressions drastically changed. The Mirror Wielder, who was overseeing the Dissolution Discs, had a grim expression. In the central four prefectures, lights flickered continuously; these were the high-ranking officials of the Immortal Alliance headquarters who had finally been provoked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Slandering the Dharma Transmitter was equivalent to slandering the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance. It shook the legitimacy and foundation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s rule. For the high-ranking officials of the Immortal Alliance, the consequences of this matter were even more severe than the loss of all their territories. After all, territories could be regained, but once the hearts of the people were lost… “Break the formation! Break the formation immediately!” Lu Xichan heard the furious roar of Transmitter Ren in her ear. The Immortal Alliance formation masters were silent as cicadas in winter, desperately trying to break the formation. However, while breaking the formation, they could not help but secretly listen to the voice from the heavens above.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Accompanied by various divine and auspicious phenomena appearing in the sky, the Saint Emperor’s words drifted to every corner of the Xuanhuang Realm. “I also possess a method, not relying on the power of Heaven and Earth, to tread the immortal path.” “It is, to establish my foundation, to achieve Primordial Golden Core, to form Nascent Soul, to transform Divine Essence…” “Star Sea Convergence of Dao…” “Resonating Dao for Longevity!” The Saint Emperor’s words struck the Xuanhuang Realm like a thunderclap, echoing between Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It had already captured the attention of all cultivators. After all, judging solely by its name, the Saint Emperor’s method seemed much superior to the Dharma Transmission method. Furthermore, with auspicious clouds and golden light filling the world, showing signs of good fortune, the cultivators were left in a state of reverie. The last time a supreme being preached the Dao in the Xuanhuang Realm was thousands of years ago, during the era of the Dharma-Transmitting Immortal Venerate. After the Dharma Transmission method was verified by the world, the Dharma-Transmitting Immortal Venerate, who was at the Dao Integration stage at the time, also became the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate of the Longevity stage. If this new method proved effective, would it not mean that the Xuanhuang Realm would have another peerless expert capable of rivaling the Dharma Transmitter?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Surrendering to a bandit of unknown origin might lead to retribution from the Myriad Immortals Alliance later. But if they joined the Saint Emperor… A strange atmosphere began to circulate among the Immortal Alliance cultivators. The Saint Emperor’s sermon continued. “The path to immortality, the first step, is to establish my foundation.” “Utilizing the wonders of Heaven and Earth, one can build a foundation. Why? Because the wonders of the world are the embodiment of laws.” “However, the greatest wonder in the world is not an object, but spirit.” “To establish my foundation, one must lay down the principles of all things in the world!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">… The seemingly profound method of establishing one’s foundation, when explained by the Saint Emperor, became simple and easy to understand. At this moment, even mortals in the Xuanhuang Realm who had not yet embarked on the path of cultivation could vaguely grasp the general idea. Not to mention those Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators who had already walked the path of Dharma Transmission. The Saint Emperor’s new method was actually built upon the foundation of the Dharma Transmission method, but broke through its shackles and underwent a transformation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance cultivators who practiced the Dharma Transmission method naturally felt an immense sense of familiarity. Even just by listening, thoughts of “So that’s how it is,” “It’s indeed feasible,” and “Marvelous” arose in their hearts, expressing their approval. Some cultivators who were at the peak of Qi Refining and were struggling to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, lamenting the lack of Foundation Establishment wonders, suddenly had an epiphany. It was as if they had been enlightened by divine revelation. “Why bother going through all the trouble to find wonders? The Saint Emperor is right, I am the wonder myself!” “Foundation Establishment! Foundation Establishment!” They immediately entered seclusion to comprehend the method.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While the method of establishing one’s foundation was not easy to cultivate in practice, the number of Qi Refining stage cultivators in the vast Xuanhuang Realm was the largest. With such a massive base, even with a small probability, the final result would still be tens of thousands! The Saint Emperor had only reached the middle chapter of Primordial Golden Core in his sermon, and new cultivators practicing the Foundation Establishment method had already begun to emerge throughout the Xuanhuang Realm! Unlike the breakthrough treatment of those practicing the Dharma Transmission method, after the new method cultivators broke through, the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth seemed to surge towards them spontaneously, as if they were the fated protagonists in legends, favored by the Heavenly Dao. Some even had auspicious clouds and golden light descending upon them during their breakthroughs, accompanied by celestial treasures, as if gifts from Heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The stark difference in Heaven and Earth’s attitude made it impossible for other cultivators not to feel envious. Cultivators at the Golden Core stage or above might have some reservations. However, for those at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages, abandoning their old cultivation and restarting carried no burden. After all, even if this Saint Emperor’s new method proved unworkable, as long as the Foundation Establishment wonders remained, they could always try again. After abandoning their cultivation, they could temporarily store the wonders and focus on practicing the Foundation Establishment method. The number of Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm far exceeded the sum of all other realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if only one out of ten chose the Saint Emperor’s new method, it would be a devastating blow to the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate and the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Apart from Transmitter Ren, other Dharma Transmitters could no longer sit idly by. Because the Immortal Alliance headquarters had already proven the feasibility of the Foundation Establishment method through experimentation. If they allowed the Saint Emperor to continue preaching… The high-ranking officials of the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not help but shudder.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Deep within the Immortal Alliance’s Nether Prison. In the deepest part of the spatial confinement holding thousands of heinous criminals. A figure that seemed to be nothing but bones, with limbs spread wide in a cruciform shape, was nailed to the void. Upon closer inspection, every bone in the figure seemed to be perpetually burned by flames, struck by lightning, and gnawed by strange insects… The suffering was indescribable, yet the figure seemed accustomed to it, its face peaceful. Or rather, on its skeletal face, no expression could be seen anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the endless suffering of its physical form caused the figure to slightly lift its head. Its eyes, completely black, pierced through the layers of the Nether Prison’s space and gazed towards the Xuanhuang Realm’s firmament. “Establish my foundation…” “Establish my foundation…” A wisp of black flame, like a black serpent, emerged from the void and flew directly towards it, instantly piercing its chest. The black flame passed through its heart, yet some of it lingered at the wound, burning the figure’s remaining flesh and bones… and even its residual soul. Even with the figure’s immense endurance, it could not help but let out a muffled groan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Establish my foundation, establish my foundation…” He continued to murmur, and tiny specks of starlight began to flicker within his black eye sockets. For a long time, besides suffering, no other sensation had appeared in his heart. But now, he dimly saw a glimmer of hope. A glimmer of hope for escape. How long had he been imprisoned? In the pitch-black Nether Prison, he had almost forgotten the concept of time. But judging by the injuries to his body, it must have been a full five hundred years. After being captured and imprisoned here, he had given up all hope of escape. After all, all his abilities had been drained by the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Even if he were to escape from here by some miracle, it would be difficult to find his way back under the pursuit of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. But now, perhaps through this voice reaching the depths of the Nether Prison, he might truly escape this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Every bit of pain is built upon my body.” “It is 【I】 who feels it.” “The source of the pain is 【I】.” “I establish my foundation…” Specks of golden light began to flicker as the figure spoke. These golden lights seemed to emanate from the figure’s remaining bones. Hidden all along, they were only ignited now in this desperate gamble. With creaking sounds, the golden light, like flames, baked the bones. The bones dissolved like candles, but after condensing, they formed a smaller body that had regained its normal shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding restrictions sensed the figure’s movement and constantly triggered chastisements, bombarding the figure. But the figure had long grown accustomed to it, even absorbing these punitive measures to condense the energy for its new body. Under the illumination of the golden light, the figure grew smaller and smaller. Eventually, it was only the size of an adult’s palm. Emerging from the original skeleton, “Establishing my foundation has actually returned me to my initial state of cultivation.” “It truly is an ultimate and profound method!” “Even if I was delayed in the High Walls for over five hundred years, it would still be worthwhile if I could bring this method back.” The tiny figure transformed into a beam of golden light and flew directly out from the deepest part of the Nether Prison. Ignoring all restrictions along the way. Even the jailers of the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s Nether Prison did not notice this escaping golden light. The golden light figure arrived on the ground, gazing at the Saint Emperor’s projection in the sky. “In desperate circumstances, true talents emerge. In five hundred years, another such figure has appeared in the world…” “Primordial Golden Core.” The tiny golden figure listened intently for a long time, its brow furrowed. “It’s a bit strange. Could it be that I’ve been imprisoned for too long and have become foolish?” “Regardless, I’ll record it first. Once I get out, there will be plenty of people to study it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">… The Great Qi Saint Emperor was naturally unaware that he had gained another listener from outside the High Walls. At this moment, his sermon was nearing its end, reaching the final stage of “Resonating Dao for Longevity.” “Beyond the Xuanhuang, above the Star Sea, lies the great Dao of proving immortality.” “True Immortals fall, the Dao is empty.” “Reversing the Dao’s shadow, the true meaning of resonating Dao, can glimpse the realm of longevity…” The Saint Emperor preached solemnly. Even the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao itself seemed to comprehend these profound and esoteric words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All the winds in the world stood still. The vast Xuanhuang Realm, apart from the voice of the Great Qi’s sermon, was utterly silent. Even the Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators, who had been eagerly trying to break the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation, were now all stunned, listening to the Saint Emperor’s words in a daze. The higher their realm and strength, the greater the shock they felt.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the Myriad Immortals Alliance Headquarters. Xu Ke and Yin Shangren, while pretending to visit and wander, suddenly sensed that the Museum of Divine Treasures seemed to have brightened slightly. The heavy feeling that had been suppressed in their hearts also suddenly disappeared. “Grandfather Sansheng has left,” Xu Ke immediately judged. “Shall we act now?” Yin Shangren was eager to try. “Let’s wait. Let’s wait for the Saint Emperor’s side…” “The breakthroughs of the Beast Taming Sect in recent years have even surprised me. They chose to go into seclusion at the time of the great calamity, preserving a large amount of talent. It was indeed useful,” Xu Ke said. “Okay, we can wait. It’s just a matter of time. By the way, let me show you this…” Yin Shangren pulled Xu Ke towards an exhibit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke looked closely and saw a golden tree with a peculiar shape. The leaves of the tree were all triangular, and the trunk was carved with small figures interacting in various poses. “This item isn’t an ancient artifact of the Xuanhuang Realm, is it?” Xu Ke said with a strange expression after observing it for a while. “Of course not. It comes from my hometown.” “Or rather, the part of my hometown where the residual consciousness is most complete,” Yin Shangren said leisurely. “I originally thought that place was completely gone, but I didn’t expect that the most important golden tree would be preserved in this Museum of Divine Treasures.” “This tree… is there anything special about it?” Xu Ke knew that Yin Shangren would not be sighing about past events for no reason, so he immediately asked, his heart stirred. Yin Shangren chuckled: “In my world, there is no sun or moon. The light of the entire world depends on this golden tree. Even the origin of all life originates from under this tree. You saw the carvings on the tree; they are the imprints of human interactions over the ages under the tree.” “Although the world was destroyed, as long as this tree exists, the power of the world’s origin is almost one-third preserved.” Xu Ke began to understand and then said with some surprise: “Do you have a way to detonate the energy within this tree?” Yin Shangren touched his scalp and smiled without replying. “Are you willing? That’s your hometown! If this tree is well-preserved, after the Saint Emperor conquers the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters, perhaps he can help recreate that world,” Xu Ke said. Yin Shangren snorted coldly: “Everyone is dead, what’s the point of recreating the world? Do you expect me to act as their stand-in and perform a solo play?” “Just detonate it.” Xu Ke responded with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the two were talking, they suddenly felt the ground beneath their feet tremble slightly. They looked at each other and simultaneously looked up towards the outside of the Museum of Divine Treasures. Although their vision could not penetrate, they could vaguely feel that a major change had occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm. Their senses were not wrong. At this moment, a wondrous scene was unfolding in the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm. The originally bright sky suddenly dimmed as if night had fallen. The sun in the sky disappeared. Points of starlight lit up from various places in the sky. Amidst the shining stars, a bright moon rose. However, the Xuanhuang cultivators soon discovered that this “moon” was even brighter than the original sun. As the giant jade plate slowly approached, the Xuanhuang Realm was illuminated once more. The cultivators looked up at the sky and saw that within the bright moon, magnificent pagodas were erected. It was clearly another world!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief moment of mental blankness, countless thoughts flooded the minds of the Xuanhuang cultivators. “Is this the legendary Xuanxianzhou?” “Has the Xuanxianzhou attacked?” “I heard the Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Council are at war, could it be a surprise attack by the Five Elders Council?” “Beware of vigilance!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">… When things are abnormal, there must be a demon. Now that they were in a state of wartime preparation, the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s reaction was swift. The defensive formations of the Celestial Cities in all prefectures were immediately activated, and alarms resounded through the sky. Even more cultivators transformed into beams of white light and shot straight towards the moon-like world in the sky, wanting to investigate. But even though it appeared close at hand, the investigating cultivator could never fly into it. It was as if there was a chasm between them. The Myriad Immortals Alliance stood ready, but saw several beams of bright light descend from the moon. The moonlight was like a knife, accurately striking the borders of the four central prefectures of the Immortal Alliance: Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, and Tianquan. The sky of the four central prefectures of the Immortal Alliance instantly became coated with a silver sheen, becoming illusory and hazy. But apart from that, there seemed to be no other anomalies. After cautiously waiting for a long time, the cultivators of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance concluded that there were no other anomalies. However, they soon realized they were wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The teleportation arrays are unusable! We’ve been sealed off!” “The communication spirit talismans can’t be used either!” “We’ve lost contact with other prefectures. However, we can still contact the Immortal Alliance headquarters.” “What did they say? To act according to the situation? Everyone is already at our doorstep! Damn it!” The four prefectures immediately descended into chaos. Some hot-tempered cultivators flew directly to the border of the prefectures covered by the silver light, trying to cross the blockade. The white mist barrier under the moonlight seemed to gain a touch of sacred solemnity. A cultivator, bracing himself, charged directly into the white mist. Although he had prepared for the possibility of his lifespan being shortened by several years, the scene he saw after entering the white mist left him dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he stepped out of the boundary, the white mist that had filled his vision instantly disappeared. It was replaced by an boundless starry sky. It was as if he had truly entered the void outside the Xuanhuang Realm, surrounded by darkness and coldness. In the distance, faint traces of countless brilliant stars could be seen, occasionally sparkling. The cultivator was stunned and wanted to return, but found that the path he came from had disappeared. He then thought it was an illusion and used sword techniques and magic spells one after another, but not a single ripple was stirred in the starry sky. Instantaneous teleportation techniques also failed. Conversely, as the spiritual power in his body was consumed, the surrounding cold starry sky environment began to erode his mind. Helpless, the cultivator could only choose a direction and fly continuously. He tried to leave the range of this starry sky. But they did not know that the star sea was boundless, and without the correct method, even if they spent a lifetime, they would not be able to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside the great formation, cultivators continuously stepped into the moonlight boundary. The great formation was like an endless abyss, swallowing all of them. Nascent Soul, God Transformation, even Dao Integration. Regardless of their cultivation level, as long as they entered, they would never return. After a period of probing, the cultivators of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance were finally deterred. The Immortal Alliance headquarters also finally issued an emergency order, prohibiting cultivators in the four prefectures from acting recklessly. Several beams of rainbow light traversed the prefectures and arrived at the moonlight boundary in Tianquan Prefecture. Among them was Lu Xichan, the Chief Formation Master of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. “This formation…” Lu Xichan examined the moonlight shining on the white mist barrier, her eyes filled with shock. A young man in white robes beside her frowned and asked, “When can we break this formation? We’ve lost contact with the prefectures outside the great formation.” “Not only are the teleportation arrays malfunctioning, but even the Heavenly Profound Mirror channels are blocked,” the young man in white robes said with some worry. This young man in white robes was one of the core Law Transmitters of the Immortal Alliance, Ren, the Law Transmitter. Lu Xichan dared not delay and replied: “This formation seems to be drawing the power of the Star Sea, and then using infinite spatial transformations to generate a starry sky that resembles the real one…” Dao Transmitter Ren coldly interrupted Lu Xichan: “When can we break the formation?” Lu Xichan’s voice abruptly stopped. After a long pause, she said, “The complexity of this formation is unprecedented in my life. It should take at least fifteen days…” Dao Transmitter Ren said coldly: “I will give you ten days.” With a cold snort, Dao Transmitter Ren flashed away. Only Lu Xichan and several other formation masters from the Immortal Alliance’s Formation Hall were left behind. Lu Xichan looked up at the great star formation covering the sky, and cold sweat gradually dripped from her forehead. The more profound the formation masters present were, the more despair filled their eyes. It was not that the Immortal Alliance’s formation masters were all useless. It was simply that the formation laid down by the Saint Emperor this time far surpassed the current era. Li Fan’s hundreds of reincarnations, with constant deductions using the TERMINAL DISSOLUTION DISC, accumulated array knowledge beyond several generations of Xuanhuang. Furthermore, it incorporated insights from Li Fan, or rather, the DISSOLUTION DISC, after obtaining several immortal-level formations. After being infused with these array essentials, the Saint Emperor, relying on his enlightenment in the Star Sea, further deduced the array to a deeper level. Currently, above the Celestial Cities of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance, covering almost half of the sky, was the bright moon, representing the Sacred Dynasty Da Qi. Countless citizens of Da Qi gathered in the Sacred Heart Hall. Facing the Saint Emperor’s statue, they knelt and prayed devoutly. In the Sacred Capital City, below the Saint Emperor’s throne. Tens of thousands of created second-generation Abyssal people chanted praises for the Saint Emperor’s great virtue. The Sacred Dynasty’s purple-gold aura mingled with the golden Origin Force essence. Forming a faint purple-gold starlight, it left the Sacred Dynasty’s territory and maintained the operation of the great formation that trapped the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance. This ultimate trapping formation, named the [Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation] by the Saint Emperor, was almost infinitely close to a true immortal-level formation. Li Ping believed that even a Law Transmitter would need some time to break it. As for the people in the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance who wanted to break the formation… They would have to ask him, the Heavenly Mandate Saint Emperor, whether he agreed or not. Li Ping sat on the Saint Emperor’s throne, his gaze spanning the boundaries between two worlds, falling upon the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance in the Xuanhuang Realm. The Saint Emperor’s throne, or rather, the entire Sacred Capital City, fell into profound silence due to the impending war. Mao Bao was still in its usual state, lazily sleeping on Li Ping’s shoulder. It seemed that besides Origin Force essence, nothing else could move it. Besides Mao Bao, a figure resembling a child of eight or nine years old also stood beside the Saint Emperor. Gazing intently at the Xuanhuang Realm below. It was Tianyang. At this moment, his puppet body had undergone earth-shattering changes after receiving massive infusions of Origin Force essence and combat memories of the Immortal Puppet [Ancestor]. Its appearance and physique had returned to its living form. In fact, it had truly been born with the aura of life. His strength was unfathomable, gazing at the Myriad Immortals Alliance, awaiting the arrival of his opponent. And below the Saint Emperor’s throne, Yi Jue Daoist of the Du’er Sect had brought out all the paper figures of his entire sect. The paper figures recreated the mountain gate of the Du’er Sect from that year on the spot. In the center of the buildings, a passage leading to an unknown destination seemed to have opened. Although Yi Jue Daoist himself did not enter, his eyes, protruding infinitely outwards, stretched deep into the passage. “Saint Emperor, please rest assured. If anything happens in the Xuanhuang Realm, this old Daoist will definitely see it,” Yi Jue Daoist said with a chuckle. Li Ping did not respond to Yi Jue. In fact, most of his gaze and attention were focused on the starry sky outside the Xuanhuang Realm. There, he had made thorough preparations. Waiting for the Heavenly Physician and the Law Transmitter to descend.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Luoyan Prefecture, when the Luoyan Celestial City was breached, most of the Sacred Dynasty soldiers had already transferred to other battlefields. Only a small number were left to guard. However, from the wilderness outside Luoyan Prefecture, a large group of cultivators suddenly emerged. They did not try to recapture Luoyan Celestial City, but after a surprise attack, they quickly withdrew.</p>

<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-308" class="calibre1">Chapter 1296: Preaching to Fight the Saint Emperor</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heavenly Venerate, you have returned."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Xichan, along with the formation masters present, first paused slightly upon hearing these words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, inevitably, intense fear surged into their hearts as they lowered their heads.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even their bodies trembled uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the formidable pressure of the Longevity Heavenly Venerate, who had dominated Xuanhuang for thousands of years and single-handedly created the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Dharma Transmitter Ren spoke, the Saint Emperor talismans affixed to the giant Dharma Transmitter statues across all prefectures of the Myriad Immortals Alliance suddenly stirred without wind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They fluttered continuously, as if they could be blown away at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The statues suppressed by the talismans seemed to come alive, emitting faint tremors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor talismans and the Dharma Transmitter statues emitted purple-gold starlight and white light, respectively.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two forces continuously clashed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The world of Xuanhuang shifted, and the heavens and earth changed color.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor also seemed to sense something, and while preaching the Dao, he inadvertently glanced upwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the profound principles of the Great Dao he was explaining did not stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His speaking speed, however, involuntarily quickened slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the anomalies of Xuanhuang's heavens and earth, some Immortal Alliance cultivators had already guessed what was happening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their faces turned pale, cold sweat beaded on their foreheads, and they could no longer focus on the Saint Emperor's sermon. Their bodies trembled uncontrollably from fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While other cultivators' eyes flickered, they gathered to listen to the Saint Emperor's teachings, inwardly praying that the Dharma Transmitter would return a little later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Transience of ancient and modern, principles of the Great Dao."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The method of transmitting the Dao cannot be tolerated by Xuanhuang."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have attained the Dao today and will attempt to change it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, the Saint Emperor's sermon approached its end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's gaze completely shifted from the masses below to the figure outside the Xuanhuang Realm in the starry sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He nodded slightly and suddenly vanished into the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without the Saint Emperor's protection, various anomalies descended upon Xuanhuang's heavens and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rolling dark clouds inexplicably formed, continuously shrouding the bright moon transformed by the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the ground, birds and beasts that had ventured out to listen to the Saint Emperor's sermon, as if startled, fled in disarray, rushing back to their nests for refuge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the plants and trees, in the increasingly violent winds, began to wither and shatter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thunderclaps erupted from the dark clouds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, torrential rain pounded the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With winds, rain, and thunder, the entire Xuanhuang Realm instantly transformed into a doomsday-like scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the Dharma Transmitter himself had not yet arrived, all living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm trembled under his shadow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those Immortal Alliance cultivators whose hearts had wavered from listening to the Saint Emperor's sermon suddenly felt as if a basin of cold water had been poured on their heads, dispelling their fervent emotions and bringing them back to their senses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What am I thinking! That is the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate! The Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate who has suppressed the Xuanhuang Realm with one hand for thousands of years! How could I possibly fantasize that the Saint... No, that these bandits would win?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Saint Emperor... Although the Saint Emperor is powerful, he will never be a match for the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate. Damn it, I must quickly forget this new method too."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heavenly Venerate above, please forgive my momentary bewitchment..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the Heavenly Venerate takes action, everything will be alright!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance cultivators, intimidated by the Dharma Transmitter's might, trembled in fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the Sacred Dynasty soldiers, due to the vast difference in their innate realms, also experienced a moment of terror.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But soon, their eyes regained their determination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some of them recalled what the Saint Emperor had told them before this expedition.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, someone shouted towards the sky, "The Sacred Dynasty will surely win, the Saint Emperor will surely win!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Initially, it was just scattered shouts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But soon, it spread like wildfire. Without any intentional command, all the Sacred Dynasty soldiers, as if connected by their hearts, roared in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their voices grew louder and louder, escalating from shouts to roars, and from roars to furious cries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sound of the Great Qi soldiers, like rolling waves, surged across the entire Xuanhuang Realm with the force of overturning mountains and seas.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if responding to their calls, the bright moon in the sky erupted with purple-gold light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It emerged from the boundless dark clouds once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuanhuang's swaying winds and rain actually showed signs of slowly subsiding amidst the thunderous roars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing the distant sounds, the Dharma Transmitter Ren sneered, "A dying struggle."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if in response to his words, in the central four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance, teleportation gates appeared one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Vast arrays of flying ships flew out from them, instantly filling the skies of the four prefectures.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the bows of these flying ships stood Dharma Transmitters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitters gazed up at the sky and bowed slightly towards the Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate outside the starry sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Xichan secretly observed this scene, inwardly amazed: "These should be the forces from the small worlds of the various Dharma Transmitters. Since Heavenly Venerate has already appeared, they naturally won't hide behind the scenes anymore."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Judging by the auras emanating from those flying ships, there are no lack of Harmonious Dao cultivators among them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The hidden strength of the Immortal Alliance is far greater than I imagined..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Lu Xichan pondered, a mocking voice suddenly came from the sky: "You're deploying the Dissolution Discs, along with nineteen secondary Heavenly Profound bodies, and after all this time, you still haven't broken a mere containment formation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your Formation Strategy Hall is truly getting worse with each generation. If Lu Xia knew, she would probably be angered back to life."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing her master's name and the ridicule directed at her, Lu Xichan felt a surge of anger. However, she recognized that the speaker was Dou, one of the Dharma Transmitters, so despite her anger, she did not show it at all. She merely lowered her head and said, "Your subordinate is incompetent."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Forget it, have your people step aside." With a casual remark from Dharma Transmitter Dou, a troop of young boys and girls nonchalantly floated down from the flying ships in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They first bowed slightly to the Mirror Wielders guarding the Dissolution Discs. After receiving the formation data analyzed by the Dissolution Discs so far, they began to break the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were thirty-six such young disciples.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their faces were devoid of any expression. There wasn't even the slightest emotional fluctuation in their eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of them extended his hand into the beam of light of the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, his body instantly became illusory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From his hand to his body, he gradually became like the starlight of the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Dao child testing the formation was about to be completely engulfed by the starlight, his figure suddenly disappeared and transformed into a stream of light, flying to another Dao child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This second Dao child also touched it with his hand and then tested the formation with his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This process repeated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until the thirty-sixth Dao child, just as he was about to transform into starlight,</p>
<p class="calibre2">His body trembled, shaking out all thirty predecessors. He himself returned to his normal appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The thirty-six Dao children huddled together, whispering and chattering amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as if reaching a consensus, they all nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They split into two groups. One group began to break the formation, while the other group repeated the process of testing the formation with their bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance formation masters observing from the side immediately sensed that these children were extraordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Judging by their speed of breaking the formation, the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation would absolutely be torn open within half a day at most.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the chief of the Formation Strategy Hall, Lu Xichan's shock far surpassed that of ordinary people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looked at these thirty-six formation-breaking children, and in her mind, she recalled four words: "Formation Spirit Sacred Body."</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was an extremely special physique, as if their bodies were naturally formed by formations. Not only did they have a natural sensitivity and affinity for various formations, but they could also merge with the formation, greatly increasing its strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like artifact spirits to magical treasures, they could transform into formation spirits, causing formations to sublimate and transform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Formation Spirit Sacred Body was a rare sight, appearing only once in a hundred years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Xichan's master, Lu Xia, had wished to find cultivators with this physique before his death to inherit his mantle. Unfortunately, he couldn't fulfill his wish until his death and had no choice but to pass on all his lifelong learning to Lu Xichan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She never expected that more than thirty of them would appear today!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Xichan looked up at the sky again, at the figures standing on the densely packed flying ships above.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She felt a slight chill in her heart: "How many secrets are these Dharma Transmitters hiding?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dharma Transmitter Ren, after understanding the progress of breaking the formation, couldn't help but flash a murderous intent in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Myriad Immortals Alliance had been put in such a plight this time, and Heavenly Venerate would surely not let him off the hook.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since that was the case, before receiving punishment, he would take out his anger on these troublemakers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a wave of his hand, the group of black-robed cultivators who had been concentrating their attacks and were forced to stop due to the Saint Emperor's sermon, began to act again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Several more cultivators dressed in green Daoist robes, holding whisks and talismans, descended silently from the flying ships.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the flick of their whisks and talismans, they molded the accumulated power within the light sphere into ferocious-looking divine-like figures radiating killing intent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These energy deities descended upon the world, and the might they exuded made Lu Xichan, a Harmonious Dao cultivator, feel genuine fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Myriad Immortals Alliance's counterattack was poised to strike.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation, the Sacred Dynasty soldiers were also prepared for a head-on collision with the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang, the overall commander of the eastern battlefield, was methodically issuing orders through the Saint Emperor's Star Network.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Those below the Nascent Soul stage are to remain in their positions and not move rashly. Continue to supervise the construction progress of the suppression formation. Remember, completing the formation on time is a great merit!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"For cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage and above, I will make the following deployment adjustments."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The brighter stars in the sea of stars rapidly dispersed and regrouped under the command of Sun Erlang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Do not engage the Myriad Immortals Alliance head-on. Extend the battle line to every corner of the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We do not need to attack the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters. What we need is to wait for the Saint Emperor to return victorious from the Star Sea!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang said with great determination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Great Qi soldiers responded with a roar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After everyone's emotions were stirred up, Sun Erlang observed the scene within the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation and made final adjustments to the appointments of the officers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, his mind, which still had spare capacity, connected with the silently standing dark gold Sacred Punishment Puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Finally, I can stretch my limbs."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under Sun Erlang's calm gaze, an extremely fervent fighting spirit surged forth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three hours later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After seven days of tightly sealing the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance, the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation was finally torn open by a small gap.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, powerful attacks filled with the wrath of the Immortal Alliance cultivators poured out from this gap.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Condensed magical techniques, manifested divine spirits with angry eyes, and countless magical treasures' lights...</p>
<p class="calibre2">They shone brilliantly, Erupting outwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The terrifying energy, capable of easily leveling several prefectures of the Immortal Alliance, was eagerly seeking targets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, what awaited the Myriad Immortals Alliance's accumulated counterattack was merely an ordinary dark gate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the dark gate opened, all the ferocious attacks were swallowed by it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a colossal beast of the abyss opening its bloody maw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not a single ripple of energy was left for the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After swallowing all the accumulated explosive energy, the dark gate disappeared as silently as it had appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It left the Myriad Immortals Alliance people in a state of stunned bewilderment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sea of Darkness?" Dharma Transmitter Ren's expression changed slightly. He sensed a familiar aura from this gate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And as he had predicted, this "colossal" energy swallowed by the Sea of Darkness only formed another accumulation cloud in the depths of the Sea of Darkness. Aside from that, no other ripples were made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems the anomalies in the Sea of Darkness a while ago were also related to these scoundrels."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Old grudges compounded with new ones, Dharma Transmitter Ren's heart was filled with extreme rage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The thirty-six Dao children continued to break the formation, aiming to completely tear open the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cultivators under the command of other Dharma Transmitters also poured out from the gap in the great formation, intending to clear out and annihilate the bandits in each prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Dharma Transmitter Ren's plan encountered setbacks in the very first prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The entire prefecture was empty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed the bandits had completely withdrawn, and even the Heavenly City's interior had been ransacked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not a single person was left behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They ran away?" Dharma Transmitter Ren was somewhat surprised and uncertain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While the Immortal Alliance cultivators were looking around in confusion, flashes of light appeared from various corners of the prefecture,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly striking towards them at high speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The silver light seemed to have received special augmentation, its speed several times faster than when they had teleported away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They arrived in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sky Patrol Arrows?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some Dharma Transmitters recognized the objects presented before them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their expressions changed drastically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the next moment...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous, violent explosions echoed through the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">And at this moment, outside the Xuanhuang Realm, in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The figure rapidly returning to the Xuanhuang Realm also suffered almost the same fate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, what was detonated in the Star Sea was not merely Sky Patrol Arrows.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, it was the residual True Immortal power scattered throughout the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Saint Emperor Li Ping was not an obstinate person who insisted on a head-on confrontation with the Dharma Transmitter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What he wanted was simply victory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using the "great wind" stirred up by the resurgence of the Star Sea, Li Ping utilized the power of the Star Sea's resurgence to alter the positions of the residual True Immortal powers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he used formations to conceal them, creating traps in a certain sense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This road back was one the Dharma Transmitter had traveled countless times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was intimately familiar with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he never expected to encounter an ambush this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like wind and waves rising, the figure became indistinct and distorted under the influence of the various True Immortal residues.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It appeared somewhat disheveled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor watched the opponent from afar. The figure's appearance was identical to the tall stone statues erected throughout Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Undoubtedly showcasing the opponent's identity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">High crown and long beard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this figure, even when attacked, maintained the same expressionless face as the stone statues on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor did not wait for the opponent to recover from the surprise attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Dynasty's projection behind him, accompanied by swirling starlight, instantly appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Destiny is with me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The ultimate Dao is with me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The future is with me!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Dynasty's accumulated destiny and luck were instantly bestowed upon him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The devout prayers of countless Da Qi citizens, soldiers, and the surviving You Clan, pierced through space and time, sounding like profound celestial music around the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, a fierce wind stirred around the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Darkness receded, and starlight gradually brightened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the Saint Emperor seemed to have become the center of the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Infinite star domains, endless void, countless stars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All revolved around the Saint Emperor at this moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm felt a sense of connection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They involuntarily looked up at the sky, beyond the overcast heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Brilliant silver swirling starlight illuminated the world, like nighttime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And amidst the swirling stars, the majestic and solemn figure of the Saint Emperor could be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His starlit imperial robe danced with the galaxy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shining brightly, dazzling endlessly!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao annihilation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao creation!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's figure, accompanied by calm and grand Daoistic pronouncements, vanished into the swirling starlight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Brilliant silver light instantly unfurled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a Milky Way, it descended from the nine heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It charged straight towards the high-crowned old man who had yet to stabilize his form!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter's eternally unchanging face finally showed a ripple of emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the boundless starlight, he seemed to behold the prosperous era of immortal cultivation in the Primordial Immortal Realm, and this Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also seemed to see the gradual emergence of discordant phenomena in the Star Sea as prosperity declined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also seemed to see, as the immortal path collapsed, all sorts of terrifying calamities silently descending upon the Star Sea, and one flourishing immortal cultivation realm after another perishing amidst the tribulation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter's gaze fluctuated. Before his eyes, the brilliant Star Sea was beginning to dim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Starlight entered his eyes, his body, his soul.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter's high crown and robes began to decay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter's beard and hair began to fall out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter's tall and majestic figure became hunched.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those residual True Immortal powers that had not yet fully detached continued to entangle him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate appeared precarious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Cough, cough..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What a move, [Dao Annihilation, Dao Creation]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the whistling wind of the Star Sea, the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate finally spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His voice, unlike the benevolent tone of his teachings remembered by the beings of Xuanhuang,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seemed to be due to the heavy blow, rendering him powerless and extremely weak, like a dying mortal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor did not respond.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He did not even show his figure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The impact and erosion of the river of starlight were nearing their end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Saint Emperor's move had not yet finished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What had just happened to the Dharma Transmitter was merely [Dao Annihilation].</p>
<p class="calibre2">And next...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was [Dao Creation]!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dark black hair emerged from the Dharma Transmitter's head and grew rapidly in the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With muffled thuds, sounds of flesh and bone bulging outwards could be heard from various parts of the Dharma Transmitter's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Intense heartbeats accompanied the reviving wind of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With every heartbeat, a piece of flesh burst from the Dharma Transmitter's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The new Dao is born, the old law must be executed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter, an ancient being incompatible with the resurgence of the Star Sea, was undergoing intense Dao devouring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The heartbeats grew faster and faster, the Dharma Transmitter's contorted body was already incomplete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even his bones had vanished beneath the flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a broken puzzle piece, it drifted amidst the violent explosions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His newly grown hair circled the Star Sea once before returning to its original place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It fiercely strangled his neck.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tightening and tightening, as if a sharp sword was determined to sever his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bang!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The heartbeat reached its limit, and the Dharma Transmitter's chest exploded with a deafening sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no mist of blood, only pure, absolute void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not even energy remained, a complete sign of Dao annihilation!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dao annihilation spread from the void in his chest, creeping outwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His already broken body seemed on the verge of being completely devoured by the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wind of the Star Sea grew more violent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if celebrating this victory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the void of Dao annihilation was about to engulf the Dharma Transmitter's head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate, this mysterious and extremely powerful being who had suppressed the Xuanhuang Realm for several eras.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Specks of starlight suddenly lit up in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the lower half of his head had already been devoured, there was still a voice that echoed in the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was precisely the same words the Saint Emperor had shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao annihilation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Following the Dharma Transmitter's words, the Star Sea seemed to fall into silence and darkness once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The whistling wind gradually subsided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wildly growing hair slowly fell off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The void that was devouring the Dharma Transmitter was also stopped by some power, its spread halted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, in just an instant, all the destructive phenomena on the Dharma Transmitter disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if an invisible barrier existed around him, preventing any approaching power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wind still blew, and the starlight still shone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it could not harm him in the slightest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though only the upper half of his head remained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao creation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter spoke again, his voice calm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Black hair reappeared, and flesh and blood regenerated from the void, evolving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His high crown and robes were all restored in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In just a moment, the previously heavily injured and near-death Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate had actually recovered completely!</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a terrifying sight this was!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What a pity, just a little bit more." The Saint Emperor's sigh suddenly echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A beam of starlight swept past, and Li Ping's figure reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He stared at the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate, the regret in his eyes long gone, replaced by infinite fighting spirit and unwavering faith.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter did not immediately counterattack but insteadsize-d the attacker who had tried to kill him without warning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if he had seen something extremely interesting, the Dharma Transmitter first paused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then he said, "When did this Star Sea gain another expert at the [Supreme] realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a hint of emotion and感慨, he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Supreme..." The Saint Emperor savored the two words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then he shook his head slightly: "It's just the current limit of this Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not the limit of this Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How can one speak of Supreme?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter did not refute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, he looked back towards the center of the distant Star Sea: "Fellow Daoist, do you know the saying 'when the tide rises, the boat floats'?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"My Supreme, and your Supreme..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Are still somewhat different."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter spoke plainly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no boasting in his words, only the calmness of stating facts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor listened to the Dharma Transmitter's words and fell into contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He naturally understood the Dharma Transmitter's meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The current combat power displayed by the Dharma Transmitter was limited by the maximum capacity of the Star Sea. However, the power the Dharma Transmitter could control was still above this limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But due to the current ceiling, it could not be revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once the Star Sea's limit was broken, his strength would continue to grow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the Saint Emperor, although he had also reached the current limit of the Star Sea,</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was with the blessings of the Sacred Dynasty's destiny, the Star Sea's favor, and various other factors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once the Star Sea's limit was broken, he would still need some time to cultivate to catch up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the gap between the Dharma Transmitter and himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"After all, he is a Dharma Transmitter who has lived for who knows how long." The Saint Emperor's heart held no surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nor was there any fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though his killing move was blocked, and there was a gap in their strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's attack had only just begun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Saint Emperor Li Ping reached out his hand forward, sensing the wind rising in the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, it was not the wind of the Star Sea's resurgence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the chaotic wind gradually rising from the conflict with the residual True Immortal powers!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate also sensed the Saint Emperor's actions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, your previous move [Dao Annihilation, Dao Creation] was indeed extraordinary."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It triggered my emotions and benefited me greatly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I also have a move. Please, fellow Daoist, sample it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the first time, the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate attacked first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This technique is called..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Object in Hand."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the three words "Object in Hand" echoed in the Saint Emperor's ears, a sense of unease surged in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the scene before his eyes rapidly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His body instantly began to shrink infinitely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding scenery rapidly magnified.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high-crowned old man, who was originally smaller than his three-zhang-three-cun body, rapidly grew.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the Saint Emperor realized what was happening, the Dharma Transmitter had already become as colossal as the magnificent stone statues erected on the surface of Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not just a change in size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor even felt that his connection with the Sacred Dynasty, with Xuanhuang, and even with the entire Star Sea was continuously weakening as he shrank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor had a vague premonition that if this continued, their connection might be completely severed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And he would be eternally lost in this miniaturized scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his thoughts raced, the Dharma Transmitter's attack had already arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the time it took to merely think, the Dharma Transmitter's full form could no longer be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only the Dharma Transmitter's palm, like a mountain, like the earth, like the heavens, pressed down from above.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding space was locked, and the Saint Emperor could not escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking up, even the patterns on the Dharma Transmitter's palm resembled continuous mountains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing the Dharma Transmitter's colossal palm about to descend, the Saint Emperor's eyes held no trace of fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang Realm..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is it truly your possession?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A cold glint flashed in the Saint Emperor's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let me show you the true power of Xuanhuang."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Body Manifestation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang Heaven!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">His body was completely engulfed by the Dharma Transmitter's colossal palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Infinite Xuanhuang light shone from beneath the colossal palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the beings of the Xuanhuang Realm instantly felt the ground beneath their feet shaking violently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dark clouds in the sky were also scattered by this tremor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What's more, many keen-eyed cultivators saw as if some lines were missing between heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With creaking sounds, as if celestial pillars were breaking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sky of the Xuanhuang Realm seemed to have fallen a little.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-309" class="calibre1">Chapter 1297: Holy Transmission United Against a Common Enemy</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heavenly Dao Resonance… The Saint Emperor contemplated, sensing the surging energy within Tianyang’s remains. After a long silence, he let out a sigh. “The Dao can prove immortality, but it does not align with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor’s tone held little regret as he withdrew from Tianyang’s armor state. Returning the remains, Li Ping instructed Tianyang, “The Dao of Strife is empty, but this resonant relic is undoubtedly a rare treasure for you. Contemplate it further. Although immortal paths are not apparent now, the resonance exists, proving the Dao still endures.” “Perhaps, in time, you might truly achieve the True Immortal realm through this!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Daoist Yijue of the Du’er Sect watched enviously as Tianyang put away the remains, then retreated back into the passage with his elongated eyeballs. “A pity, a pity…” Daoist Yijue lamented.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What profound insights does the Sect Master of the Du’er Sect have?” Tianyang, however, was not provoked by the Du’er Sect’s taunts this time. Yijue shook his head, chuckling, “Merely lamenting that the Du’er Sect missed a rare opportunity. As the saying goes, ‘When one person achieves the Dao, their chickens and dogs ascend.’ If His Excellency the Saint Emperor contemplates this remnant knowledge, perhaps one day he will truly attain the Great Dao. We too might benefit.” “As for you…” “Perhaps there will be such a day. But our Du’er Sect will likely not live to see it.” His words unabanshly conveyed his pessimistic outlook on Tianyang’s potential to achieve immortality.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, however, Tianyang was not angered by the Du’er Sect’s provocation. He merely sensed the unyielding thoughts within his remains, reminiscent of his human form. But perhaps due to his current state as a puppet, after much effort, Tianyang still could not rekindle the fervor in his heart. “Tianyang’s life, never inferior to others.” The words, when spoken, felt different than before.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A moment of silence descended upon the Saint Emperor’s throne hall. However, it wasn’t long before the commotion from the Myriad Immortals Alliance below captured their attention. Beams of light flashed, and a group of grim-faced cultivators dressed in black appeared at the moonlight border of Tianquan Prefecture. They first bowed slightly to the Mirror Wielder in the sky, then, with solemn expressions, prepared their techniques and formations towards the still-unbroken Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation. It was as if they were about to launch a full-scale assault on the formation at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, various techniques were unleashed, but their expressions were as if time had been paused, frozen in mid-air. Purple lances like heavenly thunder, spatial rifts that writhed, and continuous yellow talismans… All were activated and then converged. Waiting for a gap to appear in the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation, they would erupt in unison. The black-clad cultivators of the Immortal Alliance took turns, transforming their internal power into techniques and condensing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After several hours, the black-clad cultivators rotated, and the accumulated techniques at the edge of the great formation reached a truly astonishing level. A flicker of solemnity crossed the Saint Emperor’s face. Undeniably, this suspended ball of light, if detonated on the surface of the Xuanhuang Realm, could easily turn several prefectures into ruins.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll go.” Tianyang was about to step forward to resolve this hidden danger when Li Ping stopped him. “Wait a little longer. I have a way to handle it,” Li Ping said in a deep voice. Tianyang nodded slightly, not daring to overexert himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Another half-day passed, and a total of over a thousand full-power attacks were channeled. The condensed mini light sphere was even more dazzling than the moon in the sky. Even the Mirror Wielder seemed to feel a hint of apprehension. An imprint on its forehead released a small bronze mirror, enveloping itself, nine Dissolution Discs, and other secondary phantom bodies. Within the Dissolution Discs, the light and shadow generated by analyzing the formation rapidly shifted, and feedback was finally received.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Occasionally, a strand of colored light escaped and floated towards Lu Xichan not far away. And as Lu Xichan comprehended the content of these strands, her body trembled, and she revealed an expression of entrancement. She then transmitted her insights to the formation masters present, which elicited waves of admiration. At this moment, looking at the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation before them, their eyes held no trace of despair. Led by Lu Xichan, the formation masters began to decipher the great formation. The moonlight, originally substantial and like a silver ribbon, began to become hazy under the influence of external forces.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor sensed that these Immortal Alliance formation masters were like small insects, constantly gnawing at the foundation of the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation. Admittedly, Li Ping could fine-tune the great formation. And he was confident that the speed of decryption by the twenty-eight combined Dissolution Discs would absolutely not match his speed of changing formations. If the Immortal Alliance did not employ any special methods, he could eternally trap them with formations alone. But… his goal was never merely to trap them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The arrangements made outside the Xuanhuang Realm informed him that the Star Sea was already in turmoil. The power of the Star Sea’s resurgence and the struggle with the residual immortal power were about to formally begin. The Saint Emperor, who had been seated throughout, slowly rose. In a single thought, his majestic figure was projected onto the Xuanhuang Celestial Curtain. As if cooperating, the Great Qi Sacred Dynasty, bright as the moon, suddenly dimmed slightly, yielding the stage to the Saint Emperor of Great Qi.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment Li Ping’s image appeared, the generals fighting in various prefectures of the Immortal Alliance felt their blood boil, their fighting spirit soaring. They shouted in unison, “All hail the Saint Emperor!” The deafening cheers echoed throughout the Xuanhuang Realm, unwavering. The captured and besieged cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance looked fearfully at the imposing figure that filled the entire sky, their minds involuntarily recalling legends of the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate. “At this moment, where is the Heavenly Venerate?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And those Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators still fighting a desperate battle, witnessing this figure that filled their vision, were all stunned into a daze. “In ancient times, the Dharma Transmitter attained enlightenment, transmitted it to all living beings, and established a glorious millennium of cultivation. However, the Dharma-Transmitting method goes against Heaven. Heaven and Earth nurture cultivators. Devouring Heaven and Earth is like patricide and matricide.” “It is not the righteous path.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">… The Saint Emperor’s voice echoed throughout the Xuanhuang Realm. Amplified by the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, it clearly reached the ears of every living being. Initially, the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance did not react to what the Saint Emperor of Great Qi intended to do. But when they heard the phrase “not the righteous path,” their expressions drastically changed. The Mirror Wielder, who was overseeing the Dissolution Discs, had a grim expression. In the central four prefectures, lights flickered continuously; these were the high-ranking officials of the Immortal Alliance headquarters who had finally been provoked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Slandering the Dharma Transmitter was equivalent to slandering the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance. It shook the legitimacy and foundation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s rule. For the high-ranking officials of the Immortal Alliance, the consequences of this matter were even more severe than the loss of all their territories. After all, territories could be regained, but once the hearts of the people were lost… “Break the formation! Break the formation immediately!” Lu Xichan heard the furious roar of Transmitter Ren in her ear. The Immortal Alliance formation masters were silent as cicadas in winter, desperately trying to break the formation. However, while breaking the formation, they could not help but secretly listen to the voice from the heavens above.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Accompanied by various divine and auspicious phenomena appearing in the sky, the Saint Emperor’s words drifted to every corner of the Xuanhuang Realm. “I also possess a method, not relying on the power of Heaven and Earth, to tread the immortal path.” “It is, to establish my foundation, to achieve Primordial Golden Core, to form Nascent Soul, to transform Divine Essence…” “Star Sea Convergence of Dao…” “Resonating Dao for Longevity!” The Saint Emperor’s words struck the Xuanhuang Realm like a thunderclap, echoing between Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It had already captured the attention of all cultivators. After all, judging solely by its name, the Saint Emperor’s method seemed much superior to the Dharma Transmission method. Furthermore, with auspicious clouds and golden light filling the world, showing signs of good fortune, the cultivators were left in a state of reverie. The last time a supreme being preached the Dao in the Xuanhuang Realm was thousands of years ago, during the era of the Dharma-Transmitting Immortal Venerate. After the Dharma Transmission method was verified by the world, the Dharma-Transmitting Immortal Venerate, who was at the Dao Integration stage at the time, also became the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate of the Longevity stage. If this new method proved effective, would it not mean that the Xuanhuang Realm would have another peerless expert capable of rivaling the Dharma Transmitter?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Surrendering to a bandit of unknown origin might lead to retribution from the Myriad Immortals Alliance later. But if they joined the Saint Emperor… A strange atmosphere began to circulate among the Immortal Alliance cultivators. The Saint Emperor’s sermon continued. “The path to immortality, the first step, is to establish my foundation.” “Utilizing the wonders of Heaven and Earth, one can build a foundation. Why? Because the wonders of the world are the embodiment of laws.” “However, the greatest wonder in the world is not an object, but spirit.” “To establish my foundation, one must lay down the principles of all things in the world!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">… The seemingly profound method of establishing one’s foundation, when explained by the Saint Emperor, became simple and easy to understand. At this moment, even mortals in the Xuanhuang Realm who had not yet embarked on the path of cultivation could vaguely grasp the general idea. Not to mention those Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators who had already walked the path of Dharma Transmission. The Saint Emperor’s new method was actually built upon the foundation of the Dharma Transmission method, but broke through its shackles and underwent a transformation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Alliance cultivators who practiced the Dharma Transmission method naturally felt an immense sense of familiarity. Even just by listening, thoughts of “So that’s how it is,” “It’s indeed feasible,” and “Marvelous” arose in their hearts, expressing their approval. Some cultivators who were at the peak of Qi Refining and were struggling to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, lamenting the lack of Foundation Establishment wonders, suddenly had an epiphany. It was as if they had been enlightened by divine revelation. “Why bother going through all the trouble to find wonders? The Saint Emperor is right, I am the wonder myself!” “Foundation Establishment! Foundation Establishment!” They immediately entered seclusion to comprehend the method.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While the method of establishing one’s foundation was not easy to cultivate in practice, the number of Qi Refining stage cultivators in the vast Xuanhuang Realm was the largest. With such a massive base, even with a small probability, the final result would still be tens of thousands! The Saint Emperor had only reached the middle chapter of Primordial Golden Core in his sermon, and new cultivators practicing the Foundation Establishment method had already begun to emerge throughout the Xuanhuang Realm! Unlike the breakthrough treatment of those practicing the Dharma Transmission method, after the new method cultivators broke through, the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth seemed to surge towards them spontaneously, as if they were the fated protagonists in legends, favored by the Heavenly Dao. Some even had auspicious clouds and golden light descending upon them during their breakthroughs, accompanied by celestial treasures, as if gifts from Heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The stark difference in Heaven and Earth’s attitude made it impossible for other cultivators not to feel envious. Cultivators at the Golden Core stage or above might have some reservations. However, for those at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages, abandoning their old cultivation and restarting carried no burden. After all, even if this Saint Emperor’s new method proved unworkable, as long as the Foundation Establishment wonders remained, they could always try again. After abandoning their cultivation, they could temporarily store the wonders and focus on practicing the Foundation Establishment method. The number of Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm far exceeded the sum of all other realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if only one out of ten chose the Saint Emperor’s new method, it would be a devastating blow to the Dharma-Transmitting Heavenly Venerate and the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Apart from Transmitter Ren, other Dharma Transmitters could no longer sit idly by. Because the Immortal Alliance headquarters had already proven the feasibility of the Foundation Establishment method through experimentation. If they allowed the Saint Emperor to continue preaching… The high-ranking officials of the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not help but shudder.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Deep within the Immortal Alliance’s Nether Prison. In the deepest part of the spatial confinement holding thousands of heinous criminals. A figure that seemed to be nothing but bones, with limbs spread wide in a cruciform shape, was nailed to the void. Upon closer inspection, every bone in the figure seemed to be perpetually burned by flames, struck by lightning, and gnawed by strange insects… The suffering was indescribable, yet the figure seemed accustomed to it, its face peaceful. Or rather, on its skeletal face, no expression could be seen anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the endless suffering of its physical form caused the figure to slightly lift its head. Its eyes, completely black, pierced through the layers of the Nether Prison’s space and gazed towards the Xuanhuang Realm’s firmament. “Establish my foundation…” “Establish my foundation…” A wisp of black flame, like a black serpent, emerged from the void and flew directly towards it, instantly piercing its chest. The black flame passed through its heart, yet some of it lingered at the wound, burning the figure’s remaining flesh and bones… and even its residual soul. Even with the figure’s immense endurance, it could not help but let out a muffled groan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Establish my foundation, establish my foundation…” He continued to murmur, and tiny specks of starlight began to flicker within his black eye sockets. For a long time, besides suffering, no other sensation had appeared in his heart. But now, he dimly saw a glimmer of hope. A glimmer of hope for escape. How long had he been imprisoned? In the pitch-black Nether Prison, he had almost forgotten the concept of time. But judging by the injuries to his body, it must have been a full five hundred years. After being captured and imprisoned here, he had given up all hope of escape. After all, all his abilities had been drained by the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Even if he were to escape from here by some miracle, it would be difficult to find his way back under the pursuit of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. But now, perhaps through this voice reaching the depths of the Nether Prison, he might truly escape this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Every bit of pain is built upon my body.” “It is 【I】 who feels it.” “The source of the pain is 【I】.” “I establish my foundation…” Specks of golden light began to flicker as the figure spoke. These golden lights seemed to emanate from the figure’s remaining bones. Hidden all along, they were only ignited now in this desperate gamble. With creaking sounds, the golden light, like flames, baked the bones. The bones dissolved like candles, but after condensing, they formed a smaller body that had regained its normal shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding restrictions sensed the figure’s movement and constantly triggered chastisements, bombarding the figure. But the figure had long grown accustomed to it, even absorbing these punitive measures to condense the energy for its new body. Under the illumination of the golden light, the figure grew smaller and smaller. Eventually, it was only the size of an adult’s palm. Emerging from the original skeleton, “Establishing my foundation has actually returned me to my initial state of cultivation.” “It truly is an ultimate and profound method!” “Even if I was delayed in the High Walls for over five hundred years, it would still be worthwhile if I could bring this method back.” The tiny figure transformed into a beam of golden light and flew directly out from the deepest part of the Nether Prison. Ignoring all restrictions along the way. Even the jailers of the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s Nether Prison did not notice this escaping golden light. The golden light figure arrived on the ground, gazing at the Saint Emperor’s projection in the sky. “In desperate circumstances, true talents emerge. In five hundred years, another such figure has appeared in the world…” “Primordial Golden Core.” The tiny golden figure listened intently for a long time, its brow furrowed. “It’s a bit strange. Could it be that I’ve been imprisoned for too long and have become foolish?” “Regardless, I’ll record it first. Once I get out, there will be plenty of people to study it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">… The Great Qi Saint Emperor was naturally unaware that he had gained another listener from outside the High Walls. At this moment, his sermon was nearing its end, reaching the final stage of “Resonating Dao for Longevity.” “Beyond the Xuanhuang, above the Star Sea, lies the great Dao of proving immortality.” “True Immortals fall, the Dao is empty.” “Reversing the Dao’s shadow, the true meaning of resonating Dao, can glimpse the realm of longevity…” The Saint Emperor preached solemnly. Even the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao itself seemed to comprehend these profound and esoteric words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All the winds in the world stood still. The vast Xuanhuang Realm, apart from the voice of the Great Qi’s sermon, was utterly silent. Even the Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators, who had been eagerly trying to break the Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation, were now all stunned, listening to the Saint Emperor’s words in a daze. The higher their realm and strength, the greater the shock they felt.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the Myriad Immortals Alliance Headquarters. Xu Ke and Yin Shangren, while pretending to visit and wander, suddenly sensed that the Museum of Divine Treasures seemed to have brightened slightly. The heavy feeling that had been suppressed in their hearts also suddenly disappeared. “Grandfather Sansheng has left,” Xu Ke immediately judged. “Shall we act now?” Yin Shangren was eager to try. “Let’s wait. Let’s wait for the Saint Emperor’s side…” “The breakthroughs of the Beast Taming Sect in recent years have even surprised me. They chose to go into seclusion at the time of the great calamity, preserving a large amount of talent. It was indeed useful,” Xu Ke said. “Okay, we can wait. It’s just a matter of time. By the way, let me show you this…” Yin Shangren pulled Xu Ke towards an exhibit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke looked closely and saw a golden tree with a peculiar shape. The leaves of the tree were all triangular, and the trunk was carved with small figures interacting in various poses. “This item isn’t an ancient artifact of the Xuanhuang Realm, is it?” Xu Ke said with a strange expression after observing it for a while. “Of course not. It comes from my hometown.” “Or rather, the part of my hometown where the residual consciousness is most complete,” Yin Shangren said leisurely. “I originally thought that place was completely gone, but I didn’t expect that the most important golden tree would be preserved in this Museum of Divine Treasures.” “This tree… is there anything special about it?” Xu Ke knew that Yin Shangren would not be sighing about past events for no reason, so he immediately asked, his heart stirred. Yin Shangren chuckled: “In my world, there is no sun or moon. The light of the entire world depends on this golden tree. Even the origin of all life originates from under this tree. You saw the carvings on the tree; they are the imprints of human interactions over the ages under the tree.” “Although the world was destroyed, as long as this tree exists, the power of the world’s origin is almost one-third preserved.” Xu Ke began to understand and then said with some surprise: “Do you have a way to detonate the energy within this tree?” Yin Shangren touched his scalp and smiled without replying. “Are you willing? That’s your hometown! If this tree is well-preserved, after the Saint Emperor conquers the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters, perhaps he can help recreate that world,” Xu Ke said. Yin Shangren snorted coldly: “Everyone is dead, what’s the point of recreating the world? Do you expect me to act as their stand-in and perform a solo play?” “Just detonate it.” Xu Ke responded with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the two were talking, they suddenly felt the ground beneath their feet tremble slightly. They looked at each other and simultaneously looked up towards the outside of the Museum of Divine Treasures. Although their vision could not penetrate, they could vaguely feel that a major change had occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm. Their senses were not wrong. At this moment, a wondrous scene was unfolding in the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm. The originally bright sky suddenly dimmed as if night had fallen. The sun in the sky disappeared. Points of starlight lit up from various places in the sky. Amidst the shining stars, a bright moon rose. However, the Xuanhuang cultivators soon discovered that this “moon” was even brighter than the original sun. As the giant jade plate slowly approached, the Xuanhuang Realm was illuminated once more. The cultivators looked up at the sky and saw that within the bright moon, magnificent pagodas were erected. It was clearly another world!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief moment of mental blankness, countless thoughts flooded the minds of the Xuanhuang cultivators. “Is this the legendary Xuanxianzhou?” “Has the Xuanxianzhou attacked?” “I heard the Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Council are at war, could it be a surprise attack by the Five Elders Council?” “Beware of vigilance!”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">… When things are abnormal, there must be a demon. Now that they were in a state of wartime preparation, the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s reaction was swift. The defensive formations of the Celestial Cities in all prefectures were immediately activated, and alarms resounded through the sky. Even more cultivators transformed into beams of white light and shot straight towards the moon-like world in the sky, wanting to investigate. But even though it appeared close at hand, the investigating cultivator could never fly into it. It was as if there was a chasm between them. The Myriad Immortals Alliance stood ready, but saw several beams of bright light descend from the moon. The moonlight was like a knife, accurately striking the borders of the four central prefectures of the Immortal Alliance: Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, and Tianquan. The sky of the four central prefectures of the Immortal Alliance instantly became coated with a silver sheen, becoming illusory and hazy. But apart from that, there seemed to be no other anomalies. After cautiously waiting for a long time, the cultivators of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance concluded that there were no other anomalies. However, they soon realized they were wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The teleportation arrays are unusable! We’ve been sealed off!” “The communication spirit talismans can’t be used either!” “We’ve lost contact with other prefectures. However, we can still contact the Immortal Alliance headquarters.” “What did they say? To act according to the situation? Everyone is already at our doorstep! Damn it!” The four prefectures immediately descended into chaos. Some hot-tempered cultivators flew directly to the border of the prefectures covered by the silver light, trying to cross the blockade. The white mist barrier under the moonlight seemed to gain a touch of sacred solemnity. A cultivator, bracing himself, charged directly into the white mist. Although he had prepared for the possibility of his lifespan being shortened by several years, the scene he saw after entering the white mist left him dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he stepped out of the boundary, the white mist that had filled his vision instantly disappeared. It was replaced by an boundless starry sky. It was as if he had truly entered the void outside the Xuanhuang Realm, surrounded by darkness and coldness. In the distance, faint traces of countless brilliant stars could be seen, occasionally sparkling. The cultivator was stunned and wanted to return, but found that the path he came from had disappeared. He then thought it was an illusion and used sword techniques and magic spells one after another, but not a single ripple was stirred in the starry sky. Instantaneous teleportation techniques also failed. Conversely, as the spiritual power in his body was consumed, the surrounding cold starry sky environment began to erode his mind. Helpless, the cultivator could only choose a direction and fly continuously. He tried to leave the range of this starry sky. But they did not know that the star sea was boundless, and without the correct method, even if they spent a lifetime, they would not be able to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside the great formation, cultivators continuously stepped into the moonlight boundary. The great formation was like an endless abyss, swallowing all of them. Nascent Soul, God Transformation, even Dao Integration. Regardless of their cultivation level, as long as they entered, they would never return. After a period of probing, the cultivators of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance were finally deterred. The Immortal Alliance headquarters also finally issued an emergency order, prohibiting cultivators in the four prefectures from acting recklessly. Several beams of rainbow light traversed the prefectures and arrived at the moonlight boundary in Tianquan Prefecture. Among them was Lu Xichan, the Chief Formation Master of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. “This formation…” Lu Xichan examined the moonlight shining on the white mist barrier, her eyes filled with shock. A young man in white robes beside her frowned and asked, “When can we break this formation? We’ve lost contact with the prefectures outside the great formation.” “Not only are the teleportation arrays malfunctioning, but even the Heavenly Profound Mirror channels are blocked,” the young man in white robes said with some worry. This young man in white robes was one of the core Law Transmitters of the Immortal Alliance, Ren, the Law Transmitter. Lu Xichan dared not delay and replied: “This formation seems to be drawing the power of the Star Sea, and then using infinite spatial transformations to generate a starry sky that resembles the real one…” Dao Transmitter Ren coldly interrupted Lu Xichan: “When can we break the formation?” Lu Xichan’s voice abruptly stopped. After a long pause, she said, “The complexity of this formation is unprecedented in my life. It should take at least fifteen days…” Dao Transmitter Ren said coldly: “I will give you ten days.” With a cold snort, Dao Transmitter Ren flashed away. Only Lu Xichan and several other formation masters from the Immortal Alliance’s Formation Hall were left behind. Lu Xichan looked up at the great star formation covering the sky, and cold sweat gradually dripped from her forehead. The more profound the formation masters present were, the more despair filled their eyes. It was not that the Immortal Alliance’s formation masters were all useless. It was simply that the formation laid down by the Saint Emperor this time far surpassed the current era. Li Fan’s hundreds of reincarnations, with constant deductions using the TERMINAL DISSOLUTION DISC, accumulated array knowledge beyond several generations of Xuanhuang. Furthermore, it incorporated insights from Li Fan, or rather, the DISSOLUTION DISC, after obtaining several immortal-level formations. After being infused with these array essentials, the Saint Emperor, relying on his enlightenment in the Star Sea, further deduced the array to a deeper level. Currently, above the Celestial Cities of the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance, covering almost half of the sky, was the bright moon, representing the Sacred Dynasty Da Qi. Countless citizens of Da Qi gathered in the Sacred Heart Hall. Facing the Saint Emperor’s statue, they knelt and prayed devoutly. In the Sacred Capital City, below the Saint Emperor’s throne. Tens of thousands of created second-generation Abyssal people chanted praises for the Saint Emperor’s great virtue. The Sacred Dynasty’s purple-gold aura mingled with the golden Origin Force essence. Forming a faint purple-gold starlight, it left the Sacred Dynasty’s territory and maintained the operation of the great formation that trapped the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance. This ultimate trapping formation, named the [Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation] by the Saint Emperor, was almost infinitely close to a true immortal-level formation. Li Ping believed that even a Law Transmitter would need some time to break it. As for the people in the four prefectures of the Immortal Alliance who wanted to break the formation… They would have to ask him, the Heavenly Mandate Saint Emperor, whether he agreed or not. Li Ping sat on the Saint Emperor’s throne, his gaze spanning the boundaries between two worlds, falling upon the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance in the Xuanhuang Realm. The Saint Emperor’s throne, or rather, the entire Sacred Capital City, fell into profound silence due to the impending war. Mao Bao was still in its usual state, lazily sleeping on Li Ping’s shoulder. It seemed that besides Origin Force essence, nothing else could move it. Besides Mao Bao, a figure resembling a child of eight or nine years old also stood beside the Saint Emperor. Gazing intently at the Xuanhuang Realm below. It was Tianyang. At this moment, his puppet body had undergone earth-shattering changes after receiving massive infusions of Origin Force essence and combat memories of the Immortal Puppet [Ancestor]. Its appearance and physique had returned to its living form. In fact, it had truly been born with the aura of life. His strength was unfathomable, gazing at the Myriad Immortals Alliance, awaiting the arrival of his opponent. And below the Saint Emperor’s throne, Yi Jue Daoist of the Du’er Sect had brought out all the paper figures of his entire sect. The paper figures recreated the mountain gate of the Du’er Sect from that year on the spot. In the center of the buildings, a passage leading to an unknown destination seemed to have opened. Although Yi Jue Daoist himself did not enter, his eyes, protruding infinitely outwards, stretched deep into the passage. “Saint Emperor, please rest assured. If anything happens in the Xuanhuang Realm, this old Daoist will definitely see it,” Yi Jue Daoist said with a chuckle. Li Ping did not respond to Yi Jue. In fact, most of his gaze and attention were focused on the starry sky outside the Xuanhuang Realm. There, he had made thorough preparations. Waiting for the Heavenly Physician and the Law Transmitter to descend.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Luo Yan Prefecture, when the Luo Yan Celestial City was breached, most of the Sacred Dynasty soldiers had already transferred to other battlefields. Only a small number were left to guard. However, from the wilderness outside Luo Yan Prefecture, a large group of cultivators suddenly emerged. They did not try to recapture Luo Yan Celestial City, but after a surprise attack, they quickly withdrew.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-310" class="calibre1">Chapter 1298: Star Sea Melee</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, does the Myriad Immortals Alliance really have this 【Eternal Immortal Wall】? It sounds too terrifying."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a good while, Sun Tianci still asked incredulously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Myriad Immortals Alliance's brutality is far from limited to this." Li Fan sneered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan first learned about the Eternal Immortal Wall in the 114th life, during the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit and Profound Net covering the Xuanhuang Realm. He initially thought it was a unique product of the Immortal Alliance in that era.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But in the 119th life, when he impersonated Sun Xingwang, the Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect, and refined countless will-demons within the bodies of tens of thousands of cultivators using the Three Tribulations and Hundred Tribulations Divine Manifestation Technique, the Myriad Immortals Alliance's final method of dealing with these cultivators was similar to the 【Eternal Immortal Wall】 technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From the information revealed by Mo Ru Bin after he possessed the Dharma Transmitter, the Myriad Immortals Alliance did indeed secretly imprison many cultivators to maintain the stability of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, they were not located in just one place. Li Fan transmitted a blurry image to Sun Tianci, and the young prodigy of the Sun family was instantly shocked by the brutal scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, what should we do?" Not long after, he recovered from his shock and asked resolutely.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your 【Profound Nether Art】 is still too slow. Even if we successfully infiltrate the Immortal Wall, we won't have much time to act."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Become faster first!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Profound Nether Art, of course, was the profound technique taught by Li Fan, which dissolved the cultivation of cultivators and returned it to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan's clone flew out of Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, manifesting a phantom form. Li Fan's clone looked up at the sky and slowly whispered, "Erman Tian Di Li..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he chanted softly, an invisible vortex appeared above Li Fan's head. A familiar aura, belonging to the Essence of Heaven and Earth, seemed to be brewing within the vortex. Looking at the blurry humanoid figure gradually emerging from it, Sun Tianci became even more certain of his guess.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"One word to summon the essence of heaven and earth? Master's true identity is actually..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Sun Tianci was somewhat stunned by the scene before him, Li Fan's reprimand sounded in his ears: "What are you still spacing out for? Are you waiting for the essence of heaven and earth to descend?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci instantly came to his senses and immediately aimed a Profound Nether Art at the blurry figure about to be born in the vortex.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As if the process of descent was obstructed, a gust of wind blew, and the essence of heaven and earth, which had been summoned by Li Fan's 'ermanning,' returned to the heavens and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci did not feel his connection with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao deepen during this process. Clearly, because the essence of heaven and earth still belonged to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao and had not been refined and occupied by a cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And due to the "erroneous descent of the essence of heaven and earth" being stopped just as it was about to be completed, the vigilance from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was minimal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes and felt it again, sending out another "Erman Tian Di Li."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, Sun Tianci reacted quickly. As soon as the blurry figure was about to take shape, it was sent back.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They repeated this process hundreds of times until it was about to attract the attention of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, and only then did Li Fan stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci breathed a sigh of relief, wiping the sweat from his pale forehead. Clearly, continuously casting the Profound Nether Art for a long time, "decomposing" hundreds of essences of heaven and earth, even if they were only half-formed, was a significant burden for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's change locations and continue." Li Fan said coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the day he defeated the Martial Maniac and displayed his true combat strength, Sun Tianci was no longer restricted by the Sun family. Even though he was actually only a little over five years old.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Sun Luyuan constantly warned him to prioritize safety and even bestowed many magical treasures upon him for self-defense.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The special training lasted for fifteen days, covering all corners of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Apart from travel time, the remaining time was almost entirely spent on decomposing the essence of heaven and earth. And Sun Tianci's progress was astonishingly rapid. Casually, he could continuously return the half-formed essence of heaven and earth back to heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm, that's about enough." Li Fan said, nodding slightly as he observed Sun Tianci's performance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What are you thinking about?" Li Fan asked, noticing Sun Tianci seemed lost in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Uh, Master, ten days ago, we came to this place. The spiritual energy concentration seemed to be lower than it is now?" Sun Tianci asked somewhat uncertainly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled: "The spiritual energy in the world is like the ebb and flow of the tide; it rises and falls, how can it be constant? Why would it be like your cave dwelling, where you've lived since childhood, always unchanging?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Li Fan's explanation, Sun Tianci nodded slightly, but his eyes, scanning the surroundings, still held a trace of doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This little fellow has such keen observational skills." Li Fan naturally noticed the anomaly in the surrounding environment. He even detected a familiar aura within the permeated spiritual energy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao Yi Worm. It seems to be the Saint Emperor's clone's method. The source should be from the 【Five Elements Great Caves】.... Is he returning the cave to the Xuanhuang Realm to create a combat environment suitable for the Great Qi soldiers? Perhaps he can even launch a fatal blow by utilizing the worm-transformed spiritual energy..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's arrangements were almost entirely derived from the main body's explorations in previous lives. Naturally, with a little thought, he could see through the mystery. But Li Fan did not expose it, merely pretending to be unaware.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning to Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, they headed towards one of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's 【Eternal Immortal Walls】.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tongyan Prefecture, amidst the mountains and cliffs, lies a cave.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This place..." Sun Tianci looked into the distance and felt something unusual: "If it weren't for Master's guidance, even if I had seen this cave before, I would have subconsciously ignored it. I wouldn't have had the slightest desire to enter and investigate..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, this is what is said to be a blessed land accessible only to the predestined. A peculiar creation of the Xuanhuang, requiring no array formations for concealment, making it almost impossible for most people to spy on. There are many such hidden caves in the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Most of them have been occupied by those Dharma Transmitters as their own residences."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's mind flashed back to the hidden cave he encountered when he met Mo Ru Bin in the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters in the 119th life. It was exactly the same as this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Because of its natural characteristics, the stationed cultivators will certainly not have high vigilance. But still, proceed with caution..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's spiritual sense set up a series of formations around Sun Tianci, and then the two of them flew into the cave.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After passing through a narrow, downward passage, they arrived before a deep cave, only wide enough for one person's waist, plunging straight down into the abyss. It was pitch black, and they plummeted downwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It took a full cup of tea's time, as if they had pierced through the Xuanhuang earth and arrived at the deepest parts of the Nine Netherworld.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The narrow cave passage finally began to widen. After passing through a horizontal passage, a huge cave resembling an inverted cone, located deep underground, suddenly appeared before Sun Tianci.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The cliff walls of the cave were densely covered with square openings. Upon closer inspection, these openings were filled with amber-colored crystalline bodies. And within these crystalline bodies, without exception, a cultivator slept.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Occasionally, one could see Immortal Alliance guards patrolling in mid-air.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci dared not release his divine sense to investigate, but could roughly estimate that this underground cave imprisoned and sealed at least over a hundred thousand cultivators. Their faces were ruddy, and even smiles appeared on their faces, completely unaware that they were doomed to eternal slumber.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to Master, this is only a part of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's 【Eternal Immortal Wall】..." Sun Tianci couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine and subconsciously clenched his fists.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Go, the rest is up to you now." Li Fan seemed to see Sun Tianci's suppressed anger and said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, he transmitted the method for breaking the seal formation of the sleeping cultivators to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, if we were to awaken all the cultivators here, what do you think would happen?" Sun Tianci suddenly asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I advise you to abandon this idea. Since the Myriad Immortals Alliance dares to do this so openly, they must have made precautions. Believe me, you will not be able to awaken them faster than the Myriad Immortals Alliance can deal with them. You must know that the Myriad Immortals Alliance possesses the means to extract and preserve a cultivator's Dao foundation." Li Fan said coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci's eyes flickered, but in the end, he had no choice but to give up.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Avoiding the patrolling cultivators, he flew rapidly past these sleeping, pitiful figures. A barely perceptible breeze stirred, dissolving the Dao foundation within their bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Without their cultivation, they won't live long in their sleep... It's equivalent to me killing them with my own hands..." Sun Tianci's flying body trembled slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Killing? Or saving? Look at their current state, isn't it better than death? If they could consciously perceive everything around them, they would surely beg you to end their suffering." Li Fan said, comforting him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After another round of persuasion, Sun Tianci's hesitant actions finally became resolute.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For more than five years, Li Fan had been cultivating Sun Tianci according to his ideal image of the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate. As a result, although he was benevolent, he was not pedantic. Moreover, once he made a decision, he became extremely resolute.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao power, condensed from the decomposition of tens of thousands of cultivators, was gathered by Li Fan into a bright pearl of light.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the act of "mercy killing" was one-fifth complete, Li Fan said, "That's about enough. If we continue, even I won't be able to conceal this intense energy fluctuation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci looked at the remaining sleeping figures with a hint of regret. But he still obeyed his master's command and quietly flew towards the exit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, is there anything wrong?" As he reached the top of the vast cave, Sun Tianci noticed that his master seemed to be still gazing at a certain spot below, and couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's nothing, just leave as instructed." After a brief silence, Li Fan finally responded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci asked no further questions and flew upwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After leaving the terrifying dungeon, Sun Tianci took the pearl containing the Dao foundation of countless cultivators and gently crushed it. Countless rays of light instantly burst forth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In a daze, Sun Tianci seemed to see wondrous phenomena of the world, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, and the changing landscapes of mountains and rivers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the sky, the clouds and mist changed, as if being ground by a giant millstone, with creaking sounds echoing through the clouds. And the entire Xuanhuang Realm instantly trembled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the amplitude was minimal, Sun Tianci still perceived it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Myriad Immortals Alliance must have sent people to investigate! Let's go!" Li Fan said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Without needing further reminders, Sun Tianci had already flown away from the site of the incident the moment he crushed the pearl. At this moment, he was immersed in the rapid increase of Xuanhuang Heavenly Favor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan, after ensuring that no one was tracking them, returned to the Saint Emperor's seat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Deepest part of the Sacred Heavenly Court. The core of the Myriad Spirits Great Formation. In addition, the Soul Refining Great Formation and many other formations were superimposed. Even the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao consciousness, which was closely related to the Saint Emperor, would have its connection severed here. Ensuring that all external probing was cut off.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lin Ling, the Saint Emperor's disciple, formerly the spirit entity of the Spiritual Wood Realm, had now revealed her original form. However, it looked quite bizarre: the tree was inverted, with its crown at the bottom. Dense roots were at the top.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The buildings scattered throughout the Sacred Heavenly Court, such as the Heroic Spirit Seat, the Sacred Medical Hall, the Sacred Academy, the Sacred Heart Hall, and the Sacred Supervision Court, were all connected to the roots of the inverted spiritual tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the heart of the tree, all the scenes that had occurred within the Sacred Heavenly Court were synchronously displayed. After an image was played, it turned into green light and was absorbed by the inverted spiritual tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the inverted spiritual tree before him, a rare hint of hesitation flashing in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To prepare for victory, one must first prepare for defeat. The Saint Emperor's actions are truly the actions of supreme wisdom!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Beside Li Fan, a yellow paper figure with a distressed face was unrestrainedly praising the inverted spiritual tree. It was Yi Jue Daoist of the Tribulation Crossing Sect. He sat on the Book of Tribulation Crossing, staring intently at the inverted spiritual tree before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, the Saint Emperor's plan is for the Xuanhuang Realm, not for himself, so it cannot be said to be undermining his morale." Yi Jue Daoist continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor remained silent. However, from time to time, he would issue hand seals, causing the roots of the inverted spiritual tree to sway. And in the heart of the tree, the absorption of the Great Qi images seemed to accelerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, the Saint Emperor stopped his movements. He suddenly spoke: "This time, the battle against the Myriad Immortals Alliance, your Tribulation Crossing Sect does not need to act."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just hide in the dark and watch..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Whether there are other prying eyes." The Saint Emperor's tone was enigmatic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Sacred Heavenly Court and the Immortal Alliance are engaged in a great battle. This is a shift in the Xuanhuang Realm not seen in millennia. If that power secretly monitoring the Xuanhuang Realm is still in operation, it will surely supervise this matter and transmit information. I do not require you to find the final destination of the information. Just determine whether the event has occurred." The Saint Emperor instructed word by word.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Jue Daoist of the Tribulation Crossing Sect finally relaxed his tightly furrowed brow. He clapped his hands and praised: "The Saint Emperor's actions are truly in line with the Great Dao of our Tribulation Crossing Sect. If the Saint Emperor is willing, I can cede the position of Sect Master of the Tribulation Crossing Sect..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before Yi Jue Daoist could finish speaking, the Saint Emperor interrupted him: "Regardless of whether I or the Dharma Transmitter wins, you must inform the victor of the outcome. As for after completing the task... do as you please."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Jue Daoist did not show the joy of gaining freedom, but rather looked stunned. His vaguely shaped paper hands pointed at the inverted spiritual tree: "I won't go together?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor laughed lightly: "This 'Outside Wood' contains only Lin Ling, the only living being within. I have not left any escape routes for her. Do you, the Tribulation Crossing Sect, expect to follow her?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Jue Daoist immediately looked dejected: "Saint Emperor, please reconsider. Can that tree spirit, which has only recently been born, achieve anything on its own? In the vast Star Sea, it might encounter some disaster and perish on the way. Won't the Saint Emperor's escape plan be abandoned midway..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping waved his hand, interrupting him. Staring at the inverted spiritual tree, he corrected: "It is not an escape plan, but the preservation of information."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Jue Daoist sighed mournfully, "What's the difference?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping squinted his eyes, remaining silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This 【Outside Wood】 not only preserved the image data of all events that had occurred in the Sacred Heavenly Court since its founding. Even the true spirits and memories of those who had fallen during this period, originally residing in the Heroic Spirit Seat, would be transferred here when activated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a backup plan conceived by the Saint Emperor, inspired by the theory of information immutability from the Great Evolution Sect, for the entire Sacred Heavenly Court. Or rather, the word "proof" was more appropriate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If Li Ping won, then naturally there was nothing more to say. The Outside Wood would not be activated. But if Li Ping lost, then this Outside Wood would, upon the destruction of the Great Qi, carry the true spirits of the Sacred Heavenly Court's subjects and fly into the depths of the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If it were a physical entity, it would certainly not escape the Dharma Transmitter's obstruction. But if it were merely information, the Dharma Transmitter might not care. Coupled with the interference from the Tribulation Crossing Sect at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not that the Saint Emperor had wavered about the decisive battle. After all, there was no place left for any living being in this 【Outside Wood】. It was rather that the Saint Emperor wanted to leave a "proof of existence" for the countless subjects who had followed and believed in him, in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping knew that during the thousands of years of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's rule over half of the Xuanhuang Realm. The Sacred Heavenly Court was not the first to rebel. There had been an example of a coalition of worlds rising up in resistance five hundred years ago. But after their failure, all information about them was erased and sealed by the Myriad Immortals Alliance. It was as if these losers had never existed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping's action was to prevent such a thing from happening again. "Even if we lose, our existence will not be erased!" "If, after many years, the Outside Wood can return to the Xuanhuang Realm, it would be even better."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Various thoughts flashed through Li Ping's mind, and he quickly suppressed them.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-311" class="calibre1">Chapter 1299: Immortals Descend Upon All Things Void</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Xuanhuang Realm was revitalized by a surge of celestial spiritual energy, transforming the land and its inhabitants. However, this abundance fueled rampant greed among cultivators, leading to widespread slaughter as they fought over the precious energy. Only the Great Qi Imperial Guards and the Qingxuan Army, practicing the [Profound Yellow Immortal Heart Incantation], retained their sanity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor, sensing the Dharma Transmitter's approach, propagated a new cultivation method, the [Foundation Establishment method], which bypassed traditional cultivation requirements and garnered immense favor from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. This move threatened the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s legitimacy, prompting desperation among their ranks. Simultaneously, a prisoner in the Nether Prison broke free, reborn and seeking to exploit the chaos.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters, Xu Ke and Yin Shangren prepared to retrieve Mr. Bai's skull and a mysterious golden tree. As they awaited the Saint Emperor's next move, a colossal moon-like world descended upon Xuanhuang, sealing off four prefectures under the Saint Emperor’s [Bright Moon Starlight Great Formation]. The Immortal Alliance's formation masters struggled against this impenetrable barrier, while Dharma Transmitter Ren grew increasingly enraged.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, in the Star Sea, the Saint Emperor confronted the Dharma Transmitter. His [Dao Annihilation, Dao Creation] technique, amplified by Xuanhuang’s power, struck the Dharma Transmitter, revealing his terrifying regenerative abilities and hinting at a strength beyond the Star Sea's current limits. The ensuing battle between these two titans promised to reshape the fate of Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the midst of this turmoil, the Xuanxianzhou, a vessel carrying ancient True Immortal script, found itself caught in a perilous situation. After being manipulated into attacking Xuanhuang, they were ensnared by an unseen entity, a mysterious shadow that phased through the Xianzhou and vanished, leaving behind a chilling aura of death. This entity, identified by Li Fan (as the Saint Emperor's clone) as a primordial guardian, posed a new and unpredictable threat. The Xianzhou, now stranded and vulnerable, faced despair as their plans were thwarted and their existence threatened.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-312" class="calibre1">Chapter 1300: Golden Needles Reverse Xuanhuang</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, does the Myriad Immortals Alliance really have this 【Eternal Immortal Wall】? It sounds too terrifying."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a good while, Sun Tianci still asked incredulously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Myriad Immortals Alliance's brutality is far from limited to this." Li Fan sneered. Li Fan first learned about the Eternal Immortal Wall in the 114th life, during the Heavenly Profound Lock Spirit and Profound Net covering the Xuanhuang Realm. He initially thought it was a unique product of the Immortal Alliance in that era. But in the 119th life, when he impersonated Sun Xingwang, the Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect, and refined countless will-demons within the bodies of tens of thousands of cultivators using the Three Tribulations and Hundred Tribulations Divine Manifestation Technique, the Myriad Immortals Alliance's final method of dealing with these cultivators was similar to the 【Eternal Immortal Wall】 technique. From the information revealed by Mo Ru Bin after he possessed the Dharma Transmitter, the Myriad Immortals Alliance did indeed secretly imprison many cultivators to maintain the stability of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, they were not located in just one place. Li Fan transmitted a blurry image to Sun Tianci, and the young prodigy of the Sun family was instantly shocked by the brutal scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, what should we do?" Not long after, he recovered from his shock and asked resolutely.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your 【Profound Nether Art】 is still too slow. Even if we successfully infiltrate the Immortal Wall, we won't have much time to act."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Become faster first!" The Profound Nether Art, of course, was the profound technique taught by Li Fan, which dissolved the cultivation of cultivators and returned it to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan's clone flew out of Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, manifesting a phantom form. Li Fan's clone looked up at the sky and slowly whispered, "Erman Tian Di Li..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he chanted softly, an invisible vortex appeared above Li Fan's head. A familiar aura, belonging to the Essence of Heaven and Earth, seemed to be brewing within the vortex. Looking at the blurry humanoid figure gradually emerging from it, Sun Tianci became even more certain of his guess.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"One word to summon the essence of heaven and earth? Master's true identity is actually..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Sun Tianci was somewhat stunned by the scene before him, Li Fan's reprimand sounded in his ears: "What are you still spacing out for? Are you waiting for the essence of heaven and earth to descend?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Tianci instantly came to his senses and immediately aimed a Profound Nether Art at the blurry figure about to be born in the vortex. As if the process of descent was obstructed, a gust of wind blew, and the essence of heaven and earth, which had been summoned by Li Fan's 'ermanning,' returned to the heavens and earth. Sun Tianci did not feel his connection with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao deepen during this process. Clearly, because the essence of heaven and earth still belonged to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao and had not been refined and occupied by a cultivator. And due to the "erroneous descent of the essence of heaven and earth" being stopped just as it was about to be completed, the vigilance from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was minimal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes and felt it again, sending out another "Erman Tian Di Li." This time, Sun Tianci reacted quickly. As soon as the blurry figure was about to take shape, it was sent back. They repeated this process hundreds of times until it was about to attract the attention of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, and only then did Li Fan stop. Sun Tianci breathed a sigh of relief, wiping the sweat from his pale forehead. Clearly, continuously casting the Profound Nether Art for a long time, "decomposing" hundreds of essences of heaven and earth, even if they were only half-formed, was a significant burden for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's change locations and continue." Li Fan said coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the day he defeated the Martial Maniac and displayed his true combat strength, Sun Tianci was no longer restricted by the Sun family. Even though he was actually only a little over five years old. However, Sun Luyuan constantly warned him to prioritize safety and even bestowed many magical treasures upon him for self-defense. The special training lasted for fifteen days, covering all corners of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Apart from travel time, the remaining time was almost entirely spent on decomposing the essence of heaven and earth. And Sun Tianci's progress was astonishingly rapid. Casually, he could continuously return the half-formed essence of heaven and earth back to heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm, that's about enough." Li Fan said, nodding slightly as he observed Sun Tianci's performance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What are you thinking about?" Li Fan asked, noticing Sun Tianci seemed lost in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Uh, Master, ten days ago, we came to this place. The spiritual energy concentration seemed to be lower than it is now?" Sun Tianci asked somewhat uncertainly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled: "The spiritual energy in the world is like the ebb and flow of the tide; it rises and falls, how can it be constant? Why would it be like your cave dwelling, where you've lived since childhood, always unchanging?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Li Fan's explanation, Sun Tianci nodded slightly, but his eyes, scanning the surroundings, still held a trace of doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This little fellow has such keen observational skills." Li Fan naturally noticed the anomaly in the surrounding environment. He even detected a familiar aura within the permeated spiritual energy. "Dao Yi Worm. It seems to be the Saint Emperor's clone's method. The source should be from the 【Five Elements Great Caves】.... Is he returning the cave to the Xuanhuang Realm to create a combat environment suitable for the Great Qi soldiers? Perhaps he can even launch a fatal blow by utilizing the worm-transformed spiritual energy..." The Saint Emperor's arrangements were almost entirely derived from the main body's explorations in previous lives. Naturally, with a little thought, he could see through the mystery. But Li Fan did not expose it, merely pretending to be unaware.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning to Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, they headed towards one of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's 【Eternal Immortal Walls】. In Tongyan Prefecture, amidst the mountains and cliffs, lies a cave.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This place..." Sun Tianci looked into the distance and felt something unusual: "If it weren't for Master's guidance, even if I had seen this cave before, I would have subconsciously ignored it. I wouldn't have had the slightest desire to enter and investigate..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, this is what is said to be a blessed land accessible only to the predestined. A peculiar creation of the Xuanhuang, requiring no array formations for concealment, making it almost impossible for most people to spy on. There are many such hidden caves in the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Most of them have been occupied by those Dharma Transmitters as their own residences." Li Fan's mind flashed back to the hidden cave he encountered when he met Mo Ru Bin in the Myriad Immortals Alliance headquarters in the 119th life. It was exactly the same as this place. "Because of its natural characteristics, the stationed cultivators will certainly not have high vigilance. But still, proceed with caution..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's spiritual sense set up a series of formations around Sun Tianci, and then the two of them flew into the cave. After passing through a narrow, downward passage, they arrived before a deep cave, only wide enough for one person's waist, plunging straight down into the abyss. It was pitch black, and they plummeted downwards. It took a full cup of tea's time, as if they had pierced through the Xuanhuang earth and arrived at the deepest parts of the Nine Netherworld. The narrow cave passage finally began to widen. After passing through a horizontal passage, a huge cave resembling an inverted cone, located deep underground, suddenly appeared before Sun Tianci. The cliff walls of the cave were densely covered with square openings. Upon closer inspection, these openings were filled with amber-colored crystalline bodies. And within these crystalline bodies, without exception, a cultivator slept. Occasionally, one could see Immortal Alliance guards patrolling in mid-air. Sun Tianci dared not release his divine sense to investigate, but could roughly estimate that this underground cave imprisoned and sealed at least over a hundred thousand cultivators. Their faces were ruddy, and even smiles appeared on their faces, completely unaware that they were doomed to eternal slumber.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to Master, this is only a part of the Myriad Immortals Alliance's 【Eternal Immortal Wall】..." Sun Tianci couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine and subconsciously clenched his fists.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Go, the rest is up to you now." Li Fan seemed to see Sun Tianci's suppressed anger and said calmly. At the same time, he transmitted the method for breaking the seal formation of the sleeping cultivators to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, if we were to awaken all the cultivators here, what do you think would happen?" Sun Tianci suddenly asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I advise you to abandon this idea. Since the Myriad Immortals Alliance dares to do this so openly, they must have made precautions. Believe me, you will not be able to awaken them faster than the Myriad Immortals Alliance can deal with them. You must know that the Myriad Immortals Alliance possesses the means to extract and preserve a cultivator's Dao foundation." Li Fan said coldly. Sun Tianci's eyes flickered, but in the end, he had no choice but to give up. Avoiding the patrolling cultivators, he flew rapidly past these sleeping, pitiful figures. A barely perceptible breeze stirred, dissolving the Dao foundation within their bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Without their cultivation, they won't live long in their sleep... It's equivalent to me killing them with my own hands..." Sun Tianci's flying body trembled slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Killing? Or saving? Look at their current state, isn't it better than death? If they could consciously perceive everything around them, they would surely beg you to end their suffering." Li Fan said, comforting him. After another round of persuasion, Sun Tianci's hesitant actions finally became resolute. For more than five years, Li Fan had been cultivating Sun Tianci according to his ideal image of the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate. As a result, although he was benevolent, he was not pedantic. Moreover, once he made a decision, he became extremely resolute. The Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao power, condensed from the decomposition of tens of thousands of cultivators, was gathered by Li Fan into a bright pearl of light.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the act of "mercy killing" was one-fifth complete, Li Fan said, "That's about enough. If we continue, even I won't be able to conceal this intense energy fluctuation." Sun Tianci looked at the remaining sleeping figures with a hint of regret. But he still obeyed his master's command and quietly flew towards the exit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master, is there anything wrong?" As he reached the top of the vast cave, Sun Tianci noticed that his master seemed to be still gazing at a certain spot below, and couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's nothing, just leave as instructed." After a brief silence, Li Fan finally responded. Sun Tianci asked no further questions and flew upwards. After leaving the terrifying dungeon, Sun Tianci took the pearl containing the Dao foundation of countless cultivators and gently crushed it. Countless rays of light instantly burst forth. In a daze, Sun Tianci seemed to see wondrous phenomena of the world, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, and the changing landscapes of mountains and rivers. In the sky, the clouds and mist changed, as if being ground by a giant millstone, with creaking sounds echoing through the clouds. And the entire Xuanhuang Realm instantly trembled. Although the amplitude was minimal, Sun Tianci still perceived it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Myriad Immortals Alliance must have sent people to investigate! Let's go!" Li Fan said. Without needing further reminders, Sun Tianci had already flown away from the site of the incident the moment he crushed the pearl. At this moment, he was immersed in the rapid increase of Xuanhuang Heavenly Favor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan, after ensuring that no one was tracking them, returned to the Saint Emperor's seat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Deepest part of the Sacred Heavenly Court. The core of the Myriad Spirits Great Formation. In addition, the Soul Refining Great Formation and many other formations were superimposed. Even the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao consciousness, which was closely related to the Saint Emperor, would have its connection severed here. Ensuring that all external probing was cut off.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lin Ling, the Saint Emperor's disciple, formerly the spirit entity of the Spiritual Wood Realm, had now revealed her original form. However, it looked quite bizarre: the tree was inverted, with its crown at the bottom. Dense roots were at the top. The buildings scattered throughout the Sacred Heavenly Court, such as the Heroic Spirit Seat, the Sacred Medical Hall, the Sacred Academy, the Sacred Heart Hall, and the Sacred Supervision Court, were all connected to the roots of the inverted spiritual tree. In the heart of the tree, all the scenes that had occurred within the Sacred Heavenly Court were synchronously displayed. After an image was played, it turned into green light and was absorbed by the inverted spiritual tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the inverted spiritual tree before him, a rare hint of hesitation flashing in his eyes. "To prepare for victory, one must first prepare for defeat. The Saint Emperor's actions are truly the actions of supreme wisdom!" Beside Li Fan, a yellow paper figure with a distressed face was unrestrainedly praising the inverted spiritual tree. It was Yi Jue Daoist of the Tribulation Crossing Sect. He sat on the Book of Tribulation Crossing, staring intently at the inverted spiritual tree before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, the Saint Emperor's plan is for the Xuanhuang Realm, not for himself, so it cannot be said to be undermining his morale." Yi Jue Daoist continued. The Saint Emperor remained silent. However, from time to time, he would issue hand seals, causing the roots of the inverted spiritual tree to sway. And in the heart of the tree, the absorption of the Great Qi images seemed to accelerate. After a long while, the Saint Emperor stopped his movements. He suddenly spoke: "This time, the battle against the Myriad Immortals Alliance, your Tribulation Crossing Sect does not need to act."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just hide in the dark and watch..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Whether there are other prying eyes." The Saint Emperor's tone was enigmatic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Sacred Heavenly Court and the Immortal Alliance are engaged in a great battle. This is a shift in the Xuanhuang Realm not seen in millennia. If that power secretly monitoring the Xuanhuang Realm is still in operation, it will surely supervise this matter and transmit information. I do not require you to find the final destination of the information. Just determine whether the event has occurred." The Saint Emperor instructed word by word. Yi Jue Daoist of the Tribulation Crossing Sect finally relaxed his tightly furrowed brow. He clapped his hands and praised: "The Saint Emperor's actions are truly in line with the Great Dao of our Tribulation Crossing Sect. If the Saint Emperor is willing, I can cede the position of Sect Master of the Tribulation Crossing Sect..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before Yi Jue Daoist could finish speaking, the Saint Emperor interrupted him: "Regardless of whether I or the Dharma Transmitter wins, you must inform the victor of the outcome. As for after completing the task... do as you please." Yi Jue Daoist did not show the joy of gaining freedom, but rather looked stunned. His vaguely shaped paper hands pointed at the inverted spiritual tree: "I won't go together?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor laughed lightly: "This 'Outside Wood' contains only Lin Ling, the only living being within. I have not left any escape routes for her. Do you, the Tribulation Crossing Sect, expect to follow her?" Yi Jue Daoist immediately looked dejected: "Saint Emperor, please reconsider. Can that tree spirit, which has only recently been born, achieve anything on its own? In the vast Star Sea, it might encounter some disaster and perish on the way. Won't the Saint Emperor's escape plan be abandoned midway..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping waved his hand, interrupting him. Staring at the inverted spiritual tree, he corrected: "It is not an escape plan, but the preservation of information."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yi Jue Daoist sighed mournfully, "What's the difference?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Ping squinted his eyes, remaining silent. This 【Outside Wood】 not only preserved the image data of all events that had occurred in the Sacred Heavenly Court since its founding. Even the true spirits and memories of those who had fallen during this period, originally residing in the Heroic Spirit Seat, would be transferred here when activated. This was a backup plan conceived by the Saint Emperor, inspired by the theory of information immutability from the Great Evolution Sect, for the entire Sacred Heavenly Court. Or rather, the word "proof" was more appropriate. If Li Ping won, then naturally there was nothing more to say. The Outside Wood would not be activated. But if Li Ping lost, then this Outside Wood would, upon the destruction of the Great Qi, carry the true spirits of the Sacred Heavenly Court's subjects and fly into the depths of the void. If it were a physical entity, it would certainly not escape the Dharma Transmitter's obstruction. But if it were merely information, the Dharma Transmitter might not care. Coupled with the interference from the Tribulation Crossing Sect at that time. It was not that the Saint Emperor had wavered about the decisive battle.

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If, after many years, the Outside Wood can return to the Xuanhuang Realm, it would be even better." Various thoughts flashed through Li Ping's mind, and he quickly suppressed them.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-313" class="calibre1">Chapter 1301: Xuanhuang Wind Disaster</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This formation... Who could it be?!" The Saint Emperor felt both startled and furious in his heart. The Dharma Transmitter, the Heavenly Physician, and even the Xuanxianzhou from the distant Star Sea were clearly not the ones who set up the formation. In this sea of stars, who else possessed the power to set up a grand formation that made him tremble with fear?! And what was the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, who had recently descended but never revealed himself, doing all this time! Countless thoughts flashed through the Saint Emperor's mind. The golden needles outside the star sea continued to fly in endlessly. Dense and fast, they alternated between substance and illusion. The Saint Emperor, who already couldn't block all these golden needles, now sensed that the Xuanhuang Realm seemed to be inexplicably in crisis. To make matters worse, the Heavenly Physician seemed completely unaware of this. "Heavenly Physician! Xuanhuang Realm!" Helpless, the Saint Emperor roared in warning towards the outside of the star sea. The continuous rain of golden needles seemed to pause slightly, but it did not stop. However, the positions where the golden needles landed on the Xuanhuang great land had indeed changed slightly compared to before. It should be that the Heavenly Physician had also perceived the hidden changes in the Xuanhuang Realm and was attempting to reverse them through the formation. But... "It's useless!" The Saint Emperor could see that it only slightly delayed the speed at which the catastrophe descended. The intangible, unknown formation was still in the process of preparing to descend. His own spiritual sense's instinctual warning made the Saint Emperor feel an inexplicable sense of dread. Suppressing his inner unease, the Saint Emperor's mind raced, and he finally decided to ignore the Heavenly Physician's golden needles for now and reluctantly returned to the Xuanhuang Realm. "Find the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate!" The Saint Emperor's voice echoed. In the current Xuanhuang world, golden needles were everywhere. Most living beings were in a deep slumber. The Tianyang who had previously blocked the Dharma Transmitter had a body that was already heavily damaged. But he persistently stood in front of the Dharma Transmitter. However, the Dharma Transmitter also gradually sensed the imminent crisis facing the Xuanhuang Realm, and his movements gradually slowed down. Otherwise, Tianyang's immortal puppet body might have been completely destroyed. His vast divine sense swept across the Xuanhuang Realm repeatedly, but he couldn't find the trace of the Great Heavenly Venerate. "The Woood, the Earth Veins, the Stone Slabs!" The Saint Emperor tried to communicate with them through the connection of the Origin Force Essence Net. However, they all seemed to have collectively disappeared, and none of them responded. The Xuanhuang Realm before him was like water about to boil. The Saint Emperor could only watch powerlessly as everything happened, unable to find the source of the heat that was boiling the water. In the sky, the Dharma Transmitter's phantom image suddenly appeared, dispersing all the clouds. Manifesting the Dharma and heavenly form, he looked down upon Xuanhuang. His gaze was like a torch, sweeping back and forth. On the great land, golden light continuously emanated from the golden needles, spreading outwards. With each flash, the golden needles pulsed, encircling the Xuanhuang Realm. This magnificent scene was the combined effort of the Dharma Transmitter and the Heavenly Venerate, searching the heavens and earth. They aimed to find the whereabouts of the mastermind. But an unbelievable scene occurred. Despite the combined efforts of the two strongest cultivators in the star sea, and after nearly half a day, they still found no trace. It was as if the mastermind simply did not exist. ... While the three peerless powerhouses of the star sea gathered, yet were at a loss, deep beneath Tongyan Prefecture. The secret chamber, originally only measuring one zhang square, had now transformed into endless void. At the edge of the void, where the ritual to enter the Immortal Slaying Realm was located, it was now enveloped by an indescribable mystical power. This was the power that drove all cultivators to madness: the power of Immortal Essence. The power of Immortal Essence, like a gentle stream, like faint threads of light, circled the ritual, opening up endless void. The Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, whom the Dharma Transmitter, Saint Emperor, and Heavenly Physician had searched for so hard, and the mastermind behind all the turmoil, were here! Let alone Li Fan's current avatar, even if Li Fan's true body were to personally arrive, with his current strength, he would not be able to manipulate the power of Immortal Essence. He could not even touch or comprehend it, at best he could only look at the moon and quench his thirst. The reason why the power of Immortal Essence could be integrated into the immortal formation deduced by the Terminal Dissolution Disc... In the void, Sun Tianci still maintained the posture he had before entering the Immortal Slaying Realm trial. Two vastly different auras, divine and demonic, emanated from his body simultaneously. Although the intensity of the divine aura far surpassed the gloomy demonic energy, facing the aggressive demonic energy, the divine aura could only retreat repeatedly. Even if it could unleash its power at any moment and completely sweep away the entangled demonic energy, Sun Tianci still did not do so. His brows were tightly furrowed, and his face showed sorrow. "Fortunately, I made a backup plan..." Sensing that Wu Ninglu, whom he had released, was causing chaos in Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness, Li Fan sneered inwardly. Myriad demonic thoughts constantly gnawed at Sun Tianci, while also emitting malicious curses. "I carried you for three years and gave birth to you. How did you treat me?" "Not only did you steal my Heavenly and Earthly Essence that I merged with the Dao, but you also watched me die with folded arms!" "You are truly my mother's good son!" "Everything you have now was snatched from me! You shouldn't have lived from the beginning!" "Come on! Kill me again! Let me scatter my soul and be utterly annihilated!" ... Facing his mother's revenge, Sun Tianci chose to bear it silently. He could naturally feel his mother devouring his power, but this was precisely what he wanted. In Sun Tianci's perception, although Wu Ninglu had manifested as myriad demonic thoughts, they were all chaotic consciousnesses filled with madness and destructive intent. If the subject of her vengeful desires, him, no longer existed, these demonic thoughts would dissipate into the heavens and earth before long. And if that were the case... He, Sun Tianci, would truly never see his mother again. Since childhood, Sun Tianci, who had memories since birth and witnessed firsthand how he "killed" his own mother, had always been filled with guilt. This time, he was prepared to save her. In Sun Tianci's perception, as the demonic thoughts consumed more of his energy, their chaos gradually decreased. As long as he continued to "feed" them, his mother would eventually calm down completely. It seemed like cutting flesh to nurture his mother, but it was far from exaggerated. After all, the power of the Great Heavenly Venerate was like a vast ocean, boundless and endless. Compared to it, his mother's myriad demonic thoughts were merely a school of fish in the vast sea. However, it would take some time for Sun Tianci to complete this feeding process. Sun Tianci was naturally aware of all the drastic changes happening in the Xuanhuang Realm. The Fated Saint Emperor, the Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate, and the countless golden needles that appeared at the end made Sun Tianci, the newly appointed Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, feel extremely troubled. However, due to his responsibilities, he had to save the Xuanhuang Realm. To be honest, it was somewhat difficult for him to accomplish this alone. Fortunately, he had his master's help. After experiencing the trials of the stories he had heard since childhood in the Immortal Slaying Realm, and after seeing his master's true form before sending him into the Immortal Slaying Realm, Sun Tianci naturally understood his extremely mysterious master's true identity. He was precisely the remnant wisp left behind by the previous Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, Su Bai, after his demise. Driven by the obsession to save the Xuanhuang Realm, he attached himself to him. He had been nurturing and teaching him since childhood, and finally helped him succeed as the Great Heavenly Venerate. Although his master had not explicitly stated all of this, Sun Tianci had deduced it from the many details of his daily interactions with his master and his experience of inheriting the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate position in the Immortal Slaying Realm. After all, besides the previous Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, who else could be so clear about the details and answers of the inheritance trial? Although he had just succeeded and a large amount of complex memories flooded his mind, which he hadn't had time to sort through, his master could already skillfully use the power of Immortal Essence to set up formations... Sun Tianci's mind couldn't help but recall his master's words just now. It was when he successfully inherited the position of Great Heavenly Venerate and awoke from the Immortal Slaying Realm. His master looked at him with a look of relief and said, "You didn't disappoint me, good child." Then he earnestly admonished him, "Ten thousand years have passed, and the Xuanhuang Realm is no longer the Xuanhuang Realm it once was. Since the immortal path is cut off and the immortal realm no longer exists, from now on, the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate should only be the Great Heavenly Venerate of the Xuanhuang Realm, not the Great Heavenly Venerate of the Xuanhuang Realm in the immortal world..." "Now, the Xuanhuang Realm is the only pure land in the sea of stars. Outsiders are all coveting the Xuanhuang Realm. Since you have succeeded, you must bear the responsibility of the Great Heavenly Venerate and protect Xuanhuang." "The Dharma Transmitter, the Heavenly Physician, the Xuanxianzhou... perhaps only that Saint Emperor will stand with us." "The time you've left me is too short. You've only just succeeded, and you might even struggle to deal with the Dharma Transmitter..." "The only chance to turn the tide lies in the ancient guardian formation!" Sun Tianci's mind was suddenly filled with some blurry memories. "Master, do you mean..." "After inheriting the position of Great Heavenly Venerate, you should have simultaneously inherited the power of Immortal Essence after detonating the immortal artifact?" Li Fan asked. "Yes." Sun Tianci nodded. His master was merely a remnant soul, and many years had passed. It was normal for his memory to be somewhat incomplete. Knowing about the Great Heavenly Venerate's legacy further proved his identity. Hearing Sun Tianci's affirmative answer, Li Fan looked at the Xuanhuang Realm below, his eyes flashing, "The guardian formation has been abandoned for ten thousand years. It has even been repaired by the Xuan Tian Sect..." "But even so, as long as it is activated, it can successfully block these invaders. It might even be possible to kill them." "Just mobilize a small amount of that Immortal Essence power, like this..." Sun Tianci, recalling the formation diagram he received from Li Fan, awakened some of his inherited memories. The traces of the formation in the diagram almost perfectly matched, except that, as his master said, some parts had changed over time. The mysteries of the immortal formation were endless. Sun Tianci, as the newly appointed Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, was not yet proficient in it. Just as he was about to ponder further, Sun Tianci sensed that the Dharma Transmitter had already returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, seemingly searching for his whereabouts. Sun Tianci's heart tightened. The strength of this Dharma Transmitter was no less than his own, if not stronger. If he didn't use those immortal artifacts. But within the Xuanhuang Realm, immortal artifacts could not be easily used. Especially since he had not yet familiarized himself with the use of the four immortal artifacts inherited from the Heavenly Venerate's legacy. If he were to accidentally injure the Xuanhuang Realm... That would be a grave sin indeed. The situation was urgent, and Sun Tianci decided to follow his master's advice and activate the ancient guardian formation to deal with the Dharma Transmitter. He had almost complete trust in his master, and his own understanding of formations was not precise. Whatever Li Fan said, Sun Tianci would do. Everything was proceeding smoothly at first. Unexpectedly, just as the formation was about to take shape, his mother, who had already died, suddenly appeared in Sun Tianci's sea of consciousness for some unknown reason. Transforming into myriad demonic souls, burning with the flames of revenge, she instantly overwhelmed Sun Tianci's mind. That familiar, incredibly intimate aura, the face that only existed in memories and dreams, had now turned into vengeful spirits seeking his life. It made Sun Tianci's mind fall into utter chaos. Li Fan seemed to have sensed Sun Tianci's discomfort and quickly transmitted a serious reminder: "This is your karma and original sin. You must resolve it with your own heart." "Although you merged with the Dao at birth, you incurred a blood debt because of it. The resulting inner fear and anxiety could not be calmed even by the Immortal Heart Incantation." "It has always been hidden in the depths of your heart, growing with you. When you inherited the position of Great Heavenly Venerate and gained immense power, she also transformed because of it and finally manifested. However, for you, this is also a rare opportunity. As long as you can resolve this inner demon this time, you will have no flaws from now on..." Li Fan quickly reminded Sun Tianci while saying, "The changes in the formation should proceed as I instructed. Focus on dealing with your inner demon." It must be known that Sun Tianci was, after all, only a child less than ten years old. Although he had accidentally inherited the position of Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate through a stroke of luck, facing his longed-for birth mother, he was inevitably overwhelmed by his emotions. Li Fan's continuous teaching and guidance over the years had also made Sun Tianci subconsciously obey his orders. A terrifying immortal formation based on the Xuanhuang Guardian Formation was thus slowly taking shape. Sun Tianci, the "power source," was still unaware. He only saw that after the Heavenly Physician forcibly interrupted and restored the process of Xuanhuang's fusion with the golden needles, it further strengthened his resolve to use the immortal formation. Li Fan's avatar, with an infatuated expression, looked at the immortal formation about to take shape. There were no dark thoughts of killing or destruction in his heart, only a sense of awe and admiration at witnessing the Great Dao. "This is true formations." "What is deduced is ultimately different from what is seen in reality, with subtle differences." "Let me see if the Dharma Transmitter, Heavenly Physician, and others can survive in this immortal formation..." As the saying goes, spilled water cannot be retrieved. Once this grand formation was completed, even if Sun Tianci, as the "power source," discovered it and wanted to stop it, he would be powerless. Only he, the one who set up the formation, could make minor adjustments during the activation process, but he could not reverse the entire process. Li Fan sensed the Dharma Transmitter and others still searching for his trace in the Xuanhuang Realm, and coldly snorted. He was ready to activate the grand formation at any time. ... After searching fruitlessly several times, the Saint Emperor released the Dao Yi spiritual energy he had absorbed back into the Xuanhuang heavens and earth, pondering a solution. The unease in the Saint Emperor's heart had reached its peak. The Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate was also in the same state. Finally, as if making a decision, the Dharma Transmitter's figure briefly disappeared and then reappeared. With a solemn expression, he held an ancient bronze mirror. The Saint Emperor's pupils contracted. He could sense a faint aura of Immortal Essence from this mirror. "The true form of the Heavenly Profound Mirror?" The Dharma Transmitter tossed the Heavenly Profound Mirror high into the sky. The ancient bronze mirror grew with the wind, and its ephemeral body instantly covered the entire Xuanhuang Realm. The celestial canopy disappeared, replaced by the mirror surface covering everyone's heads. Beneath the Heavenly Profound Mirror, even the Saint Emperor felt a sense of being completely exposed. Instinctively, starlight enveloped him, obscuring the Heavenly Profound Mirror's vision. Two lines, one black and one white, interwove and emitted from the surface of the Heavenly Profound Mirror. They extended infinitely, instantly encompassing the Xuanhuang Realm. Then, continuous black and white lines swept across. As the black and white lines swept across and merged into the Xuanhuang heavens and earth, the Heavenly Profound Mirror above also slowly revealed the scene of the Xuanhuang Realm. Not only mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas, but also all living beings within them. Only the Saint Emperor, the Dharma Transmitter, and others were not included. However, as the black and white lines continued to sweep, the Saint Emperor's figure also gradually appeared within the Heavenly Profound Mirror. The Saint Emperor looked up at his blurry image in the mirror. For some reason, he felt that the figure was subtly different from his real self. The Xuanhuang Realm seemed to have fallen into a state of stillness, awaiting the results of the Heavenly Profound Mirror's search. Only the Heavenly Physician's golden needles continued to move, traversing the Xuanhuang great land, as if trying to completely restore the Xuanhuang Realm to its pre-war state. The scene within the Heavenly Profound Mirror became clearer and clearer. Various locations were ruled out. The Dharma Transmitter had already begun to search the remaining areas. The Saint Emperor was also doing the same. The former enemies had now tacitly cooperated once again. After all, whether the Xuanhuang Realm evolved into the Dharma Transmission Realm or not, the existence of the world beneath their feet was the prerequisite for everything. Just as Li Fan's hiding place deep beneath Tongyan Prefecture was about to be exposed, a figure quietly appeared outside the Great Qi's small world, unnoticed by anyone. In the void, blocked by layers of formations set up by the Saint Emperor. Within it, sealed and carefully placed by the Saint Emperor, was... The ruins of the Yi Shi Sect, carrying the Mielu Wind Calamity and the remains of the Grand Master. And, a faceless stone statue. That figure was another avatar of Li Fan. Previously, after separating from the fabricated personality of the Infinite Mirror and using the Dharma Derivation Jade to deduce the Harmonious Dao cultivation technique and cause trouble within the Myriad Immortals Alliance, this avatar had been in hiding. It had been silently waiting for an opportunity. Now, he had finally waited for his chance. "After such meticulous planning for so long, how can I allow it to be disturbed at the last moment?" "Bring them back for me..." Facing the obstruction of the layers of formations, Li Fan's avatar ignored them all and flashed directly into the formation. At the same time. The Saint Emperor's expression changed drastically within the Xuanhuang Realm. He had already sensed the figure that had quietly appeared outside the Great Qi's small world. He felt a sense of familiarity that made his heart tremble! Without delay, starlight pierced the heavens and descended directly into the Sacred Chao Great Qi. Then, he urgently fled towards the void outside. However, it was already too late. In the previous moment, Li Fan's avatar had already instantly deciphered all the formations. The items placed on either side were then gathered together. The avatar detonated itself, leaving no trace. Using the last bit of power from the avatar's explosion, it fiercely swept the faceless stone statue towards the ruins of the Yi Shi Sect. Just as the stone statue was about to collide with the ruins of the Yi Shi Sect, the remaining avatar, transformed into a sharp sword, directly slashed at the head of the faceless stone statue! Boom! Boom! Boom! Although it looked like an ordinary stone statue, the moment the avatar's sword collided with the stone statue, a power descended as if instantaneously. There was no obstruction to the desecration of the stone statue, as if it had merely glanced at it casually from afar. But because of this action, it attracted the attention of... the Mielu Wind Calamity lurking within the ruins of the Yi Shi Sect. The being residing in the stone statue disappeared instantly. However, the terrifying Mielu Wind Calamity did not stop. A storm slowly began to form in the void outside the Great Qi's small world. The Saint Emperor's figure, arriving a step too late. The storm had already engulfed the entire ruins of the Yi Shi Sect. The terrifying energy fluctuations, even from afar, made this Supreme Realm expert feel an infinite sense of crisis. It was like a weak mortal facing a world-destroying catastrophe. There was nothing he could do but watch. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and the Saint Emperor quickly regained his senses. Without any reservations, he summoned all his golden Origin Force essence, attempting to prevent the spread of the Mielu Wind Calamity. At the same time, countless Rift Breaking Whales emerged from the Sacred Dynasty, cutting off the void where the wind calamity was located from the Sacred Chao Great Qi. The Origin Force essence, infinitely close to True Immortal power, was no match for this Mielu Wind Calamity. It shattered upon contact. The Saint Emperor could not retreat and could only continue to try and block the wind calamity with the Origin Force essence. A beam of white light also blocked the path of the spreading Mielu Wind Calamity. The one who arrived was a tall figure with a high crown and long beard, holding a bronze mirror. It was the Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate. The Dharma Transmitter's expression was also unprecedentedly grim, no longer calm. And the Heavenly Profound Mirror in his hand was flashing warnings as if it had seen something extremely terrifying. The Saint Emperor transmitted the scene he had just sensed of the Yi Shi Sect ruins being triggered to the Dharma Transmitter. The Dharma Transmitter did not say much, only manipulated the Heavenly Profound Mirror to emit ancient green rays of light, attempting to seal the Mielu Wind Calamity. Even with the combined efforts of the two Supremes, they were still unable to completely block the Mielu Wind Calamity. This terrifying wind calamity seemed capable of devouring everything. Even the void was its target for annihilation. Following the loopholes in the Dharma Transmitter and Saint Emperor’s defensive line, the wind calamity, like a rolling tide, engulfed everything in its path and headed towards the Xuanhuang Realm. Once the wind calamity erupted in the Xuanhuang Realm, all living beings within, including the Xuanhuang Realm itself, would likely be destroyed by this tribulation from the immortal world. Just then, several golden needles suddenly came from afar. Like unmoving pillars, they formed an indestructible dam, firmly blocking the Mielu Wind Calamity that had slipped through the net! The wind calamity raged, and the light of the golden needles dimmed. Soon, the dam collapsed, and the wind calamity continued to surge forward. However, in front of it, countless golden needles followed closely behind, forming a continuous series of wind-blocking dams, obstructing the path of the terrifying wind calamity. A benevolent old man, with the arrival of the golden needles, also appeared in the void. As if performing a difficult medical treatment, the old man's expression was solemn, and he continuously shot needles. At the same time, he unleashed streams of light, landing within the Mielu Wind Calamity ahead. The Saint Emperor saw from afar that those lights seemed to be extremely old objects, carrying an aura of silence and coldness. After falling into the wind calamity, they seemed to attract the wind calamity, causing it to gather and surround them, forming small whirlpools. The appearance of the whirlpools absorbed most of the energy of the wind calamity. Thus, this terrifying calamity that erupted from the void outside the Great Qi's small world began to show signs of weakening. The benevolent old man did not show any signs of relief because of this; instead, he became even more cautious. The golden needles in his hand did not stop, and he continuously shot them out, completely sealing those whirlpools. With a slight force in his hand, accompanied by a pulling sound, the wind calamity whirlpools were captured by the old man along the golden threads. His mouth opened slightly, and he actually swallowed the golden needle seals containing the Mielu Wind Calamity into his abdomen! The Dharma Transmitter seemed accustomed to this. The Saint Emperor, however, showed a look of shock. It seemed that this Heavenly Physician's strength was even superior to his and the Dharma Transmitter's. In the Heavenly Physician's eyes, besides the wind calamity, there seemed to be nothing else. He completely ignored the Dharma Transmitter and the Saint Emperor. One golden needle after another fell, slowly sealing and swallowing all the Mielu Wind Calamity into his abdomen. This action was by no means an easy task for the Heavenly Physician. Every so often, he needed to take a short rest. Fortunately, with the combined efforts of the three Supremes, they finally managed to extinguish this world-ending tribulation in its infancy. Looking at the void that had returned to calm, the Saint Emperor, somewhat exhausted, still felt a lingering sense of dread. If this extermination calamity had erupted directly in the Xuanhuang Realm, rather than in the void, they might not have been able to save it in time. As the Saint Emperor was contemplating this, he suddenly noticed that the Dharma Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician, who had resolved the calamity, were still standing in the void with stern expressions. Their gaze was not directed at the Xuanhuang Realm, nor at the Saint Emperor's location. Instead, it was directed at... a blurry Dao child phantom that had appeared at some unknown time! The Dao child stood silently with his eyes closed. It seemed as if he did not see the others present. However, the Dharma Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician regarded him as if facing an extremely formidable enemy. "Grand Master Tiandu?" The Saint Emperor was startled in his heart. He recalled the remains of the Grand Master within the Yi Shi Sect ruins encountered earlier, which had now completely vanished into the Mielu Wind Calamity. He never expected... that it would attract the appearance of this legendary Grand Master! The Grand Master's realm had already transcended the current limits of the star sea. It transcended the so-called Supreme. Although it was merely a phantom, the Saint Emperor could not discern whether it was real or illusory. Judging by the expressions on the faces of the Dharma Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician, they were also greatly shaken by the sudden appearance of this Grand Master. The Grand Master remained motionless, and the Dharma Transmitter and others dared not act rashly. For a moment, a stalemate ensued. However, the Saint Emperor sensed that the progress of the formation being assembled in the Xuanhuang Realm was still continuing nearby. Just as the Saint Emperor decided to disregard the Grand Master in front of him and return to the Xuanhuang Realm to continue searching for the mastermind, a voice suddenly came from above the Grand Master's phantom. The three Supremes' hearts tightened, and they listened attentively. "Dao, ancient. Xin, annihilation." "Xing Nian Xiu, Tong Yi, Wang Shen." "..." Initially, the words sounded incomprehensible and nonsensical. But as they listened, a glimmer of understanding suddenly flashed through the Saint Emperor's heart. This was actually an immortal scripture!</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning to Truth Ultimately Brings Reality (7K)</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A thousand lines of soul shifting, a hundred turns of spirit transmuting."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No blame."</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusory figure's transmission of the Dao continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not through sound or divine sense, but directly resounding in everyone's minds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the Saint Emperor, Dharma Transmitter, and Heavenly Physician present, though deeply concerned about the safety of the Xuanhuang Realm, were uncontrollably drawn into the immortal incantation spoken by the Dao child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only when the immortal incantation was finished and the Dao child's illusory form became even more blurred, its voice faint and indistinct, did the three regain their senses, covered in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They exchanged glances, tacitly flying backward, away from the Dao child's illusory form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dao child's illusory form did not stop them, as if its mission had been completed, allowing the three to depart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The voice of the Dao transmission grew weaker and weaker. Finally, it disappeared into the void along with the Dao child's illusory form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three watched this scene, their expressions subtle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They pondered the reason for the illusory figure's sudden appearance to transmit the Dao, and its subsequent vanishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, the three were savoring the immortal incantation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immortal incantations differed from mortal cultivation methods, being extremely arduous and obscure. Especially since the Dao child's illusory form simply recited the incantation's content directly, without any explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the Saint Emperor and the others could be said to have reached the pinnacle of comprehension in the mortal realm, wanting to understand an entire immortal incantation in such a short time was a bit of a stretch. They could only guess at the general idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not a cultivation method, but an incantation for avoiding disaster. Within it, there also seems to be some recording of the Immortal Realm…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's mind raced, but his movements did not stop. He returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter followed closely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the Heavenly Physician, he had disappeared at some unknown time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Casting a casual glance towards the direction of the Dao Source State of Xuanhuang Realm, the Saint Emperor did not sense the aura of Heavenly All Awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even as Xuanhuang Realm is about to be destroyed, it remains unmoved."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yet it took the initiative to show itself just now…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is it because of the erasure of the Wind Calamity?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though his heart was filled with questions, this was not the time for deep investigation. Many thoughts flashed by, and the Saint Emperor focused on the current state of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside Xuanhuang Realm, an endless rain of golden needles continued to fall. However, the power released after the golden needles landed had undergone a subtle change compared to before. With a glance, the Saint Emperor discerned a trace of the reason. If before it was administering a strong medicine during a critical illness, now it was conditioning after recovering from a serious illness. The power of the golden needles was much gentler and soothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Faint thunder rumbled, and continuous light rain fell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the Awakening of Insects, when all things revived and flourished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The tumultuous Xuanhuang Realm surprisingly presented a scene of vibrant life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If not for the hidden, faintly discernible aura of a great formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Worthy of the name [Heavenly Physician], it had actually, in such a short time, relied solely on golden needles to forcefully restore the Xuanhuang Realms that had entered fusion. Making the Xuanhuang heavens and earth repeat its original appearance. What was even more commendable was that the heavens and earth themselves had not suffered any damage as a result.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Healing the Heavens as Heals a Man, the golden needles reversed life and death. Wanting to reach such a realm could not be accomplished solely through high cultivation level. It also required a full understanding of the essence of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor, who had once merged with the Heavens and had an extremely close connection with the heavens and earth, now knew in his heart. He would definitely not be able to reach the level of the Heavenly Physician.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But even a figure like the Heavenly Physician cannot find the mastermind behind the scenes…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Emperor's heart was extremely heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since returning from the void outside Great Qi, the Xuanhuang Realm felt increasingly ominous to the Saint Emperor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before, it was water boiling in a pot, but now it was only a line away from the water boiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anytime that quality change might be achieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Physician sensed it as well, no longer holding back, and finally made their moves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the heavenly cities of each state, at the location where the statue of the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerable originally stood. Now, regardless of whether the statue still existed, with spatial vibrations, a illusory giant Dharma body appeared, overlaying the original one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like points of light that lit up one after another, shining on a large part of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the Five Elders Assembly, five different colored dots of light lit up at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Six colors, strung together into lines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the meridians of the Xuanhuang Realm, shining brightly in broad daylight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Soul Sealing!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Realm Replacement!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Heavenly Physician's stern voice echoed through the heavens and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma's body again practiced Dharma's Body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Heavenly Physician vaguely appeared on the top of the Dharma's body’s head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then his right hand pinched a seven-colored needle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a solemn expression, he pierced it into the Dharma Transmitting’s hundred meeting acupoint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma's body instantly erupted with a dazzling seven-colored light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, like melting, flowed like light towards the constantly flashing meridians of the Xuanhuang Realm below.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Silently, the seven-colored light looped a full circle the moment it flowed into the meridians of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of stillness, the seven-colored light flowed through the meridians again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Soul Sealing Realm Replacement?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is the Heavenly Physician temporarily sealing the soul of the Dharma Transmitter, importing it into the Xuanhuang heavens</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-315" class="calibre1">Chapter 1303: Looking Back and Reviewing</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Anchor at three years, peak of Jieli Mountain."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, who was in seclusion, suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His state of mind was disturbed, and he could no longer maintain his calm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He let out a long sigh, slowly rose, and walked out of the wooden house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He stood at the cliff's edge, gazing into the sea of clouds, the mountain wind rustling his robes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a full half a day, Li Fan's state of mind finally calmed down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the past three years, this scene had not been the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Li Fan successfully "returned to truth" to anchor 1 year ago, the experiences of past reincarnations still deeply affected him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not a passive influence, like being caught in the True Immortal's web, but rather a problem with Li Fan's own mindset.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra protecting him, he could not escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whenever his mind quieted down, the scene of the cat treasure leaping out of the darkness and swallowing the True Immortal's phantom would suddenly emerge from the depths of his memory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Breaking into a cold sweat, his mind became chaotic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He could no longer maintain a state of tranquility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Cat treasure, cat treasure..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's gaze flickered, and he repeatedly muttered these two words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cat treasure, despite possessing powers such as item duplication, creature mimicry, and marrow cleansing, was only of white quality when fished out of the Fishing Pond.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Fishing Pond was subtly the creation of an unnamed True Immortal who had comprehended the Dao of Fishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And how could the cat treasure, capable of deceiving the Fishing Pond, be simple?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cat treasure's consumption of refined origin essence as food also indicated its extraordinary nature to some extent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, neither the Saint Emperor, who considered himself a player, nor Li Fan, who believed himself to be the strategist, had expected...</p>
<p class="calibre2">That the cat treasure would be such a terrifying creation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immortal energy could be wielded like True Immortals themselves. Even if it was just a phantom, it could effortlessly suppress the "Immortal Descent, All Things Return to Void" great array that shattered Xuanhuang Realm. In stark contrast, the three Taishang realm powerhouses of the Star Sea could barely survive within the immortal array even with their utmost efforts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The gap between Taishang and True Immortal was immeasurable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the cat treasure, capable of swallowing a True Immortal's phantom in one bite...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its true strength was unimaginable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, Li Fan "returned to truth" amidst the chaos of the Star Sea's instability and the crumbling of the high wall. The impact caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, Li Fan's clone in the immortal array's core, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the deeper reason why Li Fan could not truly calm his mind for the past three years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the final moments of the previous life, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out.

<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>

<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>

These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a major upheaval that the Utmost Darkness Star Sea had not experienced in ten thousand years since the severing of the immortal path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a chaotic and perilous situation, due to his decisiveness and alertness, Li Fan had indeed successfully "returned to truth" and returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>

<p class="calibre2">However, the scenes he experienced during the return to truth this time were different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The normal vision of returning to truth involved the surrounding scenery dimming, as if covered by a layer of mist, making it unclear. After returning to truth, all scenes would freeze, shatter, and fly into one's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When facing extreme threats, such as when Xuanhuang was annihilated by a True Immortal's gaze in the Immortal Ruins, or when a faceless True Immortal sought him out. These powerful beings could move within the frozen scene surrounding the return to truth, but at a very slow pace, as if Li Fan and the space outside were in different time dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the vision Li Fan experienced in the previous life was completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene outside the return to truth seemed to remain frozen as if unaffected, but the surrounding scenery, as if wrapped in fog, would flicker intermittently. It was like an old television signal losing its reception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan's mind was almost blank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had no means to counter; he could only await his final fate as if undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The return to truth was ultimately successful, and he, Li Fan, once again returned to Anchor Year 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes, Li Fan was almost exhausted, drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan drew his file, and the perfectly carved cat sculpture was instantly ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan tossed it aside, took out another piece of wood, and began carving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was using wood carving to confront the deep-seated fear in his heart, in an attempt to eliminate the influence the cat treasure had on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did have some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The frequency with which Li Fan woke up from nightmares about the cat treasure had greatly reduced compared to three years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan knew very well that it would take a long time to truly resolve this "inner demon."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also decided to take this opportunity to review and ponder thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, during the final moments, the Star Sea was in turmoil. The impact of the crumbling high wall caused many powerful cultivators who had survived the world-ending immortal array to be unable to bear it and perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, in the immortal array's core, Li Fan's clone, utilizing the array's residual power, vaguely sensed. The turmoil of the Star Sea was not entirely due to the crumbling of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was also caused by the sudden descent of some entity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a giant rock falling into a deep pool, stirring up countless ripples, it had stirred up monstrous waves in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, which had already been turbulent!</p>

<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-316" class="calibre1">Chapter 1304: Still Really Changed</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Changes Are Real (7K, Seeking Monthly Tickets!)</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan should have been unable to embark on the path of cultivation. Originally, when traveling from Great Xuan to Azure Glass Island, the removal of the Immortal-Mortal Taint within his body almost completely severed his path to cultivation. Fortunately, with the double blessing of the Xuanhuang Heart-Cleansing Mantra and the Cleansing Spirit Pool, he was able to formally begin cultivating.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And as he shed his taint, the Xuanhuang Heart-Cleansing Mantra officially transformed into the Xuanhuang Heart-Tempering Mantra. The Xuanhuang Mantra thus became his unique Dao foundation, accompanying him throughout his cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The higher Li Fan's cultivation, the more the Xuanhuang Mantra Dao foundation expanded. Like pillars, it became an important part supporting Li Fan's cultivation. However, in the previous life, when Li Fan spread the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra on a large scale, the consequence was that these Dao foundation pillars... Became weakened due to excessive division.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His main body's Dao foundation was not only the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra but also included the [Returning to Truth] and the experiences gained from a hundred lifetimes. Therefore, the impact was minimal. However, this negative effect brought about by the separation was naturally amplified in his clones and divided spirits. The weaker the separated entity, the more evident it became.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't just him who was affected by the widespread dissemination of the Immortal Heart Mantra. Even the Immortal Heart Mantra itself became less effective because of this spread. This could be indirectly seen from the performance of the Azure Profound Army and the Great Qi Forbidden Army, who cultivated the Immortal Heart Mantra in the previous life, during the great battles. They barely managed to remain calm in the face of danger, but they were far from achieving the [Enduring a Thousand Lifetimes of Tribulation, Yet the Immortal Heart Remains Unchanged] as described in the orthodox Immortal Heart Mantra!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The difference became even clearer when Li Fan returned to the truth in this life and solely possessed the Immortal Heart Mantra once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Dao cannot be cultivated simultaneously..." "It seems that it's not just the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao suppressing the sudden evolution of cultivators. But rather, it's something that has been deeply imprinted in the depths of the Xuanhuang Realm, originating from some tradition in the Immortal Realm." "Hmm, perhaps it's not just about the Dao not being cultivated simultaneously. It's also closely related to the position of the Great Heavenly Venerate of Xuanhuang."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Undoubtedly, the Immortal Heart Mantra that Mister White passed on to the world to counteract the power of twisting the Xuanhuang's inverse principles, its origin should be from the Great Heavenly Venerate of Xuanhuang. The Great Heavenly Venerate of Xuanhuang, appointed by the Immortal Realm, wielded Immortal Artifacts and oversaw Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Realm of Xuanhuang, it could be said to possess unparalleled authority. However, this Great Heavenly Venerate of the Immortal Realm was not so easy to become. Not only was there a colleague of the [Overseer] type secretly restraining it, but inheriting the position of Great Heavenly Venerate also meant inheriting the Immortal Realm's constraints and punishments on the Great Heavenly Venerate of Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After Returning to Truth to this life, when Li Fan reviewed everything, he finally remembered Sun Tianci, who was burned to ashes by the Fire of Heart Burning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even though the Immortal Path is now severed, the Immortal Realm's countermeasures are still effective." "The Immortal Heart Mantra cannot be spread on a large scale, I'm afraid it's one of the Immortal Realm's various restrictions on the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then recalled what happened after Sun Tianci successfully took office in the previous life. "The Golden Bell of the Great Sun, the Azure Nether Lantern of the Vast Void, the Purple Qi Dream-Weaving Shuttle, the Primal Chaos Five Elements Wheel." These four were the only remaining Immortal Artifacts of the Xuanhuang Realm's Great Heavenly Venerate heritage.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, there was a condensed mass of Immortal Spirit Power, originating from those Immortal Artifacts that Mister White detonated. "After completing the Immortalfall Realm's test, there's still a probationary period before truly becoming the Great Heavenly Venerate of Xuanhuang." "Before the Immortal Path was severed, this probationary period was actually the time to wait for the Immortal Realm to review and appoint." "Now that the Immortal Path is severed, the Immortal Realm's appointment has become empty talk. However, according to the procedure set by the Immortal Realm, if there is no response from the Immortal Realm within three years, then the review is automatically passed. Generally speaking, as long as one doesn't encounter something like Sun Tianci, like the destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm. As long as one silently waits for time to pass, one can obtain the full authority of the Great Heavenly Venerate." "But before that..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One cannot use the Immortal Artifacts in the Great Heavenly Venerate's legacy. This was one of the reasons why Li Fan's Divided Spirit easily persuaded Sun Tianci in the previous life. In the face of an oppressive Law-Transmitting Heavenly Venerable, the newly appointed Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate simply didn't have the ability to contend with him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to Sun Tianci, there are no artifact spirits inside these Immortal Artifacts bestowed by the Upper Realm. The Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate of the Lower Realm has no Immortal Spirit Power and can only rely on the restrictions left by the Immortal Realm to expend the Immortal Artifact's own power to drive them." "In a sense, they are unabashed consumables. When Mister White collected them one by one, it's hard to say how many times these Immortal Artifacts had already been used. It's really hard to say how much power is left." "But after all, they are Immortal Artifacts. It's no different than letting treasures gather dust if they're not used in the Immortalfall Realm. In this life, they still have to be retrieved. Not to mention that there is also that mass of pure Immortal Spirit Power."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having personally used Immortal Spirit Power to set up the world-destroying Immortal Array, Li Fan truly understood the power and transcendence of [Immortals].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within his sea of consciousness, the Terminus Disintegration Disc radiated an extraordinary seven-colored light. Within the radiance, a true [Immortal Array] was being deduced non-stop. Immortal array birth, Immortal array operation, Immortal array destruction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">During the process of the All Things Return to Void Array destroying the world in the previous life, the Terminus Disintegration Disc collected sufficient array data. As if it had truly completed the transformation between Immortal and Mortal, it could now spontaneously deduce Immortal Arrays according to Li Fan's needs, just like deducing Mortal Arrays.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the deduction speed was extremely slow and the load on the Disintegration Disc was extremely high. But under the orderly arrangement of the Disintegration Disc's simulated personalities, it would not affect Li Fan's normal cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, the main direction of the Terminus Disintegration Disc's immortal array deduction was Immortal Array downgrading. At the cost of slightly reducing the array's power, they hoped to drive it with a slightly lower level of energy. The immortal and Mortal were different and there was no way to create Immortal Spirit Power on a large scale. Therefore at present this main route was best in theory. Even if he could harvest some from the Great Heavenly Venerate's legacy, it would not be enough to support Li Fan's plan in this life. But the Source Power Essence, which was infinitely close to Immortal Spirit Power, was almost inexhaustible for him. If he could achieve driving immortal arrays with Origin Power Essence, it would undoubtedly save a lot of trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if Law Transmitter and Heavenly Physician returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, he could handle them easily. He would no longer need to create a Saint Emperor clone so laboriously to compete with them. In the previous life's doomsday world array, Li Fan had a clear understanding of the true strength of Law Transmitter and Heavenly Physician. With a baseline of established strength, he can consider himself familiar with how to deal with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As long as I don't push them to the brink, with the Immortal Array as guarantee, it would be alright to invite them to have a good talk, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A transparent shadow flashed before Li Fan's eyes after his main body was obliterated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">During the doomsday storm at that time he could observe a little bit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he felt a faint familiar aura from that transparent shadow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There is an opportunity in this life, maybe I can verify it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">When True Immortals descended, everything in the Xuanhuang Realm was like ants. The Cat Treasure leaped out, and was able to swallow even the True Immortal's Mirage.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The gap between Xuanhuang Realm and the outer barrier became apparent. But that did not mean everything in Xuanhuang Realm lost its value. When Li Fan was Mortal Grand Tutor, the gap between himself and the Immortals of Xuanhuang was the same as the gap between Xuanhuang Realm and the star wall today.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, after going through an iteration for more than hundred times, Li Fan had already made Xuanhuang a chess piece. What if those beyond the barrier were to somehow be obtained? If he could experience that, maybe there would be a way to reverse things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly suppressed the thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, these would come later. For now, the best course of action was to remain well-prepared. With that thought, he created a perfect statue. "This should it, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the file in his mind, the perfectly sculpted sculpture turned to ashes, and Li Fan threw it away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan retrieved another piece of wood, and began creating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was making wood carvings to face the deeply embed fear in his heart, trying to push the Treasure Cat out of his mind. There was some effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"> The number of nightmares regarding the Treasure Cat were beginning to lessen, but he knew it would take some time to get past this. He also planned to reflect.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When it came to the end, the high wall collapsed, leading to the downfall of many powerful cultivators, and only the clone utilizing the array power was able to do something. How was there to say, his feelings were simply that with the great array, things were not entirely bad. It was the method to deal the Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though his cultivation might be slower, it was the best route. He could look into matters. It was almost 127 iterations from the start. That meant he'd gotten through more than one. Then, suddenly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Anchor at three years, peak of Jieli Mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The words entered his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The state of mind he was in was disturbed to the point he could barely keep it together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he took his tools. A perfect statue came to be. Xu Fan and the others should be at their destination.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait until I've secured my authority to find the others."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was more mindful to the power now. He was able to touch upon aspects he had not before. Power was a tool that had its own applications. A sudden voice broke him from his train of thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What did you see?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are those that cannot be seen… If one looks too deeply, they risk…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">It came from further ahead. It was a place he knew well. He was now prepared. To set up the formation he had before.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Right, if the war was starting now, he'd best get moving. Sun Erlang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Looks like it's come faster than I thought."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">That was too bad. He had not been able to find anyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And, this time for sure… He needed strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I need it, or I may not be ready at all."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Army, the elite that would see the Sacred Dynasty rise for all that was coming. Then, just where should they start?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't as simple to just start moving. There were things to test. They needed time to be ready. Sun erlang's expression turned solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I won't give any order for us to throw our lives away. We will win. We will survive this."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And that would give them time. More than them, it seemed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Still not ready, hmm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I still need another."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What he needed was an anchor point. An understanding. A bond.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They all thought they had the answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as it came to be, what would follow?</p>
<p class="calibre2">He could feel it. All of it getting closer</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But no, wait.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He turned to the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now it was getting more and more interesting as everything unraveled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This has some kind of feel of an interesting game about to begin"</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was plenty of action to be had. Plenty to consider. He would do so and consider. And, make the plan, for it all. At that time just the path would be free.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I will survive, right up to the very end."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His goal was set. He would take what must be gathered, and prepare to make the correct choice. Soon, the pieces for their side would be in effect. And in play. And then things would properly ramp up. That wasn't all that would happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Time enough remained. The chess pieces were being set. Or had they already been made? There had been some thought on the matter. Then, in another universe.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They may very well be more. He could try to gather them, but not just now, no.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Right well, I need that power to make my way as well."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was being a bit greedy, he thought. That was something to reign in at all. He had many of this to test. And as it came and went, there would need to be a time where it was right. The universe or the multi universe. He would need the means for it all. That said, and set…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Time could be of an essence here or there, to know something would need to come to play . In time. He thought, looking for this thing that might have been. His mind was on it. He could see it was so.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even to those that had helped the past there were strings to pull. To cut things he need but would there really be an end at all? From the infinite. That was for all to see and know. For what really he thought or felt? That was up to him. There were limits though. So, he best not force any hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It will have to be more than luck this time to be sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With whatever tools he could acquire. He needed to be smart as hell.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It all started and ended with the core. The soul</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Right, who am I kidding… It's only luck so far."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And it would be so for a while to come. He needed it. And he needed to make use of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The situation became clear it would be best to consider it at all cost. He might be able to do things if they were ready now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">So, for now, he would put it away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">So, it seemed a test run was necessary. "That won't do at all."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The whole plan seemed to fall to pieces… But it could also work. So, all the pieces set. At last. Well, that was to set the chess that needed to be. Others, where doing their setting. Some as him, and others against. If all would end, it would be as fate may spin the wheel.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, there was so much to go from here. "It's not enough now, I need the strength first"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a long road indeed. Very long at that.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">First. He needed what he needed. In time. He would.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He would think more on everything before doing what followed. The plan this time would be made to be more concise. He had the skill to do so. That, and he trusted none. So, it would be left to him. In its majority. Again. He didn't mind. This was simply what he had to do after whatever was to unfold. Too bad really.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These guys would be good to work with if they were not what he knew.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Time needed to move. Nothing was moving. Things and people, it was all getting odd. Then, from there he would be moving around. The plan started the moment he knew what next to do. Still, he felt there was little more than knowing the path ahead. More, he feared someone walking toward him. This world might have been big but it was small as compared to the rest.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Well… In enough time, sure I'll get on it when it is done."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He laughed. These thoughts were running circles around his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now then, I want to end these thoughts"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And begin setting out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He would keep some distance from people. But still watch. That seemed to be his only option.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With some words, whatever this was may actually hold still. To what it took to get out he would.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The thing with having a plan or not, was how far did all that go? No point in holding on to more. Still, there was time for all of what would be. All that said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To where they were, the wind was calm. Right now it seemed time. A few steps forward and what was there to face but to trust himself. The best plan that could never be for one did not make the choice. He would. So what was needed?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A few things to be had. But first…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait there"</p>
<p class="calibre2">He would need that guy on their side if what he thought it was. He wouldn't say things out loud. But it was what it was.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He would follow and help for now but there was a path.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long time the steps needed to come.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There needed to be something more to it than that. When to take or not was still something to weigh. But he had had the need to do so for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If nothing else he would wait.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To feel something and make whatever decision. The right, choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And whatever came after. That plan was his only tool. Now, if that much was done. Well then, he wait as he may and see to what would come.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Time seemed to freeze every step of the way as new revelations were being gained. Would that stop or simply pause for whatever might show itself when it may?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hah… Seems it wants that still, so there."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He shrugged.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A few steps away now until the point where he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">So be it. The world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It would tremble. It would be so.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And only a few more years until a turn. What would come of it? At all?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If the cycle changed with him then the results better had shown so.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For good this would be the last time. He would make for now. At once everything set the only path of hope would need take stride</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As it was. So simple. That was what it needed to be. He was now at.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It. There was still an exit left. It was to find that one. Then be, it so.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All of the planning to come to this end all with that one goal in mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To become what must when even when the self disappears, the intent stands. He didn't even know if that made any sense. It didn't have to. It only happened. Was. Is now to be seen when what was always done might actually need to be so with no choice beyond?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then again. Where was the choice that would actually change destiny?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not by words, or deeds, but only by what has never been. That path would be his to take and see.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then. He had the one. He had the time. Set, go.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Here there not. To be continued. That would be his.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The last step was to take the stage. When a final push had made all right at all. When just being, when all was put to what to be with not to choose when the heart must see.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He started carving again. His mind set. A new path he would now make.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was an entity that was about to arise. That entity was him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now. With his purpose. Was just a moment. The entity opened his eyes to what was. All, must do so now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"See? Ha… I've done it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There the moment for him was. But to where it needed came and went to see this day set free again. He started once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A new test. A challenge. A path to see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The plan began. In a different light for now!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He still needed the strength to keep it going. But he had to get up. So, one deep breath.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One, two for three, his purpose shown. What would come after?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He could hear. That was to have the choice or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The stage was set. One last time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Here he stood now. As it should. His hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The power as he knew. Then knew no more to that which was his.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the end"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was off to see. What did stand by all the tests he had made as of yet?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This would be the mark he needed to climb across the walls of what he had known?</p>
<p class="calibre2">What came from a power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He did not know. But would find out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At all costs? Or for what? He couldn't say.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to do it. His hand he held now as new pieces for him appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And what were they now? There and seen. The last pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">That, was all then.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a smile he started, and began carving with. That and what else? What was known to only him? And where to test? So be it. Then. He would try.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Would see. All things.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With the plan. As of now set, no time was to waste. At least did he feel so. Here to where he wanted done. What steps might be to follow?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then again, in what form must his purpose carry forth? I do not know, I will not pretend.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But must I see that, then here goes. All to do, it. All again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then what would be the next? If I knew maybe all was set. It was not. But that doesn't stop what must happen just there at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The last steps had been taken. The long nights and trials to be had.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only what was right for he for now that one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now begin carving."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He began moving once more to take that stage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It must to be. For something. For now. The time, for it has stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The words came to enter, the end of time,</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not, that time will do so to try again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Would he be strong enough to bare the weight?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let us see how that will go.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">【Detected new variable effects, you can now chose an extra attribute to retain?】</p>
<p class="calibre2">【Would you like to retain:</p>

<p class="calibre2">Or</p>
<p class="calibre2">四- Give it up all, to move the wheel?】</p>
<p class="calibre2">李凡 thought everything needed as he thought was to be tested.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All the words was he as ever set the things that were going what can come or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This to him was what held up this time of when it finally all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The things which came to. Make or do with. Would not all this to set before in line. These things to say. Not do that now but did it and there was more set more like it as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All thing to. Set or keep it so it will. Come so to let by whatever thing there was all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then so. Set so done. All too for one to to have knew things all. It all was set what that might set on too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, came he, at all. With all these to see which things may had been done for too.</p>

<p class="calibre2">李凡目光闪动，继续思索还真这额外的提醒。</p>
<p class="calibre2">“变量干扰，是相对于我既定的计划而言的。也就是说，这个【变量】，会直接影响到我既定的计划，使得我无法以期望的方式进行。”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“而还真这么想要吞噬的话，恐怕不是什么好事。”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“甚至有可能是会打破轮回平衡，给我带来无法想象的灾难。”</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">White Circle Descends to the Mortal Realm</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the real is treated as the false, the false becomes real."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The change between truth and falsehood holds infinite mystery~"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan recited the words in his heart once more, filled with joy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it only lasted for a moment, he had indeed "conjured" the Nascent Divinity cultivation of his previous life out of thin air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as it was his first attempt at this great divine power, the cultivation that had been transformed flickered like a dream bubble, disappearing in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was not discouraged by this, but remained exceedingly delighted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To create something from nothing in the void, even legendary True Immortals might not be able to achieve that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he was able to accomplish it in a preliminary fashion, with insight gained from multiple [Returning to Truth] simulations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the saying goes, everything is hard at the beginning. With this first success, in the future, he would surely become more and more familiar with wielding this divine power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not just my own cultivation. The objects I have experienced and possessed, and even…"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Each and every different person, the Xuanhuang Realm, the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, and the entirety beyond the High Wall. One day, all of them can be re-manifested with a single thought!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stood above the sea of clouds, savoring the sensation when wielding the Transformation of Truth and Falsehood, his heart surging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took a long time before he finally recovered from his epiphany.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the inheritance options on the Returning to Truth Panel, he first chose to inherit his cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The same scene replayed, with continuous rumbling in the sky above Great Xuan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was caused by the invisible infusion of Li Fan's Nascent Divinity cultivation into the small world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, compared to the scene when he inherited his cultivation in the previous life, Great Xuan Small World, due to its world transformation caused by the [Creation] True Immortal Seal character earlier, did not show any signs of being unable to bear the burden.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It merely had dense dark clouds and various strange phenomena.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hoo…" When the familiar power of cultivation returned to his body, Li Fan let out a long sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, his gaze locked onto the second inheritance option.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The inherit cultivation option had become dim, leaving only options 1, 3, and 4.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without hesitation, Li Fan chose to inherit items.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The items he possessed in the experiences of his previous life, including those of his divided spirits and his true body, all instantly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Waiting for him to quietly select.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His gaze swept over them slightly, and after pondering for a moment, he finally settled on a plain-looking white circle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before it was fished up, the Saint Emperor had not completely separated from Li Fan's main body, so the white circle was also regarded as an item he once possessed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After selecting and confirming, the light in his hand flickered, and finally condensed into a simple white circle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It felt slightly cool to the touch. When divine sense swept over it, no fluctuations of spiritual energy could be sensed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that because it was transformed by [Returning to Truth], there was no need to refine it to acknowledge its master. While holding the white circle, Li Fan already had a sense of being able to freely use it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, outsiders could not snatch it away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the name displayed for the white circle on the Returning to Truth Panel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"[Descended to the Mortal Realm]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Stroking the white circle, Li Fan muttered these three words, but in his heart, he was thinking about the correct way to use the white circle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Go!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan threw the white circle towards Mount Dissolution below.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a thought, the white circle grew as it met the wind, instantly enveloping the entire mountaintop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, it fell downwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the white circle landed, the mountain that had been encircled along the way disintegrated and vanished inch by inch in front of Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Turning into spiritual energy, it dissipated in Great Xuan's heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The thousands of feet of Mount Dissolution disappeared into thin air just like that. The innumerable creatures that inhabited the mountain uncontrollably fell from the air because of the mountain's sudden disappearance. If it weren't for the spiritual energy that rose from the white circle disintegrating Mount Dissolution to hold them back, Mount Dissolution would probably have been reduced to hell in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The area could now perhaps be called Dissolution Circle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The earth was like being cut by a knife in one entire piece, smooth as a mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Mount Dissolution creatures who had lost their home frantically fled, driven by instinctive fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before long, the originally vibrant Mount Dissolution had become a forbidden zone for life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan took a long breath and absorbed all the spiritual energy obtained from the disintegration into his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This bit of spiritual energy was not even a drop in the bucket for the current him. Primarily, it was to analyze the spiritual energy of the [Descended to the Mortal Realm], and what the difference was from ordinary heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After careful tasting, Li Fan came to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no difference at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This spiritual energy even gave Li Fan an extremely familiar feeling, as if it was something that Great</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-319" class="calibre1">Chapter 1306: The Changing Realm Between Immortals and Mortals</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Transformation Between the Mortal and Immortal Realms (7K)</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The primary task of this life is to achieve the Dao by merging his soul with the Essence of Heaven and Earth of a Super Xuanhuang Realm. Before achieving this goal, it might be wise to avoid these two individuals.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The 【Soul Sealing and Realm Replacement Technique】 is also mentioned in the Heavenly Physician's 【Mending Heaven Records】."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A realm is like a person. Just as a person can undergo possession, so too can a world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, there are two preconditions for successfully replacing a realm. First, the divine sense serving as the 'Realm Soul' must be incredibly strong. At the very least, it cannot be much weaker than the world's Heavenly Dao's original consciousness. Otherwise, during the brief process of realm replacement, the world itself will undergo an inward collapse. It would be a disaster comparable to the destruction of the world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A transparent figure within the Dharma Transmitting body flashed in Li Fan's mind, and his gaze shifted slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Secondly, the performer must achieve complete suppression of the world. They must cause the world's consciousness to completely fall into slumber. If two consciousnesses exist simultaneously, it is highly likely to cause the world to split…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Heavenly Physician, the Dharma Transmitter, and the five Heavenly Venerates of the Five Elders Council working together can indeed accomplish this."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Combining the contents of the 【Mending Heaven Records】 with the Heavenly Physician's textbook-like practical operation, a flash of insight suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Soul Sealing and Realm Replacement… Now that the Heavenly Dao consciousness of the Great Xuan Small World has just been born, it is an excellent opportunity for me to try my hand."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked up, his eyes piercing through the earth, directly reaching the skies of Great Xuan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As if pierced by a sharp arrow, a seven-colored vortex appeared in the sky. No one in Great Xuan, except for Li Fan, could perceive it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within this seven-colored vortex, the world's consciousness, like an infant, was slumbering.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Fearing that a rough action would disturb it, Li Fan carefully separated a wisp of divine sense, infiltrating and approaching it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he comprehended with all his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, the rising and falling winds and clouds, the ebb and flow of the tides, the falling flowers and blooming flowers within the Great Xuan World, all sorts of worldly phenomena appeared before Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if these changes were happening on himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As his comprehension deepened, in addition to natural phenomena, the joys, sorrows, fears, and terrors, birth, aging, sickness, and death of the Great Xuan beings also began to appear in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He felt the same as the Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This would be a rare opportunity for most cultivators in the world. Immersing themselves in it, calmly comprehending, it would not be difficult to grasp a single move or half a trick of earth-shattering great divine power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan actively withdrew from this process of sudden understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Maintaining a state of semi-consciousness, semi-enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mimicry, Myriad Aspects of Living Beings!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a shift of heart, a semi-transparent figure of Li Fan then appeared within the starry vortex in the skies of Great Xuan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All the comprehension gained from the Great Xuan Heavenly Dao was infused into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The semi-transparent figure gradually changed, as if rejuvenating, from the appearance of a middle-aged man, gradually becoming a newly born infant crying out to be fed!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The infant's style of acting was still as experienced as an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Approaching the Heavenly Dao consciousness of Great Xuan which was soundly sleeping, it lunged forward and covered it…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Replacing it!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Great Xuan Small World instantly fell into violent shaking.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The earth shook, and cracks like scars stretched out from the central starry vortex in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Disintegration Disc! Deduction!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within Li Fan's sea of consciousness, the Terminus Disintegration Disc temporarily suspended its task of deducing the downgrading of immortal arrays, and instead fully calculated the adaptation of the Great Xuan mimicry personality.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After continuous improvement by the 【Mimicry, Myriad Aspects of Living Beings】 great array, the semi-lit, semi-dim, constantly flickering transparent infant finally became stable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Realm Replacement!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, located in the deepest part of the underground, gathered a golden needle in his hand. Then, he shot it towards the sky, the mimicry Great Xuan Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Right in the center of its brow, between its eyebrows.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The semi-transparent infant subconsciously let out a slight cry. With the first cry from the Heavens and Earth, the Great Dao was silent. No one in the world could hear it, but in an instant, it spread throughout the entire Great Xuan Small World.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From weak to strong, it became louder and louder. Finally, it became inaudible.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within this cry of the mimicry Great Xuan personality, worldly anomalies also slowly disappeared, returning to their initial tranquility.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The wounds and vortices in the sky healed, and Li Fan could sense the mimicry personality that had replaced the nascent Heavenly Dao of Great Xuan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Or rather, it would be more appropriate to describe it as a mimicry Heavenly Constitution.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The nascent Heavenly Dao consciousness of Great Xuan was not destroyed by Li Fan, but rather forcibly suppressed and sealed into slumber.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All slow growth of the Heavenly Dao's consciousness would be absorbed and synchronized to the mimicry Heavenly Constitution. This was to ensure the correct operation of Great Xuan's Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was like nutrients to cultivate and strengthen the mimicry Heavenly Constitution. When the mimicry Heavenly Constitution could fully undertake the Heavenly Dao operation of the Great Xuan Small World, it would completely devour the Heavenly Dao consciousness that had been slumbering since its birth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Completing a true transformation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan carefully sensed the operation of the Great Xuan mimicry Heavenly Constitution. The mimicry Heavenly Constitution was his creation, and all the information it received, he could naturally sense as well. The current situation was as if there was a Heavenly Dao clone, helping him comprehend the Dao at all times.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it was only the Heavenly Dao of a small world, it excelled in being continuous, accumulating little by little.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The first time doing it, the methods were a bit rough. If it weren't for the Terminus Disintegration Disc adjusting in time, I'm afraid the Great Xuan World would have been destroyed by my hands." Li Fan looked at the great ravines caused by the anomalies in the world on the surface of Great Xuan, slightly shaking his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, with this experience, the subsequent 【Soul Sealing and Realm Replacement】 of other small worlds will surely go much smoother."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the traditional Realm Replacement Technique in the Heavenly Physician's 【Mending Heaven Records】, Li Fan's improved version used 【Mimicry Heavenly Constitution】.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Originating from 【The Truth and Falsehood of All Things】 and the enlightenment of the Great Xuan Ancient World Protecting Immortal Array 【Nine Star Crimson Pearls】, perhaps only Li Fan in the world could perform this mimicry technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The mimicry Heavenly Constitution did not truly possess its own thinking, but merely operated mechanically, completely obeying its creator. Controlling it was more effortless.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">More importantly, there were thousands of small worlds in the Xuanhuang Realm. If he used the original Soul Sealing and Realm Replacement Technique, just finding the divine souls of cultivators comparable to the Heavenly Dao consciousness of each world would take a lot of effort. But now, Li Fan himself could solve this problem alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if he manipulated a large number of small worlds, there was no need to worry about the risk of losing control.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After these worlds are returned to Xuanhuang, the Heavenly Dao of the small worlds will also merge with the Heavenly Dao of Xuanhuang. Although the size is disproportionate, many ants can still kill an elephant. Coupled with my other methods at that time…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A wonderful and insidious plan instantly arose in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Due to my current limited strength, I can only create mimicry Heavenly Constitutions on the scale of small worlds. When I advance further, in the future, I might be able to create mimicry Xuanhuang, or even mimicry Star Seas…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he gradually tasted the sweetness of enlightenment in 【The Truth and Falsehood of All Things】, Li Fan increasingly felt that this transformation of true and false was even more so his fundamental source of power than the specific methods of cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's a pity, this Dao is too profound. Even after a hundred lifetimes of reincarnation, I have only managed to comprehend a little. Moreover, this 【The Truth and Falsehood of All Things】 Dao is limited to those with 【Returning to Truth】 to comprehend, so it cannot be emulated."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan also faintly sensed that for the comprehension of 【The Truth and Falsehood of All Things】, the so-called talent and comprehension discussed in the ordinary cultivation world were useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To further explore its true mysteries, the most important thing was actually…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Chance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Or rather, in more common terms, it depended on the mood of 【Returning to Truth】.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous life, after Returning to Truth came into contact with the so-called 【New Variable Interference】, Li Fan discovered that his understanding of the changes in 【The Truth and Falsehood of All Things】 had obviously become much easier.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although his own talent and understanding had not changed, it was as if he was closer and more easily touched it. Its mystery reached such depths.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Spreading of the Dao, Projections…" Li Fan also thought of the various statements of the Holy Emperor spreading the Dao and the衍法珏little Lori Dharma Jade, narrowmed</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-320" class="calibre1">Chapter 1307: The Way of the Star Sea Gift</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The true immortals used their script to describe the path of immortality. However, the path of immortality also had distinctions in its ranks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What I saw before, Hungering, Chaos, Solitude, Return, were likely the most basic. That true immortal script which might represent 'Creation' was clearly above them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the 'path' represented by this mark hidden within the bodies of the You clan...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The change between mortal and immortal surpassed even 'Creation'!</p>
<p class="calibre2">And [Returning to Truth]...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even after [Returning to Truth] 125 times, and personally experiencing the grand power of resetting all things in the world with a single thought, he knew that [Returning to Truth] was almost beyond everything he knew.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But in his previous life, the process of [Returning to Truth] was interfered with by an unknown variable. Coupled with the terrifying power displayed by the Cat Treasure, which leaped out of the darkness, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a sliver of doubt about the ultimate limit of [Returning to Truth]. As he gradually came into contact with forces beyond the High Wall in the future, would [Returning to Truth] still be invincible like in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea's central region?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This discovery gave Li Fan a sense of reassurance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The limit of [Returning to Truth] was far more unfathomable than he had imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The laws of the Xuanhuang Realm can be seen as a downward projection of the laws of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea. And the laws of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea are themselves a downward projection of the laws of the Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And [Returning to Truth] stands above everything. Reflecting from top to bottom, theoretically, it can replicate everything I come into contact with through the [False Becomes True] transformation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As long as my strength and comprehension are sufficient."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan recalled the sensation when he was writing that mysterious mark just now, lost in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is merely the [False Becomes True] transformation. [Returning to Truth] is not just [False Becomes True]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There is also the previous [True Becomes False]!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his thoughts raced, Li Fan casually picked up a round stone nearby. Staring intently at the stone, he attempted to directly erase its existence through [True Becomes False].</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, each time he underwent [Returning to Truth], the surrounding world seemed to be shrouded in white mist, making it unclear. Therefore, Li Fan could not know how the process of [True Becomes False] was achieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps during this life's [Returning to Truth], I can try to actively disperse the surrounding mist," Li Fan couldn't help but think.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I can gain enlightenment on this path, with the supreme power of [Returning to Truth], perhaps I can directly bypass a major realm and casually erase opponents..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his thoughts churned, Li Fan sorted through the mysterious symbols he had glimpsed by possessing You clan members over the past year, based on the remaining impressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he handed them over to the Terminus Disintegration Disc for classification and application.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Simultaneously handling two Immortal Array related tasks, the Disintegration Disc's efficiency inevitably decreased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems it's time to upgrade the Disintegration Disc again. Pure sublimation triggered by Immortal Array data is ultimately limited by mortal physique."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The nine initial Disintegration Discs of the Myriad Immortals Alliance are incomparable to the one in my hand. They can provide minuscule help. To completely transform into an Immortal Artifact Disintegration Disc, Immortal Spirit Power is ultimately needed..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pressed his slightly throbbing temples, which were swollen from overwork. After relaxing, he looked at the You clan members present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They did not feel grief over the death of the person Li Fan possessed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, they felt exceptionally uplifted by their sacrifice to the great Dark Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing the You clan members' devout demeanor, Li Fan was deeply moved. With a wave of his hand, he instantly collected them all into his body, temporarily suppressing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After returning to the Great Xuan Small World, he would provide them with the best living conditions, allowing them to remain in Great Xuan and pray peacefully for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Small World cannot be wasted either."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Small World where the You clan resided was even weaker than Great Xuan. Naturally, it had not nurtured a Heavenly Dao consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan found it much easier to proceed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He created a Mimic Heavenly Constitution to directly replace the Heavenly Dao and maintain the normal operation of this Small World.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, using the same method, he silently grafted it onto the Xuanhuang Main Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Practice makes perfect. This time, the Art of Healing Heaven went very smoothly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With another Heavenly Dao clone from a Small World, threads of comprehension, like churning waves, surfaced in his mind from time to time. Even though its status was insufficient, this large influx of enlightenment inspirations could still provide Li Fan with some tangible insights.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Heavenly Dao comprehension is useless to me, but for other cultivators, it's a rare sight even in a lifetime." After returning to Great Xuan and settling the You clan members, and after a majority of them had converted their beliefs, Li Fan looked at the densely seated cultivators on the Great Xuan preaching platform, his heart stirred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Buzz...</p>
<p class="calibre2">A platform emerged in mid-air, beneath the Cultivation Manual Directory Platform and above the disciples.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The platform was carved with scenes of all worlds, all spirits, and all things, yet it was like a living entity, constantly changing, lifelike.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If one looked closely, if they were lucky, they might occasionally spot a seven-colored speck of light within the stone carvings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those were the enlightenments from the Mimic Heavenly Constitution that Li Fan could not use. If the cultivators on the preaching platform were fortunate enough to comprehend them, rapid progress in their cultivation, and even the realization of unique divine abilities, would not be difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The beings on the preaching platform are all under my surveillance. Their inspiration is also my inspiration."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although their realm is low, the sparks of thought, magnified countless times, are still brilliant. Even if only one out of ten thousand provides me with inspiration, with the number of cultivators on this preaching platform, accumulating over time will be a considerable wealth."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, if necessary, I can also mobilize the preaching platform and manipulate the thoughts of the cultivators on it, making them help me comprehend..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Inside the preaching platform, a silver-white orb, like an eye, continuously absorbed the inner inspiration from different beings, gradually becoming somewhat eerie, as if coming alive, and slowly rotating around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sacred Master's projection, after initially completing the preaching mission for Great Xuan, further divided a body and traveled to the next Small World.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This new body was not supported by Li Fan's main body's power. Instead, it was formed by the Sacred Master's projection absorbing the faith power from his disciples during his preaching, and then converging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was similar to the [Great Sun Emperor's Scripture], but instead of Great Qi becoming Great Xuan, and soldiers becoming students, the Sacred Emperor became the Sacred Master.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The initial stage of expansion would be delegated to these projections. When the act of preaching began to alarm the Myriad Immortals Alliance, or other hidden powerful beings in the Small Worlds, Li Fan would personally intervene to suppress and subdue them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before that, Li Fan still needed to prepare thoroughly for the future confrontation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The You clan members whose faith had been altered by the division had already begun to provide Li Fan with initial Origin Force Essence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using this Origin Force Essence as bait, coupled with various threats and inducments, Li Fan, with practiced ease, pulled all his old acquaintances, including Bai, Qiao Gong, and Yin Shangren, into the alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A great change is about to occur in the heavens and earth. You all may not yet comprehend it. I will now discuss it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Great Xuan preaching platform, Li Fan's main body replaced the projection and sat solemnly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Below, Yin Shangren and the others listened to Li Fan's sermon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan spoke of the revival of the Star Sea, and the resulting scenes of Xuanhuang's revival in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The audience listened with a mixture of belief and doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled faintly and pointed to the sky, as if opening a vortex to the outside of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please follow me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seven-colored divine rainbow appeared on his body as Li Fan invited everyone to enter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crowd exchanged glances, but in the end, they all entered Li Fan's protective rainbow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A seven-colored light shot up into the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Passing through the vortex in the celestial curtain, in the next moment, they appeared at the boundary of Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their momentum showed no signs of stopping, as if they intended to continue their rapid journey into the Star Sea of Xuanhuang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The faces of the crowd immediately turned pale.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They all knew about the terrifying suction force outside the Xuanhuang Realm. If they left the protection of the Xuanhuang Realm, they might fall into it at any moment, their lives hanging by a thread.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But what happened next was far beyond their expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The seven-colored rainbow light separated into different colors, drawing a curved arc in the Star Sea. It successfully led everyone away from the Xuanhuang Realm!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crowd was utterly astonished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, however, continued to speed towards the depths of the Star Sea without stopping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The desolation of the Star Sea filled everyone with sorrow, their eyes showing grief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dangers within the Star Sea made everyone's hearts tremble, their expressions growing solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan, like a prophet, was always able to navigate around the dangerous areas of the Star Sea, which made everyone look at him with admiration. They all speculated how many times Li Fan had traveled to the starry sky to be so familiar with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as they ventured deeper into the Star Sea, Li Fan's speed also slowed down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He seemed to be discerning the direction as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren and the others had the right feeling. After all, in the previous life, when the Saint Emperor gained enlightenment from the center of the Star Sea, his connection with his main body had become increasingly faint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, this journey to witness the revival of the Star Sea would be more difficult the further they went, requiring Li Fan to find his own path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, he was following a map.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, relying on his innate senses, had already touched the origin consciousness of this Star Sea. However, in the previous life, the Saint Emperor had attracted the attention of the Star Sea's origin consciousness by using the [Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao] clone and his identity as a potential savior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This life, Li Fan had not yet revealed himself, nor did he possess the qualifications to be noticed by the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan also had no intention of exposing himself to the Star Sea so early.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But this did not hinder Li Fan's subsequent plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This should be the place." Sensing that it was almost time, Li Fan stopped and looked at the void ahead, sighing slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone heard his words and looked in the same direction with complex expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In their perception, this area of the Star Sea was indeed different from before. It seemed brighter and warmer. But it was still far from what Li Fan had described as "revival."</p>
<p class="calibre2">It still appeared completely desolate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, since the other party had gone to such great lengths to bring them here, it was certainly not without reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Could it be that my comprehension is insufficient?</p>
<p class="calibre2">A hint of self-doubt flashed through everyone's minds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterward, they all continued to observe with utmost solemnity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan noticed the subtle changes in everyone's expressions and smiled without a word.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, he finally spoke, "Has everyone gained anything?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">In response, there was only silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan feigned a slight look of surprise, pondered for a moment, and then suddenly waved his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He struck several beams of light into everyone’s sea of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These were precisely the insights of the Saint Emperor regarding the power of the Star Sea's revival from the previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Around them, subtle traces of life began to appear out of thin air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong, Bai Hua, and the others had survived since the destruction of the Immortal Realm. Who among them was not a peerless genius?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Previously, because the Star Sea's consciousness was too vast and hidden beneath decay and desolation, they had not noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, with Li Fan directly implanting the results of his enlightenment into their minds, they naturally sensed something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's true!" Bai Hua was the most deeply moved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I could control this power of revival, perhaps I could bring the Myriad Sheng Realm back..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren stroked his head. The residual souls of worlds that he had devoured seemed to be attracted by this power of revival, wanting to emerge from his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For a time, everyone was immersed in the face of the vast power of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Completely oblivious to the fact that Li Fan, who had guided their enlightenment, had already distanced himself from them for some unknown reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, Li Fan even used a method close to an Immortal Array to temporarily conceal his traces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had a premonition that exposing his existence to the origin consciousness of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea too early would definitely not be a good thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At least until I achieve Dao Integration and reach the pinnacle of the Mortal Realm," Li Fan looked at the enlightened individuals, his eyes flickering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone woke up at different times, immersed in their enlightenment. Qiao Gong was the first to awaken. His eyes darted around, as if he had thought of a brilliant idea and couldn't wait to return to the Xuanhuang Realm to experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Yin Shangren, it seemed he spent a considerable amount of time resolving the residual world souls within his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, to Li Fan's slight surprise, Bai Hua was actually the last to awaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From her gaze, Li Fan could feel the joy in Bai Hua's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Congratulations everyone, you have all gained something."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea is fraught with peril and should not be lingered in for too long. We should return as soon as possible," Li Fan said with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone nodded in agreement, responding with the etiquette of disciples.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The journey was smooth, and everyone returned to the Great Xuan preaching platform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the saying goes, seeing is believing. Having personally experienced the Star Sea, everyone now fully believed Li Fan's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The revival of the Star Sea was imminent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please understand that the desolation of the Star Sea will not be revived overnight."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang, as the only surviving land in the current Star Sea, should become the source of the Star Sea's revival."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Only by radiating life from here can we achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After listening to Li Fan's conclusion and pondering for a moment, everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There is no greater merit than assisting a rising power."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If we can contribute to the Star Sea's revival, and when the Star Sea recovers its former glory in the future, the benefits we will receive need not be said," Li Fan said calmly, looking at everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren and the others were clearly tempted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if the immortal path remains closed, by borrowing its feedback, perhaps we can all advance to become the strongest in the Star Sea," Qiao Gong's eyes flickered with greed.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-321" class="calibre1">Chapter 1308: The First Change in the Xuanhuang Realm</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, how should it be done?" Yin Shangren's gaze was fervent as he pointed out the crux of the matter. Their strengths were actually quite balanced. The old method of achieving longevity, let alone helping the Star Sea recover, was insufficient even to alter the precarious situation of the Xuanhuang Realm. As if doused with a basin of cold water, everyone quickly composed themselves and looked in unison at Li Fan. Li Fan sat solemnly on the Preaching Platform, as if he had anticipated Yin Shangren's question long ago. He answered unhurriedly, "Do you all know that a world is like a person, and the Star Sea is also thus?" "If a person is ill, one prescribes medicine accordingly, and then stimulates acupoints and meridians." "The world and the Star Sea, after suffering calamity, can also be treated similarly..." A human-shaped light projection slowly appeared before everyone as Li Fan spoke. The important acupoints and meridians were all clearly marked. Li Fan made a gentle gesture, and the light projection suddenly transformed. It expanded, diffused, and finally turned into a faintly glowing yellow cloud. The original acupoints and meridians within the human body also followed the laws of evolution and were arranged in various parts of the light mass. Everyone had just returned from the outer void of Xuanhuang. How could they not recognize that this cloud represented the Xuanhuang Realm? As they focused their gazes, Li Fan made another gesture. The light mass expanded again, a thousandfold, ten thousandfold. A splendid scene instantly engulfed everyone, causing them to become lost within it. It was, in fact, a brilliant Star Sea. Everyone vaguely perceived that the spots within the Star Sea that occasionally flickered and emitted a unique radiance were precisely the acupoints and meridians that had previously been within the human body and world! "The transition from man to world, and from world to domain, should be thus!" Yin Shangren mused. The others also seemed to have attained enlightenment. Before they could examine further, Li Fan waved his hand, and the Star Sea instantly reverted, returning to the scene of the Xuanhuang Realm. "To revive the Star Sea first, one must revive Xuanhuang. To revive Xuanhuang, one must foster this place." On the miniature projection of the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan marked various locations. "For thousands of years, the Xuanhuang Realm has been consumed and plundered by cultivators. It should have long been completely depleted. However, fortunately, there was the Heavenly Venerate who transmitted the Dharma and continuously collected fragments of worlds from the Star Sea to nourish it. The remnants of worlds are like medicine; although Xuanhuang has consumed them, it has not yet fully absorbed them..." Those speckled marks, emitting a ruddy, crystalline radiance, seemed to contain infinite vitality and energy. The crowd, however, had already understood Li Fan's meaning within his discourse. Simply put, in one sentence: Help Xuanhuang digest the medicinal properties! Li Fan continued, "The Xuanhuang Realm has been weak for a long time and is in danger of not being able to absorb nourishment. Therefore, it needs to be guided and enticed, using acupoints to lead meridians, and points to encompass surfaces..." The sermon lasted for a full seven days and seven nights. After Li Fan's figure dissipated, everyone remained immersed in the principles of the unity of man, heaven, and medicine that he had expounded, deeply moved. It was Yin Shangren who was the first to regain clarity. "The remnants of worlds are like medicine; this metaphor is truly ingenious. Absorption, digestion, and merging into oneself. And that which cannot be absorbed will be completely discarded. These are what are called medicinal dregs..." Qiao Gong, distracted, offered a few perfunctory words and then excused himself. Bai Hua, however, frowned slightly, "Guiding Xuanhuang to digest the remnants of worlds is also not an easy task. The cultivators of Xuanhuang have been in opposition with the Heavenly Dao for so many years, and any action involving the power of the remnants of worlds could provoke the hostility of Xuanhuang's Heavenly Dao. Even if we are doing it for its own good." "That is why we must first resolve this misunderstanding and gain the trust of Xuanhuang's Heavenly Dao," Yin Shangren said, looking towards where Li Fan's figure had vanished. When he departed, Li Fan had said that before he lectured again, he would help resolve this matter. It was just that no one knew what method he would employ. As a soul from the remnants of worlds, Yin Shangren knew better than anyone how difficult it was to resolve the hostility of the Xuanhuang Realm. Seven days later, when Li Fan reappeared, he invited everyone to the sky above the Great Xuan Small World. Arriving here, Yin Shangren felt as if he had fallen into a swamp. Every movement he made faced immense resistance. His essence as a soul from the remnants of worlds offered no help in dissolving this hindering force. He couldn't even discern the source of this inexplicable resistance. Bai Hua and Qiao Gong also wore expressions of extreme solemnity, indicating that they too had sensed the extraordinariness of this place. "Everyone, allow me to introduce someone." Li Fan said with a smile. Then, a hunched old man with white hair appeared before everyone. The white-haired old man's strength was not particularly impressive, but the coffin on his back attracted everyone's attention. The churning resentment emanating faintly from the coffin caused Yin Shangren and the others to narrow their eyes. "This is fellow Daoist Xu Ke, a former disciple of the Beast Taming Sect. Due to a mission, he has been in hiding in this small world, meditating for thousands of years..." After briefly introducing Xu Ke's origin to everyone, Li Fan gestured with his eyes, and Xu Ke took down the coffin from his back. It was suspended in mid-air. As if sensing the watcher's temporary departure, the sealed object within the coffin instantly became more agitated. The coffin lid vibrated incessantly, as if the being imprisoned within would break free at any moment. "Do you all know what is sealed within this coffin?" Li Fan asked. Without waiting for everyone's response, he directly revealed the answer: "It is a strand of Xuanhuang's will." "However, this will has now been filled with negative emotions such as resentment, madness, and paranoia. It has already transformed into an undeniable evil thought of Xuanhuang!" "Today, we are going to purify this evil thought and return it to Xuanhuang!" Li Fan said solemnly. Xu Ke coughed lightly and added, "This evil thought intended to completely sever ties with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao when it was separated back then. For the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, it is not merely like cutting off a piece of flesh. It is a being akin to a clone." "If we can return it and restore the previously missing part, it will definitely attract the favor of Xuanhuang..." "Of course, the prerequisite is that we can truly purify the evil thoughts within it." Xu Ke looked at Li Fan. Li Fan, on the other hand, was full of confidence. "It's merely an evil thought. With everyone working together, is there anything that cannot be purified?" Qiao Gong, having listened for a long time, became somewhat impatient after learning the true identity of the sealed object in the coffin. "How exactly should we proceed? I will definitely cooperate fully!" "What it hates is merely not leaving back then. Since that is the case, let's fulfill its wish and let it cross the High Wall back then!" As Li Fan spoke, a whisk suddenly appeared in his hand. He raised it high, then swept it down towards the coffin with force. The countless white strands of the whisk, like ten thousand meteors, plunged into the coffin. The coffin, which had been violently shaking, leaped up and then froze in mid-air. The white strands of the whisk emitted a dreamlike silver light. Within the silver light, countless different scenes flashed. They were all dream images injected by Li Fan. Although the dreams were different from each other, they all depicted the great terror and great destruction beyond the High Wall. The Xuanhuang evil thought, attached to Mr. Bai, successfully crossed the High Wall and escaped the Utmost Darkness Star Sea. Each time, it failed to survive for more than three breaths before dying from various unspeakable and unknown disasters. In the blink of an eye, the Xuanhuang evil thought had experienced tens of thousands of deaths in the illusions. Observing this, Qiao Gong muttered to himself, "Isn't this a bit too outrageous? Although the outside of the High Wall is unknown, it shouldn't be like this, right? Even an ordinary-looking cat can swallow it in one bite? This Xuanhuang evil thought, in terms of strength alone, is probably not much weaker than the cultivators of the ancient law. Can it really be tricked into going?" Xu Ke, who had been with the Xuanhuang evil thought for thousands of years, keenly noticed that the struggle within the coffin had indeed weakened, and he could not help but show joy. "It really works!" At this moment, Li Fan's voice also came from above, "Everyone can also help to depict dreams, no matter how bizarre or terrifying they are. As long as the Xuanhuang evil thought ultimately perishes, it will be fine." The whisk's light intensified, expanding to everyone's presence. At the end of the handle, a vortex faintly appeared. Yin Shangren and the others understood implicitly, and each poured their most terrifying imagined dream into it with their intents. Among these, Yin Shangren's depicted dream was the most bizarre and terrifying. Even with Li Fan's current experience, after observing it, he could not help but feel a shiver. Compared to it, the illusions woven by Qiao Gong, Bai Hua, and Xu Ke were much more common. Qiao Gong's dream mostly involved the destruction of worlds, becoming a puppet, and the difficulty of distinguishing between reality and illusion. Bai Hua's dream was related to the withering of life and the freezing stillness of all things. Under the continuous baptism of different terrifying dreams, the Xuanhuang evil thought had already undergone a qualitative change. "Is it really so terrifying outside the High Wall?" "If I had known, I shouldn't have left the High Wall in the first place. Even if I could only survive, it would be better than dying instantly!" Thoughts like these accumulated within the Xuanhuang evil thought with each ended dream. Although each was like a barely noticeable scratch, the speed of dream generation and iteration was too fast. In every moment, hundreds of thousands of dreams disappeared and reappeared. More importantly, these dreams were not just ordinary dreams. They were infused with a trace of Li Fan's understanding of [False Becomes True], making them top-tier illusory formations in the world. From the outside, one might wonder why people within the formation could not distinguish between dreams and reality. But only by being truly within the formation could one personally feel the power of the [False Becomes True] illusion. Li Fan looked at his masterpiece with an kwietnia sense of pride in his heart. "It is derived from [Cloud Water Illusory Dream Technique], but its effect is far superior to the original version." "Coupled with the amplification of the illusory formation... even if it's not an Immortal Array, it's better than an Immortal Array." As the dreams continuously iterated, the Xuanhuang evil thought sank faster and faster. Initially, it would occasionally express doubt and resistance. Later, all its doubts disappeared. All that remained was endless regret and fear. Looking at the trembling Xuanhuang evil thought in the formation, Li Fan knew that this dish was finally ready to be served. "Rise!" Li Fan extended his hand forward, grasping the giant whisk in mid-air. Then, he stirred it slightly. The myriad silver-white strands of the whisk also stirred within the coffin, like sharp blades, incessantly slicing the Xuanhuang evil thought, which had completely given up resistance, into countless small pieces. The sealed coffin also began to become ethereal as the evil thought disintegrated. Li Fan gently waved the whisk, and a portion of the silk threads, carrying a part of the dismembered Xuanhuang evil thought, floated towards Yin Shangren's presence. "Fellow Daoist, please!" Yin Shangren first bowed, expressing his gratitude to Li Fan. Then, he solemnly accepted the divided Xuanhuang evil thought before him. Li Fan then distributed a portion to Qiao Gong. Like slicing a cucumber, in a short while, Li Fan had completed the division of the Xuanhuang evil thought. Everyone present had a share. Li Fan himself also had a share, even more than others. However, Yin Shangren and the others naturally had no objections. "Go!" Manipulating the giant whisk, Li Fan's expression was solemn as he tossed it towards the sky. It tore through the firmament, opening a passage to the Xuanhuang Realm. "Vast and boundless, let the soul return~" Li Fan chanted softly. And without Li Fan needing to do much more, the moment the passage was opened, the consciousness of the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao had already noticed the existence of the Great Xuan and its own will that had been separated in the past. Within the passage, a great booming sound continuously echoed, as if the consciousness of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was about to descend. "Let the soul return!" Li Fan pointed to the void. The purified and divided strand of Xuanhuang evil thought before him flew towards the passage. Its speed rapidly increased, and in a flash, it disappeared from everyone's sight. Next, Yin Shangren and the others followed suit. After about half a day, the Xuanhuang evil thought, which had been scattered for many years, finally fully returned to the Xuanhuang Realm. The passage closed, and all strange phenomena vanished. Xu Ke looked at the completely ethereal and disappeared sealed coffin, a sense of loss filling his heart. Qiao Gong, however, frowned slightly. "Is that it? Will this be in vain?" Li Fan smiled faintly. "Everyone, rest assured. Xuanhuang will not forget those who have contributed." "However, it will take time for Xuanhuang to digest. Before receiving the rewards, everyone only needs to wait patiently." Li Fan's figure faded away with these words, leaving behind a group of people with various expressions. Yin Shangren looked at Xu Ke and inquired about Mr. Bai. Xu Ke, who had been somewhat bewildered, immediately became spirited. The two of them, hitting it off, began to reminisce. Bai Hua and Qiao Gong, on the other hand, were somewhat at odds with each other and went about their own business. They were all waiting for the rewards from the Xuanhuang Realm that Li Fan had spoken of. Meanwhile, within the Xuanhuang Realm. Li Fan's true body, in hiding, quietly observed the changes in the Xuanhuang Realm. If the absorption of Immortal Spiritual Energy caused changes in the mountains, rivers, and surface of the Xuanhuang Realm, then after absorbing its lost will, the changes in the Xuanhuang Realm occurred silently within the world itself. Only cultivators who were very familiar with the operation of the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao could perceive it. "To compare with us cultivators, it's like the strengthening of the soul and divine sense." "The first to benefit will be the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm, that is, the longevity of Xuanhuang..." Li Fan sensed several vast consciousnesses sweeping across the world. Some of them were quite familiar. "Hmph, I'll let you taste a bit of sweetness first. In the end, you'll have to spit it all out!" The vast consciousnesses searched several times but could not find the reason for the inexplicable changes in the Xuanhuang Realm. They could only give up. Li Fan sneered inwardly and paid them no mind, continuing to carefully sense the changes in the Xuanhuang Realm. Unlike the changes of world destruction that he had comprehended, these were subtle transformations.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-322" class="calibre1">Chapter 1309: First Encounter in the Land of Harmony</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The cataclysmic changes that befell the Xuanhuang Realm were the extreme transformations it underwent naturally to protect itself upon sensing its impending doom. These were all evolutions where certain aspects were pushed to their absolute limits.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For example, the "Heaven and Earth Turning to Ice, All Things Frozen into Stillness" variation that Li Fan used in his previous life to masquerade as a cultivator who had merged with the Dao. It was no weaker than the ordinary elemental spirits of ice found in the Xuanhuang Realm, and in fact, was stronger than most of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The World-Ending Changes were often filled with destructive and offensive power. Because they typically only manifested when the Xuanhuang Realm faced imminent destruction, their appearance in the world inevitably provoked a reactive response from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. The consequence was that the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao would instinctively become wary and distrustful of those who possessed these World-Ending Changes, just as Li Fan was experiencing now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In contrast, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, after absorbing its own severed malevolent thoughts, underwent changes akin to being infused with immortal energy, a full-scale resurgence. However, the changes were specifically reflected in the foundational laws of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The anomalous longevity changes were set aside for the moment. The various restrictions the Xuanhuang Realm imposed on cultivators also became more stringent with the internal resurgence of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The bottleneck of the Heavenly Tribulation, the inability to cultivate multiple laws simultaneously, and the strange phenomena that appeared in the sky after a cultivator's demise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These laws, intimately connected to a cultivator's progress, were undergoing silent and rapid transformation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Cultivators would find it even harder to break through; the phenomena in the sky after death would record more information about the cultivator's life; the judgment standards for different laws would become stricter, and the total number of cultivation techniques in the world would inexplicably decrease.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, Li Fan vaguely sensed that the efficiency with which the Xuanhuang Realm absorbed and converted the Dao foundations returned by cultivators after their deaths, as well as the fragments of worlds, was slowly increasing with its internal strengthening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A faint grinding sound, like digestion, could be heard throughout the heavens and earth, imperceptible to ordinary cultivators.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Xuanhuang Realm, cultivators practiced by devouring heaven and earth. As the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao's power suddenly expanded, it was bound to drive the rapid advancement of cultivators within it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Foundation Establishment battling Golden Core, Golden Core defeating Nascent Soul. In the near future, this might become commonplace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For those cultivators who had already advanced, to escape this predicament, they would either have to dissipate their cultivation and start anew, or find a way to break through to the next major realm as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise, these cultivators who did not “grow” with the Xuanhuang Realm would soon become obsolete.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Witnessing all the earth-shattering changes within the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan merely observed and did not interfere to extract any benefits. Although the growth of the Xuanhuang Realm had not yet reached Li Fan’s requirements, it was enough to provide him with inspiration.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is a transformation of the Dao. Those who align with the Dao shall live; those who lose the Dao shall perish. It is thus for the Xuanhuang Realm, for the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, and perhaps it was thus for the Immortal Realm in ancient times," Li Fan mused inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He recalled Sun Erlang's experience in the Illusionary Realm of the True Fruit in his previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I wonder what rewards they will gain this time when they journey to the Land of Ultimate Bliss?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Formation Platform, the silver-white eye rotated slightly, and the images of Sun Erlang and his two companions suddenly appeared within it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they were only at the pinnacle of Golden Core cultivation, they were fortunate to have been taught the Great Dao by the Sacred Master. Whether it was the Myriad Immortals Alliance or the Five Elders Association's defensive formations, they were like laid bare to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They advanced unimpeded, traversing the Human Dao Heavenly Realm, and finally reached the so-called Land of Ultimate Bliss.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At first glance, it seemed no different from other regions of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yue Zhenwei, the eldest among the three, surveyed their surroundings, a hint of confusion in his eyes: "Are there fewer people here than in other parts of the Five Elders Association?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang nodded: "Indeed. And they all seem listless. However they look, they have nothing to do with the word 'Bliss'."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba, however, said nonchalantly: "Who cares? Isn't our purpose here to search for Dongtian Worlds needed to break through to the Nascent Soul stage? Naturally, the fewer people, the better!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun and Yue felt his reasoning made sense. Everyone should do what is within their capacity. The secrets of the Land of Ultimate Bliss were naturally not something that mere Golden Core cultivators like them could uncover.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, they continued to conceal their tracks, employing the secret techniques taught by the Sacred Master, searching for traces of Dongtian Worlds within the Land of Ultimate Bliss.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten days passed, and they found nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The expressions of the three began to turn grim.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is impossible. We've practically scoured this Qiuxi Prefecture, and we haven't found a single Dongtian World?" Wang Xuanba exclaimed incredulously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Either the Sacred Master's secret technique is flawed, or..." Yue Zhenwei's complexion was also grim.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang continued: "It is likely that there are no Dongtian Worlds in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Or perhaps, what we are seeing now is not the true Land of Ultimate Bliss, but merely an empty shell. The legendary Dream Realm is its true location."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What should we do next?" Wang Xuanba scratched his head. "We can't just enter the Dream Realm and steal things, right? Why don't we go back to the Human Dao Heavenly Realm and take a look? Although it's more heavily guarded there, its territory is also larger. As long as we are careful, borrowing a few Dongtian Worlds should not be a problem."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun and Yue both nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The three quickly reached a consensus and intended to withdraw from the Land of Ultimate Bliss.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But what filled them with inexplicable horror was that they were returning along the same path they had come, yet upon reaching the boundary of the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the scenery they saw had changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The white mist barrier that spanned heaven and earth, serving as the natural dividing line between prefectures, had vanished. Before them lay an endless, boundless desert that stretched as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The three stood at the edge of the desert, scooping up some yellow sand from the ground and rubbing it between their fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's real," Sun Erlang clenched his fists and said in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba still refused to believe it. He took a step forward and sank into the quicksand: "How could this be? It was fine when we came, but suddenly we can't go back? We didn't even get lost!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I fear we have unknowingly entered the true Dream Realm of the Land of Ultimate Bliss," Yue Zhenwei, the most composed among the three, stated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He gazed into the distance at the desert, not detecting any signs of life within it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's best not to venture into this desert. Let's try another direction."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The three traversed Qiuxi Prefecture once more. On another of its borders, they again encountered a completely different scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Rushing water thundered down from the heavens. The moment it landed in Qiuxi, it transformed into light and shadows, dissipating into nothingness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not far away, there was indeed a water world suspended in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only were there many creatures swimming within it, but one could even faintly discern various underwater structures.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why don't we try this place? We can't leave anyway," Wang Xuanba suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's observe further," Yue Zhenwei carefully examined the surroundings. He noticed that although there were living beings in this water world, the civilization that built the underwater structures was composed of squirming octopuses.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They seemed to possess their own language and writing, ruling this underwater world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But regarding the three of them, Sun Erlang, who were observing from mere inches away, they seemed utterly oblivious, as if existing in different worlds.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Temporarily leaving the water world, the three continued to search along the border of Qiuxi Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, in the southwest corner, they discovered a third bordering prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the prefecture not far away, a large rock stood by the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was exactly the same as the giant rock by the sea in the Shi Lin Prefecture they had seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Excellent! We've finally found an exit!" Wang Xuanba exclaimed with excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as he was about to rush forward, Sun Erlang stopped him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Be careful! Something feels wrong!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Sun Erlang spoke, two figures appeared one after another above the giant rock by the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The first figure was in a sorry state, appearing heavily injured.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The second figure, while clearly faster than the first, seemed to be enjoying the thrill of the hunt, maintaining a specific distance between them. This gave the fleeing figure the illusion that they could escape with a little more effort, but in reality, they could never break free.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If it were a normal pursuit, the three wouldn't have been so surprised. However, the one pursuing the human cultivator who was fleeing in panic was actually a demon with a human body and a dog's head!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the human cultivator was about to escape the Shi Lin Prefecture and enter the Congyun Sea, the dog-headed demon finally grew impatient and ended its hunting game.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Its hand transformed back into a dog's paw, firmly grasping the human cultivator. Witnessing the human cultivator's screams of despair and agony, the dog-headed demon laughed heartily.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, seemingly satisfied, it opened its mouth, ready to devour the human cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Vile beast! Stop!" In their youthful and passionate prime, how could Wang Xuanba bear to witness such a macabre scene of man-eating before his very eyes?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun and Yue couldn't stop him in time. A giant gray-white axe, exuding an ancient aura, broke through the boundaries of the two different territories and appeared before the dog-headed demon.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the dog-headed demon seemed to have been expecting this.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A sinister and excited glint appeared in its eyes. It casually tossed aside the human cultivator it had in hand, its prey now, and even disregarded the giant gray-white axe that was about to strike its head, charging directly at the three of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the dog-headed demon moved, its location, the Xuanhuang Shi Lin Prefecture, simultaneously underwent a mutation. It instantly devoured the territory of Qiuxi Prefecture, engulfing the three of them, Sun Erlang, in its embrace!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As if a dream had manifested into reality, the world of the dog-headed demon and the world of Sun Erlang's trio merged!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">*Clang!*</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba's giant gray-white axe struck the dog-headed demon's nape, but only produced a clang of metal on metal! A full-powered blow, capable of splitting mountains, couldn't even break the dog-headed demon's skin!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba let out a cold snort, but remained fearless: "Did you think grandpa's axe was just sharp?! Relying on your physically strong body to endure the hit? A beast is a beast!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The dog-headed demon seemed to understand Wang Xuanba's words, and its expression shifted slightly. Only then did it notice a glaring gray scar extending from its nape upwards, rapidly engulfing the demon's dog-like head.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Moments later, the gray-white head crumbled into dust and scattered into the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Be careful!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yue Zhenwei and Sun Erlang's voices rang out simultaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Wang Xuanba reveled in his triumph, the dog-headed demon, having lost its head, surprisingly moved again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Its body flickered, and it appeared before Wang Xuanba.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Its dog-like paw transformed into a black streak of light, instantly piercing Wang Xuanba's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanba!" Sun Erlang's eyes blazed with fury.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A blade filled with malevolent energy arrived belatedly, stirring up boundless black winds that directly engulfed the dog-headed demon.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, in just a moment, the dog-headed demon's flesh and blood were completely scraped away by the black winds, leaving only a ghastly white skeleton.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But this skeleton exuded an extraordinary golden radiance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Something's wrong..." Yue Zhenwei's expression shifted subtly, yet he remained unaware. A figure silently approached him from behind. It was none other than the human cultivator the dog-headed demon had been pursuing earlier!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A mocking smile played on his lips. He looked at Yue Zhenwei with greedy eyes. His aura erupted, completely contradicting his previous injured appearance. His neck elongated, and his head flew out, directly swallowing Yue Zhenwei's head into its belly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Alas, Yue Zhenwei's attention was fully focused on the dog-headed demon and Sun Erlang. Caught off guard by the sneak attack, he perished instantly!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ahhh! You deserve to die!" With two companions fallen, Sun Erlang's eyes turned bloodshot.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Veins bulged on his body, and a black energy enveloped him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His pupils were completely consumed by blackness. Disregarding everything, Sun Erlang flew directly towards the long-necked demon.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he was tightly held back by the golden skeleton from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden skeleton cackled, "This trick is so effective, always luring a few fools into the trap."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang's rage intensified.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Aaaargh!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A roar echoed through the heavens and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A black storm suddenly erupted from his Dantian.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was several times more terrifying than the black blade wind from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It directly swallowed the golden skeleton that had been cackling.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Damn it! What is this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before he could finish speaking, the golden skeleton, along with Sun Erlang, disappeared into the black storm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The long-necked demon, however, made no move to rescue him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It watched with relish, all the while chewing on Yue Zhenwei's corpse.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, the black storm completely dissipated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And the corpses of Yue Zhenwei and Wang Xuanba had both become the long-necked demon's meal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang's group suddenly awoke from their nightmare, cold sweat dripping from their foreheads. After a moment, they finally regained their senses from the terrifying experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I died?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I didn't die?!" Wang Xuanba exclaimed, still in shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang fell into deep thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yue Zhenwei, being the most composed, surveyed their surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems we are still in the Five Elders Association's Qiuxi Prefecture, where we were previously trapped."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However..." Yue Zhenwei looked up at the sky. "The entire world seems to have become dimmer?" he stated uncertainly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not an illusion. Our world has indeed become as if night has fallen," Sun Erlang observed for a while and agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But our cultivation realms haven't changed... Wait, what is this?!" Sun Erlang's voice suddenly rose several octaves.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sun Erlang, Golden Core Completion, Deaths: 1."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Land of Ultimate Bliss Experience Level: 1."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Bliss Coins: 100."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang read out the lines of text that had inexplicably appeared before him, his expression deeply shaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have it too," Wang Xuanba called out, having discovered something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait, that's not right! Why are my Bliss Coins zero?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Where did your hundred come from?" Wang Xuanba asked, utterly bewildered.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-323" class="calibre1">Chapter 1310: Demonic Beasts Secretly Swallow Spirits</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Before dying, I took that bastard with me. These 100 Worry Coins should be the reward for killing him." Sun Erlang was not foolish; with a brief recollection, he deduced the origin of the Worry Coins on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That said, what exactly did we just experience?" Wang Xuanba shivered, instinctively touching his chest as if the pierced wound still existed. "Was it a dream? But the feeling of dying was too real," Wang Xuanba muttered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun Erlang stared at the lines of text before his eyes, attempting to find more useful information. But alas, apart from the text itself, there was no other explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems we have to figure it out ourselves," Sun Erlang's expression was grim.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point, Yue Zhenwei suggested, "Why don't we go back to the border where we encountered the dog-headed beast and see the situation?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The strength of those two beasts is actually similar to ours. As long as we are vigilant and don't get ambushed, we should be fine."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alright! I also want to get revenge on them! I died too miserably just now!" Wang Xuanba's eyes glinted with ferocity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The three once again set off towards the border of Qiuxi Prefecture. On the way, Sun Erlang discovered that the cultivators they encountered seemed to be more numerous than before. Moreover, they were no longer listless; instead, they gathered in groups of three to five, as if discussing something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wanting to get closer and eavesdrop, Sun Erlang and the other two found that these people did not communicate using sound or divine sense, but through a communication method they could not observe.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps we can ask them for information," Wang Xuanba looked at the five cultivators gathering not far away, who seemed to be only at the Middle Innate Stage, his eyes flickering.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yue Zhenwei stopped him, "Xuanba, don't be rash! If my guess is correct, these people should be like us, able to resurrect. Those who don't fear death, trying to get anything out of them with brute force won't work..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's go to our target location first!" Sun Erlang also grunted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba nodded, then shifted his gaze. In this life, both Sun and Wang were young and skilled, having learned their craft on the Dao Revelation Platform. They were already arrogant and impetuous. After leaving Great Xuan, the formations they encountered were all easily broken. Thus, their pride grew even more. It was only after being tricked and ambushed by the beasts that they became somewhat restrained.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Arriving at the location where they had previously "perished," the scene they saw surprised the three: "Why is the world on the other side different from the last time we saw it?" The giant rock scene by the sea in Stone Forest Prefecture had disappeared, replaced by a sword forest filled with murderous intent. Ten thousand decaying swords were thrust into the ground, swaying with the breeze.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">*Buzz...* Perhaps due to being too close, at the moment the swords in the sword forest trembled in unison, Sun Erlang seemed to hear a coordinated sword cry. Sun Erlang's heart trembled, and he instinctively dodled his head. An invisible sword qi, slicing past his cheek, grazed off a piece of skin. Ignoring the pain on his face, Sun Erlang retreated rapidly. Only when the sense of crisis faded did he stop. Undoubtedly, if he hadn't dodged just now, more than just a bit of flesh would have been taken.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This world seems more dangerous than the three we encountered last time?" Yue Zhenwei frowned and speculated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, the three roughly scouted all the worlds bordering Qiuxi Prefecture. A sword forest, a deep valley. And another place that seemed to be the location of a demonic sect. Within it gathered no less than a thousand malevolent cultivators. Looking from afar, one could see these demonic cultivators devouring humans, tormenting people for pleasure, and refining artifacts with human bones. The hellish scene made Wang Xuanba's blood boil, wishing he could rush over immediately and sweep away all the demonic sects. However, Wang Xuanba was impulsive, not stupid. He ultimately did not act rashly, only spitting fiercely at the opposite side.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The three gathered again to discuss: "Should we first inquire about the local customs from the native cultivators here, or venture into another world?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The cultivators of the Land of Worry-Free Land clearly know some rules that we are unaware of. If we ask rashly, we might expose our identities with the first word." "It's possible life is not in danger, but we might be kept here forever."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's try soul extraction? Saint Master has taught us about this. Although we haven't formally used it on cultivators, I think we can give it a try," Wang Xuanba was eager to try.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't forget, we are likely in a dream right now. Soul extraction might not work."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a period of silence, the three decided to try.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Find a lone cultivator, one with weaker strength." "First, knock him unconscious."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The three searched Qiuxi Prefecture for more than half a day before finally finding a suitable target. This person appeared to be only at the Early Innate Stage and seemed to have been separated from his teammates for some unknown reason, anxiously searching.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Attack!" With a thunderous roar, the three killed their final attacks simultaneously on the Innate cultivator. Black whirlwind, gray giant axe, and Yue Zhenwei's purple-qi long sword. However, what caused the three to be utterly dumbfounded was that their combined full-power strike, capable of heavily wounding a Nascent Soul cultivator, actually caused no damage to this Innate cultivator!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Innate cultivator's figure flickered, and all attacks missed. He looked at the three of Sun Erlang with disbelief, unconsciously taking a step back. At the same time, Sun Erlang noticed that the lines of text that had always been displayed before him flickered. There were no other changes. Only the number of Worry Coins turned to zero. Sun Erlang's face twitched. Wang Xuanba also instantly transmitted, wailing, "Why can't Worry Coins be negative? 100 were deducted!" Yue Zhenwei's expression was also very grim, "Mine too." During the brief moment they were communicating, a white light suddenly emerged from the attacked Innate cultivator. The white light swallowed him, and finally, with a look as if they were idiots, the Innate cultivator vanished on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"..." The three from Great Xuan looked at each other in silence, facing each other. "It seems this is also a natural restriction within the Land of Bliss. We are of the same kind as these cultivators. And those monsters we encountered before, including those in the border worlds, are perhaps another kind. Cultivators cannot attack each other, and will even be punished. But killing monsters in the border worlds will have rewards, including Worry Coins..." After a brief period of dejection, Sun Erlang quickly regained his spirits. Based on their experiences, he made recollections and summaries.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We cannot determine the consequences of having too many deducted Worry Coins, but we had best not try. Let's go to the border worlds first and earn back the negative Worry Coins."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point, the three had given up the idea of soul extraction. They couldn't even get close, so how could they extract souls!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With their stomachs full of frustration, after deliberation, and guided by their instincts, they finally chose the demonic sect world, which seemed the most dangerous among the three border worlds.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although that hellish place seems to have many enemies, how powerful can cultivators who refine artifacts with ordinary human bones really be?" "Their spells are also crude. They might scare ordinary people, but they can't withstand my axe!" Wang Xuanba declared confidently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, we still need to be careful. After all, we've died once. I have a hunch that the number of deaths might be even more important than Worry Coins," Yue Zhenwei said, looking at the constantly flickering characters before him with a solemn expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After the three decided on their plan, they moved back-to-back and charged into the demonic sect world. Inside the demonic sect world, ten thousand demonic cultivators were stunned by the arrival of this trio from the sky. After a moment of愣, they shouted in languages incomprehensible to Sun Erlang and swarmed them. Blood mist filled the air, and countless resentful souls wailed. It looked terrifying.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Die, you bastard!" Suddenly, a gray giant axe, exuding an ancient aura, broke through the boundaries of the two different territories and appeared before the dog-headed demon. However, the dog-headed demon seemed to have expected this. A sinister and excited glint appeared in its eyes. It casually tossed aside the human cultivator it had in hand, its prey now, and even disregarded the giant gray-white axe that was about to strike its head, charging directly at the three of them. As the dog-headed demon moved, its location, the Xuanhuang Stone Forest Prefecture, simultaneously underwent a mutation. It instantly devoured the territory of Qiuxi Prefecture, engulfing the three of them, Sun Erlang, in its embrace! As if a dream had manifested into reality, the world of the dog-headed demon and the world of Sun Erlang's trio merged!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">*Clang!* Wang Xuanba's giant gray-white axe struck the dog-headed demon's nape, but only produced a clang of metal on metal! A full-powered blow, capable of splitting mountains, couldn't even break the dog-headed demon's skin!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wang Xuanba let out a cold snort, but remained fearless: "Did you think grandpa's axe was just sharp?! Relying on your physically strong body to endure the hit? A beast is a beast!" The dog-headed demon seemed to understand Wang Xuanba's words, and its expression shifted slightly. Only then did it notice a glaring gray scar extending from its nape upwards, rapidly engulfing the demon's dog-like head. Moments later, the gray-white head crumbled into dust and scattered into the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Be careful!" Yue Zhenwei and Sun Erlang's voices rang out simultaneously. As Wang Xuanba reveled in his triumph, the dog-headed demon, having lost its head, surprisingly moved again. Its body flickered, and it appeared before Wang Xuanba. Its dog-like paw transformed into a black streak of light, instantly piercing Wang Xuanba's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanba!" Sun Erlang's eyes blazed with fury. A blade filled with malevolent energy arrived belatedly, stirring up boundless black winds that directly engulfed the dog-headed demon. However, in just a moment, the dog-headed demon's flesh and blood were completely scraped away by the black winds, leaving only a ghastly white skeleton. But this skeleton exuded an extraordinary golden radiance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Something's wrong..." Yue Zhenwei's expression shifted subtly, yet he remained unaware. A figure silently approached him from behind. It was none other than the human cultivator the dog-headed demon had been pursuing earlier! A mocking smile played on his lips. He looked at Yue Zhenwei with greedy eyes. His aura erupted, completely contradicting his previous injured appearance. His neck elongated, and his head flew out, directly swallowing Yue Zhenwei's head into its belly. Alas, Yue Zhenwei's attention was fully focused on the dog-headed demon and Sun Erlang. Caught off guard by the sneak attack, he perished instantly!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ahhh! You deserve to die!" With two companions fallen, Sun Erlang's eyes turned bloodshot. Veins bulged on his body, and a black energy enveloped him. His pupils were completely consumed by blackness. Disregarding everything, Sun Erlang flew directly towards the long-necked demon. However, he was tightly held back by the golden skeleton from behind. The golden skeleton cackled, "This trick is so effective, always luring a few fools into the trap." Sun Erlang's rage intensified.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Aaaargh!" A roar echoed through the heavens and earth. A black storm suddenly erupted from his Dantian. It was several times more terrifying than the black blade wind from before. It directly swallowed the golden skeleton that had been cackling. "Damn it! What is this..." Before he could finish speaking, the golden skeleton, along with Sun Erlang, disappeared into the black storm. The long-necked demon, however, made no move to rescue him. It watched with relish, all the while chewing on Yue Zhenwei's corpse. Not long after, the black storm completely dissipated. And the corpses of Yue Zhenwei and Wang Xuanba had both become the long-necked demon's meal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ah!" Sun Erlang's group suddenly awoke from their nightmare, cold sweat dripping from their foreheads. After a moment, they finally regained their senses from the terrifying experience. "I died?" "I didn't die?!" Wang Xuanba exclaimed, still in shock. Sun Erlang fell into deep thought. Yue Zhenwei, being the most composed, surveyed their surroundings. "It seems we are still in the Five Elders Association's Qiuxi Prefecture, where we were previously trapped." "However..." Yue Zhenwei looked up at the sky. "The entire world seems to have become dimmer?" he stated uncertainly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not an illusion. Our world has indeed become as if night has fallen," Sun Erlang observed for a while and agreed. "But our cultivation realms haven't changed... Wait, what is this?!" Sun Erlang's voice suddenly rose several octaves. "Sun Erlang, Golden Core Completion, Deaths: 1." "Land of Ultimate Bliss Experience Level: 1." "Worry Coins: 100." Sun Erlang read out the lines of text that had inexplicably appeared before him, his expression deeply shaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have it too," Wang Xuanba called out, having discovered something. "Wait, that's not right! Why are my Bliss Coins zero?" "Where did your hundred come from?" Wang Xuanba asked, utterly bewildered.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-324" class="calibre1">Chapter 1311 (Continued)</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Realm's laws can be seen as a downward projection of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea's laws, and the Utmost Darkness Star Sea's laws are also a downward projection of the Immortal Realm's laws."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And 'Return to Reality'... is almost above all things. Reflecting from top to bottom, theoretically, it can replicate anything I come into contact with through the 'True Becomes False' transformation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As long as my power and understanding are sufficient."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan recalled the feeling of writing that mysterious trace, thoughtfully saying,</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is only the 'True Becomes False' transformation. 'Return to Reality' is not just 'True Becomes False'."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There is also the previous transformation of 'False Becomes True'!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his thoughts moved, Li Fan casually picked up a nearby round stone. Staring intently at the stone, he attempted to erase its existence directly through 'False Becomes True'.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, each time the Return to Reality process occurred, the surrounding real world seemed to be shrouded in white mist, making it impossible to see clearly. Thus, Li Fan could not know how the 'False Becomes True' process was actually realized.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps this time when I return to reality, I can try to actively dissipate the surrounding mist." Li Fan couldn't help but have this thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I can gain insights into this path, with the supreme authority of 'Return to Reality', I might be able to directly leap over a major realm and arbitrarily erase opponents..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his thoughts churned, Li Fan sorted out the residual impressions of the mysterious symbol he had gained from possessing the You Clan members over the past year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he handed them over to the Ultimate Separation Disc for categorization and application.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Simultaneously handling two tasks involving immortal arrays, the Ultimate Separation Disc's efficiency inevitably declined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems it's time to upgrade the Ultimate Separation Disc again. Purely relying on immortal array data for sublimation is ultimately limited by mortal physiques."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The nine initial Separation Discs of the Myriad Immortals Alliance are already completely different objects from the one I hold. The help they can provide is minimal. To completely transform into an immortal artifact Separation Disc, Immortal Spiritual Power is ultimately required..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pressed his slightly bulging forehead due to the excessive work. After relaxing, he looked at the You Clan in this realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They did not grieve for the death of the person Li Fan possessed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, they were greatly inspired by the sacrifice of their people to the great Sea of Darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing the You Clan's devout appearance, Li Fan was deeply moved. With a wave of his hand, he instantly absorbed them all into his body, temporarily suppressing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After returning to the Great Profound Small World, he would provide them with the best living conditions, allowing them to stay in Great Profound and pray wholeheartedly for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This small world should not be wasted either."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The small world inhabited by the You Clan was even weaker than Great Profound, and naturally had not yet birthed the consciousness of the Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This made Li Fan's task easier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He created a simulated Heavenly Dao consciousness, directly replacing the Heavenly Dao, to maintain the normal operation of this small world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, using the same technique, he silently grafted it onto the main Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Practice makes perfect. This time, the Heavenly Physician's technique of "Mending the Heavens Record" went very smoothly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With another simulated Heavenly Dao consciousness as a clone, subtle insights, like surging waves, frequently appeared in his mind. Although the level was insufficient, this large volume of enlightenment inspirations could still provide Li Fan with some tangible inspiration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Heavenly Dao insight is useless to me, but to other cultivators, it is a rare opportunity that they may not encounter in a lifetime." Returning to Great Profound and settling the You Clan, after converting a large portion of them to his beliefs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the dense crowd of cultivators sitting on the sermon platform in the center of Great Profound, and a thought occurred to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Humming...</p>
<p class="calibre2">A platform suddenly appeared in the sky, located below the directory of cultivation techniques and above the disciples. The platform was carved with the myriad scenes of the world, myriad spirits, and myriad things, yet it was like a living creature, constantly changing and lifelike.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If one looked closely, and if they were lucky, they would occasionally spot a seven-colored spark within the stone carvings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those were the insights of the simulated Heavenly Dao that Li Fan could not use. If any cultivator on the sermon platform were fortunate enough to decipher them, it would not be difficult for them to rapidly advance their cultivation or even comprehend their own unique divine abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The beings on the sermon platform are all under my surveillance. Their inspirations are my inspirations."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even though their realm is low, the sparks of thought, magnified countless times, remain brilliant. Even if only one out of ten thousand can provide inspiration to me, with the number of cultivators on the sermon platform, the accumulated wealth will be considerable."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, if necessary, I can also control the sermon platform and manipulate the thoughts of the cultivators on it, making them help me comprehend..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Inside the sermon platform, the silver-white sphere, like an eye, occasionally absorbed the inner inspirations of different beings from the sermon platform, becoming somewhat strange, as if it had come alive, and subtly rotated outwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Saint Master's phantom, after initially completing the sermon mission in Great Profound, further divided a body and headed to the next small world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This newly formed body was not supported by Li Fan's main body's power. Instead, it was formed by the Saint Master's phantom absorbing the belief power of his disciples during the sermon, accumulating it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was similar to the "Heavenly Emperor's Qi Codex," except that the Great Qi became Great Profound, the soldiers became students, and the Saint Emperor became the Saint Master.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this initial phase of expansion, these phantoms would act as proxies. Once the sermon began to attract the attention of the Myriad Immortals Alliance or other powerful beings hidden within the small worlds, Li Fan would personally intervene to subdue and conquer them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before that, Li Fan still needed to make thorough preparations for the future conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The You Clan who had their beliefs altered by faith began to provide Li Fan with Origin Force essence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using this Origin Force essence as bait, coupled with various other inducments, Li Fan, very skillfully, drew in familiar faces such as Bai Hua, Qiao Gong, and Yin Shangren into his alliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A great change is about to occur in heaven and earth. You all may not perceive it. I will expound upon it today."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sitting in the void, Li Fan, the Saint Master's true form, spoke solemnly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Below, Yin Shangren and others listened to Li Fan's sermon, their faces filled with skepticism.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was lecturing on the resurgence of the Star Sea, which would lead to the recovery of the Xuanhuang Realm in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They listened with mixed belief and disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled slightly, pointing to the sky, as if opening a vortex leading to the outside of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Esteemed sirs, please follow me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">His body shimmered with seven-colored rainbow light, and Li Fan invited everyone to enter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crowd exchanged glances, but ultimately, they all entered Li Fan's rainbow light protection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The seven-colored light shot up into the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Passing through the vortex in the sky, in the next moment, they suddenly appeared at the border of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Based on the momentum, it seemed they had no intention of stopping, as if they were still heading towards the Xuanhuang Realm's starry sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone's faces turned pale.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They all knew about the terrifying suction force outside the Xuanhuang Realm. Once they left the protection of the Xuanhuang Realm, they might fall into it at any moment, their lives in peril.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But what happened next far exceeded their expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The seven-colored light separated into different hues, drawing a curved arc in the starry sky, successfully leading everyone away from the Xuanhuang Realm!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone was utterly astonished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan continued to fly rapidly towards the depths of the starry sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The desolation of the starry sky evoked memories and sorrow in everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dangers within the starry sky filled them with trepidation and solemnity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan, as if he were a prophet, was able to navigate around the dangerous areas of the starry sky, earning their admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They all speculated how many times he must have traveled the starry sky to be so familiar with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as they ventured deeper into the starry sky, Li Fan's speed began to slow down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He seemed to be discerning the direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren and the others' feelings were correct. After all, in the previous life, when the Saint Emperor was comprehending the Dao in the center of the starry sky, his connection with his main body had become tenuous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, this journey to witness the resurgence of the starry sky, the further they progressed, the less memory they could draw upon, and the more Li Fan had to find the path himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, they were following a map of sorts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Relying on a vague sense of guidance, Li Fan had already touched upon the primordial consciousness of this starry sky. However, in the previous life, the Saint Emperor had achieved this by embodying the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao and acting as a potential savior of the Star Sea, attracting the attention of the Star Sea's primordial consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this life, Li Fan had not yet revealed himself in a way that warranted the Star Sea's attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this did not hinder Li Fan's subsequent plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This should be the place." Sensing that they had reached the appropriate location, Li Fan stopped and gazed into the void ahead, sighing softly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone followed his gaze, their expressions complex.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In their perception, this part of the starry sky did indeed feel different from before, seemingly brighter and warmer. However, it was still far from the "resurgence" that Li Fan had spoken of, appearing rather desolate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, since he had gone to such lengths to bring them here, he must have a reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Could it be that my comprehension is insufficient?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone present immediately harbored doubts about themselves,</p>
<p class="calibre2">And then continued to observe with utmost solemnity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan saw the subtle changes in their expressions and smiled silently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, he finally spoke, "Have you all gained anything?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">His response was silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan feigned a slight surprise, pondered for a moment, and then waved his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He sent several beams of light into everyone's sea of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These were precisely the Saint Emperor's insights into the resurgence of the Star Sea in the previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone's eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Around them, faint traces of life emerged from nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong, Bai Hua, and the others, having survived countless calamities in the Xuanhuang Realm, were all exceptionally talented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Previously, because the Star Sea's consciousness was too vast and hidden beneath the desolation and destruction, they had not perceived it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, with Li Fan directly imparting his enlightenment results into their minds,</p>
<p class="calibre2">They naturally perceived something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is indeed so!" Bai Hua was the most deeply moved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I could master this power of resurgence, perhaps I could rejuvenate the Myriad Sheng Realm..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren rubbed his head. The residual souls of shattered realms within his body seemed to be attracted by this power of resurgence, wanting to emerge from his body once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For a time, everyone was immersed in the magnificent power of the vast Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without noticing, Li Fan, who was guiding them, had subtly moved some distance away from them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, Li Fan had used a technique close to an immortal array to temporarily conceal his presence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had a premonition that revealing his existence to the primordial consciousness of the Star Sea too early would not end well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At least until I achieve the limit of mortals after completing my Dao integration." Li Fan watched the individuals comprehending the Dao, his eyes gleaming.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-325" class="calibre1">Chapter 1312: Immortal and Mortal Miasma Exterminates Immortals</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Lingering Realm Great Wall... How could such an anomaly appear on the fringes of the Star Sea?" Qiao Gong exclaimed in disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No wonder the worlds annihilated back then vanished without a trace; they all gathered at the foot of the High Wall? Lingering realms stretching endlessly, what sort of power could create such a spectacle?" Bai Hua's face was also filled with shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Both of them had survived the destruction of the Star Sea and personally witnessed countless cultivation worlds fall into desolate silence. Therefore, compared to others, they could profoundly understand the awe-inspiring nature of the Lingering Realm Great Wall that stretched beyond sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I seem to..." As if recalling a memory buried deep within his mind, Yin Shangren pressed his forehead, about to speak but stopping himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan glanced at him and didn't press further. Instead, he solemnly added, "Beyond the Lingering Realm Great Wall, there is another ring of Artifact Remnant Great Walls serving as a barrier. These two, guarding the High Wall, echo each other and form a formation. This journey ahead is more perilous than going to the center of the Star Sea, and it's even highly possible to perish..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's gaze swept over everyone, "Whether you go or not is entirely your decision."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I will give you half a year to consider. Do not blindly chase after higher-level power. Simply by returning the Profound Yellow malevolent thoughts, even if you do nothing further, you will receive ample benefits when the Great Profound Realm completes its ascension." His figure slowly vanished as he spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong and the others had varied expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, the moment they witnessed the spectacle of the Lingering Realm Great Wall, their hearts were shaken, and they felt a desire to see it for themselves. However, Li Fan's words served as a reminder.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In this Star Sea, wonders often accompanied immense power. Immense power, in turn, implied danger.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was true for the Lingering Realm Great Wall, and equally so for the Immortal Ruins.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, prompting the Great Profound Realm to absorb and digest its power only required three to four fragments of lingering realms as medicinal catalysts. It wasn't necessary for everyone to venture forth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If this endeavor proceeded smoothly, there would be plenty of opportunities in the future to contribute to the Great Profound Realm's ascension.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With these thoughts in mind, everyone began to ponder.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan observed the subtle shifts in their expressions, his eyes filled with understanding. Through countless lifetimes of reincarnation, Li Fan had come to know the natures of these individuals intimately. At a glance, he could discern their general thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Walking towards the Dao is the innate instinct of a cultivator. Yet, this path is fraught with peril and arduous. Inner fear and aversion are even greater hindrances to progress."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How difficult it is to touch upon the so-called [Dao]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching Qiao Gong and the others make their choices in the face of life, death, and the pursuit of the Dao, strands of realization welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Waiting for the celestial souls of the Super Profound Yellow Realm to merge with the Dao did not mean that Li Fan's cultivation journey would halt in the interim.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Breathing, speaking, and acting are all forms of cultivation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The myriad thoughts of all living beings are like Dao scriptures."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Preaching Platform, within the Great Profound Realm, the thoughts and wills of countless beings poured into Li Fan's mind like countless stars, each shining with a unique brilliance, and were perceived by him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They transformed into a force that propelled the grand wheel of Li Fan's cultivation forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His intention to be a teacher of heaven and earth in this life was not a whim.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In his previous life, the Saint Emperor, during his preachings, had mentioned the concept of [Resonating Dao for Longevity], which allowed one to comprehend the true meaning of resonating Dao through reversing Dao echoes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, through repeated attempts at [False Becomes True], had subtly confirmed the young girl's conjecture regarding the Saint Emperor's new method of deduction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Dao's projection from top to bottom indeed made it easier to grasp Dao itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Without projection, the Great Dao remained hidden in the nine heavens, unseen. One could only rely on cultivation and enlightenment to seek Dao's traces and then deepen their understanding step by step.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the Great Dao was manifold, how difficult was it for ordinary cultivators to glimpse the true face of Dao?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">True Immortals in the Immortal Ruins, despite having the rudimentary铭道 [Hunger] character as an aid, still meditated for millennia without breaking through.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This illustrated the difficulty of comprehending the Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If True Immortals found it so arduous, what of those below True Immortals?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Among the vast multitude of beings, Li Fan's situation was exceptionally unique. Possessing [Return to Reality], he was akin to standing at the very end of this grand Dao, with the ultimate truth of [Dao] almost within his grasp. Therefore, the seemingly impossible miracle of [False Becomes True] could be performed even with a cultivation level of only the Nascent Divinity stage.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Regarding the True and False transformations involved in [Return to Reality], Li Fan had previously only been able to comprehend them gradually by strengthening the "bond" with [Return to Reality].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, with the gradual deepening of his understanding of [False Becomes True], and after his prior contact with that mysterious symbol hidden deep within the You Clan members' bodies,</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan faintly sensed that he could use methods of analogy and inference to deduce the progress of the True and False transformations by starting from other Dao traces.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dao projected itself across myriad realms, forming all existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything within the Great Profound Realm, be it matter or consciousness, could be considered a projection of Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, being at the very end of the projection, it was almost an impossible task to trace the Dao from the bottom up.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, as the sole surviving land within the Star Sea, the Great Profound Realm had already gathered countless impossibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For instance, the Eternal Remnants, singular existences that resonated with the Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In this life, Li Fan had previously visited the Tianyang Cave dwelling at the bottom of the Cyan Cloud Sea. He had collected the Tianyang Ancient Bones, which contained Eternal Remnants, but had tried various methods without success in sensing the Dao resonance within them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan would not abandon his research on Dao resonance. Instead, he turned his attention to finding a lesser substitute for Eternal Remnants.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the 119th life, Li Fan had used the Faceless True Immortal statue as a guide to create the mortal world's "Network of Red Dust Compassion True Immortals." Among its countless followers, only Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi's intentions shone with exceptional brilliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even within the Origin Power Essence network, they were exceptionally conspicuous.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They were undoubtedly [Seekers of the Dao with Utmost Sincerity].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Previously, Li Fan believed this was merely due to their inherent character. To Li Fan himself, it held no other benefit. But now, Li Fan discovered that Kou Hong and the two others' sincere pursuit of the Dao might very well be the nascent form of Eternal Remnants.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, if they could be guided appropriately to deepen their pursuit of the Dao, upon Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi's deaths, there might be a probability of birthing [Eternal Remnants].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I cannot utilize Eternal Remnants myself, but can I not utilize their lesser substitutes?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This discovery from Kou Hong and the two others inspired Li Fan. Coupled with the need to merge the celestial souls of the Super Great Profound Realm with the Dao, and on the spur of the moment, he became the "Teacher of Heaven and Earth" in this life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Preaching Platform, the myriad intentions of beings from the Great Profound Realm gathered, like stars in the sky, each shining with a different intensity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Those who were distinct would receive Li Fan's special attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, he had not yet found anyone who could potentially ascend to Eternal Remnants.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan believed that once the Preaching Platform eventually expanded to encompass the entire Great Profound Realm, besides Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, there should be others who could provide surprises.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Kou Hong and the two others, their current experiences were still somewhat lacking compared to their past selves as utmost sincere seekers of the Dao. Taking them as disciples would instead hinder their pursuit of the Dao. Therefore, Li Fan had not yet interfered with them, and had even added extra difficulty to their cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He would wait for the opportune moment when their efforts bore fruit before reaping the rewards.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao's projection forms myriad realms; there will always be beings within the worlds whose existence resonates with Dao's traces."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"These are the materials I can use to enhance my comprehension of the [True and False Transformations]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having personally experienced the power of [False Becomes True], Li Fan had decided to prioritize promoting this matter as the second highest priority, second only to self-preservation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for realms, cultivation, and treasures.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Things that could be acquired in every reincarnation were simply incomparable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, I believe these brilliant intentions of living beings, like Eternal Remnants, can only be comprehended once. I wonder how many individuals in the entire Great Profound Realm can surprise me."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's divine sense swept across the land, observing the Great Profound citizens who were still ceaselessly arriving at the central Preaching Platform. He nodded slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His figure flickered, and the next moment, Li Fan had already left the Great Profound Small World.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He arrived at Qiling Prefecture in the Great Profound Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the vast, empty underground space, an invisible, eerie aura permeated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with Li Fan's current cultivation, he had gathered sufficient Origin Force Essence for protection before daring to enter.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A golden thread of light formed a protective formation, separating Li Fan from the terrifying power within this underground space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"My guess was correct. This ancient Immortal-Mortal Blight has also undergone an evolutionary transformation along with the Great Profound Realm," Li Fan concluded after careful observation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the 119th life, a famine occurred in Qiling Prefecture, and the ancient Immortal-Mortal Blight sealed here leaked out, causing widespread devastation. Accumulated over thousands of years in this underground space, this ancient Immortal-Mortal Blight seemed to have undergone a mutation, becoming even more powerful than its initial version.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal-Mortal Blight was created by Mr. Bai against the principles of heaven and earth, yet it was also a part of the principles of heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As this life's Great Profound Realm began its evolution towards becoming a Super Profound Yellow Realm, the ancient Immortal-Mortal Blight in this underground space was also accumulating the power for transformation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mortal can also slay Immortals..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan extended his hand, and the golden protective formation opened. An invisible force seized the opportunity to infiltrate and began to erode Li Fan's palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His brows furrowed. After merely a moment of observation, Li Fan decisively severed his entire arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, Origin Force Essence re-formed the protective barrier, blocking the erosion of the Immortal-Mortal Blight.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Interesting."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the time it took to breathe, Li Fan's severed arm had already regrown.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the arm that remained in the ancient Immortal-Mortal Blight, it was completely consumed by the surrounding invisible forces.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not even a bone remained, only a pile of fine sand-like residue.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A rare spark of excitement flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Among his bindings under [Return to Reality], there was an item called [Ten Thousand People's Essence Blood], condensed from tens of thousands of condemned criminals.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the power of the Immortal-Mortal Blight contained within this Ten Thousand People's Essence Blood was inferior to this enhanced ancient Immortal-Mortal Blight.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the Super Profound Yellow Realm completes its final transformation, to what extent will the Immortal-Mortal Blight here be enhanced?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In Li Fan's deductions, the power of the Star Sea's resurgence, the Immortal Spiritual Power from the Great Heavenly Venerate's legacy, and the remnants of various realms within the Star Sea...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These forces, all working together, were sufficient to elevate the Great Profound Realm to a level infinitely close to the Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Or, in a sense, this Super Profound Yellow Realm was a newly ascended Immortal Realm. It was just a notch weaker than the ancient Immortal Realm that had already been destroyed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, even if 'slaying Immortals' is not fully possible, being able to inflict heavy damage might be achievable."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"More importantly, this ancient Immortal-Mortal Blight can continuously strengthen itself as the Great Profound Realm grows. Its inherent nature of [Mortal Slaying Immortals] dictates its significant role."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"One day, when I have the capability to truly elevate the Great Profound Realm to an Immortal Realm, then this Immortal-Mortal Blight will become a genuine immortal-slaying weapon!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With this thought, Li Fan's gaze towards the invisible forces within this vast space changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From Xuan Tianwang's past encounter, and some clues gleaned from those exploring beyond the High Wall,</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It could be inferred that achieving immortality within the Star Sea might involve facing unimaginable dangers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And the birth of an Immortal Domain might attract attention, but since it would not be Li Fan's main body, even if crises arose, it would provide Li Fan with ample time to react.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ascending to immortality oneself, versus facilitating the Great Profound Realm's ascension to an Immortal Domain &ndash; which was harder?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unless one was insane, everyone would undoubtedly choose the latter.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But for Li Fan, the conclusion was the opposite.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Great Heavenly Venerate's legacy, the Immortal Spiritual Power within the Immortal Artifacts, these are all resources that I can repeatedly utilize infinitely."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, there are all sorts of other materials and powers within the entire Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's thoughts raced rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it's feasible."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I simply need to wait until the end of this life and observe how much the Super Profound Yellow Realm, which I have facilitated, falls short of the legendary Immortal Realm before making a final judgment."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The transformation of this ancient Immortal-Mortal Blight had opened up Li Fan's perspective.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Great Profound Realm, countless materialized laws existed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once the Great Profound Realm ascended, these materialized laws would also undergo a corresponding elevation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The entire Great Profound Realm can be viewed as my weapon against Immortals."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a distinction between mortal and immortal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if this mortal were backed by an entire Immortal Realm, the ultimate outcome might be different.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The situation beyond the High Wall is unclear."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Using the realm as a foundation might make it easier to investigate."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cautiously set up formations around this underground space,</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Preventing others from discovering the Immortal-Mortal Blight sealed here.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Continue to grow. When you reach your limit, it will be time to forge swords."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After ensuring everything was foolproof, Li Fan finally departed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the plan is feasible, then it is time for me to collect some anchors."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Things that can slay Immortals, naturally, the more the merrier."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking this, Li Fan quietly arrived in the void of the Five Elements Great Blessed Land in Tianling Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point in time, the Five Elements Great Blessed Land had not fully descended.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was an opportune moment to absorb and replenish the conditions for anchors: a nascent blessed land.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan had already used the Five Elements Great Blessed Land for charging once before. He was unsure if [Return to Reality] would react again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Skillfully, he entered the black and white intertwined gestation space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan concentrated his mind, perceiving the sensations transmitted by [Return to Reality].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's somewhat difficult to swallow, but edible nonetheless."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long time, Li Fan opened his eyes, his expression somewhat peculiar.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He calmed his mind, and his divine sense instantly enveloped the entire Five Elements Great Blessed Land.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a period of time...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The blessed land inexplicably vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And another anchor that Li Fan could utilize became available.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan felt a premonition that one more time, and [Return to Reality] would truly lose its appetite.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike before, when he consumed blessed lands that had already descended, the Five Elements Great Blessed Land was still undergoing gestation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Its sudden disappearance naturally caused spatial anomalies.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-326" class="calibre1">Chapter 1313: The Great Formation of Floating Crossing</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless black and white lines instantly came alive, altering their original trajectories and flying towards Li Fan. They were like tentacles, aiming to entangle and restrain him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This place was called the "Root of Heaven and Earth," the location where the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven was gestated. Black and white lines crisscrossed, like a colossal weaving machine, knitting the Xuanhuang world. Not only the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, but also the initial mountains, rivers, and blessed lands of the Xuanhuang Realm were born from here. It was the origin of the world, the confluence of laws, the beginning of creation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When Li Fan first witnessed this magnificent spectacle, he could only marvel at the wonders of creation and seize this rare opportunity to comprehend the fleeting fragments of primordial laws within the Root of Heaven and Earth. Now, after over a hundred reincarnations, Li Fan saw many things he couldn't perceive before.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For instance, though faint and almost integrated into the entire space of the Root of Heaven and Earth, there were still… man-made traces, influencing the overall operation from the foundational level.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing the instinctive attacks of the countless black and white lines within the Root of Heaven and Earth, Li Fan did not dodge or evade. He allowed them to deeply penetrate his body. Under normal circumstances, a cultivator who met such an attack here would soon have their own body, also composed of countless lines, disperse and dissolve, vanishing completely within this space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But at this moment, an inexplicable immense force existed within Li Fan's body, firmly anchoring his own lines. No matter how the Root of Heaven and Earth tried to absorb him, he remained immobile!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Naturally, the anchor that held Li Fan immovably in place was the sliver of [Transformation of Truth and Falsehood] he had comprehended. Almost all creations originating from the Xuanhuang Realm struggled to resist the attacks of the Root of Heaven and Earth, which returned to their origins. However, the [Transformation of Truth and Falsehood], stemming from [Return to Reality], was far beyond what the Root of Heaven and Earth could analyze and differentiate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, scattered gray imprints spread deep into the Root of Heaven and Earth along the countless lines inserted into him. These were not the world-destroying True Immortal script, but rather countless divine senses that Li Fan had differentiated, intending to use this attack to probe the mysteries of the Root of Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Innumerable scenes flashed before his eyes. In the void, light flickered and pulsed. Each change in brightness represented tens of billions of interweaving lines. From nothingness to existence, from darkness, worlds were being born.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">*Boom!* Just as Li Fan's mind was immersed in observation, the mysterious scenes abruptly shattered. It turned out that the Root of Heaven and Earth had sensed Li Fan's intent to invade. All the lines inserted into Li Fan instantly faded, dissolving and disappearing. Li Fan's connection with the Root of Heaven and Earth was severed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even more so, the lines that were weaving creations in his vision slowly retreated into the void, becoming impossible to observe. The light suddenly brightened; Li Fan had been repelled by the Root of Heaven and Earth and returned to the Xuanhuang Tianling Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A pity."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The instinctive crisis reaction was still swift."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Though he said this, he didn't feel much regret. Li Fan narrowed his eyes, recalling the "man-made traces" he had glimpsed just now. Probing the details of the Root of Heaven and Earth was merely a guise; Li Fan's true objective was to attract its attention, thereby enabling him to sense more of the hidden imprints.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The imprints were both new and old. If the new traces could be dimly discerned with Li Fan's current strength, then the old imprints were difficult to distinguish. He could only rely on the familiar aura he had glimpsed before to instinctively sense their existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The age of the imprints was relative. Even the new traces were thousands of years old.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven was the work of the Yi Shi Sect. To counter the tribulations of world-ending calamity, they guided the generation of laws within the Xuanhuang Root of Heaven and Earth."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With the Five Elements complete and flowing harmoniously, a realm was formed. Every time a Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven was gestated, it was a great depletion for the Xuanhuang Realm. It was like a mortal woman giving birth; normally, one would be the limit. However, within the Xuanhuang Realm's Root of Heaven and Earth, the Yi Shi Sect's guidance remained. Thus, this gestation process would never cease..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyes gleamed as he understood the origin and reason behind the new traces. He pointed a finger forward, and even though he felt a powerful repulsive force, Li Fan still used his own strength to forcefully push his way back in. It was as if he had poked a hornet's nest; the countless black and white lines within the Root of Heaven and Earth instantly surged. They all rushed towards Li Fan, as if determined to fight to the death.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, Li Fan no longer played the role of a target. As his figure flickered, he evaded the attacks of the Root of Heaven and Earth, using his finger as a knife to sever the imprints left by the Yi Shi Sect one by one.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">*Humming...* The Root of Heaven and Earth vibrated in response. It must have understood Li Fan's intentions. The previously enraged lines turned gentle. Returning to its original state, it became calm once more. In the flash of an eye, Li Fan had destroyed all the traces imprinted by the Yi Shi Sect within the Root of Heaven and Earth. From then on, no new Five Elements Great Grotto-Heavens would be gestated in the Xuanhuang Realm. After all, Li Fan planned to promote the birth of a Super Xuanhuang Realm, and the gestation of the Five Elements Grotto-Heavens was a genuine depletion of the Xuanhuang Realm's power. Li Fan naturally would not allow such a thing to continue.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heavens, but also other unnecessary grotto-heavens within the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan would prevent their appearance, accumulating power for the Xuanhuang Realm. The repulsive force from the Root of Heaven and Earth had completely disappeared, allowing Li Fan to examine the ancient, almost imperceptible old traces more carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected. It's exactly the same as the ancient immortal array protecting the Nine Stars Crimson Pearls."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The ancient imprints, like natural birthmarks, were almost integrated into the space of the Root of Heaven and Earth. If Li Fan hadn't been fortunate enough to see similar existences before, he would have mistaken them for characteristics of the Root of Heaven and Earth itself. A part of the imprint had already penetrated the space itself, so Li Fan could not discern the original appearance of this immortal array. However, when compared with the existing array deduction data within the ultimate separation disc, most of it matched.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Finally found you." Li Fan's eyes shone with brilliance. The Vast Crossing Star Sea Array, in Li Fan's previous deductions, was composed of four sub-arrays. In his previous reincarnations, Li Fan had already identified three-quarters of them. These were the golden chains used to lock onto and capture outer cultivation worlds; the Heaven-Beast Eye, serving as an observation station; and the Gloomy Sea, which helped escape the suction of the Immortal Ruins, also known as the Spirit Gathering and Immortal Ascension Array. The remaining one, however, could not be found anywhere in the Xuanhuang Realm. Even during the world-ending immortal array in the previous life, Li Fan couldn't pinpoint its possible location. He hadn't expected that by returning to his old stomping grounds in this life to absorb anchors, he would have an unexpected surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Vast Crossing Star Sea Array should have been modified by Xuan Tianwang based on the original world-protecting immortal array." "Unlike the other formations, the modifications here are very slight, almost as if it were untouched." "With the constant weaving and creation of the Root of Heaven and Earth, even when navigating the star sea, the Xuanhuang Realm has the ability to constantly repair and even grow." "This self-growth, unlike the stitching together of fragmented realms by the Dharma Transmitter and Heavenly Physician, does not cause the anomalies of conflicting world laws or side effects during the fusion process..." A scene suddenly appeared before Li Fan's eyes. In the endless dark void, the Xuanhuang Realm was like a colossal starship, slowly moving forward. The Heaven-Beast Eye was responsible for observation and Locus, the golden chains searched for external enemies and collected resources; the Gloomy Sea provided endless power; and the Root of Heaven and Earth was responsible for repair and growth. This was a perfect survival strategy for the star sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Vast Crossing Star Sea, Vast Crossing Star Sea." "With this formation, it is indeed possible to traverse the star sea and overcome all calamities. Xuan Tianwang is truly a peerless genius!" Li Fan praised him sincerely.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What a pity..." "Such a remarkable person, at the verge of ascending to immortality, suddenly met with misfortune." Li Fan's eyes narrowed. Xuan Tianwang's disappearance was one of the biggest mysteries in the Xuanhuang Realm's history. Even after so many reincarnations and with the world-ending immortal array revealing all hidden truths, Li Fan still couldn't uncover the truth. He could only vaguely guess that the process of officially ascending to immortality might carry immense risks.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although Xuan Tianwang is no longer present, this Vast Crossing Star Sea Array can be used by me." "Previously, I speculated that Xuan Tianwang might have hidden in the final Vast Crossing Star Sea Array after his mysterious disappearance. But now it seems..." Because Li Fan had aided in "birth control," the Root of Heaven and Earth had decided to forgive his previous actions of devouring the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heavens. However, it did not generate any positive feelings. It merely allowed Li Fan to roam freely within this confluence of laws. This place, though seemingly boundless, was an illusion created by the intricate weaving of laws and immortal arrays. Li Fan, being proficient in formations, did not get lost. He quickly searched the entire interior of the Root of Heaven and Earth. As Li Fan had suspected, there were no traces of Xuan Tianwang's potential presence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"During the world-ending immortal array in the previous life, I never saw Mo Ruobin either." "If he were within the Xuanhuang Realm, with his strength, he would certainly have been able to resist to some extent. Could it be..." Li Fan frowned. Mo Ruobin had no reason to abandon his long-held goal and flee the Xuanhuang Realm. Therefore, there was a high probability that he had gone to the [Heaven-Beast Eye] located somewhere unknown outside the Xuanhuang Realm. "The Heaven-Beast Eye can serve as a reconnaissance array for Vast Crossing Star Sea. Its observation range should be even wider than I imagined, perhaps even beyond the void of the realms..." A glimmer of realization flashed in Li Fan's mind. "The Vast Crossing Star Sea Array is almost integrated with the Xuanhuang Realm. Perhaps the Heaven-Beast Eye can also reverse its gaze and observe the Xuanhuang Realm itself. However, Mo Ruobin might not know its exact location, and rashly searching the star sea carries a certain risk. That's why in the 119th life, he chose not to pursue this path when I pretended to cooperate with him. And in the previous life, when he was pursued by the Saint Emperor's clone and had nowhere to run, he was forced to make that choice." Li Fan knew about the Heaven-Beast Eye from a unfortunate soul who was randomly teleported there while using a teleportation array from Jiushan Prefecture. He even encountered the Heavenly Physician who sensed its aura. Fortunately, relying on his wit, he gained the Heavenly Physician's trust and, as a result, obtained the secret Heavenly Physician technique, the "Mending Heaven Records." The chance of being randomly teleported to the Heaven-Beast Eye was extremely slim, so Li Fan naturally wouldn't try it himself. However, Jiushan Prefecture was formed from the bones of the Heaven-Beast, and it must have some connection with the distant Heaven-Beast Eye. Perhaps this connection could be used to locate the Heaven-Beast Eye. "The Vast Crossing Star Sea Array is also extremely important for the sublimation of the Xuanhuang Realm in this life." "Although the array is broken, if I can repair and re-activate it..." During Xuan Tianwang's era, the Vast Crossing Star Sea Array only covered a small area of the original Xuanhuang Realm, which was the central core region compared to the current merged Xuanhuang Realm. "But by expanding the array, I can control the Xuanhuang Realm without anyone's knowledge." The ultimate separation disc was too busy with its numerous tasks to assist. Li Fan relied solely on his own understanding of formations to deduce. In his sea of consciousness, the Vast Crossing Star Sea Array radiated from the center, gradually covering the Xuanhuang light mass, eventually transforming into a colossal starship. "When expanding and rebuilding the formation, I can incorporate the world-ending immortal array I comprehended in my previous life." "When the Xuanhuang Realm finally completes its transformation, even if the descended immortal soul is incredibly powerful and beyond my expectations, with the formation as a restraint, it will be impossible for it to escape my grasp," Li Fan mused inwardly. It had to be said that working on the shoulders of giants made things much easier. With Xuan Tianwang's foundation, Li Fan could save more than half the effort in his plans. Or rather, without Xuan Tianwang's arrangements, Li Fan, with his current formation cultivation, would find it impossible to build a new Vast Crossing Star Sea Array. "There is still too little information about the four formations of the Vast Crossing Star Sea Array." Li Fan's thoughts naturally turned to Mo Ruobin. In his battle with the Saint Emperor in the previous life, Mo Ruobin's techniques were all seen by him. As long as he made arrangements in advance, Li Fan was confident he could handle him. The time of being toyed with by Mo Ruobin was over, and it was time for reckoning. However... before seeking revenge on Mo Ruobin and seeking information, Li Fan first visited another Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect. Dongyong Prefecture, the impact crater. Flowers of spiritual energy filled the air, a beautiful sight. Li Fan knew that hidden within these exquisite flowers were the memories of Ji Yuzhen, one of the former Dharma Kings of the Xuan Tian Sect. Or rather... soul fragments. Ji Yuzhen cultivated the Immeasurable Heavenly Pivot Divine Separation Technique. Even Xuan Tianwang, Xuanyuan Hong, praised this divine technique as unparalleled in his lifetime. Although Ji Yuzhen appeared to have perished, there was still a flicker of hope, hidden within these countless soul flowers. In the latter part of his previous life, amidst the world-ending immortal array storm, this place was one of the few remaining bright spots in the Myriad Immortals Alliance’s territory. "My previous soul-searching technique should still have some flaws." "Ji Yuzhen's memories still hide true secrets." Li Fan's eyes flashed with brilliance. A seemingly ordinary white circle suddenly appeared in his hand. This was [Descending to the Mortal Realm]. He tossed it upwards gently, and the white circle instantly enveloped the entire impact crater. It fell silently, transforming everything it covered into spiritual energy. The vast impact crater, inch by inch, cracked open. The soul flowers, integrated with the mountain and hidden within, almost impossible to detect by ordinary means, slowly floated out.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-327" class="calibre1">Chapter 1314: Memory of Ji Yuzhen</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Memory of Ji Yuzhen</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After cultivating the "Myriad Spirits Severing Divinity Art," there was a distinction between the myriad soul clones and the primordial soul. What Li Fan had found earlier in the circular mountain of Dongyong Prefecture were merely memories from one of the myriad soul clones.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the truly important primordial soul had never been discovered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't until the white circle, "Descending to the Mortal Realm," acted upon the circular mountain, annihilating it completely, that the primordial soul hidden within was finally revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike the myriad spiritual energy flowers scattered outside, the soul flowers hidden within the circular mountain seemed to remain dormant. Even when Li Fan actively contacted them, they did not attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As these soul flowers were exposed after losing their hiding place, they began to gather spontaneously in a patterned manner, slowly coalescing into a giant, radiant white flower. Within the circular mountain region, the countless spiritual energy flowers drifting in the heavens and earth seemed to have found their leader and began to revolve around the luminous white flower.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the rising storm, the primordial soul flower gradually became like the spiritual energy flowers, seemingly attempting to conceal itself through this method. Unfortunately, at the instant the circular mountain disintegrated and the soul flowers scattered outwards, Li Fan's immense divine sense had already locked onto all of them. How could a clumsy illusionary technique possibly deceive Li Fan?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan soon realized he was mistaken. When his divine sense came into contact with a piece of the primordial soul flower, the scenes transmitted from within made Li Fan feel a sense of familiarity. It was precisely the scenes he had encountered before in the ordinary spiritual energy flowers!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected, there is some skill involved. Even when locked onto by me, it can silently transfer and swap…" Looking at the trillions of flowers before him, Li Fan snorted coldly, "But since I've discovered you, how can you escape now!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You hide within the endless sea of flowers, so I shall boil the sea!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang World-Ending Transformation: [Heavenly Punishment and Earthly Destruction, Gathering Souls and Creating Life]!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Overpowering malevolent energy surged from Li Fan's body. Li Fan's eyes turned completely black, the malevolent energy condensing into tangible form, like countless tiny tentacles swaying in the wind. Within this black malevolent energy, faint bolts of lightning could be seen, as if heavenly punishment was descending, intending to annihilate all living beings in the world!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a variation of Li Fan's Xuanhuang World-Ending Transformation. When Xuanhuang encountered a desperate situation of destruction, for its own survival, it would annihilate all living beings within the realm, absorbing their flesh and blood, and souls, to increase its chances of withstanding the world-ending crisis. This transformation was even more extreme than the "[Heaven and Earth Fall Silent, All Things Froze Still]" that Li Fan had used before. It was a desperate gamble, a survival transformation where only oneself exists.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Above the Dongyong Prefecture, boundless black clouds rolled in from the horizon. This was the reaction of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, sensing the extreme change occurring in this location. Li Fan even sensed that because of the birth of this Heaven and Earth transformation, the Xuanhuang Realm's attitude towards him was rapidly deteriorating. The goodwill he had painstakingly accumulated moments ago had almost instantly vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan did not care. The malevolent energy tentacles continuously differentiated into new branches, enveloping all the spiritual energy flowers they could touch and piercing into them fiercely. The spiritual energy flowers withered one by one. Simultaneously, streams of incomparably pure, yet eerily strange energy, were absorbed and concentrated, mixed with various fragmented memory snippets. Some were Ji Yuzhen's, others belonged to cultivators who had perished here.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan classified and organized those belonging to Ji Yuzhen, gradually piecing together complete scenes. At the same time, he focused his attention, waiting for the primordial soul clones to be discovered. The immortal techniques of the Xuan Tian Sect each had their own mysterious aspects. To be safe, Li Fan did not greedily absorb the energy transformed from these spiritual energy flowers directly. Instead, he gathered them in one place and sealed them with Origin Force Essence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The black tentacles brandished themselves wantonly. The sea of flowers disappeared in large swathes at a rate visible to the naked eye. Soon, the first primordial soul clone could no longer hide and was found by Li Fan. Without fully draining or destroying the soul, he merely peered into the memories hidden within the soul.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">*Boom!* Like a fleeting glimpse of a life, images rapidly flashed by. As if covered in a layer of white light, they flickered intermittently, like flowers seen through mist, appearing and disappearing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhen'er, have you remembered how to activate the [Golden Lock Across the Heavens Formation]?" Xuan Tianwang's voice echoed, but his face was hidden beneath the white light, making him indistinguishable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Xuanyuan, do you think I'm that foolish in your heart?" Ji Yuzhen said with a hint of teasing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Tianwang quickly explained, "Zhen'er, don't misunderstand. I know your talent is no less than mine. However, this formation is an improvement based on an immortal formation. The difference between immortal and mortal is something that, unless personally experienced, is difficult to grasp correctly."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since Brother Xuanyuan is so worried, teach me again then." Ji Yuzhen said softly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Uh… alright." Xuan Tianwang hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement. He said solemnly, "Golden locks across the heavens, spanning all realms. Even if the target is at the far end of the distant star sea, once locked onto, the chains can reach it in an instant and capture it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I've told you before that this effect is achieved because it's embedded with the [Distance Within Reach] great array. This array was originally inscribed on the Ascension Platform in the Immortal Realm, and I moved the entire immortal array down when I escaped…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ji Yuzhen looked at Xuan Yuanhong, as if seeing him collecting immortal artifacts from the Immortal Realm while escaping for his life. She couldn't help but let out a soft laugh again, "Even though it's not the first time you've told me, I still find it hard to imagine that Brother Xuanyuan could be such a person."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Yuanhong coughed awkwardly, "The Immortal Realm suffered a catastrophe, which would inevitably affect the lower realms. Naturally, I had to make more preparations. Besides, they were ownerless objects anyway…" Xuan Tianwang earnestly defended himself, then continued his explanation, "The deviation of star sea spacetime means that the location observed by the Heaven-Beast Eye in the cultivation world might have a slight error compared to its actual location. Therefore, when using the golden lock for capture, corresponding adjustments must be made. Currently, there is no good way to resolve this deviation, so it relies entirely on the host's experience and intuition."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The [Distance Within Reach] great array consumes a lot. After a period of use, it needs to be repaired and replenished. However, there's no need to worry about damage. I've already replicated three main copies of the core components. At most, the capture efficiency will decrease, but it won't affect the array's usage..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Tianwang explained in great detail, and Ji Yuzhen listened to every word. However, her gaze remained fixed on Xuan Yuanhong's face, never shifting away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning from the memory to reality, Li Fan carefully sealed this primordial soul clone. Then, he turned his attention to the rest of the sea of flowers. As more incorrect options were eliminated, the collection of primordial soul clones accelerated. Ji Yuzhen's memories emerged one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Vaguely, in a secret chamber. Ji Yuzhen and Xuan Yuanhong stood facing each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Xuanyuan, you've finally opened your eyes. Inviting me here alone." Ji Yuzhen's beautiful eyes rippled slightly as she gazed at Xuan Tianwang.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhen'er, stop fooling around. We have important matters today." Xuan Yuanhong said earnestly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The other eleven brothers have all chosen their immortal techniques, but you've been hesitant…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I said, I want Brother Xuanyuan to choose for me." Ji Yuzhen interrupted Xuan Yuanhong.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Yuanhong revealed a helpless expression, "I sought you out precisely for this matter."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Xuanyuan has already picked it for me?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Myriad Spirits Severing Divinity Art. Even among the numerous immortal techniques I've collected, it is a top-tier existence. It allows for myriad soul clones, making the soul unending and indestructible. More importantly, it can nurture one's soul and differentiate primordial souls. Each primordial soul can ascend its own immortal path…" Xuan Tianwang spoke eloquently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I believe in Big Brother. I'll cultivate this one." Before Xuan Tianwang could finish, Ji Yuzhen decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Yuanhong paused, then nodded slightly. He pointed a finger at his own brow, and then dark characters flew out from it. Xuan Yuanhong closed his eyes, his expression calm, only occasionally furrowing his brows as if enduring immense pain.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The divine is the flower of life. Wandering the void, its splendor is like the new green of spring willows, abundant but not chaotic, divisible yet capable of reunion…" The moment she saw those undulating dark characters, an extremely profound cultivation technique appeared in her mind. Not only the content of the technique but also countless memories of cultivating it and specific insights. Although she was just beginning, it was as if she had reincarnated thousands of times and had cultivated it countless times.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After an unknown period, the dark characters slowly returned to Xuan Tianwang's sea of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Xuanyuan, are you alright?" Ji Yuzhen asked with concern, stepping forward to check on him. Xuan Yuanhong's face suddenly flashed with myriad distorted countenances, attempting to take over. However, in the end, it returned to Xuan Yuanhong's original face.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Xuanyuan, you could have just transferred the technique. Why use this method of inheritance?" Ji Yuzhen's tone carried a hint of blame.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Yuanhong sighed softly, "Zhen'er, the complexity of immortal techniques is far beyond that of lower realm cultivation methods. Although your talent is extraordinary, without the guidance of inheritance, it would take more than ten years to even begin cultivating the Severing Divinity Art. We don't have that much time…"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ji Yuzhen remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Yuanhong added, "Moreover, looking at the cultivation progress of the other eleven brothers, there's a clear difference whether they received inheritance or not. It should be a limitation of the technique itself within the [Azure Nether Pearl]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This [Azure Nether Pearl] might not be a good thing," Ji Yuzhen snorted coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xuan Yuanhong did not agree, "There is no distinction between good and evil in cultivation methods; it all depends on the cultivator. This Azure Nether Pearl is the same." "It can absorb the corpses of fallen cultivators and refine the cultivation methods they practiced, which is enough to show the extraordinary nature of this treasure." "It's a pity I obtained it too late. I only managed to glance at the nearby corpses before hastily leaving," Xuan Yuanhong said regretfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Scene after scene flashed through Li Fan's mind. All of them were the life stories of Ji Yuzhen, a Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect in her past. Compared to the fragments preserved in the spiritual energy flowers before, the memories within the primordial soul were more complete. Moreover, they all involved numerous secrets of Xuan Tianwang of the Xuan Tian Sect. For instance, the origin of the Xuan Tian Sect Dharma Kings' cultivation of immortal techniques, and the mysterious immortal treasure, the Azure Nether Pearl. Also, the methods for activating and controlling the Floating Crossing Great Array and the Golden Lock Across the Heavens. And then, the moments Ji Yuzhen and Xuan Yuanhong spent together.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, what puzzled Li Fan was that the memories within the primordial soul here were still incomplete. Certain crucial fragments were missing. Li Fan swept his gaze around, ensuring no other stray spiritual energy flowers were present. "Did it escape while I wasn't paying attention? Or…" "Were those primordial soul clones never preserved in the first place?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From Ji Yuzhen's memories, Li Fan obtained the complete content of the Severing Divinity Art. Although there was no so-called inheritance guidance, allowing for initial entry, he had a general understanding of this immortal technique's content. Besides being able to split into myriad souls, be indestructible, and immortal, the primordial soul had another greater function: after achieving the Dao, it could serve as a medicinal catalyst. Whether consumed by oneself or others, it could perfectly merge and combine two completely different Dao paths.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">True Immortals pursued a single Great Dao. A Great Dao is singular. Not only would it repel other cultivators practicing this Dao, but it would also be difficult to cultivate two different Dao paths simultaneously. However, the Severing Divinity Art could cleverly resolve this limitation. The healing effect of consuming primordial souls was insignificant compared to this heaven-defying [Dao Integration] function.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"From the memories I previously obtained, when Xuan Tianwang was injured, Ji Yuzhen had intended to feed him her primordial soul." "Now that her most important primordial soul clone is missing, could it be that she found Xuan Tianwang at the last moment and sacrificed herself to him?" Li Fan couldn't help but speculate. Ji Yuzhen clearly loved Xuan Tianwang deeply. However, for some unknown reason, Xuan Yuanhong had never accepted her affections and had even deliberately maintained a distance. Sacrificing herself to save Xuan Tianwang was entirely something Ji Yuzhen would do.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuan Tianwang." Li Fan murmured to himself, looking up at the sky. The accumulated dark clouds in the Xuanhuang Realm had reached their limit, as if they could descend at any moment. Li Fan had absorbed all of Ji Yuzhen's scattered soul clones and removed the "Heavenly Punishment and Earthly Destruction" transformation. His figure flickered, and he disappeared from the spot. The anomalies in the sky also dissipated. The cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, who had been blocked by an invisible barrier outside, arrived late. Discovering the circular mountain and spiritual energy flowers that had vanished into thin air, they were greatly alarmed and quickly reported to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not immediately go to find Mo Rubin. Instead, he first entered seclusion to digest the memories from Ji Yuzhen's soul clones. The life of a Dharma King, even with the most crucial parts missing, was still immense. Especially within the primordial soul, it contained not only memories but also thoughts and emotions of that time. While probing, he was inevitably tainted by these emotions. To prevent himself from being influenced and Ji Yuzhen from taking over, Li Fan had to pause after experiencing each segment of memory and dispel those infiltrating emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The memories of Ji Yuzhen's first meeting with Xuan Tianwang are also missing. It seems to be the important reason why she fell in love with Xuan Tianwang, and one of her most precious memories." "However, Ji Yuzhen's memories of the other eleven Dharma Kings have been preserved."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-328" class="calibre1">Chapter 1315: The Law King of Xuan Tian Sect</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Discussing research findings..." Li Fan contemplated for a long time before finally agreeing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong let out a long sigh. He conjured black and white free-floating lines with his hands, writing characters in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, please observe." Zhong Daogong said with utmost seriousness. Even though they were in the无人 (wúrén - deserted/unmanned) depths of the Star Sea, he still set up a prohibition around them to prevent the characters from leaking.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The characters flickered faintly, like living creatures, swirling and flowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan glanced at them and remarked casually, "So it's [Hate]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, Daoist friend's [Hate] seems to have some slight errors."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to speak, he heard Li Fan say proudly, "But watch how I write this [Hate] character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With swift and elegant strokes, another character, seemingly identical, suddenly appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two [Hate] characters stood side by side.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at the True Immortal script Li Fan had written, first stunned. Then, his body trembled uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Great Elder of the Severed Immortal Tower and the cultivator most deeply involved in researching True Immortal scripts within the Profound Immortal Boat, Zhong Daogong could naturally discern the subtle differences between these two characters.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Judging from the faint fluctuations emanating from the two characters, the completeness of the inscription by the other party was clearly superior to his own!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the degree of advancement seemed to far exceed that of the [Li] character encountered earlier!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This, this..." Repeatedly struck, Zhong Daogong found it difficult to accept. However, his research instincts, honed over years, made him temporarily set aside all other thoughts and focus on deciphering the [Hate] character Li Fan had written.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Each subtle modification brought the inscription closer to its original intent. If he were to explore it himself, it would likely take decades to reach this level.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, a single glance was equivalent to countless nights of painstaking research.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong naturally did not know that the [Hate] character Li Fan had written was from his own future self, decades later. At this moment, only one thought resonated in his mind:</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He must "invite" this cultivator back to the Profound Immortal Boat, by any means necessary!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">True Immortal scripts were simply too important for the Profound Immortal Boat. Every additional inscription known undoubtedly allowed the Immortal Boat to greatly enhance its combat power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, the crucial plan conceived by the Immortal Boat required the collection of as many different types of True Immortal scripts as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With this thought, after deeply imprinting the new [Hate] character in his mind, Zhong Daogong turned to look at Li Fan and sighed, "Daoist friend's skill is profound, I am far inferior!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However... in my homeland, there are still over a dozen scholars like me who study True Immortal scripts. They have delved deep for many years, and their understanding of True Immortal scripts is no less than mine... If Daoist friend is willing to share and exchange ideas, I guarantee that new discoveries will be made."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend must also know the difficulty of studying True Immortal scripts. If we can complement each other's weaknesses..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's persuasion was eloquent. Li Fan slowly began to show interest.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, Zhong Daogong delivered a powerful blow: "In my homeland, there is also a True Immortal script artifact. If our exchange is pleasant, perhaps we can even allow Daoist friend to witness it firsthand..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong was very clear about the immense temptation that a True Immortal script artifact held for people like them. Therefore, after speaking, he stared intently at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, Li Fan's eyes lit up, and his hesitation disappeared. "Is what you say true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon receiving Zhong Daogong's affirmative reply, Li Fan finally nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, for our first exchange, let's do it here in the void," Li Fan suddenly added.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a casual wave of his hand, silver-white lines interweaved, and a great array gradually unfolded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the great array, pavilions and towers rose, and bridges over flowing water were nestled among them. Clear springs flowed beneath the bridges, shimmering with light. Fish could even be seen swimming playfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Light and shadow shifted, creating an illusion that was as real as reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected, this pavilion and flowing water scene was conjured instantly by the great array!" Zhong Daogong observed his surroundings, vaguely sensing that this seemed to be merely a formation for constructing buildings in the Star Sea. However, its ability to create such an illusion, making even him unable to distinguish between reality and deception, undoubtedly indicated its extraordinary nature.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's merely a trivial skill," Li Fan said nonchalantly. "Studying True Immortal scripts has already exhausted all my efforts. How could I have the energy to study formations..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong nodded in agreement, believing him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After observing the surroundings within the great array and finding no anomalies, Zhong Daogong cupped his hands and said, "Then it's settled. Daoist friend, please wait here. Before this incense burns out, I will definitely return with my companions."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Zhong Daogong spoke, he waved his large sleeve, and a clump of earthy yellow incense flew out from his sleeve and stood in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The flame had already ignited, and smoke curled upwards. Zhong Daogong bowed, bid farewell, and his figure vanished into the dark Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gazed into the distance for a long time before finally returning to Yin Shangren and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Master..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's sudden departure and prolonged absence naturally made Yin Shangren and the others realize that they must have encountered trouble. Now that Li Fan had reappeared, they asked with concern.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I never imagined that there were still surviving civilizations in this frontier of the Star Sea. It must have been disturbed when I set up the formation to connect to the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Fan said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His words were earth-shattering, and everyone was stunned. "Here? It's all dead silence. Where do they live?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'm not sure yet, we only had a brief encounter. However, given that they could survive the destruction of the Star Sea, these people are certainly not to be underestimated. You all should remain hidden for now. Wait for me to investigate thoroughly before we proceed." Li Fan instructed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unknown entities in the Star Sea were more likely to be enemies than friends. Caution was never excessive.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Taking advantage of the time before the Immortal Boat group arrived, Li Fan continued to lecture Yin Shangren and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Relics contain True Immortal remnants, and so do world fragments. If we were to allow the Xuanhuang Realm to absorb world fragments filled with True Immortal remnants..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It might cause world turmoil and lead to the devastation of all living beings."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, so many years have passed since the Great Calamity of the Star Sea. There must be some remnant realms whose True Immortal power has mostly dissipated. Only such realms can serve as medicinal ingredients." Li Fan spoke eloquently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With so many of us working separately, it shouldn't be difficult to find suitable medicinal ingredients, looking at the continuous chain of remnant realms in the Remnant Realm Great Wall," Qiao Gong said, gazing at the distant Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a flick of his finger, the Wooden Sword phantom instantly appeared at the edge of the Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You might as well go out and try." Li Fan said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong was the first to leave the scope of the Wooden Sword phantom's protection. The moment he stepped outside, his expression changed drastically. He felt like he was being pulled by a massive suction force, uncontrollably drawn towards the Remnant Realm Great Wall!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Stabilize!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A golden armor appeared on his body. Qiao Gong struggled frantically, and with great effort, he managed to stabilize himself in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he still could not resist the tendency to move towards the Remnant Realm Great Wall. The light of his armor flickered continuously, seemingly reaching its limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan manipulated the Wooden Sword phantom to envelop Qiao Gong once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Freed from the terrifying suction, Qiao Gong looked at the Remnant Realm Great Wall before him with lingering fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's an Immortal Ruins here too?!" Everyone was shocked beyond words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not an Immortal Ruins. It's the High Wall," Li Fan said slowly, his tone ethereal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The suction force from the Immortal Ruins is blocked by the High Wall at the Star Sea frontier. Then, through means we cannot comprehend, it gathers beneath the High Wall. Over time, it has formed this anomaly."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The reason the world fragments are connected is also to resist this [Echoing Star Power]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene Li Fan painted deeply shocked everyone present.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even without seeing the invisible High Wall, the fact that it could contain the suction force that destroyed the entire Star Sea proved its power and mystery.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Acting near the Remnant Realm Great Wall will not be much less dangerous than being near the Xuanhuang Realm's border. A slight misstep could lead to losing control and crashing into a remnant realm. If there are still True Immortal remnants within..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Also, influenced by the Echoing Star Power, the range of our divine sense exploration is greatly reduced. This is the difficulty in finding medicinal ingredients and suitable remnant realms to fill them," Li Fan said with a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan extended his hand, and a crystal like a silk ribbon, shimmering with seven colors, appeared in his palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is [Empty Clarity Flowing Crystal]. Coupled with the [Splitting Light and Melting Rainbow] technique, it can resist this pervasive suction force to some extent."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Remember, do not push yourselves too hard. When the remaining Hong light is only one-third, you can leave in advance."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan imparted the Empty Clarity Flowing Crystal and the Splitting Light and Melting Rainbow technique to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, if you could all reach the realm of 'No Sword, No Self' like me, perhaps you could ignore this Echoing Star Power to some extent." The Wooden Sword phantom flickered, bringing everyone back to a safe area.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Remnant Realm Great Wall contains countless world fragments. It is extremely difficult for me alone to find suitable medicinal ingredients. Therefore, I need your assistance." Li Fan said earnestly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua couldn't help but ask at this moment, "Saint Master, what is your ultimate goal in going to such lengths? Is it merely to aid Xuanhuang's ascension and benefit from it?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gave a faint smile. "Xuanhuang's ascension and escape from the catastrophic crisis. We, nurtured by heaven and earth, might have the chance to break through the mortal limit. It is a win-win situation, is it not enough?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the others wanted to ask further questions, Li Fan's eyes flickered. "More people are coming. I'll be back shortly."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You all wait here for now and familiarize yourselves with the use of the Splitting Light and Melting Rainbow technique."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before his words finished, Li Fan's figure vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Wooden Sword phantom, everyone fell into a prolonged silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, Xu Ke broke the silence. "Actually, with the Saint Master's strength alone, he could probably facilitate Xuanhuang's ascension. It would just take more time."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, he still brought us 'burdens' along... It reminds me of Mr. Bai back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke sighed emotionally, his eyes filled with endless nostalgia.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, everyone else fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, from their perspective, they truly possessed nothing worthy of the Saint Master's schemes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside the pavilion and tower formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat gathered, observing from a distance without entering.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their divine senses exchanged continuously. "How is it? Is it a trap?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems we were overly concerned. There are indeed no offensive measures; it should just be an illusion formation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it's just a mere formation. How powerful can it be? We have so many people; are we afraid of him alone?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's right. Under the might of True Immortal scripts, what formation would not turn to dust?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't forget, the other party also understands True Immortal scripts. And perhaps even more profoundly than us..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders' communication ceased abruptly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the true form of Li Fan, who had been lecturing on the Dao, emerged from the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He held Zhong Daogong's incense in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The incense had about one-third remaining. Li Fan surveyed everyone and nodded. "As expected, they keep their word."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong introduced everyone: "This is Gan Jingda. This is Nangong Lie..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a round of pleasantries, Li Fan invited everyone into the formation for a detailed discussion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Residing in one of the pavilions, everyone present got straight to the point.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"May I ask how many True Immortal scripts your homeland has deciphered so far?" Zhong Daogong asked directly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This question was crucial. The elders of the Immortal Boat all looked at Li Fan, awaiting his reply.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thirteen," Li Fan said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat exchanged glances. Most wore expressions of disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, it's a few less. However, only those with an accuracy rate above ninety percent are counted," Li Fan added.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, the elders of the Immortal Boat could no longer contain themselves and eagerly asked, "Is what Daoist friend said true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan chuckled, his expression filled with pride. "I never utter falsehoods!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover... there is no need for exaggeration." Li Fan dismissed them with a look of arrogance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, who had been plotting in secret, instantly quelled their intentions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They exchanged glances and whispered amongst themselves, discussing the credibility of Li Fan's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nangong Lie: "One True Immortal script is worth more than all of ours combined? I don't believe such nonsense."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "It's better to believe it than not. The civilization this person belongs to has research capabilities comparable to ours. If they were lucky enough to discover something, acting rashly might cause us to miss this golden opportunity."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi: "Indeed. Possessing True Immortal scripts, it's too difficult to capture them alive. We can only strike swiftly and incapacitate him. In that case, we must extract as much knowledge from his mind as possible before acting."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Regardless of the outcome, this child knows too many secrets of the Immortal Boat. We must not let him leave." This was a consensus already reached by the elders of the Immortal Boat. Therefore, after Zhong Daogong spoke these words, no one objected.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough," Li Fan said arrogantly, posing a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. "Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, "Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, "Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, "What does Daoist friend mean by that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. "In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. "Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. "However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, "To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat," Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fact that the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat sold Immortal Artifacts was known only to a very small number of forces back then. Since this person can mention this matter, it should be true..." Nangong Lie slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the rest?" Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This divine soul trembled. Even more so than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must obtain it at all costs!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. "However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, "To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat," Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fact that the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat sold Immortal Artifacts was known only to a very small number of forces back then. Since this person can mention this matter, it should be true..." Nangong Lie slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the rest?" Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must obtain it at all costs!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough," Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. "Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, "Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, "Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, "What does Daoist friend mean by that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. "In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. "Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them."</p>

If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, "Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, "Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, "What does Daoist friend mean by that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. "In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. "Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. "However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, "To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat," Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fact that the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat sold Immortal Artifacts was known only to a very small number of forces back then. Since this person can mention this matter, it should be true..." Nangong Lie slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the rest?" Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must obtain it at all costs!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough," Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. "Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times.

<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the rest?" Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must obtain it at all costs!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough," Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. "Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, "Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, "Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, "What does Daoist friend mean by that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. "In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. "Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. "However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, "To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat," Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fact that the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat sold Immortal Artifacts was known only to a very small number of forces back then. Since this person can mention this matter, it should be true..." Nangong Lie slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-329" class="calibre1">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!Chapter 1312</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Remnant Realm Great Wall… how can such an anomaly appear at the frontier of the Star Sea?" Qiao Gong exclaimed in disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No wonder worlds that were annihilated back then vanished without a trace. They were all gathered at the foot of the high wall? Remnant realms stretching endlessly, what kind of mighty power could create such a spectacle?" Bai Hua's face was also filled with shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Both of them had survived the destruction of the Star Sea and had witnessed countless cultivation realms turn into desolate lands with their own eyes. Therefore, compared to others, they could more profoundly grasp the awe-inspiring nature of the Remnant Realm Great Wall that stretched as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I seem to..." As if recalling a memory buried deep in his mind, Yin Shangren pressed his forehead, wanting to speak but stopping.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan glanced at him but did not press further. Instead, he solemnly added, "Beyond the Remnant Realm Great Wall, there is another ring of Relic Great Walls serving as a barrier. These two safeguard the high wall, echoing each other and forming an array. The journey ahead is more perilous than going to the center of the Star Sea before. There is even a high possibility of falling to our deaths..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's gaze swept over everyone. "Whether to go or not is entirely up to you to decide."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I will give you half a year to think. Do not blindly pursue higher levels of power. Even if you do nothing from now on, based on the merit of returning Xuanhuang's malevolent thoughts, you will still receive enough benefits when the Xuanhuang Realm completes its ascension." As Li Fan spoke, his figure slowly disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong and the others had varied expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, the moment they saw the spectacle of the Remnant Realm Great Wall, their hearts were shaken, and the desire to witness it firsthand arose. However, Li Fan's words served as a reminder.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In this Star Sea, wonders often came with great power. Great power, therefore, meant danger.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Remnant Realm Great Wall was like this, and so was the Immortal Ruins.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, only three or four fragments of remnant realms were needed as medicinal ingredients to stimulate the Xuanhuang Realm's swallowing and digestion capabilities. It was not necessary for everyone to go.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If this trip goes smoothly, there will be plenty of opportunities to contribute to the Xuanhuang Realm's ascension in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With these thoughts, everyone began to calculate in their hearts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, of course, saw the subtle changes in their expressions. Through his many reincarnations, Li Fan understood the personalities of these people very well. He could guess their general thoughts at a glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Seeking the Dao is the innate instinct of cultivators. However, this path is fraught with danger and hardship. Fear and hatred in one's heart are even greater obstacles to moving forward."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How difficult it is to touch upon the so-called 'Dao'..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching the choices of Qiao Gong and the others when faced with life and death and the pursuit of Dao, wisps of enlightenment inevitably arose in Li Fan's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Waiting for the Heavenly Immortal Souls of the Super Xuanhuang Realm to merge with the Dao did not mean that Li Fan's cultivation would stagnate before then.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Breathing, speaking, acting&mdash;all are cultivation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The thoughts of all sentient beings are like Dao scriptures."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Dao Platform, in the Great Profound Realm, the intentions and thoughts of countless beings poured into Li Fan's mind, one after another, and were perceived by him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They transformed into the power that propelled the giant wheel of Li Fan's cultivation forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This life, he would be the Teacher of Heaven and Earth, not on a whim.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In his previous life, the Saint Emperor, while lecturing, mentioned the concept of "Thundering Dao Longevity." The reverse projection of the Dao could reveal the true meaning of Thundering Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Through multiple attempts at "False becomes True," Li Fan had vaguely confirmed the conjecture of the loli regarding the Saint Emperor's new law.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The projection of the Great Dao from top to bottom formed the myriad realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything that existed in the Xuanhuang Realm, both material and conscious, could be seen as a projection of the Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it was the very end of the projection, and tracing the Dao of the projection from bottom to top was an almost impossible task.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But as the only surviving land in the Star Sea, the Xuanhuang Realm had gathered too many impossibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like the Eternal Relics, which resonated with the Dao, were peculiar existences.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In his previous life, Li Fan had gone to the Tianyang Cave Mansion in the Sea of Clouds. He had collected the Tianyang remains containing Eternal Relics.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He had tried various methods but could never sense the resonance of the Dao within.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan would not give up researching the resonance of the Dao because of this. Instead, he turned to find lower-level substitutes for the Eternal Relics.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the 119th life, Li Fan used the faceless True Immortal statue as a guide and created the Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal Net. Among the countless believers, only Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi's intentions were the most dazzling and special.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even within the Essence of Origin, they were extremely conspicuous.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They were undoubtedly "Seekers of Dao with Utmost Sincerity."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Previously, Li Fan thought this was merely due to their innate character. For Li Fan himself, it had no other benefit. But now, Li Fan discovered that the utmost sincere pursuit of Dao by Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi might be the seed of Eternal Relics.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, if they were guided to continuously deepen their pursuit of Dao. After Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi died, perhaps by chance, "Eternal Relics" would be born.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I cannot utilize Eternal Relics, but can I not use lower-level substitutes?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This discovery from Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi inspired Li Fan. Coupled with the need to merge with the Heavenly Immortal Souls of the Super Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan coincidentally became the "Teacher of Heaven and Earth" in this life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Dao Platform, gathering the intentions of myriad beings. Like stars in the sky, each shining with a different brightness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Some were exceptional, and Li Fan would pay special attention to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, he had not yet found anyone who could ascend to Eternal Relics.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan believed that with the Dao Platform eventually expanding to encompass the entire Xuanhuang Realm, besides Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, he should be able to find others.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, with their current experience, they were still far from being the paramount Seekers of Dao they once were. Taking them as disciples would instead hinder their pursuit of Dao. Therefore, Li Fan did not act on them for the time being, and even added some difficulty to their cultivation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He would wait for the flowers to bloom and bear fruit in the future before harvesting them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Dao projects itself onto the myriad realms, and the beings within the worlds can always correspond to the traces of the Dao."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"These are materials I can use to increase my comprehension of the 'Transformation between True and False'."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having personally experienced the power of "False becomes True," Li Fan had decided to prioritize promoting this matter to the second highest level. Second only to safeguarding his life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for realm, cultivation, and treasures.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These were things that could be obtained in every reincarnation, and could not be compared to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it is said that these brilliant sentient thoughts should be like Eternal Relics; one can only enlighten them once. I wonder how many people in the entire Xuanhuang Realm can surprise me."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's divine sense swept across the land, gazing at the Great Profound citizens who were still continuously arriving at the central Dao Platform. Li Fan nodded slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His figure flickered, and in the next moment, Li Fan had already left the Great Profound Minor World.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He arrived at the Qiling Prefecture of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A vast underground space, filled with an invisible, eerie aura.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with Li Fan's current cultivation, he still had to gather enough Essence of Origin for protection before daring to enter this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Golden threads of Dao formed a protective formation, separating Li Fan from the terrifying power within this underground space.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As I guessed. This Ancient Immortal-Miasma has also undergone a transformation and sublimation along with the Xuanhuang Realm," Li Fan concluded after careful observation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the 119th life, an earthquake occurred in Qiling Prefecture. The Ancient Immortal-Miasma sealed here leaked out, causing a bloodbath. Accumulated in the underground space for thousands of years, this Ancient Immortal-Miasma seemed to have undergone some change, becoming even more potent than its original version.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal-Miasma was created by Mr. Bai against the principles of heaven and earth. It was also a part of the principles of heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that the Xuanhuang Realm was beginning to evolve into a Super Xuanhuang Realm, the Ancient Immortal-Miasma in this underground space was also accumulating power for transformation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mortals can also slay immortals..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan reached out his hand, and the golden protective formation opened. An invisible force seized the opportunity and began to erode Li Fan's palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His brow furrowed. After sensing for just a moment, Li Fan decisively severed his entire arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the Essence of Origin reapplied its protection, blocking the erosion of the Immortal-Miasma.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Interesting."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the time it took to breathe, Li Fan's severed arm had already regrown.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the arm that had remained in the Ancient Immortal-Miasma, it had been completely gnawed away by the surrounding invisible forces.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not even bones were left, only a pile of sand-like residue.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A rare trace of excitement flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Among his bound items for "Return to Reality," there was one called [Ten Thousand Man Essence Blood].</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was refined from tens of thousands of condemned prisoners.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the Immortal-Miasma power contained within this Ten Thousand Man Essence Blood was inferior to even a single wisp of this enhanced Ancient Immortal-Miasma.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the Xuanhuang Realm completes its final transformation, how potent will the Immortal-Miasma here eventually become?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In Li Fan's deductions, the power of the Star Sea's resurgence, the legacy Immortal Spiritual Power of the Great Heavenly Venerates, and the remnants of power from the scattered realms in the Star Sea...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All these forces, pushing together, were enough to elevate the Xuanhuang Realm to a level infinitely close to the Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Or, in a sense, this Super Xuanhuang Realm was the newly ascended Immortal Realm. It was just slightly weaker than the ancient Immortal Realm that had already been destroyed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, even if I cannot slay immortals, I might be able to heavily injure them."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"More importantly, this Ancient Immortal-Miasma can continuously strengthen itself as the Xuanhuang Realm grows stronger. Its inherent nature of 'Mortals Slaying Immortals' determines its importance."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"One day, when I have the ability to truly elevate the Xuanhuang Realm to the Immortal Realm, this Immortal-Miasma will become a genuine Immortal-Slaying weapon!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this thought, Li Fan's gaze towards the invisible force within this vast space changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From Xuan Tian King's past experiences, and even from some clues obtained from outside the high wall, it could be inferred.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Achieving immortality within the Star Sea might involve unimaginable dangers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And the birth of an Immortal Realm might also attract attention. However, Li Fan was not his main body. Even if a crisis descended, it would give Li Fan ample time for buffer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Was it more difficult to achieve immortality oneself, or to facilitate the ascension of the Xuanhuang Realm into an Immortal Realm?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If one were not a madman, they would undoubtedly choose the latter.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But for Li Fan, the conclusion was the opposite.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The legacy of the Great Heavenly Venerates and the Immortal Spiritual Power of Immortal Artifacts are resources that can be infinitely reused for me."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In addition, there are other materials and powers in the entire Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's thoughts raced rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it's feasible."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just by waiting until the end of this life and seeing how far the Super Xuanhuang Realm, which I orchestrated, has come compared to the legendary Immortal Realm, I will be able to make a conclusion."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The transformation of the Ancient Immortal-Miasma opened Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Xuanhuang Realm, embodied laws were countless.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Xuanhuang Realm ascended, these embodied laws, along with all beings nurtured within it, would transform.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had clearly witnessed this process in his previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is only when most of the Immortal Essence was used for the 'All Things Return to Void' great array. If all the Immortal Essence were fed back to catalyze the Xuanhuang Realm, the resulting Heavenly Immortal Souls would undoubtedly be unprecedentedly powerful..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With this Dao Integration, perhaps I can even master Immortal power," Li Fan deduced secretly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before Li Fan, all cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm, except for the Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate, were draining the essence of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their cultivation and foundations were all built upon the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how they refined the principles of heaven and earth, they could not surpass the upper limit of power that the Xuanhuang Realm could provide.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What Li Fan intended to do was to first maximize the potential of the Xuanhuang Realm, and then proceed with Dao Integration.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, the uncontrolled ascension of the Xuanhuang Realm might even shake the foundation of the Dharma Transmitter..." Li Fan's gaze flickered as he deduced something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was still the same prison analogy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Great Heavenly Venerates of the Xuanhuang Realm were dismantling the prison beams, replacing them, filling them in, and integrating into the prison.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What Li Fan intended to do was to expand the prison.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once its scale was expanded several times, he would then replace it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter had almost complete control over the old prison. But if the prison's area suddenly expanded several times...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He would face the risk of the Xuanhuang Realm falling out of control.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This plan has another benefit."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Based on my understanding of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, as long as I do not reveal my intention to integrate with the Heavenly Immortal Souls, it will not harbor any hostility towards me. In fact, it might even provide secret assistance."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After all, I am helping it achieve sublimation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With the assistance of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, I can successfully deceive the Dharma Transmitter and the Heavenly Physician outside the Star Sea without anyone noticing."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the time they realize something is wrong and want to return, the immortal array I have prepared in advance will be enough to hold them back."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pondered the plan, nodding slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition to improving his own realm, he could also enhance his combat power through external means.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For example: True Immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In his previous life, within the Profound Immortal Boat, Li Fan comprehended five completely new True Immortal scripts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they were not complete True Immortal scripts, but imitations and reconstructions by the cultivators of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They were sufficient to deal with Supreme Beings of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, Li Fan's greatest gain from the True Immortal script in his previous life did not come from the Profound Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It came from the Dharma Derivation Jade.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The True Immortal script in the Dharma Der's memory was different from the purely destructive force that permeated the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's heart stirred, and he flashed to the area above the clouds outside the Dissolution Mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although he only had the cultivation of the Foundation Establishment stage, his spiritual energy was condensed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He used his hand as a brush, and with a wave, it was done.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">An extremely profound character appeared and immediately disintegrated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was because the Foundation Establishment stage cultivation was insufficient to support it to display its full power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But the moment this True Immortal script appeared in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Great Profound Minor World suddenly let out a thunderclap.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There were no dark clouds, yet a rain began to fall, covering the entire minor world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The harsh winter season of the twelfth lunar month gradually turned warm like spring under the nourishment of the rain.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan even sensed wisps of spiritual energy in the world, emerging from nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike the spiritual energy created by the Dao One Worm,</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">this spiritual energy, though weak, was naturally generated by the minor world itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan hovered high in the sky, observing the changes in the Great Profound Minor World as it came to life under the rain.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">What surprised him even more was that the Heavenly Dao consciousness of the Great Profound Minor World seemed to be gestating.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because there was no spiritual energy, the Great Profound had no Heavenly Dao consciousness before. Or rather, its Heavenly Dao consciousness was extremely weak, so weak that even Li Fan</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-330" class="calibre1">Chapter 1316: A Sword Across the Star Sea</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not truly that the flow of time had changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rather, the Xuanhuang world surrounding the Boundless Mirror had expanded its rate of evolution countless times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if its acceleration button had been pressed, in the span of a single breath, light and shadow flickered tens of millions of times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ancient Boundless Mirror visibly grew more weathered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One could even clearly see tiny, dust-like gray particles flying out from the Boundless Mirror, carried away by the wind, and then dissipating into the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A divine sense had remained almost an entire lifetime within the Boundless Mirror. Li Fan understood it better than its original spirit, Ling Sun Luyao. Therefore, he could discern the changes occurring to the Boundless Mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the process of Xuanhuang world digestion..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the shell of the Boundless Mirror gradually dissolved, the power of the deduction laws contained within it remained. It was obvious that the energy level of an immortal artifact was still above the current Xuanhuang Realm. Therefore, Xuanhuang Realm did not have the ability to fully digest it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Time continued to evolve at a rate of tens of millions of times. The ancient Boundless Mirror began to decay, being eroded until only the mirror surface remained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, it completely dissolved, leaving behind only a phantom, quietly floating in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if sensing the power of this dispersed immortal artifact law, Xuanhuang Realm underwent an inexplicable change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although this change was almost formless, with Li Fan's current strength and understanding of the Xuanhuang Realm, he could clearly see everything happening before his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A transparent human figure approached the phantom of the Boundless Mirror. The power of countless years of time and the changing of seas and lands seemed to have no effect on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The transparent figure floated closer and gradually overlapped with the phantom, as if swallowing the Boundless Mirror into its belly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, like ripples on the surface of water, the human figure slowly merged into the Xuanhuang world and disappeared from Li Fan's sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From beginning to end, this human figure did not even glance at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if taking away the power of the Boundless Mirror's law was the only thing it cared about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Soul of Heaven and Earth, a type I've never seen before."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And unlike all other Souls of Heaven and Earth, cultivators who see it have no greedy desire to devour it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan retracted his World-Ending Transformation divine ability and peered into the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He seemed to see that at this very moment, in some corner of the Xuanhuang Realm, the transparent human figure was possessing a newborn infant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the infant grew, a new Boundless Mirror would be born. However, it would no longer be an immortal artifact, but a wonder of the Xuanhuang world!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Normally, the Xuanhuang Realm would take thousands or even tens of thousands of years to complete the entire process of digestion and transformation. But with the blessing of Li Fan's World-Ending Transformation, this process was completed in less than half a day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Logically speaking, helping the Xuanhuang Realm digest and absorb an immortal artifact should have resulted in a slight increase in goodwill. However, Li Fan waited for a while but still did not detect any increase in the Xuanhuang Realm's goodwill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After pondering for a moment, Li Fan understood. The Transformation of Seas and Lands was, in essence, a consumption of "lifespan" for the Xuanhuang Realm. One step forward, one step back, it was a wash.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not actually care about this. After all, the growth in the Xuanhuang Realm's strength was tangible. Every bit of growth in the Xuanhuang Realm's power would be synchronized to the future Xuanhuang Immortal Soul. And he would forever be the ultimate beneficiary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He withdrew his gaze, and Li Fan vaguely sensed that as the power of the Boundless Mirror's law integrated into the Xuanhuang Realm. A qualitative change, from nothingness to existence, was brewing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Dao of deduction from the Boundless Mirror does not currently exist in the Xuanhuang Realm. Once the Xuanhuang Realm swallows it and makes it its own..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Heavenly Dao capable of foreseeing the future, how interesting."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Heavenly Dao should have recorded most of the past and present events within the Xuanhuang Realm. With sufficient information, the accuracy of predicting the future might even surpass that of the Boundless Mirror at its peak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the highest realm of deduction mentioned in the Taiyan Sect's [Nine Scrolls of Heaven Deduction], using heavenly calculations instead of human calculations."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Devouring immortal artifacts, for the Xuanhuang Realm, is not just an increase in power. It is more about the completion of laws. With each immortal artifact devoured, it gets one step closer to the true Immortal Realm." Threads of enlightenment suddenly surged in Li Fan's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Great Profound Dao Discussion Platform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren, Bai Hua, Qiao Gong, and Xu Ke had already arrived, all waiting for Li Fan's arrival.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The determination to seek the Dao had ultimately overcome the fear of unknown risks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The last time we traveled to the center of the Star Sea, it took us nearly a month and a half. This time, going to the foot of the high wall, I wonder how long it will take," Qiao Gong sighed with emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Saint Master said that the frontier of the Star Sea is even more dangerous. Perhaps taking several years to return is normal," Bai Hua frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren smiled. "Let's think on the bright side. Perhaps we'll encounter some disaster along the way and never return?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong and Bai Hua were speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the few were discussing, Li Fan's figure appeared on the Dao Discussion Platform at this moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without immediately leading them out, he sat solemnly on the platform and began to expound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, what Li Fan was teaching was "The Way of the Sword."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are three types of swordsmen in the world."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The lowest: forge their will with resilient iron, temper their bodies with sharp weapons. They refine their hearts in the sword, their bodies and sword becoming one. They wield the sword to vanquish enemies, their bodies and sword united."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Above that: the sword in hand is the sword in the heart; the sword in the heart can transform into the sword in hand. Whatever the mind conceives, all things in the world can become a sword."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The highest: the realm of 'No Sword, No Self'."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the initial overview of the three levels, Li Fan began to explain each level in detail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Below the Dao Discussion Platform, everyone listened and gradually became engrossed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even Qiao Gong and the other three were captivated by Li Fan's lecture and temporarily forgot their mission to travel to the frontier of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan's lecture deepened, various auspicious phenomena appeared in the sky. Ignoring the ones that appeared regularly during each lecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The most eye-catching was the countless swords flying from all over the Great Profound, arriving as if summoned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they were all ordinary mortal iron swords, they could now fly through the air. As if paying homage to a king or a sage, they stopped in the air, their sword bodies slightly bowed, performing a slight salute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">More and more swords gathered, obscuring the sky and sun, forming a forest of swords above the Dao Discussion Platform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tens of thousands of swords stood silently, as if also listening to Li Fan's sermon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Holding no sword in hand, nor in the heart; form is not revealed, yet intent always remains..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Li Fan uttered his last words after seven days,</p>
<p class="calibre2">All the flying swords erupted in dazzling light in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the sword light dissipated, the cultivators on the Dao Discussion Platform were shocked to discover that all the flying swords had vanished!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most cultivators were bewildered, believing that all the flying swords had returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a few cultivators with exceptional comprehension stared blankly at the sky, as if struck by inspiration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No sword, no self, the sword intent remains forever..." Xu Ke muttered to himself, unfolding his palm, and a phantom of a long sword appeared above it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other three exchanged a sharp glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as they were about to discuss, they suddenly heard Li Fan's voice: "The preparations are almost complete, it's time to set off."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Know this, the journey ahead is fraught with unknown dangers, and retreat is not an option." Li Fan confirmed with them one last time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone nodded, indicating their understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sword..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Rise..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A gust of wind blew, and the phantom of the wooden sword, like a giant flying ship, enveloped Yin Shangren and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's figure stood at the tip of the sword, pointing forward into the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding scenery changed dramatically. The world seemed to stretch and distort into countless twisted lines, speeding backward. Then, the light merged and transformed into twisted colors of various hues.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The phantom of the wooden sword isolated Yin Shangren and the others from the strange and chaotic sceneries outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they could feel the wooden sword carrying them rapidly towards the depths of the Star Sea, those inside the phantom of the wooden sword felt no change in their speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside the phantom of the wooden sword, the revealed light suddenly turned dark. The colors faded, leaving only distorted shadows. Yin Shangren's expression changed slightly. "Are we already leaving the influence of the Immortal Ruins?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The response he received was the shocked expressions of the other three.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Didn't you say the path ahead would be fraught with danger?" Qiao Gong's tone was unreadable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They could vaguely sense that the phantom of the wooden sword was charging through the Star Sea, unstoppable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ignoring the hidden perils, it continuously accelerated towards its destination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No sword, no self, no sword, no self..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A sword inherently does not exist in the world. Even the calamity that destroyed the Star Sea can only be helpless against something that does not exist!" Xu Ke's eyes were fixed on the phantom of the wooden sword, becoming brighter and brighter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan's voice rang out again: "Having the courage and conviction to choose to follow me deep into the Star Sea has already proven your courage and faith."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You have all managed to survive until now... unnecessary sacrifices should be avoided as much as possible."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Master..." The four looked at Li Fan's back as he stood at the tip of the sword, their expressions complex.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not concern himself with what the four behind him were thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was currently comprehending this Swordsmanship that had reached its limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten days ago, after helping the Xuanhuang Realm digest the Boundless Mirror, Li Fan had visited the Heavenly Sword Sect ruins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the center of the Sword Tomb, the wooden sword seemed to have become extraordinary due to the transformation of the Xuanhuang Realm in this life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to thousands of years ago when Mr. Bai casually created it, the wooden sword now seemed more profound, perhaps due to the erosion of time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Who knows how many immortal artifacts the Xuanhuang Realm Heavenly Dao has devoured."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps there are some laws within them that have supplemented the Xuanhuang Sword Dao..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had previously encountered and sensed this wooden sword in the Fallen Immortal Realm and the real world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The insights gained each time were different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After personally coming into contact with Immortal Spiritual Power and personally setting up the World-Ending Immortal Array, upon seeing this wooden sword again, Li Fan had new ideas.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The more one knows, the more one sees."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Or rather, the projection of the Sword Dao onto the Xuanhuang Realm has become more vivid."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan comprehended the Dao in the Sword Tomb for seven days, not taking away the black sword from the Sword Tomb, allowing it to continue to be influenced by the wooden sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon returning, he transmitted all his insights onto the Dao Discussion Platform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, it transformed into a divine ability, which, carrying Yin Shangren and the others, rapidly flew towards the frontier of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This phantom of "No Sword, No Self" was not merely a simple Dao of the Sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Li Fan's integration of various experiences, including the "[Transformation between True and False]," the forbidden technique "[Secluded Void Concealment]" taught by the Heavenly Physician, and the Golden Lock Across the Heavens array of the Vast Crossing Star Sea Array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only was its speed extremely fast, but it could also exist between reality and illusion, almost disregarding the residual True Immortal script power along the way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he had not truly reached the realm of transforming the virtual into the real. The phantom of the wooden sword would still be affected by some residual True Immortal power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was just that the phantom of the wooden sword was flying too fast, even exceeding the speed at which the residual True Immortal power could take effect, thus creating the illusion of charging forward unimpeded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the wielder of the sword, Li Fan could clearly sense that the energy maintaining the phantom of the wooden sword was rapidly depleting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If not for his foundation being built on the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heavens and the Xuanhuang World-Ending Transformation, his immensely profound foundation, almost comparable to several cultivation realms combined, would be utterly insufficient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Throughout the entire Xuanhuang Realm, besides the Heavenly Physician, even the longevity cultivators of the Five Elders Council might not be able to unleash this sword." Looking at the rapidly changing space and time of the Star Sea, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a hint of pride.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the enhancement of the wooden sword phantom, a journey that originally took more than half a year was now completed in just two to three days, with the destination appearing in the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon seeing several familiar relics floating in the desolate Star Sea, Li Fan controlled the speed to slow down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is this the Sea of Relics that the Saint Master spoke of?" Qiao Gong squinted, gazing ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It should be the accumulation of items left behind after the destruction of various realms in the ancient cultivation world," Bai Hua recognized some decorative objects among them and introduced them to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren, however, had been silent since arriving here. He occasionally pressed his temples, his expression gloomy and uncertain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The phantom of the wooden sword slowly shuttled through the Sea of Relics. In no time, they had left this area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ahead of everyone, a larger aggregate of ruins suddenly appeared in view.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It almost filled the entire field of vision. Even though they were merely ruins and debris,</p>
<p class="calibre2">The accumulation of countless world corpses still sent shivers down everyone's spines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The phantom of the wooden sword fell into deathly silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the phantom of the wooden sword suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone woke up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They saw Li Fan fly out of the phantom and begin setting up an array in a clear area between the Sea of Relics and the Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Golden lines, as if alive, quickly drew various patterns in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They only shone for a moment before disappearing into the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Various items flew out from Li Fan's body and merged with the great array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At a glance, this array was extraordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone at such close proximity, yet they could not sense the slightest fluctuation of the array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist Yin, what kind of array is this?" Qiao Gong asked in surprise, whispering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren shook his head, his gaze not on Li Fan's array, but occasionally drifting towards the distant Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had no reservations. The array he set up in front of everyone was the Immortal Array he had recently learned from the primordial soul of Ji Yuzhen, a Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Heaven's End, Reachable Within a Thousand Miles!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ji Yuzhen herself did not understand formations. She had only encountered the Heaven's End, Reachable Within a Thousand Miles formation several times under Xuan Tianwang's guidance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But with the assistance of the Ultimate Separation Disc, Li Fan was able to roughly reconstruct it.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-331" class="calibre1">Chapter 1317: True Immortal Power Attracts Enemies</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The array, as its name suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Great Array of Heaven's End, Within Reach, could transform the distance of the heavens' end into the space of mere inches. Once the great array was completed, it would connect the Xuanhuang Realm with the frontier of the Star Sea. Even without the technique of the Wooden Sword in the Sky, one could travel instantly through the great array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed to be a super-distance teleportation formation, but that was not the case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, the residual power of true immortals permeated the area. The Xuanhuang Realm was located at the edge of the Immortal Ruins, subject to endless pulling forces, and even spacetime was subtly distorted. Traveling such a vast distance was uncontrollable. Teleportation was simply impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Great Array of Heaven's End, Within Reach, utilized the most primitive method of travel. It merely shortened the distance between the departure and destination infinitely, allowing one to reach it with a single step.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The entire Great Profound Minor World could not accommodate such a colossal immortal array. Therefore, Li Fan set up the great array in the void outside the Great Profound Minor World in the Xuanhuang Realm, and then laid down a concealment formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And here, at the frontier of the Star Sea, as Li Fan gradually completed the array, an extremely mystical fluctuation instantly descended, about to sweep outwards and spread.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan quickly used a finger gesture, and with another concealment formation, blocked it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden light of the great array dimmed, and a bidirectional passage between the Xuanhuang Realm and the Star Sea frontier was silently born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan hovered in the void, regulating his breathing and recovering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected of an immortal-grade great array. Even with the Ultimate Separation Disc assisting me, setting it up was quite strenuous." The accumulated Origin Force Essence was completely depleted. Li Fan was temporarily in a state of exhaustion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Origin Force Essence, compared to true Immortal Spiritual Power, still has a qualitative gap," Li Fan thought to himself. Within a few breaths, the power within his body became replenished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He sent a trace of his divine sense into the Great Array of Heaven's End, Within Reach, and then activated it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He felt his vision blur, and in the next moment, he was back in the void outside Great Profound, within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then leisurely returned to the phantom of the Wooden Sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have set up a Dharma Transmission Array here. In the future, traveling back and forth will not be so troublesome," Li Fan said casually.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren and the others were all shaken by his words. With their understanding, they naturally knew how extraordinary such a teleportation array spanning the entire Star Sea was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The super-distance teleportation arrays between the various prefectures within the Xuanhuang Realm often required more than ten formation masters working together for more than half a year to complete. Not to mention this grand formation that could connect the Star Sea frontier with the Xuanhuang Realm. Yet, such a formation was completed by a mere gesture from the Saint Master...</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, the four of them were somewhat skeptical.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, when Li Fan invited them to try it out, and they passed through the formation, feeling the familiar aura of the Great Profound Minor World once more, all their doubts vanished, replaced by immense shock and reverence for Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"One formation appears, and the boundless Star Sea becomes a thoroughfare. The Saint Master's methods are truly comparable to a True Immortal," Qiao Gong marveled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This formation, this formation..." Yin Shangren murmured, deeply shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's voice drew them back. "This place will be our transfer and supply station for future explorations."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Whether it's the Sea of Relics or the Remnant Realm Great Wall, their vastness far exceeds that of the Xuanhuang Realm. Finding suitable remnant realms is not an easy task."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong: "May the Saint Master enlighten us, what is the mystery behind this? Isn't it enough to find a remnant realm to serve as Xuanhuang's medicinal catalyst?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled faintly and extended his hand towards the distant Sea of Relics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Swish!</p>
<p class="calibre2">A relic was attracted and flew rapidly towards their location.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Faintly visible, the relic was a blue and white robe. Eroded by time, it was already in tatters. The bloodstains on it had also turned black.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the relic robe flew closer, Qiao Gong and the others' expressions changed in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In their perception, the distance between themselves and their companions was rapidly increasing as the relic robe approached. It was as if the world had suddenly become vast, and their bodies had shrunk countless times. Even their communication became inaudible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"True Immortal Power!" They finally realized that this was the influence of the True Immortal power carried by the relic robe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the robe drew nearer, their distances continued to widen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though standing beside each other, they could not see each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if isolated by the entire world,</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the boundless emptiness, Li Fan's voice resounded from the heavens like peals of thunder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, various realms have been shattered. But the perpetrators of world destruction, from the powers of True Immortal scripts, still pervade and remain."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The various disasters we encountered on our journey to the center of the Star Sea are all manifestations of these residual True Immortal powers."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The continuous relics and remnant realms before us also contain this power."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This robe contains a character: [Separation]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The vision instantly returned to normal. The relic robe also changed its flight direction and flew back into the Sea of Relics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And above everyone's heads, a profound and extremely complex "character" flickered dimly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"True Immortal... script?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone stared blankly at the character above their heads. They could faintly feel the terrifying power contained within.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"[Separation]..." Recalling the experience of being separated from everything around them just now, they used their hands as brushes, attempting to learn and imitate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unexpectedly, the character suddenly dimmed and vanished into the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the memories left in their minds became blurred. No matter how they tried to recall, they could never reproduce it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are too many residual True Immortal powers in the Star Sea. Acting rashly might trigger a resonance with these remnants. To study True Immortal scripts, special methods are needed," Li Fan gently tapped his finger, and a method instantly flew into everyone's minds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the [Myriad Laws] technique that Li Fan had learned from the Profound Immortal Boat in his previous life, a method used to study and teach True Immortal scripts, applicable to the Proof of Dao Academy, Immortal Hub Courtyard, and Severed Immortal Tower.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every True Immortal script was a projection of the power of the Dao. Even if it was only a similar form and not the actual True Immortal script, it contained immense destructive power. If it exploded within the Immortal Boat, it would undoubtedly cause indelible damage. To avoid triggering the power of True Immortal scripts, yet still be able to study them, the Profound Immortal Boat had spent generations of painstaking effort to create this method.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each stroke of the character, and even the process of wielding the brush, had been deliberately modified, appearing similar yet not. The dots were not dots, the horizontals were not horizontals, the strokes were not strokes. When combined, they looked like characters, but were not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the most incompetent imitators. The True Immortal scripts replicated using this method had the form but lacked the essence, reducing the power of the True Immortal scripts by a million times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, the influence of the True Immortal scripts during the research process could be ignored. At the same time, when the true, complete True Immortal script was replicated, the energy fluctuation of the character that had abruptly increased several times could also serve as a good judgment standard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To truly unleash the power of the True Immortal script, all modifications need only be erased when activated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was precisely because of this wonderful method that the Immortal Boat's generations of cultivators had been able to study and inherit True Immortal scripts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Immortal Boat, only by being accepted as a disciple by a ruling elder was one eligible to know this method.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan, without any additional conditions, freely imparted this marvelous method to Yin Shangren and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Both the Myriad Laws technique and the character [Separation] profoundly shocked the few of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If what Li Fan had taught before was still within the realm of the "mortal," then this character [Separation] was undoubtedly a genuine True Immortal power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the current cultivation world, possessing such great power, yet not cherishing it as a treasure, but teaching it to others for free...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of what speculations Yin Shangren and the others had about Li Fan's motives, they were all conquered by his selfless demeanor at this moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"He is worthy of the title 'Saint Master'." They all felt this way in their hearts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's lecture continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using the Myriad Laws technique, Li Fan rewrote the character [Separation] again. He frankly admitted, "I have never seen the character [Separation] itself. I only inferred the origin of the True Immortal script from the residual power contained in the relic, based on the remnant power."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Like a blind person touching an elephant, there are naturally errors. The smaller the error, the more it can reproduce the original power of the True Immortal script. This [Separation] character has been pondered by me to 98% similarity. However, I have not been able to make further progress for a long time." Li Fan said with a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone eagerly gazed at the character Li Fan had written.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They did not slight it just because it was a similar form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While they were studying, subtle fluctuations were transmitted from afar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren and the others did not notice, but Li Fan's eyes flashed with a discerning light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Finally, they're here."</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a wave of his hand, he withdrew the Wooden Sword phantom and the concealment formation of the Great Array of Heaven's End, Within Reach. He himself sped towards the direction of the fluctuating signals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In no time, two figures met head-on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the approaching figures. It was the Great Elder of the Severed Immortal Tower, Zhong Daogong!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's expression was solemn. He looked at Li Fan, a hint of confusion flickering in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had sensed a familiar power fluctuation erupt and then disappear from the Immortal Boat earlier. Thus, he came to investigate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He initially thought it was the residual True Immortal power from a relic erupting, but unexpectedly, the source of the power was a cultivator!</p>
<p class="calibre2">How many years had it been since he had seen a cultivator outside the Immortal Boat?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong did not dare to be careless. "May I ask, Daoist friend, why have you summoned me here...?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, however, chuckled dismissively. "Fellow Daoist, you must have misunderstood. I was merely teaching my disciples True Immortal scripts, and I did not expect to attract your attention."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I never imagined that there were still cultivators alive in this Star Sea frontier?" Li Fan's tone was filled with surprise and curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's eyes narrowed as he sized Li Fan up and pondered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had sensed a familiar power fluctuation erupt and then disappear from the Immortal Boat earlier. Thus, he came to investigate.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong did not dare to be careless. "May I ask, fellow Daoist, why have you summoned me here...?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, however, chuckled dismissively. "Fellow Daoist, you must have misunderstood. I was merely teaching my disciples True Immortal scripts, and I did not expect to attract your attention."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I never imagined that there were still cultivators alive in this Star Sea frontier?" Li Fan's tone was filled with surprise and curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's eyes narrowed as he sized Li Fan up and pondered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He keenly noticed Li Fan's words, "Star Sea frontier." At the same time, Li Fan's explanation about teaching True Immortal scripts also made his heart tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without confirming the other party's intentions, Zhong Daogong did not act directly but continued to probe. "Judging from your words, fellow Daoist, it seems you have come from the depths of the Star Sea? Could it be that within the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, there are still surviving civilizations?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan sighed, "Traveling all this way, all I saw was emptiness. I also thought there were no other survivors in the Star Sea. To think that at the end of my journey, I would encounter a cultivator again..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two exchanged words, probing each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a round of exchanges, Zhong Daogong only knew that the other party had come from the depths of the Star Sea, but he had no idea about the form, scale, or strength of the other party's world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Clearly, this cultivator who could traverse the Star Sea was not a pure and innocent being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong re-examined Li Fan carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unable to discern the other party's background, Zhong Daogong suppressed the urge to act directly and capture him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You mentioned earlier that you were teaching your disciples True Immortal scripts. I wonder..." Zhong Daogong changed the subject, continuing to probe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unexpectedly, Li Fan did not hide this time and said generously, "The Star Sea civilizations have been destroyed, and True Immortal residual powers run rampant. To survive, one must naturally borrow these powers."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"After thousands of years of research, we have achieved some results. Survival is no longer as difficult as it was initially."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words were completely aligned with the philosophy of the Profound Immortal Boat. Zhong Daogong nodded, not refuting him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems that your homeland's research into True Immortal scripts has reached quite a level. To be frank, we have also studied True Immortal powers for thousands of years, but we have not dared to traverse the Star Sea so easily. We have only been confined to one region." Zhong Daogong said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled faintly. "Fellow Daoist, there is no need for modesty. I can sense... on your body..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The scent of True Immortal scripts." Li Fan's tone was unfathomable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's expression changed slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before Zhong Daogong could speak, Li Fan directly used his hand as a brush and wrote a character [Separation].</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, please take a look at this character."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The faintly visible character drifted in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong could no longer hide his shock. He retreated sharply, looking at Li Fan with great caution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Who exactly are you? Why do you know our Profound Immortal Boat's [Myriad Laws]?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"[Myriad Laws]?" Li Fan looked perplexed and then suddenly realized.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You mean, the parallel technique?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This was naturally created by our ancestors through painstaking research to analyze True Immortal scripts."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at Zhong Daogong with great interest. "Could it be that you also know this technique?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only did he know it, but Zhong Daogong's thoughts raced furiously as he tried to find a list of people within the Immortal Boat who had been taught this technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no indication of anyone leaving the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it be mere coincidence?" Zhong Daogong was somewhat unsure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He stared at the character [Separation] that Li Fan had written.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's even further advanced than the Immortal Boat's research?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Discovering this, Zhong Daogong's heart was once again filled with immense shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only because the research on the True Immortal script [Separation] was still ahead of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But also because the other party so easily displayed the incomparably precious True Immortal script to a stranger. One must know that every True Immortal script was an absolute secret within the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even he, as the Great Elder of the Severed Immortal Tower, was not qualified to leak it casually.</p>
<p class="calibre2">" It can only mean that in this person's homeland, the research on True Immortal scripts has already reached a certain height. The character [Separation] is no longer necessary to keep secret." Zhong Daogong couldn't help but think.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A thought arose in Zhong Daogong's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, would you be interested in coming to our place as a guest?" Zhong Daogong asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's expression immediately showed hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong understood Li Fan's hesitation very well, so he frankly said, "If you are still worried, then we can do it here in the Star Sea void."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mainly, I wish to exchange research findings on True Immortal scripts with fellow Daoist in detail."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-332" class="calibre1">Chapter 1318: Transaction Under the High Wall</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Exchanging insights..." Li Fan pondered for a long time, remaining silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing this, Zhong Daogong let out a long breath. Using black and white ink as a brush, he inscribed a character in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Observe, Daoist." Zhong Daogong was extremely solemn. Even in the deserted Star Sea, he laid down restrictions around them to prevent the character’s essence from leaking out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The character flickered between light and dark, undulating like a sentient creature flowing through the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan glanced at it and said casually, "So it is [Abhorrence (憎)]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, your version of [Abhorrence] seems to contain several fallacies."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong’s expression shifted. Before he could speak, Li Fan said proudly, "Observe my version of [Abhorrence]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His brush moved like a dancing dragon and a startled snake. In an instant, another character&mdash;seemingly identical but fundamentally different&mdash;suddenly appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two [Abhorrence] characters stood side-by-side.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong stared at the character Li Fan had written. He froze at first, and then his body began to tremble uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Great Elder of the Severing Immortal Tower (断仙楼) and the scholar with the deepest research into True Immortal Runes within the Profound Immortal Vessel (玄仙舟), Zhong Daogong could clearly distinguish the subtle differences between the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Judging by the fluctuations faintly emanating from the characters, Li Fan’s version was significantly more complete than his own! The degree of refinement far surpassed the previous [Separation (离)] rune!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This... this..." Stunned by consecutive blows, Zhong Daogong found it difficult to accept for a moment. However, his lifelong research instincts took over, causing him to cast aside all distractions and begin contemplating the character Li Fan had provided.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Every detail modified brought it closer to its primordial essence. Had he explored this on his own, it would have taken ten or twenty years of painstaking research to catch up. But here, a single glance was worth countless nights of toil.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong had no way of knowing that this version of [Abhorrence] actually originated from himself several decades into the future. At this moment, he had only one thought: he must "invite" this cultivator back to the Profound Immortal Vessel, even if it meant using force!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">True Immortal Runes were far too important to the vessel. Every new rune understood meant a massive leap in their combat power. Furthermore, the vital plan they were working on required collecting as many different types of True Immortal Runes as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With this in mind, after deeply etching the new [Abhorrence] into his memory, Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan with admiration. "Your level is profound, Daoist. I am far inferior!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However... in my homeland, there are more than ten scholars who research runes like I do. They have delved deep for many years; their collective understanding is not below mine..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head, a flash of disdain in his eyes as he interrupted Zhong Daogong. "To be honest, in my Great Qi (大启)..." Li Fan paused. "Everyone is united in heart and purpose to survive this ruined Star Sea. All research on True Immortal Runes is shared. Conversely, on your side..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong was delighted by this. He explained seriously, "Actually, we have a similar sharing system. But since it involves the research results of others, it is inconvenient for me to display them without review. However, if you are willing to share and exchange, I guarantee there will be new gains."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You surely know how difficult it is to study these runes. If we can complement each other's knowledge..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Under Zhong Daogong’s persuasion, Li Fan slowly seemed to change his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, Zhong Daogong applied a "heavy dose" of temptation: "In my homeland, we also possess a genuine original copy of a True Immortal Rune. If our exchange goes well, it is not impossible for you to see it with your own eyes."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong knew exactly how irresistible an original rune was to people like them. After speaking, he stared intently at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, Li Fan’s eyes lit up, his hesitation vanishing. "Is that true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After receiving Zhong Daogong’s affirmation, Li Fan finally nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, for the first exchange, let us do it here in the void," Li Fan suddenly added.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He gestured toward a nearby area, and silver lines began to interweave. A grand array slowly unfolded. Within the array, pavilions and towers rose from the ground, hidden among small bridges and flowing water. Clear springs flowed beneath the bridges, shimmering with light, and one could even see fish playing in the water.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The light and shadows flickered, appearing as real as a dream.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing this, Zhong Daogong’s pupils constricted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan flew into the array first, sitting in a pavilion by the water. He looked back and said, "This place will do."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As they say, one must have a heart of caution. Coming to the edge of the Star Sea alone, I must naturally be careful." Li Fan spoke as if it were only logical.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong pondered for a moment before flying into the array himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The sound of birds chirping filled his ears. Walking across the bridge, water flowed beneath him. Zhong Daogong could even feel the moist warmth of the air. It was hard to imagine that this scenery was generated in an instant by an array!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I didn't expect that besides runes, you are also an expert in arrays?" Zhong Daogong surveyed the area. He could vaguely tell this was just an array for building structures in the Star Sea, but the fact that it could produce such a "False-is-True" illusion that even he found hard to distinguish spoke volumes of its quality.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just a minor trick," Li Fan said dismissively. "Studying runes has exhausted my heart's blood. How could I have energy for arrays?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong deeply agreed and nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After observing the array and finding nothing suspicious, Zhong Daogong cupped his hands. "Then it is settled. Wait here, Daoist. I will return with the others before this incense burns out."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong waved his sleeve, and a stick of earthy-yellow incense flew out, standing upright in the air. The fire was lit, and thin smoke drifted. Zhong Daogong bid farewell and vanished into the dark Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stared at his departure for a long time before returning to Yin Shangren and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Master..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan’s sudden departure and long absence had worried them. As soon as he appeared, they asked with concern.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I didn't expect a civilization to survive here at the edge of the Star Sea. I likely disturbed them when I set up the array to connect to the Profound Yellow Realm," Li Fan said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This revelation shocked everyone. "Here? In this dead silence? Where do they live?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It’s not yet clear; we’ve only had a brief encounter. However, anyone who survived until now in the ruined Star Sea is certainly not to be trifled with. Do not reveal yourselves for now. Wait until I have gathered more information." Li Fan cautioned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone nodded in agreement. Unknowns in the Star Sea were more likely enemies than friends; one could never be too careful.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Taking advantage of the gap before the Vessel cultivators arrived, Li Fan continued his lecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Relics contain remnants of True Immortal power, and world fragments are no different. If we allow the Profound Yellow Realm to absorb fragments filled with such remnants..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It would likely cause world-wide upheaval and suffering for all living things."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, many years have passed since the Great Calamity. There must be some remnants where the True Immortal power has mostly dissipated. Only these can serve as the 'medicinal primer' (药引子)." Li Fan explained.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With so many of us acting separately, finding a suitable primer shouldn't be too difficult, right?" Qiaogong said, looking at the distant "Long Wall of Remnant Worlds."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He pointed a finger toward the edge of the wall. The wooden sword phantom instantly flashed to the border of the remnant worlds.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You should go out and try for yourselves," Li Fan said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiaogong was the first to leave the protection of the sword phantom.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he reached the outside, his face changed drastically. He felt a massive suction force, as if he were being pulled uncontrollably toward the remnant world wall!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"STAY!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A layer of golden armor appeared on his body. Qiaogong struggled frantically, using considerable effort just to stabilize himself in the void. However, he still couldn't stop the trend of moving toward the wall. The light on his armor flickered, seemingly reaching its limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan steered the sword phantom to envelop Qiaogong once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Freed from the terrifying suction, Qiaogong looked at the wall in terror. "Is there another Immortal Ruins (仙墟) here?!" Everyone was speechless with shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It’s not the Immortal Ruins. It is the High Wall," Li Fan said slowly, his voice ethereal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The suction from the Immortal Ruins is blocked by the High Wall at the edge of the Star Sea. It then gathers under the wall in a way we cannot yet understand. Over the years, it has formed this alternative version of the Ruins."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The reason the world fragments are linked together is precisely to resist this 'Echoing Astral Force' (回荡星力)..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan’s description deeply shocked the group. Even if they couldn't see the invisible High Wall, the fact that it could firmly imprison the suction force of the Immortal Ruins&mdash;which had destroyed the entire Star Sea&mdash;proved its mysterious power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Operating within the Remnant World Wall is no less difficult than dealing with the suction at the borders of the Profound Yellow Realm. A single mistake and you'll lose control, crashing into a remnant world. If there are still rune remnants inside..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, under the influence of the Echoing Astral Force, our divine sense is greatly restricted. This is where the difficulty of finding the 'primer' and suitable filler worlds lies." Li Fan’s tone was deep.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan held out his hand, and a rainbow-colored crystal, like silk, appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is [Clear Void Flowing Crystal (空明流晶)]. Combined with the [Light-Splitting Rainbow Technique (分光化虹之术)], it can help resist this omnipresent suction."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Remember, do not push yourselves. When the rainbow light is down to one-third, leave immediately."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan taught the group the technique and the use of the crystal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, if you can reach the realm of 'No Sword, No Self' as I have, you might be able to ignore this Echoing Astral Force to some extent." The sword phantom flickered, taking them back to a safe zone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are countless fragments in the wall. It would take me forever to find a suitable primer alone, so I need your assistance." Li Fan said seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Baihua couldn't help but ask, "Master, what is it that you truly seek through all these efforts? Is it simply to benefit from the ascension of the Profound Yellow Realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan laughed. "If the realm ascends and escapes the crisis of destruction, we will be nourished by the heavens. We might even have the chance to break the limits of mortality. Isn't that enough?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They wanted to ask more, but Li Fan’s eyes flashed. "More people are coming. I will be right back."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Stay here and familiarize yourselves with the Rainbow Technique."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before his voice faded, Li Fan vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the sword phantom, the group remained silent for a long time. Finally, Xu Ke broke the silence. "Actually, with the Master’s power alone, he could probably force the ascension; it would just take more time."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yet he brings us 'burdens' along... it reminds me of Mr. Bai in the past." Xu Ke sighed, his eyes full of nostalgia.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The others remained silent. Indeed, from their perspective, they didn't seem to possess anything that the Master would need to plot for.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside the Pavilion Array.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Vessel gathered. They did not enter, observing from a distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their divine senses communicated rapidly: "What do you think? Is it a trap?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems we worried too much. There are indeed no offensive means; it should just be an illusion array."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's just an array. How strong can it be? There are so many of us; why fear a single man?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Correct. Under the power of True Immortal Runes, any array will turn to ash."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't forget, the opponent also understands runes. He might even be deeper into it than we are..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders' communication suddenly stalled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Li Fan, whom they had been waiting for, stepped slowly out of the array. He held the incense stick Zhong Daogong had left behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One-third of the incense remained. Li Fan surveyed the crowd and nodded. "You are men of your word."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong introduced the others: "This is Gan Jingda. This is Nangong Lie..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After some pleasantries, Li Fan invited them into the array to talk. The Vessel elders looked at each other and finally agreed, entering the array together.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Entering one of the pavilions, they went straight to the point.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist, how many True Immortal Runes has your homeland successfully analyzed so far?" Zhong Daogong asked. This was the key question; everyone stared at Li Fan, waiting for his answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thirteen," Li Fan said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Vessel elders looked at each other, most showing expressions of doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is few, of course," Li Fan added. "But only those with a completion rate of over 90% are counted."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders could no longer contain themselves and asked urgently, "Are you telling the truth?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan laughed, looking proud. Zhong Daogong gestured for the elders to calm down.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It’s not that we don’t believe you. But thirteen runes... and at 90% completion..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is truly hard to believe." Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled and said directly, "We can trade. One rune for one rune."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders communicated once more and reached a consensus.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have already shown [Separation] and [Abhorrence]. This time, it’s your turn first." Li Fan looked at the Vessel elders, his voice resonant.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though he was surrounded by a crowd, there wasn't a trace of fear on his face.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-333" class="calibre1">Chapter 1319: The Shortcut to Proving the Way</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing Li Fan's request, the elders of the Immortal Boat found nothing inappropriate. However, they also presented their own demands: "True Immortal script characters are absolute secrets of the Immortal Boat. Although this place is in the deserted depths of the Star Sea, we must guard against eavesdropping and prying eyes."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, we must also set up an array here!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled, "As you wish. If you find setting up the formation strenuous, I can also help."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat coldly snorted and paid no attention to Li Fan's teasing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Joining forces, they set up another layer of formation within the "Illusion Formation" Li Fan had laid out. After finally feeling assured that everything was foolproof, they began the formal exchange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am Jian Daosheng, please enlighten me!" Without unnecessary pleasantries, Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard of the Immortal Boat, solemnly wrote a True Immortal script character on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps to suppress Li Fan's arrogance and gain the upper hand, the True Immortal script character he chose this time was indeed not simple. Li Fan had never had the opportunity to come into contact with it during his studies with the Immortal Boat in his previous life, even when he later became Ai Tianjue's disciple and was almost a core member of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dark lines slowly drifted in the void. The moment the character was fully formed, it was as if a great sun illuminated the dark Star Sea where Li Fan and the Immortal Boat elders were located.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This True Immortal script character brought not only a change in light and darkness. Under the light, it actually brought a hint of vitality to the dead and silent Utmost Darkness Star Sea!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A True Immortal script with a positive effect?" Li Fan's heart stirred, and his expression immediately turned serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ignoring Jian Daosheng's rather proud demeanor, he focused solely on the True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Li Fan's current knowledge, especially after glimpsing the mysterious characters of "Creation" and the one that created the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate's bloodline, his ability to decipher True Immortal script characters was almost unparalleled in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Carefully observing the character that occasionally moved and changed, yet remained like a high-hanging sun, it only took the time it takes for a cup of tea for the original meaning of the True Immortal script character represented by this character to appear in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">[ sunrise ].</p>
<p class="calibre2">The myriad phenomena of the sun rising, vital energy circulating, and all things reviving... collectively formed this special True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So that's how it is."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After completing the deciphering of the [sunrise] character, Li Fan also resolved a long-standing question in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How did the Profound Immortal Boat survive the destruction of the Star Sea to this day?</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, Li Fan thought it was the Immortal Boat Divine Tree formed by the Seed of Life. But after staying in the Immortal Boat for several years, he gradually discovered something was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat Divine Tree needed to continuously absorb strange objects like the Dao-Confronting Giant and the Human Emperor Rabbit to provide sufficient energy for the Immortal Boat. This indicated that the Divine Tree itself was insufficient to offset the energy consumption of the Immortal Boat's normal operation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the past nearly ten thousand years, the Divine Tree was not always absorbing external energy. What guaranteed the lush growth of the Divine Tree during this blank period?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the environment within the Immortal Boat, which was as vibrant and warm as a normal cultivation world, did not seem to be something that a mere otherworldly Divine Tree could provide. Let alone anything else, even the本体 of the Immortal Boat Divine Tree, the Otherworldly Divine Tree of the Xuanhuang Realm's Divine Tree Sect, did not possess such miraculous abilities back then.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today, with the appearance of this [sunrise] character, the mystery was finally solved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was precisely this True Immortal script character representing the phenomenon of sunrise that had provided the Immortal Boat with a suitable living environment for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the foundation of the Profound Immortal Boat's survival, an undeniable treasure. These people from the Immortal Boat actually took it out first..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems they don't intend to let me leave?" Li Fan was very familiar with the temperaments of these elders from his time in the Immortal Boat in his previous life. They valued the True Immortal script characters and the future of the Immortal Boat more than their own lives. Yet, they are now imparting the ultimate secret that determines the future of the Immortal Boat...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if it was "one character exchanged for one character," it seemed extremely suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Unfortunately, your plan is destined to be in vain. You can act as a nuisance, but to keep me... Hmph!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The formation jointly laid out by the elders of the Immortal Boat, in Li Fan's eyes, was like a child's play, full of loopholes. Moreover, with the peerless escape technique he now possessed, even if a True Immortal descended, he was eighty percent confident he could escape calmly. Naturally, he was not afraid of the siege by the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pretending to be unaware of their scheme, Li Fan continued to focus on deciphering the [sunrise] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his research deepened, he discovered something was amiss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The [sunrise] character indeed represented the phenomenon of newborn sun. The morning sun was gentle, but that was from the perspective of the Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For beings in the lower realms, the gentle sunlight from the Immortal Realm's morning sun was not something they could withstand. If the [sunrise] character descended, it would not bring vitality. Instead, it would instantly burn the world into a hellscape!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So, this is not a True Immortal script character with positive effects either. It still represents destruction and chaos. It's just that the people of the Immortal Boat have weakened the completeness of the True Immortal script character and reduced its power, thus turning harm into benefit."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brilliant, worthy of a force that has survived the Great Tribulation. They truly have some tricks up their sleeves." Li Fan praised inwardly. However, his face changed drastically, and he glared at the elders of the Immortal Boat, "Is this not right?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This [sunrise] character's completeness is not even ninety percent! Are you trying to deceive me?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan appeared furious, then full of disappointment. "Forget it. I didn't expect you to be such untrustworthy people. The exchange is canceled!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were surprised that Li Fan could see through the weakness of the [sunrise] character so quickly. While shocked, Jian Daosheng quickly explained to Li Fan, "Fellow Daoist, you misunderstand! It's not that I deliberately hid it. In fact, for our lower realm, the [sunrise] character with thirty percent completeness is more useful than one with higher completeness!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, if Fellow Daoist insists, displaying the complete [sunrise] character is also fine."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After speaking, Jian Daosheng wrote the [sunrise] character again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the [All Laws] greatly reduced the power of the True Immortal script character, Li Fan could still feel the suffocating heat waves that instantly replaced the warmth around him the moment the character took shape. Vitality vanished in an instant, turning into a grim killing intent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan recorded the complete [sunrise] character, then said, "Alright, I must admit, you are right."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since it was a misunderstanding, let the exchange continue!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing Li Fan's words, the elders of the Immortal Boat secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan coughed lightly, drawing everyone's attention. "Everyone, watch closely!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">With swift and elegant strokes, the [Fall] character was written instantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the [Fall] character appeared, the expressions of the elders of the Immortal Boat became somewhat subtle. Especially Ai Tianjue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He stared blankly at the character in the void ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He probably never imagined that the True Immortal script character he had researched the most would be written by the other party first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The completeness has far exceeded the current progress of the Immortal Boat, likely approaching ninety percent. This..." Ai Tianjue couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, Ai Tianjue didn't know that the [Fall] character Li Fan wrote at this moment had not reached ninety percent completeness. Following the teachings of Ai Tianjue from decades later in his previous life, Li Fan's deciphering of the [Fall] character was only around eighty percent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan combined his understanding of "Creation" and the mysterious character that represented the transformation between Immortals and mortals, and even incorporated a trace of the "Transformation between True and False." He reorganized and modified the [Fall] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Infused with a deeper aura of power, Li Fan's written [Fall] character looked even more "advanced." It was even more like the original [Fall] character than the original [Fall] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had no confidence before whether he could deceive the elders of the Immortal Boat with such a method. However, judging from their expressions now, it was definitely feasible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, he sneered inwardly, feeling even more confident about the smooth progress of his plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Elders, what do you think of this [Fall] character?" Li Fan asked loudly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they desperately wanted to say that this [Fall] character overlapped with the Immortal Boat's research, they were inferior to the other party in research progress. And in a short period, the elders of the Immortal Boat would not be able to elevate their understanding of the [Fall] character to Li Fan's level.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat looked at each other and deliberated. Finally, they decided to accept this loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, it was the Immortal Boat's turn to act again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi of the Severed Immortal Tower wrote the True Immortal script character [Lone].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Li Fan's research on this True Immortal script character was still ahead of the Immortal Boat's, for the sake of "casting a long line to catch a big fish," Li Fan did not go too far.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He pretended to mutter, "[Lone] is a character not uncommon in the Star Sea. However, our research progress is indeed not as good as yours."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands, "I have learned from you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, the Immortal Boat elders breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, exchanges so far had resulted in significant losses for the Immortal Boat. This reversal of the situation was a good start.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Li Fan's turn. The [Suppress] character appeared in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This [Suppress] character was also derived from the research of the Immortal Boat. However, the deciphering progress had not even reached one-third, and it was completely unsystematic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In his previous life, Li Fan had passed on thisincomplete [Suppress] character to Sun Tianci. With his extraordinary comprehension, he had completed further derivations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this life, adding his own understanding and reconstructing it, Li Fan completed the fabrication.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Similarly, he intended to test the level of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The result...</p>
<p class="calibre2">After deliberation by Zhong Daogong and others, they approved the True Immortal script character provided by Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan remained silent on the surface, but inwardly he understood: "It seems the Profound Immortal Boat has not encountered any True Immortal script characters of the [Creation] level."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Imitating and replicating from top to bottom is truly not something they can see through in a short time."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, with time, they might notice some clues..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan mused inwardly, and the Immortal Boat then presented a new True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the character appeared, both the formation jointly laid out by the Immortal Boat and Li Fan's "Illusion Formation" trembled slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As an absolute master of formations, Li Fan keenly sensed that under the influence of this new True Immortal script character, the very finest units maintaining the formation structure were beginning to disintegrate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was instantly startled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, the formation he had casually laid out was by no means a simple illusion formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a pseudo-immortal formation that integrated downscaled versions of two immortal-grade formations, "[Desolation, Empty Chamber Sprouts Flowers]" and "[Immortal Descent, Myriad Things Return to Void]!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">It hid killing intent in the unseen, capable of silently killing all enemies who entered the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even such a formation was damaged to its foundation by a weakened True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the power of this True Immortal script character were fully displayed, my pseudo-immortal formation would likely be shattered in an instant." As formations were Li Fan's most important trump card, his heart became incomparably solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While re-repairing the gradually collapsing formation, he also studied this newly appeared True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Undoubtedly, it is a formation-specialized character."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With this True Immortal script character, it is no wonder the Immortal Boat's formation level is so low."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is hard to say whether the Immortal Boat showing me this character has any intention of showing off."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Learning this character makes this trip worthwhile." Li Fan was very satisfied with this exchange of True Immortal script characters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, he gradually deciphered the true meaning of the character before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">[Dissolve].</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he comprehended the original true meaning of the True Immortal script character, Li Fan thought of his treasure, the Ultimate Separation Disc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, my Separation Disc now, like the Dharma Derivation Jade, can be considered a part of the Great Dao's projection from bottom to top."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, I can try to glimpse the Dao of [Dissolve] through the Separation Disc."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the number of True Immortal script characters he mastered increased, Li Fan gradually discovered that what was powerful was not the True Immortal script characters themselves, but the Great Dao indicated by the True Immortal script characters themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The True Immortal script characters were merely shortcuts and tools to help ordinary people, and even ordinary immortals, to touch upon the Great Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Similarly, world wonders and eternal remnants are also similar shortcut tools."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Their essence is actually interconnected."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao Inscription Immortal."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly thought of this nameless True Immortal, who was said to have inscribed myriad Dao paths, making them more "approachable."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao paths cannot be cultivated together. Yet this Dao Inscription Immortal can know so much about the myriad Great Daos..." It was truly beyond Li Fan's current imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's fleeting thoughts did not affect the True Immortal script exchange meeting in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using characters like [Chaos], [Non-existence], and [Nothingness], along with the [Xuān] character he learned from the Immortal Boat in his previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nearly emptied the Immortal Boat's research foundation on True Immortal script characters over several thousand years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, [Chaos], [Non-existence], and others were not the complete versions he saw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were weakened versions modified slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides [sunrise] and [dissolve],</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan learned two more characters: [Cold] and [Loss].</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point, both sides had almost exhausted their reserves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The atmosphere in the venue gradually became subtle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan spoke first, slightly breaking the stalemate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I must admit that your research on True Immortal script characters is indeed not inferior to ours in Great Qi."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I never imagined that there would still be a surviving civilization within the Star Sea that could rival us..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan sighed with emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, his expression changed. "However, there are still differences between True Immortal script characters!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"All the True Immortal script characters we have exchanged so far, when added together, probably do not compare to this one I am about to display!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">These words were earth-shattering. The elders of the Immortal Boat instantly suppressed their scheming thoughts and stared blankly at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, you shouldn't speak carelessly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan sighed again, and then, with a wave of his hand, a silver-white formation covering the sky gradually unfolded."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the great formation, pavilions and towers rose, and bridges over flowing water were nestled among them. Clear springs flowed beneath the bridges, shimmering with light. Fish could even be seen swimming playfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Light and shadow shifted, creating an illusion that was as real as reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected, this scene of pavilions and flowing water was conjured instantly by the great array!" Jian Daosheng observed his surroundings, vaguely sensing that this seemed to be merely a formation for constructing buildings in the Star Sea. However, its ability to create such an illusion, making even him unable to distinguish between reality and deception, undoubtedly indicated its extraordinary nature.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's merely a trivial skill," Li Fan said nonchalantly. "Studying True Immortal script characters has already exhausted all my efforts. How could I have the energy to study formations..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng nodded in agreement, believing him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After observing the surroundings within the great array and finding no anomalies, Jian Daosheng cupped his hands and said, "Then it's settled. Fellow Daoist, please wait here. Before this incense burns out, I will definitely return with my companions."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Jian Daosheng spoke, he waved his large sleeve, and a clump of earthy yellow incense flew out from his sleeve and stood in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flame had already ignited, and smoke curled upwards. Jian Daosheng bowed, bid farewell, and his figure vanished into the dark Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gazed into the distance for a long time before finally returning to Yin Shangren and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Master..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's sudden departure and prolonged absence naturally made Yin Shangren and the others realize that they must have encountered trouble. Now that Li Fan had reappeared, they asked with concern.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I never imagined that there were still surviving civilizations in this frontier of the Star Sea. It must have been disturbed when I set up the formation to connect to the Xuanhuang Realm." Li Fan said with a heavy expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His words were earth-shattering, and everyone was stunned. "Here? It's all dead silence. Where do they live?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'm not sure yet, we only had a brief encounter. However, given that they could survive the destruction of the Star Sea, these people are certainly not to be underestimated. You all should remain hidden for now. Wait for me to investigate thoroughly before we proceed." Li Fan instructed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unknown entities in the Star Sea were more likely to be enemies than friends. Caution was never excessive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taking advantage of the time before the Immortal Boat group arrived, Li Fan continued to lecture Yin Shangren and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Relics contain True Immortal remnants, and so do world fragments. If we were to allow the Xuanhuang Realm to absorb world fragments filled with True Immortal remnants..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It might cause world turmoil and lead to the devastation of all living beings."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, so many years have passed since the Great Calamity of the Star Sea. There must be some remnant realms whose True Immortal power has mostly dissipated. Only such realms can serve as medicinal ingredients." Li Fan spoke eloquently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With so many of us working separately, it shouldn't be difficult to find suitable medicinal ingredients, looking at the continuous chain of remnant realms in the Remnant Realm Great Wall," Qiao Gong said, gazing at the distant Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a flick of his finger, the Wooden Sword phantom instantly appeared at the edge of the Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You might as well go out and try." Li Fan said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Qiao Gong was the first to leave the scope of the Wooden Sword phantom's protection. The moment he stepped outside, his expression changed drastically. He felt like he was being pulled by a massive suction force, uncontrollably drawn towards the Remnant Realm Great Wall!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Stabilize!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A golden armor appeared on his body. Qiao Gong struggled frantically, and with great effort, he managed to stabilize himself in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he still could not resist the tendency to move towards the Remnant Realm Great Wall. The light of his armor flickered continuously, seemingly reaching its limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan manipulated the Wooden Sword phantom to envelop Qiao Gong once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Freed from the terrifying suction, Qiao Gong looked at the Remnant Realm Great Wall before him with lingering fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's an Immortal Ruins here too?!" Everyone was shocked beyond words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not an Immortal Ruins. It's the High Wall," Li Fan said slowly, his tone ethereal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The suction force from the Immortal Ruins is blocked by the High Wall at the Star Sea frontier. Then, through means we cannot comprehend, it gathers beneath the High Wall. Over time, it has formed this anomaly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The reason the world fragments are connected is also to resist this [Echoing Star Power]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene Li Fan painted deeply shocked everyone present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even without seeing the invisible High Wall, the fact that it could contain the suction force that destroyed the entire Star Sea proved its power and mystery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Acting near the Remnant Realm Great Wall will not be much less dangerous than being near the Xuanhuang Realm's border. A slight misstep could lead to losing control and crashing into a remnant realm. If there are still True Immortal remnants within..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Also, influenced by the Echoing Star Power, the range of our divine sense exploration is greatly reduced. This is the difficulty in finding medicinal ingredients and suitable remnant realms to fill them," Li Fan said with a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan extended his hand, and a crystal like a silk ribbon, shimmering with seven colors, appeared in his palm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is [Empty Clarity Flowing Crystal]. Coupled with the [Splitting Light and Melting Rainbow] technique, it can resist this pervasive suction force to some extent."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Remember, do not push yourselves too hard. When the remaining Hong light is only one-third, you can leave in advance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan imparted the Empty Clarity Flowing Crystal and the Splitting Light and Melting Rainbow technique to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, if you could all reach the realm of 'No Sword, No Self' like me, perhaps you could ignore this Echoing Star Power to some extent." The Wooden Sword phantom flickered, bringing everyone back to a safe area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Remnant Realm Great Wall contains countless world fragments. It is extremely difficult for me alone to find suitable medicinal ingredients. Therefore, I need your assistance." Li Fan said earnestly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua couldn't help but ask at this moment, "Saint Master, what is your ultimate goal in going to such lengths? Is it merely to aid Xuanhuang's ascension and benefit from it?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gave a faint smile. "Xuanhuang's ascension and escape from the catastrophic crisis. We, nurtured by heaven and earth, might have the chance to break through the mortal limit. It is a win-win situation, is it not enough?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the others wanted to ask further questions, Li Fan's eyes flickered. "More people are coming. I'll be back shortly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You all wait here for now and familiarize yourselves with the use of the Splitting Light and Melting Rainbow technique."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before his words finished, Li Fan's figure vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Wooden Sword phantom, everyone fell into a prolonged silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, Xu Ke broke the silence. "Actually, with the Saint Master's strength alone, he could probably facilitate Xuanhuang's ascension. It would just take more time."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, he still brought us 'burdens' along... It reminds me of Mr. Bai back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xu Ke sighed emotionally, his eyes filled with endless nostalgia.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, everyone else fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, from their perspective, they truly possessed nothing worthy of the Saint Master's schemes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside the pavilion and tower formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat gathered, observing from a distance without entering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their divine senses exchanged continuously. "How is it? Is it a trap?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems we were overly concerned. There are indeed no offensive measures; it should just be an illusion formation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it's just a mere formation. How powerful can it be? We have so many people; are we afraid of him alone?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's right. Under the might of True Immortal scripts, what formation would not turn to dust?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't forget, the other party also understands True Immortal scripts. And perhaps even more profoundly than us..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders' communication ceased abruptly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, the true form of Li Fan, who had been lecturing on the Dao, emerged from the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He held Jian Daosheng's incense in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The incense had about one-third remaining. Li Fan surveyed everyone and nodded. "As expected, they keep their word."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng introduced everyone: "This is Gan Jingda. This is Nangong Lie..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a round of pleasantries, Li Fan invited everyone into the formation for a detailed discussion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Residing in one of the pavilions, everyone present got straight to the point.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"May I ask how many True Immortal scripts your homeland has deciphered so far?" Jian Daosheng asked directly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This question was crucial. The elders of the Immortal Boat all looked at Li Fan, awaiting his reply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thirteen," Li Fan said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat exchanged glances. Most wore expressions of disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, it's a few less. However, only those with an accuracy rate above ninety percent are counted," Li Fan added.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, the elders of the Immortal Boat could no longer contain themselves and eagerly asked, "Is what Daoist friend said true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan chuckled, his expression filled with pride. "I never utter falsehoods!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover... there is no need for exaggeration." Li Fan dismissed them with a look of arrogance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, who had been plotting in secret, instantly quelled their intentions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They exchanged glances and whispered amongst themselves, discussing the credibility of Li Fan's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nangong Lie: "One True Immortal script is worth more than all of ours combined? I don't believe such nonsense."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "It's better to believe it than not. The civilization this person belongs to has research capabilities comparable to ours. If they were lucky enough to discover something, acting rashly might cause us to miss this golden opportunity."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi: "Indeed. Possessing True Immortal scripts, it's too difficult to capture them alive. We can only strike swiftly and incapacitate him. In that case, we must extract as much knowledge from his mind as possible before acting."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Regardless of the outcome, this child knows too many secrets of the Immortal Boat. We must not let him leave." This was a consensus already reached by the elders of the Immortal Boat. Therefore, after Jian Daosheng spoke these words, no one objected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough," Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. "Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, "Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, "Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, "What does Daoist friend mean by that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. "In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. "Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. "However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, "To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat," Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fact that the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat sold Immortal Artifacts was known only to a very small number of forces back then. Since this person can mention this matter, it should be true..." Nangong Lie slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the rest?" Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must obtain it at all costs!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>

<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the rest?" Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must obtain it at all costs!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough," Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. "Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, "Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, "Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, "What does Daoist friend mean by that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. "In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. "Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. "However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, "To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>

<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>

<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the rest?" Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must obtain it at all costs!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough," Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. "Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, "Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, "Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, "What does Daoist friend mean by that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. "In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. "Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. "However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, "To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat," Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, "What does Daoist friend mean by that?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. "In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. "Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. "However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, "To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat.

<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat," Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fact that the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat sold Immortal Artifacts was known only to a very small number of forces back then. Since this person can mention this matter, it should be true..." Nangong Lie slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please watch carefully!" Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about the rest?" Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must obtain it at all costs!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, "Perhaps we can do this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. "Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough," Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. "Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, "Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, "Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>

<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: "Old Zhong, is this true?"</p>

<p class="calibre2">"Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the<bos> of Li Fan's mind. He focused on the character [Fall]. He tried to replicate it, but Jian Daosheng's expression was that of an elder of the Immortal Boat.</bos></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The True Immortal script characters themselves are not powerful, but the Great Dao they point to."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyes flashed. He had already accumulated knowledge on more than ten True Immortal script characters and their corresponding Great Daos.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes, the value of the [Fall] character is not high, but it represents the Great Dao of falling. It only represents a small part of the Great Dao."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In addition, the [Fall] character represents the meaning of destruction and chaos. However, it also represents the meaning of rebirth and prosperity."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"All things in the world have two sides. When the end comes, there is also the beginning."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The [Fall] character can also represent the meaning of a new beginning."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And the meaning of [Fall] itself is a small part of the [Creation] character."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for the [Destruction] character, it is a small part of the [Creation] character."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat looked at each other. They couldn't believe what they were hearing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How could this cultivator, who claimed to be from Great Qi, understand the "Great Dao" so deeply?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then continued, "The value of a True Immortal script character is not determined by its power, but by its representation of the Great Dao."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The more profound and complete the Great Dao it represents, the higher its value."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, the value of this [Fall] character is far beyond the sum of ten other True Immortal script characters."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all silent. They were not sure if Li Fan was telling the truth. However, they were profoundly impressed by his understanding of the Great Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If that is the case," Jian Daosheng said, "then we must see it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, you have only shown us the [Fall] character. We must also reveal our secrets."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded. "Of course."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Here are five True Immortal script characters from my homeland," Li Fan said, projecting five characters into the void: [Chaos], [Non-existence], [Nothingness], [Xuān], and [Sadness].</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat looked at each other, not understanding the meaning of these characters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the fact that Li Fan was willing to share his secrets, and that these characters were also True Immortal script characters, made them willing to continue the exchange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"These five characters," Li Fan said, "represent the Great Dao of Chaos, Non-existence, Nothingness, Longevity, and Sadness, respectively."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"These five Great Daos are only slightly weaker than the Great Dao represented by the [Fall] character."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat looked at each other, speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They had never expected that Li Fan would be able to decipher so many Great Daos.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However," Li Fan added, "there is one thing I need to remind you of."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"These five characters are only the weaker versions of the Great Daos. The complete versions are far more powerful."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But even so, they are still far superior to any True Immortal script characters that your Immortal Boat has deciphered so far."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's arrogance was not without reason. He had the Ultimate Separation Disc, and his understanding of the Great Dao far surpassed that of these Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all shocked. They had never imagined that there could be True Immortal script characters far more powerful than any they had encountered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If that is the case," Jian Daosheng said, "then we must see the complete versions."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, showing you the complete versions is not possible. Because the complete versions are simply too powerful, and they can only be displayed in the Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But," Li Fan said, "I can use the weakened versions to demonstrate the power of the Great Dao."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then began to demonstrate the power of the five Great Daos.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all dumbfounded. They had never seen such profound and powerful Great Daos before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They looked at Li Fan with newfound respect. This cultivator from Great Qi was truly astonishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We have lost this exchange," Jian Daosheng admitted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, we are still willing to fulfill our promise."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We will allow you to choose any three treasures from the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded. "I accept your offer."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He then chose three treasures from the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record].</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first was the [Book of Ten Thousand Realms], the second was the [Origin Force Essence], and the third was the [Seed of Life].</p>
<p class="calibre2">With these three treasures, Li Fan felt that his plan to ascend the Xuanhuang Realm would be greatly accelerated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the exchange, Li Fan and the elders of the Immortal Boat parted ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan returned to the Great Profound Minor World, ready to continue his plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat returned to their own world, deeply impressed by Li Fan's knowledge and power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They knew that they had encountered a truly formidable opponent.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-334" class="calibre1">The exchange was over, but the competition between Li Fan and the Immortal Boat was far from over.Chapter 1319</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing Li Fan's request, the elders of the Immortal Boat found nothing inappropriate. However, they also presented their own demands: "True Immortal script characters are absolute secrets of the Immortal Boat. Although this place is in the deserted depths of the Star Sea, we must guard against eavesdropping and prying eyes."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, we must also set up an array here!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled, "As you wish. If you find setting up the formation strenuous, I can also help."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat coldly snorted and paid no attention to Li Fan's teasing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Joining forces, they set up another layer of formation within the "Illusion Formation" Li Fan had laid out. After finally feeling assured that everything was foolproof, they began the formal exchange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am Jian Daosheng, please enlighten me!" Without unnecessary pleasantries, Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard of the Immortal Boat, solemnly wrote a True Immortal script character on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps to suppress Li Fan's arrogance and gain the upper hand, the True Immortal script character he chose this time was indeed not simple. Li Fan had never had the opportunity to come into contact with it during his studies with the Immortal Boat in his previous life, even when he later became Ai Tianjue's disciple and was almost a core member of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dark lines slowly drifted in the void. The moment the character was fully formed, it was as if a great sun illuminated the dark Star Sea where Li Fan and the Immortal Boat elders were located.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This True Immortal script character brought not only a change in light and darkness. Under the light, it actually brought a hint of vitality to the dead and silent Utmost Darkness Star Sea!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A True Immortal script with a positive effect?" Li Fan's heart stirred, and his expression immediately turned serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ignoring Jian Daosheng's rather proud demeanor, he focused solely on the True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Li Fan's current knowledge, especially after glimpsing the mysterious characters of "Creation" and the one that created the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate's bloodline, his ability to decipher True Immortal script characters was almost unparalleled in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Carefully observing the character that occasionally moved and changed, yet remained like a high-hanging sun, it only took the time it takes for a cup of tea for the original meaning of the True Immortal script character represented by this character to appear in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">[ Sunrise ].</p>
<p class="calibre2">The myriad phenomena of the sun rising, vital energy circulating, and all things reviving... collectively formed this special True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So that's how it is."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After completing the deciphering of the [sunrise] character, Li Fan also resolved a long-standing question in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How did the Profound Immortal Boat survive the destruction of the Star Sea to this day?</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, Li Fan thought it was the Immortal Boat Divine Tree formed by the Seed of Life. But after staying in the Immortal Boat for several years, he gradually discovered something was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat Divine Tree needed to continuously absorb strange objects like the Dao-Confronting Giant and the Human Emperor Rabbit to provide sufficient energy for the Immortal Boat. This indicated that the Divine Tree itself was insufficient to offset the energy consumption of the Immortal Boat's normal operation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the past nearly ten thousand years, the Divine Tree was not always absorbing external energy. What guaranteed the lush growth of the Divine Tree during this blank period?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the environment within the Immortal Boat, which was as vibrant and warm as a normal cultivation world, did not seem to be something that a mere otherworldly Divine Tree could provide. Let alone anything else, even the本体 of the Immortal Boat Divine Tree, the Otherworldly Divine Tree of the Xuanhuang Realm's Divine Tree Sect, did not possess such miraculous abilities back then.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today, with the appearance of this [sunrise] character, the mystery was finally solved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was precisely this True Immortal script character representing the phenomenon of sunrise that had provided the Immortal Boat with a suitable living environment for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the foundation of the Profound Immortal Boat's survival, an undeniable treasure. These people from the Immortal Boat actually took it out first..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems they don't intend to let me leave?" Li Fan was very familiar with the temperaments of these elders from his time in the Immortal Boat in his previous life. They valued the True Immortal script characters and the future of the Immortal Boat more than their own lives. Yet, they are now imparting the ultimate secret that determines the future of the Immortal Boat...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if it was "one character exchanged for one character," it seemed extremely suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Unfortunately, your plan is destined to be in vain. You can act as a nuisance, but to keep me... Hmph!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The formation jointly laid out by the elders of the Immortal Boat, in Li Fan's eyes, was like a child's play, full of loopholes. Moreover, with the peerless escape technique he now possessed, even if a True Immortal descended, he was eighty percent confident he could escape calmly. Naturally, he was not afraid of the siege by the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pretending to be unaware of their scheme, Li Fan continued to focus on deciphering the [sunrise] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As his research deepened, he discovered something was amiss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The [sunrise] character indeed represented the phenomenon of newborn sun. The morning sun was gentle, but that was from the perspective of the Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For beings in the lower realms, the gentle sunlight from the Immortal Realm's morning sun was not something they could withstand. If the [sunrise] character descended, it would not bring vitality. Instead, it would instantly burn the world into a hellscape!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So, this is not a True Immortal script character with positive effects either. It still represents destruction and chaos. It's just that the people of the Immortal Boat have weakened the completeness of the True Immortal script character and reduced its power, thus turning harm into benefit."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brilliant, worthy of a force that has survived the Great Tribulation. They truly have some tricks up their sleeves." Li Fan praised inwardly. However, his face changed drastically, and he glared at the elders of the Immortal Boat, "Is this not right?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This [sunrise] character's completeness is not even ninety percent! Are you trying to deceive me?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan appeared furious, then full of disappointment. "Forget it. I didn't expect you to be such untrustworthy people. The exchange is canceled!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were surprised that Li Fan could see through the weakness of the [sunrise] character so quickly. While shocked, Jian Daosheng quickly explained to Li Fan, "Fellow Daoist, you misunderstand! It's not that I deliberately hid it. In fact, for our lower realm, the [sunrise] character with thirty percent completeness is more useful than one with higher completeness!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, if Fellow Daoist insists, displaying the complete [sunrise] character is also fine."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After speaking, Jian Daosheng wrote the [sunrise] character again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the [All Laws] greatly reduced the power of the True Immortal script character, Li Fan could still feel the suffocating heat waves that instantly replaced the warmth around him the moment the character took shape. Vitality vanished in an instant, turning into a grim killing intent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan recorded the complete [sunrise] character, then said, "Alright, I must admit, you are right."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since it was a misunderstanding, let the exchange continue!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing Li Fan's words, the elders of the Immortal Boat secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan coughed lightly, drawing everyone's attention. "Everyone, watch closely!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">With swift and elegant strokes, the [Fall] character was written instantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the [Fall] character appeared, the expressions of the elders of the Immortal Boat became somewhat subtle. Especially Ai Tianjue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He stared blankly at the character in the void ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He probably never imagined that the True Immortal script character he had researched the most would be written by the other party first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The completeness has far exceeded the current progress of the Immortal Boat, likely approaching ninety percent. This..." Ai Tianjue couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, Ai Tianjue didn't know that the [Fall] character Li Fan wrote at this moment had not reached ninety percent completeness. Following the teachings of Ai Tianjue from decades later in his previous life, Li Fan's deciphering of the [Fall] character was only around eighty percent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan combined his understanding of "Creation" and the mysterious character that represented the transformation between Immortals and mortals, and even incorporated a trace of the "Transformation between True and False." He reorganized and modified the [Fall] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Infused with a deeper aura of power, Li Fan's written [Fall] character looked even more "advanced." It was even more like the original [Fall] character than the original [Fall] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had no confidence before whether he could deceive the elders of the Immortal Boat with such a method. However, judging from their expressions now, it was definitely feasible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, he sneered inwardly, feeling even more confident about the smooth progress of his plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Elders, what do you think of this [Fall] character?" Li Fan asked loudly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they desperately wanted to say that this [Fall] character overlapped with the Immortal Boat's research, they were inferior to the other party in research progress. And in a short period, the elders of the Immortal Boat would not be able to elevate their understanding of the [Fall] character to Li Fan's level.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat looked at each other and deliberated. Finally, they decided to accept this loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, it was the Immortal Boat's turn to act again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi of the Severed Immortal Tower wrote the True Immortal script character [Lone].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Li Fan's research on this True Immortal script character was still ahead of the Immortal Boat's, for the sake of "casting a long line to catch a big fish," Li Fan did not go too far.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He pretended to mutter, "[Lone] is a character not uncommon in the Star Sea. However, our research progress is indeed not as good as yours."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands, "I have learned from you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, the Immortal Boat elders breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, exchanges so far had resulted in significant losses for the Immortal Boat. This reversal of the situation was a good start.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Li Fan's turn. The [Suppress] character appeared in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This [Suppress] character was also derived from the research of the Immortal Boat. However, the deciphering progress had not even reached one-third, and it was completely unsystematic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In his previous life, Li Fan had passed on this incomplete [Suppress] character to Sun Tianci. With his extraordinary comprehension, he had completed further derivations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this life, adding his own understanding and reconstructing it, Li Fan completed the fabrication.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Similarly, he intended to test the level of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The result...</p>
<p class="calibre2">After deliberation by Zhong Daogong and others, they approved the True Immortal script character provided by Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan remained silent on the surface, but inwardly he understood: "It seems the Profound Immortal Boat has not encountered any True Immortal script characters of the [Creation] level."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Imitating and replicating from top to bottom is truly not something they can see through in a short time."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, with time, they might notice some clues..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan mused inwardly, and the Immortal Boat then presented a new True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the character appeared, both the formation jointly laid out by the Immortal Boat and Li Fan's "Illusion Formation" trembled slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As an absolute master of formations, Li Fan keenly sensed that under the influence of this new True Immortal script character, the very finest units maintaining the formation structure were beginning to disintegrate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was instantly startled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, the formation he had casually laid out was by no means a simple illusion formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a pseudo-immortal formation that integrated downscaled versions of two immortal-grade formations, "[Desolation, Empty Chamber Sprouts Flowers]" and "[Immortal Descent, Myriad Things Return to Void]!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">It hid killing intent in the unseen, capable of silently killing all enemies who entered the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even such a formation was damaged to its foundation by a weakened True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the power of this True Immortal script character were fully displayed, my pseudo-immortal formation would likely be shattered in an instant." As formations were Li Fan's most important trump card, his heart became incomparably solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While re-repairing the gradually collapsing formation, he also studied this newly appeared True Immortal script character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Undoubtedly, it is a formation-specialized character."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With this True Immortal script character, it is no wonder the Immortal Boat's formation level is so low."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is hard to say whether the Immortal Boat showing me this character has any intention of showing off."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Learning this character makes this trip worthwhile." Li Fan was very satisfied with this exchange of True Immortal script characters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, he gradually deciphered the true meaning of the character before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">[Dissolve].</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he comprehended the original true meaning of the True Immortal script character, Li Fan thought of his treasure, the Ultimate Separation Disc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, my Separation Disc now, like the Dharma Derivation Jade, can be considered a part of the Great Dao's projection from bottom to top."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, I can try to glimpse the Dao of [Dissolve] through the Separation Disc."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the number of True Immortal script characters he mastered increased, Li Fan gradually discovered that what was powerful was not the True Immortal script characters themselves, but the Great Dao they pointed to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The True Immortal script characters were merely shortcuts and tools to help ordinary people, and even ordinary immortals, to touch upon the Great Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Similarly, world wonders and eternal remnants are also similar shortcut tools."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Their essence is actually interconnected."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao Inscription Immortal."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly thought of this nameless True Immortal, who was said to have inscribed myriad Dao paths, making them more "approachable."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao paths cannot be cultivated together. Yet this Dao Inscription Immortal can know so much about the myriad Great Daos..." It was truly beyond Li Fan's current imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's fleeting thoughts did not affect the True Immortal script exchange meeting in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan used [Chaos], [Non-existence], [Nothingness], and the [Xuān] character he learned from the Immortal Boat in his previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nearly emptied the Immortal Boat's research foundation on True Immortal script characters over several thousand years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, [Chaos], [Non-existence], and others were not the complete versions he saw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were weakened versions modified slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides [sunrise] and [dissolve],</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan learned two more characters: [Cold] and [Loss].</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point, both sides had almost exhausted their reserves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The atmosphere in the venue gradually became subtle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan spoke first, slightly breaking the stalemate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I must admit that your research on True Immortal script characters is indeed not inferior to ours in Great Qi."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I never imagined that there would still be a surviving civilization within the Star Sea that could rival us..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan sighed with emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, his expression changed. "However, there are still differences between True Immortal script characters!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"All the True Immortal script characters we have exchanged so far, when added together, probably do not compare to this one I am about to display!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">These words were earth-shattering. The elders of the Immortal Boat instantly suppressed their scheming thoughts and stared blankly at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, you shouldn't speak carelessly."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-335" class="calibre1">Chapter 1320: Shock of Creation</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'I never utter falsehoods!' 'Moreover... there is no need for exaggeration,' Li Fan said with an arrogant tone, glancing disdainfully at everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, whose earlier restless intentions had been quelled, exchanged glances, murmuring amongst themselves about the credibility of Li Fan's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nangong Lie: 'A single True Immortal script character, worth more than all of ours combined? I don't believe such nonsense.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: 'It's better to believe it than not. The civilization this person belongs to researches True Immortal scripts with a depth no less than ours at the Immortal Boat. If they were lucky enough to discover something, acting rashly might cause us to miss this golden opportunity.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi: 'Indeed. Possessing True Immortal script characters, it's too difficult to capture them alive. We can only strike swiftly and incapacitate him. In that case, we must extract as much knowledge from his mind as possible before acting.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Regardless of the outcome, this child knows too many secrets of the Immortal Boat. We must not let him leave.' This was a consensus already reached by the elders of the Immortal Boat. Therefore, after Zhong Daogong spoke these words, no one objected.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, 'Perhaps we can do this...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. 'Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough,' Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. 'Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, 'Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, 'Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, 'What does Daoist friend mean by that?'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. 'In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. 'Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. 'However, there is one thing I truly do not understand. The [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record] is a top secret within the Immortal Boat. How could an outsider like Daoist friend know of its existence?'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, 'To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: 'Old Zhong, is this true?'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat,' Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'The fact that the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat sold Immortal Artifacts was known only to a very small number of forces back then. Since this person can mention this matter, it should be true...' Nangong Lie slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Everyone, please watch carefully!' Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'What about the rest?' Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'This scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'We must obtain it at all costs!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, 'Perhaps we can do this...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>

<p class="calibre2">Ever since he learned the identity of the Immortal Boat, Li Fan's attitude had become much friendlier. He explained to the Immortal Boat elders, 'To be honest, my homeland, Great Qi, has a deep connection with the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. It was precisely through the Immortal Artifacts traded from the Immortal Boat in ancient times that we were able to survive the Great Calamity...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Furthermore, that Immortal Artifact is still protecting us. Therefore, the entire Great Qi feels a sense of gratitude towards the Immortal Boat...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Li Fan's explanation, the elders of the Immortal Boat were somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda: 'Old Zhong, is this true?'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong frowned, recalling the records of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'In ancient times, the Immortal Boat did complete several transactions involving Immortal Artifacts. However, according to regulations and the demands of the customers, the relevant information was destroyed after the transaction was completed. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's central core should have backups, but due to internal strife... that portion of information should now be with the Merchant Immortal Boat,' Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'The fact that the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat sold Immortal Artifacts was known only to a very small number of forces back then. Since this person can mention this matter, it should be true...' Nangong Lie slowly said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Deep research into True Immortal scripts, and protection from an Immortal Artifact...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The great civilization of Great Qi, which had survived since ancient times, slowly emerged in the minds of the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan gave them another huge surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Since you are from the Immortal Boat, things will be easier.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'The Immortal Boat has always conducted business with integrity. I trust you!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Originally, I planned to adopt a wait-and-see approach, as this True Immortal script is too precious, obtained from the Immortal Realm's records within the Immortal Artifact...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Every word Li Fan spoke tugged at the heartstrings of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'Everyone, please watch carefully!' Li Fan's voice suddenly rose several degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusionary formation of pavilions and towers suddenly vanished, replaced by a boundless stretch of grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the grassland, a solitary stone stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, the earth began to tremble.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Large patches of green grass, as if stimulated, began to grow wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In an instant, it grew to be taller than a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It even pushed the solitary stone on the grassland up from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A luminous arc appeared in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The arc was seven-colored, and within it, lightning flashed and storms converged. Around the seven-colored arc, numerous invisible phantoms gathered. They converged in one place, as if awaiting something.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A bolt of dark lightning suddenly struck the ground from the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The world was split in two, and deep cracks appeared in space, which took a long time to heal. On the grassland, the lush green grass ignited, and fierce flames spread rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The grassland trembled, and beneath the raging inferno, something seemed to be awakening.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">And high in the sky, the invisible figures around the arc gathered even closer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even conflicts arose as they vied for positions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Continuous booming and clashing sounds echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The storm reached its peak and then instantly fell silent. The rolling dark clouds vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the seven-colored arc, under a clear sky for thousands of miles, a profound character appeared!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders, who had been deeply immersed, suddenly their eyes widened in anger and they turned to look at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'What about the rest?' Jian Daosheng shouted frantically, disregarding his appearance. This Chief of the Immortal Hub Courtyard had vaguely seen the True Immortal script contained within the arc.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though Li Fan had suddenly interrupted the scene, preventing him from seeing the complete picture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Jian Daosheng was still certain that the power of that True Immortal script far surpassed any other True Immortal script they had ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'This scene... it's far more powerful than the first time I saw a True Immortal script. Its might is far superior to a single character!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'We must obtain it at all costs!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, while outwardly calm, were in an uproar inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Ai Tianjue transmitted mentally, 'Perhaps we can do this...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a brief exchange, they reached a unified opinion. This time, Jian Daosheng acted as the spokesperson. 'Since Daoist friend is so confident, we are indeed very interested.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'A value that surpasses the sum of more than ten True Immortal scripts... If what Daoist friend says is true, we are willing to pay any price to see it.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'However, what else can you produce? Just the genuine True Immortal script artifacts are not enough,' Li Fan said arrogantly, making a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Daosheng smiled faintly. 'Daoist friend, rest assured. Our world possesses the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record], passed down from ancient times. It contains records of treasures and specialties from ruined cultivation realms throughout the Star Sea. If what Daoist friend says is true, besides that True Immortal script artifact, we agree to let you choose any three treasures from it...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan seemed unmoved by the conditions proposed by Jian Daosheng, constantly murmuring to himself, 'Hundred Hearing Immortal Record, Hundred Hearing Immortal Record... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to recall something and exclaimed, 'Profound Merchant Immortal Boat?!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a clap of thunder, the words echoed in the ears of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their auras shifted instantly, and they all became extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw that the situation was not right and secretly signaled the other elders to prepare for action. He forced a smile and asked, 'What does Daoist friend mean by that?'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan cupped his hands. 'In ancient times, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat traversed the myriad realms. Who doesn't know of it? I thought the Immortal Boat had disappeared with the silence of the Star Sea. To think that it has survived for ten thousand years!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'If my teachers knew, they would surely be overjoyed. No, I must hurry and inform them...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words made Zhong Daogong's eyelids twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He quickly interrupted Li Fan and changed the subject. 'Daoist friend flatters us. Since our identity has been recognized by Daoist friend, we shall no longer conceal it.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">'We are indeed descendants of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. However, many things have happened over these ten thousand years. Although we survived the Great Calamity, the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two. We are from one of them.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan, who seemed somewhat surprised, and raised an eyebrow. 'However, there is one thing I truly do not understand.

<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-336" class="calibre1">Chapter 1321: Legal Transmission is Accused of Being a Mystery</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected of the secret vault inherited by the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat since antiquity, the Hundred Hearings Immortal Record truly contains many treasures."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As the only surviving land in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, the Profound Yellow Realm can be said to have accumulated the essence of the entire Star Sea. And Li Fan, through his hundred reincarnations, has practically scoured the Profound Yellow Realm clean. Ordinary secret treasures and riches naturally hold little appeal to him."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But as he walked through this place, Li Fan still saw several items that piqued his interest."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"For example: a fabricated immortal crane. According to the information in the Hundred Hearings Immortal Record, this bronze immortal crane was actually cast from the remnants of numerous immortal artifacts. While it possessed no inherent immortal abilities, due to its material composition, it was incomparably hard. All divine abilities and techniques were incapable of damaging it in the slightest. It was not truly indestructible, but at the very least, the cataclysm that destroyed the Star Sea had failed to inflict any damage upon it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Constrained by mortal materials, the Heavenly Sun Immortal Puppets refined in previous lives, despite being augmented by Origin Force Essence, still failed to break the mortal limit. Being able to hold off the Dharma transmission for a while was already a testament to the Heavenly Sun's resolute combat will. However, if this item were mixed into the smelting process...' Li Fan's thoughts flashed by."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Another example: a streak of seven-colored flowing light. It looked remarkably similar to the [Seven-Colored Imperial Sky Flowing Light] that Elder Zhong had fished out from the Fishing Pond. However, the Seven-Colored Imperial Sky Flowing Light was refined from the seven streams of flowing light that illuminated the world, collected by a cultivator of great divine ability. It was an evolution of the Heavenly Dao, containing the origin of the world. This beam of flowing light in the Hundred Hearings Immortal Record, however, was a residue from an unknown cultivation world after its natural demise. It could be considered the corpse of a cultivation world."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan had personally refined the Seven-Colored Imperial Sky Flowing Light before. In his perception, although the two seven-colored flowing lights were not identical in essence, they were subtly connected."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Perhaps it involves the evolution from death to life of a world...' Li Fan, who had already claimed the Fishing Pond as his own in this life, naturally felt the urge to collect both seven-colored lights for a detailed comparison."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And then there was: a mannequin standing with empty hands, its eyelids lowered. The Profound Merchant Immortal Boat had acquired it by chance, but after studying it in every way possible, they couldn't figure out its function. Thus, it was placed in the secret vault, slowly forgotten by the world. When Li Fan passed by this mannequin, he clearly sensed a subtle disturbance from [Return to Reality]. Although it wasn't as excited as when he encountered an Eternal Relic, its ability to elicit a reaction from [Return to Reality] was enough to prove its extraordinary nature."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'It should also be related to the [Dao Projection].' Li Fan remained expressionless, his gaze not lingering on the mannequin."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan patiently selected items in the Immortal Boat's secret vault, while three elders from the Immortal Boat followed him closely. They did not interfere nor speak, but simply watched Li Fan's every move with unyielding scrutiny."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'It seems the thief from back then caused the Immortal Boat quite heavy losses. Even with the [Severed Immortal Arm] as a failsafe, my fellow Daoists are still uneasy,' Li Fan remarked playfully as a thought flickered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gan Jingda, Nangong Lie, and Lu Yuzhi maintained their composure, as if pretending not to have heard him."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'I wonder what priceless treasures the Immortal Boat lost back then?' Li Fan continued his treasure hunt, asking casually."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Hmph, hmph...' Most of the Immortal Boat elders wore expressions of righteous indignation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's voice drifted from afar, "'The past is too painful to recall. But since so many years have passed, if you are interested, Daoist friend, I don't mind telling you.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Among the treasures lost by the Immortal Boat, the most precious was the [Crystal Ice Immortal Amber],' Zhong Daogong's tone was tinged with reminiscence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Seeing Jian Daosheng, the Chief of the Severing Immortal Tower, seemingly being a direct witness to that event, he suddenly sighed, 'Even now, the dreamlike and ethereal appearance of the [Crystal Ice Immortal Amber] occasionally surfaces in my mind. I only regret not being more forceful in preventing it back then, thus leading to tragedy.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The other elders lamented in unison."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan asked curiously, '[Crystal Ice Immortal Amber]? The name sounds beautiful. But what exactly is this thing?'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhong Daogong explained, 'The Crystal Ice Immortal Amber is, in fact, a frozen cultivation world. The origin of this item goes back to antiquity, which involved an extremely rare celestial phenomenon in the Star Sea.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan's curiosity deepened, and he humbly asked, 'I wish to hear the details.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'At that time, the Star Sea was not as dead and silent as it is now. Besides the countless cultivation worlds brimming with life and diverse landscapes, there were also many Star Sea anomalies that appeared from time to time.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'The Leaping Celestial Whale, the Galloping Star Horse, the Yin-Yang vortex...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'When these anomalies erupted, they often covered an entire star region and affected dozens of cultivation worlds. Some merely manifested strange phenomena within the world's celestial dome, while others caused cataclysmic destruction to cultivation worlds!'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'The [Crystalline Frost Wind], was one such anomaly.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'An unknown cold wind descended from the stars and swept across the land. Wherever the cold wind passed, whether it was Nascent Soul, Dao Integration, or Longevity cultivators, all were instantly frozen without even the slightest chance to react. All living beings in the world, and even the world itself, were turned into ice sculptures under the breath of the Crystalline Frost Wind,' Zhong Daogong tapped his finger lightly, and a terrifying scene of a world frozen by cold wind appeared above the Immortal Boat's secret vault."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'A cultivation world sealed by ice, and thus remained isolated in the Star Sea forever, never to see the day of thawing. Any being that attempted to approach would be affected by the absolute cold, either fleeing with severe injuries or similarly becoming an eternal ice sculpture.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan looked at the scene above, frowning slightly, 'I understand the meaning of the crystal ice now. But what does the term [Immortal Amber] mean?'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It was Jian Daosheng who answered Li Fan's question, 'If it were merely a world sealed by ice, it wouldn't be considered a treasure by the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat. In fact, although the probability of the [Crystalline Frost Wind] is low, given the vastness of the Star Sea and the accumulation of tens of thousands of years...'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'The number of preserved ice-sealed worlds would not be exceedingly small.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'The reason the one collected by the Immortal Boat back then was so valuable, however, was due to a highly unique existence within that ice-sealed cultivation world.' Jian Daosheng spoke with a trace of wistfulness, as if recalling the past."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'The [Crystalline Frost Wind] descended from the starry sky, and the world should have instantly turned into an ice sculpture. However, a phantom figure appeared in that world, attempting to block the cold wind...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'But, could a Star Sea anomaly be resisted by mortals? It is said that during the most intense Star Sea anomaly, even True Immortals had to retreat. Let alone us mortals.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'So the result was obvious. The act of saving the world was but a futile struggle, leading only to self-destruction. However, it did manage to block the wind for a split second...'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Precisely this momentary change created a completely different ice sculpture. Faced with the world-ending catastrophe, the expressions of the beings varied. Some were terrified, some despairing, some looked at the figure with hope, some in disbelief... It truly embodied the spectrum of sentient beings.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'If it were only this, at most it would be a slightly rare ice-sealed world. It wouldn't warrant our Immortal Boat bestowing it the title [Immortal Amber].'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Jian Daosheng continued, 'We call it [Immortal] precisely because of the phantom figure that attempted to block the [Crystalline Frost Wind].'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hearing this, Li Fan couldn't help but guess, 'Could it be that a True Immortal is truly sealed within that ice-sealed world?'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Jian Daosheng shook his head, 'Not exactly. If a True Immortal were sealed, our Immortal Boat would not dare to keep it on board. But, purely in terms of value, that phantom figure might be more precious than a True Immortal. After all, before the path to immortality was severed, every realm had those who ascended to become Immortals.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'But a solidified [Inner Demon], that is truly unprecedented and exceptionally rare!'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan's eyes narrowed, '[Inner Demon]? Solidified?'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"While possessing Zhao Xian's body and cultivating in his previous life, Li Fan had already experienced the torment of Inner Demons in the core of the Star Sea. As long as one continued to cultivate, Inner Demons would accompany them throughout their journey, relentlessly. Even if forcefully suppressed by external forces, they would eventually return, escalating in intensity. It was precisely because Zhao Xian could no longer bear the interference of Inner Demons and its impact on his cultivation that Li Fan, impatient, directly possessed him using the Dao Core technique."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This was still under the fragmented laws of the Star Sea. If the Inner Demons were to become materialized, how terrifying would they be when the Star Sea's laws were complete?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"No wonder ancient cultivators treated Inner Demons with fear and avoided them at all costs."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what Li Fan experienced through Zhao Xian's body was merely various illusions born from the heart. He had never seen the true source that triggered these illusions."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Inner Demons are a type of law, yet they can manifest physically?' Li Fan feigned astonishment and disbelief."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'This is precisely the preciousness of the [Crystal Ice Immortal Amber]. If one had not seen it with their own eyes, no one would imagine that such a marvel could exist in this world.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'After the Immortal Boat collected this Crystal Ice Immortal Amber, everyone on board debated for decades. Only then did they finally confirm the identity of the phantom Inner Demon within the ice-sealed world. It was speculated that this Inner Demon might be an evolution of the Inner Demon laws from another cultivation world. We just don't know why it left its original world and suffered such an undespicable fate.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhong Daogong suddenly spoke again, 'Regarding this point, the Immortal Boat also had a reasonable guess. Inner Demons are formless and shapeless, unbound by space, and can freely traverse the Star Sea. Without the constraint of form, they can even appear directly within a cultivator's heart. Not a few cultivators have been influenced by Inner Demons, losing their minds and becoming like different people. The invasion of Inner Demons can be considered the highest form of possession.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'This solidified Inner Demon, although extremely special, still cannot escape the inherent characteristics of Inner Demons. Traversing the Star Sea, seeking suitable hosts to parasitize, is its instinct. Perhaps this is why it appeared in that ice-sealed world.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Furthermore, judging by the power it displayed when the world was frozen, it wasn't just mortals. Even the Heavenly Dao consciousness of a world could be eroded by this solidified Inner Demon.'</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Bewitching other world's Heavenly Dao and replacing it. Perhaps calling it a [Heavenly Demon] would be more fitting.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhong Daogong spoke eloquently, his words filled with regret for the lost treasure."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan, however, felt a stir in his heart."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In his mind, he recalled the scene from his previous life during the Star Sea's World-Ending Immortal Array storm, where the Dharma Transmission's body gradually dissolved, revealing a transparent figure within."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The moment Li Fan saw this transparent figure, a faint sense of familiarity washed over him."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It wasn't that Li Fan had seen this transparent figure before."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It was that he had encountered the 'kind' of the transparent figure's 'aura'."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The familiarity came from Tian Jue, Tian Yu, Tian Yin, Tian Yi."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Or rather..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"From the Heavenly Dao Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Heavenly Demon...' "</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan might now understand why the Dharma Transmission was under the control of the Heavenly Physician back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Is the Heavenly Demon also one of the Venerables of the Heavenly Dao Realm?'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'The Venerables of the Heavenly Dao Realm act on behalf of Heaven, upholding the Dao, while the Heavenly Demon is the manifestation of the Inner Demon Dao.' "</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'However, due to its inherent characteristics, the Heavenly Demon roams the Star Sea, often absent from the Heavenly Dao Realm. It might even be unlucky enough to encounter an extremely rare Star Sea anomaly, suffering eternal ice sealing.' "</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'If it weren't for the Dharma Transmission rescuing it later, it would have been forever frozen and become a collection item for the Immortal Boat.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"'But why did the Dharma Transmission rescue the Heavenly Demon? And why was he later corrupted by the Heavenly Demon?'"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In Li Fan's mind, the figure of the Heavenly Physician suddenly appeared."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"From their interactions in the previous life, it was evident that the Dharma Transmission was under the control of the Heavenly Physician."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Previously, Li Fan had speculated that the Dharma Transmission was a clone created by the Heavenly Physician."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But now it seems their relationship might not be that simple."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'The Dharma Transmission, Xuanyuan Gou Dan. Perhaps he is a reincarnation of Xuan Tian King...'"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'The first half of his life, he was just a mortal. Then suddenly, he awakened, as if some consciousness had traversed realms and possessed him,' Li Fan's eyes narrowed."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Regardless of the circumstances, I finally understand why the Dharma Transmission is controlled by the Heavenly Physician. It is due to the influence of the [Heavenly Demon] deep within his soul.' "</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan also thought that the current Profound Yellow Realm no longer had Inner Demons."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it wasn't just the Dharma Transmission's new law."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With the [Heavenly Demon], a materialized Inner Demon, naturally there would be no minor Inner Demons descending to interfere."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With thoughts churning, Li Fan listened to the narration of the Immortal Boat elders and couldn't help but sigh with genuine emotion, 'So that is indeed an extraordinary treasure. To have it stolen by someone like that is truly detestable.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'What did that thief look like? Are they still alive?' Li Fan asked."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'If we have enough information, perhaps our Great Qi can help track down this thief.' "</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhong Daogong raised an eyebrow and asked, 'True Immortal Rune?'"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan shook his head, 'No. It is a protective immortal artifact, combined with formation power. In short, it's hard to explain.' "</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although Li Fan's explanation was vague, the power of [Creation] he previously displayed had already proven the foundation of the [Great Qi] civilization. Therefore, Li Fan's words did not arouse suspicion among the Immortal Boat elders."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"After all, Li Fan didn't guarantee anything, merely stating it was 'perhaps possible.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat elders conferred amongst themselves, and to avoid arousing Li Fan's suspicion, they still revealed the appearance of the thief from back then. As expected, it was the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, the recorded image left by the Immortal Boat differed slightly from the Dharma Transmission Li Fan had seen in his previous life."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"His expression was more lively, as if they were two different people."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-337" class="calibre1">Chapter 1322: Divine Tree Hides Immortal Script</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This person's face is full of compassion, not like a treacherous villain," Li Fan commented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Dao Sheng snort, "Our Immortal Boat thought the same at the time. So, you can judge a person by their face but not their heart!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong then asked, "Can you track him based on his appearance alone? Do you need to supplement it with other methods?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If he had a personal token, that would be best. If not..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's fine," Li Fan said with a confident air regarding the "Great Qi Immortal Artifact," "His appearance and life experiences are enough to deduce and track him."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it will take time for me to return to Great Qi and report the information."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words caused some minor disagreements among the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Dao Sheng said, "In fact, it is not imperative that we kill this person. The Great Qi civilization's research on True Immortal script characters is no less than that of the Immortal Boat. If we can use this opportunity to maintain contact and exchange information, it might not be a bad thing for our Immortal Boat."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Dao Sheng's words were met with approval by several elders: "That's right. We intended to eliminate him earlier because we were worried about the leakage of the True Immortal script characters researched by the Immortal Boat. But from the current situation, the research of this Great Qi civilization has many commonalities with the Immortal Boat. And unlike us, they do not guard their heritage so strictly..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, from this person's words, the cultivation world where the Great Qi civilization is located is not small and lacks resources. Elders, don't forget the Immortal Boat's core business! Trading across realms, penetrating the universe &ndash; this has always been the creed of the Immortal Boat. Killing him is of no benefit. If we befriend him, perhaps we can escape the current predicament of the Immortal Boat!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't forget that plan! The more True Immortal script characters are collected, the better. Originally, according to our Immortal Boat's collection progress, it might take hundreds of years to complete. But if we can get the supplement from the Great Qi civilization, perhaps the goal is within reach!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">What the elders said was reasonable and logical. Gradually, the elders who were initially determined to kill Li Fan afterward began to hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, weighing the pros and cons was essential for the Immortal Boat to progress further. Sticking to the old ways and refusing to adapt would only lead the Immortal Boat to ruin. This was a lesson the Profound Immortal Boat had learned through numerous calamities to survive to this day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ultimately, it was Zhong Daogong who made the final decision and unified their opinions: "Let's first see the power of that True Immortal script character."</p>
<p class="calibre2">While the Immortal Boat elders were deliberating, Li Fan had already completed his selection in the secret vault.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were the three items he was interested in: the Bronze Immortal Crane, the Seven-Colored Flowing Light, and the Hanging-Head Puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Daoist friend, are you certain about these items? Once selected, they cannot be changed,” Zhong Daogong swept his gaze over them and asked with a smile, reminding him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong then joined forces with the other elders, performing incantations in the void and summoning a piece of white paper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The [Severed Immortal Arm] from the Hundred Hearing Immortal Record was controlled, and an imprint of the arm was placed on the white paper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The blank paper was instantly dyed black with ink.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three profound patterns were formed, extremely similar to True Immortal script characters, but cruder. The shapes of the patterns also bore the characteristics of the three items.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, Li Fan noticed that the three items he had chosen from the secret vault vanished into thin air after a fluctuation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if they were engraved on the white paper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong waved his large sleeve, rolling up the completed imprint and holding it in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked at Li Fan and said, "The items Daoist friend needs are here. After the transaction is complete, I will hand them over!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Good! straightforward!" Li Fan's eyes showed appreciation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to display the complete version after seeing the True Immortal script of the Immortal Boat. But now it seems, letting you feast your eyes first is also fine," Li Fan said, his tone even containing a hint of excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Both of us are researchers of True Immortal script characters. Witnessing this magnificent script, I believe our inner excitement will be the same. As the saying goes, 'When one hears the Dao in the morning, one can die in the evening!'”</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It might be difficult to unleash its full potential within the Immortal Boat. Shall we go to the void outside?" Li Fan asked, eager to begin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How could the elders of the Immortal Boat, who had finally tricked Li Fan into their Immortal Boat, let the tiger escape back into the mountains?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong waved his hand, "We can use the [Myriad Laws] here. Don't worry, this secret vault's Severed Immortal Arm has merged with countless incomplete characters. Under their mutual restraint, the influence of the True Immortal script can be minimized."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked somewhat disappointed, "I was hoping to display my skills in front of everyone..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong formed another incantation, and the Severed Immortal Arm exploded in front of everyone. It transformed into countless incomplete character structures, like tadpoles swimming, sealing off all directions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Forming a True Immortal script cage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, you may begin."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Zhong Daogong spoke, all the elders of the Immortal Boat focused their gazes entirely on Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan coughed lightly, his expression solemn. "Elders, let me reiterate, the True Immortal script characters I am about to depict are derived from my own comprehension and memory. Compared to the original version from the Immortal Realm, and even the one from the Great Qi Immortal Artifact's memory, there are still some deviations..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, please rest assured, my skill is top-notch throughout the entire Great Qi. I will not disappoint you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">After saying a lot of nonsense, raising everyone's anticipation to its peak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan finally unfolded the scene of the endless green fields filled with surging arc light once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As light and shadow shifted, an extremely mysterious character officially appeared before everyone's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment [Creation] descended into the world, the characters constantly drifting within the surrounding cage instantly **flew wildly**.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many directly flew out of the cage's structure and converged towards the central shining [Creation] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it was just a phantom of light and shadow, it still caused the True Immortal script fragments to go mad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Severed Immortal Arm spontaneously disintegrated, and the elders of the Immortal Boat had to divert some of their attention to maintain its stability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But in reality, like these characters, the attention of the elders of the Immortal Boat was completely focused on the [Creation] character!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected, he didn't lie. This single character is worth more than all of them combined!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"[Creation]... it's actually [Creation]!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat is saved!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, having spent half their lives researching True Immortal script characters, had exceptional comprehension. Upon seeing the true face of [Creation], they all quickly discerned its meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of them exclaimed in shock, without exception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The so-called composure and schemes were all illusions in the face of the Great Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While the elders of the Immortal Boat were completely engrossed, Li Fan quietly observed and analyzed the guardian of the Immortal Boat's secret vault, the Severed Immortal Arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had to be said that the method of integrating all treasures into incomplete characters for anti-theft was indeed ingenious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with Li Fan's multi-life experience, extraordinary knowledge, and the Ultimate Separation Disc, he couldn't find a suitable method to break it for the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as the [Creation] character's revelation caused the characters that formed the Severed Immortal Arm to disintegrate and converge towards [Creation], it allowed him to glimpse</p>
<p class="calibre2">the specific structural composition of the Severed Immortal Arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It will be difficult to completely shatter this severed arm instantly. However, it should be possible to seize some key items." Li Fan inwardly felt and deduced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The True Immortal script character [Creation] was truly mysterious and profound, not something that could be comprehended in a single day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were lost in their contemplation.Seeing Li Fan waiting quietly by the side, they did not pay much attention to him. This gave Li Fan ample time to decipher the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record].</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This one, this one, and this one, I should take them all later..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan naturally saw the killing intent hidden by the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan himself did not have good intentions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taking advantage of the chaos caused by [Creation] in the secret vault, Li Fan had already quietly laid down his plundering technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the same incomplete True Immortal script characters, using deception to blend into the Severed Immortal Arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The longer the elders of the Immortal Boat were engrossed in comprehending [Creation], the more enriched the hidden hand Li Fan planted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The more items he could plunder later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I won't make a move just yet." Li Fan narrowed his eyes, his hands moving non-stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a flash, thirty days had passed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong was the first to emerge from his comprehension, looking somewhat dazed, then heaved a long sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He then bowed to Li Fan, "Thank you, Daoist friend!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To personally witness [Creation] is a blessing from heaven! Without Daoist friend's favor, I fear I would never have had such an opportunity in this lifetime!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan accepted the thanks calmly and waved his hand, "It's just a transaction!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong shook his head, "Mortal objects, how can they compare to [Creation]? This time, our Immortal Boat has gained an immense advantage!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan laughed heartily and said nothing more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also gradually emerged from their enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They all bowed slightly to Li Fan first, then their gazes intersected, and finally, they all fell upon Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The meaning conveyed in their eyes was almost identical.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was, they wanted to see a purer, more complete version of [Creation].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Greed knows no bounds. After witnessing the power of the True Immortal script Li Fan had written, and vaguely experiencing the infinite power contained within the character, their hearts inevitably gave rise to a deeper desire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, what about the [Creation] in the Great Qi's protective realm immortal artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"May we have the honor of seeing it?" Jian Dao Sheng asked very politely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan heard this and put on a pained expression. "Even in our Great Qi, only direct disciples who have passed numerous audits are qualified to glimpse the immortal artifact's true memory. Others learn through layers of transmission..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the expressions of the Immortal Boat elders and said with a smile, "I completely understand your feelings. However, this is just our first transaction. As we interact more in the future, perhaps we can agree to your request to visit."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat had varied expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they privately discussed amongst themselves again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Old Zhong, what do we do now?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We definitely can't kill him! Maintaining contact with Great Qi, in order to obtain a more complete [Creation]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, compared to [Creation], those other True Immortal script characters seem insignificant."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Great Qi can even share [Creation] with outsiders; we the Immortal Boat are truly petty in comparison."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After experiencing the power of [Creation], the attitudes of all the elders of the Immortal Boat had uniformly shifted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw this and had a decision in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to the agreement, from now on, we will lead Daoist friend to see that True Immortal script true writing." He said with a smile to Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This piece, although not as good as the [Creation] Daoist friend displayed, is still a True Immortal's handwriting after all. It should also provide some inspiration to Daoist friend." Zhong Daogong said confidently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh? Then I am indeed looking forward to it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensing the hidden hand he had left in the Severed Immortal Arm, Li Fan smiled in return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He followed the elders of the Immortal Boat and temporarily left the secret vault.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the top of the divine tree all the way to the heart of the divine tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the verdant space, a ruin floated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tens of thousands of branches stretched out from above, spreading to the trunk of the divine tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the ground of the ruin, a True Immortal script was engraved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, due to the obstruction of the divine tree's branches, its full appearance could not be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment Li Fan saw this ruin, his heart stirred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the architectural style of this ruin was very similar to what he had seen before on the Immortal Ruins ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal Realm ruin?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask, feigning surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend has good eyesight." The elders of the Immortal Boat were also surprised that Li Fan could recognize the origin of the ruin. Their evaluation of the Great Qi civilization was elevated once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's right. This ruin is from the upper realm that fell when the immortal path was severed." Zhong Daogong said in a low voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, the news of the severed immortal path had not yet spread throughout the Star Sea. Therefore, no one expected that this abruptly appearing structure was related to the Immortal Realm. It was just that the True Immortal script engraved within it caused a catastrophe."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Our Immortal Boat discovered the source of this catastrophe in the Star Sea ruins ten thousand years later."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat joined forces, formed incantations, and the divine tree branches entwined around the ruin slowly loosened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The true appearance of the True Immortal script was revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that due to the passage of time and the absorption of the divine tree, the energy fluctuations from the script were almost undetectable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But this did not prevent Li Fan from instantly discerning the meaning of this script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">[Ancient].</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ancient..." Li Fan murmured, using his hand as a brush, he attempted to imitate and write it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This ancient script on the ruin seemed very similar to the chaotic character he had seen in the domain of white mist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">True Immortal script characters were descriptions of the Great Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But as long as they were not the manifestation of the Great Dao itself, when written by different people, they would present different characteristics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, having studied True Immortal script characters for many years, could naturally clearly distinguish such characteristics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This ancient character and the chaotic character were written by the same person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the character [Hunger] on the Immortal Ruins ground was not of the same origin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my guess is correct, [Ancient], [Chaos], and the True Immortal script character that caused countless world-ending disasters in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea were all done by the same person. The purpose was to sow chaos in the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And the [Hunger] character in the Immortal Ruins might have been for the True Immortal's enlightenment."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although their original intentions were different, they both led to the destruction of the Star Sea and its complete descent into silence."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the eyes of True Immortals, we cultivators are truly like ants..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Various thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This true writing, although its energy fluctuations have all dissipated, still has its uses."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-338" class="calibre1">At this moment, Li Fan suddenly heard Zhong Daogong say this.Chapter 1322</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This person's face is full of compassion, not like a treacherous villain," Li Fan commented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Dao Sheng snort, "Our Immortal Boat thought the same at the time. So, you can judge a person by their face but not their heart!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong then asked, "Can you track him based on his appearance alone? Do you need to supplement it with other methods?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If he had a personal token, that would be best. If not..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's fine," Li Fan said with a confident air regarding the "Great Qi Immortal Artifact," "His appearance and life experiences are enough to deduce and track him."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it will take time for me to return to Great Qi and report the information."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words caused some minor disagreements among the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Dao Sheng said, "In fact, it is not imperative that we kill this person. The Great Qi civilization's research on True Immortal script characters is no less than that of the Immortal Boat. If we can use this opportunity to maintain contact and exchange information, it might not be a bad thing for our Immortal Boat."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jian Dao Sheng's words were met with approval by several elders: "That's right. We intended to eliminate him earlier because we were worried about the leakage of the True Immortal script characters researched by the Immortal Boat. But from the current situation, the research of this Great Qi civilization has many commonalities with the Immortal Boat. And unlike us, they do not guard their heritage so strictly..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, from this person's words, the cultivation world where the Great Qi civilization is located is not small and lacks resources. Elders, don't forget the Immortal Boat's core business! Trading across realms, penetrating the universe &ndash; this has always been the creed of the Immortal Boat. Killing him is of no benefit. If we befriend him, perhaps we can escape the current predicament of the Immortal Boat!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't forget that plan! The more True Immortal script characters are collected, the better. Originally, according to our Immortal Boat's collection progress, it might take hundreds of years to complete. But if we can get the supplement from the Great Qi civilization, perhaps the goal is within reach!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">What the elders said was reasonable and logical. Gradually, the elders who were initially determined to kill Li Fan afterward began to hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, weighing the pros and cons was essential for the Immortal Boat to progress further. Sticking to the old ways and refusing to adapt would only lead the Immortal Boat to ruin. This was a lesson the Profound Immortal Boat had learned through numerous calamities to survive to this day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ultimately, it was Zhong Daogong who made the final decision and unified their opinions: "Let's first see the power of that True Immortal script character."</p>
<p class="calibre2">While the Immortal Boat elders were deliberating, Li Fan had already completed his selection in the secret vault.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were the three items he was interested in: the Bronze Immortal Crane, the Seven-Colored Flowing Light, and the Hanging-Head Puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Daoist friend, are you certain about these items? Once selected, they cannot be changed,” Zhong Daogong swept his gaze over them and asked with a smile, reminding him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong then joined forces with the other elders, performing incantations in the void and summoning a piece of white paper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The [Severed Immortal Arm] from the Hundred Hearing Immortal Record was controlled, and an imprint of the arm was placed on the white paper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The blank paper was instantly dyed black with ink.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three profound patterns were formed, extremely similar to True Immortal script characters, but cruder. The shapes of the patterns also bore the characteristics of the three items.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, Li Fan noticed that the three items he had chosen from the secret vault vanished into thin air after a fluctuation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if they were engraved on the white paper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong waved his large sleeve, rolling up the completed imprint and holding it in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked at Li Fan and said, "The items Daoist friend needs are here. After the transaction is complete, I will hand them over!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Good! Straightforward!" Li Fan's eyes showed appreciation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originally, I planned to display the complete version after seeing the True Immortal script of the Immortal Boat. But now it seems, letting you feast your eyes first is also fine," Li Fan said, his tone even containing a hint of excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Both of us are researchers of True Immortal script characters. Witnessing this magnificent script, I believe our inner excitement will be the same. As the saying goes, 'When one hears the Dao in the morning, one can die in the evening!'"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It might be difficult to unleash its full potential within the Immortal Boat. Shall we go to the void outside?" Li Fan asked, eager to begin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How could the elders of the Immortal Boat, who had finally tricked Li Fan into their Immortal Boat, let the tiger escape back into the mountains?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong waved his hand, "We can use the [Myriad Laws] here. Don't worry, this secret vault's Severed Immortal Arm has merged with countless incomplete characters. Under their mutual restraint, the influence of the True Immortal script can be minimized."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked somewhat disappointed, "I was hoping to display my skills in front of everyone..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong formed another incantation, and the Severed Immortal Arm exploded in front of everyone. It transformed into countless incomplete character structures, like tadpoles swimming, sealing off all directions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Forming a True Immortal script cage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, you may begin."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Zhong Daogong spoke, all the elders of the Immortal Boat focused their gazes entirely on Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan coughed lightly, his expression solemn. "Elders, let me reiterate, the True Immortal script characters I am about to depict are derived from my own comprehension and memory. Compared to the original version from the Immortal Realm, and even the one from the Great Qi Immortal Artifact's memory, there are still some deviations..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, please rest assured, my skill is top-notch throughout the entire Great Qi. I will not disappoint you!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">After saying a lot of nonsense, raising everyone's anticipation to its peak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan finally unfolded the scene of the endless green fields filled with surging arc light once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As light and shadow shifted, an extremely mysterious character officially appeared before everyone's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment [Creation] descended into the world, the characters constantly drifting within the surrounding cage instantly **flew wildly**.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many directly flew out of the cage's structure and converged towards the central shining [Creation] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it was just a phantom of light and shadow, it still caused the True Immortal script fragments to go mad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Severed Immortal Arm spontaneously disintegrated, and the elders of the Immortal Boat had to divert some of their attention to maintain its stability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But in reality, like these characters, the attention of the elders of the Immortal Boat was completely focused on the [Creation] character!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected, he didn't lie. This single character is worth more than all of them combined!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"[Creation]... it's actually [Creation]!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat is saved!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat, having spent half their lives researching True Immortal script characters, had exceptional comprehension. Upon seeing the true face of [Creation], they all quickly discerned its meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of them exclaimed in shock, without exception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The so-called composure and schemes were all illusions in the face of the Great Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While the elders of the Immortal Boat were completely engrossed, Li Fan quietly observed and analyzed the guardian of the Immortal Boat's secret vault, the Severed Immortal Arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had to be said that the method of integrating all treasures into incomplete characters for anti-theft was indeed ingenious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with Li Fan's multi-life experience, extraordinary knowledge, and the Ultimate Separation Disc, he couldn't find a suitable method to break it for the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as the [Creation] character's revelation caused the characters that formed the Severed Immortal Arm to disintegrate and converge towards [Creation], it allowed him to glimpse</p>
<p class="calibre2">the specific structural composition of the Severed Immortal Arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It will be difficult to completely shatter this severed arm instantly. However, it should be possible to seize some key items." Li Fan inwardly felt and deduced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The True Immortal script character [Creation] was truly mysterious and profound, not something that could be comprehended in a single day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were lost in their contemplation. Seeing Li Fan waiting quietly by the side, they did not pay much attention to him. This gave Li Fan ample time to decipher the [Hundred Hearing Immortal Record].</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This one, this one, and this one, I should take them all later..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan naturally saw the killing intent hidden by the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan himself did not have good intentions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taking advantage of the chaos caused by [Creation] in the secret vault, Li Fan had already quietly laid down his plundering technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the same incomplete True Immortal script characters, using deception to blend into the Severed Immortal Arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The longer the elders of the Immortal Boat were engrossed in comprehending [Creation], the more enriched the hidden hand Li Fan planted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The more items he could plunder later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I won't make a move just yet." Li Fan narrowed his eyes, his hands moving non-stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a flash, thirty days had passed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong was the first to emerge from his comprehension, looking somewhat dazed, then heaved a long sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He then bowed to Li Fan, "Thank you, Daoist friend!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To personally witness [Creation] is a blessing from heaven! Without Daoist friend's favor, I fear I would never have had such an opportunity in this lifetime!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan accepted the thanks calmly and waved his hand, "It's just a transaction!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong shook his head, "Mortal objects, how can they compare to [Creation]? This time, our Immortal Boat has gained an immense advantage!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan laughed heartily and said nothing more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also gradually emerged from their enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They all bowed slightly to Li Fan first, then their gazes intersected, and finally, they all fell upon Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The meaning conveyed in their eyes was almost identical.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was, they wanted to see a purer, more complete version of [Creation].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Greed knows no bounds. After witnessing the power of the True Immortal script Li Fan had written, and vaguely experiencing the infinite power contained within the character, their hearts inevitably gave rise to a deeper desire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, what about the [Creation] in the Great Qi's protective realm immortal artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"May we have the honor of seeing it?" Jian Dao Sheng asked very politely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan heard this and put on a pained expression. "Even in our Great Qi, only direct disciples who have passed numerous audits are qualified to glimpse the immortal artifact's true memory. Others learn through layers of transmission..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the expressions of the Immortal Boat elders and said with a smile, "I completely understand your feelings. However, this is just our first transaction. As we interact more in the future, perhaps we can agree to your request to visit."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat had varied expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they privately discussed amongst themselves again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Old Zhong, what do we do now?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We definitely can't kill him! Maintaining contact with Great Qi, in order to obtain a more complete [Creation]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, compared to [Creation], those other True Immortal script characters seem insignificant."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Great Qi can even share [Creation] with outsiders; we the Immortal Boat are truly petty in comparison."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After experiencing the power of [Creation], the attitudes of all the elders of the Immortal Boat had uniformly shifted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong saw this and had a decision in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to the agreement, from now on, we will lead Daoist friend to see that True Immortal script true writing." He said with a smile to Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This piece, although not as good as the [Creation] Daoist friend displayed, is still a True Immortal's handwriting after all. It should also provide some inspiration to Daoist friend." Zhong Daogong said confidently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh? Then I am indeed looking forward to it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensing the hidden hand he had left in the Severed Immortal Arm, Li Fan smiled in return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He followed the elders of the Immortal Boat and temporarily left the secret vault.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the top of the divine tree all the way to the heart of the divine tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the verdant space, a ruin floated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tens of thousands of branches stretched out from above, spreading to the trunk of the divine tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the ground of the ruin, a True Immortal script was engraved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, due to the obstruction of the divine tree's branches, its full appearance could not be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment Li Fan saw this ruin, his heart stirred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the architectural style of this ruin was very similar to what he had seen before on the Immortal Ruins ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal Realm ruin?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask, feigning surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend has good eyesight." The elders of the Immortal Boat were also surprised that Li Fan could recognize the origin of the ruin. Their evaluation of the Great Qi civilization was elevated once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's right. This ruin is from the upper realm that fell when the immortal path was severed." Zhong Daogong said in a low voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, the news of the severed immortal path had not yet spread throughout the Star Sea. Therefore, no one expected that this abruptly appearing structure was related to the Immortal Realm. It was just that the True Immortal script engraved within it caused a catastrophe."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Our Immortal Boat discovered the source of this catastrophe in the Star Sea ruins ten thousand years later."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat joined forces, formed incantations, and the divine tree branches entwined around the ruin slowly loosened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The true appearance of the True Immortal script was revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that due to the passage of time and the absorption of the divine tree, the energy fluctuations from the script were almost undetectable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But this did not prevent Li Fan from instantly discerning the meaning of this script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">[Ancient].</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ancient..." Li Fan murmured, using his hand as a brush, he attempted to imitate and write it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This ancient script on the ruin seemed very similar to the chaotic character he had seen in the domain of white mist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">True Immortal script characters were descriptions of the Great Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But as long as they were not the manifestation of the Great Dao itself, when written by different people, they would present different characteristics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, having studied True Immortal script characters for many years, could naturally clearly distinguish such characteristics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This ancient character and the chaotic character were written by the same person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the character [Hunger] on the Immortal Ruins ground was not of the same origin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my guess is correct, [Ancient], [Chaos], and the True Immortal script character that caused countless world-ending disasters in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea were all done by the same person. The purpose was to sow chaos in the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And the [Hunger] character in the Immortal Ruins might have been for the True Immortal's enlightenment."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although their original intentions were different, they both led to the destruction of the Star Sea and its complete descent into silence."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the eyes of True Immortals, we cultivators are truly like ants..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Various thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This true writing, although its energy fluctuations have all dissipated, still has its uses."</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan suddenly heard Zhong Daogong say this.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-339" class="calibre1">Chapter 1323: Reversing Entropy Returns to Youth</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh? I'd be happy to hear more," Li Fan said, his expression solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, can you discern the miraculous function of this rune, [Ancient]?" Zhong Daogong posed a question, leaving him to guess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pondered for a moment, his fingers tracing lightly in the void. "Ancient signifies the past, the old."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"...Time reversal?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Observing the mysterious rune on the ground of the ruins, Li Fan savored it, his eyes gleaming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong clapped his hands in praise, "Daoist friend's comprehension is truly extraordinary! It takes our Immortal Boat elders several days at the very least to gain some insight from it. I did not expect you to grasp its essence with just a glance!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, describing its power as 'time reversal' might be slightly inaccurate. It is more akin to things reverting to their primordial state..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded slightly as he listened to the explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the [Ancient] rune was at its peak, within its sphere of influence, terrifying calamities would undoubtedly occur. All things would transform towards their past selves. From life to death, turning into dust. Truly, 'ancientness'..." Zhong Daogong waved his hand, and dozens of scenes materialized before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the advent of [Ancient], cultivators, towering ancient trees, the continuous structures on the land, and even the world itself&mdash;all reversed as if time were flowing backward. Ultimately, they all dissolved into microscopic particles, scattered by the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If this original manuscript still contained residual power, even if we were incredibly envious, our Immortal Boat would have no choice but to steer clear and not dare to covter it. But now..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, the Immortal Boat members demonstrated the miraculous use of the True Immortal Rune with actual actions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The eldest among the elders, Jian Daosheng of the Severing Immortal Tower, slowly flew towards the [Ancient] rune.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He did not fly too close, instead hovering in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Zhong Daogong had said, the power of the [Ancient] rune had been exhausted, at least relatively speaking. In fact, there were still faint residual energies on the original manuscript. Compared to its peak potency, it was almost negligible. However, just like the [Separation] rune, when its power was weakened to a suitable level...</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Jian Daosheng remained within the coverage of the [Ancient] rune, the wrinkles on his face gradually receded. Streaks of black began to appear in his white eyebrows and hair. His body straightened, and his spirit became more vigorous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This scene was clearly a process of reversing aging and regaining youth!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were already accustomed to this. Li Fan, however, narrowed his eyes, deep in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He did not wait for the complete reversal to youth. He only stayed within the [Ancient] rune's range for a few breaths before Jian Daosheng gracefully retreated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan understood that this was to prevent himself from being overly influenced by the [Ancient] rune's power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After Jian Daosheng, the other elders of the Immortal Boat also took turns circling the rune manuscript. The duration varied, but all of them visibly grew younger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With the rune present, wouldn't one achieve immortality?" Li Fan exclaimed in amazement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong gave a wry smile, "It's not as simple as it seems. It can only prevent aging, not grant immortality..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He shook his head. "Reversing aging through the [Ancient] rune can indeed increase one's lifespan limit, but the more it's used, the weaker the effect. Eventually, one's lifespan reaches its limit, and it will no longer increase."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, a youthful body is indeed far better than an aging one nearing its end."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the elders of the Immortal Boat finished their turns, Zhong Daogong looked at Li Fan and asked, "Daoist friend, would you like to experience it as well?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan politely declined, "I am only thirty years old, which is the peak of my physical condition. Reverting to childhood would be detrimental."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he spoke, an absolute silence fell within the Divine Tree's space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All the elders stared at Li Fan as if he were a monster.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's expression stiffened, "Daoist friend, are you joking?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Based on Li Fan's own strength and his profound understanding of formations and runes, the Immortal Boat group had already categorized him as a cultivator who had lived for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet now, Li Fan claimed to be only thirty?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was difficult for the Immortal Boat group to accept for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan chuckled, "It's just that I learn things quickly. In my Great Qi, there are indeed geniuses, though few, who are more exceptional than me. You elders need not be so shocked."</p>
<p class="calibre2">His words threw the Immortal Boat group into disarray.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They collectively re-sealed the [Ancient] rune and led Li Fan out of the Divine Tree's interior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, please rest here for now and do not leave. We have some matters to discuss..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the summit of the Immortal Boat, in a pavilion courtyard akin to a mountaintop, Zhong Daogong admonibrushed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, these are the three items Daoist friend selected earlier." After handing over a roll of white paper, Zhong Daogong hastily departed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ignoring the Immortal Boat elders, Li Fan slowly unrolled the white paper in his hand. The three treasures then leaped out from the paper, floating before Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bronze immortal crane and the seven-colored flowing light had already been examined carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan waved his hand, directly collecting and storing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His attention then focused on the mannequin with lowered eyelids.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensing the subtle tremor from [Return to Reality], Li Fan's mind focused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the other two items, the mannequin vanished into thin air after a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this time it was not collected but transformed into an inexplicable energy that was absorbed by [Return to Reality].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stared intently at the [Return to Reality] panel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if tiny currents of electricity flashed, the characters on the [Return to Reality] panel flickered several times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, it returned to a state of calm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's gaze fell on the changed parameter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Void Depletion Charge Progress: 400%."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?" Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Void Depletion Charge Progress was the prerequisite for activating [Return to Reality]'s reversal of everything. Only when the charge reached 100% could it transform reality into void and truth into falsehood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was why Li Fan had always stayed within the Great Profound Minor World after using [Return to Reality], waiting for the charge to complete before venturing out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Previously, the maximum charge progress for Void Depletion was 200%.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The charge exceeding 100% could provide Li Fan with a shield against external attacks at critical moments, ensuring the smooth activation of [Return to Reality].</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as Li Fan's enemies grew stronger, this protective function became rather redundant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The progress depleted too quickly, offering minimal benefit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, this mannequin had directly doubled the charge limit!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, Li Fan sensed that this additional 200% charge, if not consumed in this lifetime, would not disappear with the reset of [Return to Reality].</p>
<p class="calibre2">It would remain within [Return to Reality].</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, he could now perform [Return to Reality] three consecutive times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is interesting."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's mind replayed the image of the mannequin: "The origin of this mannequin is rather peculiar. Being able to replenish 200% of the charge limit is definitely an extraordinary item."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I just don't know if, in the next life, when I encounter this item again and absorb it, the charge limit can still be increased?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">So far, Li Fan had not figured out the specific mechanism for [Return to Reality]'s charge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The unknown catalyst required to activate [Return to Reality] could only be slowly accumulated through the passage of time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, by carefully studying this mannequin, I can unravel this mystery." Li Fan narrowed his eyes, marking this objective.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A 400% charge limit was a significant boon for Li Fan, a formidable layer of protection. More importantly, when encountering existences at or above the level of Faceless True Immortal, Li Fan could use multiple consecutive [Return to Reality] activations to maximize his chances of escaping the threat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise, with only a single use of [Return to Reality], if he were still in mortal danger upon returning to his anchor point, Li Fan would be in a perilous situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From this perspective, the actual life-saving significance of this mannequin was immense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat is indeed my lucky star."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Later, I can also inquire about the origin of this mannequin from them." Li Fan mused inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, Zhong Daogong returned with the elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed their earlier deliberation had reached a consensus, as the hostility Li Fan had sensed from some of them earlier had completely vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, are you satisfied with this transaction?" Zhong Daogong asked first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have gained much. My Master will surely reward me handsomely upon my return. Oh, right, rest assured, I will certainly do my best to investigate the information about that thief for you," Li Fan assured them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heh heh, thank you in advance, Daoist friend."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After exchanging pleasantries, Zhong Daogong changed the subject. "Daoist friend has proven your trustworthiness to the Immortal Boat. After unanimous deliberation by the elders, perhaps we can engage in deeper cooperation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's interest was piqued. "Do you still possess True Immortal script characters that you haven't revealed?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong waved his hand. "Not True Immortal script characters. But they are even more important than True Immortal script characters."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scenery of the surrounding pavilions suddenly shifted, as if they had instantly arrived in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Zhong Daogong moved, the surroundings rapidly changed, passing through the vast Sea of Relics and the Endless Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They arrived at a place of void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This place is..." Li Fan was slightly surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Beneath the High Wall. The foot of the High Wall," Zhong Daogong said with a complex expression and a solemn tone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan surveyed his surroundings, then said, "I have also been to the foot of the High Wall, at the end of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea. The path forward was cut off, yet I saw no actual High Wall..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You display the scene of the High Wall, and for what purpose?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's gaze was profound. "The High Wall stretches endlessly, encircling the entire Star Sea. However, the location our Immortal Boat is currently displaying to Daoist friend is different from other places."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Different? If it's all the same High Wall, what's the difference?" Li Fan's expression turned serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Jian Daosheng who answered Li Fan's question, "This area is arguably the weakest point of the entire High Wall. If there is any place in the Star Sea where one can cross the High Wall, it is here where the chance is greatest!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your homeland must also have many cultivators who are unwilling to be trapped in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea for eternity and wish to escape. If we cooperate, perhaps we can succeed." Zhong Daogong said slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The weakest point of the High Wall... Li Fan stared at the scene presented by the Immortal Boat, repeating the words several times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He did not give an immediate response but instead asked, "How did you determine this? The existence of the High Wall is beyond our current comprehension. It is formless and intangible, unseen. How did you accurately identify its weakest point?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong smiled slightly. "This matter involves the top secrets of the Immortal Boat. Before we confirm our cooperation, please forgive me for not divulging the details."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, Daoist friend can rest assured. This matter is absolutely true. You can report it to your superiors. When you send someone else later, the Immortal Boat can offer a demonstration."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's expression was grave, and after a long period of contemplation, he clasped his hands. "This matter is indeed of great importance and beyond my authority to decide. I will report it to my superiors upon my return. Regardless of the outcome, I will give you a reply."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then we shall await Daoist friend's good news!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the watchful eyes of the elders, Li Fan's light vanished, disappearing into the vast Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is a risky move. If this matter is exposed..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What are we afraid of? Even if someone from this Star Sea were to attack us, would they demand we share the location of the High Wall's weakness? Frankly, it would be better if they did. We are all fish in the same boiling pot; we should unite!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Correct, the Great Qi civilization is superior to us, not weaker. After all, they have survived the Great Calamity and occupy an entire cultivation world. They are a suitable partner for cooperation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And that realm-protecting immortal artifact..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders discussed amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other side, within the phantom of the Wooden Sword, Li Fan was contemplating the information revealed by the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the Immortal Boat did not explicitly state it, based on crucial information obtained in his previous life during his infiltration, it was not difficult to deduce the reason for their knowledge of the High Wall's weakness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In my previous life, Zhong Daogong mentioned that the reason the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat split into two was that a faction within decided to crash into the High Wall as a means of escaping the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And they succeeded in the end."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This weakest point of the High Wall might be the location where the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat impacted the wall. Due to the mutual sensing between the Profound and Merchant Immortal Boats, the Profound Immortal Boat was able to determine the exact location..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the Immortal Boat elders had not revealed this matter, Li Fan would have activated the hidden hand within the [Hundred Hearings Immortal Record] the moment he left, plundering all its treasures.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, since the Immortal Boat still had secrets to uncover, Li Fan decided to wait a bit longer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat's persistent pursuit of True Immortal script characters, besides the innate power of the characters themselves, might be related to this plan for escaping the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Crashing into the High Wall..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I wonder how the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat managed it back then." Li Fan mused inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the phantom of the Wooden Sword, Yin Shangren was resting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others were still traversing the Remnant Realm Great Wall, searching for suitable world fragments to serve as Xuanhuang's medicinal primers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After Li Fan replenished their supply of [Clear Void Flowing Crystal] again, he did not seek out the Immortal Boat elders. Instead, he returned to the Profound Yellow Realm through the Great Heavenly Abode Array.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Great Profound Minor World.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's figure flashed, appearing beside Ou Shangtian, who was fast asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensing the [Qiankun Ancient Hand] still gestating within him, Li Fan used his hand as a brush and wrote a character, [Ancient].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Focusing his divine sense, he observed the changes within Ou Shangtian's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His understanding of the [Ancient] rune was still in its nascent stages, and he hadn't injected much spiritual energy, so the power of the [Ancient] character was extremely weak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It barely enveloped Ou Shangtian's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All Done.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-340" class="calibre1">Chapter 1324: Blood Sees True Immortal Memory</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike the scene when interacting with the Immortal Boat elders regarding the Ancient script, the young body of Ou Shangtian did not exhibit any regression. Instead, subtle tremors emanated from the [Kun Qian Bone Hand] hidden within him, absorbing and assimilating the power of the Ancient script. Li Fan was unsure if "absorption and assimilation" was the right description for this process. However, in his perception, the Ancient script and the Kun Qian Bone Hand seemed to resonate, causing the power of the True Immortal script, which should have affected Ou Shangtian's body, to be entirely drawn into the wondrous artifact, the Kun Qian Bone Hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the other wondrous artifact within Ou Shangtian's body, the [Tome of Ten Thousand Deaths], remained completely dormant. Stirred by the power of the [Ancient] script, the Kun Qian Bone Hand underwent a subtle transformation. On its originally bare white bones, hints of dark red flesh began to appear, mere thin lines, almost imperceptible. However, Li Fan, having witnessed the entire process of change, was the first to notice this anomaly. The birth of flesh made the Kun Qian Bone Hand appear even more mystical, as if it had instantly gained sentience and come alive. Without Ou Shangtian's control, its bony fingers trembled slightly on their own.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Uh... hmm..." Ou Shangtian, while in deep slumber, let out a muffled groan. Clearly, the disturbance within him from the wondrous artifact caused him considerable pain. Li Fan placed his hands on Ou Shangtian's head. He then drowsily fell back asleep. A golden light emerged from Li Fan's hand, transforming into a sharp surgical knife. He made a slicing motion toward Ou Shangtian's arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The flesh did not tear; the golden surgical knife directly entered Ou Shangtian's body and arrived beside the Kun Qian Bone Hand. As if sensing the approach of an external enemy, the Kun Qian Bone Hand trembled violently and incessantly. It even seemed to want to break free and escape, disregarding the life of its host.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, how could Li Fan allow it to succeed? Thin lines extended from the golden light knife, transforming into chains that firmly secured the Kun Qian Bone Hand in place. The light and shadow of the small knife flickered and shifted rapidly, scraping off the newly formed flesh on the bone, inch by inch.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sharp, resentful howls seemed to echo in his ears. Li Fan, with an impassive face, used Origin Force Essence to weave a golden net, collecting and sealing all this flesh. Without the influence of the newborn flesh, the Kun Qian Bone Hand returned to its quiet and peaceful state. However, Ou Shangtian appeared as if he had suffered a severe internal injury, his face frighteningly pale.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a casual wave of spiritual energy, Li Fan nourished Ou Shangtian's body. He then took the flesh, curled up within the net of Origin Force Essence and seemingly devoid of life, and flickered away to the area beneath the Dao Discussion Platform.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the Dao Discussion Platform, the phantom of the preacher continued its discourse uninterrupted. Below, within the excavated immense cavity, Li Fan had already begun his research on this flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The appearance of the Kun Qian Bone Hand is exactly the same as the White Bone Vanguard Realm. According to He Dao Zi Miao, the former owner of the Vanguard Realm, the White Bone Vanguard Realm was a replica based on an illustrated booklet he once saw, which recorded the [True Immortal Remains]..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Meaning, this is very likely True Immortal flesh?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes, looking at the dark red tissue within the golden net. Having escaped from True Immortals several times and even witnessed a True Immortal being swallowed whole by a feline creature, Li Fan's awe of True Immortals had long since vanished. In this life, through a fortunate coincidence, the [Return to Reality] charging progress had doubled, allowing him to activate [Return to Reality] three consecutive times. With the assurance of safety, Li Fan began to study this True Immortal flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">First, he conducted a rough analysis of the True Immortal flesh's composition. The Origin Force Essence surgical knife cut off a small piece. Then, golden light continuously rotated, acting like a grinder, shattering this small piece of flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There is no Immortal Spiritual Power," Li Fan thought, not feeling disappointed as it was within his expectations. "The body tissue is separated from the blood. The tissue's activity is clearly inferior to True Immortal blood. This blood seems to contain some kind of special energy..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyes lit up. He extended a wisp of his divine sense, attempting to penetrate the separated blood. To his surprise, the moment his divine sense touched the True Immortal blood, it felt like hitting a scorching hot iron door. He felt dizzy and nauseated, and a large portion of his divine sense was immediately evaporated by the intense heat contained within the blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Huh?" Although it was only a wisp of divine sense, the vibration and burning sensation were synchronously transmitted to Li Fan's main divine sense. His head felt as if he had been struck by a heavy blow, and then a blazing flame erupted in his soul, burning fiercely. The suffering was almost equivalent to soul annihilation. If an ordinary cultivator were caught unprepared, they would likely be reduced to ashes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan was no ordinary person. With the enhancement of the Innate Grandmaster Technique, his soul flowed and regenerated, becoming virtually indestructible. Even though it felt like being in purgatory, Li Fan eventually endured it. With Li Fan's current resilience, even after enduring this round of counterattack from the True Immortal blood, cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and his muscles cramped uncontrollably. The scorching sensation in his soul gradually subsided. Once everything calmed down, Li Fan let out a long sigh, dispelling all discomfort.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The chasm between Immortals and mortals..." "True Immortals are untouchable." This was the feeling Li Fan had after the experience. Even a single drop of blood still demonstrated, in its own way, the insurmountable difference between Immortals and mortals. However... this small warning did not make Li Fan withdraw. Instead, it made him even more interested. The more he was forbidden from looking, the more he wanted to pry. Burning his soul? With the Five Elements Harmonization and the Innate Grandmaster Technique, his soul was indestructible and could withstand the backlash, allowing him to forcibly probe the mysteries within the True Immortal blood. Endless pain? Li Fan, having come this far, had long since learned to disregard it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a slight movement of his heart, he instantly differentiated into myriad strands of divine sense. Like fearless soldiers charging to their deaths, they all surged towards the True Immortal blood within the golden net. Boom! Boom! Boom! The counterattacks from the True Immortal blood continuously echoed in Li Fan's soul, like a giant hammer relentlessly striking. The myriad impacts brought myriad backlashes. Within Li Fan's soul, it felt as if it had instantly ignited, countless sparks spreading and burning fiercely. The pain was indescribable. Even with the Immortal Heart Incantation's assistance and his own overwhelmingly strong willpower, he was on the verge of collapse, barely holding on. Li Fan first glanced at the Return to Reality panel. The charging progress remained at 400%, not decreasing due to the backlash of the True Immortal blood. This indicated that the backlash from a single drop of blood was still not enough to threaten Li Fan's current strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-341" class="calibre1">With safety assured, Li Fan did his best to maintain the Innate Grandmaster Technique, simultaneously focusing his attention on the True Immortal blood that resembled a fiery wall. Under the impact of countless divine senses, its defenses seemed to show faint cracks. The stalemate continued for an unknown duration. Finally, Li Fan broke through the defenses of the True Immortal blood. The backlash vanished out of thin air, and his soul instantly felt clear and cool. A beam of light emerged from the True Immortal blood, enveloping Li Fan's divine sense. Afterward, a segment of light and shadow appeared before him. It was as if it were covered in mist, and all surrounding scenes were indistinct. An enraged voice was heard from a distant, towering figure. It was sporadic, and only the general meaning could be understood: "...Qionglang Star Domain... Yan... guarding..." "...Target found..." "Your subject obeys the order." A low voice emanated from his own body. The light and shadow shifted again. In the next moment, he was already within the Xuanhuang Realm. Standing high above, overlooking the myriad sentient beings within the realm. However, his body's attention seemed not to be on the Xuanhuang Realm below, but rather on the outside of the starry sky. He appeared to be waiting for something. After an unknown amount of time, a beam of light suddenly arrived from beyond the heavens. His gaze immediately locked onto it. But he did not interfere, allowing the beam of light to fall into the Xuanhuang Realm. Only when the light completely dimmed and settled did his figure descend to the mortal world to investigate specifically. "Not yet." "But it's not bad. If it were years ago, ascension would have been possible. What a pity..." The figure seemed accustomed to this outcome, shaking his head with neither joy nor sorrow, and then returned to the Xuanhuang Realm's celestial dome. Silently watching, waiting for the arrival of the next target... The scene abruptly froze, then rapidly faded and dissipated like a vintage photograph. Li Fan jolted back to reality, returning to the present. Although the memories experienced within the True Immortal blood were fleeting, Li Fan felt as if he had lived through dozens of lifetimes. This longevity was also reflected in his physical body. His long hair, which had been flowing freely, had now grown to his waist, interspersed with white strands. His face, palms, and even the skin all over his body had become somewhat wrinkled. Li Fan looked at his age on the Return to Reality panel. His mental age had not changed, but his physiological lifespan limit had been directly reduced to 50 years. He was still thirty years old in spirit, yet his life was nearing its end. "Is this the price of prying into True Immortals?" After attempting to use the Xuanhuang Realm's celestial treasures that increased lifespan and confirming they could not increase this reduced lifespan limit, Li Fan's heart filled with dread. "If it were an ordinary cultivator, they would surely be driven to a desperate situation by this." "Fortunately, I have [Return to Reality]. A 50-year lifespan limit makes little difference to me." "There are still 20 years left in this life, which is enough to complete my plans." Li Fan's mood calmed down, and he couldn't help but recall the scenes he had seen within the True Immortal blood earlier. "The True Immortal who owned this blood should have been ordered to come to Xuanhuang to find a certain target..." "The word 'subject' is quite interesting." "Moreover, that beam of light from beyond the heavens..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes. Combining the information from the ancient immortal formations in the Xuanhuang Realm and the clues obtained from outside the high wall, a guess emerged in Li Fan's mind: "The ancient Xuanhuang Realm was also 'capturing' things." "Unlike the later capture of other cultivation worlds, the target at that time was... 'Humans'?" Li Fan's eyes flickered. "But it's not bad. If it were years ago, ascension would have been possible..." Li Fan repeated the True Immortal's words several times. "The 'light from beyond the heavens' that had the 'potential for ascension' was not the target that True Immortal was waiting for. What exactly is it..." Suddenly, Li Fan, for some unknown reason, began to associate himself with it. Although the True Immortal's memories were vague and from countless years ago, Li Fan inexplicably felt a sense of having narrowly escaped a catastrophe. When he came to his senses, his back was already drenched in cold sweat. This was not due to Li Fan's timidity, but rather a primal fear and relief after realizing the situation in hindsight. "This..." His rapidly beating heart slowly calmed down. Li Fan temporarily left the underground space of the Dao Discussion Platform and flickered back to the sky above the Great Profound Minor World. Boundless clouds obscured the sight of the living beings on the ground. Li Fan savored the premonition he had just experienced. "Although it's hard to believe..." "But a premonition from the depths of my being tells me that years ago, the True Immortal's target in Xuanhuang might actually have been me?!" "Or rather, not me, but [Return to Reality]!" Li Fan closed his eyes, preventing his inner turmoil and shock from being exposed. "[Return to Reality], [Return to Reality]..." As he spoke, the surrounding scenery became illusory and ethereal again. Being isolated from the real world gave Li Fan a slight sense of peace. "[Return to Reality] involves the Great Dao of [True and False] and [Illusion and Reality]." "Wondrous artifacts of heaven and earth, True Immortal script characters, and even the mysterious symbol that created the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate's bloodline, are all partial projections of the Great Dao." "But only [Return to Reality] stands above all else." "It can be said to be almost the embodiment of the Great Dao of [True and False] and [Illusion and Reality] itself..." Li Fan's thoughts churned as he calmly contemplated. "The fact that the True Immortal called himself 'subject' suggests that the towering figure in the memory must have an extraordinary status." "Qionglang Star Domain... Yan..." Li Fan attempted to deduce the possible truth of the matter from the fragmented information. "It appears the Immortal Realm was already facing a crisis at that time." "Yan..." "With the power of a True Immortal, perhaps they could deduce a solution to the Immortal Realm's crisis, which was [Return to Reality]." "That's why they were 'lying in wait' in the Xuanhuang Realm?" "However, for some reason, I arrived here tens of thousands of years too late." ... After breaking free from the True Immortal's memories for a long time, the lingering sense of narrowly escaping death in Li Fan's heart eventually dissipated. With his emotions calmed, Li Fan re-examined his earlier speculation and found it almost absurdly laughable. "What is the truth?" Li Fan, his mood having calmed, flickered from the sky back to the underground. He looked at the remaining True Immortal blood in the golden net, pondering for a long time. "I cannot pry into it further in this life." "I will see in the next life if I can find more clues." "Even if my guess is confirmed, it doesn't matter. After all, the Immortal Realm faced a great calamity, and those True Immortals who wanted to 'hunt' me have already disappeared first!" A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and his state of mind became steady once more. Although he could not further pry into the memories from the True Immortal blood in this life, it did not prevent Li Fan from continuing his research on the True Immortal flesh. "Next, let me see how the True Immortal flesh resists the power of True Immortal script characters." With his Origin Force Essence surgical knife, he cut off a small piece of flesh. Then, golden light continuously rotated, transforming into a grinder, crushing this small piece of flesh.Chapter 1324</h1>

This indicated that the backlash from a single drop of blood was still not enough to threaten Li Fan's current strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With safety assured, Li Fan did his best to maintain the Innate Grandmaster Technique, simultaneously focusing his attention on the True Immortal blood that resembled a fiery wall. Under the impact of countless divine senses, its defenses seemed to show faint cracks. The stalemate continued for an unknown duration. Finally, Li Fan broke through the defenses of the True Immortal blood. The backlash vanished out of thin air, and his soul instantly felt clear and cool. A beam of light emerged from the True Immortal blood, enveloping Li Fan's divine sense. Afterward, a segment of light and shadow appeared before him. It was as if it were covered in mist, and all surrounding scenes were indistinct. An enraged voice was heard from a distant, towering figure. It was sporadic, and only the general meaning could be understood: "...Qionglang Star Domain... Yan... guarding..." "...Target found..." "Your subject obeys the order." A low voice emanated from his own body. The light and shadow shifted again. In the next moment, he was already within the Xuanhuang Realm. Standing high above, overlooking the myriad sentient beings within the realm. However, his body's attention seemed not to be on the Xuanhuang Realm below, but rather on the outside of the starry sky. He appeared to be waiting for something. After an unknown amount of time, a beam of light suddenly arrived from beyond the heavens. His gaze immediately locked onto it. But he did not interfere, allowing the beam of light to fall into the Xuanhuang Realm. Only when the light completely dimmed and settled did his figure descend to the mortal world to investigate specifically. "Not yet." "But it's not bad. If it were years ago, ascension would have been possible. What a pity..." The figure seemed accustomed to this outcome, shaking his head with neither joy nor sorrow, and then returned to the Xuanhuang Realm's celestial dome. Silently watching, waiting for the arrival of the next target... The scene abruptly froze, then rapidly faded and dissipated like a vintage photograph. Li Fan jolted back to reality, returning to the present. Although the memories experienced within the True Immortal blood were fleeting, Li Fan felt as if he had lived through dozens of lifetimes. This longevity was also reflected in his physical body. His long hair, which had been flowing freely, had now grown to his waist, interspersed with white strands. His face, palms, and even the skin all over his body had become somewhat wrinkled. Li Fan looked at his age on the Return to Reality panel. His mental age had not changed, but his physiological lifespan limit had been directly reduced to 50 years. He was still thirty years old in spirit, yet his life was nearing its end. "Is this the price of prying into True Immortals?" After attempting to use the Xuanhuang Realm's celestial treasures that increased lifespan and confirming they could not increase this reduced lifespan limit, Li Fan's heart filled with dread. "If it were an ordinary cultivator, they would surely be driven to a desperate situation by this." "Fortunately, I have [Return to Reality]. A 50-year lifespan limit makes little difference to me." "There are still 20 years left in this life, which is enough to complete my plans." Li Fan's mood calmed down, and he couldn't help but recall the scenes he had seen within the True Immortal blood earlier. "The True Immortal who owned this blood should have been ordered to come to Xuanhuang to find a certain target..." "The word 'subject' is quite interesting." "Moreover, that beam of light from beyond the heavens..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes. Combining the information from the ancient immortal formations in the Xuanhuang Realm and the clues obtained from outside the high wall, a guess emerged in Li Fan's mind: "The ancient Xuanhuang Realm was also 'capturing' things." "Unlike the later capture of other cultivation worlds, the target at that time was... 'Humans'?" Li Fan's eyes flickered. "But it's not bad. If it were years ago, ascension would have been possible..." Li Fan repeated the True Immortal's words several times. "The 'light from beyond the heavens' that had the 'potential for ascension' was not the target that True Immortal was waiting for. What exactly is it..." Suddenly, Li Fan, for some unknown reason, began to associate himself with it. Although the True Immortal's memories were vague and from countless years ago, Li Fan inexplicably felt a sense of having narrowly escaped a catastrophe. When he came to his senses, his back was already drenched in cold sweat. This was not due to Li Fan's timidity, but rather a primal fear and relief after realizing the situation in hindsight. "This..." His rapidly beating heart slowly calmed down. Li Fan temporarily left the underground space of the Dao Discussion Platform and flickered back to the sky above the Great Profound Minor World. Boundless clouds obscured the sight of the living beings on the ground. Li Fan savored the premonition he had just experienced. "Although it's hard to believe..." "But a premonition from the depths of my being tells me that years ago, the True Immortal's target in Xuanhuang might actually have been me?!" "Or rather, not me, but [Return to Reality]!" Li Fan closed his eyes, preventing his inner turmoil and shock from being exposed. "[Return to Reality], [Return to Reality]..." As he spoke, the surrounding scenery became illusory and ethereal again. Being isolated from the real world gave Li Fan a slight sense of peace. "[Return to Reality] involves the Great Dao of [True and False] and [Illusion and Reality]." "Wondrous artifacts of heaven and earth, True Immortal script characters, and even the mysterious symbol that created the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate's bloodline, are all partial projections of the Great Dao." "But only [Return to Reality] stands above all else." "It can be said to be almost the embodiment of the Great Dao of [True and False] and [Illusion and Reality] itself..." Li Fan's thoughts churned as he calmly contemplated. "The fact that the True Immortal called himself 'subject' suggests that the towering figure in the memory must have an extraordinary status." "Qionglang Star Domain... Yan..." Li Fan attempted to deduce the possible truth of the matter from the fragmented information. "It appears the Immortal Realm was already facing a crisis at that time." "Yan..." "With the power of a True Immortal, perhaps they could deduce a solution to the Immortal Realm's crisis, which was [Return to Reality]." "That's why they were 'lying in wait' in the Xuanhuang Realm?" "However, for some reason, I arrived here tens of thousands of years too late." ... After breaking free from the True Immortal's memories for a long time, the lingering sense of having narrowly escaped death in Li Fan's heart eventually dissipated. With his emotions calmed, Li Fan re-examined his earlier speculation and found it almost absurdly laughable. "What is the truth?" Li Fan, his mood having calmed, flickered from the sky back to the underground. He looked at the remaining True Immortal blood in the golden net, pondering for a long time. "I cannot pry into it further in this life." "I will see in the next life if I can find more clues." "Even if my guess is confirmed, it doesn't matter. After all, the Immortal Realm faced a great calamity, and those True Immortals who wanted to 'hunt' me have already disappeared first!" A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and his state of mind became steady once more. Although he could not further pry into the memories from the True Immortal blood in this life, it did not prevent Li Fan from continuing his research on the True Immortal flesh. "Next, let me see how the True Immortal flesh resists the power of True Immortal script characters." With his Origin Force Essence surgical knife, he cut off a small piece of flesh. Then, golden light continuously rotated, acting like a grinder, shattering this small piece of flesh.</p>

After the array was completed, it would connect the Xuanhuang Realm to the border of the Star Sea. Even without the Emptying the Wooden Sword technique, one could travel back and forth in an instant with the array."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seemed to be a long-distance teleportation formation, but it was not."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Within the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, True Immortal remnant power permeated everything. The Xuanhuang Realm was even situated on the edge of the Immortal Ruins, affected by endless suction, and even space and time seemed to be distorted. A long distance meant too many uncontrollable factors. It was simply impossible to use 'teleportation' to reach the destination."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Horizon Distance Array used the most primitive means of travel. It merely infinitely shortened the distance between the starting point and the destination, so that one could reach it with a single step."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The entire Great Profound Minor World could not accommodate this immense immortal array. Therefore, Li Fan set up the array in the void outside the Great Profound Minor World, on the Xuanhuang Realm side. Then, he laid out a formation to conceal it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"On the Star Sea border side, as Li Fan gradually finished laying out the formation, an extremely profound wave suddenly descended and was about to sweep across the surroundings."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Li Fan pinched his fingers, using a concealment formation to block it off."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The golden light of the array dimmed, and a two-way passage between the Xuanhuang Realm and the Star Sea border was born silently."</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hehehe, fellow Daoist, please don't joke! Beyond the High Wall..." Zhong Daogong's eyes flickered as he directly denied Li Fan's insistent questioning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Do I look like I'm joking?" Li Fan interrupted him rudely. Fierce light appeared in his eyes, and his aura surged, as if he would erupt if they disagreed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat were all too familiar with the fluctuation emanating from Li Fan's body. It belonged to True Immortal script! Seeing that Li Fan seemed serious, the elders of the Immortal Boat paled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, don't be rash. Let's talk this through properly!" They attempted to pacify him while simultaneously distancing themselves from Li Fan and activating the Immortal Boat's multiple layers of defenses.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's expression remained grim, "I am perfectly calm now! I merely wish to seek an explanation!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is precisely because I tried to deduce the source that shook the High Wall that I suffered this backlash and now have so little time left to live... There is absolutely no such terrifying existence within this Utmost Darkness Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It was clearly the work of an unknown civilization beyond the High Wall, yet you Immortal Boat elders feign it as your own achievement. Stealing credit is utterly shameless! You may seek fame and reputation, but you have harmed me..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The more Li Fan spoke, the more agitated he became, and the fluctuations of the True Immortal script on his body grew more intense. He glared at the people of the Immortal Boat as if they were his mortal enemies, ready to fight to the death.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This speech was, in truth, almost unreasonable, lacking any logical basis. But let's not forget, Li Fan, in this incarnation, had only twenty years of lifespan left. For cultivators, twenty years was but a fleeting moment. The Immortal Boat elders naturally would not argue with a dying person in a fit of emotion. They could only placate him helplessly, "Fellow Daoist, you misunderstand us!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We are truly not lying. The source that caused the disturbance of the High Wall, both originates from beyond the High Wall and is closely related to our Immortal Boat; in essence, they share the same origin..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You? Beyond the High Wall?" Li Fan calmed down slightly upon hearing this. However, his eyes remained filled with deep suspicion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat conferred amongst themselves. The matter of the Merchant Immortal Boat breaking through the High Wall was certainly a top secret, but Li Fan was a dying man. They were currently too close to the Profound Immortal Boat. If he were to go mad and release True Immortal script runes indiscriminately, it might cause irreparable damage to the Immortal Boat. It was not impossible to temporarily placate him with secrets.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alas, this matter is complicated. Fellow Daoist, please listen as I slowly explain..." Zhong Daogong began to recount the story of the Profound Merchant Immortal Boat's split and how the Merchant Immortal Boat eventually collided with the High Wall, breaking through it and achieving freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the other elders of the Immortal Boat joined forces, casting spells in the void to quietly isolate the space. On one hand, it was to prevent this absolute secret of the Immortal Boat from leaking, and on the other hand, it was to confine Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan appeared oblivious to their subtle manipulations. The dark and white intertwined hair beside him stirred as if moved by an unseen wind. Whispers of silver-white threads emerged from his hair, weaving a formation in the void before the Immortal Boat elders could react. This formation also confined and sealed the Immortal Boat elders. This act of using their own methods against them did not immediately raise suspicion among the Immortal Boat elders. Attracted by Li Fan's voice, they momentarily turned their attention away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, look! This is the scene related to the High Wall that I saw through the Immortal Artifact that Protects the Realm!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Artifact that Protects the Realm, beyond the High Wall &ndash; these keywords, when combined, could not fail to shake the hearts of the Immortal Boat elders. They all turned their eyes towards Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The perspective soared infinitely upward, revealing the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea. The cold, silent Star Sea, for some unknown reason, seemed to be boiling, with an ominous and terrifying aura echoing endlessly. Soon, the sound of immense roaring came from the edge of the horizon. Then, the Utmost Darkness Star Sea seemed as if a giant stone had been thrown into it, creating colossal waves!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene abruptly ended. Although it was just a brief glimpse, the Immortal Boat elders had already seen what the scene depicted. The High Wall had collapsed, and unknown entities had descended upon the Star Sea! This scene was so lifelike, it was as if it were a recorded documentary! The Immortal Boat elders were mesmerized, unable to shake off the shock of the great upheaval in the Star Sea for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This..." Zhong Daogong also seemed dazed and looked at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now you understand why I suffered this backlash and have so little time left to live?" Li Fan said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The High Wall collapsing, the Star Sea in turmoil. If it truly comes to that, perhaps even Great Qi, with its current strength, cannot protect itself. This is also why we have not made a decision."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Freedom is good, but it must be premised on safety..." Li Fan sighed deeply. The scene fell into silence. The Immortal Boat elders, while outwardly silent, were engaged in a fierce internal debate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is this... true or false?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This scene is definitely not something that cultivators like us could fabricate. Even in our most terrifying nightmares, it is difficult to conjure such a scenario."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I think it's not fake. That fluctuation was too real. To be honest, I almost couldn't resist fleeing just now. It's just that it seems the surroundings were sealed by a formation; I actually couldn't escape."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about our plan? Combining the power of True Immortal script characters, drawing upon the residual Immortal spiritual power of the Star Sea, to form a tsunami that impacts the weak points, and ultimately leap over the High Wall. We've planned for a long time, and now we're thinking of replicating the feat of the Merchant Immortal Boat. Who knew the final outcome would be this? Could it be that in our deductions, the High Wall is not what we thought it was, but rather what we ourselves broke down?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait, I just tried it. This kid's formation is truly formidable. Even the three of us together couldn't break it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A subtle atmosphere gradually spread among the Immortal Boat elders. Firstly, they were deeply shocked by the scene of the Star Sea's great upheaval, and secondly, they were horrified to discover that they had been silently confined by Li Fan's formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this?" Zhong Daogong narrowed his eyes and questioned.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan avoided the question, instead muttering to himself as if possessed, "My Master and the elders, for the sake of Great Qi's safety, abandoned cooperation with you and testing the weak points of the High Wall. I can actually understand..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But if that's the case, then I would have died in vain after twenty years, wouldn't I?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Great Qi intends to give up. What about your Immortal Boat?" Li Fan stared intently at the Immortal Boat elders and asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong was momentarily unsure of Li Fan's state of mind and hesitated to answer. Seeing that he would not get a reply, Li Fan's emotions immediately became agitated again, "What about you all!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If you all give up too, then let everything here be as if it never happened. Then my unauthorized use of the Immortal Artifact, deduction of the future, and the subsequent reduction of my lifespan, would have been meaningless!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I originally had a bright future. Among the young disciples of Great Qi, my talent is unmatched. If not to become a great scholar remembered through the ages, at least I could have become a renowned master like my Master, imparting knowledge and resolving doubts..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"All of this has vanished into smoke because of one sentence from your Immortal Boat," Li Fan's tone became increasingly frantic. Unidentified black marks appeared on his face, making him look terrifying.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Death is death."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If even after death, I become a laughingstock..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I will not agree!" Li Fan pointed his finger at Zhong Daogong.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Give me an answer!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your Immortal Boat, will you continue with the plan, or abandon it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If you are afraid and cancel the plan..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then you can all perish with me!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan spoke, countless silver threads in the surrounding void suddenly lit up. It was as if thousands of suns had risen simultaneously on the horizon, illuminating the space where the Immortal Boat elders were. Every elder's expression was illuminated with frightening clarity. A silver wind blew through the void. Even a gentle gust across their faces left trails of wounds, forcing the Immortal Boat elders to use their defenses. However, as the formless wind in the void intensified, their expressions changed drastically.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This... what kind of formation is this!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Danger! Everyone be careful, this formation's ferocity is unparalleled in my life!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Quickly use the [Release] character to break the formation!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders reacted quickly. Before the words could even fall, Jian Daosheng, the Grand Elder of the Immortal Hub Courtyard, wrote a [Release] character. Under the influence of the True Immortal script's power, the silver-white formation lines instantly collapsed. However, before the Immortal Boat elders could cheer, a shocking scene unfolded. From the surrounding darkness, countless suns seemed to rise again. Even more silver lines than before appeared, forming a new formation. Under the [Release] character, the formation melted like ice, but simultaneously, more ice was being frozen. Thus, the formation that trapped them not only did not disintegrate but became even larger and more complex.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Quick, who else knows the [Release] character, keep up!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Calm down! The Immortal Boat hasn't moved. If too many True Immortal script powers erupt simultaneously, the consequences are unimaginable!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This brat has gone mad! What exactly does he want!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the constant flashing of countless silver threads, Li Fan's voice continued to echo.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhong Daogong! Answer me!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is your Immortal Boat's answer!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's expression was grim. In all his years, he had never been so cornered by a junior, and it was happening now. Yet... Zhong Daogong looked at the different True Immortal script characters constantly emanating from Li Fan's body, his head aching. If these True Immortal script characters were all activated simultaneously within the formation, even they, who had spent most of their lives researching True Immortal script characters, would likely suffer severe injuries. Zhong Daogong finally understood how troublesome a cultivator possessing the power of True Immortal script and fearing nothing could be.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Answer me!" Li Fan's near-maniacal voice echoed within the great formation. Seeing that Li Fan was on the verge of collapse, with True Immortal script characters densely packing the air, causing a chilling sensation. Zhong Daogong, with no other choice, replied, "Fellow Daoist, rest assured, our Immortal Boat will absolutely not abandon the plan to explore beyond the High Wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Words are not proof!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then what does Daoist friend desire?" Faced with the superior situation, Zhong Daogong patiently asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"First, take me to that weak point of the High Wall, and let me see it for myself! If you give up, I will charge towards it alone, even if it means my death!" Li Fan's tone was resolute.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders exchanged glances.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What do you think? Can we break this formation?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Our formation skills are not unknown. Even if we studied it for a hundred years, we might not figure it out. Let alone breaking it in a short time." Elder Meng Xiaomeng of the Immortal Hub Courtyard wore a schadenfreude expression. "I told you long ago not to rely too much on True Immortal script characters. We should also focus on developing other techniques and divine abilities. You just wouldn't listen. Now you're caught in a bind!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What should we do now? Will we really have to take him to that weak point of the High Wall?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not necessarily."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This person is nearing the end of his life and seems to have gone mad. He cannot be judged by normal standards. Perhaps he will really charge towards the High Wall and die."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, don't forget, this person's mastery of True Immortal script characters is profound. Perhaps we can use him for preliminary experiments for the plan."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Exactly. Let's appease him first. As long as we ensure he doesn't leak the secrets to outsiders..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Half coerced by Li Fan's threat to his life, and half out of consideration for their own scheme, the Immortal Boat elders eventually agreed to Li Fan's request. First, they would take him to witness the so-called weak point of the High Wall. The Immortal Boat and its elders, along with the Returning Void Array, moved through the void. They passed through the Sea of Relics, getting closer and closer to the foot of the High Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We're approaching the continuous world fragments ahead." "Beyond that lies the formless High Wall," Zhong Daogong said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan let out a cold snort, "I've been there. How should we proceed from here?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Remnant Realm Great Wall is connected as one. If the Immortal Boat were to follow, it might be captured by that supreme power and find it difficult to escape. Moreover, as you've noticed, the closer we get to the High Wall, the stronger the resonating Star Power becomes. We cultivators can barely maintain our stability, but a large Immortal Boat cannot." Zhong Daogong explained patiently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't worry, now that we're here, we won't go back on our promise."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's gaze swept over everyone. After pondering for a moment, he finally nodded in agreement. Thus, they left six elders to guard the Immortal Boat. The remaining elders then accompanied Li Fan, venturing deeper into the area.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-344" class="calibre1">Chapter 1327: Ascending to the Jade Immortal's Shadow</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding area is endless darkness, and in the distance are desolate, world fragments that stretch beyond sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The tide-like echoing star power continuously intensified, and the speed of Li Fan's group's advance slowed down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The residual True Immortal power gathered beneath the High Wall is even stronger than it was back then," Zhong Daogong murmured, gazing ahead with a heavy tone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Affected by the pervasive echoing star power, not only the bodies exposed to the void but even their divine senses began to scatter like duckweed in the wind, dispersing shortly after leaving the body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Communication among the group still relied on the Immortal Boat's unique [Boundless] transmission method.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although the High Wall is majestic, at this rate, it may indeed collapse one day."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The speed at which the residual power is increasing is faster than we predicted. It seems that even without that brat, we will eventually have to proceed with the wall-jumping plan. Otherwise, if the High Wall collapses, we will have no hope of survival."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even so, being forced like this feels truly unwilling."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hehehe, let's just go with the flow and use him as a guinea pig..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">* * *</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat members were discussing heatedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">[Boundless] was a communication method only known to the core members of the Immortal Boat, so they spoke somewhat recklessly even in front of Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But they never imagined that Li Fan was also proficient in this [Boundless] communication technique. Thus, he heard every word the Immortal Boat elders spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lost in thought, he feigned ignorance of their discussion on the surface.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How... much... longer...?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">He only asked intermittently, looking back with a faint divine sense, urging them on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's answer remained unchanged: "Soon, it's just ahead."</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wasn't that Zhong Daogong was making excuses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was like the saying "running to death while looking at a mountain." The vastness of the Star Sea, here at this frontier, at the foot of the High Wall, was displayed to its fullest. Although they seemed not far from the Remnant Realm Great Wall, after flying for a long time, the path ahead showed no signs of shortening, as if it were endless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only the slight changes in the scenery of the Remnant Realm Great Wall indicated that they were not standing still.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The increasingly powerful echoing star power also became an obstacle to their progress. It was like walking in an endless muddy swamp, with towering mountains in the distance as the goal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Too slow," Li Fan seemed impatient. "At this speed, I'll probably run out of lifespan before we even get there."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong was about to explain, "It's not that we..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he suddenly heard Li Fan say coldly, "Be careful!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A phantom of a long sword, radiating golden light, descended upon them with Li Fan's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sword body depicted mountains and rivers, the sun, moon, and stars, its aura majestic and sacred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In which direction?" Li Fan asked sternly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat members were still immersed in this golden sword phantom, which was clearly extraordinary just by looking at it. Not only because the phantom represented the supreme path of the sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">More importantly, they were horrified to discover that while enveloped by the golden sword phantom, the echoing star power they were subjected to had instantly halved!</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if they were standing on a suddenly elevated piece of land, in another world, no longer being buffeted by the surging waves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How is this possible?!" The Immortal Boat members were all greatly shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The echoing star power was, in essence, residual True Immortal power. Even though it had the word "residual" attached, it was still True Immortal level power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This golden sword phantom could actually reduce its influence, implying it was on par with Immortals!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, the Immortal Boat members dared not think too highly. Even so, Li Fan, who could wield a divine ability capable of confronting True Immortal power, could not help but draw their attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This brat is truly like a treasure trove, full of surprises that are constantly being unearthed."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If we could comprehend this divine ability, perhaps it could open up a second path for our Immortal Boat, besides True Immortal script characters!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No, rather than him as an individual, it's the Great Qi civilization that is unfathomable."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The appearance of the golden sword phantom stirred up a thousand waves with a single stone. The Immortal Boat elders had various expressions, while Li Fan seemed unconcerned, staring at Zhong Daogong, "Quickly point the way. Wielding this [Immortal Slaying Sword] consumes a great deal, and I cannot hold on for long."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the domain of the golden sword phantom, even divine sense transmission became clearer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's eyes flickered upon hearing the words [Immortal Slaying Sword].</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he ultimately pointed the way for Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden sword shone, traversing the Star Sea. Its speed was immeasurably faster than the others flying. The desolate worlds within the Remnant Realm Great Wall rapidly grew larger in their vision. The group drew closer to the foot of the High Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Following Zhong Daogong's guidance, Li Fan controlled the sword phantom and arrived at an abnormal "protrusion" of the Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was like a towering beacon tower on the continuous Great Wall; the number of world fragments accumulated here was significantly more than in other places.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The weak point beneath the High Wall is here?" Li Fan asked, squinting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong shook his head, "Not necessarily. Structures like this actually exist in multiple places along the Remnant Realm Great Wall. They should be important nodes for maintaining its structural stability. To reach our destination, we need to utilize the 'momentum' of this location."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The golden sword phantom stopped, and Zhong Daogong, along with the other Immortal Boat elders, became solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Please Daoist friend, ascend."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders jointly cast spells, and a blurry image appeared before Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flat, slightly curved space was greatly distorted here due to the protrusion of the Remnant Realm Great Wall. Like a tower being pushed up, its potential and energy were significantly higher than in other locations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ascend along the momentum of the Remnant Realm Great Wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong gently pointed, and the image of the spatial protrusion magnified infinitely. In an instant, they were enveloped within it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were already within the time-space anomaly indicated in the image, yet they remained unaware.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stood still, carefully savoring the subtle differences in the surrounding time and space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Back then, our Immortal Boat spent several hundred years just to understand this method of [Climbing]. It's normal for Daoist friend to not understand it immediately."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If it doesn't work, then abandon this golden sword phantom, and we'll fly with our bodies."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders 'kindly' suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan ignored them, closed his eyes, and the scene in his mind flashed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In actuality, he had indeed experienced this feeling of spatial highs and lows before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was in the end of his previous life when the High Wall collapsed, and an unknown entity descended, causing a maelstrom within the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, at that time, he was too shaken by the earth-shattering spectacle and deceived by superficial phenomena.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He hadn't paid attention to the spatial turbulence it caused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"High and low."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The memories in his mind, from illusory, gradually became real. It was as if he had returned to the end of his previous life, witnessing the magnificent, turbulent spectacle of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sudden enlightenment slowly welled up in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The illusion disappeared, and he looked at reality again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The protruding part of the Remnant Realm Great Wall was extremely conspicuous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, hold on tight!" Li Fan said solemnly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sword phantom once again emitted a brilliant golden light. Although it seemed like a great sun in the sky, for some reason, the golden light only shone in this area and did not illuminate a large area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite not having physically moved, the golden sword phantom seemed to have traversed hundreds of millions of miles of space in an instant, becoming decrepit and flickering erratically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's forehead began to bead with cold sweat. His body trembled uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat members watched as the scenery of the Remnant Realm Great Wall, distorted and deformed, appeared to shrink in their vision. They looked at each other with astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How is it possible? They actually completed the climb on the first attempt?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This brat's talent and comprehension are truly rare in the world. He must be a top prodigy in the Great Qi civilization."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To achieve such a feat at such a young age. Give him a few more centuries, and he might truly be able to cross the High Wall! It's no wonder he's become somewhat frantic after his lifespan is nearing its end. If it were me, I wouldn't be able to accept it either!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders looked at Li Fan, and many felt a hint of pity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The climb and transformation were ongoing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The range enveloped by the golden sword phantom was rapidly shrinking, barely covering the Immortal Boat members and Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The once brilliant golden light was also gradually dimming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Clearly, the consumption was even more severe, as if it might extinguish at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the changes it brought were also obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding scenery of the Remnant Realm Great Wall, which stretched to the horizon, slowly curled up and contracted into a circle, closing in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The perspective rose, and the circle became smaller and smaller.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, it converged to a single point.</p>
<p class="calibre2">*Boom! Boom!*</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if they had reached the end of the road, or perhaps hit a wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The last remaining golden sword phantom shattered in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan violently spat out a mouthful of blood, his face deathly pale.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he casually wiped it away, a glint of surprise and madness flashing in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the High Wall?" Li Fan coughed lightly and spat out another large mouthful of blood. He didn't seem to care and turned to ask.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the true foot of the High Wall," Zhong Daogong took a careful look at Li Fan, first shaking his head in denial, then sighing with emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also surveyed their surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We have to climb again?" Li Fan heard this and couldn't help but look up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The High Wall is difficult to overcome, or perhaps impossible to cross. One can only rely on sacrificing oneself to break through it." Jian Daosheng said in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The number of people coming this time is smaller. With just our combined strength, we probably won't be able to reach the impact point from back then. However, the distance should be enough to observe the traces."</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, the Immortal Boat elders formed a circle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, a peculiar energy emerged from them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It didn't surge upward but rose like a tidal wave at the seashore, one wave after another, higher and higher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Carried by this surging force, the scene that had initially shrunk to a small point transformed. The lines below the point thickened and extended downwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders' energy grew more and more vigorous, and the lines became thicker and thicker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like pillars of a heavenly mountain, they gradually became indistinguishable in height, yet they solidly supported those above.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to the continuous ascent, their field of vision also became higher and broader.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gazed into the distance, and in the darkness, he seemed to sense several peaks like theirs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And in the unseen distance, a majestic mountain stood tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its summit was not visible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was only slightly shorter than the endless High Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That is..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"True Immortal of Immortal Ruins?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking back into the distance, a realization welled up in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had learned from the memories of a Xuan Tian Sect Dharma King that Xuan Tian King had once told his disciples that he had found a way to lead the people, and even the entire Xuanhuang Realm, to escape the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it was something that only a True Immortal could accomplish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the difference between Immortals and mortals."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mortals are always at the bottom, and only by ascending to Immortality can one stand at the peak."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The process of cultivation is also a process of climbing step by step. But when a great tribulation descends, even the mountains that could accommodate habitation collapse."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the mountain is gone, the path is hidden. Even if one can fly through the air for a time, one cannot remain in that realm indefinitely."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Borrowing the momentum of the Remnant Realm Great Wall, they had reached a height that was normally impossible to attain. It was like pre-emptively reaching the summit of a collapsed mountain that no longer existed in this era. All sorts of insights that did not belong to this time flooded Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The difference between Immortals and mortals is already this great."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And the High Wall..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan turned his gaze, looking further into the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Majestic and continuous, like a firmament pressing down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He could not see its beginning or end, nor its peaks or valleys.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It simply stood there, blocking their path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Inspiring despair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If he hadn't personally witnessed the High Wall collapse before, Li Fan, upon seeing this magnificent scene, would have been overcome by inner demons. Whenever he thought of the High Wall's existence, he would inevitably feel fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And looking at the expressions of the Immortal Boat elders, it seemed to be the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their initial ambition had vanished. Their faces showed only endless fear and reverence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they seemed to have a secret method among them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As they formed a circle, their minds also united.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, they all awoke from their shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan also feigned to have just "woken up."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We cannot ascend any further."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong sighed, then looked into the distance, seemingly searching for traces left by the Merchant Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan waited patiently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a full half-day, Zhong Daogong pointed in one direction, his expression solemn, "Daoist friend, do you sense the anomaly over there?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan followed Zhong Daogong's gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first glance, it seemed no different from the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But after careful consideration, Li Fan did indeed find some subtle clues.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan extended his hand, as if trying to touch the distant spot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Here... it's distorted."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is this the trace left by the Merchant Immortal Boat's collision?" Li Fan asked with an unreadable tone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He lightly stroked the spatial imprint in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before his eyes, the image of half a magnificent Immortal Boat reappeared, resolutely charging forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, a world-shattering explosion of light erupted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's eyes flashed with a hint of emotion, and he nodded, "The energy released by crossing the High Wall was so immense that even the High Wall itself could not withstand it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, the traces left here have not vanished for ten thousand years."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The imprint is still there. This shows that even after so many years, there has been no sign of 'repair.' Thus, theoretically, we have a great possibility of following the path left by the Merchant Immortal Boat to cross the High Wall again," Zhong Daogong said slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan squinted his eyes, seemingly pondering something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shortly after, he shook his head slightly, "No. We have exerted all our strength to reach this height. And that place..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pointed to the location of the Merchant Immortal Boat's trace and asked, "Perhaps even if we exerted ten times the effort, we still wouldn't be able to reach it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let alone cross the High Wall!"</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-345" class="calibre1">Chapter 1328: Dark Peaks Gather</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There is a distinction between mortals and immortals. Relying solely on ourselves, it is naturally impossible to reach that height. That's why we need to borrow 'external forces.' It was the same for the Immortal Boat of Shang, and it is the same for our Profound Immortal Boat now!" Zhong Daogong said with a slight smile, not explaining in detail, but rather ambiguously.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"External forces? True Immortal script? Is this why you want to join forces with our Great Qi?" Li Fan asked directly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes... and no." Zhong Daogong's expression was inscrutable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alright, since Daoist friend has seen the weak point of the high wall and proven the sincerity of our Immortal Boat. Why don't we return to a safe place and discuss further? This is not a place to linger..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before Zhong Daogong could finish, the high point of the Remnant Realm Great Wall where they were located suddenly trembled slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone couldn't help but look "down." In the Utmost Darkness Star Sea below, for some unknown reason, ripples stirred up waves. Like sea clouds and surging tides, they spread endlessly in the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's the reverberating Star Power!" All the elders of the Immortal Boat's faces paled slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The scale of this outbreak is not small, and it probably won't subside for a while. We should leave as soon as possible," Zhong Daogong said solemnly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked into the distance. Although the distortion of the perspective prevented him from seeing specific things in the Star Sea, Li Fan could vaguely sense the source of the reverberating Star Power outbreak.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if the Remnant Realm Great Wall, which served as a breakwater, had formed a gap due to the disappearance of one of the remnant realms. A portion of the residual True Immortal power accumulated beneath the high wall found a vent, pouring down mightily through this loophole.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This kind of event had occurred in his previous life. It was caused by his Saint Embryo avatar destroying the fragments of various remnant realms that the Heavenly Physician had implanted in the Utmost Darkness Abyss within the Xuanhuang Realm, forcing him to replenish the realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But in this life, the fuse had not even been lit. Why then did the Remnant Realm Great Wall become turbulent?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it be that Yin Shangren and the others caused this commotion?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"They wouldn't be so reckless..." A hint of doubt flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While he was pondering, the elders of the Immortal Boat had already brought Li Fan down from the "high place" of the Star Sea. The scenery rapidly changed, and the vast and boundless Utmost Darkness Sea disappeared. The Remnant Realm Great Wall still stood tall, and the previous "ascended view" felt like an illusion. Clearly, ascending was not an easy feat even for the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In a moment, all the elders' breathing became disordered, and beads of sweat dripped from their foreheads. Zhong Daogong's expression was solemn as he looked towards the distant source of the disturbance in the Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he ultimately chose not to investigate and instead organized and urged everyone to leave. On the way back to the Immortal Boat, Li Fan still led the way with his Golden Sword phantom.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, the elders of the Immortal Boat truly experienced how fast this sword shadow was. When everyone reached the location of the Profound Immortal Boat, the reverberating Star Power had not yet affected them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The expressions of the elders as they looked at Li Fan changed even more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, let's first enter the Immortal Boat and then discuss follow-up cooperation plans," Jian Dao Sheng said, pointing to the open gateway of the Immortal Boat, smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unexpectedly, Li Fan resolutely shook his head and refused: "Still no. I'm afraid I have to go back to Great Qi."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders' expressions immediately became somewhat subtle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was fearless, with an arrogant expression: "What? Do you all seem to have objections?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is not what we agreed on before. Daoist friend learned our Immortal Boat's highest secret plan, and now you want to leave..." Zhong Daogong's expression was displeased, and the other elders stared intently at Li Fan, locking onto him with their aura.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph, I think you don't need to waste your efforts. Everyone has seen the 'Sword Immortal's Strike.' If I unleash it, which one of you can stop me?" Li Fan said unhurriedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, the elders could only remain silent. Indeed, it was faster than the spread of residual True Immortal power in the Star Sea. It could even take multiple people along... Such an escape technique truly surpassed their cognition. However, letting Li Fan leave so easily was absolutely impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The atmosphere in the hall grew tense. It was Li Fan who broke the stalemate: "Why must you all be like this? I'm just going back for a short while. I know your concerns, you're afraid I'll leak the weak point of that high wall. There's no need!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I'm going back to try and persuade Great Qi again, to see if they can change their minds. Having witnessed that there really is such a weak point in the high wall, the persuasive power will eventually be much greater. If my master and the others are still unwilling to take the risk, I naturally won't expose this secret. If I'm lucky enough to persuade them..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Anyway, we have to cooperate in the end, so it doesn't matter if it's leaked or not."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"My lifespan is nearing its end. Now, before I die, I have personally witnessed the only opportunity to cross the high wall, so how can I give it up?" Li Fan said earnestly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterward, he cupped his hands. In the midst of the heavy encirclement by the Immortal Boat elders, he directly rode the sword shadow and soared away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Such was the speed that even Zhong Daogong could not react in time; his figure had already vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This kid is really troublesome," Jian Dao Sheng said, stroking his beard with a frown.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's no other way. Possessing True Immortal script, with immortal formations, and his escape techniques are divine and unpredictable. Moreover, his lifespan is nearing its end, and he's not afraid of death... It's best not to make an enemy of such a person."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fortunately, he doesn't have many years left to live. Otherwise, our Immortal Boat might not have peace in the future."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I actually think his words make sense. If Great Qi is unwilling to participate in the plan due to the prophecy of disaster from the World-Protecting Immortal Artifact, then our Immortal Boat is the only one they can rely on. After all, it's obviously unrealistic for him to cross the high wall alone..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While the elders of the Immortal Boat were in discussion, Li Fan had already returned to the border of the Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The reverberating Star Power was like a rising storm, becoming more intense. The wooden sword phantom Li Fan had left behind earlier was like a candle in the wind, precarious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He shot out a ray of golden light, stabilizing it further. Li Fan searched for traces of Qiao Gong and the others nearby, but found none. The secret marks they had agreed to leave along the way while searching for suitable remnant world fragments were all scattered by the reverberating Star Power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"They all lost contact?" Li Fan was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fortunately, the 'Horizon Distance Array' was not severely damaged." Li Fan floated to the side of the great array, reinforced it again, and then gave up the idea of looking for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can only pray for their own good fortune."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With the luck of these few people, just the reverberating Star Power that erupted shouldn't be enough to kill them."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the storm gradually subsides, if they are unharmed, they should naturally return."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Passing through the great array and returning to the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan found that, as expected, some residual True Immortal power had leaked through the great array. After setting up a net of Origin Force essence at the great array to double-seal it, the tremors caused by the reverberating Star Power finally ceased.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Among the few, if anyone is most likely to have caused this Star Sea anomaly, it should be Yin Shangren," Li Fan recalled Yin Shangren's strange expression when he first arrived at the Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"He must have seen the scenes from the memories of the world spirits he absorbed. But Yin Shangren is by no means a reckless person. If it were just that, he wouldn't have recklessly moved remnant realm fragments without regard for the consequences..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The secrets within this should be revealed when Yin Shangren returns," Li Fan had a vague premonition that Yin Shangren was still alive in some corner of the Remnant Realm Great Wall. He might even have encountered a great fortune.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it's related to the formation of the Remnant Realm Great Wall?" Li Fan suddenly thought so. In the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, not only is the origin of the high wall unknown, but even the formation of the Remnant Realm Great Wall beneath it has always been a mystery. The countless destroyed cultivation worlds in the Star Sea back then did not gather at the Immortal Ruins. Instead, they piled up beneath the high wall, forming a continuous expanse. In Li Fan's opinion, the force maintaining the Remnant Realm Great Wall was a great power not inferior to residual True Immortal power, yet it was beyond Li Fan's knowledge. At his current level of experience, which far surpassed ordinary cultivators, and with the unrestrained exploration of each reincarnation, there was little in the Xuanhuang Realm or the Utmost Darkness Star Sea that remained a blind spot for him. This force maintaining the Remnant Realm Great Wall was one such thing. The deepest part of the Utmost Darkness Sea was another.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning to Great Xuan, Li Fan's wisp of divine sense possessed the body of a strong Ghost Tribe member. Then, after gathering the Ghost Tribe members and initiating the ritual to enter the Utmost Darkness Sea, he slowly walked into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Utmost Darkness Sea was endlessly dark. For ordinary cultivators, it was naturally a dangerous land of death. But Li Fan had walked through it countless times, familiar with the way, and traveled without incident.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ignoring the corpse of the ancient immortal from the Xuanhuang Realm lying on the ground, he walked forward with a single-minded focus, arriving at the central core of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array. It was like a transparent observation deck, overlooking the silhouette of the True Immortal's remains in the entire Utmost Darkness Sea. He finally stopped, not daring to go deeper, facing the lurking True Immortal's desire for survival.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before him, the ancient storm clouds that had accumulated for who knows how many years stood quietly, like terrifying and bizarre primordial beasts. Looking down at these accumulated forces from above, Li Fan felt a sense of familiarity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected, my feeling was not wrong!" A sharp glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes. The scene he perceived earlier while overlooking the Utmost Darkness Sea from the high point of the Remnant Realm Great Wall now appeared before him, overlapping with the image of the storm condensing in the Utmost Darkness Sea. It wasn't about specific scenery, but about the convergence of energy, making this part of the Utmost Darkness Sea significantly elevated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This place should be one of the many peaks seen from that high point."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The energy gathered here, compared to the entire Xuanhuang Realm, is even 'higher.' It's even superior to the position reached by borrowing the power of the Remnant Realm Great Wall!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyes flickered, his thoughts racing: "Not only is the 'Spirit Gathering Ascension Array' in the Utmost Darkness Sea established on True Immortal remains, but also because nearly ten thousand years have passed since the array was established!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The establishment of the great array back then was for King Xuan Tian to lead the Xuanhuang Realm across the high wall. However, due to various accidents, King Xuan Tian mysteriously disappeared, and the plan was aborted midway."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But the energy accumulated in the Utmost Darkness Sea did not stop. Instead, it has been continuously accumulating for nearly ten thousand years."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the past ten thousand years, various drastic changes have occurred in the Star Sea. However, in reality, the 'height' of the high wall surrounding the Star Sea has not actually changed. This means..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan scanned the storm clouds below again. The storm clouds before his eyes suddenly turned into peaks, each floating above the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, facing the high wall from afar.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The high points that the Immortal Boat people consider treasures, and can only reach with external help, are abundant in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Standing here, crossing the high wall would be much easier than elsewhere."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The only concern is that it might provoke the True Immortal's survival intent here..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, as long as I'm careful, there should be no problem."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Maintaining the overhead view was somewhat strenuous for Li Fan. He let out a long sigh, restoring himself to a normal state. He began to ponder the correct way to use this wealth left by King Xuan Tian.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Simply using the high points as a springboard is definitely not enough. I need more data. Preferably, actual verification..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat can be used as cannon fodder, which is not bad."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Spirit Gathering Ascension Array is a part of the Star Crossing Array, involving crossing the high wall. The Eye of the Celestial Beast is also like this. It seems that the Eye of the Celestial Beast is not just for navigation and locking..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What it sees might also be the 'height of the high wall,' a dimensional perspective similar to what I saw before!" Li Fan suddenly had a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Controlling the body of the Ghost Tribe member, Li Fan stayed in the main control center of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array for a full seven days. Until the Ghost Tribe member's body could no longer withstand the dense darkness, and was completely consumed by it. His senses disappeared, and he stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Great Profound Minor World, Li Fan slowly opened his eyes. His divine sense swept across the heavens and earth. After getting used to the elevated perspective from before and returning to the normal perspective, Li Fan actually felt slightly unwell.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, breaking through the limit of height could lead to ascension to immortality."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Later, the immortal path was severed, but the high wall still existed..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But perhaps, the principles behind these two are somewhat similar."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the countless beings in the Great Profound, Li Fan felt an inexplicable emotion surge in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, the height of the high wall might be even greater than the height of achieving immortality. After all, King Xuan Tian could ascend to the immortal path back then, but he couldn't cross the high wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To put it another way, if I could cross the high wall now, perhaps I could have ascended to immortality in the past."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but be lost in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal..." Ten thousand years have passed, times have changed. Although the realm is the same, one is achieving the Dao and ascending, while the other is locked behind the high wall. Even if one can cross, they still have to face the unknown risks beyond the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Great Dao is easier to comprehend, but immortality is not immortality." Li Fan could only sigh with such emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my guess is correct, the method of building the high wall is the same as the shackles of achieving ascension, then things are interesting."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-346" class="calibre1">Chapter 1329: Finger Falls, Destroying the Firmament</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Regarding the formation of the high wall, Li Fan has had two hypotheses.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One possibility is that the high wall was created by a True Immortal who achieved enlightenment within the Immortal Ruins, similar to a prohibition set up by cultivators when meditating to prevent others from disturbing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other possibility is that the high wall was built by unknown entities from beyond the wall, sealing the Star Sea to isolate the disaster of True Immortal script that was spreading at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Both hypotheses have a certain degree of validity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The high wall is formless and intangible, yet it can seal the entire Star Sea. It is a technique that mortal cultivators cannot comprehend at all, and only those at the level of "Immortal" can achieve it. Although the Utmost Darkness Star Sea is vast in the eyes of cultivators in the lower realms, containing countless cultivation worlds, True Immortals can see its entirety with a single glance. This casually drawn, sealed area might be of a suitable scale for Immortals to practice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, the Star Sea is vast and boundless. The Utmost Darkness Star Sea is certainly not the entirety of the lower realms. Perhaps it's not even a corner of the lower realms. After the great calamity of the Immortal Realm, the region where the Xuanhuang Realm is located had King Xuan Tian return after ascending to immortality, and the Faceless Immortal escaped from it. Outside the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, are there no other survivors of the Immortal Realm? It is highly possible that they took preventive measures after discovering the anomaly in the Xuanhuang Realm star field.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Realm collapsed, and the vast lower realms instead became a battlefield for various forces to gather. What does the scene outside the high wall look like now?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Are those surviving Immortals still in control? Or have past cultivators fought back and found a way to counter True Immortals? Or even developed civilizations capable of hunting True Immortals?" Li Fan mused leisurely, a sense of longing appearing in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His emotions surged, and he couldn't calm down for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Soon. In this life, with the Profound Immortal Boat taking the lead in crossing the high wall, even if they ultimately fail, I will learn from them and continue in the next life. It will take at most three to five tries before there's a good chance of crossing the high wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And after I achieve Dao Integration by merging with the Heavenly Immortal Souls of the Super Xuanhuang Realm and become the strongest in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, I can also unify the powers of the Xuanhuang Realm and the Immortal Boat to the greatest extent, and begin exploring beyond the high wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just like how I explored the Sea of Clouds and the Xuanhuang Realm step by step from the Great Profound Minor World!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In a slight trance, the scene of him struggling desperately to break through the Immortal Severing Great Array and arriving in the cultivation world in his previous life suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although it is dangerous outside the high wall, I am not what I used to be."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyes flickered. "Inferiority and superiority... Looking down at the Star Sea below the high wall from an elevated perspective, the enlightenment that arose in his heart was dozens of times more active than comprehending the Dao in the Star Sea. Moreover, what was naturally understood while standing at the peak was a level higher than in normal circumstances. It was as if he was comprehending the Dao from the 'True Immortal's perspective'!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Why are all beings below Immortals ants?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A True Immortal can destroy the Xuanhuang Realm with a single glance. However, even a mortal cultivator, no matter how strong, would take considerable effort to destroy such a vast world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's because Immortals stand tall enough. In the eyes of True Immortals, a mere realm is just a small point!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Recalling the scene he saw at the peak of the Remnant Realm Great Wall earlier. The continuous remnant realm fragments, as the height increased, gradually shrunk and then twisted into rings, finally converging into a single point. Compared to the behemoth of the Remnant Realm Great Wall, the current Xuanhuang Realm was just an insignificant fragment. The Great Wall turning into a point. And regarding the Xuanhuang Realm as a point, without even needing to ascend to that height. Recalling the feeling of constantly climbing, in Li Fan's eyes, the Great Profound Minor World and the Xuanhuang Realm, in the distortion, slowly shrank. Although it had not yet reached the point of converging into one, it was as if it were being viewed from outside the realm, turning into a ball of yellow smoke. Li Fan instinctively wanted to reach out and touch it, but found himself as if frozen in ice. There was immense resistance around him, and he couldn't move at all!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am still too weak now! Although by chance, I have gained the True Immortal's perspective, the vision and actual actions are two completely different concepts..." Li Fan tried several times, but the result was the same. His body seemed to be outside the world, and he couldn't make any effective manipulations. Furthermore, because of these few attempts, the energy within him was rapidly depleted. Even with Li Fan's current foundation, it was stretched thin and quickly left him nearly exhausted. Li Fan knew he couldn't force it and quickly fell from the high place. When his vision lowered, his movements became flexible again. Li Fan let out a long sigh, recovering from his recent exhaustion. After a moment, his gaze condensed slightly. He found something peculiar. According to the normal recovery speed, he should have been fully recovered within a few breaths. After all, he had the Five Elements Great Grotto-heaven as a foundation, coupled with the absorption of the Xuanhuang World Destruction phenomenon. The energy that the Xuanhuang Realm could erupt in the face of world-ending crises after the merging of all realms was immense, almost inexhaustible for cultivators. But now, Li Fan, simply by attempting to act at a "high place," had depleted this energy reserve in a short period. "Not only has the altitude changed, but the energy consumption required for normal actions has also increased exponentially." "This is also one of the fundamental reasons for the gap between Immortals and mortals. Spiritual power, even the spiritual power of an entire world, cannot support the energy consumption of acting at a 'high place'." "The energy level is too low; a higher-level substitute is needed." "Immortal Spiritual Power..." Various insights flashed through Li Fan's mind. Taking a step, Li Fan left the Great Profound Minor World and arrived at another barren minor world with no inhabitants, only continuous primeval forests. He quietly waited for his rest to complete, and then Li Fan attempted to ascend again. However, this time, Li Fan controlled the speed of altitude increase. When the primeval forest before his eyes shrank to the size of a glass bead, he stopped. For Li Fan, who was at the lowest point, merely maintaining the "altitude" required consuming a large amount of energy. But this time, he did not choose to use his own spiritual power to fill it. Instead, he chose to use Origin Force essence, which was very close to Immortal Spiritual Power. Golden light enveloped him, and the sense of restraint slightly loosened. Compared to the completely frozen state before, it was much easier. Li Fan looked at the minor world before him, which was like a glass bead, and slowly extended his right index finger. Buzz... As if sensing fatal danger, a mournful dirge-like song suddenly sounded in the sky of the barren minor world. However, it was destined to be unable to prevent everything from happening. Li Fan's finger gently descended. A finger shadow appeared synchronously in the sky above the barren minor world, like rolling dark clouds, obscuring the entire minor world. There was no earth-shattering explosion. With just the light sound of glass shattering, the barren minor world instantly turned to ashes! Violent gusts of wind spread in the void due to the world's destruction. But no matter how they blew, Li Fan stood there unharmed. Protected by golden light, the storm could not harm him in the slightest. He narrowed his eyes, looking at his finger, still immersed in the power of that world-destroying strike. The massive consumption of Origin Force essence had caused him to fall from a "high place" and return to a normal perspective, but so easily destroying a minor world like this truly gave Li Fan an illusion of being an supreme deity! Li Fan closed his eyes, and it took him a long time to eliminate this sense of displacement. "Fundamentally, the True Immortal's single glance that destroyed Xuanhuang back then is no different from what I did now. It's just that he stood higher and could wield more power..." "Given enough time, I can also achieve it." Li Fan gently touched the tip of his right index finger, as if wiping away nonexistent dust. "This move, from top to bottom, is like a True Immortal's descending finger..." "Let's call it the [Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger]!" "It represents both a True Immortal descending to the mortal world, and the power of a True Immortal subjugating the mortal world." "Not bad!" Li Fan was quite pleased with his naming. Sensing the divine senses investigating the area due to the inexplicable destruction of this minor world, Li Fan turned into a sword shadow and left directly. The barren minor world was too small; even if it disappeared, it would not affect the overall stability of the Xuanhuang Realm. Returning to Great Xuan, Li Fan, while savoring the feeling of using the [Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger], pondered how to unleash this divine ability more easily in the future. Although the Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger possessed world-destroying power, its drawbacks were also obvious. The time required to cast it was too long. Just climbing to a certain height required Li Fan to accumulate power for a long time. Then, he had to gather Origin Force essence to act freely at that specific altitude... If the target was a world, it would be fine. After all, a world wouldn't run away, and its position wouldn't change. But if the target was a cultivator, he might not give Li Fan such a long preparation time. "First, use formations to ambush them in advance and trap them, buying me enough time." "Secondly..." Li Fan's current cultivation level, among which the [Formation Dao] was the highest. Now that he had comprehended a near-immortal divine ability but could not unleash it freely, he habitually wanted to find a breakthrough from formations. "All the Great Daos in the world originate from the same source. Divine abilities can be transformed into formations, and formations can be transformed into divine abilities..." Ever since he ascended to the peak, Li Fan felt that his thoughts were unprecedentedly active. The bird's-eye view allowed him to ponder the encountered problems from a perspective beyond the mortal realm. "End Separation Disc, deduce!" Temporarily suspending all other tasks, Li Fan poured all his encounters at the foot of the high wall and the insights from casting the Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger into it. Because the requirement to directly transform this divine ability into a formation clearly exceeded the End Separation Disc's processing capabilities, the End Separation Disc manifested a state of lag by simulating personalities. Seeing this, Li Fan pondered briefly. Then, he changed his strategy. He did not aspire to directly transform the Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger into a corresponding formation. Instead, he transformed the casting steps of the divine ability into successive tiered formations. Just like how several ancient immortal formations ultimately constituted the Xuanhuang Realm's Star Crossing Great Array, Li Fan planned to use several sequential formations to achieve the rapid casting of the Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger. "The first step, naturally, is [Ascending Height]." Li Fan had personally climbed several times and had a preliminary understanding of this process. The so-called ascending height was, in reality, to stimulate energy and elevate its "potential" in this region of the Star Sea. "To find a method to accomplish this, perhaps we need to collect enough residual True Immortal power, just as the Profound Immortal Boat planned, and then use the high wall to concentrate and release it." "However, on one hand, I'm not expecting to overturn the high wall with a single finger now, so the required stimulation energy is not as terrifying as imagined." "On the other hand..." In Li Fan's mind flashed the scene of the peaks gathered in the depths of the Utmost Darkness Sea. "Perhaps we can draw inspiration from the [Spirit Gathering Ascension Array]." Li Fan mused inwardly. "The Spirit Gathering Ascension Array can easily form energy peaks rarely seen in the Utmost Darkness Sea because it is itself built upon True Immortal remains." "If we also use True Immortal remains as the formation material..." Li Fan's thoughts instantly opened. A red light flashed in his hand. It was the remaining True Immortal flesh and blood that had been activated by ancient characters on Ou Shangtian's Kun Qian bone hand. "There is no Immortal Spiritual Power, but it is still True Immortal related, so it should be somewhat helpful, right?" Li Fan muttered, using this mass of True Immortal flesh and blood as raw material to begin the first trial. With the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array as a template, the derivation process of the End Separation Disc was smooth. Soon, a nascent formation took shape. Li Fan used Origin Force essence to set up the formation, mixing in the continuously writhing True Immortal flesh and blood. After a long while, when everything was ready, Li Fan narrowed his eyes, studied it, and activated the formation. A moment of silence followed. Then, an incredibly dazzling pillar of light was born within the formation. Fueled by the True Immortal flesh and blood, the light was dazzling to the extreme. What made Li Fan even more delighted was that in his perspective, this light pillar was not just bright. It was slowly rising, ascending, and surpassing all beings! "It went so smoothly?" The thought had just appeared in his mind when the light pillar, which seemed capable of illuminating the entire sky, suddenly extinguished. Li Fan was stunned at first. After some inspection, he finally realized that there was no problem with the formation. It was simply that the True Immortal flesh and blood used as fuel had been completely consumed. Li Fan frowned slightly: "The utilization rate is still too low." "We can still find ways to improve it." "Also, it's not just Kun Qian's bone hand." "The Xuanhuang Realm should have other True Immortal remains, and perhaps we can collect them all..." The purpose of the Ascension Array was not just to quickly cast the [Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger]. Being able to elevate the current "potential" might play an indispensable role in crossing the high wall in the future, and even in achieving True Immortality. Li Fan attached great importance to this. Temporarily putting aside all other external matters, Li Fan focused all his attention on studying it. With the End Separation Disc's derivation and Li Fan's personal guidance and modification, the Ascension Formation underwent thousands of iterations in just seven days, finally achieving a utilization efficiency of True Immortal flesh and blood that was barely satisfactory to Li Fan.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-347" class="calibre1">Chapter 1330: Immortals Fall, All Things Vanish</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan began a new round of experiments. This time, after the fist-sized True Immortal flesh and blood was burned out, the resulting altitude was sufficient to activate the [Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger], easily crushing a minor world of the same scale as Great Xuan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is estimated that to achieve the effect of destroying Xuanhuang with a single finger, at least True Immortal flesh and blood the size of a whole person would need to be burned..." Li Fan pondered in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Compared to the utilization efficiency of True Immortals, there is still a huge gap. But this is already the limit of what I can do now. Perhaps as my strength increases in the future, I will find more suitable improvement methods."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With the first and most crucial step resolved, the subsequent derivation work proceeded smoothly. The End Separation Disc successfully replicated the Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger divine ability using eight sequential formations. With the assistance of the End Separation Disc, and with all materials complete, Li Fan could complete the formation in an instant, making it a instantaneous divine ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Unfortunately, it is composed of formations after all, not as natural as one's own divine ability. If I were to face an opponent skilled in formations, they might exploit the loopholes between the sequential formations and break this divine ability with ease."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In this Utmost Darkness Star Sea, there should be no one whose formation skills surpass mine. But beyond the high wall, it's hard to say..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Regardless, the priority is to collect enough True Immortal flesh and blood for research, and also to prevent them from developing self-awareness due to their large numbers when they gather."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stood in the void above the Great Profound Minor World, gazing at the world outside, pondering his recent encounters. He had a more profound understanding of promoting the birth of the Super Xuanhuang Realm in this life.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If achieving immortality is a process of a person climbing upwards."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then what I've planned is to push the entire Xuanhuang Realm to ascend to the other side."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyes flickered, his thoughts churning: "Currently, achieving immortality as an individual is already impossible, let alone promoting the sublimation of a world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In fact, if it weren't for the strand of Immortal Spiritual Power left by Mr. Bai, I wouldn't even consider this. It was only after witnessing the changes in the Xuanhuang Realm after it was contaminated with Immortal Spiritual Power in my previous life that I gained some confidence."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Promoting the sublimation of the world might have been what the Heavenly Physician had been planning all along. However, the world he wanted to promote was not Xuanhuang, but the Heavenly Law. But this life is destined to be intercepted by me!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan felt no guilt: "With the Ascension Array, perhaps I can utilize that strand of Immortal Spiritual Power more efficiently. But whether to inject burning True Immortal flesh and blood during the world's sublimation process..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pondered for a moment, and finally decided to find a small world for an experiment first. Although theoretically, after the True Immortal flesh and blood was burned by the formation, nothing would remain, Li Fan still vaguely felt that there might be some changes within that he could not yet discern.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The target minor world chosen this time was even smaller than the barren minor world crushed by a finger before. It had little vegetation, a complete life desert. After using the Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger to sever its connection with the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan dragged it through the void opened by the Rift Cracking Whales.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only when he was completely far from the main Xuanhuang Realm, ensuring that no disaster would affect it even if something happened, did Li Fan finally stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Legend has it that Immortals can pluck stars and capture the moon. My method is not bad."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Using formations instead of divine abilities, casting it felt completely effortless, even appearing somewhat elegant. However, the rapid consumption of True Immortal flesh and blood inevitably made Li Fan feel a pang of heartache.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After this experiment, the inventory will be completely depleted. I'll have to accumulate for a while longer."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the void, Li Fan looked at the minor world below and began to arrange the Ascension Formation throughout the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Besides this, let's also examine the effect of the character [Creation]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to his vigilance against potential Dao-claiming True Immortals, Li Fan had been using the [Creation] character purely as a tool, without attempting to comprehend the profound truths it contained, even after learning about it. In this experiment, Li Fan deliberately distorted its usage. He did not use the fully comprehended form of the [Creation] character.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With all preparations complete, the Ascension Formation was instantly activated. In countless corners of the world, peaks rose like heavenly pillars, lifting the entire world. As the "altitude" climbed, all sorts of wondrous changes occurred in this life desert. Vegetation and trees, as if experiencing millions of years of evolution in the blink of an eye, transformed from a shallow layer covering the surface to towering, continuous primeval forests. The monotonous landscape of the world's surface also began to differentiate and evolve, with majestic natural scenery like high mountains and deep valleys appearing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This change did not occur in cultivators like us."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Until reaching the highest point, the cultivator's body does not change with the increase in altitude. But for the 'world,' it's different."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not a linear increase, but there is indeed feedback at all times."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching the magnificent scenes happening in the world below, Li Fan felt waves of enlightenment surging within him. The world's ascension continued as the True Immortal flesh and blood burned. Clearly, more energy was needed the higher it went. The evolutionary spectacle of the world gradually stalled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It has reached its limit." Li Fan knew this, not expecting the True Immortal flesh and blood provided this time to push the minor world to any significant height. He stared intently below, observing the changes after the "ascension" was completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The True Immortal flesh and blood was completely consumed. The minor world, which had been constantly rumbling, suddenly fell into an eerie silence. It was as if it had been paused. The wind, clouds, air, and even all life within the world were frozen by some unknown force, motionless.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?" Li Fan seemed to sense something, and his expression changed slightly. The wooden sword phantom unsheathed, carrying him rapidly away, escaping the void range where the minor world was located.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after Li Fan left, a terrifying disaster befell that minor world. Cracks erupted from within the world. Initially only three or five, xuyên through heaven and earth. Then the cracks continued to spread, quickly covering every corner of the world. Like falling heavily from a great height.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The minor world, which had been temporarily sublimated by Li Fan's formation power, finally returned to its original position. It instantly shattered into pieces! Unlike the silent destruction by the Nine Heavens Descending Dust Finger, the minor world falling from a great height caused a violent collision with the void where the Xuanhuang Realm was located.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a massive boulder falling into a pool, invisible ripples spread outwards from the point of the minor world's destruction. Like a howling gale, Li Fan's figure remained motionless, but the clothes on his body fluttered wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked back at the Xuanhuang Realm. Although the Xuanhuang Realm itself would not be harmed by this accidental fall, this hurricane did cause the Xuanhuang Realm to shake slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems the 'flies' will be attracted again." Li Fan sensed the approach of Daosmic energy from the Myriad Immortals Alliance, but did not immediately evade. He had not forgotten the main purpose of this experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's divine sense probed the area where the world had fallen. It seemed no wreckage remained. Everything within the minor world had turned to dust in this fall. However, the black energy, which had formed after the True Immortal flesh and blood was decomposed by the white circle to dust, had not vanished with the disappearance of the world. It still floated quietly in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What exactly is this black energy?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Using True Immortal flesh and blood as fuel does indeed cause it to be hidden within the world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having obtained the desired result, Li Fan waved his large hand, and the golden net of Origin Force essence enveloped the black energy, making them flee away from this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Shortly after Li Fan left, a figure arrived late. If Li Fan were still there, he would have recognized this person as the leader of the Dharma Transmitters, Jiang the Dharma Transmitter. Jiang the Dharma Transmitter was stationed in the realm of Gui Xu and rarely went out. He only appeared when the Xuanhuang Realm encountered a world-ending calamity that ordinary Dharma Transmitters could not resolve. This time, it was merely a minor disturbance caused by the fall of a world, yet it inexplicably drew him out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dharma Transmitter Jiang arrived at the origin of the disturbance, looking at the void where there were no longer any traces, lost in thought. He looked around but found no clues, and couldn't help but frown slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After searching for a long time, finding nothing, the Dharma Transmitter Jiang was about to leave, when his eyes suddenly sharpened, and he looked back at the place where the world had fallen. The black energy, which Li Fan had thought he had completely collected, had actually reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon seeing this black energy, the Dharma Transmitter Jiang's expression dramatically changed. As if he had seen it before and was very familiar with it, the Dharma Transmitter Jiang did not hesitate. He opened his mouth wide and swallowed the black energy, and even the space within the range of the fall, in one gulp.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After consuming the black energy, the Dharma Transmitter Jiang's face visibly aged. Dark patterns surged from his body like a tide of ink, threatening to engulf him. Facing such a terrifying scene, the Dharma Transmitter Jiang's eyes remained incredibly calm. A ripple appeared from the center of his chest. The Dharma Transmitter Jiang's body, under the ripple, also began to tremble like the surface of a disturbed calm water.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In rhythmic vibrations, the Dharma Transmitter Jiang, along with the black energy and space he had swallowed, slowly faded. Finally, they disappeared. No more black energy emerged from that falling point, as if nothing had happened from the beginning...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan would never know that the "flies" he had perceived, the Myriad Immortals Alliance, had unknowingly solved a major problem for him. If the Dharma Transmitter had not timely cleared the black energy, it was possible that by the time Li Fan reacted, the black energy would have already silently encroached upon the Xuanhuang Realm. Li Fan's Dao Integration plan for this life might have been ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan was contemplating the reasons for the failure of his experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The world's ascension and the cultivator's ascension are fundamentally different."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not just reflected in the process, but also in the outcome."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"When cultivators return to normal from a 'high place,' they only feel slight discomfort at most. Unlike the world's fall, which is so tragic."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it's because the world absorbed a large amount of energy during the ascension process."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Recalling the scenes he saw in the minor world during its sublimation, Li Fan couldn't help but ponder inwardly. Having obtained the result of the experiment first, a new problem now lay before Li Fan. After pushing the Xuanhuang Realm to ascend, and before it could evolve into Heavenly Immortal Souls for Li Fan to devour, it was necessary to find a way to anchor the Super Xuanhuang Realm's altitude. Otherwise, Li Fan might shatter into pieces along with the Xuanhuang Realm and be forced to return in disgrace before he could achieve Dao Integration.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ascending upwards only stabilizes when a certain node is reached. This node should be the boundary between Immortals and mortals."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I wonder if my arrangements in this life are enough? If not, what method should I use to temporarily anchor the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The ascension of Xuanhuang to Immortality is indeed not easy. He originally thought that by following the plan step by step, he could achieve his goal. But after all, the difference between Immortals and mortals is like the difference between heaven and earth. As the plan slowly progressed, various problems emerged. Fortunately, Li Fan had enough capital to deal with them one by one, so he felt no anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While Li Fan was contemplating, the Xuanhuang Realm experienced a brief period of tranquility. Just like its original historical trajectory. But this rare tranquility was soon broken again. The reason was that someone had crossed the Horizon Distance Array and returned from the foot of the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensing the anomaly, Li Fan temporarily put away his thoughts. The returnee was Bai Hua. She looked somewhat battered. Her originally pure glazed body was now covered with scratches. Light and shadow flickered unstably, as if on the verge of extinguishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Master..." Seeing Li Fan appear before her, Bai Hua let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What happened? After I returned, I couldn't find traces of you all. The Remnant Realm Great Wall also fell into turmoil, and the accumulated residual True Immortal power poured down..." Li Fan asked with a solemn expression. While inquiring, he didn't forget to emit a strand of Origin Force essence to heal Bai Hua's injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The effect of Origin Force essence was immediate. Nourished by it, Bai Hua instantly regained her spirits. She first cupped her hands in thanks, and then said with some indignation: "That Yin Shangren, I don't know what madness he was suffering from. He rushed towards a certain point of the Remnant Realm Great Wall without regard for our dissuasion."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's one thing for him to not value his life, but shortly after, the anomaly erupted instantly. We were caught off guard and were affected by the residual True Immortal power, scattering us."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua suppressed her anger: "I was lucky. I happened to collide with the Remnant Realm Great Wall. Although I suffered some minor injuries, I ultimately saved my life."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist Qiao Gong, I'm afraid he wasn't as lucky." Bai Hua's expression turned grim. "I personally saw him drifting towards the high wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In my opinion, the danger is high..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Bai Hua's account, Li Fan fell into silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What about Xu Ke?" Li Fan asked again. Xu Ke had always had great luck, so he should have been able to escape danger.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The situation was too chaotic at the time, and I didn't see him. However, on my way back, I did see the communication mark he left behind."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-348" class="calibre1">Chapter 1331: Sunken Land of the Utmost Darkness</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The mark should have been left by Xu Ke recently. However, I searched the vicinity but couldn't find his trace. The residual True Immortal power became increasingly fierce, and I couldn't endure it any longer, so I had no choice but to return through the teleportation array," Bai Hua said, still somewhat shaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The principle of the Horizon Distance Array was actually different from ordinary teleportation arrays, but the effect was the same. Bai Hua habitually called it a teleportation array, and Li Fan did not correct her.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He began to follow the traces he had left on the few people earlier, sensing their current location and condition. Xu Ke and Qiao Gong were indeed still alive. However, Qiao Gong's situation was even better than Xu Ke's. Xu Ke's aura flickered erratically, clearly indicating that he was surviving with great difficulty in the aftermath of the True Immortal residual power. Meanwhile, Qiao Gong's situation was surprisingly stable, as if he was not affected by the turbulent Star Power at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Yin Shangren... The mark he left behind had completely disappeared. "As expected, there's something strange. Not to mention that with his current strength, he wouldn't be able to detect my methods. Even if he vaguely sensed it, based on my actions earlier, he should have treated it as my care and wouldn't have actively removed it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The border of the Star Sea, the Remnant Realm Great Wall, and the high wall were all unfamiliar territories to Li Fan. Letting these individuals with great luck who had survived the primordial calamity explore the way was Li Fan's original intention. This sudden outbreak of reverberating Star Power had merely accelerated the process.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan decided not to concern himself with them for the time being. He would ask them for details when they returned. He understood the temperaments of these people very well. Nothing major would happen. "Don't worry, they are all safe and have each had their own encounters."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Li Fan say this, Bai Hua's expression became somewhat subtle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Without paying attention to Bai Hua's thoughts, Li Fan handed over another ball of Origin Force essence: "Don't go to the teleportation array for now. Wait until the storm subsides." "However, with the True Immortal residual power blowing, the teleportation array needs maintenance periodically. Otherwise, once it's damaged, it will require another trip to re-establish it, adding many variables. This task will be entrusted to you."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Along with the Origin Force essence were various pieces of information related to maintaining the Horizon Distance Array. Bai Hua nodded in understanding and soon became engrossed in this profound formation knowledge. Although it only involved the basic unit structures of the great array and not its core parts, it still captivated Bai Hua.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After arranging for Bai Hua, Li Fan gazed into the Utmost Darkness Star Sea. "The impact of the reverberating Star Power will reach the vicinity of the Xuanhuang Realm in about half a month. Just like in his previous life, the entire world will be shaken violently."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It would be a pity to let this powerful force go to waste."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having witnessed the scene of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea from a higher dimensional perspective, and having personally seen a minor world ascend and then fall, shattering into pieces, Li Fan gained a new understanding of the residual True Immortal power accumulated and sealed by the Remnant Realm Great Wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The True Immortal power triggered by the 'Hunger' script attained by the True Immortal meditating in the Immortal Ruins, as it expanded outwards, encountered the obstruction of the high wall. Accumulating over time, it gathered beneath the high wall, forming a relative highland due to the accumulation of the True Immortal power's 'potential'."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Because it is merely a simple accumulation of power, it cannot maintain stability."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"On one hand, it will fall to lower places. On the other hand..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes, as if seeing the magnificent scene beneath the high wall again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Under normal circumstances, this True Immortal power should have slowly returned to the Utmost Darkness Star Sea. But for unknown reasons, the Remnant Realm Great Wall formed beneath the high wall, firmly blocking this True Immortal power."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Allowing it to form a peculiar stable state. Now, this stability has been broken."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The True Immortal power is pouring down, like a surging flood, slowly flowing into the low-lying Utmost Darkness Star Sea, raising the entire Star Sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A flash of enlightenment crossed Li Fan's mind. The rapid recovery of the Star Sea in his previous life might have been driven by this event.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What I need to do now is to find a way to intercept and temporarily store this flood."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"For future use when the Xuanhuang Realm ascends."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was undoubtedly a massive undertaking. To achieve perfection within the short span of half a month was impossible. Li Fan could only do his best.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The location of the Xuanhuang Realm was very special. Outside the Immortal Ruins. Because of the presence of the True Immortal meditating within the Immortal Ruins, from the perspective of the overall altitude distribution of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, the Xuanhuang Realm was undoubtedly near the highest peak. In fact, due to its proximity, it was already slightly situated at a higher ground. Like the surrounding slopes of a mountain rising from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, like an invisible barrier, the Xuanhuang Realm naturally faces less impact."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And what I need to do is to create a low-lying area and then guide the True Immortal power to accumulate there as much as possible."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded slightly. He had personally experienced the journey of ascension. To ascend and approach immortality, one only needed to continuously stimulate energy and elevate their own potential. But regarding how to create a low-lying area... Li Fan currently had no clues. However, when he overlooked the Utmost Darkness Sea from the high point of the Remnant Realm Great Wall and the main control core of the Utmost Darkness Sea, he had indeed seen lower-lying areas in the Star Sea compared to normal regions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's go and see first."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan acted decisively. He went to Ou Shangtian and generated some more True Immortal flesh and blood. Looking at Ou Shangtian, whose face was already as pale as thin gold, Li Fan frowned slightly. "It seems that finding True Immortal remains is imminent."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suppressed the thought for the time being. The Origin Force essence transformed into protective golden armor. The wooden sword phantom unsheathed, and in an instant, he had left the Xuanhuang Realm, speeding through the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While rapidly flying towards the target area in his memory, he also contemplated the changes in altitude. When the wooden sword left a certain area of the Star Sea, Li Fan seemed to sense something. He returned and stopped in the void, observing carefully. "Indeed, this is a natural low-lying area."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But if I hadn't seen the scene of high and low altitudes before and observed it from an elevated perspective, I might not have discovered its peculiarity."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It looks no different from other areas in the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan frowned. Rays of divine sense flew out, exploring various parts of the area separately. The result was the same as his perception. This low-lying area seemed to show no difference from normal regions due to its low potential.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Standing there for more than half a day, still making no progress. Li Fan suddenly realized something. He controlled his physical strength and spiritual power, flicked his finger, and shot out a sword qi. It was merely an imitation of a Nascent Soul stage cultivator's attack. The sword qi hissed as it flew past, tearing open a rift in the space. Although it vanished instantly and the rift quickly returned to its original state, Li Fan still saw it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"So that's how it is."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This low-lying area has become fragile."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly understood. It wasn't just the space itself. But all the conditions that maintained the existence of this space had significantly weakened compared to normal Star Sea regions. "The Xuanhuang Realm's cultivators in this region would be like True Immortals. They could destroy the world with a glance, and it would save a lot of effort."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan felt the fragility of this low-lying area. "Its potential, compared to the Xuanhuang Realm, is not much different. But in terms of concrete phenomena, it is so obvious!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan mused in silence. "If it were even lower, lower to the extreme, what would happen?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A question jumped out. Li Fan's thoughts drifted. However, this place was already the lowest point in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea. Li Fan's question currently had no ready answer for reference.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The date of the reverberating Star Power's impact was drawing closer, and Li Fan's thoughts returned to the present. "With my current understanding, I still cannot figure out the specific reasons for the formation of these low-lying areas."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But it doesn't prevent me from using them first."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When Li Fan was an official in Great Xuan, he had personally inspected and designed blueprints, carried out water conservancy projects, and benefited the region. To him now, the project of channeling True Immortal power towards the low-lying areas was essentially no different from water conservancy construction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This low-lying area is a natural reservoir."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What I need to do is to divert the True Immortal power here!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The first step is to prevent this low-lying area from absorbing the attracted True Immortal power, otherwise it will only lead to the rise and disappearance of the low-lying area..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Origin Force essence does not dissolve in True Immortal power, making it an excellent material."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A sharp glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes. Then, an endless stream of Origin Force essence, like a long cloth, erupted from him. Just a thin layer was used for isolation. Under Li Fan's manipulation, it quickly covered the entire low-lying area. Golden light dispersed, and the Origin Force essence dissipated into the darkness, seemingly no different from before. But Li Fan knew that compared to before, a qualitative change had occurred here.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Next, we need to expand the inlet of this low-lying area as much as possible."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At the same time, continuously strengthen the isolation layer at the bottom of the low-lying area."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Origin Force essence is running out, so I can only trouble the Ghost Tribe for now."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's divine sense moved, and the Ghost Tribe members raised in the Great Profound Minor World all sensed something. They all woke up from their slumber. Then they knelt and prayed piously, without eating or drinking. The Origin Force essence slowly became abundant again, while Li Fan, using the elevated perspective, looked down upon this area. The irregular boundary was not large in scope. If it were to truly encounter the True Immortal residual power, the amount that could be gathered might be extremely limited.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How to divert the flow?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After some thought, Li Fan had an idea. The wooden sword phantom flickered continuously. In the following days, Li Fan set up numerous Ascension Arrays in the vast Star Sea around the low-lying area.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the True Immortal flesh and blood was consumed too quickly, Li Fan had to return to the Xuanhuang Realm again. Ou Shangtian was already on the verge of death, and even the Kun Qian bone hand showed fine cracks. It seemed impossible to generate True Immortal flesh and blood in a short time. However, enough materials were finally gathered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The formations were arranged according to the plan. Li Fan felt the impending impact of the reverberating Star Power and waited silently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Currently, I have not found a way to anchor the state after ascension."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But a short-term burst can create peaks and change the direction of the True Immortal power. This is achievable."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to my precise calculations, the True Immortal power in this vast surrounding Star Sea will all be diverted here."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Buzz...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan expected, the reverberating Star Power, like a surging tide and a terrifying storm, arrived as scheduled. With resolute eyes, Li Fan activated the Ascension Arrays one after another. In the void not far from the Xuanhuang Realm in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, a miraculous scene appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Invisible to ordinary people. Only those who had ascended to a peak and looked down from above could glimpse it. Numerous low peaks suddenly rose, blocking the surging True Immortal power. Although these peaks quickly fell after rising, they truly collided with the surging True Immortal power. The low peaks rumbled and fell. The True Immortal power, after repeated collisions, changed its flow direction. All of it surged towards the low-lying area designated by Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It started as a gentle breeze. But as more and more True Immortal power was diverted, the roaring True Immortal power here became even stronger than the initial outbreak point beneath the high wall. Li Fan had to hide within the wooden sword phantom, relying on the profound meaning of [Transformation between True and False] to evade the influence of the True Immortal power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching the low-lying area gradually fill up, even with Li Fan's composure, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. "What True Immortals can do, I can also do now!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if it's a bit more troublesome, as long as I master the specific method, I can replicate it countless times in the future!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like being blocked by the Remnant Realm Great Wall beneath the high wall. Numerous amounts of True Immortal power piled up in the low-lying area. Due to the isolation of Origin Force essence and the inherent special nature of this place, it did not cause the "potential" of space itself to rise, but only continuously accumulated power. It was like another Immortal Ruins, slowly appearing before Li Fan's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The wooden sword phantom flickered, flickering on and off. The suction force grew stronger and stronger, as if truly facing a True Immortal in the Immortal Ruins. Li Fan frowned, controlling the phantom, and left the range of the low-lying area. Upon leaving the low-lying area, Li Fan immediately felt the massive suction force gathered within decrease significantly. It was as if they were no longer in the same world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The surge of True Immortal power continued. Finally, when the low-lying area was completely filled, the overflowing tide began to sweep towards other areas of the Star Sea. However, with such a large reservoir, the power of the storm had been significantly reduced. Especially since this reservoir was located in front of the Xuanhuang Realm, the beings in the Xuanhuang Realm hardly felt any of the resulting upheaval.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In this life, the Myriad Immortals Alliance members, who had also received the warning message from the Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate, looked at each other. "The tremor that the Heavenly Venerate mentioned shouldn't have arrived yet, right?" "It's definitely just the prelude; the main event is yet to come!"</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-349" class="calibre1">Chapter 1332: Again Poisoning Mo Ruibin</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, after waiting for a long time, the Dharma Transmitters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance never waited for greater turmoil in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Had the Heavenly Venerate misjudged? No matter how unbelievable it was, the Dharma Transmitters eventually had to accept this fact.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But out of reverence for the Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate, none of them dared to openly discuss it, let alone proactively inquire with the Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They could only attribute the reason to the Heavenly Venerate's deep concern for the common people of Xuanhuang, and even minor tremors were worth warning about, as a tremor had indeed occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unbeknownst to the beings of the Xuanhuang Realm, a vast amount of True Immortal power had quietly accumulated outside the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stood before the filled low-lying area, sensing the faint suction, and nodded with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This time's harvest was even greater than expected. The existence of the natural low-lying area served as a near-perfect container for the True Immortal power.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Coupled with the sealing formation Li Fan had set up at the edge of the area, the anomaly here could be perfectly concealed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was confident that even if the Dharma Transmitters meticulously investigated, they would not discover anything unusual here if they merely flew through.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"With the current accumulation, the plan for the Super Xuanhuang Realm has a greater chance of success."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The power triggered by the True Immortal meditating on the 'Hunger' script in the Immortal Ruins was naturally different from pure Immortal Spiritual Power and could not be directly absorbed by the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan could channel this vast power through the Ascension Array as a driving force for the Xuanhuang Realm's ascent, thereby greatly reducing the consumption of True Immortal flesh and blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise, with the output from Kun Qian's bone hand alone, even if Ou Shangtian was completely drained, it would be impossible to construct enough Ascension Arrays.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Like a lake suspended in the sky, like the ruins of the Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After gazing for a long time, Li Fan finally shifted his gaze away from the low-lying area.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He temporarily concealed the area with a formation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Next, we need to find a way to anchor the world's altitude."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Otherwise, we'll have to resort to risky measures and force out the Heavenly Immortal Souls before the Xuanhuang Realm's Immortal Fall. The situation will change instantly, and anything could happen. We might fail at the last moment..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The output of True Immortal flesh and blood and Origin Force essence must also be increased simultaneously."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To act like a True Immortal in a mortal body naturally comes with many constraints.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Li Fan, with his accumulations from multiple reincarnations, could find various peculiar substitute powers, they were not Immortal Spiritual Power itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he got closer to his goal, everything became increasingly troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan currently had no clue on how to temporarily anchor the world at a high altitude.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Setting aside the meditating True Immortal in the Immortal Ruins, from the elevated perspective, apart from the Remnant Realm Great Wall at the foot of the high wall, the peaks in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea were mostly gathered in the depths of the Xuanhuang Realm's Utmost Darkness Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, there were also naturally formed peaks in the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the low-lying area here, they were not something Li Fan could currently research and comprehend.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Next, we'll proceed with two strategies simultaneously."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At the foot of the high wall, and in the Utmost Darkness Sea... both need to be analyzed concurrently."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for the high wall, perhaps we can leave it to the Profound Immortal Boat. Their ability to research and utilize True Immortal scripts means those Immortal Boat elders are definitely capable. As for the Utmost Darkness Sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The image of Mo Rubin, the Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect, immediately appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Coincidentally, through the exchange with the Immortal Boat, I have already mastered the [Reveal] script. Perhaps it's time to awaken Mo Rubin."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the functions of the [Reveal] script is to reveal the connections between all things.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin's cultivation techniques were all inherited from the Azure Nether Pearl.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, perhaps by relying on the [Reveal] script, he could follow the clues and find the Azure Nether Pearl or even traces of King Xuan Tian.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This person, Mo Rubin, cultivates the [Myriad Tribulations Undying Demonic Heart Immortal Art]. Multiple personalities can be switched almost at will. Furthermore, he is meticulous and cunning."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But King Xuan Tian is his fatal weakness..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's figure flickered, and in an instant, he returned to Xuanhuang and arrived beneath the Dao Platform.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The giant net woven by Origin Force essence was sealing the sleeping Mo Rubin and Ji Yuzhen's primordial souls.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not awaken Ji Yuzhen, the female Dharma King.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although he had already absorbed most of her memories and understood her better, this female Dharma King felt more dangerous to Li Fan than Mo Rubin.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Relatively speaking, Mo Rubin, with whom he had interacted for several lifetimes, was easier to handle.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Flicking his finger, the wooden sword phantom unsheathed, and Li Fan took Mo Rubin to the void outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he slowly withdrew the sealing golden net.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Exposed to the cold and silent Utmost Darkness Star Sea, Mo Rubin instinctively sensed danger and slowly woke up.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Almost the moment he regained consciousness, Mo Rubin noticed Li Fan standing not far away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm? I remember before I fell asleep, I was..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin was initially confused, then he pondered for a moment and roughly guessed the culprit behind all this.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What does Daoist friend intend to do?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin sized up Li Fan, his words full of vigilance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A mirror-like boundary, hidden in the darkness, silently materialized and locked onto Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was a divine ability from the Myriad Tribulations Undying Demonic Heart Immortal Art, which could replace the figure reflected on the other side of the mirror, turning it into a new demonic heart added to oneself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As long as they were enveloped by it, regardless of their cultivation level, they would be unable to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This was Mo Rubin's confidence, inherited from the Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Mo Rubin soon sensed something was wrong, and his expression changed slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The mirror had indeed enveloped Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But there was no trace of Li Fan on the other side of the mirror!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if the person before him was merely an illusion that did not exist in the real world!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Contradictorily, the unrestrained life force emanating from Li Fan clearly indicated his reality!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The [Transformation between True and False] was even above the [Creation] True Immortal script, naturally beyond Mo Rubin's comprehension.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, this Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect only knew that he had encountered a very troublesome enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After trying several more times and still being unable to lock onto Li Fan, he decisively gave up.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Silently, he retracted the mirror boundary divine ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist Mo need not be nervous. If I truly intended to harm you, why would I have awakened you intentionally?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Myriad Tribulations Undying Demonic Heart Immortal Art is not truly indestructible. I have at least three or four methods to break it," Li Fan said with a slight smile and a soft voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These words were like thunder to Mo Rubin.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Myriad Tribulations Undying Demonic Heart Immortal Art was a cultivation technique personally taught to him by King Xuan Tian, and few people knew about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet Li Fan had revealed the heavenly secret in one sentence... wωω ●●￠ ○</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Who exactly is Daoist friend?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin asked with a solemn expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not answer directly but instead asked: "Does Daoist friend know how long you have been asleep?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His attention had been fully drawn to Li Fan before.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, reminded by Li Fan, Mo Rubin counted on his fingers and his body trembled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ten thousand years have passed, and everything has changed. If Daoist friend is interested, why not listen to me tell you the story of these years?" Li Fan said sincerely.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin pondered, then nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, Li Fan began to narrate the story of the destruction of the Tian Xuan Sect, the rise of the Ten Great Sects, the subsequent calamities, the near-destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm, the sudden emergence of the Dharma Transmitter Heavenly Venerate, and the division of power between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders' Council.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin's expression constantly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"These insects of the Ten Great Sects deserve to die!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">From beginning to end, Mo Rubin could only utter this single sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">During other times, he listened attentively.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With his demonic heart immortal art's keen perception of the emotions of those around him, Mo Rubin was eighty percent sure that the other party was not lying.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The members of the Ten Great Sects inherited the legacy of the Xuan Tian Sect and also had the true teachings of the Great Master, so they would not be easily destroyed. Some of them had already left the realm before the calamity fully erupted."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Left?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"They didn't leave the Xuanhuang Realm, but crossed the high wall to go beyond it!" Li Fan said with certainty.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin's reaction was unprecedentedly intense: "Beyond the high wall? Impossible!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had long anticipated Mo Rubin's response: "Daoist friend, please watch!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a gentle wave of his hand, an image of a sky-piercing sword erupting with boundless light, tearing through heaven and earth, and soaring away appeared before Mo Rubin's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This was the scene when the Heavenly Sword Sect forged the Realm-Breaking Divine Sword and left the realm. Although I'm not sure if they succeeded, such might should indicate more than just escaping the Xuanhuang Realm, right?" Li Fan asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin stared intently at the endlessly repeating image.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Realm-Breaking Divine Weapon is merely a mortal artifact. How could it cross the high wall? It's simply laughable!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin refused to change his stance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The divine weapon was forged by refining [Primordial Essence Gold] with countless sword intent Dao embryos, supplemented by countless heavenly materials and earthly treasures..." Li Fan said unhurriedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin interrupted Li Fan: "Just these? No matter what heavenly materials and earthly treasures, as long as they are products of the Xuanhuang Realm, they cannot have this effect."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What if... a strand of pure Immortal Spiritual Power were added?" Li Fan asked again in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"!!!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin's head shot up, staring at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal Spiritual Power?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His expression and tone were completely different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long silence, Mo Rubin said faintly: "If the core of this Realm-Breaking Divine Weapon truly contained Immortal Spiritual Power, then it's indeed possible to cross the high wall with this..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's it." Li Fan said inexplicably.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Did the Realm-Breaking Divine Weapon forged by the Heavenly Sword Sect back then truly contain Immortal Spiritual Power? Li Fan didn't know.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the forging of the divine weapon by the Heavenly Sword Sect was instructed by Mr. Bai.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Bai inherited the legacy of the Great Heavenly Venerate and had even returned from the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">How could he not know that ordinary mortal materials could not cross the high wall? If they failed, they would collide with the high wall and undoubtedly perish.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Given Mr. Bai's character, how could he do something that would lead to a futile sacrifice?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, in his previous life, after learning the weight of the Great Heavenly Venerate's legacy from Sun Tianci, Li Fan developed this conjecture: Mr. Bai had once divided a portion of the Immortal Spiritual Power obtained from detonating the Immortal Artifacts and gave it to the Heavenly Sword Sect, successfully helping them complete the plan to escape through the realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because compared to the remaining four Immortal Artifacts such as the Great Sun Golden Bell, the amount of Immortal Spiritual Power obtained from detonating the other nine Immortal Artifacts was indeed too little.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was less like being consumed and more like being divided.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was even uncertain whether other sect members, besides the Heavenly Sword Sect, were on that Realm-Breaking Divine Weapon back then.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Faced with Li Fan's explanation, Mo Rubin was silent for a long time, and then couldn't help but curse: "Damn it, he only cared about his own escape and ignored the common people of Xuanhuang!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin had the confidence to curse like this.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Back then, King Xuan Tian, who was already a half-immortal, could absolutely escape alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was precisely for the sake of taking his homeland, the Xuanhuang Realm, with him that the long Star Crossing plan and subsequent twists and turns occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Mo Rubin say this, Li Fan also went with the flow and shifted the topic to King Xuan Tian.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"King Xuan Tian's character was noble, like the sun shining through the ages, peerless in the world. Not to mention these rats of the Ten Great Sects, even after ten thousand years, no one has appeared to inherit his aspirations. The Xuanhuang Realm has persisted until now only because its inhabitants sought self-salvation." Li Fan couldn't help but sigh, lamenting.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Li Fan praising King Xuan Tian so much, Mo Rubin's perception of him gradually changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he did not immediately let down his guard.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To be honest, I wish to follow King Xuan Tian's ambition, save the Xuanhuang Realm from dire straits, and help it cross the high wall to escape this Utmost Darkness Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"For this, I have poured all my effort and wisdom for half my life. When my lifespan is nearing its end, looking back, I find that in the vast Xuanhuang Realm, there is not a single person worthy of trust or companionship." Li Fan's tone conveyed a hint of desolation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin, after careful observation, also discovered the fact that Li Fan's lifespan was nearing its end.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His pupils contracted sharply.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan continued: "By chance, I discovered the deeds of the heroes of the ancient Xuan Tian Sect, and my heart was greatly moved, considering them as confidants."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I even searched for traces of any possible survivors and finally found you, Fellow Daoist, who was in slumber..." Li Fan looked at Mo Rubin, revealing a look of contentment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin felt a complex mix of emotions surge within him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, being cautious by nature, he suppressed these emotions and began to ponder the credibility of what the other party had said.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The matters of the Xuan Tian Sect happened over ten thousand years ago. How do you know about them?" Mo Rubin asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In a circular mountain, amidst blooming flowers, I discovered the fragmented soul of Ji Yuzhen." Li Fan replied truthfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although it's just a hodgepodge of countless memory fragments, I can still glimpse the past events of the Xuan Tian Sect."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin's expression trembled: "Ji Yuzhen? Is she still alive?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head slightly: "Only a remnant soul remains."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin was about to say something more, but suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of silence, he looked directly at Li Fan and said, "Back then, the Xuan Tian Sect suffered a great upheaval. Brothers died or were injured, and contact was lost. There might even have been traitors among us..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Honestly, besides King Xuan Tian, I trust no one."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded, expressing understanding: "In fact, I awakened you also because I wanted to find King Xuan Tian."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-350" class="calibre1">Chapter 1333: The Heavenly King's Mysterious Disappearance</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"These past few years, in pursuit of the heroes of the former Xuan Tian Sect, I've scoured the ends of the earth, leaving almost no corner of the Xuanhuang Realm unsearched. While I've been fortunate enough to find some traces of the Dharma Kings, I've yet to discover any clues relating to King Xuan Tian himself. Yet, I can hardly believe that with King Xuan Tian's peerless cultivation back then, he has truly perished..." Li Fan said with utmost sincerity, his face etched with earnestness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin listened quietly, his expression unreadable.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Tens of thousands of years have passed, and the situation in the Xuanhuang Realm grows increasingly perilous, teetering on the brink of falling into the Immortal Ruins. If not for the numerous arrangements King Xuan Tian left behind back then, it likely wouldn't have held on until now!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The arrangements from back then?" Mo Rubin narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Precisely, the Star Crossing Great Array!" Li Fan exclaimed with deep emotion. "Built upon the foundation of an ancient immortal array, it manifested near-immortal power through mortal means! It's a shame the array is already incomplete..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stated gravely, "Reactivating the Star Crossing Great Array might be the only means of saving the world. This array is profoundly mysterious; even after ten thousand years since its construction, I cannot fully comprehend it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin snorted, "That's only natural. Immortal Realm inheritances, how could mortal cultivators possibly fathom them!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan agreed, nodding in concurrence, "First, the Ten Great Immortal Sects collectively fled, followed by ten millennia of strife and calamity, leading to the extinction of countless legacies. Now, the standards of arrays, artifacts, elixirs, and talismans in the Xuanhuang Realm, compared to ten thousand years ago, have not only failed to progress but have also declined significantly!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"To reconstruct and restore the Star Crossing Great Array, finding King Xuan Tian is our only hope! But as I mentioned before, there isn't even the slightest shred of a clue! My lifespan is nearing its end, and I simply cannot wait any longer. In my utmost desperation, I had no choice but to awaken you, fellow Daoist."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan observed Mo Rubin's pensive expression and continued with a heavy tone, "From the residual memories of Ji Yuzhen's soul, I also learned of the existence of traitors within the Xuan Tian Sect back then. Therefore, making this decision was an act of great courage on my part. I feared entrusting this to the wrong person, which could lead to unforeseen consequences for King Xuan Tian. Hence, I chose to awaken you in the void outside the Xuanhuang Realm, far from its borders..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the Ten Sects attacked the Xuan Tian Sect back then, where were you, Daoist friend? In Dharma King Ji's memories, you were always by King Xuan Tian's side!" Li Fan's tone gradually turned solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing that the cultivator from this later generation was actually interrogating him, Mo Rubin did not get angry. Frowning slightly, he recalled the events of that year, as if transported back to the day that changed the fate of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, I was guiding the core cultivators of the Ten Sects into the depths of the sect." Mo Rubin's words were astonishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyebrows twitched, but instead of becoming agitated, he quietly awaited further explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin seemed slightly surprised by Li Fan's composure. He nodded slightly and continued, "At that moment, Brother Xuanyuan had already detected those within the sect with impure intentions, who were colluding with the Ten Sects and plotting against us."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, Brother Xuanyuan was undergoing a breakthrough and decided to play along, luring the snakes out of their holes..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin paused, taking a deep breath. "The plan was proceeding smoothly; I had successfully gained the trust of the Ten Sects. And I led them to quietly break through the protective barriers of the Xuan Tian Sect's headquarters..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A hint of regret flickered in Mo Rubin's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, those barriers could only serve to delay them. The true killing blow was Brother Xuanyuan's strength after his breakthrough, and the killing array he personally set up. Actively dismantling and dispersing them actually lessened their vigilance. It was just that we didn't anticipate..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Flee quickly!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if King Xuan Tian's final transmission from back then echoed in his ears. Mo Rubin instinctively clenched his fist.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I heard Brother Xuanyuan's message telling me to flee quickly, and I knew something must have gone wrong. So I accelerated towards the direction where Brother's aura had vanished..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"That was not the agreed-upon ambush location, nor was it Brother Xuanyuan's usual cultivation retreat. It was merely the hall where the Faceless Immortal statue was displayed. Brother Xuanyuan had ordered it sealed earlier. For some reason, Brother reappeared there."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the time I was the first to arrive, Brother had completely vanished. And that statue..." Mo Rubin suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Mo Rubin's account, Li Fan's heart was profoundly shaken. However, he feigned ignorance, "The Faceless Immortal statue, what is that? And why was it sealed by the Xuan Tian Sect? After the Ten Immortal Sects unified the Xuanhuang Realm, they erased everything related to the former Xuan Tian Sect. Dharma King Ji's residual memories also seem to lack any mention of this Faceless Immortal statue."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin looked up, observing Li Fan, and after some thought, finally explained, "The Faceless Immortal is a True Immortal who saved Brother Xuanyuan's life. When Brother Xuanyuan first arrived in the Immortal Realm, before he could condense his True Immortal body, a calamity descended. If not for the casual rescue by this Faceless True Immortal, he might have perished in the Immortal Realm back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan slowly nodded. Then, he couldn't help but ask with complete bewilderment, "It seems this Faceless True Immortal was a good person. Why did the Xuan Tian Sect later order the sealing of his statue, appearing to be full of wariness towards him?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin let out a cold snort, "A good person... He was no ordinary person, but a complete True Immortal. The same matter, from the perspective of a mortal cultivator and a True Immortal, would elicit entirely different attitudes! Initially, Brother Xuanyuan erected the Faceless Immortal statue, firstly to express his gratitude for the life-saving kindness. And secondly, to attempt to establish contact with this True Immortal whom he met only fleetingly."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If we could obtain the help of this senior True Immortal, saving the Xuanhuang Realm would undoubtedly be much easier..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin's expression grew progressively grim as he spoke, "However, Brother Xuanyuan soon realized he was mistaken. The attitude of True Immortals towards mortal beings can only be described as indifferent!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Faceless Immortal could casually save Brother Xuanyuan because Brother Xuanyuan had already ascended the immortal path; even if he hadn't condensed his True Immortal body yet, he was a true 'Half-Immortal.' He was of the same kind. But for mortal beings... even for the inhabitants of an entire world, even if it were just a gesture, the Faceless Immortal was utterly unwilling and disdainful to act!" Mo Rubin spoke with cold hatred.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"He even went so far as to persuade and warn Brother Xuanyuan..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin was filled with indignation. Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes and quicken his breathing, feigning righteous indignation.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The distinction between Immortals and mortals is like the chasm between heaven and earth. But no matter what, aren't Immortals also ascended mortals? To stand by and watch while they perish, with such indifference!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin continued, "As the saying goes, those with different paths cannot plan together. After their opinions diverged, Brother Xuanyuan no longer contacted this True Immortal and sealed the statue. He even planned to recast the Xuan Tian statues in various locations."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, before he could act, the drastic change had already occurred."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to what you're saying, Daoist, it's highly likely that King Xuan Tian met his unfortunate end at the hands of the Faceless Immortal?" Li Fan asked with feigned shock.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A True Immortal personally intervening, even with King Xuan Tian's peerless demeanor, it would be difficult to survive, right? No wonder I haven't found any trace of him for so many years..." Li Fan pretended to suddenly understand, then adopted a crestfallen demeanor.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin frowned, interrupting Li Fan's self-muttering, "Although the Faceless Immortal had some differences in ideology with Brother Xuanyuan, there was no reason for him to resort to killing."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, True Immortals, though powerful, could not possibly kill Brother Xuanyuan in an instant," Mo Rubin stated with certainty.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Xuanyuan was already a Half-Immortal upon reaching the Immortal Realm. Before executing the 'luring the snakes out of their holes' plan, he told us that after battling with the Great Dharma Master, he achieved another breakthrough. Even if he wasn't a true Immortal in the ancient sense, he possessed enough strength to traverse the high wall himself."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's heart trembled once more, "Then what exactly was it that caused the ever-advancing King Xuan Tian to disappear inexplicably?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even as he spoke those words, Li Fan's mind couldn't help but recall the scene from his previous life: the Cat Demon unexpectedly appearing at the end, devouring the True Immortal phantoms in one gulp, and then whisking away the True Immortal from the Immortal Ruins in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two situations were remarkably similar!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could there be some connection between them?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But the incident in Xuan Tian happened more than ten thousand years ago. Furthermore, based on my previous speculation that the time flow outside the high wall might be inconsistent, if it were indeed someone from beyond the high wall who acted, it would have been tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of years ago for them..." Li Fan found this line of reasoning somewhat flawed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, looking at it this way, the methods of the powers beyond the wall for hunting True Immortals have indeed improved significantly. King Xuan Tian, not being a True Immortal, managed to send a warning message when facing misfortune. But that True Immortal from the Immortal Ruins, who was a True Immortal of the Immortal Realm, and had cultivated in the Immortal Ruins for ten thousand years, perhaps reaching the realm of the Nameless True Immortal, yet his fate was even more dire." A sense of dread surged within Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Faced with Li Fan's inquiry, Mo Rubin could only remain silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">If he knew the answer, he wouldn't have been filled with such trepidation, as if he had lost his backbone, when being chased by the Ten Immortal Sects.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although I'm not sure what terrifying existence caused King Xuan Tian's disappearance, I am certain that Brother Xuanyuan is still alive in this world." Mo Rubin stated with firm conviction after a long silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Oh?" Li Fan raised his eyebrows, finding Mo Rubin's confidence difficult to comprehend.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After carefully choosing his words, Mo Rubin continued, "Back then, when I rushed to the scene after Brother Xuanyuan disappeared, the hall displaying the Faceless Immortal statue had already been damaged."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And that Faceless Immortal statue..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Had startlingly grown a face!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The statue had fallen to the ground, its head severed mid-air, rolling to the side. But the face of the lone, fallen statue head was exactly like Brother Xuanyuan's!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin uttered words that left Li Fan utterly astonished.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene from that year flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What happened again?" Li Fan asked, full of bewildered confusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin said grimly, "Initially, we all believed the Faceless Immortal had harmed King Xuan Tian. But later, during our escape, I felt a growing sense of unease. The reason is precisely as I've said before."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Later, I ventured back and found a surviving Xuan Tian statue. I attempted to use the method Brother Xuanyuan taught us to re-establish contact with this Faceless Immortal..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gasped, "Daoist friend, your actions truly treated your life as nothing!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ignoring Li Fan's praise, Mo Rubin continued, "True Immortals generally pay no heed to us mortal ants. As expected, my first attempt at communication yielded no response."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, I didn't give up. I persisted continuously, for a full three years, initiating communication every moment!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately understood Mo Rubin's implication.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if they disdain to acknowledge ants, if ants persistently pester them, True Immortals will surely be enraged and descend punishment. Based on my understanding of the Faceless Immortal, He indeed possessed the ability to do so."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But strangely, He did not. It was as if it were merely an ordinary stone statue, with no response for three whole years."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thus, I deduced that after that day, not only King Xuan Tian, but even that Faceless Immortal, was severely wounded!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The reason the Faceless Immortal statue bizarrely manifested Brother Xuanyuan's face, and even had its head severed..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan interjected with disbelief, "Could it be that the Faceless Immortal intervened and helped King Xuan Tian escape a calamity?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin nodded, "This is also why I firmly believe Brother Xuanyuan is still alive. Although our paths differ, based on what Brother Xuanyuan had hinted at in the past, his relationship with this Faceless Immortal was actually quite good."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, they are, after all, of the same kind. With a precedent of mutual assistance, saving him again is not impossible."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan remained silent for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a prolonged pause, he shook his head and denied, "This is merely your speculation, Daoist friend."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I originally thought that the opponent King Xuan Tian encountered back then, at most, would be another Half-Immortal. If a True Immortal, or even a stronger existence, intervened, the possibility of King Xuan Tian surviving would be exceedingly slim!" Li Fan said with a hint of dejection.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Based solely on your guesswork, it is difficult to convince others."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin hesitated for a long time, then finally said in a deep voice, "It's not just baseless speculation. There's a subtle connection with Brother Xuanyuan that informs me, telling me Big Brother is still alive in this world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin's words were vague and ambiguous. Li Fan wanted to press for more details, but Mo Rubin refused to elaborate.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Azure Nether Pearl?" Li Fan couldn't help but guess in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Alright, since you are so certain, I will trust you this once!" Seeing that he could not elicit more information, Li Fan pretended to ponder for a long time before finally relenting.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Anyway, I don't have much time left to live; this is just a last gamble."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Observing your words and actions, Daoist, you are certainly not one of the traitors from the former Xuan Tian Sect. Perhaps we can cooperate to find the whereabouts of King Xuan Tian." Li Fan stared intently at Mo Rubin.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You know a great deal about King Xuan Tian, but you are unfamiliar with the current Xuanhuang Realm. Ten thousand years have passed, and landscapes have drastically changed. The arrangements left behind by the Xuan Tian Sect might have also disappeared with the upheaval of mountains and rivers. I have already scoured the entire Xuanhuang Realm these years and can directly lead you to the areas worth investigating, greatly increasing the efficiency of our search."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Furthermore, the remnants of the Ten Immortal Sects have now formed the Five Elders' Council, controlling half of the Xuanhuang Realm. Without my cooperation, even if you possess considerable strength, Daoist, you will inevitably encounter many troubles."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-351" class="calibre1">Chapter 1334: True Immortal You Resuscitates</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing Li Fan's suggestion, Mo Rubin did not immediately respond. He remained silent, deep in thought for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Gazing at Li Fan, his eyes fell upon his long, streaked-with-white hair. Perhaps it was due to Li Fan's sincere words and his genuinely approaching end of lifespan, that Mo Rubin finally nodded in agreement: "There is no reason why not."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded joyfully, "Excellent! With your assistance, Daoist brother, we will surely achieve twice the results with half the effort!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If that's the case, let us return to the Xuanhuang Realm first!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The phantom of the wooden sword was unsheathed, and Li Fan extended his hand, inviting Mo Rubin to enter.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Initially, Mo Rubin paid it no mind, but after personally entering the phantom's range and experiencing its incredible speed, his expression finally shifted slightly. His gaze towards Li Fan changed once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, witnessing with his own eyes how the phantom's protection allowed them to ignore the suction of the Immortal Ruins and smoothly descend into the Xuanhuang Realm, Mo Rubin could no longer contain himself and said, "It seems, Daoist friend, you are truly one of the most remarkable individuals of this era."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gave a wry smile and shook his head, "While I can be unrivaled in one era, I cannot suppress all eras. Moreover, even with all sorts of divine abilities, lifespan will eventually reach its limit, won't it? This divine ability is simply beyond the decree of heaven."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin opened his mouth, but said nothing more.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, they had descended into the Xuanhuang Realm. Mo Rubin's divine sense swept across the world silently. Upon seeing the vast regions, expanded countless times, and the towering white mist barrier between heaven and earth, even this well-traveled Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect couldn't help but show a flicker of astonishment in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, he sighed with emotion, "If I hadn't truly sensed the residual traces of the Star Crossing Great Array, I would never have been able to connect this magnificent world before me with the Xuanhuang Realm of ancient times."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After ten thousand years, the changes in the world have reached this point!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded, "When the world is on the verge of destruction, the changes in all things occur hundreds or thousands of times faster than usual. Observing these changes, their speed is like lightning, their swiftness like light. This is the Dao of Heaven saving itself..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan spoke, he casually conjured an illusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the ball of light, the Xuanhuang Realm was plunged into chaos, yin and yang disordered; stars dimmed, mountains and rivers trembled; plants withered, birds and beasts fled. It was a scene of imminent apocalypse.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the critical juncture of life and death, the Xuanhuang Realm indeed gave rise to various reactive changes. Ice freezing and heat dissipating, time flowing and ebbing, heavenly punishment and earthly destruction...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin was momentarily mesmerized.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At a crucial moment, Li Fan let out a light cough and retracted the illusionary ball of light.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin felt a sense of wistful loss surge within him. He faintly sensed that the scene within the ball of light seemed to genuinely contain the principles of the evolution of heaven and earth. For any cultivator, it was an unimaginable treasure. However, Li Fan had only displayed it for too short a time, and Mo Rubin couldn't comprehend much. Moreover, as a Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect and a revered elder awakened from ancient times in the Xuanhuang Realm, Mo Rubin did not shamelessly ask Li Fan to display it again.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps after we successfully find Brother Xuanyuan and become more familiar, then..." Mo Rubin couldn't help but think.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Of course, the reason the Xuanhuang Realm has become what it is today, besides the natural changes of the Dao of Heaven, is also due to the clandestine actions of the Transmitting Dharma Heavenly Venerate," Li Fan continued to speak truthfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Transmitting Dharma is likely a Venerate from the former Heavenly Law Realm. When the Heavenly Law Realm was destroyed, Transmitting Dharma sought to use the only surviving Xuanhuang Realm in the Star Sea for reincarnation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Transmitting Dharma has cultivated in the Star Sea for thousands of years, their strength unfathomable, perhaps having reached the limits of mortality. I cannot defeat him!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"We must act cautiously and guard against this person. Transmitting Dharma will not let go of any existence that threatens his revival of the Heavenly Law Realm," Li Fan sighed, offering a kind suggestion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Transmitting Dharma is actually quite decent. It's just a pity that he is destined to be on the opposite side of the Xuanhuang Realm." Mo Rubin observed the incongruous remnants of other worlds within the Xuanhuang Realm, deep within the world, and his belief in Li Fan's words grew stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"What a pity..." In truth, Mo Rubin held a certain degree of goodwill towards this powerful figure who, in name, had overthrown the Ten Immortal Sects. However, upon seeing the scene of the Xuanhuang Realm being dismembered and reshaped, and hearing Li Fan's hushed narration, that already faint goodwill vanished instantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Rest assured, we will act discreetly. Until we find Brother Xuanyuan, we will not confront this Transmitting Dharma Heavenly Venerate." Mo Rubin's gaze constantly swept across the heavens and earth, as if sensing for some trace.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, he frowned, "It seems the Star Crossing Great Array is indeed severely damaged. We can only sense faint residual aura, and cannot manipulate it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Partly due to the passage of time, and partly because during the ten thousand years ago when the Ten Immortal Sects manipulated the Star Crossing Great Array to capture other cultivation worlds, continuous battles ensued. The array was increasingly damaged, yet the cultivators of the Ten Sects were incapable of repairing it, which ultimately led to the array's complete destruction..." Li Fan said slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At the very least, according to my investigation, that's how it happened." Seeing the sharp glint flash in Mo Rubin's eyes, Li Fan shrugged, speaking with complete honesty.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"How could those useless beings from the Ten Sects possibly manipulate the Star Crossing Great Array?! Unless..." A dangerous aura suddenly emanated from Mo Rubin.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan subtly shifted his position, agreeing, "It must have been a Dharma King who betrayed the sect and revealed the manipulation method to the Ten Sects."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin's brow furrowed deeply, but he did not respond. After a long silence, he shook his head and said, "Not necessarily. Perhaps they were interrogated after being captured by the Ten Immortal Sects."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was somewhat surprised by Mo Rubin's attitude upon hearing this. Because he knew that King Xuan Tian had entrusted the manipulation methods of various sub-arrays of the Star Crossing Great Array to different Dharma Kings separately, to prevent unforeseen accidents. Mo Rubin was responsible for the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array, the Sea of Darkness. As for Ji Yuzhen, she was responsible for the Horizontal Golden Chain. Perhaps sensing Li Fan's emotions, Mo Rubin began to explain his reasons for actively defending them: "Back then, Brother Xuanyuan revealed to me that Ji Yuzhen and Luo Yichen were in charge of the Star Locking Golden Chain..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Among the twelve of us, anyone could have betrayed us, except for those two. They would not." Mo Rubin stated with conviction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pondered, "In Dharma King Ji's memories, she deeply adored King Xuan Tian. As for Luo Yichen..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin nodded, "Indeed, it was only after her heart was set on Brother Xuanyuan that Luo killed all her myriad consorts. From then on, she devoted herself solely to one person."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan shook his head even more vigorously, "King Xuan Tian entrusted the same task to these two women. This was a foolish decision!"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend thinks too much. The two of them have a very good relationship with each other." Mo Rubin chuckled dismissively.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not elaborate further. While chatting casually, they decided on the first location to search for King Xuan Tian's whereabouts. It was within the Sea of Darkness. Their exploration followed a similar path to Li Fan's in his previous life. After some difficulty, and with Li Fan feigning extreme surprise, they finally reached the central core of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array. First, they were horrified by the True Immortal corpse in the depths of the Sea of Darkness and the faintly stirrings of the True Immortal's will to survive. Regaining his senses, Mo Rubin paused slightly, "Hmm? It seems someone has been here not long ago!" Li Fan's heart was startled. He hadn't expected that Mo Rubin, despite Li Fan's efforts to conceal his tracks during his previous visit, could still detect it. However, he remained calm, his face showing a hint of pleasant surprise, and quickly asked, "Is it King Xuan Tian?" Mo Rubin did not doubt the person beside him. After all, this array seal was the formidable Immortal Array 'Spirit Gathering Ascension,' and it was not easy for ordinary individuals to break through and enter. "However, there are indeed traces of predecessors who entered this place before. Although they couldn't reach the True Immortal corpse at the very core..." "The people of the Ten Immortal Sects died here. They were likely lured by someone and then killed by the True Immortal's will to survive." "Could it be Elder Cui?" Cui Zhiyuan was another Dharma King who jointly managed the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array with him. While thinking this, Mo Rubin re-examined the traces of this array's activation and still felt something was amiss. "It doesn't seem like the restrictions were directly activated, but rather a forceful breakthrough without damaging the immortal array. Using brute force to overcome ingenuity..." "Furthermore, after the fact, the array was improved to seal the True Immortal's will and prevent intrusion." Mo Rubin pondered for a long time, ultimately finding the identity of this intruder unfathomable. Li Fan, of course, saw his confusion but did not kindly reveal the events involving the Transmitting Dharma Heavenly Venerate in his previous life. Mo Rubin agonized for a while longer before finally deciding to set this matter aside for now. He began to search for King Xuan Tian's trace within the Sea of Darkness. The Spirit Gathering Ascension Array, like a circular observation deck, suddenly illuminated within the Sea of Darkness. Faint fluctuations emanated from it, spreading rapidly through the Sea of Darkness. After a full half-incense stick of time, Li Fan finally sensed these fluctuations returning. Mo Rubin's expression was impassive as he awaited the results of the complete search. It was evident that King Xuan Tian was not present in this Sea of Darkness. Li Fan saw Mo Rubin's brow furrowed deeply again and couldn't help but comfort him, "We'll head to the next location then." Mo Rubin shook his head, "I never expected to find Brother Xuanyuan so easily." "I just feel that this Sea of Darkness is somewhat... off." Li Fan's heart stirred, "What do you mean?" "The Sea of Darkness was established upon the remains of a True Immortal. Although the True Immortal has completely perished, they were, after all, True Immortals. Their methods are far beyond the imagination of us mortal cultivators." "For instance, the 'will to survive' that naturally arises upon sensing a living being's intrusion. The Dark energy accumulated here, compared to back then, seems to have undergone subtle changes," Mo Rubin's expression was rather solemn. Li Fan followed Mo Rubin's gaze and looked into the boundless darkness. Mo Rubin continued speaking in a deep voice, "When a True Immortal perishes, the Dark energy is masterless. But this power was generated utilizing the True Immortal's remains. While everything was dormant, it was fine. But precisely because a sliver of the True Immortal's will to survive was agitated..." "Perhaps under the influence of this will to survive, the Dark energy has become different." Li Fan feigned extreme shock, "The abilities of a True Immortal are so terrifying? What specific changes are you referring to regarding this Dark energy?" Mo Rubin: "It's not clear yet. But one thing is certain: it is evolving in a direction that favors the True Immortal's revival. Even if complete resurrection is impossible, the trend will surely exist." "Perhaps when this Dark energy in the Sea of Darkness encounters life forms useful for the True Immortal's revival, it will launch a similar attack, just like the corpses you saw on the way. Their life essence was completely drained, becoming nourishment for the True Immortal's revival..." "Fortunately, after the transformation by the Spirit Gathering Ascension Array, the Dark energy is far less influenced by the True Immortal's remains than the True Immortal's will. Things are not as bad as I imagined." Li Fan deeply agreed, "The energy accumulated in this Sea of Darkness is already so immense. If it were to break free, it might devour the Xuanhuang Realm in an instant... becoming nourishment for the True Immortal's revival..." Mo Rubin cast a deep look at the Sea of Darkness and nodded in agreement, "If left unchecked, there might be such a day in the future." Li Fan asked curiously, "If, I mean hypothetically, the entire Xuanhuang Realm were used as nourishment, could it truly revive an Immortal's corpse?" Mo Rubin turned to look at Li Fan, remaining silent for a long time. Li Fan's eyes held no malice, only pure curiosity about the unknown. Mo Rubin pondered for a long time, then said, "Just based on energy levels. The current Xuanhuang Realm should be sufficient. After all, it has absorbed so many merged cultivation realms, even if they are only fragmented remnants..." "The living beings of the world may be destroyed, but their origins still remain." "But even if revived, it would likely only be an empty shell, a walking corpse, without its own true consciousness..." Li Fan nodded slowly, "A True Immortal's body is still an extremely formidable existence. If one could possess it, wouldn't it be possible, in a sense, to achieve True Immortality in this era?" Mo Rubin smiled at Li Fan's whimsical thought and did not take it seriously. After failing to find King Xuan Tian in the Sea of Darkness, the two decided to head to the second location: the Eye of the Celestial Beast. "The Eye of the Celestial Beast can not only probe the Star Sea but also monitor the Xuanhuang. It exists independently of the Xuanhuang Realm, connected only by an esoteric link. If the Celestial Beast were still alive, we could reach it directly. But now that the Celestial Beast is dead, reaching it will require some effort," Mo Rubin explained. Afterward, he accompanied Li Fan to Jiushan Prefecture. Looking at the nine continuous mountain ranges standing tall between heaven and earth, a hint of sadness flashed in Mo Rubin's eyes. Then, just like in his previous life, he found the immortal artifact's white jade flagpole within the underground ruins. "This is..." "An immortal artifact?" Li Fan feigned great shock. Mo Rubin was dismissive, "The Immortal Spiritual Power is depleted, leaving only the shell of an immortal artifact." "However, using it to travel to the Eye of the Celestial Beast is not difficult." Mo Rubin used the white jade flagpole as the central core and began to prepare the formation. "During my search for King Xuan Tian, I also encountered some fragments of immortal artifacts. However, they were all like this white jade flagpole, with their Immortal Spiritual Power exhausted. Some were even shattered as if they had suffered immense calamities." "Back then, what kind of calamitous scene did King Xuan Tian witness in the Immortal Realm? It was so catastrophic that even the Immortal Realm could not escape?" Li Fan mused, inquiring as he prepared. Mo Rubin, who was preparing the flagpole, paused slightly, as if lost in memory.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-352" class="calibre1">Chapter 1335: The Calamity of the Immortal Realm's Dissipation</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Regarding this question, it's not just you and I. Even the ancient Xuanhuang Realm, everyone who knew that Brother Xuanyuan ascended to immortality and then returned from the Immortal Realm, was immensely curious." Mo Rubin said with deep emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, no matter what methods they used to inquire, Brother Xuanyuan never revealed the details. He merely spoke vaguely of a terrifying calamity in the Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even we, his Dharma King brothers, and Ji Yuzhen, whom Brother Xuanyuan trusted the most, were not told."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It wasn't until Brother Xuanyuan achieved a breakthrough and decided to implement the 'luring the snakes out of their holes' plan that he briefly mentioned the calamity in the Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"He called it the 'Dao Annihilation'. Although he didn't describe the specific scenes of the Dao Annihilation calamity to us, just these two words sent chills down our spines. All of us Dharma King brothers saw a fleeting look of fear in Brother Xuanyuan's eyes..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dao Annihilation." Li Fan savored these two words, and gradually, an uncontrollable chill spread through his heart. He recalled the fragmented memories he had glimpsed within the True Immortal's flesh and blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Broken voices echoed from the towering figure above the True Immortal. "Qionglang Star Domain... Annihilation... Guarding..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan mused, "This word 'annihilation' likely refers to the 'Dao Annihilation' calamity. The Qionglang Star Domain suffered a calamity, requiring True Immortals to be dispatched to guard it, or perhaps to guard other star domains to prevent future occurrences?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan secretly speculated, "As expected, the calamity that led to the destruction of the Immortal Realm had precursors. The Immortal Realm must have attempted various self-rescue measures, but ultimately could not prevent the spread of the Dao Annihilation calamity."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">New questions arose in Li Fan's mind. Did the Dao Annihilation calamity only target and appear in the Immortal Realm? After the destruction of the Immortal Realm, did the Dao Annihilation calamity disappear without a trace? Or, one day, would it reappear in the lower Star Sea? What was the relationship between the Dao Annihilation calamity and the erosion disaster Li Fan had witnessed in the Boundless Mirror and the ruins of the Yishi Sect?</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The uncontrolled surge of True Immortal script power swept across the Star Sea, bringing destruction to a vast expanse. Starlight dimmed, transforming into the Utmost Darkness Star Sea. But... life had not been completely extinguished. Not to mention the still vibrant Xuanhuang Realm, even the seemingly dead Star Sea retained its consciousness. With the passage of time, its eventual revival was almost a certainty.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The destructive calamity encountered by the Utmost Darkness Star Sea is likely on a completely different level than the Dao Annihilation calamity." The word 'annihilation' conjured in Li Fan's mind the image of everything being utterly obliterated under the calamity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps not even fragments of the world would remain," Li Fan felt a shudder run through him.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan's thoughts drifted, Mo Rubin continued, "Brother Xuanyuan had instructed that knowing the details of the Immortal Realm's calamity would be more harmful than beneficial to us."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"He even advised us to avoid recalling its name as much as possible, because it might take the opportunity to manifest as a nightmare or a heart demon. Even if we haven't seen its true form, it can still exploit our vulnerabilities."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"He only told us the name 'Dao Annihilation' to instill a basic sense of prevention." Mo Rubin's expression was grave. "If we don't know its name, even if we encounter its signs for the first time, we wouldn't recognize its true nature. But if we know its name, even the first glimpse of its manifestation will trigger a premonition in our hearts."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In fact, Brother Xuanyuan encountered this world-ending calamity as soon as he arrived in the Immortal Realm. He learned various details about the Dao Annihilation calamity later through his interactions with the Faceless Immortal."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Enough. Let's not discuss this matter further." Mo Rubin abruptly stopped speaking.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While he was speaking, the formation of the white jade flagpole was prepared. Mo Rubin's expression became solemn as he formed hand seals. The white jade flagpole rose, emitting a halo of light that enveloped them both. "Go!" Similar to Li Fan's phantom wooden sword, the white jade flagpole aimed at the sky, adjusting its direction. Then, the flagpole body exuded specks of white light, accumulating power for a few breaths before shooting towards the sky with Li Fan and Mo Rubin. Although its speed was slightly slower than Li Fan's sword shadow divine ability, the refined, aggressive intent imbued within it, capable of breaking through all obstacles, was something Li Fan's divine ability lacked. The light column formed by the flagpole's passage was extremely thin, with no energy leakage, thus not attracting the attention of Xuanhuang Realm cultivators. Li Fan, inside the flagpole, watched the scenery of the Xuanhuang Realm rapidly recede. Even the suction of the Immortal Ruins only slightly slowed their speed. Mo Rubin, meanwhile, focused on manipulating the flagpole, occasionally dodging areas where True Immortal remnants gathered. Calculating that the white jade flagpole would not collide with that basin filled with True Immortal remnants, Li Fan patiently waited. After flying through the Star Sea for about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, the white jade flagpole suddenly halted. The light dispersed, forming a bubble-like sphere that enveloped them. Then, it violently collided with an invisible barrier layer in the void. The white light bubble perfectly acted as a buffer, dissipating the impact force. Li Fan and Mo Rubin had arrived within the Eye of the Celestial Beast.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ah!" A scream immediately echoed in the relatively small area. It wasn't from Li Fan or Mo Rubin, but from Han Zhong, a cultivator Li Fan had seen before who had erroneously entered the Eye of the Celestial Beast due to the teleportation array mishap in Jiushan Prefecture. Trapped for a long time, Han Zhong had already lost hope of escaping. Only the instinct for survival kept him clinging to life. Now, seeing other living people, he first let out a cry of excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before he could say anything more... Mo Rubin's expression changed slightly. He directly unleashed a black light that struck Han Zhong's body! Alas, Han Zhong's eyes were filled with disbelief as he vanished into nothingness inexplicably!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist brother you..." Li Fan feigned astonishment. Mo Rubin, however, first conducted a highly cautious inspection, ensuring that no fragments of Han Zhong remained. Only then did he explain, "Although I don't know why this cultivator appeared here, he has already been contaminated."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's best to be cautious and prevent infection by rashly coming into contact with him." Li Fan's expression softened slightly, still puzzled, "Contaminated?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin looked around as he spoke, "It's a very troublesome ailment. Even Brother Xuanyuan found it quite difficult to resolve."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It should be related to the calamity in the Immortal Realm..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it's generally very difficult to encounter in the Star Sea. This place is the Eye of the Celestial Beast, so the possibility of contamination is higher."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The concentration of this ailment in the lower Star Sea is extremely low. It was like this ten thousand years ago, and after ten thousand years, I also investigated it while traveling in the Star Sea. It seems there haven't been any significant changes. But the Eye of the Celestial Beast observes vast Star Domains. When the scale is magnified to a certain limit, even if the concentration is extremely low, it will truly reveal itself." Mo Rubin said, setting up several restrictions around them. These seemed specifically designed to counter this void-borne ailment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pondered Mo Rubin's words. "This ailment, due to the expansion of the observation area, its infection probability has increased... Doesn't that mean that just observing it can lead to transmission?" Li Fan was startled.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin nodded, "Precisely. This is also why I eliminated him without a second thought. Fortunately, the probability of this ailment spreading through ordinary means is low, and I've checked just now. There's no leakage. This place is safe for now."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Such a peculiar mode of transmission, and related to the Immortal Realm's calamity..." Li Fan appeared worried. "What happens after infection? I didn't see any anomalies in that trapped cultivator just now?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin conjured several more restrictions. The 'transparent bubble' that had originally tightly encased them, barely large enough for two or three people, slowly expanded as if inflating.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"There were no anomalies because the ailment was still latent within him and hadn't erupted yet. If you came into contact, you would understand its horror. The upper limit of one's spirit and life origin would be reduced. The degree of reduction would deepen with the severity of the infection. In the end, although not dead, one would become as fragile as a piece of paper."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even a gentle breeze could blow away your soul. Of course, before that, you would have to endure the various agonies brought about by the reduction of your life origin's upper limit." Mo Rubin sighed with some emotion, "Imagine, others' soft whispers sound like thunder in your ears, even causing your soul to ache and tear. An ordinary touch feels like being violently struck, leaving your flesh and blood mangled..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The normal world becomes a doomsday where terrifying calamities unfold ceaselessly in your eyes. At that point, death might be a form of release."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But because of this ailment, before being reduced to the absolute limit, in order to maintain its propagation, it would instead sustain the host's life. Unable to live, yet unable to die..." Mo Rubin shook his head slightly. "Speaking of which, this ailment is indeed quite troublesome."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan said this, but his mind flashed back to the scene in his previous life where the Heavenly Physician used a jade bottle to collect the black energy emanating from the deceased Han Zhong. "It would be troublesome if this spread in the Xuanhuang Realm," Li Fan remarked in an odd tone.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ten thousand years have passed, and this ailment has hardly spread at all. Even if it has a tendency to spread in the lower realms, the time required would certainly be extremely long," Mo Rubin said casually. His attention was focused on the Eye of the Celestial Beast.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This transparent space is the Eye of the Celestial Beast? It seems Xuan Tian is not here either." Li Fan expressed some regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin shook his head, "This is just an observation point of the Eye of the Celestial Beast. Do you know, little insects in the world are composed of countless small eyes forming a true eye? The Celestial Beast is also like this."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly understood. As Mo Rubin continued to cast spells, the transparent bubble shook violently and shrank, as if trying to expel them both.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">*Pfft!* The bubble burst, and Li Fan felt a momentary dizziness. The next moment, they were in a strange space. It was like one of countless bubbles floating on the sea. On the arc-shaped boundary, countless identical scenes of other bubbles flashed. Li Fan could even vaguely see himself and Mo Rubin in some of the bubbles outside. However, the appearances, clothing, expressions, and movements of the other 'selves' were all different from the true self. Yet, there was a strange sense of familiarity. Countless 'mes', their gazes intersecting, gave Li Fan a very peculiar feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's just a distortion caused by the simultaneous observation of countless Eyes of the Celestial Beast."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As long as we remain true to ourselves, we will not be deceived." Mo Rubin seemed accustomed to this strange scene. He surveyed their surroundings, seemingly searching for something among the myriad bubbles.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Xuanyuan did not pass down the method for manipulating the Eye of the Celestial Beast array. Fortunately, I've been here a few times before. I can only slowly search using this archaic method." Mo Rubin said with some helplessness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The number of Eyes of the Celestial Beast in this place seemed infinite. They appeared to be extremely close to each other, yet also infinitely far apart. Divine sense couldn't lock onto them; one could only observe with the naked eye. Moreover, the countless bubbles were not static. Occasionally, like waves lapping at the shore, countless bubbles simultaneously underwent irregular diffusion, changing their positions. This made most of the previous observations useless. Despite the arduousness, Mo Rubin did not show any frustration, focusing intently on his observation. At the same time, he did not forget to remind Li Fan, "Within the Eye of the Celestial Beast, laws are almost self-contained. You don't need to worry about your lifespan running out. Even if you stay here for ten thousand years, you won't age and die."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If your end of lifespan comes and you truly don't want to die, you can also hide in here. While it doesn't guarantee immortality, prolonging your life for a few thousand more years should be no problem."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded. "This Celestial Beast is truly remarkable."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is said that its size is comparable to a prefecture of the Xuanhuang Realm. Could it be that King Xuan Tian brought it back from the Immortal Realm?" Li Fan inquired.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin nodded as Li Fan had expected. "Yes and no. Back then, Brother Xuanyuan thought it was merely a dead object, an ordinary jade pendant. Unexpectedly, after encountering water, it actually developed a living aura."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"After careful nurturing, it grew larger and larger, and its combat power also increased exponentially."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am ashamed to say, if it were a fight to the death, perhaps even I would not be its opponent." A trace of nostalgia flickered in Mo Rubin's eyes. Then, perhaps thinking of the Celestial Beast that had long since died and whose bones had turned into mountains, a strong murderous intent flashed in Mo Rubin's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not respond. A silence fell once more. Li Fan, like Mo Rubin, began to search for any possible clues within the countless bubbles. Although the number of bubbles here was like the stars in the sky, innumerable, and they constantly changed, Li Fan possessed the Dao Stone's enhancement. Each bubble was different from the others. Each time he observed, after deeply imprinting it in his mind, Li Fan effectively left a unique mark on it. Regardless of how the bubbles shifted, they were all clearly distinguishable in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Time slowly passed, and the number of bubbles marked by Li Fan increased. Options were ruled out one by one, and Li Fan's gaze grew sharper. Because he discovered something quite peculiar. Compared to his own true form, in the distorted scenes on those peculiar bubbles, his body seemed to be missing a small piece. Each bubble had a different missing part. But if they were combined...</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-353" class="calibre1">Chapter 1336: The Predecessor of Gu Ming Dao</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These missing parts were all very small. If not for the Dao Stone recording each one and comparing them, Li Fan would not have so easily discovered this anomaly hidden within the myriad Eyes of the Celestial Beast.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mo Rubin said earlier that the difference in the scenes was due to the distortions caused by the observation of different Eyes of the Celestial Beast..." Li Fan's gaze seemed to pierce through these countless bubbles, reaching towards the very back.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"These missing pieces can actually be seen as blind spots of the Eyes of the Celestial Beast. Or rather, an invisible entity occupies a fixed position within the observation range of the Celestial Beast's vision. Even with the observation of hundreds or thousands of fields of vision, its entirety cannot be grasped. Only by stitching together the blind spots of all the Eyes of the Celestial Beast..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's thoughts surged, and in his mind, those small fragments slowly pieced together, eventually forming a circuitous, profoundly mysterious, and extremely complex character! To call it a character was an understatement; before Li Fan's eyes, it even resembled a distorted human figure!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This human figure character was formless and intangible, yet it fell within the observation range of the Eyes of the Celestial Beast. Any single Eye of the Celestial Beast, let alone grasping its entirety, couldn't even detect the presence of the human figure character. However, it occupied a portion of the field of vision. It was like a shadow cast by an object illuminated from different angles. Even if one couldn't perceive the object's original form by 'looking,' by combining all the shadow patterns and performing reverse calculations, the formless and intangible entity could be reconstructed!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This character..." Li Fan suppressed the shock in his heart and did not reveal any abnormality before Mo Rubin.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This human figure character was not a True Immortal script. But its essence might be no different from a True Immortal script. The True Immortal scripts such as 'Chaos,' 'Hunger,' and 'Creation' were projections of the Dao, concrete manifestations of power. And this human figure character before him was also a projection of a certain Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The moment cultivators observe a True Immortal script, the specific power it represents naturally appears in their minds. 'Hunger,' 'Chaos,' 'Creation,' and even that mysterious character representing the distinction between Immortals and mortals, are all like this. The reason is that all True Immortal scripts are the engravings and annotations of the Dao by that 'Inscription Dao Immortal.' The Great Dao is originally formless, yet the Inscription Dao Immortal could materialize its essence into characters, making it immensely easier for mortals to perceive and understand."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"But this human figure character did not..." Li Fan slowly pondered the vast power contained within the character. "Perhaps it was naturally formed, a projection of a certain Dao's power. Or perhaps it was the attempt of another True Immortal at 'Inscribing Dao'."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, this one was clearly far inferior to the later Inscription Dao Immortal!" The reason for judging that this character appeared before the Inscription Dao Immortal was that the Dao of True Immortals does not tolerate others. If the Inscription Dao Immortal already existed, no other 'Inscription Dao' attempts would appear in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"At the moment of action, terrifying, nameless True Immortal power would have mercilessly crushed it."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The gap between this unknown practitioner and the true Inscription Dao Immortal was like that between two painters trying to record the mountains and rivers of the world with their brushes. The Inscription Dao Immortal's painting was lifelike, making the viewer feel almost as if they were there. But that practitioner's work was like a child's doodle, an abstract combination of lines, let alone resembling the actual subject, it was incredibly difficult even to ascertain what the painting was meant to depict.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gazed at the distorted human figure character for a long time, lost in silent contemplation. Yet, he did not feel any disdain due to this supposedly crude method of inscribing Dao. Only because the object this human figure character attempted to inscribe... was the origin Dao itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Having witnessed Transformation of Creation, the change between Immortals and mortals, and even the change between True and False, Li Fan's ability to discern and identify the rank of True Immortal scripts was probably unmatched even by True Immortals.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan vaguely sensed that despite the crude method of inscribing Dao, it did not affect the rank of the origin Dao that this distorted human figure character attempted to inscribe. "Perhaps it is on par with the change between Immortals and mortals, or even above Creation."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A barely perceptible glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes. "The Celestial Beast was formed from a jade pendant brought back from the Immortal Realm by King Xuan Tian in the past. Yet, after encountering water, it surprisingly transformed into a living being."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it be due to the character hidden within this jade pendant?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The method of discovering this hidden human figure character was both difficult and simple. Even if King Xuan Tian did not possess the Dao Stone, Li Fan did not believe that with his Half-Immortal strength, he could not have discovered this hidden secret. Similarly, the Sea of Darkness and the Ghost Tribe were all King Xuan Tian's doing. That character representing the distinction between Immortals and mortals, it was unlikely he wouldn't have noticed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps King Xuan Tian's breakthrough back then relied on the power of these two characters," Li Fan mused inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the inscription method of this human figure character was too crude, Li Fan could not comprehend anything from it for the time being. He could only deeply engrave it in his mind for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the whereabouts of King Xuan Tian... Li Fan had observed all the Eyes of the Celestial Beast. As expected, there were no signs of King Xuan Tian having been there. However, Li Fan did not voice this, remaining silent as he began to ponder how to decipher this array.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Star Crossing Great Array was based on ancient immortal arrays, modified by King Xuan Tian. Given that he already knew about the 'Spirit Gathering Ascension Array,' it was not impossible for Li Fan to decipher the Eye of the Celestial Beast array with the aid of the End Dissolution Disc. Especially since Mo Rubin had directly brought Li Fan into the array's interior, all the operational details of the array were laid bare.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the silence, Li Fan's deciphering progress steadily increased. Mo Rubin completed his observation of all the Eyes of the Celestial Beast only twice as long as Li Fan. A clear look of disappointment flashed across his face, unhidden.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not here either?" Li Fan spoke at the opportune moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin shook his head and sighed; "He didn't even come here to seek refuge."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Both locations I deduced where Brother Xuanyuan might be hiding have turned out to be empty," Mo Rubin's expression was rather grim.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then shall we proceed to the next location?" Mo Rubin, however, rejected Li Fan's suggestion. "The Eye of the Celestial Beast observes the Star Sea externally and the Xuanhuang internally. Since we are here, why abandon its use?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin stared at the constantly shifting myriad Eyes of the Celestial Beast and said softly. "Didn't you say earlier that King Xuan Tian didn't pass down the method for manipulating it? Can you still utilize the power of the Eye of the Celestial Beast?" Li Fan asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin replied with a proud tone: "After all, it is a part of the Star Crossing Great Array. As the saying goes, 'ten thousand changes, all stemming from the same source.' As long as you give me some time, it's not difficult to harness some of its power."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan couldn't help but praise, "Daoist brother is truly talented. How much time do you specifically need?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Within three to five months, it will certainly be done," Mo Rubin said in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded slightly. After appearing to ponder for a moment, he suggested, "It would be pointless for me to just wait here. Why don't I return to the Xuanhuang Realm first and conduct a thorough search, looking for any loopholes? Perhaps I can find other clues."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin sized up Li Fan and finally agreed, "Very well."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Throwing out a jade talisman, Mo Rubin said, "Take this with you. If I have any results, I will notify you immediately."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan took the jade talisman and cupped his hands, "Then please, Daoist brother, escort me out of the Eye of the Celestial Beast array first."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mo Rubin nodded and formed a hand seal. Li Fan's vision blurred, and he suddenly felt as if he had appeared in another miniature bubble. The bubble continuously shrank, gradually transforming into a thin film that enveloped Li Fan's body. Finally, the film tore apart, and in moments, Li Fan was back within the Xuanhuang Realm, in Jiushan Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"From now on, coming here won't be as troublesome. We can directly transfer through the Celestial Beast's body." "Although the Celestial Beast is dead, its essence remains." Mo Rubin's voice echoed in Li Fan's ears before slowly fading away.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked up, his gaze seeming to pierce through space and time, directly towards the Eye of the Celestial Beast outside the void. After checking and confirming that Mo Rubin had not left any marks or ulterior motives on him, Li Fan narrowed his eyes and grumbled inwardly, "He agreed quite readily." "Perhaps he was just eager to get rid of me."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan vaguely sensed that Mo Rubin had not exerted his full strength within the Eye of the Celestial Beast array, possibly holding back some undisclosed skills. Therefore, he went along with the flow, proactively suggesting his departure. After all, with the aid of the End Dissolution Disc, he should be able to decipher the Eye of the Celestial Beast array even faster than Mo Rubin.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"If he can find King Xuan Tian's trace, that would be even better." "If not, at least he can contribute to the sublimation of the Xuanhuang Realm." The Dharma King of the Xuan Tian Sect was somewhat more useful than Yin Shangren or Xu Ke. Naturally, he couldn't be wasted.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With this thought, Li Fan activated the phantom wooden sword, and the next moment, he had returned to the Great Profound Minor World. The moment he returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, he sensed that Yin Shangren, who had gone missing during the reverberating Star Power storm, had safely returned. However, as the instigator of the disturbance, Bai Hua's feelings towards him had shifted from friendly to hostile. The two were confronting each other above the Dao Platform. Bai Hua appeared solemn, clearly demanding an explanation from Yin Shangren. Yin Shangren, on the other hand, kept his eyes closed, offering no explanation, yet exuding no hostility.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at Yin Shangren, and a peculiar sensation arose in his heart. Having interacted with Yin Shangren for so many lifetimes, with a total of over a century of shared time, Li Fan understood him better than anyone else in the world. Li Fan easily perceived the wondrous changes that had occurred within Yin Shangren. Yin Shangren was a 'World Soul,' a remnant residue from the Xuanhuang Realm's inability to absorb the impurities during the process of devouring and merging with other destroyed cultivation realms. Because Yin Shangren's presence was often accompanied by an aura of strangeness and deathliness. But now... wisps of unique vitality emanated from this World Soul aggregate!</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan couldn't help but be astonished. He immediately revealed himself, appearing before Yin Shangren. "Congratulations, Daoist friend, you have benefited from disaster!" Li Fan observed him carefully for a moment, then said softly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Yin Shangren slowly opened his eyes, "Without the Saint Master's help, I might never have reached the borders of the Star Sea, let alone obtained this fortuitous encounter!" Yin Shangren expressed his sincere gratitude. And the instant Li Fan saw his eyes, he understood why, when facing Bai Hua earlier, the latter had refused to open his eyes. Both eyes were black and white. The black one exuded vigorous vitality, while the white one exuded endless deathly aura.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment Li Fan's gaze met the black and white eyes, he felt as if he were pulled into an boundless illusion. Countless lives were born, and then destroyed amidst various calamities. Life and death underwent reincarnation and evolution at an terrifying speed. Li Fan even sensed that his 'psychological age' bar, which had never been affected by illusions, had its numbers leap rapidly the moment he fell into the black and white vortex. Li Fan was already in such a state, and Bai Hua's appearance was even worse. Even merely glancing indirectly, her normally indestructible vitreous body flickered unstably like a candle in the wind, on the verge of extinguishing! Fortunately, Yin Shangren also sensed the changes happening to Li Fan and Bai Hua. Furthermore, he harbored no intention of harming them. With some slowness and difficulty, he closed his black and white eyes. The storm of life and death illusions gradually subsided, and Li Fan and Bai Hua returned to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"You..." Bai Hua pointed at Yin Shangren with astonishment, her face unable to conceal her fright. She could hardly believe that this person, whose strength was comparable to hers just a few days ago, had undergone such earth-shattering changes in merely a few days.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan asked with great interest, "What is this vitality on you? The foot of the high wall, among the continuous Great Wall of remnant realms, should only consist of destroyed worlds. How can there be such immense vitality hidden there?"</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren paused and slowly explained, "Precisely because I discovered the vitality within that remnant realm, I acted recklessly. In fact, at that time, I was already controlled by instinct and acted involuntarily for a short period."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan frowned upon hearing this. "Even if I absorb the vitality of the black and white dual pearls now, I still don't know its origin. However, I can show the Saint Master the source of this vitality..." Yin Shangren said word by word.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan nodded, "The Great Profound Minor World is still too fragile." The phantom wooden sword was unsheathed, carrying Yin Shangren and Bai Hua, and arrived in the void of the Xuanhuang Realm. Catalyzed by the boundless vitality, his partially successful 'Foundation Establishment through Self' showed signs of repair. The true Dao foundation within his body was slowly integrating with himself, causing the signature double-echoing voice of Yin Shangren to cease.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With a solemn expression, Yin Shangren turned his head, avoiding Li Fan and their positions. He opened his black and white eyes again. Then, he reached out his left hand, inserted two fingers into his eye sockets, and with a slight pull, directly removed the two eyeballs! There was no gushing blood, only two black and white spheres, constantly spinning in the void! After leaving Yin Shangren's body, these black and white spheres gradually moved closer to each other. However, Yin Shangren's palm remained between them, preventing them from adhering and merging.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The source of vitality is these two black and white pearls?" Bai Hua asked, seeing this bizarre scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not just vitality. The source of deathly aura is also from here." With the dual pearls removed from his body, Yin Shangren's speech became somewhat difficult for some reason. The black and white pearls continuously emitted their unique energy towards their surroundings. However, due to mutual attraction and restraint, they did not explosively diffuse into the void but formed a Tai Chi-like vortex, achieving a strange balance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the black and white dual pearls, vaguely sensing a familiar aura from them.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-354" class="calibre1">Chapter 1337: Tai Jia Realm Divine Ability</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In his previous life, Li Fan's Saint Embryo clone followed the Profound Immortal Boat on an expedition to the Xuanhuang Realm, only to fall into Transmitting Dharma's trap. He encountered a terrifying Immortal Realm overseer who, with a single glance, stripped the Immortal Boat of one-tenth of its life force. Like a giant cauldron boiling, like an abyss flowing over, it transformed a world frozen with countless cultivators into a Yin-Yang Orb.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Yin-Yang Orb, two worlds were divided. One was a boundless, desolate icy ocean. The opposite of this desolate world was a vibrant, lively sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Initially, when Li Fan mistakenly entered the small world within the Yin-Yang Orb, he mistook it for the Daoist sanctuary of the 'Rebirth Heavenly Venerate' of the Xuanhuang Realm. This was because the world within, with its cycles of yin and yang, life and death, and the reversal of fortune, indeed corresponded to the so-called phenomenon of reversing life and death.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as Li Fan's vision gradually improved and he witnessed numerous genuine immortal arrays, he began to doubt his initial judgment. The array within the Yin-Yang Orb, though extraordinarily profound, was something Li Fan could comprehend the secrets of at first glance. Clearly, it was far from reaching the category of an immortal array.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The cycle of life and death within the Yin-Yang Orb was not achieved through this Reverse Life and Death Great Array, but solely through the origin power within the Yin-Yang world, derived from the Immortal Realm overseer's power. The Reverse Life and Death Great Array acted more like a catalyst, accelerating the process of reversing life and death.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In his previous life, the Saint Emperor caused immense chaos in the Xuanhuang Realm, and subsequently, the Xuanhuang Realm was plunged into a desperate situation of world-ending peril within the Myriad Things Return to Void Great Array. Transmitting Dharma and Heavenly Physician exerted all their efforts to resist, yet throughout the entire process, the mysterious 'Rebirth Heavenly Venerate' never appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This might have been due to Lan Yu choosing to venture into the Star Sea for enlightenment, and the true Rebirth Heavenly Venerate not yet succeeding in reversing the natural order. However, Li Fan believed that even if the Rebirth Heavenly Venerate were born, he would likely not intervene in his world-ending actions. There were deep connections between the Rebirth Heavenly Venerate and the overseer.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The overseer bore the mission of the Immortal Realm, and besides monitoring anomalies in the Xuanhuang Realm, he also seemed responsible for collecting all different types of humans that had appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm. As for the Rebirth Heavenly Venerate... It was as if he had shed the constraints of his Immortal Realm mission and acted solely for his own benefit.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The overseer that Li Fan and the Profound Immortal Boat encountered lacked personal consciousness, acting purely on instinct or pre-established rules, almost like a puppet. It was truly difficult for such an entity to bear the responsibility of an overseer. Therefore, Li Fan conjectured that perhaps the True Spirit of the overseer had already left its original vessel, seeking freedom from its Immortal Realm duties after the destruction of the Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The backlash faced by the Great Heavenly Venerate of Xuanhuang after dereliction of duty in his previous life indicated that even after the Immortal Realm's destruction, the imposed constraints remained. No one would wish to bear a shackle forever. Theoretically speaking, it was entirely reasonable for the overseer of the Xuanhuang Realm to seek freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In my previous life, I used a fake True Immortal remnant to lure the Transmitting Dharma cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance into the Yin-Yang Realm, ultimately leading to their simultaneous demise. Yet, the Myriad Immortals Alliance acted as if nothing had happened. This indicates that Transmitting Dharma, or Heavenly Physician, must also know the true nature of this Rebirth Heavenly Venerate. Perhaps even Li Fan suspects that with Heavenly Physician's assistance, the transformation from an Immortal Realm overseer to the Rebirth Heavenly Venerate occurred..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, in the present, the black and white dual orbs formed by Yin Shangren after detaching his black and white eyes emitted energy fluctuations that were almost identical to the Yin-Yang Orb. However, within these black and white dual orbs, life and death were clearly distinguished. They had not yet reached the level of the Xuanhuang Realm's Yin-Yang Orb, where life and death cycled ceaselessly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stared at the black and white dual orbs, remaining silent for a long time. After a while, he finally spoke, "There is a similar creation in a secret realm somewhere in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, the black and white life and death are intertwined, and compared to your mere dual life and death orbs, it is even more wondrous. Within that Yin-Yang Orb, countless corpses were frozen. I wonder..." Li Fan's gaze was intense.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren displayed the black and white dual orbs and then reabsorbed them into his body, transforming back into normal eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The white orb did indeed contain frozen corpses. But that was before the world's destruction."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the world died, those frozen corpses gradually melted away, transforming into the purest deathly aura..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan murmured inwardly, "This should be the difference caused by the absence of an overseer."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Among the many cultivation realms in the lower Star Sea, the Xuanhuang Realm is clearly unique. Not only did it have an appointment from the Immortal Realm, but it also had the Great Heavenly Venerate and an overseer. Furthermore, a True Immortal once personally visited. Although the reason is unknown, this True Immortal surprisingly perished..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"And the world where Yin Shangren obtained the black and white dual orbs was also within the monitoring range of the Immortal Realm, but its level was somewhat lower than that of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan intended to eventually interact with the Rebirth Heavenly Venerate, who was suspected of shedding its physical form and escaping like a cicada shedding its shell, but his main goal in this life was Dao Integration by merging with the Heavenly Immortal Souls of the Super Xuanhuang Realm, so he aimed to avoid unnecessary variables.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren continued, "I am a World Soul. Originally, I thought I could only survive in this state of insignificant remnants for the rest of my life, but the moment I sensed the vast vitality within these black and white dual orbs, a strong premonition surged in my heart..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As he spoke, the vitality within Yin Shangren's black eye spun faster.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps there is no absolute decay in the world. The reason for being a remnant soul is merely the cessation of vitality. As long as sufficient vitality is infused..." As he spoke, Yin Shangren's complexion became increasingly rosy, appearing more and more like a normal human cultivator.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan narrowed his eyes and saw that things were not that simple. As Li Fan had predicted, as if agitated by the strong vitality emanating from him, the previously calm gray eye began to spin faster. Wisps of desolate, decaying deathly aura emerged from Yin Shangren's body, soon neutralizing and suppressing the original vitality. A scent of decay slowly emanated from Yin Shangren's body.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren coughed a few times, and the storm within his black and white eyes gradually subsided, revealing a hint of helplessness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua observed this, deep in thought, a hint of schadenfreude flashing in her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan spoke directly, "Life and death appear to be opposites, but in reality, they are one. You wish to incite vitality but suppress deathly aura; this will only be counterproductive."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The living are the root of the dead. The dead are the fruit of the living. Digging at the root will surely disturb the fruit. Taking the fruit, however, may not harm the root..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, perfectly embodying the role of the Saint Master, actually began to expound the Dao to Yin Shangren on the spot. Yin Shangren, already possessing extraordinary comprehension, and now holding the black and white dual pearls of life and death, encountered no obstacles in understanding Li Fan's deliberately profound statements. The calm eyes showed faster and faster circulation of black and white energies.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua also seemed to possess a keen talent for the Dao of Life and Death, and as she listened intently, she appeared to reap considerable rewards. The lecture lasted for a full half-day, practically exhausting all of Li Fan's stored knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, Li Fan waved his hand, transmitting the Reverse Life and Death Great Array into the sea of consciousness of the two. This Reverse Life and Death Great Array was a further derivation by the End Dissolution Disc based on the original array within the Yin-Yang Orb, representing the pinnacle of practical application of the Dao of Life and Death within the Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment they came into contact with this array, Yin Shangren's face showed undisguised astonishment and joy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Life and death are opposites, but you might be able to use this array to slowly transform the infinite deathly aura within the white pearl into vitality. However, you must pay attention to the balance between life and death."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan glanced at Bai Hua and continued, "The vitality derived should be consumed as quickly as possible. Besides cleansing your own decay, perhaps it can also help fellow Daoist Bai."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua's body trembled slightly, unsure what secret of hers Li Fan had discovered.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren nodded slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"By the way, Saint Master, when I absorbed the black and white dual pearls, I also learned some information about this destroyed world."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although not much, it is very interesting."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After briefly organizing the Reverse Life and Death Great Array, Yin Shangren proactively stated, "This world is called [Tai Jia]."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Before its destruction, although its scale was not large, it was an extremely powerful cultivation world in the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is because the Tai Jia Realm was an extremely rare cultivation world that lacked a world's Dao of Heaven."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The cultivators within practiced the [Tai Jia Divine Technique], said to allow them to bypass the non-existent Dao of Heaven and directly communicate with the consciousness of the Star Sea's origin, drawing upon the power of the Star Sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren's eyes flashed with a flicker of astonishment. From some fragmented images he displayed, the divine abilities of the cultivators in the Tai Jia Realm were indeed terrifying. Swords flew like rivers, fists shook worlds. They could traverse the Star Sea with their bare physical bodies...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren's tone suddenly changed, "However, precisely because they directly communicated with the origin intent of the Star Sea, they became the first to be affected when the True Immortal script power erupted in the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea divine power they relied on lost its efficacy. The Tai Jia Realm, once renowned in the Star Sea, perished at a much faster rate than ordinary cultivation realms."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The most laughable thing is that at the moment of Tai Jia Realm's complete destruction, some cultivators of Tai Jia chose not to fight to the death. Instead, they knelt down and continued to beg for communication with the origin of the Star Sea..." Yin Shangren shook his head, filled with disdain.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua also said, "As cultivators, we advocate for the power to reside within ourselves. Relying on the power of the Star Sea, though it may grant temporary might, ultimately turns to dust when calamity strikes."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In fact, the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm who seek longevity are also the same..." Bai Hua suddenly paused here. Because she suddenly remembered their actions, pushing for the Xuanhuang Realm's ascension and wanting to ride the trend to improve their own strength and realm, seemed to have no fundamental difference from the longevity cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm and the cultivators of the Tai Jia Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, of course, saw the reason for Bai Hua's sudden pause. He smiled slightly, "There are still differences."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The power fed back to us after the Xuanhuang Realm's transformation ultimately belongs to ourselves. It's a one-time transaction; even if we turn against the Xuanhuang Realm in the future, this bestowed power cannot be recalled."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for the cultivators of the Tai Jia Realm..." Li Fan shook his head, offering no comment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, the [Tai Jia Divine Technique], which directly communicates with the origin intent of the Star Sea, does have some merit."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had previously taken Yin Shangren and the others to see the reviving origin intent of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang Realm is not completely isolated. After all, it is still within the Star Sea. If its sublimation can gain the support of the Star Sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren also perceived the potential usefulness of the Tai Jia Divine Technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, what I obtained from the black and white dual pearls are only fragmented memories," he said with regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren then haltingly recounted the incomplete [Tai Jia] Divine Technique. It was obscure and extremely strange, completely different from ordinary cultivation methods.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, encountering this type of technique for the first time, became quite interested.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The key essence of this technique is to communicate with the origin intent of the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ten thousand years ago, when the Star Sea was at its strongest, even Half-Immortals were like ants in the eyes of the Star Sea, let alone ordinary cultivators. To communicate with the consciousness of the Star Sea was naturally extremely difficult," Li Fan said slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren nodded in agreement, "Indeed, the cultivation of the Tai Jia Divine Technique is extremely difficult, with only one in ten million succeeding. But once one masters it, the energy they can stir with each move and stance far surpasses that of normal cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled, "However, times have changed. The Star Sea is destroyed, and its origin intent is being reborn from ruins. Currently, it's like a reincarnated great being in its infancy..."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A sharp glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes, his tone filled with confidence, "The situation has reversed. Communicating with it now would be greatly reduced in difficulty."</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let me try first!" The phantom wooden sword was unsheathed, and Li Fan rode the sword, flying away. In an instant, he traversed half of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea and arrived at the center of the Star Sea. Here, the reviving origin intent of the Star Sea was most active.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stood quietly in the void. He did not directly activate the incomplete [Golden Armor Divine Technique]. What he had said was indeed true. However, he had not spoken the whole truth. Even with the revival of the Star Sea's consciousness, the gap between it and cultivators remained like the gulf between heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, only a 'Child of Destiny' like the Saint Emperor, who could potentially promote the revival of the entire Star Sea, could directly converse with the Star Sea's consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for ordinary cultivators, to achieve the same effect as the Saint Emperor...</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then, we must first make the Star Sea see us!" Li Fan's eyes flashed with a sharp glint. The Ascension Array was instantly set up. A 'mountain peak' rose from the center of the Star Sea. Slowly ascending.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stood atop the mountain peak, gazing upwards. Just like the ancient emperors who ascended mountains to perform 封禅 rituals, wanting to get closer to the heavens, Li Fan sought to stand higher, increasing his 'momentum' to make himself more conspicuous in the eyes of the Star Sea's origin intent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensing that the Ascension Array's ascent had reached its limit. Li Fan began to silently recite the Tai Jia Divine Technique. Although incomplete, its efficacy in communicating with the Star Sea's consciousness still existed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A thought drifted upwards, heading directly towards the source of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">*Boom!* Li Fan instantly felt as if he had fallen into a brilliant river of stars.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-355" class="calibre1">Chapter 1338: Ten Thousand Years of Favorability</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"As if my body has become the universe, my will gallops through the galaxies. Tai Jia has no limits, spirit roams; Tai Jia has no change, spirit transforms; Tai Jia has no void, spirit transcends..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan chanted silently in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And in his field of vision, just like the previous experience of the Saint Emperor, the seemingly utterly dark and desolate Star Sea, suddenly lit up with scattered points of light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this time, it was different from directly contacting the True Will of the Star Sea's origin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the "Tai Jia Divine Technique" acting as a "translator" between them, Li Fan felt that the Star Sea's origin's True Will naturally developed a certain degree of goodwill towards him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only did the contempt for ant-like beings from the Star Sea diminish and disappear, but Li Fan even sensed that the consciousness of the Star Sea was listening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The gap between cultivators and the vast Star Sea, how immense is it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, relying on the "Tai Jia Divine Technique," it could significantly reduce this difference! This was, of course, partly due to the Star Sea being in a new ecological state of recovery after its destruction, and Li Fan's strength already standing at the pinnacle of the mortal Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it had to be said, the "Tai Jia Divine Technique" was indeed an extremely profound divine ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Only by reaching a very high level of understanding of the Star Sea's essence can one create such a divine ability."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps the founder of this divine technique has already ascended to immortality too." A thought suddenly flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he did not forget the purpose of this communication.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maintaining the state of casting the Tai Jia Divine Technique, Li Fan's expression was solemn. First, he praised the greatness of the Star Sea and its recovery from destruction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he elaborated on the current state of desolation in the Star Sea, and emphasized the only place where life was found: the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, Li Fan sincerely prayed to the Star Sea's consciousness, wishing to obtain its help in the sublimation of the Xuanhuang Realm and its escape from the Immortal Ruins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like an ancient emperor sacrificing and praying to the heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After Li Fan finished narrating his plea, he remained silent, patiently waiting for the response from the Star Sea's origin consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if he had presented it with a difficult problem, the Star Sea's consciousness did not reply for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan felt that the connection between them had not been broken, so he continued to stand and wait.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the period of connection with the Star Sea's consciousness, various thoughts and insights about the Dao of the Star Sea poured in. It was as if he had fallen into the legendary state of "unity of heaven and humanity," and every moment felt like an epiphany.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, what Li Fan felt was a bit regrettable was that these insights were like ripples on a vast sea. Although they rose and fell, as the waves crashed, they quickly dissolved back into the water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not my own comprehension, but a phenomenon that naturally arises after being in a special state. As for how much can be remembered in the end, it depends on one's own fortune..." Li Fan understood in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immersed in this state of near enlightenment, time passed without anyone knowing. The Star Sea's consciousness finally gave an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, Li Fan was forcibly expelled and his connection with the Star Sea's consciousness was severed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The "Tai Jia Divine Technique." This could not be used again for a period of time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A peculiar summoning ritual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These two insights appeared simultaneously in Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems the principle of the Tai Jia Divine Technique is to consume the goodwill of the Star Sea's origin consciousness. And this goodwill increases slowly over time. Since the destruction of Tai Jia, no cultivator has used this Tai Jia Divine Technique for ten thousand years. Therefore, the goodwill accumulated over these years has reached an astonishing level. That's why I felt the Star Sea was listening just now..." Li Fan, having completed a communication ritual with the Star Sea, realized something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, the goodwill accumulated over the years has been completely depleted with my request. At least in the remaining twenty years of this life, I can no longer make it do anything that can be exploited. But it doesn't matter, after all, I have mastered this Tai Jia Divine Technique. In the next life, there will be another ten thousand years of goodwill for me to squander."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps the goodwill accumulated over ten thousand years was truly abundant. Or perhaps the sublimation of the Xuanhuang Realm was also beneficial to the overall recovery of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the Star Sea's consciousness agreed to Li Fan's request and would provide help in the matter of Xuanhuang's sublimation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ritual it transmitted was the method for receiving the Star Sea's assistance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Once the ritual is set up, the Star Sea will directly bestow its great power."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even a nascent Star Sea is far from comparable to the Xuanhuang Realm, which has merged myriad worlds."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With an additional layer of assistance, the Xuanhuang sublimation plan has a greater chance of success."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A peculiar look flashed in Li Fan's eyes: "I just don't know if this ritual will still be useful in the next life?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A moment later, Li Fan vaguely shook his head, dismissing his own thought: "This ritual is, in essence, just a signal transmitter. Whether to contribute or not is up to the Star Sea's consciousness itself. Without the prior communication foundation, the Star Sea would likely only feel disturbed and then become angry. Not only would there be no Star Sea assistance, but it might even bring down disasters as punishment."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all the goodwill was consumed, in the eyes of the Star Sea, Li Fan became no different from any other cultivator. And the duration of the ascending array had reached its limit, so Li Fan immediately drove his wooden sword phantom and left. Letting the formation collapse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The collapse of the towering peak stirred up some ripples in the central Star Sea. After the commotion gradually subsided, a trace of extremely faint black energy, unnoticed, appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was exactly the same as the trace of black energy that had appeared before when Li Fan used the ascending array for the sublimation experiment of a minor world, causing the minor world to fall from a great height and be annihilated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this time, there was no minor world falling. The black energy was born purely because this place was close to the most active area of the Star Sea's origin consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the trace of black energy that was later eaten by the Dharma Transmitter Jiang, this trace in the center of the Star Sea seemed much weaker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, "weak" was undoubtedly just an illusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This trace of black energy steadily grew stronger as time passed. The area it enveloped caused the Star Sea, which had begun to revive its vitality, to completely fall into nothingness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But strangely, the Star Sea's origin consciousness did not discover the existence of this worm-like black energy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was allowed to continuously devour the Star Sea's life force, and the consciousness was helpless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The growth rate of the black energy was extremely slow in the initial stage. However, as it devoured more areas of the Star Sea, its expansion capability also continuously strengthened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was expected that this black energy of unknown origin would soon ravage the Star Sea at an extremely terrifying speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But at this moment, the black energy was still quietly developing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surviving beings in the Star Sea were all unaware of this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan, the instigator, was also unaware of the disaster he had casually created.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, he had already returned to the Xuanhuang Realm and recounted his experiences in the central Star Sea to Yin Shangren and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua exclaimed repeatedly, her eyes filled with joy: "The goodwill accumulated over ten thousand years in Tai Jia has now become a dowry for the Xuanhuang Realm. With the help of the Star Sea's consciousness, the sublimation of Xuanhuang is within reach!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren was much calmer: "Before, I also found world fragments near the Tai Jia fragments that could serve as medicinal guides for Xuanhuang."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, because I rashly devoured the Tai Jia fragments, the stability of the remnant wall was affected. I'm afraid we'll have to wait a while longer, until the reverberating Star Power storm completely passes, before we can proceed with the next step."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua was even more delighted: "Indeed, everything is going smoothly. It seems that at most half a year, we can officially start the Xuanhuang sublimation plan."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled: "It's not that simple. Although we have the Star Sea's assistance, we cannot be careless. The great power of the Star Sea is like a powerful tonic. If taken correctly, it will cure the illness. But if not..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The body cannot withstand excessive nourishment and will be harmed instead!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua became solemn upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using the principles of the "unity of heaven and man," Li Fan once again lectured the two, assigning them tasks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xu Ke is still below the high wall, his vitality is not extinguished, and he should have had another fortunate encounter. Since you caused the reverberating Star Power storm, you should go and retrieve him!" Li Fan said to Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So it should be!" Yin Shangren nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then looked at Bai Hua: "During your trip to the Star Sea border, Yin Shangren and Xu Ke both had their gains, but although you returned safely, you did not have any fortunate encounters..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua gave a wry smile, and then as if thinking of something, looked at Li Fan with a hint of anticipation in her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In the Star Sea, fortunate encounters are not only found below the high wall. Go and check this place, perhaps you will have some gains." Li Fan told her a location not far from the Xuanhuang Realm in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, his expression enigmatic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Remember, don't be greedy, safety first. If you have no fate with it, just return."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua firmly remembered the location Li Fan had given her, then cupped her hands in thanks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching the two disappear one after another, and calculating that the time was almost up, Li Fan lazily headed back towards the Profound Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The location Li Fan had pointed out to Bai Hua was a natural "highland" outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While flying, Li Fan passed by there several times. Although he had found nothing on the surface, he had always felt that there might be some hidden secret there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the brief period of communication with the Star Sea's consciousness, Li Fan was even more certain of his judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, he first let Bai Hua go and investigate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The highlands that had been confirmed in the Star Sea, the high wall, and the Utmost Darkness Sea, all posed dangers. Even though he now possessed sufficient self-preservation abilities, Li Fan still would not rush into danger himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after, he arrived outside the Profound Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He deliberately released his aura, and soon the elders of the Immortal Boat arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They surrounded Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Li Fan return as promised, they all breathed a sigh of relief first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, their expressions turned solemn, and they began to discuss important matters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Daoist friend, what did Da Qi say...?" Seeing Dao Sheng was the first to speak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A trace of anger flashed in Li Fan's eyes: "Those who are greedy for petty gains! Let's not mention it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong smiled slightly, his eyes flickering: "It seems your persuasion failed?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Something like that," Li Fan snorted coldly. "I have already told my master about my observations below the high wall, but they still remained unconvinced."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"My master even told me that there are actually quite a few such high points in the Star Sea. However, compared to the height of the high wall, the height of these high points is like the difference between the peak of a mountain on the ground and the firmament..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To cross it is a fool's dream!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words caused the expressions of all the elders of the Immortal Boat to change slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Without special means, simply borrowing height cannot cross the high wall," Zhong Daogong said with a half-smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However... Daoist friend just said that there are many high points in the Star Sea?" Zhong Daogong suddenly changed the subject and asked, his expression somewhat serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded: "Yes. My master even personally took me to one of them. It was indeed true. Although it was lower than the location on the remnant realm Great Wall, it could still overlook the high wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong remained silent for a long time upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After some discussion with the other elders, he finally said slowly: "It seems we, the Immortal Boat, have underestimated the world. How could civilizations that have survived the great calamity be simple?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They are strong, but cowardly. They lack the courage to even try," Li Fan retorted coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong, on the other hand, took the initiative to defend Da Qi, who was not present: "Daoist friend, you are oversimplifying things."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even with traces left by predecessors, crossing the high wall still requires a civilization to exert all its efforts. It's not something that can be described as simply trying."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Having survived safely in the Star Sea for tens of thousands of years, perhaps they will continue to survive. There is no need to take such risks. Of course, Daoist friend's lifespan is nearing its end, and wanting to seek the truth of the Dao before dying is understandable," Zhong Daogong spoke eloquently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan snorted coldly again but did not argue further.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The atmosphere between them became somewhat strained for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Jian Dao Sheng who spoke again: "Of course, Daoist friend, rest assured. Our Immortal Boat's determination to cross the high wall has never changed. Cooperating with us is probably your only choice if you want to achieve your wish."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan then seemed to remember something, furrowed his brow, and asked, "What is the reason for your Immortal Boat's obsession? Is it only because there is another half of an Immortal Boat outside the high wall?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Dao Sheng did not answer directly, he hinted: "Before this, the Immortal Boat's situation was similar to yours. And now, although there might be a change, we are already in a difficult position."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, with the precedent of the Shang Immortal Boat, it is not as difficult as we imagined to recreate the feat of crossing the high wall..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Limited to our Profound Immortal Boat," Zhong Daogong added.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes and looked at the elders of the Immortal Boat: "It seems your Immortal Boat still has secrets."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong smiled without speaking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since you are so confident, why should I be timid?" Li Fan said solemnly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I will do my best to assist the Immortal Boat in its success. Everything I have learned from Da Qi in my life was originally not meant to be passed on. But now..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, the elders of the Immortal Boat couldn't help but show a flicker of joy in their eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To be honest, besides True Immortal scripts, I have studied the Dao of Formations the most. Furthermore, I have mastered an ancient divine ability that can communicate with the Star Sea's consciousness..." Li Fan said proudly, introducing himself to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat listened, their eyes shining with excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Da Qi's research on True Immortal scripts, was it the highest achievement compared to the 'Creation' script you showed us last time?" Zhong Daogong asked the most crucial question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan immediately retracted his arrogant expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Given my status in Da Qi, the highest True Immortal script I could access was indeed "Creation."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However..."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-356" class="calibre1">Chapter 1339: Affairs of Xuanshang in Those Years</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This 'Creation' is not the highest achievement of Da Qi's research on True Immortal scripts," Li Fan said with a look of slight melancholy and sighing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, these words instantly caused the elders of the Immortal Boat to tremble inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They had personally experienced the wonders of "Creation." Even though it was a weakened version that Li Fan had merely recounted, its power was still far superior to single True Immortal scripts like "Bliss."</p>
<p class="calibre2">From this, it could be seen that the true "Creation" script undoubtedly possessed the power to turn decay into magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, Li Fan claimed that the Da Qi civilization had comprehended True Immortal scripts even higher than "Creation"?</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This... Daoist friend, is what you say true?" Even the usually composed Zhong Daogong could no longer maintain his composure and exclaimed aloud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other elders of the Immortal Boat also stared intently at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How could I dare to speak falsely?" Li Fan said seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That script is Da Qi's highest secret, only accessible to those at my master's level. I only overheard him mention it a few times casually while attending to my master."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems... it involves the 'Transformation between Immortals and Mortals.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Transformation between Immortals and Mortals'?" Li Fan's few words caused the expressions of the Immortal Boat elders to vary, and their minds to wander.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan observed their reactions. To enhance the credibility of his words, he added, "This script is indeed extraordinary. Since my master began researching it, in his daily teachings to me, some of the structures of True Immortal scripts I used to write habitually have undergone subtle changes."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But it is precisely these seemingly insignificant changes that have caused the overall True Immortal script to undergo a transformation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">In front of everyone, Li Fan wrote two script structures in the air with swift, flowing strokes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their shapes were identical, but there were subtle differences in radians, turns, and other details.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat stared blankly at these two script structures, lost in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if an infinite magic had completely captivated their attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a full half-day, Zhong Daogong was the first to recover. Without disturbing the other elders' contemplation, he turned his head, avoiding looking at the floating scripts in the air, and tried to replicate them himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he gestured, a look of enlightened joy appeared on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These different script structures were precisely the True Immortal script, related to the "Transformation between Immortals and Mortals," that Li Fan had obtained from the Ghost Tribe's bloodline.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That True Immortal script seemed to contain infinite principles of heaven and earth. Although Li Fan had only glimpsed a corner of it in this life, his strength was insufficient to fully replicate it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The memory of that mysterious script vanished along with the failure of his attempt to perceive it. Only the countless subtle structures that formed the mysterious script remained somewhat imprinted in his memory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan was using these script structures, derived from the "Transformation between Immortals and Mortals," to deceive the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To call it deception was not entirely accurate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The "Transformation between Immortals and Mortals" was of extremely high status.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even a small fragment of it was enough for the elders of the Immortal Boat to benefit immensely!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like at this very moment, the elders who were in a state of enlightenment finally woke up one after another, as if they had been struck by a thunderbolt of enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wrong, wrong! I never thought that our methods from the first half of our lives were all wrong!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It can actually be written like this. Just this subtle modification has increased the efficiency of writing True Immortal scripts by more than ten percent!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not just the efficiency of writing. The True Immortal scripts written using this method seem to have a higher degree of completeness inherently."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders discussed amongst themselves, filled with joy. And Li Fan, in this way, once again proved his value.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the next month, Li Fan officially resided in the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong specially created a new courtyard for Li Fan at the top of the Immortal Boat's Divine Tree, within the Immortal Severing Tower, to demonstrate his high regard for Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Li Fan did not let the people of the Immortal Boat down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Single-handedly, he almost completed the Immortal Boat's rather barren formation system.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With a wise elder leading the way, the Immortal Boat's formation research has leaped forward a hundred years in a single night," exclaimed Meng Xiaomeng, an elder of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He carefully engraved the formation knowledge that Li Fan had imparted onto jade slips.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meng Xiaomeng had always opposed the Immortal Boat betting all its chips on the path of True Immortal scripts. Therefore, in addition to researching True Immortal scripts, he also dabbled in formations and alchemy, attempting to open up other potential paths of survival for the Immortal Boat. However, without the guidance of a renowned master, and relying solely on his own study of the ancient formations recorded in the Immortal Boat, Meng Xiaomeng's formation skills were truly mediocre.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After witnessing Li Fan's formation theories this month, he was immediately astounded. Seeing such a rare opportunity, he dedicated all his energy to studying formations, even setting aside his research on True Immortal scripts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong did not interfere either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, there were too many elders researching True Immortal scripts in the Immortal Boat, and the absence of one Meng Xiaomeng would not make a difference. However, having a new lineage of formation inheritance was quite important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During this period, Li Fan not only established a formation inheritance system for the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under his leadership and assistance, all the defensive formations on the Immortal Boat were rebuilt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the new formations, after being tested by the elders, the Immortal Boat's resistance to attacks increased more than threefold. The defensive capabilities of critical areas like the Immortal Severing Tower, the Immortal Pivot Courtyard, and the Divine Tree were also greatly enhanced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speaking of which, there was also a small interlude during this period.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Initially, the elders of the Immortal Boat had some reservations about rebuilding the formations, especially entrusting such a critical matter concerning the Immortal Boat's safety to Li Fan, a newcomer. The elders had differing opinions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, after witnessing Li Fan dismantle the original defensive array within moments and enter and exit various restricted areas as if they were nothing, the elders of the Immortal Boat were drenched in sweat and quickly reached a unanimous consensus.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Establishing a lineage and building new defenses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With these two accomplishments, Li Fan quickly gained the deep trust of the vast majority of the Immortal Boat members.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, with Li Fan integrating into the Immortal Boat and displaying a gentle and refined demeanor, treating everyone with kindness. He answered any questions posed by those who came to visit him without reservation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon, within the circle of Immortal Boat elders, Li Fan had earned an excellent reputation. Visitors to his courtyard were endless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, Li Fan was teaching the "Tai Jia Divine Technique" to several elders who had come to visit his courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As if my body has become the universe, my will gallops through the galaxies. Tai Jia has no limits, spirit roams; Tai Jia has no change, spirit transforms; Tai Jia has no void, spirit transcends..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders were all captivated by the True Immortal scripts and were initially not very interested in this so-called divine ability. However, after listening to the complete rendition of this divine ability, they all became solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Li, this divine ability seems to be only a fragment?" Elder Lu Yuzhi asked with a frown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had been mingling with the Immortal Boat for a while and had gained everyone's goodwill. Their appellations had also become more familiar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although it is a fragment, it does not hinder communication with the Star Sea's consciousness. However, even for the Star Sea's consciousness, which is close to destruction, it is not easy for us cultivators to contact it. Whether we succeed or not depends on each of your own fortunes."</p>
<p class="calibre2">After finishing the explanation of the Tai Jia Divine Technique, Li Fan looked at everyone and said with a smile, "The communication with the Star Sea can be like the ancient state of 'unity of heaven and humanity.' Whether it's enlightenment or deduction efficiency, it cannot be compared to normal circumstances."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It even greatly benefits our comprehension of True Immortal scripts. Heh, those old fellows who didn't come today will surely regret it when they find out! We must keep our mouths shut and never reveal it unless they pay a hefty price," Gan Jingda said jovially, having understood the mysteries of the Tai Jia Divine Technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Li's knowledge is truly terrifyingly profound. It's like an endless treasure trove; every time I come, I gain new insights," Elder Nangong Lie's words caused everyone present to nod in admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing everyone's praise, Li Fan responded calmly: "My lifelong wish is to pour out all the knowledge in my mind before I perish, leaving it to the Immortal Boat."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And then, in the final moments of my life, I will risk everything to see the scenery beyond the high wall!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan spoke with an air of freedom and indifference.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among the elders in the room, some felt regret, some felt heartache, and some were unable to bear it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Li, is there really no other way?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat's treasury seems to contain some longevity elixirs. Why not..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan waved his hand dismissively: "After the defensive formations were rebuilt, Elder Zhong took me to try the secret treasury. My lifespan has indeed reached its limit, and no heavenly materials or earthly treasures can help. I have long accepted my fate."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can only say that the backlash from beyond the high wall is indeed terrifying."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it has only fueled my curiosity even more. My entire life, I must see what lies beyond the high wall!" Li Fan's gaze was resolute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The people of the Immortal Boat fell silent, sighing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, Li Fan seemed to remember something: "Oh, right. When I suffered the backlash before, my master told me that if it weren't for the puppet I acquired from the Immortal Boat's treasury to resist some of the force, I likely wouldn't have even twenty years left, but would have perished directly."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is the origin of that puppet? When I chose it, I only thought its appearance was very peculiar. I didn't expect it to have the ability to resist the power from beyond the high wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Li Fan spoke, he displayed an image of the puppet, standing with its hands down, its eyebrows lowered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Li Fan chose the puppet in the treasury, they had all accompanied him. Li Fan's words made them recall the scene, and their expressions became strange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This puppet actually has such a miraculous use?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">They looked at each other, but none of them knew its origin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Wait, I'll go check." Lu Yuzhi stood up, his expression serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, it was a relic capable of resisting the backlash from beyond the high wall, and they couldn't afford to treat it lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Li, why didn't you ask about such an important matter earlier?" Nangong Lie shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan smiled: "At that moment, I heard that my lifespan was nearing its end and my bright future was shattered. I was mentally distraught and couldn't care about so many things. However, now that I've calmed down, and having just mentioned the Immortal Boat's treasury, I remembered it again."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's explanation made the elders of the Immortal Boat unwilling to press the matter further.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi returned in a hurry not long after.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to the records, this puppet originates from the destroyed cultivation world, [Carefree]." Lu Yuzhi waved his hand, displaying an image to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this familiar name, Li Fan's heart stirred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The cultivators of this world disliked conflict. As their name suggests, they were naturally unrestrained and carefree, unwilling to be bound by anything. This puppet was bought from a gambler by the Xuan Shang Immortal Boat when they passed through the Carefree Realm back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The image shifted, and a disheveled, shabby man appeared before everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The era was too ancient, and the reconstruction of the image was unstable, with frequent jumps. The sound was also intermittent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it did not prevent everyone from understanding the events of that time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This thing is a genuine treasure. You gaining possession of it is definitely not a loss!" the shabby man said brazenly, rubbing his crotch and then sniffing his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This puppet, it seems indeed extraordinary. But your asking price of 100,000 high-grade spirit stones is too high. It exceeds my authority." Outside the picture, a crisp voice sounded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This was a merchant in the Carefree Realm back then, named..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Jia Chu. Yes, Jia Chu. It was he who completed this transaction and strictly followed the regulations of the Immortal Boat, recording the entire process and archiving it. That's why we are fortunate enough to see the scene from ten thousand years ago." Lu Yuzhi introduced to Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's a pity that this Jia Chu, during the split of the Immortal Boat that year, chose to side with the Shang Immortal Boat. I don't know where he is now." Lu Yuzhi said with some regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded slightly and continued watching the unfolding scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jia Chu got up as if to leave, without any sign of reluctance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the shabby man, who had been nonchalant before, suddenly became anxious. He grabbed Jia Chu and said with a fawning smile, "If the price is too high, we can still negotiate. Eighty thousand, just eighty thousand will do! For a renowned sect like your Xuan Shang Immortal Boat, eighty thousand high-grade spirit stones is merely a drop in the ocean!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jia Chu was indifferent to the shabby man's tightly clasped hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He said unhurriedly, "Although our Xuan Shang Immortal Boat is a large sect, we cannot spend eighty thousand spirit stones on a puppet of unknown origin."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thirty thousand spirit stones is the limit I can decide. Anything more would require reporting, which is too troublesome. It's better not to make this transaction," Jia Chu's tone was decisive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thirty thousand? You're squeezing me too hard," the shabby man grumbled, very displeased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If you think the price is too low, you can go to the native merchant guilds in the Carefree Realm to sell it," Jia Chu said indifferently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The shabby man scratched his head and did not reply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The native merchant guilds in the Carefree Realm are actually inextricably linked with our Xuan Shang Immortal Boat. It's not an exaggeration to say they are our branches in the Carefree Realm. This shabby cultivator knows this, which is why he stopped talking sullenly." Lu Yuzhi explained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, after another round of bargaining, Jia Chu finally purchased the puppet for forty-five thousand spirit stones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before handing over the spirit stones, Jia Chu suddenly asked, "Where did you obtain this puppet?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">The shabby man's expression immediately became alert.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jia Chu faintly pointed to the recording light ball beside him: "It's just a routine inquiry. You don't have to say if you don't want to."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, if there are any problems with this puppet later on, we will still find you."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-357" class="calibre1">Chapter 1340: Misty Starry Sky Journey</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuan Shang Immortal Boat's fleet travels across the Star Sea. If we truly want to find someone, even if they flee to the desolate lands at the edge of the Star Sea, they cannot escape," Jia Chu said in a calm tone, exuding a subtle aura of dominance and confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the Xuan Immortal Boat elders like Lu Yuzhi, ten thousand years later, couldn't help but straighten their backs and show a proud look upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The shabby man in the image, upon hearing this, trembled slightly and quickly waved his hands: "No, no, no. Let's explain all these troublesome matters together. I, this person, fear trouble!" Saying this, the shabby man took out a cucumber from nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While recalling, he bit into it with relish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This thing was given to me by someone I saved out of kindness back then, as a token of gratitude for saving his life. He said it could 'Guard against disaster and misfortune.'"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I don't know the exact meaning, but I guessed that perhaps it could block disasters for its owner in critical moments, so I happily accepted it." The shabby man paused while speaking, wiping the juice from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's what I thought. However, a while ago, I was almost beaten to death by those debt collectors, and this thing didn't do anything at all..." The man burped, speaking with a look of misfortune.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jia Chu chuckled upon hearing this: "It's useless, yet you sold it to our Xuan Shang Immortal Boat?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not that it's useless, it's just that it's not for saving lives," the shabby man corrected Jia Chu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although this puppet is useless to me, your Immortal Boat travels the Star Sea, and you will always encounter cultivators who need it. Then, if you tenfold the price and resell it, you'll definitely make a fortune. Besides, with your Immortal Boat's connections, even if you're unlucky and can't find a buyer, you'll still run into one or two fools, right? You won't be stuck with it..." the shabby man tried his best to persuade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And looking at Jia Chu's expression, he didn't seem to care much about the profit or loss of this transaction from beginning to end, and had already decided to buy the puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi sighed with some emotion: "Jia Chu's way of doing things is truly that of a standard Immortal Boat merchant. For the ancient Xuan Shang Immortal Boat that traversed the Star Sea, spirit stones were just numbers. Even short-term profits and losses were not that important..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What's truly important is the abundance of the Immortal Boat's secret collection, and the increase in bargaining chips against True Immortals," Zhong Daogong's voice suddenly came from outside the small building.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before his voice had finished, he had already appeared inside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Elder Zhong." Everyone bowed in greeting. Zhong Daogong returned the bow, but his gaze fell on the scene in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of Zhong Daogong's arrival, the recording of the scene was temporarily paused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"You're actually free to come over?" Li Fan asked with a smile. Zhong Daogong, as the chief of the Immortal Severing Tower, managed all the major and minor affairs of the Immortal Boat, and naturally didn't have as much free time as other elders to visit Li Fan's courtyard frequently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just now, while Yu Zhi was reviewing the documents, I also discovered some interesting things. Let's continue watching..." The recorded image continued to play.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the end of the transaction, besides the agreed-upon forty-five thousand spirit stones, Jia Chu also gave the shabby man an additional five thousand spirit stones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Jia, what's the meaning of this?" While asking this verbally, the man didn't hesitate to quickly pocket the five thousand spirit stones, lest the other party go back on his word.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jia Chu smiled peacefully: "It's just incidentally inquiring about the information of the injured person you saved back then. If this puppet can truly be sold at a high price in the future, we might continue to acquire it. Let's keep the contact information for future reference." The shabby man, having received the spirit stones, was very amenable: "It's just this? Then no problem!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I remember, what was that person's name. Oh, right, Sun Piaomiao! He's not a native cultivator of our Carefree Realm, but a cultivator from [Xuanhuang]. He came by traversing the Star Sea. Just as he was about to arrive, he encountered a Star Sea anomaly called [Heavenly Whale Breaching the Surface], and although he narrowly escaped death, he was heavily injured and fell from the sky."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I hadn't been moved by a sudden impulse of kindness and taken good care of him, he would definitely not have survived in his condition back then," the shabby man said proudly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Xuanhuang Realm, Sun Piaomiao..." The image ended with Jia Chu's whisper. The name Sun Piaomiao caused a stir among the elders of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This name sounds familiar. I seem to have heard it somewhere?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sun Piaomiao, Sun Piaomiao..." In fact, the moment Li Fan heard the name, his heart also trembled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Sun Piaomiao was the ancestor of the Medicine King Sect in the Xuanhuang Realm. Sun Piaomiao had once traveled across myriad realms, leaving behind a travelogue and recording information on eighteen other cultivation worlds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among them were Carefree and Xuan Shang. Li Fan looked at Zhong Daogong, who had suddenly appeared, and asked, "The interesting thing you mentioned, is it this Sun Piaomiao?" Zhong Daogong nodded and gently waved his hand, and phantom images of three items instantly appeared before everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to the records left by the Immortal Boat, ten years after the puppet transaction, Sun Piaomiao visited the Xuan Shang Immortal Boat and, together with the Immortal Boat, pursued the Star Sea anomaly [Meteorite Hail]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Meteorite Hail was one of the extremely rare anomalies in the Star Sea at that time. Countless giant crystal-like meteorites roared forward like a torrential rain from the darkness. They shattered all obstacles in their path. The collision created dazzling sparks and ice mist, sweeping out a terrifying storm of intertwined cold and heat along its path. Even being brushed by the edge of this storm was a world-ending disaster for a cultivation world," Zhong Daogong briefly explained the Star Sea anomaly of Meteorite Hail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although Meteorite Hail was extremely dangerous, in the core of countless ice meteor swarms, a peculiar substance called [Abyssal Ice Dust] was often born. It is said that just a single speck of this substance could freeze an entire ordinary-sized cultivation world. And the power unleashed when the ice bursts had the might to almost cleave the heavens and earth."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So, were they successful in their pursuit?" Li Fan asked, engrossed in listening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There is no record in the Profound Immortal Boat. However, from my guess, they must have successfully found some [Abyssal Ice Dust]. Sun Piaomiao took some, and left behind three items as bargaining chips. As for the rest, it was probably taken by the Shang Immortal Boat later," Zhong Daogong's tone was full of regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded, not surprised. After all, the Shang Immortal Boat, as the de facto victor back then, had taken almost all the near-immortal powers from the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Zhong Daogong's description, the explosive power of Abyssal Ice Dust was no less than that of a True Immortal, so it was normal for it to be chosen by the Shang Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The key was these three items left by Sun Piaomiao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I don't recall seeing these items in the Hundred Wonders Immortal Record secret treasure before? Could they have also gone to the Shang Immortal Boat?" Li Fan asked with a frown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong smiled: "Not at all. These three items are still in our Profound Immortal Boat's collection. However, what you visited earlier was only the outer layer of the secret treasure. These items should be in the second layer." Li Fan did not get angry, but instead teased: "It sounds like there's a third and fourth layer."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The deepest part is the third layer. You also know about the theft by outsiders back then, but these are just necessary preventive measures," Zhong Daogong said calmly, without the slightest embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not dwell on the matter any further, his gaze falling on the three relics left by Sun Piaomiao. Their style was very similar to that of the dangling puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One was a gray bird with a broken wing, its wings broken, yet it still tilted its head and chirped. The second was a three-branched tree, with its branches ending not in leaves, but in countless miniature trees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the third item, it was something Li Fan was very familiar with. It was a small cauldron, which, judging by its appearance, looked almost identical to the Medicine King Cauldron of the Medicine King Sect!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sun Piaomiao doesn't seem like an unparalleled powerhouse. Yet, the items he gifted actually contain the power to resist the high wall..." Li Fan's tone was enigmatic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong said solemnly: "Sun Piaomiao lived in an era when the immortal path was not severed. There are even records of True Immortals descending to the mortal world. Although based on the records of Sun Piaomiao's activities with the Immortal Boat back then, his strength was only at the peak of Dao Integration, it cannot be ruled out that he concealed his strength." Li Fan nodded slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He did not reveal his own speculation. Sun Piaomiao's ability to traverse the Star Sea alone and return safely was undoubtedly due to his formidable strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he certainly did not ascend to immortality. In the long ancient history of the cultivation world, the records of Xuanhuang cultivators ascending to immortality had all been inexplicably erased, and no trace could be found.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is what is meant by True Immortals having no name. Perhaps only those like Mo Rubin, who experienced the transition between the old and new eras, could remember the matter of Grand Master Miaofa of the Nine Refinements Sect ascending and perishing through oral tradition.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Firstly, the descendants of the Medicine King Sect never mentioned the ascension of their ancestor Sun Piaomiao to immortality. Even Sun Piaomiao's final fate was unclear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he live out his natural lifespan, die accidentally, or disappear inexplicably? The records of Sun Piaomiao only lasted until his return from traversing the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, there was no further information. Secondly, Sun Piaomiao was not only recorded in the Medicine King Sect's records.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many scriptures in the Xuanhuang Realm mentioned him, this peerless powerhouse who pioneered the Medicine King lineage with his benevolent healing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His existence was not erased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When Sun Piaomiao traversed the Star Sea back then, he intended to travel further, but he discovered the special nature of the star field where the Xuanhuang Realm was located and eventually returned..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Was it unwillingness, or inability?" Just as Li Fan was deep in thought, Zhong Daogong spoke again: "Sun Piaomiao left behind these three items, similar to the dangling puppet you chose earlier. Although the Immortal Boat has carefully examined them, no specific features have been found. However, since they all originated from this Sun Piaomiao, perhaps they hide some secrets..." Li Fan did not reply. The other elders were becoming restless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then hurry up and check!" Li Fan said indifferently to Zhong Daogong. Zhong Daogong smiled slightly: "With your contributions during this period, I believe no elder will object to you entering the second layer of the Hundred Wonders Immortal Record secret treasure." Not long after, Li Fan followed the elders into the second layer of the Hundred Wonders Immortal Record secret treasure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the first layer, this space was significantly smaller. All the treasures were sealed within orbs of light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The orbs were of various colors, floating in the air. The protective measures were not formations, nor restrictions, nor True Immortal scripts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan squinted at the myriad orbs of light, faintly sensing a breath of life from them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"These orbs... are alive?" Zhong Daogong nodded and praised: "Your intuition is truly sharp!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's right. The guardians of the second layer of the treasure vault are a miraculous life form: the Celestial Star Light Lotus. This life form was extremely rare even when the Star Sea flourished in the past. Its dreamlike radiance enveloped half the Star Domain, weaving into the shape of a dreamlike lotus. When the flower bloomed, the Star Domain was bathed in brilliant light; when the flower fell, the Star Domain plunged into silent darkness."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Every time a world in the Star Domain is destroyed, lotus seeds are formed within the light lotus. For billions of years, this cycle has repeated... The light clusters before you were formed in this way." As Li Fan listened to Zhong Daogong's explanation, the magnificent scene of the ancient Star Sea seemed to appear before his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Shang Immortal Boat took away many treasures back then. This Celestial Star Light Lotus is one of the most valuable remnants."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Treasures are sealed within the lotus seeds and cannot be easily removed. If you want to forcibly take them..." Zhong Daogong snorted coldly: "Unless the entire Celestial Star Light Lotus is destroyed! This spiritual creature resides within the Star Sea. Having survived countless calamities, its life still persists. Destroying it would require immortal power!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, we have tested, and even the power of True Immortal scripts cannot damage it in a short time." The elders of the Immortal Boat were clearly very confident in the protection of this Celestial Star Light Lotus.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, a thought flashed through Li Fan's mind: "In my previous life, under the Myriad Things Return to Void Great Array, this Celestial Star Light Lotus didn't last long either."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now, I don't even need to use immortal formations; the Descending Dust Finger can destroy it. However, destroying it is easy, but extracting the contents within the lotus seeds is indeed somewhat difficult." The elders of the Immortal Boat naturally did not know Li Fan's dangerous thoughts. Unitedly, they carefully opened the orb containing Sun Piaomiao's three relics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their gazes converged on the three treasures. Li Fan's heart stirred; he sensed a similar "Returning to True" anomaly from the three-branched tree as he had from the dangling puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he did not voice it, and together with the elders of the Immortal Boat, he observed carefully. The broken-winged gray bird and the second Medicine King Cauldron seemed to contain no special power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Guard against disaster and misfortune... approximates a projection of the Dao. Sun Piaomiao is indeed not simple."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And this ability was not passed down to the Medicine King Sect." Li Fan's eyes flickered, suppressing the impulse to "Returning to True" absorption.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Elders, have you discovered anything?" Zhong Daogong asked after observing for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can't see anything strange, but indeed, these items give me a very peculiar feeling." Lu Yuzhi's statement was echoed by the other elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they hadn't known about the abnormality of these three items, they wouldn't have found anything wrong upon first glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if they observed them after knowing, then various inconsistencies would arise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If only one or two people felt this way, it could be explained as an illusion. But with more than ten elders present feeling the same way... then it was definitely not just an illusion.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-358" class="calibre1">Chapter 1341: The Reason for World Destruction Back Then</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A superior method of concealment. Only those who deliberately search for these items and know that they might hide secrets will notice their abnormality. While in the eyes of others..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They are merely ordinary objects." Everyone present vaguely understood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If not for Brother Li's chance encounter, who saw through the secret of the puppet, even after a thousand years, our Immortal Boat might not have discovered the peculiarity of these items," Lu Yuzhi exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The problem now is that we know they are strange, but we cannot find a way to decipher their secrets."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heh heh, don't worry. If we can comprehend True Immortal scripts, can't we deal with these things? Could it be that Sun Piaomiao is even stronger than True Immortals?" The elders of the Immortal Boat were very confident in themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And their talent was indeed not to be underestimated. After observing continuously for seven days, someone actually discovered the anomaly in Sun Piaomiao's relics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Everyone, please look at this small cauldron," said Mo Yinfeng of the Immortal Severing Tower, who was usually silent and focused solely on his research.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Previously, the Immortal Boat's multiple inspections and identifications concluded that it was a high-grade alchemy treasure, even equipped with a Grotto-Heaven space that could generate spiritual energy and cultivate spiritual plants and crops on its own. But..." Mo Yinfeng said, then cast a 【Reveal】 script, engulfing the Medicine King Cauldron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if falling into a hazy mist, tangible lines, thick and thin, emerged from the mist surrounding the Medicine King Cauldron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They tore through space and flew in different directions, disappearing from everyone's observation within moments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This... the Medicine King Cauldron is not unique? It's still connected to beings in the Star Sea?!" The other elders of the Immortal Boat were all shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan also narrowed his eyes. Because among everyone present, only he realized that one of the lines from the Medicine King Cauldron's mist was heading towards the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the others...</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Most of them are heading towards the Remnant Realm Great Wall. But there are still two or three going to a certain place in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea!" The elders discussed amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Zhong Elder's interpretation of the Tai Jia picture seems more logical."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"True Immortals play chess, and the worlds descend like pieces."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If that's the case, what was the purpose of setting up this game? And who is the final winner?" This led to even greater doubts in everyone's minds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's not delve too deep into matters involving True Immortals for now. What we know now is that this gray chess piece is likely an artifact formed by a True Immortal who refined a world. Even without the augmentation of immortal spiritual power, it can be considered half an immortal artifact."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And it's a complete set. Those gray chess pieces that have lost their eligibility to compete are already so miraculous. It's hard to imagine what the final black and white twin worlds on the chessboard would be like!" Lu Yuzhi said with yearning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Heh heh, don't forget, the Immortal Realm has long since been destroyed. Even the chess player might have perished, let alone those on the chessboard. They have likely disappeared along with the Immortal Realm. On the contrary, these gray chess pieces that left the game earlier have coincidentally survived in the form of artifacts." ... The elders of the Immortal Boat discussed spiritedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, after half a day of discussion, they reached a preliminary consensus. Since the essence is a world, they would refine it using methods for dealing with worlds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders nominated Jian Dao Sheng, Zhong Daogong, and four other elders from the Dao Proving Academy, a total of five people, to merge their minds and refine it together. Li Fan was not included among them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To avoid causing Li Fan any displeasure, the elders of the Immortal Boat specifically explained. Although Li Fan had earned the trust of the elders, he had only joined the Immortal Boat a short time ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The most important reason was his "approaching end of lifespan." If he were to participate now, he would perish within twenty years. After his death, it would be necessary to re-sacrifice it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wait. ... Li Fan waved his hand, feigning indifference. He stared intently at the gray chess piece being refined by everyone in the center of the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This item is Sun Piaomiao's hidden contingency. If there are any abnormalities during the refining process, it would mean that Sun Piaomiao is still alive in this world..." Li Fan mused inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he was disappointed. The refining process by the elders of the Immortal Boat was surprisingly smooth. Soon, after being refined, the gray color of the chess piece seemed to fade slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But ultimately, the gray color did not completely disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Did Sun Piaomiao truly perish?" A doubt flashed through Li Fan's mind. He suppressed it for now and asked Zhong Daogong and the others about their feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Marvelous. The orderly world heavenly law seems to have been tempered by a heavy hammer and reforged. Such a technique is truly divine!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not just forging a form. It has even forged hundreds of possible futures. After refining it, we can manipulate it and transform it at will among these forms..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Uh, this transformation likely requires a large amount of energy. Spiritual energy is not enough to support it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I tried, and even the power of True Immortal scripts is insufficient," Nangong Lie's tone was filled with regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if they had obtained a novel treasure, the elders of the Immortal Boat rejoiced and refined the gray chess piece, transforming it into a form most suitable for the current Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bang! Bang!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bang! Like phantom heavy hammers striking the gray chess piece. This originally small object gradually expanded in its spatial structure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It directly covered the outer shell of the Immortal Boat. Under Li Fan's gaze, the Immortal Boat seemed to have grown a layer of gray, hard keratin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This layer of keratin not only provided protection but also continuously supplied spiritual energy and resources to the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With the protective shell of a world, our Immortal Boat's defensive capability has increased by more than double. The stability has also been qualitatively improved."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We no longer need to worry about even a single True Immortal script's original power spreading causing a devastating blow to the Immortal Boat!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The vitality accumulated in the gray chess piece over ten thousand years has now been transferred to the Divine Tree."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The effect is very significant! At the very least, for the next hundred years, without special circumstances, the Divine Tree will no longer need to absorb food..." ... The elders of the Immortal Boat were all overjoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, Li Fan suddenly said coldly: "Elders, with such a great harvest this time, are you not going to give up on your plan to cross the high wall?" The lively scene instantly turned cold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders instinctively avoided Li Fan's gaze. Finally, Zhong Daogong stepped forward to appease him: "You don't need to worry."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Crossing the high wall is a strategy we decided on long ago and will not change due to material abundance. You can rest assured of this."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The more preparations, the better. Based on the mutual sensing between these gray chess pieces, there are at least eleven other identical existences in the Utmost Darkness Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even just one of them has brought about earth-shattering changes to our Immortal Boat. If we gather the complete set of chess pieces..." Zhong Daogong's gaze was sharp.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What do you think, Daoist friend? At that time, we might not even need other assistance; just the layered outer defenses alone could directly break through the high wall!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, the directions indicated by the sensing are clear. Even if we were to traverse the entire Star Sea at our speed, it would take no more than three years. At the same time, we will not neglect our other preparations during the journey..." Zhong Daogong provided a reasonable explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pondered for a moment, then nodded slightly, having implicitly agreed. The previously awkward atmosphere then returned to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In that case, let's not delay any longer. Let's set off immediately."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am also very curious about what will happen after collecting this set of gray chess pieces," Li Fan said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders looked at each other, then held a simple discussion meeting. They first reached a consensus: "The Profound Immortal Boat definitely cannot be moved easily."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, with the current strength of the hull, it is not enough to withstand the pressure below the high wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Collecting the gray chess pieces does not require all of us to move. It would be a burden. It would be much more convenient for us to go alone."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Using sensing to command from afar and guide the direction. Others can disperse to various parts of the Star Sea to collect the gray chess pieces."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This should be more efficient."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At least three people per group, to prevent accidents."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are seven or eight of them not far from our current location, seemingly near the Remnant Realm Great Wall. Let's collect those first." ... While the elders were discussing, Li Fan also said in a deep voice: "I can also contribute my humble efforts. With the amplification of my escape technique, even traversing the Star Sea would only take a day's time." This time, the elders of the Immortal Boat had no reason to refuse Li Fan's proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The preliminary consensus reached was that the first task of retrieving the gray chess pieces would be undertaken by Li Fan, Nangong Lie, Lu Yuzhi, and four elders from the Dao Proving Academy named Xu Gongding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"First, investigate the situation. If you encounter any danger, prioritize your own safety," Zhong Daogong instructed before their departure.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-359" class="calibre1">Chapter 1342: The True Immortal Sets Up the Game</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"This [Myriad Manifestations Yin-Yang Diagram], its usage is simple. It's like a mirror that can reveal the essence of things on the blank scroll. Of course, it might not be so direct. Perhaps it requires further contemplation..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But no matter what, it's much easier than directly studying this gray chess piece," Zhong Daogong said, his lips moving as he slowly unrolled the blank scroll.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a long dragon, it floated above everyone's heads.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Go!" The gray chess piece slowly flew towards the Myriad Manifestations Yin-Yang Diagram. The moment it approached, it vanished from everyone's sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And on the blank scroll, as if drops of paint had fallen, bizarre and strange scenes began to appear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was like a storm of paint merging, different colors interweaving, colliding, and separating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It can analyze objects from the Immortal Realm. Could this Myriad Manifestations Diagram also be from the Immortal Realm?" Li Fan asked casually, watching the constantly changing images on the scroll.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No, no. This Myriad Manifestations Diagram is undoubtedly an artifact from the lower realms." Jian Dao Sheng smiled and answered Li Fan's question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This diagram was acquired by the Xuan Shang Immortal Boat from a fallen cultivator."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This cultivator's ancestor was a disciple of the renowned [Star Dao Sect] in the Star Sea. In ancient times, the Star Dao Sect's influence spanned several neighboring cultivation worlds. Their sect's profound techniques were said to be able to control the Dao of the Star Sea, surpassing even the Tai Jia Divine Technique you taught us." Li Fan raised his eyebrows: "How did such a magnificent sect decline?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That remains an eternal mystery. Not to mention now, even back then, there were various theories, and no accurate answer. Some say they offended True Immortals from the upper realms, and the upper realms sent immortal punishment. Others say the Star Dao Sect attempted to refine and control the Heavenly Dao of the Star Sea, and were ultimately backlashed by the Star Sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In short, for some unknown reason, the high-ranking officials and pillars of the Star Dao Sect seemed to have disappeared overnight. The remaining lower-level disciples, who were unaware of what had happened, waited for a short while, and realizing that the situation was irrecoverable, scattered like birds startled from a bush. Before leaving, they didn't forget to loot all the movable objects from the sect."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Within just a month, this once renowned great sect in the Star Sea collapsed." Jian Dao Sheng sighed with emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Myriad Manifestations Yin-Yang Diagram was a treasure of the Star Dao Sect back then. It is said that in the Star Dao Sect's Star Communication Hall, where Star Dao cultivators connected with and perceived the Heavenly Dao of the Star Sea, such Myriad Manifestations Yin-Yang Diagrams were hung everywhere."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Every time the Heavenly Dao of the Star Sea communicated with cultivators, it was like an invisible ink brush leaving traces on the scroll. Over time, these scrolls thus depicted the Heavenly Dao of the Star Sea within them." ... Hearing this, Li Fan couldn't help but interrupt: "Even if it's a depiction of the Heavenly Dao of the Star Sea, how could it manifest objects from the upper realms?" Although he pretended to be ignorant with his question, Li Fan actually had the answer in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong smiled: "The Star Sea, the lower realms, are the foundation of all things."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The projection of the Great Dao ultimately manifests here. Even if the Immortal Realm is high above, it is not an illusion. From bottom to top, although we cannot see its true form, we can still glimpse the shadow of the Dao." Li Fan, hearing this, seemed to be encountering this theory for the first time, his mind appearing greatly shaken, falling into deep thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The evolution of the Myriad Manifestations Yin-Yang Diagram continued. Like an invisible True Immortal, wielding a brush and flying dragon, splashing ink and painting a vigorous script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, the color storm settled into a picture, and calm returned. Li Fan looked at the painting above their heads, his pupils contracting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not a realistic style with detailed descriptions, but rather an abstract, rough sketch presenting the outlines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A towering figure occupied nearly half the frame, looking down from above. Its face was indistinct, and it extended long arms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Below the figure, there seemed to be a chessboard. What was placed on the chessboard were not gray chess pieces, but individual cultivation worlds, each vastly different from the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those seemed to be just clusters of merged colors, and upon attempting to probe them, countless scenes of different beings actually appeared in their minds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were born, aged, died, cultivated, and warred within their worlds. The stories of these beings, along with the cultivation world itself, formed a chess piece on the board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom... After displaying before everyone for a few breaths, this Myriad Manifestations Yin-Yang Diagram suddenly, as if blown by a strong wind, not only did the scroll itself shake violently, but</p>
<p class="calibre2">even the pigments on the canvas were swept away by the storm. The picture gradually disintegrated. The gray chess pieces also slowly retreated from the painting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The decomposition of the Myriad Manifestations Diagram has reached its limit." Zhong Daogong said in a deep voice, and together with the other elders, solemnly put away the Yin-Yang Myriad Manifestations Diagram.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, they looked at the gray chess piece quietly floating in the air, falling into an eerie silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my understanding is correct, this gray chess piece seems to be a cultivation world after the extinction of its life and the withering of all things? And that towering figure should be a True Immortal from the upper realms?" It was Li Fan who spoke first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No one responded. After a while, Jian Dao Sheng shook his head and offered his opinion: "Although the analysis of the Myriad Manifestations Diagram points directly to the essence of the matter, it would not be so superficial."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Medicine King Cauldron, almost self-contained, can generate spiritual energy and cultivate herbs and spiritual plants on its own..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How could a world devoid of life achieve that?" Zhong Daogong agreed: "Precisely. I believe that what is depicted, or rather, the world that acts as a chess piece, does not represent death. But rather, it means it has lost its role on the chessboard and has completed its mission, becoming a discarded piece." Saying this, intersecting horizontal and vertical lines appeared, and black and white chess pieces were successively placed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then the black pieces surrounded and ate the white pieces. These eaten white pieces left the chessboard and had no chance to return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They transformed into gray, no longer participating in the contest between black and white pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Elder Zhong's interpretation seems more logical." Among the elders of the Immortal Boat, their communication was less about scheming and more about speaking frankly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's interpretation of the Myriad Manifestations Diagram's image gained the approval of the vast majority of the elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"True Immortals play chess, and the worlds descend like pieces."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If that's the case, what was the purpose of setting up this game? And who is the final winner?" This led to even greater doubts in everyone's minds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's not delve too deep into matters involving True Immortals for now.

<p class="calibre2">Wait. ... Li Fan waved his hand, feigning indifference. He stared intently at the gray chess piece being refined by everyone in the center of the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This item is Sun Piaomiao's hidden contingency. If there are any abnormalities during the refining process, it would mean that Sun Piaomiao is still alive in this world..." Li Fan mused inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he was disappointed. The refining process by the elders of the Immortal Boat was surprisingly smooth. Soon, after being refined, the gray color of the chess piece seemed to fade slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But ultimately, the gray color did not completely disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Did Sun Piaomiao truly perish?" A doubt flashed through Li Fan's mind. He suppressed it for now and asked Zhong Daogong and the others about their feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Marvelous. The orderly world heavenly law seems to have been tempered by a heavy hammer and reforged. Such a technique is truly divine!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not just forging a form. It has even forged hundreds of possible futures. After refining it, we can manipulate it and transform it at will among these forms..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Uh, this transformation likely requires a large amount of energy. Spiritual energy is not enough to support it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I tried, and even the power of True Immortal scripts is insufficient," Nangong Lie's tone was filled with regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if they had obtained a novel treasure, the elders of the Immortal Boat rejoiced and refined the gray chess piece, transforming it into a form most suitable for the current Immortal Boat.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-360" class="calibre1">Chapter 1343: Forging Immortal Realm Fragments</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Great Wall of Remaining Realms. Li Fan urged his wooden sword phantom, carrying the three Immortal Boat elders including Nangong Lie, and moved slowly within it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Brother Li's escape technique is truly heaven-defying. Not only is it incredibly fast, but it also mitigates the effects of the reverberating Star Power. With this protection, our search for the gray chess pieces should be much smoother," Nangong Lie lamented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi also chimed in, "Indeed. Otherwise, just resisting this terrifying suction would consume the majority of our strength." Xu Gongding remained silent, surveying the void outside, diligently searching for traces of the gray chess pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As they belonged to the same set of artifacts, their senses could not pinpoint exact locations. They only vaguely indicated a general vicinity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the Great Wall of Remaining Realms, countless world fragments were scattered. And the gray chess pieces, in the form of artifacts, were hidden within these world fragments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To find the target among them was like searching for a needle in a haystack. Especially since their divine senses were also affected here, making the exploration process even more arduous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan now personally experienced it and finally understood the difficulty faced by the Heavenly Physician. It took thousands of years to collect fragments of the Heavenly Law Realm and it was still not completed, which was understandable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, the mysterious power used by the gray chess pieces for concealment was very peculiar. Knowing that there were hidden secrets within, one could detect their abnormality at a glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no need to worry about missing them during the search. The luck of the four was indeed quite good, finding the first lost chess piece only three days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It lay quietly on the ruins of the earth, a rusty bronze war chariot. Five divine and handsome warhorses stood proudly in front of the chariot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surface of the chariot was covered with sword and knife carvings, showing signs of weathering. Instead of transforming the chariot back to its original form in the void, the four first collected and preserved it, to be handled by the Immortal Boat Elder Council after returning to the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the success of the first attempt, the few were greatly encouraged. Over the next ten days, the wooden sword phantom continuously shuttled through the Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also found three more disguised chess pieces. These were a broken sword, a seemingly ordinary wine gourd, and a small wooden boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can't go on. I need to rest a bit," just as they were about to press on, Li Fan suddenly turned pale and said weakly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi realized, "We were careless. Such a heaven-defying divine ability must consume a great deal. Brother Li has been using it continuously these past few days, it's no wonder you've reached your limit..." Nangong Lie asked with concern, "How long does Brother Li need to rest? Without your escape technique's augmentation, our search efficiency will be too slow relying on just us!" Li Fan said solemnly, guaranteeing, "Don't worry, I'll recover in three days. The depletion of spiritual energy is secondary; it's mainly the immense drain on my mind." Lu Yuzhi first praised Li Fan greatly, then took the opportunity to inquire about the principle behind this escape technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat had long coveted Li Fan's miraculous wooden sword phantom flight technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan, who was always generous in sharing his knowledge, was extremely tight-lipped about this wooden sword divine ability. He refused to reveal any details.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders of the Immortal Boat had not given up, trying to inquire whenever they had the chance. And this time, Li Fan's secrecy attitude actually showed a slight loosening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"My escape technique is condensed from two supreme Dao intents. The first is the sword. The momentum of moving forward relentlessly, brave and forward-moving."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for the second..." Li Fan paused, whetting the curiosity of the three. Then, he unhurriedly continued, "It is [The ends of the earth are within a咫尺]! The ends of the earth and the corners of the sea are but a咫尺 apart. Crossing the Star Sea is indeed infinitely long, but if it's just a咫尺, then one step is enough!" Next, he explained the details of these two supreme true intents to the three elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three elders listened attentively, nodding repeatedly, lost in deep thought. Li Fan, meanwhile, revealed an inexplicable smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the process of teaching, he did not twist or falsify. With the knowledge of the Immortal Boat elders, any fabrication would be easily seen through.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had merely hidden the most crucial part: that the core of the escape technique divine ability was the [Transformation of True and False].</p>
<p class="calibre2">What sword Dao, what "The ends of the earth are within a咫尺." Without the core blessing of the True and False Transformation, it was impossible to achieve what Li Fan could, directly ignoring the various crises and True Immortal residual powers permeating the Star Sea during flight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did this precisely to use this intentionally "leaked" divine ability to interfere with the minds of the three Immortal Boat elders. And Li Fan's objective, naturally, was the four gray chess pieces that had been found.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps due to psychological trauma from the past transmission of techniques, even though the four who went out to search for chess pieces this time were theoretically impossible to betray the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat still formulated the rule of four people jointly guarding them. The four each controlled a fragment of the round ball. The four fragments combined to form a sealed storage space, where the searched chess pieces were stored.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only by working together could the four take out the sealed chess pieces. In other cases, they could only observe and supervise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, the attention of the four-person group was mostly cast on these chess pieces from time to time. But with Li Fan inadvertently and proactively revealing the mystery of his supreme escape technique, the other three elders inevitably got distracted, pondering everything Li Fan had taught.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, Li Fan had more time to study the mysteries of these gray chess pieces without being noticed by the other three.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Transforming from the gray chess piece form again requires a large amount of energy support."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Spiritual energy is not enough, True Immortal power is also not enough."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But the Immortal Boat has, without a sound, transformed it into its current armored keratin form..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems there are still treasures in the second and third layers of the Immortal Boat's secret collection!" Li Fan snorted inwardly, his divine sense sweeping across the four gray chess pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Forged from the [world], perhaps they are chess pieces that have lost their value and turned gray."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the Heavenly Physician's 'Book of Mending the Heavens' compares the world to a person, then the existence that forged this set of chess pieces treats the world as a [tool]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although people and tools are different, the fundamental principle is the same."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The prerequisite for modification is complete control over its basic mechanism..." Sensing the four creations before him, Li Fan silently chanted the 【Book of Mending the Heavens】.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the characters in it, after Li Fan's comprehension and modification, transformed into another chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, it's like copying a gourd and drawing a picture, changing the principles of the human body to methods of forging tools."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although some parts were forcibly transformed and nonsensical, the vast majority..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is effective!" Li Fan's eyes brightened. In his vision, the four artifacts in the sealed space also changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The specific forms of the broken sword, war chariot, etc., no longer existed. Instead, they were replaced by intersecting bright lines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These lines all originated from a common starting point. Outside the lines, there were even more numerous and complex dim lines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The starting point of the lines is the original gray chess piece form."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And those dim lines represent the other switchable forms of the chess pieces."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"So beautiful..." Li Fan was almost mesmerized. He had once directly faced the principles of heaven and earth of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The horizontal and vertical lines that constitute the myriad different beings and scenes in heaven and earth, intertwined and spanning between heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, Li Fan thought the principles of heaven and earth that make up the Xuanhuang Realm were already complex enough. But compared to what was unfolding before his eyes...</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What constitutes the Xuanhuang Realm is only a small part of it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The rest was forged by True Immortals using the laws of the Immortal Realm, reaching beyond the world!" Li Fan's heart was inexplicably shaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Observing these, perhaps one can vaguely touch upon a corner of the former Immortal Realm!" Li Fan closed his eyes, feigning rest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In reality, it was to conceal the overwhelming waves that suddenly surged within his heart. The Immortal Realm suffered the 'Calamity of Dao Annihilation,' and had been destroyed for over ten thousand years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything about the former Immortal Realm had become a thing of the past. Even the True Immortals of yesteryear had now become extremely rare existences.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were hunted by civilizations beyond the high wall. But now, Li Fan had discovered fragments of the Immortal Realm, forged and hidden using special methods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or rather, to describe them as fragments was an exaggeration. It was merely that during the forging of lower realm cultivation worlds, some higher Immortal Realm law fragments were incorporated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, for those in the latter days after the immortal path was severed, this still held extremely extraordinary significance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially for Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The fragments of law contained within a single chess piece are too scarce."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But what if it's a complete set of chess pieces?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sun Piaomiao founded the Medicine King Sect. Judging purely from the medical principles, his understanding of the world and the Great Dao might not be inferior to the Heavenly Physician."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I can sense the subtleties of this chess piece, and Sun Piaomiao had no reason not to; especially since he left secrets for future generations in such a peculiar way through his travelogues."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the fragments of the Immortal Realm can truly be reproduced through fusion..." A flash of inspiration suddenly struck Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps this is a 'preserving the fire' plan in a sense?" But only for a fleeting moment did Li Fan naturally think of the use of these gray chess pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"My Xuanhuang sublimation plan was already quite perfect."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If we can add some fragments of the former Immortal Realm..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The laws of the Immortal Realm are like heavenly pillars, strengthening the principles of the Xuanhuang Realm's heaven and earth."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ascending to a true immortal domain is just around the corner!" Li Fan rapidly deduced the possibilities. The results made his heart throb with excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, if the Immortal Boat were truly to gather all these gray chess pieces, I'm afraid they would lose their ambition to cross the high wall." Li Fan, with his discerning eye, naturally saw that Zhong Daogong's previous words were merely to appease them for the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, this matter requires someone to cooperate with my act." After deliberation, his plan was set.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another day passed. Li Fan pretended to have barely recovered his condition. He vaguely sensed the locations of Yin Shangren and Bai Hua, then urged his wooden sword phantom and flew away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Coincidentally, his direction of travel overlapped with the sensing area of one of the chess pieces, so he did not arouse the suspicion of the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm? This place in the Great Wall of Remaining Realms seems to have changed a bit?" While flying, Li Fan suddenly said with feigned surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as he said this, the three Immortal Boat elders who were secretly comprehending the Dao were startled awake. They carefully investigated, then all shook their heads in confusion: "Could it be that Brother Li's excessive consumption has caused a misperception?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We don't feel anything out of the ordinary!" Facing the three's confusion, Li Fan still maintained a solemn expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he couldn't articulate any specific reason. The three Immortal Boat elders exchanged glances and couldn't help but become nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's inexplicable nervousness didn't seem like an act. Sometimes, cultivators' groundless vigilance could be even more accurate than active investigation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The four dared not be careless, their minds highly tense, guarding against potential disasters. However, it might indeed have been Li Fan's overthinking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A period of an incense stick passed, and nothing unusual happened. The tense three elders finally began to relax again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems Brother Li was worrying unnecessarily!" Nangong Lie said with a smile. Li Fan sighed, "Perhaps it is so!" and continued searching in the Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after calming down, Li Fan was startled again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No! Be careful!" In his alarm, the Immortal Boat elders' auras suddenly surged. The True Immortal script 'Seal' was still prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However... Scanning their surroundings and waiting for a long time, there were still no changes. The three elders stared at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan said somewhat sheepishly, "I don't know why today, I've been feeling restless, as if disaster is imminent..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps everyone doesn't know, my spiritual intuition for premonition has always been extremely accurate. It was precisely by relying on this keen spiritual intuition that I managed to avoid multiple fatal calamities..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have to believe it!" Li Fan said with a wry smile. Lu Yuzhi comforted him, "It's alright, being vigilant is good. Perhaps it's because you were exhausted from traveling before, and haven't recovered yet. Why don't you rest a bit longer?" Li Fan shook his head, "Stopping makes me feel even more uneasy. Let's continue." The three elders had no choice but to go along.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They could only continue following Li Fan. In the following time, after experiencing Li Fan's two staged alarms, the three Immortal Boat elders also became utterly exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nangong Lie seemed hesitant to speak. Lu Yuzhi was carefully considering, about to advise Li Fan to rest properly. Unbeknownst to them, Li Fan had already found Yin Shangren and Bai Hua.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And successfully, secretly contacted them. Soon, their communication was completed. In front of the three Immortal Boat elders, Li Fan's expression changed dramatically again, "Be careful!" The Immortal Boat elders, this time not only did not guard, but instead laughed in anger, "Brother Li, you..." Before he could finish speaking, an extremely terrifying deathly aura instantly surged forth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if they had personally fallen into a scene of world destruction. All four were slightly stunned. At the same time, the vitality within them began to drain at an extremely rapid pace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While everyone was in a daze, the sealed sphere that they jointly guarded, containing the four gray chess pieces, inexplicably lost control.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It fell out in the void.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Not good!" Nangong Lie's expression changed drastically, and he instantly woke up. The 'Town' character of the ancient script was immediately unleashed towards the direction where the deathly aura was attacking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the opponent seemed to have anticipated his actions and had already fled that area. Nangong Lie's attack missed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi also woke up at this time. He checked the situation of his companions rapidly draining vitality, his expression greatly changed.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-361" class="calibre1">Chapter 1344: Li Fan's Self-Defense</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders were far from as young as they appeared. Over thousands of years, they had repeatedly reversed their own aging through ancient scripts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning to youth, maintaining youth. But reversal could not be equated with eternal life. Old age still quietly accumulated within them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, Lu Yuzhi and the others, having suffered Yin Shangren's deathly aura attack, had the accumulated aging from past years erupt violently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The consequence was that the effect of the death script was far better than imagined. The three Immortal Boat members' hair instantly turned snow-white.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Deep wrinkles quickly claimed their faces. An aura of decay emerged from within their bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ancient!" Lu Yuzhi, having regained his senses, forced himself to calm down and quickly inscribed an ancient character in the void with slightly trembling hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The target was not an unknown enemy, but themselves!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the power of the "Ancient" character, the rapid aging of their bodies was somewhat alleviated, but it was only a temporary fix.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What was emanating was not genuine True Immortal script, but a crude imitation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The extent of the reversal of their past states was far less than the speed of their aging. And the surrounding deathly aura storm continued to intensify. If this continued, all four present would soon turn into mere white bones!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the combined influence of the deathly aura storm and the ancient script, Li Fan and Xu Gongding also abruptly woke up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their expressions were terrified, at a loss what to do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Leave quickly!" Lu Yuzhi desperately held on, shouting at Li Fan. Li Fan's already black and white streaked hair had completely turned snow-white.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he looked in the direction where the sealed sphere had disappeared, struggling: "But those gray chess pieces..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If life is gone, then nothing remains!" Lu Yuzhi's eyes also held reluctance, but he still roared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a roar like venting, the wooden sword phantom unsheathed, temporarily alleviating the onslaught of the deathly aura.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sword light flashed, carrying the four away from the terrifying deathly aura that filled the sky. As their figures disappeared into the horizon, Bai Hua and Yin Shangren slowly revealed their true forms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly unleashing such a large-scale deathly aura storm was not easy for Yin Shangren, who had just absorbed the Yin-Yang Orb.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if out of control, the vortex in his black and white eyes spun faster and faster. Yin Shangren had no choice but to close his eyes to calm himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Bai Hua, following Li Fan's instructions, she emitted golden light after golden light, sealing the sphere they had just snatched.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I wonder who those three companions of the Saint Master were?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The characters they struck, seem to be the same as the residual True Immortal power in the Star Sea..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But speaking of it, the Saint Master's acting is truly superb. If he hadn't actively transmitted a message for us to cooperate, I would have almost been deceived by him." Bai Hua's expression was subtle, and she continuously set up the sealing formation in her hand. ... Outside the Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat一行, having escaped disaster, still looked shaken. Even though they had escaped the range of the deathly aura storm, a small amount of deathly aura still remained within their bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was continuously reducing their lifespan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's return to the Immortal Boat first." Lu Yuzhi, at this moment, had become extremely frail, like an old man in his seventies or eighties in the mortal world, seemingly approaching the end of his life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even these short four words were spoken with all his remaining strength. The condition of the others was not much better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially Li Fan, who could only shake his head slightly, indicating that he was too weak to use his escape technique divine ability anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among the four, only Nangong Lie's condition was relatively better. He helped support everyone, flying towards the Immortal Boat while releasing a distress signal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a cup of tea, Zhong Daogong arrived with seven Immortal Boat elders in a hurry. To prevent it from being a diversionary tactic, they did not mobilize all their forces, even though the lives of four elders were in danger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong and the others who came to support looked at the four dying individuals enveloped in an aura of decay and senescence with solemn expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, knowing that saving their lives was the priority, they did not immediately pursue the reasons for the incident but first took the four back for treatment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Through the genuine True Immortal script "Ancient" and the efforts of many life-extending treasures, the four were finally temporarily pulled back from the brink of danger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three days later. Li Fan stood in the small courtyard, his expression somewhat dazed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Only about ten years of lifespan left."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just one trip out, and half of it is gone!" Lu Yuzhi smiled wryly upon hearing this, "My situation is similar to yours. Less than half a century..." Nangong Lie and Xu Gongding's expressions were also extremely grim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With such a major incident, the Elder Council would surely investigate meticulously. They truthfully recounted their experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong comforted them in every possible way and tried various methods to extend their lives, but the effects were minimal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmph!" The small courtyard fell silent for a moment. Suddenly, Nangong Lie slammed the stone table in the courtyard, "We suffered a great calamity, and by extension, the four gray chess pieces were also stolen..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's simply an utter humiliation! Elder Zhong should have immediately led everyone to, not to mention seeking justice, at least find out the specific details of the culprits."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But now, so much time has passed, and he hasn't made any moves. When asked, he speaks eloquently. 'We need to plan carefully'... Bah! I think he's just scared after seeing our impending doom!" Nangong Lie vented his dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lu Yuzhi frowned, "However, Elder Zhong's words are not entirely wrong. That deathly aura storm was indeed too bizarre and terrifying. Even after pondering it continuously for the past few days, I haven't found a way to confront it directly. The four of us were severely injured, and the Immortal Boat cannot withstand another similar blow in a short period." Li Fan also nodded in agreement, "Although it's helpless, it's indeed the case. This deathly aura appeared too suddenly; it was clearly aimed at our gray chess pieces."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't forget, the Immortal Boat still has one piece. Perhaps the unknown enemy will storm the gates at any time..." Li Fan's words made everyone present fall silent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat always prioritized the greater good. They could still distinguish between immediate grudges and the overall interests of the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The enemy is aggressive!" Lu Yuzhi sighed, his eyes full of worry. To deal with this unknown formidable enemy, the Immortal Boat soon convened a joint meeting of all elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, as an eyewitness to the event, also attended. Zhong Daogong first gave a summary statement: "The opponent is definitely after the gray chess pieces. Now, the gray chess piece we still hold has lost some of its connection to the other pieces, presumably due to the four pieces being abducted by the opponent."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, there are two points of doubt."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"First, how did they clearly pinpoint the location of Elder Lu Yuzhi's group?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Second, by what method did they conceal our gray chess piece's connection?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for the deathly aura storm used for the attack..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"After searching the Immortal Boat's records, we have found some possibilities." Zhong Daogong's words immediately attracted everyone's attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Dao Sheng clear his throat, he began to explain, "Deathly aura and vitality are opposites, yet they depend on each other. After the great destruction, the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, where most regions have fallen into silence, theoretically should not contain such a massive amount of deathly aura."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, we speculate that the origin of this deathly aura should be from a certain cultivation world."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And to use deathly aura as an offensive weapon in a consumable manner, the amount of deathly aura they possess... is definitely unimaginable." Seeing Dao Sheng's tone was somewhat heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing this, the Immortal Boat elders quickly raised their doubts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea calamity occurred long ago, and all realms were destroyed long ago. Where could they have gathered so much deathly aura?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's completely illogical!" Zhong Daogong sighed, "This is the crux of the problem. Perhaps this deathly aura was accumulated by the opponent from ancient times, before the Star Sea suffered its calamity."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The opponent is likely a civilization that has survived to this day, just like us."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"They could predict and evade the attack of True Immortal scripts; they understood the gray chess pieces made by True Immortals very well and caught us off guard. From beginning to end, the opponent never revealed themselves..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Judging from all their actions, this unknown civilization is stronger than our Immortal Boat, not weaker." Zhong Daogong finished speaking, and the meeting then fell into a strange silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All the elders frowned, lost in thought. Li Fan broke the silence, sighing, "Unexpectedly, this seemingly dead and silent Star Sea, besides the Immortal Boat and Da Qi, actually has other brilliant civilizations." The Immortal Boat elders' gazes all converged on Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Dao Sheng narrowing his eyes, he asked, "Fellow Daoist Li, could the unknown enemy that attacked you be your hometown, Da Qi?" This was also a question on the minds of all the Immortal Boat elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment, seeing Dao Sheng ask, everyone stared intently at Li Fan, wanting to hear his answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Da Qi?" Li Fan clearly did not expect Dao Sheng to ask this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How could..." He first subconsciously denied it. However, soon, as if realizing something, he frowned and fell into thought, his words suddenly stopping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, Li Fan spoke again, saying softly, "First of all, one thing I can be sure of is that there are absolutely no surveillance methods from Da Qi on me, and I would never be an insider for Da Qi..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I cannot produce any evidence. But after spending so much time with you all, you must understand my character." Li Fan paused, said proudly, "To put it bluntly, if I were truly a spy from Da Qi, and my target was the gray chess pieces, I could have stolen them and escaped directly with my escape technique that traverses the Star Sea when I helped rebuild the Immortal Boat's defensive formations."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There would be no need for all this trouble." The meeting became even quieter. No one retorted. Most people remained silent at Li Fan's words, but a few still looked at Li Fan with lingering suspicion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's self-defense continued, "Moreover, when we were attacked, we were planning to proceed deeper into the Great Wall of Remaining Realms to collect more. If I were truly an insider, why wait until after finding more before notifying them to capture them all?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"After the deed was done, why would I return to the Immortal Boat?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, the other three Immortal Boat elders were all extremely weak. If it weren't for my escape technique helping them, they would have likely perished. Wouldn't it have been better to make them disappear without a trace, doing things without anyone noticing? Why go through so much trouble?" Li Fan spoke more and more angrily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He coldly snorted, "If it weren't for the fact that my last moments with the Immortal Boat were intertwined, making me regard the Immortal Boat as my final destination, I wouldn't be wasting words with you all."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If I wanted to leave, who among you could stop me?" No one among the Immortal Boat elders could refute. After all, that wooden sword phantom could ignore almost all restrictive powers, which was truly unbelievable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong hurriedly stepped forward to smooth things over at this moment. He chuckled and appeased, "Fellow Daoist Li, there's no need to be so agitated. We absolutely trust you, but we know too little about Da Qi behind you, so it's natural to be suspicious." Li Fan's anger somewhat subsided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He pondered for a moment and answered cautiously, "Da Qi has numerous factions internally. I am only familiar with the research of my master's lineage..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, I have indeed never heard of anyone in Da Qi possessing such a vast amount of deathly aura."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Moreover, my face carries some renown in Da Qi. If the opponent were truly from Da Qi, they would never dare to attack me! Otherwise, even if I died, my master would not let him off!" Li Fan said with great certainty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong nodded slightly, temporarily stopping the interrogation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Regarding the origin of this attack, I have some conjectures. I will share them for everyone to discuss."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The gray chess pieces have been lying peacefully in the Immortal Boat's secret treasury for so many years without any incident. Now, they are suddenly attacked..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Excluding the possibility of someone deliberately leaking information, perhaps it was the aggregation of too many chess pieces that attracted attention." Zhong Daogong said loudly, "This unknown civilization might have been searching for traces of the gray chess pieces for many years. But lacking gray chess pieces in hand, they couldn't search by sensing."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But during our collection process, the accumulation of numbers allowed them to find traces. Thus, we were exposed and attacked..." The elders present all fell into deep thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing this, it sounded rather bizarre, but it was the only plausible explanation at present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If my guess is correct, then what we need to worry about now is the attack of this unknown civilization on the Immortal Boat." Zhong Daogong's tone suddenly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The gray chess pieces can sense each other. The one that transformed into the Immortal Boat's outer keratin armor can undoubtedly always provide the opponent with the general location of the Immortal Boat..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is clearly unacceptable to us." The Immortal Boat elders' expressions changed drastically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The urgent matter is to resolve this."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Either, strip off the keratin armor and separate it from the Immortal Boat, and simply abandon the gray chess piece."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Or, find a way to block the sensing between the gray chess pieces." Zhong Daogong summarized. The Immortal Boat elders looked at each other, falling into a debate for a time.</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall. Keeping the vital lifeline of the Immortal Boat constantly exposed to enemy surveillance is never a wise move!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"That's right. Although these gray chess pieces are True Immortal creations, they are not worth us taking such a great risk."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How foolish! This set of chess pieces must hide a great secret. Benefits always come with risks. How can we give it up so easily!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, it is too much of a shame to discard it just like that. I have a plan. Since the..."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-363" class="calibre1">Chapter 1346: Bearing the Burden of the Immortal Realm</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the Profound Immortal Boat had previously speculated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each gray chess piece was forged from a world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the four spinning chess pieces before him, and scenes flashed through his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These were the scenes of these four dead worlds before they were transformed: endless icy lands stretching for thousands of miles; on endless plains, dynasties established by different cultivators stood tall; a terrifying sword mark splitting the world, surrounded by sparse Sword Dao Sects of enlightenment; a vast blue ocean covering the entire world, with terrifying storms raging year-round, raising giant waves thousands of feet high, destroying everything on the sea surface. Beings could only survive underwater...</p>
<p class="calibre2">The names of the four worlds also appeared in Li Fan's mind along with these illusions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Crystal Extreme, Hundred Qiu, Sword Gate, Abyss Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the scenes were different, these four worlds were all full of life. However, at a certain moment, unimaginably terrifying power descended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything in the world fell into stillness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amidst the impact sounds like heavy hammers striking, all life was instantly annihilated. Only the world itself could survive this destructive blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like a block of iron heated and melted into liquid, after cooling and hammering, it was forged into a sword. The four disparate worlds also slowly underwent inexplicable changes in their form and essence amidst the rumbling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The chaotic illusions disappeared. Finally, they returned to the four incessantly spinning gray chess pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Master, this..." It was not only Li Fan who sensed the extraordinariness of the gray chess pieces. Yin Shangren's rapidly spinning black and white eyes also indicated his inner turmoil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Forging chess pieces with worlds. The power of True Immortals is truly extraordinary." Li Fan glanced faintly at Yin Shangren, then sighed softly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"True Immortals, chess pieces?" Yin Shangren, catching the two keywords, trembled slightly. He immediately said, "Indeed, my premonition was correct. The Yin-Yang Orb I absorbed before might also be related to True Immortals!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at Yin Shangren, waiting for him to continue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren paused, seemingly organizing his thoughts. Then, he said calmly, "The moment I saw these four chess pieces, I felt a sense of familiarity in my heart. Not that I had seen them before, but a familiarity of the same species. Like how I see those world ghosts..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyes flickered. After pondering for a moment, he nodded, "The immense deathly aura and vitality contained within the Yin-Yang dual orbs are likely beyond the control of us cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren continued, "But these... chess pieces, while I feel familiar with them, I also instinctively feel a sense of fear. As if in a strict hierarchy, they are high above!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I also feel that although the power of life and death no longer exists in these worlds, they still have a great attraction for me. It's as if swallowing them would bring me immense benefits! Benefits even greater than the Yin-Yang dual orbs!" Yin Shangren's tone gradually became hazy. Before the greed in his eyes could become uncontrollable, he closed his eyes in time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, the seductive whispers of celestial demons seemed to disappear from his ears, and he gradually returned to normal. However, he dared not look at the four chess pieces again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan naturally knew the source of the fear and temptation that the gray chess pieces brought to Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Originating from fragments of Immortal Realm laws..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Silently circulating the mutated version of the Book of Mending the Heavens, in Li Fan's vision, the four chess pieces once again transformed into intersecting horizontal and vertical lines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These were the principles of worlds that had been forged and transformed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan compared the similarities and differences between them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tens of thousands of years have passed, the Star Sea was destroyed and then revived. But the Great Dao principles that formed the foundation of the worlds had not changed much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Through countless reincarnations, Li Fan had gained a profound understanding of the principles of heaven and earth in cultivation worlds. After several observations and comparisons, he truly discovered the parts within these four chess pieces that did not belong to the "lower realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">They seemed indistinguishable from the lines representing ordinary heavenly principles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In reality, they were higher-level replacements and transformed newborn forms of lower realm laws.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they were merely fragments used for construction, in Li Fan's eyes, they were as brilliant as the most dazzling gems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the principles of heaven and earth in the lower realm were like a low mountain less than a hundred meters high. Then the parts originating from the Immortal Realm within these four chess pieces were like magnificent mountain ranges stretching for hundreds of miles. All-encompassing and full of vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two were fundamentally incomparable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, whether by coincidence or not, the fragments of Immortal Realm laws contained within these four chess pieces were different from each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The laws contained within each chess piece are like a puzzle piece. When fully integrated, perhaps it will form a complete picture."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are thirteen gray chess pieces in total, corresponding to the twelve Dao mark information left by Sun Piaomiao back then."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In that case..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There should actually be thirteen. The Medicine King Cauldron of the Medicine King Sect, inherited since ancient times in the Xuanhuang Realm, is not within the sensing range."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but look outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Medicine King Cauldron of the Medicine King Sect was still struggling near the Immortal Ruins, not yet returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's not far from its falling date, so I'll wait. There's no need to risk going to the Immortal Ruins to retrieve it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan thought this, then reached out and took a chess piece.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, a peculiar sensation surged into his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the darkness, he felt the approximate location information of the gray chess pieces in the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are four here in total."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's one on the Profound Immortal Boat."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are four more within the continuous Great Wall of Remaining Realms."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are three more; one of them is located in the Sea of Relic Treasures."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The remaining two..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A flicker of strangeness flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because he discovered that these two gray chess pieces were actually located within the Xuanhuang Realm!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Their original worlds were likely used by the Heavenly Physician and Transmitting Dharma to repair the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Looking at this place, I'll be back soon." Li Fan ordered Yin Shangren and Bai Hua. Disregarding their astonishment, the wooden sword phantom flashed, and Li Fan first headed towards one of the locations indicated by the sensing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the bottomless Cangwu Abyss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Cangwu Abyss, located in the southwest corner of the Xuanhuang Realm, was like a giant rift in the Xuanhuang Realm. Its currently explored depth had reached three hundred thousand feet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within it, layers of strange scenes, events, and objects were distributed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The former perilous land, to Li Fan, who could now traverse the Star Sea, hardly posed any threat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Following the sense, all the way down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan looked at the scenery constantly floating upwards in his vision and suddenly felt a sense of "The various things within the Cangwu Abyss should come from different destroyed cultivation worlds. They are piled here, like a temporary storage place for the materials during the process of stitching together the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If anything is missing during the repair of the world, it can be taken from here at any time. One day, this Cangwu Abyss will be filled. However, by then, the Xuanhuang Realm will have perhaps been reborn."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan observed the strange sights within the abyss with great interest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The closer the abyss got to the surface of the Xuanhuang Realm, the greater the influence of the Xuanhuang Realm's life aura. This fused to create various unique landscapes, such as the Forest of Spirit Language, the Puppet's Ravine, and the Lost City.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the deeper he went, the closer the world fragments floating around were to their original appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the world's destruction, it was a scene of desolation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were even traces of True Immortal power remaining on some world fragments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It can be seen as a small-scale Great Wall of Remaining Realms."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, its stability is not as high as the true Great Wall of Remaining Realms. The residual True Immortal power that accumulates from time to time will still erupt..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No wonder this is a forbidden zone for cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the sword shadow descended, reaching a depth of five hundred and thirty thousand feet underground, Li Fan once again sensed the existence of the 'Immortal Suppressing Power' within the abyss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Immortal Suppressing Power should be the pressure exerted on cultivators who intrude into the Cangwu Abyss after the Heavenly Physician imitated the Great Wall of Remaining Realms and constructed the Cangwu Abyss."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To be precise, the 'momentum' of the Cangwu Abyss, from top to bottom, is a stepped increase. Although the height difference is extremely limited, and the overall height does not exceed the Xuanhuang Realm by much, it is extremely obvious to the cultivators within the abyss."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Only by reaching the corresponding cultivation level can one safely survive in the abyss layer with the corresponding 'potential height.' Otherwise, it would be like a mortal accidentally entering the Immortal Realm, arriving at a height that does not belong to oneself, only to be crushed."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having deciphered the mystery of the Cangwu Abyss, Li Fan had also roughly located the position of the gray chess piece wandering within this area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a pile of scattered ruins that looked like they had been chopped by thousands of sword marks, Li Fan found the fifth gray chess piece.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a majestic and imposing Qilin stone statue, half-fallen on the ground, just as it was during the destruction ten thousand years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The stone statue was a pair, but the other one Li Fan checked was just ordinary stone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's well hidden."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan crushed the stone statue, restoring it to the form of a chess piece, and then looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Based on the appearance of the surrounding ruins, Li Fan also restored the world to which it originally belonged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Seven Fiends Realm. Seven types of fiendish qi raged within the realm, permeating all parts of the world. They could even take form and harm people. Therefore, all buildings in this realm were equipped with large and small beasts of different types to absorb and suppress them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It was once a cultivation world of considerable scale. The cultivators of the Seven Fiends Realm were infected with fiendish qi from birth, and every move they made carried the characteristics of the seven fiends. Even peerless geniuses possessed all seven..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Unfortunately, time flows. Everything has long since turned to dust." Li Fan sighed lightly and left the place, shaking his head slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The remaining gray chess piece within the Xuanhuang Realm was buried underground in Tianyun Prefecture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were no unusual phenomena at the location.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It should be that with the progress of the Xuanhuang Realm's fusion, fragments originally within other world fragments have now completely entered the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Just like the fragments from the Heavenly Law Realm at the bottom of the Congyun Sea. Under normal circumstances, they would be buried deep under the Congyun Mountain as the evolution progresses."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without alarming anyone, Li Fan smoothly obtained it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Up to this point, Li Fan had collected six gray chess pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Returning to the Great Profound Minor World's Dao Platform, he placed these six chess pieces together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the number approached half, the influence between these chess pieces seemed to become stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They rotated around each other faster and faster.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan saw that during this high-speed rotation, the lines representing the principles of the world were attracting each other and slowly merging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the fragments of Immortal Realm laws slowly approached, filling in the puzzle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it was only six out of thirteen, it was enough to support a qualitative change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Realm law puzzle was like a void appearing in the center of the ocean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The worlds that had fallen into stillness were like calm seawater.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment the void appeared, the seawater surged in uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The six worlds, like wet, distorted planes, were sucked into the fragments of the Immortal Realm law puzzle like liquid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the template designed by the puzzle, a new world was presented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Blue sky, white clouds, rolling green grasslands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A seemingly ordinary scene of a mortal grassland.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan felt an unprecedented vastness between heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The small green grass growing vigorously on the ground also contained unimaginable vitality!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Immortal Realm?!" Li Fan was greatly shocked upon glimpsing the scene within the merged chess pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"No, it's just a fragment of a former Immortal Realm. Perhaps 'Immortal Domain' is a more appropriate description."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And this Immortal Domain is still incomplete."</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was clearly something that should exist between the Immortal Realm grasslands and the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, because the remaining seven gray chess pieces were missing, it could not be fully presented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stared blankly at the scene in the eye circles, a sense of regret suddenly arising.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if he had personally smashed a priceless treasure, and the urge to repair it surged uncontrollably from all parts of his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If Li Fan did not have the Immortal Heart Curse protecting him, and had not experienced so many similar situations, he would have lost control at this moment and rushed to chase after the remaining chess pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, Li Fan ignored this temptation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the fusion was completed, only one chess piece remained in the field. It was no longer gray, but flickered with seven-colored light from time to time. Its size even expanded by a circle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan reached out and solemnly collected the six-in-one chess piece.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"En?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">To Li Fan's surprise, the moment he collected this chess piece into his body, he felt as if he were being crushed by countless mountains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Caught off guard, his body plummeted a few feet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, he reacted in time, and the power of the Xuanhuang World Destruction Transformation revived and circulated, providing a steady stream of power. He managed to withstand it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is... the weight of the Immortal Realm?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even a fragmented Immortal Domain is so difficult for me to bear?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If all thirteen fragments are gathered and fused into a true Immortal Domain, with my current cultivation, I won't be able to bear it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan once again felt the terrifying difference between Immortals and mortals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But at the same time, he was delighted rather than alarmed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I was just worried that after the Xuanhuang Realm ascended and reached that state, I wouldn't find an anchor to support that state."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Now, it seems that if this Immortal Domain is integrated into the Xuanhuang Realm, it will definitely adapt and not easily fall."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"With this Immortal Domain as the core, the Xuanhuang Realm might even ascend higher!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Truly, heaven is helping me!" Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little excited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But soon, instinctively, he began to doubt the origin of these Immortal Domain fragments.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-364" class="calibre1">Chapter 1347: The Will of the Immortal Boat</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">These fragments of Immortal Realm laws appeared at too coincidental a time. Just as he was about to promote the Xuanhuang Realm's ascension towards the Immortal Realm, they were conveniently discovered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given Li Fan's personality, it was hard not to be suspicious. Thus, he attempted to slowly untangle the logical threads within.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The concealment of the chess pieces is truly formidable. The entire Immortal Boat, and the Heavenly Physician and Transmitting Dharma, even after tens of thousands of years and countless direct interactions, have not perceived any abnormality within them."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The reason I discovered the peculiarity of the chess pieces so easily was entirely due to the guidance of [Returning to True]. Without Returning to True, I would have also regarded them as ordinary objects..." Thinking of this, Li Fan's heart stirred slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If we only consider this aspect, the chess pieces could indeed be bait specifically targeting [Returning to True]."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However... there are many things that only Returning to True can sense. For example, [Eternal Remnant Will]. It is purely because the level of Returning to True is too high that all these abnormalities are completely exposed before it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I cannot make a hasty conclusion. But it is reasonable to be cautious." Li Fan observed the seven-colored chess piece quietly lying within his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The chess piece seemed completely independent of Li Fan. Spiritual energy, divine sense, and other powers flowed through the location of the chess piece without any obstruction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if it didn't exist at all. And besides the "burden" of the merged Immortal Domain fragments, this chess piece brought no other influence to Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thirteen gray chess pieces were hidden by Sun Piaomiao in thirteen cultivation worlds he had traveled through. And he recorded their world Dao mark information in his travelogues, passing them down to his descendants."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But clearly, these chess pieces were not forged by Sun Piaomiao, but by True Immortals of the upper realms. Perhaps in the context of the 'Calamity of Dao Annihilation' erupting, some pessimists prepared these, seeking the resurrection of the Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"For some unknown reason, they fell into Sun Piaomiao's hands." Li Fan pondered, his thoughts surging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"During Sun Piaomiao's era, the Immortal Realm had not yet been destroyed, and the immortal path was not severed. Most True Immortals of the Immortal Realm were actively fighting against the Calamity of Dao Annihilation. It is conceivable that against such a backdrop, True Immortals who were pessimists and forged the chess pieces would not be accepted by the mainstream, and could only act in secret. Thus, they secretly passed them down to the lower realms?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But for some unknown reason, these backup plans have not been activated to this day. The most likely scenario is that the True Immortal who forged the chess pieces has already perished in the Calamity of Dao Annihilation that destroyed the Immortal Realm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Or perhaps..." Li Fan's eyes narrowed, recalling the structure of the Immortal Boat's Myriad Manifestations Yin-Yang Diagram from before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea cannot find any black and white chess pieces still on the chessboard. Only these 'discarded' gray chess pieces remain. Perhaps, in some unknown place, beyond this high wall, those black and white chess pieces have already completed the mission of recreating the Immortal Realm?" However, this was merely Li Fan's conjecture, with no evidence to support it at present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Regarding these gray chess pieces, Sun Piaomiao must have known more. Sun Piaomiao himself is missing. If there are any clues left in the Star Sea, the most likely place is the Medicine King Cauldron he left behind in the Medicine King Sect."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Anchoring for fifteen years, 'Starfall Returns to Xuanhuang.' It's coming soon..." Although these chess pieces might hide dangers behind them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan would certainly not give up on the plan to sublimate the Xuanhuang Realm by integrating the Immortal Domain fragments just because of a mere "possibility" of speculation. With the fragments of the Immortal Domain as the foundation, the success rate of the Xuanhuang Realm's sublimation increased significantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan calmed his thoughts and looked at Yin Shangren and Bai Hua. They had also witnessed the entire process of the gray chess pieces merging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They did not dare to speak, only watched silently. Li Fan did not explain the creation of the Immortal Domain fragments after the fusion of the chess pieces to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But they had guessed that these chess pieces, forged from dead worlds, probably played a crucial role in the Xuanhuang sublimation plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I asked you to go to that location in the depths of the Star Sea before; did you find anything?" Since returning to Da Qi, Li Fan had been busy collecting chess pieces and only now finally had some leisure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan stared at Bai Hua and asked, In Li Fan's estimation, it should have taken Bai Hua considerable effort to investigate that unknown "high ground." Unexpectedly, she returned not long after and rendezvoused with Yin Shangren to search for Xu Ke's whereabouts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua brewed for a moment and explained, "Perhaps it's my incompetence. I searched for a long time in the direction you indicated, Saint Master, but found no abnormalities. Seeing that it was a waste of time to stay any longer, I had no choice but to give up and search for Xu Ke's whereabouts with Daoist Yin."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps that opportunity was not meant for me," Bai Hua sighed. Li Fan nodded and asked again, "Then, have you found any traces of Xu Ke?" Yin Shangren replied, "We have made some progress. We discovered that Xu Ke might have been drawn into a strange zone within the Great Wall of Remaining Realms. The Great Wall of Remaining Realms is the convergence of countless destroyed worlds at the foot of the high wall. Although there are billions of fragments, they are still subtly connected as one."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"We don't quite understand the principle of its formation yet, but perhaps it can be seen as a long rope woven from countless thin threads. And the place where Xu Ke disappeared is a 'node' formed to maintain its self-stability."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, just as we were about to further explore that node, we received a transmission from Saint Master." Yin Shangren said with some regret.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Node..." Li Fan pondered for a moment and continued, "It was also a sudden occurrence, and to obtain the chess pieces, I had to ask you to help me perform a play."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Those people you saw that day were all from the Immortal Boat civilization on the edge of the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"To avoid exposing the Xuanhuang Realm's existence, I previously disguised myself as a member of the non-existent [Da Qi] civilization and contacted them. The Profound Immortal Boat is extremely adept at deconstructing the power of various True Immortal scripts remaining in the Star Sea, and I also engaged in several exchanges with them using the True Immortal scripts I mastered, so we both gained something."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"During this transaction, we accidentally discovered the existence of gray chess pieces within the Immortal Boat's treasury."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"These chess pieces are too important for Xuanhuang's sublimation, and I absolutely cannot miss them. Thus, I employed a little trick..." Li Fan casually explained the cause and effect to the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Profound Immortal Boat is still somewhat useful to the Xuanhuang Realm right now, so avoid contact with them to prevent exposure. Especially since the life and death aura on you is too prominent; anyone who sees you will know you snatched the gray chess pieces," Li Fan said to Yin Shangren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren and Bai Hua naturally would not side with the Profound Immortal Boat. They just smiled and didn't pay much attention to Li Fan's act of snatching the gray chess pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat still has several chess pieces left in the Great Wall of Remaining Realms that have not been collected, all of which can be handed over to me. You should still prioritize searching for Xu Ke's whereabouts first."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When I have collected all the chess pieces, it won't be far from the final stage of Xuanhuang's ascension," Li Fan instructed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren's expression turned solemn, and he nodded in agreement. After giving the instructions, Li Fan first used the Great Heaven's End咫尺 Array and arrived at the edge of the Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wooden sword phantom shuttled continuously, and it took considerable effort to collect all the remaining four gray chess pieces from this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with a heaven-defying escape technique, the depths of the Great Wall of Remaining Realms under the high wall were truly fraught with danger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fluctuating Star Power, which rose and fell like surging waves, could only be barely offset by Li Fan's wooden sword phantom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He still had to face the pervasive suction's influence. Coupled with the constant burden of the Immortal Domain, Li Fan's execution of the wooden sword phantom escape technique consumed almost two to three times more energy than before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, after collecting the four chess pieces from here, Li Fan's mind and body had become extremely exhausted. However, he had ultimately gained a great harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan gazed into his body. The four gray chess pieces and the one seven-colored chess piece that had expanded by a circle floated quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were in opposition. Perhaps because the quantity was too small, these newly acquired four chess pieces only rotated around each other and could not react with the already fused seven-colored chess piece.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Only two remain. The Profound Immortal Boat, and the Medicine King Sect."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Once all thirteen chess pieces are in place, if my predictions are correct, a corner of the former Immortal Realm should be recreated." Li Fan's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he extended his palm and struck his chest fiercely. With a muffled grunt, his previously tired face became even paler.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without mobilizing his spiritual energy to heal his injuries, Li Fan maintained his current appearance and slowly headed towards the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Approaching the Immortal Boat, without concealing his aura, the elders reacted. Led by Zhong Daogong, they came out to greet him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I have not failed in my mission." Li Fan coughed lightly, cupped his hands, and said calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thank you for your hard work, fellow Daoist!" Zhong Daogong's expression was solemn, and he actually bowed. Li Fan frowned and dodged, flashing aside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He coldly snorted and said, "Stop with these pleasantries. Although the ritual wasn't complicated, it took me considerable effort to conceal it from my master and all the Saint Masters."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I don't know the exact number of people the ritual will encompass, but it should be enough." Zhong Daogong nodded with a smile, "Approximately one hundred million living beings. This is absolutely sufficient to bear the backlash of casting the 'Universal Divine Technique'."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since that's the case, there's no need to hide it from me anymore, right?" Li Fan swept his gaze across all the elders present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is not a place to talk. Let's discuss it further after entering the Immortal Boat." The Immortal Boat elders were as cautious as ever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone entered the deepest pavilion in the Immortal Severing Tower at the top of the Divine Tree. Profound patterns were already carved on the black mysterious jade floor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was no stranger to these symbols. They were part of the Universal Divine Technique ritual. It seemed the Immortal Boat elders were already impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders sat according to their respective seats. Li Fan also obtained his position here. With one hundred million living beings as a foundation offering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten million humans, this was an unimaginable number in the Xuan Immortal Boat, where survival resources were scarce and life was dwindling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, after Li Fan completed the ritual, coupled with his previous performances, he finally earned the absolute trust of everyone on the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fellow Daoist, please remain calm."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Please take your seat first and try the effect of the [Universal Divine Technique]." Zhong Daogong pointed to Li Fan's seat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not hesitate at all, floating into his seat. The patterns beneath him instantly emitted faint light. After sitting down, Li Fan's vision also changed under the illumination of the faint light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The positions of the surrounding Immortal Boat elders shifted strangely in space. Originally, they were all sitting on the same plane, but now, in Li Fan's eyes, everyone was distributed in a three-dimensional cube space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dispersed and orderly, occupying every part of the cube. And Li Fan was at the center of the cube, the focus of everyone's attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's expression remained unchanged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Vast heaven and earth, ancient and obscure. Originally one entity, all beings are equal..." The chanting of the Immortal Boat elders came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ancient and vast. With a hint of strangeness. As the chanting continued, the elders raised their arms one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using their fingers as brushes, they began to write in the void before them. What each person wrote was not a complete True Immortal script.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was just a segment of a complex structure. In Li Fan's view, countless moving lines suddenly rose around him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These lines surrounded him, and as they were constantly perfected, a character 'Jun' (均) slowly took shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boom! Instantly, Li Fan's body trembled. His vision uncontrollably floated upward, eventually stopping at a fixed position.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And here, looking down, the spell structures written by all the elders on different planes, when combined, formed the character 'Jun' (均) on a single plane!</p>
<p class="calibre2">And his body, Li Fan, was suppressed in the center by this 'Jun'! The 'Jun' character was more complex than the 'Hunger' and 'Chaos' characters Li Fan had seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although not comparable to 'Creation,' it possessed a unique and profound mystique. Under the power of the Universal Divine Technique, Li Fan also slowly felt the changes occurring in his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan even checked the 'Returning to True' panel. His lifespan, which had only been about 10 years left, was actually slowly increasing!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wisps of black appeared amongst his white hair. Streams of vitality emerged from nowhere, nourishing Li Fan's decaying body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan was not overjoyed by this sudden increase in lifespan, but cautiously continued to observe [Returning to True].</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only when the incoming vitality gradually depleted and the Universal Divine Technique ritual ended did Li Fan finally relax, except for the change in his physiological age on the panel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected, a mere 'Jun' character is not enough to affect Returning to True."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It can only affect the target locked by the Universal Divine Technique, such as the lifespan that was cast on me this time."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for other aspects, such as divine sense and cultivation, there were no changes." After carefully inspecting his internal condition, Li Fan drew his conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the members of the Immortal Boat Elder Council. Compared to before the ritual, they had all undoubtedly aged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, due to the decay of lifespan and its equal distribution among everyone, the effect was not very obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How do you feel?" Zhong Daogong, representing all the elders, asked. Li Fan heard this, pretended to awaken as if from a dream, looked at his rejuvenated body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, he bowed respectfully to all the elders, expressing his gratitude for this life-saving grace. The Immortal Boat elders all returned the bow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"From now on, we are family." Zhong Daogong said very solemnly.</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-365" class="calibre1">Chapter 1348: The Immortal Boat Plunders the Heavens' Merit</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"A life-saving kindness is beyond repayment. I would not hesitate to go through fire and water!" Li Fan cupped his hands in response.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he spoke, Li Fan checked his attributes on the "Returning to True" panel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His remaining lifespan had skyrocketed from a mere ten years to over five hundred years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was enough to demonstrate the formidable power of the "Universal Divine Technique."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"After being subjected to the divine technique, my lifespan should be similar to these Immortal Boat elders."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Over five hundred years is not a lot, but it's not insignificant either. Most importantly..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan meticulously examined his current physical state.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, his eyes narrowed slightly: "This extra lifespan is unstable?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Previously, his body had been healthy and normal, so Li Fan was acutely aware that his current body, forcibly defying fate and extending its lifespan through the Universal Divine Technique, had a noticeably abnormal and rapid aging rate. It was several times faster than normal, and sometimes, it would suddenly and inexplicably decrease.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And as Li Fan observed, the suddenly fluctuating numbers on the "Returning to True" panel undeniably confirmed his guess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not conceal his change in expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong also noticed Li Fan's confusion: "The Heavenly Dao is inconstant, its flow uncertain. Change is eternal, balance is temporary."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Balancing the world under heaven is inherently an act against the natural order. I suspect that even a True Immortal's script, if written by a genuine immortal, might not be able to maintain the 'balanced' state indefinitely. Let alone us? So you need not doubt; falling from the 'balanced' state is entirely normal."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"There are two methods to alleviate this. First, by using an authentic True Immortal script of 'Ancient,' a brief regression can slow down the rate of decline."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Second, you can simply cast the 'Universal Divine Technique' again when your lifespan runs out. In fact, this is precisely what the Immortal Boat Elder Council is doing."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sharing our lifespans to extend one individual's lifespan. Everyone helps me, and I also help everyone," Zhong Daogong said with a smile, looking at the surrounding elders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan suddenly understood, "Since that's the case, I am relieved."</p>
<p class="calibre2">He sighed and then lamented, "Finally, I understand why the Immortal Boat elders, despite their apparent disagreements, always manage to ensure collective progress on major matters."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This Universal Divine Technique is truly profoundly mysterious! Even in Da Qi, it would undoubtedly be considered a top-tier divine ability!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite Li Fan's high praise, Zhong Daogong did not show any elation. Instead, a wry smile flickered in his eyes: "It is merely a last resort. Limited by our finite resources, the Immortal Boat's population has always been maintained at a low level. The rate of talent succession is slow. To survive in this Utmost Darkness Star Sea, we must maintain the number of council members."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Researching True Immortal scripts is also fraught with peril. A slight misstep can lead to being affected by True Immortal power. Quite a few elders have perished this way historically. Yet, it concerns the future and very survival of the Immortal Boat, and we absolutely cannot abandon it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, every elder is the Immortal Boat's most precious asset..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan remained noncommittal regarding Zhong Daogong's explanation. He was well aware of the Immortal Boat's secret technique of the "Dao Pill," which allowed them to refine talented individuals and absorb their innate talents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It's likely that not a few geniuses have emerged from the Immortal Boat in recent years. Unfortunately, to become a new elder, talent alone is not enough. Immortal Boat elders are, in essence, somewhat similar to mortals in the Xuanhuang Realm. Neither too many nor too few are allowed; a delicate balance must be maintained." Li Fan mused silently, not voicing his thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After undergoing the Universal Divine Technique, the elders' attitudes towards him subtly shifted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If Li Fan had previously earned their approval solely through calculated efforts for mutual benefit, then now, the elders genuinely felt a sense of camaraderie.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They truly treated him like "family."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, Li Fan inquired about the "Universal Plan," which required the sacrifice of Da Qi beings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Such a vast number of beings are needed to bear the backlash. Who is the true target of the Universal Divine Technique...?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, Zhong Daogong and the others did not hesitate or conceal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They directly revealed the answer: "Our planned target is precisely..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea's Origin Consciousness!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's eyes immediately lit up upon hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Thanks to fellow Daoist Li's prior teaching of the 'Tai Jia Divine Technique,' we were able to glimpse the vast Star Sea consciousness that is currently recovering."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Only by personally contacting it can we understand the boundless power of the Star Sea. Its might is not diminished by the annihilation of the Star Sea, and it remains beyond the comprehension of mere mortal cultivators."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But..." The Immortal Boat elders all wore strange expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Dao Sheng wave his hand, he displayed before Li Fan a scene of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea in utter desolation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And in the center of the Star Sea, shining with a brilliant, diamond-like radiance, was the Star Sea's Origin True Will.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea's consciousness is essentially the same as the Heavenly Dao of the cultivation world in the past."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In ancient times, there were cultivators who achieved unity of heaven and humanity and could partially control the world's Heavenly Dao. Now, by jointly casting the Universal Divine Technique, perhaps we can also share the Star Sea's power!" Jian Dao Sheng said forcefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong stroked his beard and chuckled, "If we can truly balance the Star Sea's power, then crossing the high wall might be within reach, even without the assistance of True Immortal scripts!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan frowned, deep in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a while, he slowly nodded, "Although the high wall blocks the Utmost Darkness Star Sea, that is for beings within the Star Sea. If we were to harness the Star Sea's own power and generate immense tidal waves, perhaps the droplets within those waves could leap over the high wall!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Precisely! Only by reaching the height of True Immortals can one cross the high wall. But the Star Sea's power is inherently not inferior to True Immortals! In ancient times, the numerous anomalies that shone in the Star Sea forced even True Immortals to temporarily avoid their path. This shows the might of the Star Sea's power. Even after being affected by the Calamity of Immortals and falling into a state of destruction, its vitality was not extinguished..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elders' voices grew increasingly excited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is precisely our perfect target for 'balancing'!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the ritual succeeds, even if we cannot lift the Immortal Boat and leap over the high wall, controlling the Star Sea's power for a time would be enough to create an absolutely safe haven for us within this Utmost Darkness Star Sea!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">After Li Fan listened to the Immortal Boat elders' plan, he couldn't help but clap his hands and exclaim, "Brilliant! Brilliant!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is what is called 'coveting the heavens' merits for personal gain.' However..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's tone suddenly shifted, and he frowned, "I have communicated with the Star Sea's consciousness using the Tai Jia Divine Technique before. As cultivators, we are truly like ants before it. And now, this group of ants dares to covet power as if to stand on equal footing..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's expression turned somber as he looked at everyone, "The heavens have their wrath, and the Star Sea will also have its fury. Even if it succeeds, we will likely face the Star Sea Origin Consciousness's mad retaliation. Not to mention if it fails."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At that time, perhaps it won't be our Immortal Boat that can withstand it!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Failure means a glorious death... Isn't the risk a bit too great?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had thoroughly integrated into the scenario of having gained five hundred years of lifespan, his thoughts and actions no longer as extreme as before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong nodded, agreeing with Li Fan's viewpoint, "You are right. The Immortal Boat is not yet at a point where it must stake everything. That is why you went to Da Qi."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong was full of confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan expressed some confusion, "Simply relying on ten million human lives can appease the Star Sea's wrath?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong smiled, his eyes gleaming, "Not by using humans. But by using worlds!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If it were merely a matter of human numbers, even multiplied several times, it might not make much difference to the Star Sea's Origin Consciousness. But if, using the lives of these ten million humans as a foundation, decorating them into a world, and presenting it in the name of a world, to draw away the Star Sea's power..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea's backlash will be greatly weakened!" Zhong Daogong asserted confidently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is due to the Star Sea's own mechanisms. Based on the traces recorded by the Immortal Boat in the past, we are almost certain of this point."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan quieted down, contemplating Zhong Daogong's words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Nurturing and evolving cultivation worlds is an inherent fundamental law of the Star Sea. Even if a cultivation world becomes powerful enough to influence the Star Sea, the Star Sea will not directly destroy it."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"At most, it will manifest in various forms of Star Sea anomalies."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Star Sea anomalies are far easier to deal with compared to the wrath of the Star Sea's origin!" Jian Dao Sheng preemptively provided the answer, not giving Li Fan a chance to ponder independently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong's eyes showed pride, "Historically, most Star Sea anomalies have been recorded by our Immortal Boat, and we have basic methods to deal with them. Now that the Star Sea is merely recovering from destruction and has not yet reached a stage of rebirth or mutation, the possibility of new Star Sea anomalies emerging..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is slim."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if there is a small chance of new anomalies appearing, they are likely related to the residual True Immortal power pervading the void. With True Immortal scripts in hand, overcoming such storms should be no problem."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Immortal Boat elders were all very confident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The atmosphere in the hall quieted for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, Zhong Daogong spoke again in a deep voice, "Of course, to prevent the worst-case scenario, when we perform the Universal Divine Technique, we will leave the Profound Immortal Boat and only take some necessary supplies."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if our plan fails, it will be enough to preserve the Immortal Boat. With the seeds we leave behind, the Immortal Boat can continue to exist for another hundred or thousand years."</p>
<p class="calibre2">...</p>
<p class="calibre2">As it seemed, although the Profound Immortal Boat's plan to balance the Star Sea appeared reckless, in reality, the Immortal Boat had meticulously considered all aspects.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If successful, they would 'command half the Star Sea's power,' and even with dangers lurking beyond the high wall, they would have a place to reside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they failed, they would not lose everything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to their previous strategy of attempting to ram the high wall with the entire Immortal Boat's strength, this was vastly superior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And this was the change the "Tai Jia Divine Technique" taught by Li Fan had brought to the Immortal Boat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had to be said that the Immortal Boat elders were indeed not obstinate beings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were able to perfectly accept new knowledge and even apply it quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Then, when do we act?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Since we can balance the Star Sea's power, theoretically, the stronger the Star Sea recovers, the better, right?" Li Fan stated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he quickly negated his own judgment, "No, if the Star Sea becomes stronger, the power of its future retaliation will also be stronger. If we are too greedy, we might exceed the threshold we can bear..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong agreed, "Therefore, we must choose an optimal time."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Immortal Boat has already established a specialized organization. Elders will take turns continuously casting the Tai Jia Divine Technique to approach and observe the Star Sea consciousness."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"According to our predictions, the optimal time should arrive within thirty years."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"During this period, the Star Sea's power and the residual True Immortal power will mutually influence and restrain each other, forming a delicate balance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Any longer..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The power of True Immortals will likely dissipate into the Star Sea." Zhong Daogong arrived at the same conclusion as in his previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan was pleased, "Good. Regardless, my lifespan is now abundant, and I have enough time to wait."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What preparations do you need me to make?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan proactively offered his assistance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong pondered for a moment and offered some suggestions, "First, it would be best to try and see if we can increase the number of humans covered by the ritual..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan immediately frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hesitating for a while, he finally relaxed his expression, "Although it carries some risk, if we are careful, it should be possible. However, we cannot do it multiple times. If we do it, we must do it big, to avoid future regrets."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's words greatly pleased Zhong Daogong, "The number of ritual offerings is crucial. Every doubling of the quantity increases our chance of success by another ten percent. We will have to trouble you to focus on this aspect."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Agreed." Li Fan accepted, his expression solemn, as if contemplating how to achieve this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As for the second point..." Zhong Daogong paused, "You can do it incidentally. If it works, that's great; if not, it won't have a significant impact anyway. It's just a backup plan."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan asked, "Oh? Elder Zhong, please elaborate."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The key to the ritual's success is to fake a cultivation world within the Star Sea," Zhong Daogong explained to Li Fan using simulated projections.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As you know, all worlds in the Star Sea have been shattered. Apart from your Da Qi..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, Da Qi's strength is not inferior to our Immortal Boat. Occupying it to use as a ready-made disguise would inevitably lead to a great war. It would be unwise."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Therefore, using the remains of destroyed worlds for disguise is a viable alternative method."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Within the Great Wall of Remaining Realms, fragments of past worlds are all interconnected, and touching one affects all others. Taking them is not easy. However, we don't actually need world remnants; we only need to obtain some imprints left after the destruction of the Heavenly Dao..." Zhong Daogong pointed towards the distant Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Hmm?" Li Fan appeared somewhat confused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What are these 'imprints of a destroyed Heavenly Dao'?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong extended his hand and produced an object.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It resembled amber, yet also like white jade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was formed naturally, without any carving marks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was shaped like a wooden umbrella.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is the only remnant of a cultivation world after its destruction. Our Immortal Boat obtained it in the void after a Star Sea anomaly subsided."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If you search carefully, you will surely find many similar objects within the Great Wall of Remaining Realms. Your escape technique is divine; searching should be much easier for you."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zhong Daogong quickly put away the wooden umbrella and white jade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, there is no need to force it. Within the Immortal Boat's secret collection, there are still some such Heavenly Dao imprints. They should be sufficient to complete the disguise."</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-366" class="calibre1">Chapter 1349: It's Indeed a Disturbance</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Collecting more is merely an added precaution."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The most crucial aspect is the number of offerings for the Universal Ritual..." Zhong Daogong's gaze was fervent, re-emphasizing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If you feel any pressure, you can also choose an elder to assist you." Li Fan pondered for a moment, then finally shook his head, "My Da Qi's World Protection Immortal Artifact supervises heaven and earth. If an outsider were to intrude, it would surely cause alarm, which would be counterproductive to the plan."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I am sufficient on my own! The optimal time window is within thirty years..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It won't take that long! If everything goes smoothly, I will succeed within three to five years." Li Fan was full of confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However..." Li Fan suddenly frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your concerns are valid. Speak freely. If you require any assistance, just ask! All the elders will fully cooperate." Zhong Daogong, having received Li Fan's guarantee, was very generous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan nodded, "My purpose for venturing out this time is as a pretext to search for treasures in Star Sea ruins. If I return empty-handed, it might arouse suspicion. I need to select something from the Immortal Boat's secret collection to bring back. Of course, something to satisfy them, from the first layer of the secret collection, will suffice." Seeing Dao Sheng heard this, he suddenly asked, "If the items brought back are of higher value, would that be more beneficial for the subsequent ritual preparation?" Li Fan subconsciously replied, "Naturally... However, to be honest, the help is indeed limited. Da Qi's academic circles are even more entrenched than our Immortal Boat Elder Council. A few treasures alone are far from enough. It still depends on time and hard-earned seniority." The elders exchanged glances, and finally, Zhong Daogong spoke, "Even a slight increase in certainty is beneficial. You can go to the second layer of the treasury to choose. Items stored there are of extremely high value but do not affect the survival and continuation of the Immortal Boat." Li Fan did not refuse and cupped his hands, "That would be for the best." Accompanied by everyone, Li Fan returned to the second layer of the Immortal Boat's secret collection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He surveyed the rare treasures sealed within the light spheres of the "Celestial Star Light Lotus." The Immortal Boat Elder Council agreed to let him choose two items from here, and then three from the first layer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With five treasures in hand, it would dispel Da Qi's doubts and also facilitate the smooth progress of the Universal Ritual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan browsed the items. In the second layer of the secret collection, he first chose a Yin-Yang Jade. It was condensed from a state of subtle balance between vast amounts of Yin and Yang energies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had a hunch that if he infused this Yin-Yang energy into the Xuanhuang sublimation process, it might yield unexpected results.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the second treasure he chose... it was naturally one of Sun Piaomiao's three遗物 (relics), the three-branched divine tree that resonated with "Returning to True"!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regarding Sun Piaomiao's relics, the Immortal Boat elders had all used the "Reveal" script to observe them. The broken-winged gray bird and the three-branched tree, unlike the Medicine King Cauldron, did not show any apparent connection to the outside world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ruling them out as potential gray chess pieces, the elders of the Immortal Boat deemed them to be mere decoys left by Sun Piaomiao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan explained, "Although this item has little practical value, it was also left by Sun Piaomiao. It originates from the same source as the hanging puppet that saved my life last time. My master would surely be very interested in it." The Immortal Boat elders hesitated for a moment, but ultimately agreed to Li Fan's request.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterward, Li Fan went to the first layer of the secret collection and took a piece of black star stone, a peculiar bronze mirror, and a liquid long sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only then did he bid farewell to the Immortal Boat. His sword shadow flashed, and he vanished into the dark Star Sea. After Li Fan left, the elders of the Immortal Boat gathered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Although he guaranteed it, we cannot place all our hopes solely on him," Zhong Daogong said solemnly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, we must also prepare other methods to mitigate the Star Sea's backlash."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it is time to open the third layer of the Hundred Wonders Immortal Record..." As soon as this was said, the hall fell into silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if the third layer of the secret collection contained something that greatly intimidated everyone. The elders' expressions varied, but for a long time, no one voiced their agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's wait a bit longer. Let's set a five-year deadline. Everyone think again if there are any better solutions."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If he succeeds within this period, that would be even better."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Otherwise..." A shadow flickered in Zhong Daogong's eyes as he looked toward the now-closed entrance to the Hundred Wonders Secret Collection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">... Far from the Immortal Boat, Li Fan did not return to the Xuanhuang Realm immediately. Instead, he headed towards the Great Wall of Remaining Realms, to where Yin Shangren and Bai Hua were located.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Along the way, Li Fan took out the three-branched tree. The anomaly of "Returning to True" appeared precisely at this moment. Li Fan suppressed the burgeoning craving in his heart temporarily and first examined the creation before him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This three-branched tree was crafted from an unknown material, neither copper nor wood, possessing the hardness and coolness of metal, yet also the vitality and ancient aura of an ancient tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On each branch, instead of leaves, grew another entirely new tree. And on these secondary branches, further three-branched growths emerged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Endlessly, as if without limit. Even with Li Fan's current divine sense constantly tracking and observing, he could not ascertain the total number of branches within a short time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"As expected, marvelous," Li Fan nodded slightly, then ceased suppressing his desire from "Returning to True." A mysterious force enveloped the three-branched tree, and the ancient creation, bathed in a soft light, gradually vanished into the air. Li Fan stared intently at the changes on the "Returning to True" panel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, after a long wait, the good fortune of "Returning to True's" energy charge increasing by 400% directly, as happened previously, did not occur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact... Li Fan found no tangible changes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it be that 'Returning to True' consumed it in vain?" Li Fan's thought flashed briefly. However, he quickly dismissed the idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Based on his understanding of "Returning to True," it was extremely picky about what it consumed. Each consumption would bring about a substantial change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time should be no exception. Li Fan abandoned observing the "Returning to True" panel and focused entirely on "Returning to True" itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He even halted his Void-Crossing Wooden Sword escape technique, standing silently in the void, as Li Fan meditated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After half a day, Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes: "Indeed, this time, the changes in 'Returning to True' are not directly reflected on the panel."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But..." Li Fan once again conjured a phantom of his wooden sword. To outsiders, it was indistinguishable, but only to Li Fan, the wielder of the divine ability, could he discern that this phantom escape technique was now superior to before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a short period, such significant progress had been made. This was entirely due to Li Fan's deepened comprehension of the "Transformation Between True and False."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It can help me comprehend the essence of 'Returning to True's' 'Transformation Between True and False'?" Li Fan was quite shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Transformation Between True and False was currently the highest-level power Li Fan had encountered in his continuous cycles of reincarnation. None other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's comprehension and utilization of it were extremely difficult. It relied entirely on his connection with "Returning to True," using the scenes of worlds de-materializing and re-materializing each time "Returning to True" was activated, and slowly comprehending through personal insight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were no shortcuts. But now, this relic of Sun Piaomiao, the three-branched tree, could actually aid in his enlightenment!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes, carefully contemplating how this incredible event had occurred. After a long while, Li Fan vaguely sensed: "The Dao of True and False is like the ultimate principle of heaven, high above."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Only when I activate 'Returning to True' each time, can I ascend to the heavens and closely observe its changes."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And absorbing this three-branched tree is..." Li Fan fell silent for a moment. Then, a brilliant light flashed in his eyes: "Without my participation, 'Returning to True' initiated a 'simulation'?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The creation and de-materialization of true and false worlds occurred in an instant, not even affecting the current world, but existing solely within 'Returning to True'!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"While no one in the world noticed, it achieved another transformation between true and false. Only I, through the inexplicable increase in my comprehension of the Transformation Between True and False, was fortunate enough to discover it..." Becoming the only wise person in the world, Li Fan felt no excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, an unprecedented weight settled upon him, to the extent that his plan to rendezvous with Yin Shangren and Bai Hua was temporarily set aside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'Returning to True'..." Li Fan chanted silently in his heart. The surroundings instantly darkened. It was a gloom more profound than the already pitch-black and desolate Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"'When True is taken as False, False also becomes True'," the seven bright characters appeared as usual. The ability of "Returning to True" remained unaffected and could be activated at any time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But for some unknown reason, Li Fan felt a persistent unease that refused to subside. In Li Fan's view, worldly matters could be divided into two categories.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One was that which the ability of "Returning to True" could cover. The other was that which could influence "Returning to True."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything in the Star Sea, even the high wall, True Immortals, and the cat treasure, belonged to the first category. As long as he possessed "Returning to True," Li Fan was confident he could eventually overcome them all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the latter... was beyond Li Fan's control. The ability to influence "Returning to True" meant that Li Fan's greatest trump card had lost its efficacy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although this time, it seemed to be beneficial without harm. Yet, the occurrence of an uncontrollable event was definitely a warning for Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Could future 'abnormalities' of "Returning to True," and its desire to consume, always be satisfied? What exactly did this consumption by "Returning to True" represent?</p>
<p class="calibre2">These were questions that Li Fan had to contemplate carefully. "Returning to True," as an supreme artifact that mysteriously awakened after Li Fan's transmigration, seemed intrinsically linked to his being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was definitely false to say he wasn't afraid of losing it one day. But his smooth journey through countless cycles of reincarnation, and even successfully establishing a foundation in the Xuanhuang Realm using a part of "Returning to True,"</p>
<p class="calibre2">had gradually made him forget his past anxieties and fears. Now, with the changes brought about by "Returning to True" after absorbing the three-branched divine tree, Li Fan was jolted awake once more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long while, Li Fan finally calmed down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"From the current perspective, it is not a bad thing for me."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But I must quickly figure out what exactly this three-branched tree is. Why did it cause 'Returning to True' to simulate the birth and death of a world without my participation?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What exactly happened in that fleeting moment of world destruction and rebirth?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"What is special about it that caused 'Returning to True' to undergo such a change?" Numerous questions flooded Li Fan's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Sun Piaomiao..." Li Fan was now convinced that this three-branched tree must also originate from the Immortal Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is even more valuable than the gray chess pieces."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But even Sun Piaomiao might not have understood its underlying secrets." Li Fan pondered how to study this three-branched tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He could not be sure if, in his next life, "Returning to True" would still have the desire to consume upon seeing the three-branched tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Based on past experience, "Returning to True" would not consume something it had already consumed. But perhaps this bizarre three-branched tree would be an exception.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then came the question: if the 'abnormality' of "Returning to True" occurred again in the next life, would Li Fan choose to let it consume again?</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the first time, the decisive Li Fan fell into prolonged hesitation. This indecisiveness persisted even after he found Yin Shangren and Bai Hua in the Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While cautiously continuing his thoughts, Li Fan activated his wooden sword phantom escape technique and hurried towards the two, who were struggling amidst the reverberating Star Power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The location they were currently in was a "node" within the Great Wall of Remaining Realms, which Yin Shangren had mentioned earlier, created to maintain its self-stability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reverberating Star Power here was like giant waves crashing against reefs, with violent energy fluctuations, rivaling even the foot of the high wall. At their current strength, exploring here was still quite challenging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"How is it? Any clues about Xu Ke?" Li Fan asked. Yin Shangren, after regulating the somewhat chaotic life and death energies within his body, responded, "We have basically confirmed that Xu Ke was indeed drawn into this place. We discovered the last marker he left behind. Although extremely faint, it matches our pre-arranged signal perfectly." Upon hearing this, Li Fan shifted some of his attention to survey their surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His vision suddenly shifted from a normal perspective to an ascended view. Li Fan unexpectedly discovered that this "node" was not a high platform within the Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, it was a depression! The continuous, majestic Great Wall abruptly fractured here. However, this fracture did not actually affect the connection of the Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if... some unseen force within this depression was sustaining the unbroken connection of the Great Wall of Remaining Realms!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Interesting," Li Fan's interest was finally piqued. The scope of this depression, in the actual Star Sea, was merely a small area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Barely enough for one person to stand independently. It was exceedingly difficult to drift into this spot amidst the fierce energy fluctuations, especially without any self-protection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps only Xu Ke, that destined person, could possess such luck." Li Fan thought this, his wooden sword phantom like a small boat on a river, heading towards the depression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The closer they got to the fractured section of the Great Wall of Remaining Realms, the stronger the external interference affecting the wooden sword phantom became. Light and shadow flickered erratically, as if it could shatter like a bubble at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan slightly frowned, concentrating his mind, and maintained the integrity of his escape technique. Boom! The moment the phantom left the normal region of the Great Wall of Remaining Realms and completely plunged into the fractured depression, it felt like a sudden fall from a ten-thousand-foot high cliff.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Under the intense impact, the wooden sword phantom nearly disintegrated!</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-367" class="calibre1">Chapter 1350: Fissures Span the Starry Sea</h1>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since Li Fan comprehended the Wooden Sword Phantom escape technique, this was the first time he had encountered a situation where his divine ability was so violently impacted by the external environment. He even had a premonition that if not for the fact that "Returning to True" had absorbed the three-branched tree earlier and his comprehension of the Transformation Between True and False had deepened slightly...</p>
<p class="calibre2">He would have at least suffered the consequence of his divine ability shattering and sustaining severe injuries from that sudden fall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, Li Fan had indeed made some progress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was precisely this slight improvement that allowed him to barely maintain the integrity of the wooden sword phantom and successfully enter the depression node within the Great Wall of Remaining Realms!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike the depression Li Fan had encountered before, which served as a reservoir for residual True Immortal power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon entering this place, one could distinctly perceive the difference compared to the outside world, caused by the violent changes in altitude.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was like a deep, bottomless chasm suddenly opening up in the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan and the others were currently falling to the bottom of the abyss, gazing up at the continuous line of the sky visible above.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the sky here was a deathly silent expanse of utter blackness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And this chasm depression...</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not retract his wooden sword phantom, continuing to use it to shield Yin Shangren and Bai Hua.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He himself flashed out of the phantom's protection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He began to sense his surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was still a realm of darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But this "darkness" was different from the desolate void outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was more akin to the arrival of a midsummer night, with vibrant life subtly woven within!</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The high wall's chasm node actually harbors such immense convergence of vitality?" Li Fan was inwardly astonished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon closer examination, he confirmed that this was not his imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's observation deepened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within the chasm depression, besides pure vitality, there seemed to be no life yet conceived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the actual scale of this place was not as limited as it appeared from a normal perspective. Instead, it seemed to extend endlessly outwards, as if it had no end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With no immediate danger, Li Fan finally retracted his divine ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren and Bai Hua looked around with expressions of astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The birth of vitality in this place clearly exceeded their cognitive abilities. Their spirits remained taut, fearing that unknown creatures might suddenly emerge from the surrounding darkness to attack them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan noticed their reactions and then became alerted. They did not seem as composed as himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps it was the first time they had experienced the phenomenon of "extreme difference in altitude," causing their minds to become unsettled and anxious as they left their ingrained region.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was akin to mortals who had lived their entire lives on plateau suddenly finding themselves at the edge of a cliff or in a deep mountain valley, without any self-protection. It was natural for their mental states to change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He calmed them with a deep voice and then led them to slowly explore the chasm depression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A profound silence reigned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pure vitality, like an underground river from the dawn of creation, flowed silently here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The vitality ascended, yet could not escape the deep chasm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It merely condensed and gathered in this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan keenly sensed that the vitality here had a significant difference from the vitality that nurtured life in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the Xuanhuang Realm possessed such an immense quantity of vitality, it would undoubtedly trigger various unimaginable changes. Mountains would rise from the ground, and trees would grow to the sky. Countless new species and life forms would surely be born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But here, vitality was merely vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It did not conform to the conditions for the birth and evolution of life, resembling a pool of stagnant water, giving a bizarre and unsettling feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it is due to the excessively low 'potential' of this place."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan couldn't help but think this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After leisurely exploring for more than half a day, the surrounding scenery showed no significant changes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan frowned, instructing Yin Shangren and Bai Hua to wait where they were.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He himself, wielding his wooden sword phantom, moved at high speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With his current escape speed, he could traverse the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea in less than a day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Li Fan was shocked to discover that this chasm was far vaster than he had imagined!</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he continued to advance, Li Fan even found that the chasm was like a labyrinth, gradually branching out in different directions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Initially, it was manageable, with only a few forks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But later, each branch led to dozens, even hundreds, of different passages.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eventually, even with his heaven-defying escape technique, Li Fan dared not venture further rashly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This chasm labyrinth was simply too immense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After exploring rapidly for three days, theoretically, this should have been enough time to cover the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, Li Fan still could not see the end of the chasm labyrinth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had no choice but to rely on his memory of the path taken to return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After explaining the situation to Yin Shangren and Bai Hua, both were profoundly shaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This peculiar chasm is definitely not just beneath the Great Wall of Remaining Realms."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps it's like an underground waterway, connecting to various parts of the Utmost Darkness Star Sea from all directions!" Yin Shangren began to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua nodded in agreement, "I can faintly sense the source of the vitality here. Apart from the countless ruins of destroyed worlds within the Great Wall of Remaining Realms, it also originates from every corner of the dormant Star Sea!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Like an underground river, drawing in every bit of newly generated vitality, converging here like trickling water."</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the high wall was the supreme existence that enclosed the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the chasm depression hidden beneath the high wall was the lowest point of the entire Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of the vitality that the Star Sea had recovered from its destruction, followed the ubiquitous underground fissures beneath the Star Sea, and finally converged here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was precisely because of the accumulation of the vast majority of the Star Sea's vitality over tens of thousands of years that the sheer volume of vitality here could make even Li Fan feel a sense of trepidation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This magnificent creation is by no means something mortals could achieve..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Could it be another work of a True Immortal? Like the high wall, intended to completely seal off the Star Sea's vitality?" Yin Shangren's expression shifted between shades of worry and contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Bai Hua, she had gradually emerged from her previous fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Master, may I extract some vitality from here?" she asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan's gaze flickered. After pondering for a moment, he replied, "If you only extract a small amount, without causing the vitality river to surge violently, there should be no danger."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But remember, do not be greedy. Take what you need and stop. Otherwise..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan surveyed the calmly flowing vitality, his expression solemn, "The quantity is too immense. Such power, when suddenly unleashed, although it is vitality, it can also kill!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua nodded, "I understand this. In fact, I don't need that much. Just enough to awaken the Ice-Sealed Glazed World..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua's tone was wistful as she transformed into her Glazed Golden Body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her radiant golden form, within its core, held a miniature world resembling ice carving and jade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Faintly, scenes of countless cultivators and sects, mountains and rivers from the past could be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Glazed... Flower blooms..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua softly chanted, and her golden form suddenly transformed into a thirty-two-petaled Glazed Golden Flower.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sacred and solemn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Glazed Golden Flower floated into the river of vitality without causing any splashes of energy scattering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It simply floated calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its thirty-two petals slowly unfurled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan saw wisps of vitality being drawn by these petals and channeled into the miniature world within the flower's core.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the immense vitality before them seemed extremely viscous, not easily extracted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With all thirty-two golden petals working in unison, only a drop or two of vitality became visible in the central miniature world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, even this meager amount of vitality was like manna from heaven to the miniature world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if a wilted flower had been watered anew, regaining its original vibrancy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All sorts of miraculous changes occurred within the miniature world, the Myriad Blooms Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua's face showed overwhelming joy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren was also momentarily captivated by this wondrous spectacle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, however, noticed that due to Bai Hua's extraction of vitality, a miniature vortex of immense vitality was slowly forming around her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The vortex was initially small, but it soon gained momentum for explosive expansion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if all the vitality in the chasm was rolling in, with a power like that of a heavenly descent, crushing and engulfing everything, commanding an awe that made even Li Fan look on with surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Enough!" Li Fan frowned and called out a reminder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua, being relatively clear-headed and not blinded by temporary gain,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although reluctant, she finally retracted the thirty-two-petaled Glazed Golden Flower.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without the outlet for extraction, the gradually roaring vitality river calmed down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, in the short term, the accumulated vitality did not dissipate and formed a rapid current in this area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surge of vitality's power caused Li Fan and the others within to feel as if their souls were about to be swept away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had no choice but to reinforce the protection of his wooden sword phantom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren, looking at the seemingly calm yet deceptively dangerous scene, suddenly realized, "I know where that contradictory and crisis-ridden feeling comes from! It's because flowing here is not just vitality alone. On the surface of the vitality, there is a layer of unknown power that absorbs vitality!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is this power that continuously draws vitality from all parts of the Star Sea and stores it here!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua, having returned to her normal form, nodded in agreement, "It is difficult to separate this power from pure vitality, so my absorption was so arduous. Strictly speaking, the 'vitality stripping power' itself is not of a very high caliber. Even I can separate it from vitality."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But..." Bai Hua's face showed a hint of fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Its quantity is simply too vast. Whatever vitality the chasm holds, there is that much vitality stripping power. We might be able to withstand a few waves of impact, but we absolutely cannot survive continuous scouring."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having said this, Bai Hua couldn't help but glance at Li Fan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She paused, "Perhaps, Saint Master, with your transcendent escape technique, you might be able to escape."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan did not respond.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, he reached out his hand, touching and sensing the surging vitality current around him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The erosion of the vitality stripping power was undeniable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hand that was struck instantly turned pale.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as if the flesh and blood had been drained, and the bones beneath were faintly visible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, this loss of vitality slowly began to spread to other parts of his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan decisively severed his arm, thus halting the further encroachment of the vitality stripping power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The severed hand fell into the river of vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without the protection of its original body, it rapidly dissolved and vanished like a wax figure under high heat,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Becoming part of the river of vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This power..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regrowing his arm, Li Fan moved it slightly, recalling the details he had perceived earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not a simple extraction of vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rather, it was an instantaneous scouring away of the very foundation upon which vitality depended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the skin is gone, how can the hair remain attached? Without the foundation, vitality had no support and was swept away by the current.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a profound and mysterious sensation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan could not yet comprehend what the 'foundation' of vitality was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he could clearly feel its loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Indeed, it defies imagination."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seems to have some similarities with the high wall?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan mused, "The so-called high wall is a restriction of supreme rules. There is no path forward, or rather, no 'forward'!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And the vitality stripping power in this chasm removes the foundation for life's sustenance."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The chasm depression, hidden beneath the normal Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like underground rivers, it permeated every corner of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its grand scale was evident, clearly only something that could be created by the beings who constructed the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps, just as Yin Shangren speculated, it was created to extract and seal the Star Sea's nascent vitality?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Li Fan soon felt a hint of doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, vitality was being extracted, but not completely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the immense vitality accumulated over tens of thousands of years in the chasm still lay quietly here!</p>
<p class="calibre2">While accessing the chasm was extremely difficult. Li Fan had traversed the Great Wall of Remaining Realms countless times without noticing the minuscule node entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was not absolutely impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were still possibilities for entering by sheer chance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For instance, during this time, Xu Ke was caught by the surging reverberating Star Power, accidentally entering this chasm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"If one truly wished to sever the Star Sea's vitality, with His ability to create the high wall and excavate the chasm, He could have directly extracted this vitality outside the high wall."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But He chose to leave it within the Star Sea instead..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan pondered, his expression becoming peculiar, "Either the creator of the chasm and the high wall are two different entities."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Or, it was intentional."</p>
<p class="calibre2">In Li Fan's vision, the entire Utmost Darkness Star Sea appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high wall loomed around the Star Sea, sealing it off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beneath the Star Sea, countless fissures crisscrossed, connecting channels, drawing and preserving the Star Sea's vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And at the fringe of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The supreme high wall and the lowest chasm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Converged together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"A marvel of the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"For the beings within the Star Sea, these are despair-inducing existences. However..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Perhaps this chasm is not."</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene in Li Fan's eyes shifted again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Star Sea is reviving from its destruction. However, for life to sprout anew is not a matter of a single day."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Especially with residual True Immortal power lingering for tens of thousands of years, it has not yet dispersed. Even if vitality re-emerges, it will only be quickly polluted by the residual True Immortal power. It's like a small amount of rain in a scorching desert during the day, quickly evaporating."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The vitality that emerges everywhere in the Star Sea is simply wasted and cannot truly give rise to life in the Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"But if all of it were to be gathered..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre2">White bones litter the ground beneath the horses' hooves; famous generals and beauties, Jianghu, divine weapons, and common folk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since ancient times, only white bones and yellow sand are seen in the fields!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Confucian scholars are trampled under iron hooves; Buddhas are swept away by long spears!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This humble Daoist Li Guan invites this world to face its death!</p>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">"It is like an underground reservoir in a desert, collecting all the seeping water over millions of years."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"When the day comes, and the opportune moment arrives, with torrential rain pouring down upon the desert, this underground reservoir will unleash the subterranean waters, sweeping across the entire desert. Coupled with the momentum of heaven and earth, it will transform the boundless sands into vast wetlands in an instant!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This is a method for transforming heaven and earth!" Li Fan's eyes flickered, as if trying to see through the secrets hidden beneath the tranquil river of vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, as he had speculated earlier, the creator of the river of vitality was undoubtedly an existence beyond the mortal realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His arrangements, especially, were clearly not achieved through formations, and thus were beyond Li Fan's current comprehension.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Bai Hua's extraction of vitality ceased, the surging currents gradually subsided, returning to a state of dormancy. Li Fan's observations yielded no results.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren and Bai Hua were similarly silent. When they truly faced this place, comparable to the high wall, and were unable to uncover its secrets despite employing various methods, the gap was almost despairing. The three stood silently on the river of vitality, speechless for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After an unknown period, Li Fan shook his head slightly, "In ancient times, there was the sigh of 'gazing at the ocean and sighing.' Today, seeing the river evokes despair."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The secrets here are beyond our current ability to explore. If Xu Ke is lost within, we can only hope for his good fortune." What was initially intended as a casual task to find Xu Ke had unexpectedly led to the discovery of a chasm system spanning the entire Star Sea beneath the Great Wall of Remaining Realms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the plan had to change. In reality, if Li Fan had continued exploring, relying on the recording function of the Dao Refining Stone and his wooden sword phantom escape technique, he might have eventually explored the entire Star Sea chasm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the focus of this life was the sublimation of the Xuanhuang Realm. The vitality contained within the Star Sea chasm was too immense. Even if some were extracted during the Xuanhuang sublimation, the already explored regions would still be more than sufficient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Saint Master, I intend to stay here for now," Bai Hua said, after some hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"This vitality is of great use for reviving the Myriad Blooms Realm. Although I can only extract a small amount each time, with sustained effort, within half a year, I can restore my homeland to its former vitality!" Li Fan stared at Bai Hua, his gaze seeming to penetrate her body and reach the miniature world at its core.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even if it is revived, your old friends might not all be able to return to life," Li Fan frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan could clearly see that the Myriad Blooms Realm and the beings within it had all been refined by Bai Hua into that golden, glazed state.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if the surging vitality could wash it clean and restore it from its glazed state, it was uncertain how many beings could withstand such a transformation during the process.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bai Hua's gaze remained firm, "It is about doing one's best and leaving the rest to fate! Previously, there was simply no method to revive the world. Now that a fortunate opportunity is before us, how can I turn a blind eye?" Seeing this, Li Fan did not object.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yin Shangren then spoke, "I, like Bai Hua, do not wish to leave in the short term." Li Fan raised his eyebrows, "Is this vitality also useful to you?" Yin Shangren shook his head, "No. It's just that near this river of vitality, I feel an immense sense of peace within my heart. Those residual world souls that occasionally surfaced in my consciousness have all fallen silent here..."</p>
<p class="calibre2">This reason left Li Fan speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, if you are idle, please also search for Xu Ke's whereabouts. If you find him, that's best. If not, do not force it; prioritize your own safety."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The Xuanhuang sublimation is a long-term plan. We are not in a hurry for this half-year period. You two shall remain here for now. I will return to pick you up in half a year," Li Fan instructed the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two cupped their hands and bid farewell to Li Fan. Li Fan then stepped forward, his wooden sword phantom reflecting around him. Moments later, a peculiar wave appeared around him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the Ascension Array! With the imposing aura of a cultivator ascending and climbing the heavenly gate, it made Yin Shangren and Bai Hua instinctively step back to avoid it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In front of them, Li Fan's actual position had not changed, but they could truly feel Li Fan moving further and further away, and higher and higher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan, standing within the phantom of his wooden sword, gradually became ethereal. Finally, he completely faded from their sight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Such a technique..." Yin Shangren exclaimed, mesmerized, "If Saint Master does not return to pick us up in half a year, then we might be trapped here forever." Bai Hua did not refute, only saying,</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, with vitality permeating this place, there is no need to worry about being trapped to death." She then continued to stare intently at the calm river of vitality, awaiting the next opportunity to absorb.</p>
<p class="calibre2">... The Great Wall of Remaining Realms. Outside the node leading to the chasm depression. Without any warning, Li Fan's figure suddenly reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he returned to the Star Sea, he deactivated the Ascension Array and used his wooden sword phantom escape technique to leave the vicinity of the node.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In just a few breaths, returning from the lowest depression to the normal altitude of the Star Sea. The rapid change in altitude from low to high in such a short period caused his body and soul to feel as if they had undergone some violent impact.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pfft, pfft... Blood splattered, and his skin cracked. His soul felt as if it had been rolled over by thousands of massive stones, compressed and crushed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with Li Fan's foundation, his face turned pale in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The previous action was akin to half an ascension. Except, it was ascending from a lower-tiered world to the current Star Sea."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The impact experienced was already so intense. One can only imagine the trials that true ascension would entail."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Without the protection of immortal spiritual energy, ordinary cultivators would likely have no chance of survival." Li Fan's thoughts drifted leisurely for a few breaths, and his injuries had already completely healed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He did not leave, instead gazing at the marvel beneath the high wall. The invisible high wall, the continuous Great Wall of Remaining Realms, and the bottomless chasm of the Star Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Intertwined, creating an illusionary and mysterious scene. Even with Li Fan's power nearing the pinnacle of the Star Sea,</p>
<p class="calibre2">In his eyes, this Star Sea was still filled with mysteries. Perhaps, as he grew stronger and encountered more, the mysteries in his heart would only increase.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until one day, when he broke through a certain limit, everything would be revealed. Li Fan took one last deep look at this Star Sea marvel, then drew his wooden sword phantom and flew towards the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Dealing with the Immortal Boat's ritual is not urgent for now. If it were completed too quickly, it might arouse suspicion."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, as the progress advances, it is also time to officially begin nurturing the next Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate of this life." The Xuanhuang sublimation plan required a vast amount of immortal spiritual energy, which could only be accessed by the successor who became the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The position of Great Heavenly Venerate still carried the constraints of the former Immortal Realm. The scene of Sun Tianci's untimely death in the previous life was still vivid. This clearly indicated that Li Fan would never put himself at risk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, in this life, there was no need to create another innate Dao-harmonizing Sun Tianci. His Dao transmission projection continuously preached in various mortal small worlds, and he had already identified a suitable candidate. Li Fan moved his figure and arrived in an unnamed mortal world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scale of this small world was insignificant, let alone compared to Da Qi or Da Li, it was even inferior to the Lingmu Realm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A mountain range composed of thirteen peaks constituted the entirety of the world. It was more like a small-scale grotto-heaven than a small world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, in such a mortal small world that even a Foundation Establishment cultivator might not pay attention to, Li Fan sensed the nascent birth of a faint world Heavenly Dao consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And within it, a boy whose temperament could be described as exceptionally pure and sincere. Perhaps due to the world's small size, the chances of humans giving birth to offspring were extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, the total human population was always maintained at a low level. To them, the resources in the mountains were almost inexhaustible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With so few people spread across thirteen peaks, they were all familiar with each other, thus rarely experiencing conflict. Most of their time each day was idle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Inevitably, some humans here developed curiosity about the world beyond the mountains. But just as beings in the Star Sea were confined within the high wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They could never leave the boundaries of their world in their entire lives. There was a small boy who, from the day he could walk, would often climb the highest peak in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Standing alone on the summit, he would gaze upon this small world. The thirteen-peak mountain range unfolded before his eyes. Afterward, he would lie on the ground and silently watch the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Li Fan had observed this young boy before. During his climbs and gazes, his mind was filled with various thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But when he lay down and faced the sky, his consciousness entered a state of near absolute blankness, his thoughts completely calmed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If Li Fan could not sense his life force, he would have almost thought he had passed away. It is known that for a living being to exist in the world and interact with its surroundings will inevitably lead to the formation of one's own thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a very few individuals, either by chance or extraordinary talent, could enter such a state of ignorant emptiness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this state, which cultivators sought but could rarely find, was the norm for this young boy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even... this thirteen-peak world was too small. Yet, by chance, it had given birth to its own Heavenly Dao consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among the extremely limited number of living beings, the boy's daily act of climbing to the summit and gazing at the sky naturally drew the attention of this world's Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this world's True Dao consciousness was also in an infant-like nascent state, merely approaching out of instinctual curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the boy's soul became like a blank piece of paper, slowly imprinting the approaching thirteen-peak world's Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The traces left by the world's Heavenly Dao in his soul did not affect the boy's inherent disposition. He continued his daily routine of climbing to the summit and gazing at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And without his awareness, the Heavenly Dao consciousness descended with increasing familiarity, leaving its imprint. ... Li Fan observed individuals and countless small worlds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had to admit that this was an unparalleled miracle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Like man, like heaven; heaven in reality is man. Unity of heaven and man, man surpasses heaven's marvels!"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Observing the Dao of Heaven, carrying out the Dao of Heaven, is complete!" This nameless young boy, inadvertently, achieved the perfect state that ancient cultivators recorded as their most cherished dream.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the world's scale was too small, and its Heavenly Dao's perfection was incomparable to the Xuanhuang Realm,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Undoubtedly, for Li Fan, this young boy was an absolutely perfect candidate for the Great Heavenly Venerate. The Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate was essentially a proxy for heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the Heavenly Dao operated normally, in certain critical moments, the Great Heavenly Venerate would intervene and regulate. For Li Fan, he merely needed a puppet to open the legacy of the former Great Heavenly Venerate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The less autonomous the puppet, the better. However, if it were merely an unthinking puppet, it would be impossible to pass the succession trial.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The appearance of this young boy perfectly solved Li Fan's problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"In his current state, after becoming the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, he will not make any independent decisions. He will fully adhere to the original operation method of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, governing through non-action."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"And for the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, a Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate who does nothing is precisely what it would welcome. His compatibility might not be inferior to Mr. Bai's..." The more Li Fan looked at this young boy, the more satisfied he became.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a flick of his finger, a small amount of light and shadow subtly entered the boy's pure and flawless blank consciousness. It did not even disturb the approaching Heavenly Dao consciousness of this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, Li Fan did not directly implant the details of the Great Heavenly Venerate's Tribulation Realm trial. Only subtle hints and guidance for critical decision points.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The boy's thoughts were too simple. With these guides, he should be able to pass the trial through instinctive choices.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"The future Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate must have a name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"From now on, your name will be [Nameless]." To preserve Nameless's innocence, Li Fan did not even implant his own existence into his sea of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Entering the Tribulation Realm through the Thirteen Peaks, succeeding as the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, and later detonating the immortal artifact to infuse the Xuanhuang Realm with immortal spiritual energy to promote its sublimation, leading to the birth of the first Heavenly Immortal Soul... all depended on silent guidance and subtle suggestions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This meant that Li Fan would have to cooperate with Nameless in the 'Dao Harmonization Plan.' However, Nameless's nature of 'non-action and non-governance' would minimize uncontrollability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"For a considerable period, Nameless's existence will be almost negligible."</p>
<p class="calibre2">"However, if in this life, after I attain Dao Harmonization, the Xuanhuang Realm still exists..." Li Fan's eyes gleamed with curiosity. "With the passage of time, my body merging with the Heavenly Dao consciousness of the 'Super Xuanhuang Realm,' perhaps Nameless could achieve a level comparable to a True Immortal through this opportunity!" It was foreseeable that the Xuanhuang Realm, driven by Li Fan's methods in this life, would almost ascend to an Immortal Domain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And to merge with the Heavenly Dao consciousness of an Immortal Domain... perhaps even former True Immortals could not achieve this! At that time, his strength would surely surpass that of the Immortal Boat's Star Sea balancing consciousness!</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the time required would be exceedingly long. Only someone like Nameless, born under such fortuitous circumstances and possessing such purity, could achieve it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it were Li Fan, he would not be able to endure for long before his true consciousness would inevitably clash with the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, Li Fan had abandoned the idea of replacing it from the outset.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"I just don't know, when the Xuanhuang Realm ascends to become an Immortal Domain, what changes will occur in the position of the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate?"</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Will the restrictions left by the former Immortal Realm disappear, or will they intensify?"</p>
