<h1>Chapter 721: Diversionary Tactic</h1><p>After escaping the Black-armored Guard's sight and continuing an unhurried flight for some time, Qin Sang paused, certain he wasn't being followed.</p><p>He turned towards Winterflame Island, hesitation evident on his face.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he scanned his surroundings, landed on a nearby islet, and set up a concealed spirit formation, hiding himself on the island.</p><p>An idea had suddenly sprung to mind, but he wasn't sure if it was feasible.</p><p>He deployed the Ten Yama Banners, summoning the Nine Nether Devilfire.</p><p>The Devilfire coalesced into a ball, which Qin Sang beckoned to his palm.  Staring at the flames, sensing the aura they emanated, he fell into deep thought.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the power displayed by the Nine Nether Devilfire was only equivalent to a mid-grade magical treasure, a far cry from the Winterflame.</p><p>Even a small wisp of Winterflame was more formidable than the Devilfire.</p><p>However, this wasn't the true form of the Nine Nether Devilfire. Its essence was sealed within the Ten Yama Banners, suppressed by the banner poles forged from Blackiron. The power it displayed was merely the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Neither Qin Sang nor the former Grand Patriarch Kuiyin could manipulate the Devilfire without the banners.</p><p>The Blackiron was enigmatic, its restrictions profound, inspiring awe in the Devilfire.</p><p>With the rapid advancement of his refining skills, Qin Sang's understanding of the Blackiron deepened. He had once considered using it to craft other magical treasures, but now he dared not entertain the thought.</p><p>Daoist Jiupao had attempted to forge his natal treasure using the Blackiron. The insights he left behind were nothing more than wishful thinking. Had Daoist Jiupao not been killed and successfully taken over a new body, had he had the opportunity to attempt it, he would have surely tasted the bitter fruit of failure, wasting high-grade spirit stones in vain.</p><p>The restrictions within the Blackiron were exceptionally intricate and perfectly integrated, impossible to reshape even for someone as powerful as Grand Patriarch Kuiyin.</p><p>It was only because the Blackiron was damaged for unknown reasons that a flaw was found, allowing it to be cleverly divided. This, however, didn't harm the treasure's essence.</p><p>Without the Blackiron, the Nine Nether Devilfire, like the Winterflame, would be untamable by anyone.</p><p>So, was there a hierarchy or ranking among different spiritual and demonic flames?</p><p>This thought constantly churned in Qin Sang's mind. Having encountered the Winterflame up close and comparing it to the Nine Nether Devilfire sealed within the Ten Yama Banners, he felt that the Nine Nether Devilfire should be stronger.</p><p>This could also be seen from Grand Patriarch Kuiyin and Cultivator Dongming.</p><p>Cultivator Dongming failed to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, while Grand Patriarch Kuiyin, with just a portion of the Nine Nether Devilfire's power, could exert his influence over the Small Cold Region using the Ten Yama Formation.</p><p>He naturally wouldn't dare to consider the undivided Winterflame.</p><p>The power of spiritual flames was also related to their quantity.</p><p>Compared to such a large mass of Winterflame, the Nine Nether Devilfire sealed within the three Ten Yama Banners was too little; it might even be devoured instead.</p><p>However, there might be a chance with the divided Winterflame.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation wasn't even worthy of carrying the shoes of the Heavenspan Island Master, but he possessed something Nascent Soul Patriarchs didn't.</p><p>Both being spiritual flames, could he use the Ten Yama Banners and the Nine Nether Devilfire to suppress the Winterflame's volatility and take it away?</p><p>Qin Sang knew little about heavenly spiritual flames, and this was just a conjecture.</p><p>If he could take away a wisp of Winterflame, even if he couldn't subdue it in the end, it could at least serve as a surprise attack, a means to eliminate enemies.</p><p>At the very least, late Core Formation cultivators would have no choice but to flee in the face of the Winterflame.</p><p>This risk was worth taking!</p><p>Even if he offended the Heavenspan Island Master and Old Devil Mu, he wasn't afraid. Both the inner and outer seas were vast and boundless. He was a lone wolf; at worst, he could hide for a while longer and be more discreet in the future.</p><p>What could they do to him?</p><p>Having reached this decision, Qin Sang resolved to give it a try.</p><p>The only obstacle was the Black-armored Guard. Retrieving the Winterflame would take time, and he needed to lure the guard away first.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently waited on the island for five whole days. On the sixth day, at noon, under the blazing sun, he quietly left the island to execute his plan of stealing the flame.</p><p>After leaving the island, Qin Sang released the Two-headed Vulture, concealing the Yang Ring, and whispered a few words.</p><p>After listening to Qin Sang's instructions, the Two-headed Vulture shook its heads rapidly, refusing to comply.</p><p>Qin Sang resorted to both threats and promises, finally persuading the Two-headed Vulture.</p><p>This plan would certainly fail if not for the Two-headed Vulture.</p><p>Exasperated, Qin Sang thought for a moment and said, "Help me steal the Winterflame, and I promise to give you your freedom once I break through to late Core Formation!"</p><p>The Two-headed Vulture raised its heads, staring at Qin Sang with suspicion.</p><p>"I swear on my heart demon... Is that enough?"</p><p>Protected by the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of heart demons, but he wouldn't deceive a demonic beast. Once he reached late Core Formation, the Two-headed Vulture wouldn't be of much use to him anymore; he could just find another one.</p><p>The Two-headed Vulture let out a low growl, seemingly warning Qin Sang not to break his promise. Then, it spread its wings and silently flew north. It would take a large arc and approach Winterflame Island from the rear to attract the Black-armored Guard's attention.</p><p>The Black-armored Guard was stationed there; any demonic beast activity would surely alert him.</p><p>The Two-headed Vulture's cultivation was only one level lower, and it possessed the life-saving Shadow Splitting technique. It didn't need to engage the guard in close combat; it should be able to create a diversion.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't predict how long the Two-headed Vulture would need and prepared himself for failure.</p><p>After releasing the Two-headed Vulture, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. He then activated the scroll, vanishing from his spot and silently approaching Winterflame Island.</p><p>He had already tested the range of the Black-armored Guard's perception and stopped just outside it, quietly submerging himself underwater, remaining motionless.</p><p>At the same time, he released the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly, concealed, continued to fly forward, acting as Qin Sang's scout.</p><p>The Black-armored Guard's cultivation was too high; Qin Sang didn't dare let the butterfly get too close. As long as it could observe the guard's movements, it would suffice.</p><p>Ripples appeared on the sea surface.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly perched quietly on a wave crest, rising and falling with the waves. Before long, gusts of sea wind blew in from the east, and the waves gradually grew larger, a common occurrence in the Demonic Sea.</p><p>The Black-armored Guard was alerted and emerged from the water.</p><p>Everything seemed normal around him. The guard frowned slightly, then suddenly his gaze fixed on a point in the eastern sky. A black spear flashed in his palm, which he then hurled with force.</p><p>The spear's shadow shot out like lightning, the sharp whistling sound barely audible before it arrived.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Under the impact of the spear's immense power, a staggering figure was forced out of the void, appearing rather disheveled.</p><p>It was the Two-headed Vulture. It steadied itself on the sea surface, baring its fangs at the Black-armored Guard and letting out a low growl, looking ferocious.</p><p>"Demonic beast!"</p><p>The Black-armored Guard's expression turned grave.</p><p>He didn't immediately attack the Two-headed Vulture. Instead, his other hand discreetly flipped, and a jade talisman, somewhat resembling a transmission talisman but with far more intricate runes, slid into his palm.</p><p>Holding the jade talisman face down, the Black-armored Guard locked his gaze onto the Two-headed Vulture while his peripheral vision meticulously scanned the surroundings, searching for traces of other demonic beasts.</p>
