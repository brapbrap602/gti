<h1>Chapter 1919: The Thunder Altar</h1><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and flew towards the depths of the secret realm.</p><p>The layout of the secret realm was simple. The entrance was a vast jungle.</p><p>Within the dense forest, the presence of demonic beasts was not uncommon, possibly descendants of the spirit beasts once reared by the Thunderclap Sect.</p><p>These demonic beasts weren't particularly powerful, but for the disciples entering the secret realm, they still posed a significant challenge.</p><p>Beyond the forest, mountain peaks soared.</p><p>Heavy clouds and mist shrouded the mountain range, lending it an air of mystery. Faintly visible were the silhouettes of pavilions and towers, all deserted and silent.</p><p>The clouds and mist were clearly manifestations of a formation's power.</p><p>These Cloud Mountains were the heart of the secret realm, and the focal point of contention for powers like the Five Radiance Gate.</p><p>Upon entering the secret realm, these disciples all rushed towards this location.</p><p>Within the forest, scenes of conflict unfolded continuously.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't pause to observe the battles. In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the edge of the Cloud Mountains. With a brief sense, he confirmed that these mountains were meticulously arranged, forming a spirit formation. There were traces of thunder techniques, but none matched those recorded in the Five Thunders Court Seal.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s view, this spirit formation wasn't particularly refined, likely something the Thunderclap Sect had devised themselves.</p><p>The boundless white mist couldn't obstruct Qin Sang's vision. He easily pinpointed the core area and vanished within.</p><p>He was alone in the mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on a mountain path, glanced around, and proceeded towards the summit on foot.</p><p>“Hurry up! There must be treasures up there!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird chirped excitedly.</p><p>“What’s the rush? No one’s competing with you.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly. The Vermilion Bird had high standards. There likely wasn't anything on the mountain that would catch its eye. It was simply bored from being confined for so long and was creating its own amusement.</p><p>As he walked, he looked around, his gaze occasionally sweeping over the surrounding peaks. He noticed the unusual mountain formations, seemingly concealing hidden secrets, and couldn't help but feel intrigued.</p><p>This trip might yield unexpected gains.</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang reached the summit.</p><p>The summit was barren, with only a stone pavilion containing a stone table and stools. Scattered on the table were strangely shaped pieces, belonging to some unknown game.</p><p>Besides this, there was nothing else.</p><p>Qin Sang passed through the pavilion and stood before the precipice. With a gentle tap of his foot, profound light erupted beneath him, revealing a rainbow bridge spanning the valley and connecting to a peak behind.</p><p>The peak, originally unremarkable, now shimmered with rainbow light. Amidst the seven-colored rosy clouds, a three-story jade pavilion emerged.</p><p>The jade pavilion shimmered with radiant light, clearly extraordinary at a glance.</p><p>It was cleverly concealed. Without knowing the key, even a Nascent Soul cultivator would struggle to find it.</p><p>Qin Sang crossed the rainbow bridge and arrived before the jade pavilion, discovering it was perfectly preserved, without any signs of damage.</p><p>A restriction sealed the door. With a wave of his hand, Qin Sang dispelled it and pushed the door open.</p><p>Inside, a meditation cushion and an incense burner met his eyes. The burner was empty, making it seem like a place for solitary cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and ascended to the second floor, where he found three rows of jade shelves. On the shelves were orbs of light, mostly containing jade slips, bamboo scrolls, and scriptures.</p><p>He quickly browsed the contents of these orbs. As expected, they contained various cultivation techniques and secret arts, quite diverse, but unrelated to thunder techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang surmised that they were likely techniques from other sects, collected by the Thunderclap Sect over the years and stored here.</p><p>Besides the scriptures, there were some magical treasures and spirit materials of some value. Vermilion Bird’s eyes lit up as it swept them all away.</p><p>Continuing to the third floor, Qin Sang finally found what he sought: the true inheritance of the Thunderclap Sect!</p><p>Picking up the jade slip containing the fundamental Grand Technique of the Thunderclap Sect, Qin Sang's heart stirred. Within was the "Six Waves Thunder Scripture."</p><p>Although this scripture wasn't included in the Five Thunders Court Seal, it was mentioned.</p><p>Few powers likely surpassed the Daoist Thunder Division in their understanding of thunder techniques.</p><p>Even within Daoism, there were differing views on thunder techniques, leading to various classifications. The Six Waves Thunder belonged to the Thirty-Six Thunders and was considered a type of Water Thunder, a crucial part of the Penglai Water Authority's inheritance.</p><p>The Penglai Water Authority, on par with the Five Thunders Court, belonged to the Thunder Jade Mansion.</p><p>This scripture alone proved that the Thunderclap Sect had definitely received the orthodox inheritance of the Daoist Thunder Division!</p><p>However, the "Six Waves Thunder Scripture" was incomplete.</p><p>The sections from Qi Refining to Nascent Soul were complete, but the part beyond Nascent Soul was fragmented. The latter half of the jade slip contained notes.</p><p>The ancestors of the Thunderclap Sect attempted to deduce the missing parts, appending their thoughts and speculations for future generations to reference.</p><p>There were a few other thunder techniques, but none were as profound as the "Six Waves Thunder Scripture."</p><p>Besides the scriptures, the most important aspect of the Thunderclap Sect’s inheritance was their various thunder talismans, all bearing the mark of the Daoist Thunder Division.</p><p>Among them, there were only a few Tier 3 talismans, all relatively simple ones.</p><p>From this, Qin Sang could deduce that the level of inheritance the Thunderclap Sect received wasn't high.</p><p>However, what they received might not be the entirety.</p><p>The preface of the "Six Waves Thunder Scripture" recorded how the ancestor of the Thunderclap Sect obtained it.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense detached from the jade slip, looking down towards the ground, 'seeing' into the earth below.</p><p>No wonder he felt the surrounding mountain formations were peculiar. The scripture was obtained from within this mountain!</p><p>His divine sense penetrated the rock and layers of restrictions, sensing a stone grotto within the mountain.  He also felt resistance and hesitated.</p><p>The grotto was sealed by restrictions. Although meticulously set by the Thunderclap Sect, it wouldn’t be difficult for Qin Sang to break.</p><p>If the grotto contained what Qin Sang suspected, exploring it wouldn't be a quick task.</p><p>However, the grotto’s restrictions were integrated with the entire secret realm’s energy. The secret realm was already extremely fragile, and any significant action could cause it to collapse. It couldn't withstand much disturbance.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang didn't break into the grotto directly. He placed the scriptures back in their original place, merely erasing the records about their origin.</p><p>Exiting the jade pavilion, Qin Sang tapped a few points in the void, asked Vermilion Bird for a piece of the recently acquired Red Wind Copper, kneaded it a few times, transforming it into a golden copper slip, and casually tossed it away.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the secret realm.</p><p>Casualties were gradually increasing.</p><p>The youth Qin Sang encountered earlier had now replaced his white robe with a leather armor crafted from demonic beast hide.</p><p>The armor's original owner was injured by an enemy.  Although he managed to shake off his pursuer, his wounds worsened, and he perished on the run.  The youth stumbled upon his body, a stroke of luck.</p><p>Though damaged, the leather armor provided far better protection than his robe.</p><p>Killing his first opponent had emboldened him. He no longer panicked when encountering enemies.</p><p>Now, the youth carefully navigated the forest, alert and vigilant.  He clutched a yellow talisman in his palm, ready to respond methodically even if enemies suddenly appeared.</p><p>Confirming the surroundings were clear, the youth scrambled up a tree like a monkey and cautiously peered towards the depths of the jungle.</p><p>The outer areas had been thoroughly looted. He had to venture towards the core of the secret realm.</p><p>The youth knew full well that without valuable information, with his cultivation, finding treasures in the secret realm was a pipe dream.  That area was the stage for the elite disciples of the major sects.</p><p>The major sects only allowed rogue cultivators in to appease public opinion.</p><p>Some entered the secret realm to hone their combat skills, others to kill and plunder, accumulating resources. He was neither.</p><p>Ahead, clouds and mist swirled, the shadowy mountain silhouettes like devouring spirits.</p><p>The youth gritted his teeth and pressed onward.</p><p>The further he went, the more experts he encountered, making him even more cautious.</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderclap echoed from ahead, shaking the trees, accompanied by shouts.</p><p>The youth's heart tightened. He crouched in the undergrowth, not daring to move.</p><p>"Someone's fighting!"</p><p>Those who entered the secret realm were all descendants of the Thunderclap Sect, skilled in thunder techniques.</p><p>Such a powerful commotion indicated both sides were experts, locked in a stalemate.</p><p>“Could they…end up mutually destroying each other?”</p><p>The youth touched his leather armor, the thought flitting through his mind. He then shook his head fiercely, dismissing such wishful thinking, and carefully skirted the battlefield.</p><p>After winding his way through the terrain, the surrounding mist grew denser, and he finally approached the core of the secret realm.</p><p>Knowing nothing about this area, the youth could only choose a random direction. After traveling for a while, he was blocked by a mountain.</p><p>"The outer mountains must have been searched already."</p><p>Thinking this, the youth bypassed the mountain and continued inwards.</p><p>The clouds and mist obscured the sky and the sun.</p><p>The formations here could also disorient one's senses, leading to permanent loss if one wasn’t careful.</p><p>But the youth had no choice. He used a prepared secret technique to mark his direction. Feeling he was nearing his limit, he decisively stopped, looking at the mountain before him.</p><p>Reaching this point safely was considered good fortune. He hoped his luck would continue.</p><p>Thinking so, he followed the mountain path upwards. Halfway up, he encountered a restrictive formation blocking the way.</p><p>Fortunately, due to the secret realm’s weakened state, the formation was damaged. The youth, also knowledgeable in thunder techniques, managed to find a way through after some effort.</p><p>He encountered more formations further up, but found no treasures, making him anxious.</p><p>Finally, he discovered a stone hall on the cliff face. Just as he attempted to break the door, a sudden gust of wind erupted.</p><p>“No good!”</p><p>The youth was startled.  In his haste, he might have overlooked something.</p><p>Regret was too late.  The youth channeled all his spiritual power, but couldn't resist the wind, and was blown off the cliff uncontrollably.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The youth crashed heavily onto the ground, his entire body aching.</p><p>Fortunately, the wind vanished.  He climbed up, realizing he hadn’t fallen to the bottom, but landed on a large rock jutting out from the cliff.</p><p>The youth felt a sense of relief, thanking his lucky stars.  He sensed something eerie about this mountain and didn’t dare to linger, attempting to use his movement technique to descend and go elsewhere.</p><p>Before leaving, a glint of gold caught his eye.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The youth looked around, stretched out his hand, and a copper slip flew out from a crevice. "What’s this?"</p><p>He picked up the copper slip, his eyes widening in surprise. "This material… it’s the extremely precious Red Wind Copper!"</p><p>Looking closer, intricate lines were etched on the surface, resembling a map, vaguely familiar.</p><p>His divine sense swept over it, and the information imprinted directly into his mind!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The youth’s heart pounded, his face a mixture of disbelief. "Could this be… a map of the mountain range here?"</p><p>A particular location on the map stood out, marked with a route leading to it, accompanied by a cryptic diagram of a game board.</p><p>The youth found the game profound but incomprehensible, likely needing to reach that location to understand it.</p><p>His hands trembled as he held the copper slip. He abruptly looked up, his expression flickering.</p><p>If the slip was fake, he might get lost here.</p><p>But if it was real, it was a tremendous opportunity!</p><p>“Go?  Or not?”</p><p>Who would use Red Wind Copper to create a fake map?</p><p>Finally, the youth made up his mind. He flew down the mountain, following the path on the map, and continued deeper. He realized the surrounding mountain formations matched the map, his anxiety gradually easing.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the jade pavilion.</p><p>"He’s got some guts!"</p><p>Vermilion Bird yawned lazily.</p><p>“You lose,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“I didn’t make a bet with you!” Vermilion Bird squawked, hopping onto Little Five’s shoulder and burying itself in her fur to avoid admitting defeat.</p><p>…</p><p>Guided by the copper slip, the journey was smooth.</p><p>The youth finally reached the mountain marked on the slip and climbed to the summit, finding the game board and pieces in the stone pavilion.</p><p>He entered the pavilion, scrutinizing them, but couldn’t discern anything. After pondering, he arranged the pieces on the board according to the diagram on the copper slip.</p><p>The moment the pieces were in place, rainbow light flared, and the rainbow bridge materialized.</p><p>The youth stared blankly at the jade pavilion at the other end, trying to calm his excitement.  Just as he was about to step onto the bridge, the rainbow light intensified, and violent fluctuations emanated from the pavilion.</p><p>"What’s happening?"</p><p>The youth was at a loss.</p><p>The expanding rainbow light affected the entire secret realm.</p><p>To prevent any foul play, the sect masters of the Five Radiance Gate and other sects had locked their divine senses onto the secret realm, instantly aware of any disturbance.</p><p>At this moment, the sect masters, meditating before the stone walls, suddenly awoke, their expressions changing drastically. They stared intently at the entrance of the secret realm, then turned their gazes towards the depths of the mountains.</p><p>Rainbow light illuminated the sky there. The heavens had shifted!</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The sect masters soared into the sky, rushing towards the radiant light.  From afar, they saw the silhouettes of mountains amidst the light.</p><p>Unfamiliar forests had appeared amidst the familiar mountain range. The so-called secret realm was, in fact, a section of the mountain range sealed and hidden by formations and restrictions.</p><p>As the secret realm crumbled, mountain peaks collapsed, and the cultivators inside frantically fled.</p><p>The sect masters rushed into the secret realm, ignoring the collapsing peaks, heading straight for the source of the rainbow light.</p><p>Before the youth understood what was happening, several figures appeared before him, their gazes fixed on him and the copper slip in his hand.</p><p>"Se...Senior, I…"</p><p>Recognizing their faces, the youth was terrified and stammered.</p><p>The Five Radiance Gate Sect Master summoned the copper slip, his divine sense sweeping over it.  His eyes flashed brightly as he looked directly at the youth. "Where did you get this?"</p><p>The youth dared not hide anything and quickly recounted his experience.</p><p>The Barbarian Thunder Sect Master coughed lightly. "Would this young Daoist friend be willing to join our Barbarian Thunder Sect?"</p><p>The Golden River Mountain Sect Master also expressed interest.</p><p>The Five Radiance Gate Sect Master snorted. "Still scheming at a time like this!  Do you want to wait until the jade pavilion shatters and the treasures within are destroyed?"</p><p>Everyone looked at the jade pavilion.  Indeed, it was covered in cracks, on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>“If there are true inheritances of the Thunderclap Sect inside, we should study them together. Magical treasures are secondary.”</p><p>The Five Radiance Gate Sect Master glanced at the youth.  "This child’s contribution cannot be ignored. The sects can discuss this matter later."</p><p>The others exchanged glances.  "Agreed!"</p><p>…</p><p>While the outside world descended into chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang had already entered the stone grotto, taking advantage of the chaos to destroy its restrictions and set up his own spirit formation, sealing the grotto completely.</p><p>Seeing the scene within the grotto, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.</p><p>“As I suspected, it's a Thunder Altar!”</p><p>Daoist altars were incredibly important, used for transmitting inheritances, performing rituals, and cultivation.</p><p>There was actually a Thunder Division altar here, and it was definitely not a recent construction.</p><p>Could it be that this place was once a Daoist administrative center?</p>
