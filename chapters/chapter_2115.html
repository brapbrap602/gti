<h1>Chapter 2105: The Mirage Jade</h1><p>The two sat at a stone table outside the cave.  The rustling bamboo leaves created a relaxed atmosphere, but both knew the situation was incredibly tense.</p><p>"We should send the disciples chosen by each sect to the shelter," Qin Sang said, "only then can we fight with all our might."</p><p>It remained unclear what the Zhuyan tribe's attitude towards outsiders was. Min Zhuo's earlier unconcerned demeanor, showing no worry about them reporting the matter to the Zhuyan, only deepened Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>They needed to prepare for the worst. Qin Sang was even considering a deceptive strategy: outwardly showing strength, but avoiding contact with the Zhuyan tribe, quietly building the Thunder Altar, and waiting for them to come to them.</p><p>Perhaps they could hold out until the Altar was completed.</p><p>However, this would mean giving up the advantage. If Min Zhuo exaggerated and twisted the truth to the Zhuyan,  prejudicing them against them, the situation would become far more unfavorable.  Even with a completed Thunder Altar, they could only protect the Storm Realm; they couldn't actively attack and eliminate all enemies.  If the Zhuyan tribe were hostile, ordering the other powerful clans to besiege and harass them endlessly, forcing them into a desperate struggle, that was something Qin Sang wanted to avoid.</p><p>After much thought, he decided on a different approach.  For the Storm Realm to gain a foothold in the Mist Sea, they had to be open and aboveboard.</p><p>"This time, let Su Nu stay behind.  Friend, you and I will escort the disciples. On our return, we will visit the Zhuyan tribe.  That Yuan Miao is straightforward, and we have his token; we might as well contact him first," Qin Sang paused, "Just in case, friend, perhaps you could send a companion beast ahead. You needn't risk yourself."</p><p>"Thank you, Qin Xiong, for your consideration. However, in my opinion, given the Zhuyan tribe's nature, it's better if I go in person to show sincerity. Even if they have designs on us, they'd do so openly and wouldn't stoop to attacking me at this time."</p><p>Si Lu spoke with conviction.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. The Zhuyan tribe's reputation was well-earned; Si Lu's words held some truth.</p><p>Si Lu also had his own considerations. After witnessing Qin Sang's strength, he had been wanting to form an alliance with him, asking for Qin Sang's help to avenge himself against the Si You tribe, even seeing Qin Sang as his greatest hope.</p><p>The sooner he returned, the better.  The longer they waited, the more the enemy would consolidate their power. Unless he could reach the Saint Realm, a complete reversal would be impossible.</p><p>But Si Lu didn't have anything to offer Qin Sang. This was the best opportunity.</p><p>If he were afraid of death, how could he demonstrate his value?</p><p>Si Lu had never intentionally concealed his thoughts from Qin Sang, nor did he need to.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware, but pretended otherwise. Only today did he take the initiative to inquire about Si Lu's grievances.</p><p>"This is a serious matter, and although it concerns your privacy, I must ask: are you of royal or noble birth?"</p><p>A flicker of delight crossed Si Lu's eyes. Qin Sang had finally opened up.  "Qin Xiong, you must have heard something during your time in the Si You territory.  The Si You clan is structured around one Emperor and numerous Kings, although the Kings' power varies.  The Four Great Kingly Clans are the most prestigious, and I am from one of them – the Yan Shan Si family. My father was the previous Yan King!"</p><p>"The Si You royal family also bears the Si surname, doesn't it?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>When he passed through Si You territory earlier, he had made some inquiries. Combined with the fact that Si Lu was guarded by Xia Changshi, a powerful expert, he suspected Si Lu might be of royal blood.</p><p>Power struggles within the royal family are always a life-or-death affair – a truth universal across all races, even the Yi Ren.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't yet capable of interfering in the Si You royal family's affairs, so he had avoided probing Si Lu's secrets.</p><p>Si Lu nodded and explained.</p><p>"The Si surname in the Si You clan is divided into many branches, large and small, too numerous to count.  Therefore, the name of their territory is added to distinguish them. For example, our Yan Shan Si family, while the royal family was originally called the Xing Hu Si family.</p><p>"Legend says that in ancient times, all Si families originated from the same branch. There are even stories that the Si You clan itself originated from the first Si family head.</p><p>"But that's too long ago. One Si You person could create a branch, and generations passed down, weakening the blood ties between the Si families. There's no longer any feeling of shared kinship. Mutual hatred and implacable animosity are common.</p><p>"Besides the royal family, another of the great kingly clans also originally had the Si surname. However, for some reason, they later changed it to Si ."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, "So that's it." His hasty inquiries had indeed contained many inaccuracies.</p><p>"Who are your enemies?"</p><p>Si Lu's face contorted with hatred.  He hissed, "The Han Jiang Lu family – one of the Four Great Kingly Clans!"</p><p>Not the royal family!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, but he didn't relax. Si Lu, from one of the Four Great Kingly Clans, the son of a former king, protected by an expert comparable to a late-stage Refining Void cultivator, had fallen to this state.  The enemy's power was clearly formidable.</p><p>Hanjiang Lu family and Yanshan Si family were equally renowned.  Why were the Si family annihilated? Was there another power behind this, perhaps the Royal family?</p><p>Qin Sang pressed further, "In the One Emperor, Four Kings system, how do their strengths compare?"</p><p>"The Siyou clan maintains this structure because the Emperor's power isn't strong enough to dominate the four Kings.  The four families need to counterbalance each other to maintain the status quo.  During my father's reign, our Yanshan Si family and the Hanjiang Lu family were the strongest."</p><p>"However, the Hanjiang Lu family's greatest threat wasn't King Lu, but their Grand Protector!</p><p>"When my father was young, he travelled and befriended Xia Changshi, whom he had once helped.  In return, Xia Changshi stayed by my father's side as a retainer.</p><p>"This Grand Protector wasn't originally from the Lu family, but held an extremely high position.  It's said King Lu treated him with the respect due a teacher. He was the Lu family's strongest warrior.  Xia Changshi himself admitted he wasn't a match for him."</p><p>Silu didn't know much about the Grand Protector. In those days, he lacked the standing to even approach him, so he relayed all the information he knew.</p><p>Qin Sang was even more puzzled. The Lu family had a Grand Protector, while the Si family had Xia Changshi; their strength wasn't significantly different. Why such a crushing defeat?</p><p>He frowned, "Did the Siyou Royal family just stand by and watch your Yanshan Si family be destroyed?"</p><p>"The Lu family succeeded because, firstly, my father died, giving them an opportunity to strike.  Secondly, there's another hidden reason...</p><p>"On the day of my father's funeral, many Yanshan Si family experts attended the mourning ceremony. That night, several people were poisoned. The poison was incredibly potent and strange; even with Xia Changshi's cultivation, he couldn't force it out. He could only use a secret technique to suppress it at great cost.</p><p>"As the poison took effect, an alarm sounded. Lu family experts had somehow infiltrated our defenses. In the chaos, the Lu family stormed the mansion.</p><p>"Seeing the situation was hopeless, Xia Changshi managed to break out with me, many of my father's guards sacrificing themselves to buy us time.  We escaped to Kanzhou before losing our pursuers. But that poison was terrifying..."</p><p>Silu's eyes showed fear, "After we reached safety, Xia Changshi intended to heal, but the secret technique couldn't fully suppress the poison.  If we waited, he'd likely die. We had no choice but to seek an antidote, only to be spotted by officials from the Water Department. During our escape, Xia Changshi grew weaker, finally sacrificing himself to give me a chance to survive."</p><p>Recalling those events, Silu's face showed sorrow, his hatred deepening.</p><p>Qin Sang was equally astonished.</p><p>What kind of poison could a late-stage cultivator not suppress, resulting in such a devastating outcome?</p><p>Without the Poison Pearl, could he withstand this poison if his opponents still had it?</p><p>"Xia Changshi said it was a poison specifically designed to target the Siyou clan, attacking the spiritual apertures in the forehead and causing spiritual energy to deplete. Each time Xia Changshi used his interchanging technique or overused his companion beast's power, he would lose the beast; it was as if the poison swallowed it, and it could never recover. Xia Changshi did everything he could, but only managed to stop the poison from further consumption, leaving the surviving companion beast very weak."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's furrowed brow, Silu further explained.</p><p>"Our Siyou clan's records mention several similar poisons. They are deadly to us but might be ordinary substances, even superior elixirs, to others.</p><p>"These poisons have long disappeared from the world. We don't know where the Lu family obtained them, but they couldn't have gotten much.</p><p>"The characteristics of these poisons differ; poisoning isn't easy.  We suspect it was Yuntian Yuan liquid. This substance is colorless and odorless, taking effect only when ingested. It's invisible in water and hard to detect. If the Lu family planned this beforehand, they could easily have added it to the wine at a palace banquet."</p><p>"Hopefully, that's it,"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. If that's how they poisoned people, and they had the knowledge, they just need to be cautious, and they wouldn’t need to worry too much.</p><p>The safest bet is to prepare an antidote in advance.</p><p>Silu sighed, "Xia Changshi did discover some of the poison's characteristics, but hadn't found an antidote, only some rough ideas.  We'd need a master alchemist who's willing to dedicate themselves to the task."</p><p>The Siyou clan has master alchemists, but Silu dared not contact them.</p><p>It seems he can only be careful.</p><p>However, Yuntian Yuan liquid isn't a deadly poison to those outside the Siyou clan.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "What was the reaction of the Imperial family and the other princes when the Lu family of Hanjiang annexed your Si family of Yanshan?"</p><p>"Neither I nor Jihong have been able to find out what happened afterwards.  The Lu family's actions couldn't have escaped the notice of the Imperial court and the princes. They likely suppressed the news to avoid a major upheaval within the clan.  The lack of widespread conflict means that the Si family of Yanshan wasn't completely wiped out; otherwise, the Imperial court wouldn't have been able to control the ensuing panic. Some of my father's old retainers must have survived. Perhaps the Lu family and the Imperial court reached some sort of agreement…"</p><p>For years, Siliu has been considering all possibilities and planning his revenge.</p><p>Now the Lu family is powerful, the Yan King and Xia Changshi are dead, and the Si family of Yanshan is scattered.  The former retainers of the Yan King may not be willing to support him.</p><p>Times change, and so do people's minds.</p><p>"If that's the case, why did the Lu family dare to launch a surprise attack, only to fail in completely conquering you? Was it simply expansionism, or is there a long-standing feud between your two families?"</p><p>Qin Sang needed to understand the Lu family's motives to gauge their determination to eliminate the Si family.  He also needed to know how many experts they would send if Siliu's whereabouts were revealed.</p><p>Siliu did not hesitate. "That's only part of it. They also want to seize the Mirage Jade from me!"</p><p>With that, Siliu took an object from his sleeve – two pieces of jade joined together to form a ring about the size of a thumb ring.  Strangely, one half of the ring was solid jade, while the other half seemed hazy and ethereal, like a phantom reflection of the jade.</p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>Seeing Siliu's open display, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment before taking the ring and examining it closely.  He saw the half-real, half-illusory nature of the jade, but perceived no other magical properties.  It was clearly not a spiritual treasure, nor a genuine artifact.</p><p>"Brother Qin knows that our various tribes have sacred grounds where those stronger than Sacred Realm cultivators go to cultivate. However, you may not know of another crucial function of the sacred grounds.</p><p>"They contain opportunities left behind by the ancestors of each tribe. These grounds open periodically, and those within each tribe who are on the verge of breaking through to the Sacred Realm wait for that time to enter.  It's said that breakthrough is easier there.</p><p>"In addition, each tribe can send people into the sacred grounds at that time.  Those lucky enough might receive the ancestral opportunities.</p><p>"However, opportunities are always accompanied by danger, and these must be fought over. The sacred grounds are the largest battlefield between the Heavenly and Water Departments, and there are even conflicts within the Departments and between tribes. The casualties are countless, but those who come out safely will experience a significant increase in power.</p><p>"There are two requirements to enter the sacred grounds.</p><p>"First, the sacred grounds open during the Yuanqiao Sea City's appearance. Thus, one must have the qualification to enter the Yuanqiao Sea City – the cultivation must be at least Empty Realm Second Stage. Smaller, weaker tribes don't qualify.  But if a tribe produces an Empty Realm Second Stage cultivator, that cultivator can enter, and might become incredibly powerful.</p><p>"Second, a token is required, which is this Mirage Jade.</p><p>"The situation differs for each tribe, as does the allocation of the Mirage Jade tokens.  The tokens of the Siyou Tribe are all held by the Imperial family and the Four Great Clans."</p><p>Qin Sang played with the Mirage Jade in his hand, realizing the hidden secrets behind it.</p><p>He wondered what the alien sacred grounds were like, whether they were a pocket dimension. Since Sacred Realm and Ancestor Realm cultivators could cultivate there, it was certainly not an ordinary small world.</p><p>The competition within the sacred grounds also showed the painstaking efforts of the ancestors of the alien tribes. The alien tribes had been hiding in the Mist Sea, so they lacked threats and might eventually lose their vigilance and fighting spirit.</p><p>Of course, none of this concerned Qin Sang directly. The alien tribes would never allow an outsider like him to enter the sacred grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the Mirage Jade to Siliu.</p><p>Siliu hesitated, then said, "A Mirage Jade token allows the owner to bring one companion into the sacred grounds.  I don't know much about the sacred grounds, and I'm unsure if I can bring an outsider. If there is a precedent, I'm willing to go with Brother Qin."</p><p>He had considered this and decided that this might be the only thing in his possession that could sway Qin Sang. </p>
