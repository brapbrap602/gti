<h1>Chapter 1750: Degradation</h1><p>Finally, a Yuan Ying cultivator made a move!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped, his gaze fixed.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly had spotted this person earlier.  Uncertain about the prejudice of cultivators in this world, Qin Sang hadn't used even a fraction of his spiritual sense, relying solely on spiritual perception. The other party hadn't noticed him.</p><p>He did this because he didn't fully understand the methods of the Divine Path.</p><p>In his understanding, Bai Long Jun was revered by the people on both banks of this river, making this area akin to his territory.  He should have a way to control his territory and sense unusual fluctuations, but Qin Sang still didn’t know the extent of the other party's abilities.</p><p>From the shouts of the wolf demon and the female cultivator, it was clear that this Jiu Long Kingdom was merely a mortal nation under her rule, comparable to the former Great Sui Dynasty.  In a mortal nation, even a single city would have a City God or Water God equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator guarding it.  Further away, several other energy fluctuations were detected.</p><p>This was his first encounter with a magical battle in this world, and it involved a Yuan Ying cultivator.  It offered a glimpse into the overall strength of cultivators here, which must be considerable.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t surprised. This world's spiritual energy was far richer than that of the Storm World.  As long as the problem of chaotic spiritual energy was solved, cultivation would be much easier here.</p><p>Four pillars formed a prison.</p><p>Water and fire intertwined.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations from the Water-Fire Heavenly Prison, a serious expression appeared on Qin Sang’s face.</p><p>This heavenly prison had the ability to seal and suppress, exhibiting the aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator harnessing the power of heaven and earth.  An opponent trapped within would endure endless refinement by water and fire.</p><p>If one relied solely on their physical body to resist, breaking free would be no easy feat.</p><p>Of course, this was assuming the opponent could capture him.</p><p>He recalled the dark ray that preceded the prison’s creation. The Sky-Eye Butterfly had seen through its essence—a black talisman.</p><p>This wasn't an ordinary talisman made of paper; it was solidified magical power, yet different from what he'd seen from talisman cultivators before.</p><p>"Is this world one where the Divine Path and Talisman Path coexist?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, his gaze sweeping across the four pillars. He felt that the prison's power hadn't reached its peak.</p><p>Perhaps this cultivator didn't deem these wolf soldiers worthy of a major effort, or perhaps their power was insufficient.</p><p>As expected, the wolf soldiers fell into the Water-Fire Heavenly Prison, their momentum immediately waning. The celestial wolves, once capable of intercepting rivers and breaking mountains, were now surrounded by heavenly fire and icy air, trapped at the heart of the intertwined water and fire, enduring a double assault.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>The sound of chains reverberated repeatedly; it was no illusion.</p><p>From the east, heavenly fire shot out streaks of crimson light, while from the west, icy air solidified into white threads, all aimed at the celestial wolves.</p><p>The celestial wolf violently shook its head, spewing out black rays, shattering chains, but it was futile.</p><p>There were too many chains, endless in number.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A fiery rope shot out, easily piercing the wolf's belly, instantly connecting to an icy chain. Other chains then merged, quickly becoming thick, two-toned divine chains, incredibly strong.</p><p>Celestial wolves were manifestations of divine power; logically, they shouldn't be injured or bound by chains.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the celestial wolf leaped, yet couldn't break free from the chains.  With a continuous clanking, it was immobilized.</p><p>The giant wolf sensed danger and, ignoring the female cultivator, hurriedly commanded its troops to change formation.</p><p>The lesser demons were also filled with fear, particularly the foot soldiers, trembling.  They would have scattered if not for the wolf commanders’ presence.</p><p>However, the wolf soldiers, the giant wolf's personal guard, displayed ferociousness in their eyes. Their formation shifted abruptly, dividing into three units.  The central unit formed a circle, while the flanks moved fluidly in a complex pattern.</p><p>Each wolf soldier seemed to become a rune, the entire formation forming a talismanic array.</p><p>The female cultivator, previously in critical danger, felt the pressure ease. Looking up, she saw a vast expanse of azure water in the air, as if a river descended from heaven.</p><p>Misty waves rolled, and squads of water snake soldiers marched on the waves, strong and formidable.  On the altar at the center of their formation, a middle-aged Taoist priest in robes stood with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Beside him, two water snake demons stood, one male and one female, both with human heads and serpent bodies—two transformed demon kings!</p><p>The water snake demon kings’ eyes glowed with divine light, their killing intent palpable.  Their cultivation and bearing far surpassed the female cultivator's water snake demon generals.</p><p>“Master?”</p><p>The female cultivator rejoiced, quickly turning the altar.  Her troops, receiving orders, charged towards the heavenly prison.</p><p>The Water-Fire Heavenly Prison did not restrain her; she easily left it. The female cultivator flew to the middle-aged Taoist priest, her face filled with shame.  “Disciple acted rashly, disappointing Master.”</p><p>The master arrived so quickly to the rescue, surely he had been secretly watching over her, witnessing all her actions.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist stroked his beard, saying, "Let me subdue this demon first, then we shall talk."</p><p>The female Daoist hastily bowed and stood to one side, her heart pounding anxiously.</p><p>At this moment, a change occurred within the prison. The wolf soldiers, using some unknown formation, rapidly shrunk Tian Lang's body until it was the size of a human head.  Then, with a flash of light, it transformed into a white, luminous ball, like a white flame, and shot towards the Eastern Heavenly Fire.</p><p>The flame absorbed strands of the Heavenly Fire upon contact.</p><p>Immediately, the balance of water and fire within the Heavenly Prison was disrupted.  The four heavenly pillars trembled slightly, causing the mountains to shake, clearly indicating instability.</p><p>Seeing this, the female Daoist was shocked. Her master controlled a significant Daoist temple and possessed immeasurable cultivation.  How could a mere group of soldiers break the prison her master had erected!</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist remained unmoved. After a moment of contemplation, he said to the Water Snake Demon Kings flanking him, "Our cultivation is somewhat insufficient to maintain the Water and Fire Heavenly Prison."</p><p>The Demon Kings responded in unison, "The Water and Fire Heavenly Prison is a divine power cultivated at the Dong Xuan level.  That the Master was able to establish this prison is already exceptionally rare."</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist chuckled. "Have you two forgotten your own contributions?  Very well, let's rebuild the Water Prison."</p><p>The two demons nodded.  Their gaze swept across the soldiers. While the Water Snake soldiers remained still, a wisp of ethereal energy rose from each, floating towards the altar.  The spiritual energy coalesced into writing implements, inscribing a shimmering water talisman in mid-air.</p><p>Accompanying the talisman was an incantation:</p><p>"Nine myriads in the Dark Sea, within lies a stone city.</p><p>Evil spirits guard the gates, venomous dragons devour essence.</p><p>I command the Water God, to banish ghosts and spirits.</p><p>Dare to violate heavenly law, and be scattered and destroyed.</p><p>Quickly!"</p><p>The talisman fell gracefully, like a beam of water light, into the Heavenly Prison. Instantly, the ice melted, the flames extinguished, and the water reflected the sky's light, resembling a deep, unfathomable lake.</p><p>With the flames gone, the white flame lost its target, bobbing listlessly in the water, appearing quite disoriented.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist sneered, "The Dan Xiao Flame, merely having learned a little from the Dan Xiao Mansion, dares to cast spells before this Master!"</p><p>Before his words faded, a massive wave surged within the Water Prison, crashing against the Dan Xiao Flame.</p><p>With a ‘whoosh!’</p><p>The wave, possessing the force to crush mountains, struck. The Dan Xiao Flame flared brightly, a pillar of fire shooting towards the heavens, seemingly aiming to breach the Heavenly Prison.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Dan Xiao Flame was no match. The pillar of fire was shattered by the wave, its flames scattering, swept away by the residual force, soon disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The flame’s light dimmed, like a flickering candle in the wind. Another wave in the Water Prison completely extinguished it.</p><p>The dissipation of the flame revealed the wolf soldiers below.</p><p>The giant wolf breathed heavily, its eyes fixed on the middle-aged Daoist, fierce and menacing.</p><p>It did not beg for mercy.  While hunting down demons and ghosts could be excused as untamed savagery, seizing the Master’s altar and plotting to kill the Chief Dharma Master of the Tian Shu Academy, was unforgivable. The Daoist sect would never tolerate such actions. It therefore prepared another formation, conjuring another wolf phantom.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist, however, was not going to give it a chance.  Streams of white energy spontaneously appeared in the Water Prison, moving nimbly within. Upon closer inspection, these were white snakes, initially only a dozen or so, but in a moment they multiplied into countless numbers, forming a large net that suddenly descended.</p><p>The giant wolf’s demon formation was incomplete. The phantom wolf in the air, upon touching the net, was crushed as if burdened by a mountain, instantly shattering.</p><p>The wolf soldiers' formation faltered. The demons felt as if struck by a heavy hammer, falling to the side, screaming. The weaker ones even spat out blood.</p><p>The formation was in chaos. The giant wolf was too late to regroup. The surrounding white snakes seized the opportunity, easily binding the smaller demons into bundles and dragging them away without a trace.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, only three wolf generals and a few small demons remained.</p><p>Knowing its fate was sealed, the giant wolf howled in rage, charging towards the sky. Yet, how could it contend with the middle-aged Daoist? It could not even break through the white net, becoming ensnared layer upon layer.  Initially struggling, it soon fell still.</p><p>As for its remaining soldiers, all were subdued, none escaping.</p><p>A middle-aged Daoist priest, as if having done something insignificant, casually glanced at the Heavenly Prison, did nothing more, but looked towards the City God's troops downstream. With a flick of his hand, a golden ring shot out, directly landing in the palanquin within the troops, seizing a person and flying back.</p><p>The troops were in an uproar, but dared not make a sound, proceeding warily towards him.</p><p>The one seized by the golden ring was the City God.  Earlier, seeing the situation turn unfavorable, the City God had secretly fled, but unexpectedly, there was another expert behind the female priest, the master of the Grand Altar, so he quickly returned to the ranks.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist priest, however, had sharp eyes, and had already seen through the City God's actions.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist priest turned to his disciple, saying, "Do you know where you went wrong today?"</p><p>The female priest bowed her head, "I failed to ascertain the enemy's strength; I should not have been so overconfident."</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist priest shook his head slightly, "The troops were assigned by me and you were appointed to oversee a branch temple – it was rather hasty. Compared to your peers, you lacked experience."</p><p>Shame crept onto the female priest's face. She mumbled, "Disciple…"</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist priest interrupted her, speaking gently, "This demon is cunning and dared to plot against our Tian Shu Academy's cultivators.  Others might have fallen for the trick as well, so it's not your fault. Your mistake lies in that, as a temple master under our Daoist court's rule, you should make better use of divine power. Before moving troops, you should deploy talismans and summons!"</p><p>Pausing, the middle-aged Daoist priest said, hands clasped behind his back, "As the saying goes, nurture divine power for a thousand days, use it in a single moment!  The spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas all serve and attend to us; who could harm you?"</p><p>His voice carried authority. The City God kneeling on the altar trembled.</p><p>The female priest suddenly understood, respectfully bowing, "Disciple takes your instruction!"</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist priest nodded slightly, then looked down at the City God, his eyes cold, and rebuked, "Disobeying orders and deserting in battle; you deserve death!  Bring him away. Take his divine position and send him to the Yue City God's temple here, to await judgment!"</p><p>The City God's face turned ashen, and he collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Two water snake soldiers immediately stepped forward, bowed to the middle-aged Daoist priest, subdued the City God, removed his official hat and robe, carried him off, and vanished into the sky.</p><p>At that moment, the City God's troops arrived.  While some were human, most were demons, kneeling on the riverbank, all terrified.</p><p>They showed no negligence, so the middle-aged Daoist priest did not scold them, and said to the female priest, "The sacrificial day is approaching, crucial for cleansing the six celestial qi from the people’s bodies; we can’t leave these people without a City God. You are the master of this temple; you shall appoint the new City God."</p><p>The female priest bowed in agreement, her expression relaxed. She asked, "Master, how did you know that there were rogue demons here?"</p><p>She had received reports that demons in this area were being slaughtered and believing she could handle it, sent a report to the Grand Altar before rushing here.  The Grand Altar had various departments managing things; such a small matter wouldn't reach her master.</p><p>"Not long ago, when I visited the Imperial Censor in Jinglu, I happened to meet a Daoist friend from Danxiao Temple, who mentioned that a certain expert from Danxiao Temple had suddenly disappeared, suspecting a rebellion amongst his troops. Hearing this, I felt it was somewhat coincidental, so I came to investigate," the middle-aged Daoist explained.</p><p>Fear showed on the female priest’s face.</p><p>Then, the middle-aged Daoist priest gestured slightly, and the giant wolf's altar exploded with a bang, and the Danxiao banner inside flew into his hand as a stream of light.</p><p>He played with it for a while, then handed it to the female priest, "The expert from Danxiao Temple should still be in Jinglu; help me return this banner, and deliver it to him."</p><p>The female priest gratefully received it.  Her master's words ensured her merits, and this would allow her to forge a good relationship with that expert.  While Danxiao Temple wasn't as large as the Tian Shu or Bei Ji academies, it was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Receiving the banner, she recalled the demon soldiers imprisoned in the Water Prison, and glanced at it, "Master, why not eliminate these evils? What use are they?"</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist priest extended his right hand, then pressed it down. The four pillars of the Heavenly Prison trembled slightly, then turned into streams of light and flew upwards.</p><p>"Troops destroying an altar is common. But an expert's death, and demon soldiers daring to harm someone from my Tian Shu Academy, that needs clarification."</p><p>Before his words finished, four dragon pillars appeared on the altar, with chains extending from them, tightly binding the giant wolf and the demon soldiers beneath.</p><p>The giant wolf looked at the Daoist with listlessness.  The Water Prison was not merely imprisonment; it was already suffering greatly.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist priest glanced casually at the wolf demon, about to question it, when his expression changed, and he stared at the wolf, a slight “hmm?” escaping his lips.</p><p>"Master, what is it?" the female priest hurriedly asked.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist priest suddenly looked towards the distance, shaking his head. "I didn't expect it to be a pair of wolf and jackal demons. The jackal demon was the mastermind, and I was careless, letting it escape."</p><p>The female priest was startled. "What should we do?"</p><p>"It's alright," the middle-aged Daoist said calmly, "Wolves and jackals are linked; they can transfer cultivation to each other. I see that the true demon is the jackal, which has transferred its power into this wolf.  It must be greatly weakened, and having lost its altar, it poses no threat."</p><p>Soon, everyone left.</p><p>Before departing, the middle-aged Daoist priest glanced at Bai Long Ferry, a hint of doubt in his eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>Upstream of the river, in a mountain.</p><p>A jackal demon, fox-sized, was hiding, when it suddenly heard someone behind it say, "Friend, please wait."</p><p>(End)</p>
