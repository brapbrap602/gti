<h1>Chapter 763:  Intuition</h1><p>Chapter 763:  Intuition</p><p>Compared to the ebony sword, the double-headed [weapon] posed a greater threat.</p><p>There was no time to retrieve his natal spirit sword.</p><p>The young man's face darkened.  He acted decisively, urging his golden ring towards the double-headed [weapon].</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The golden ring moved horizontally, its momentum no less powerful than a storm, crashing into the wind blades.</p><p>A series of clangings echoed through the storm as countless wind blades shattered, unable to break through the golden ring's defense. A golden light, unstoppable, pierced through the storm.</p><p>After tearing through the storm, the golden ring swerved back.</p><p>The ebony sword had arrived. The young man was about to dodge to receive the golden ring when, unexpectedly, the ebony sword veered downwards, aiming straight for his wrist.</p><p>The young man instantly guessed Qin Sang's intention.  The jade bracelet was his only antidote treasure, and also the opponent's only point of breakthrough. He valued the bracelet immensely and had long been prepared for this, determined not to let his opponent succeed.</p><p>The young man's true energy surged, his armor emitting a divine light, firmly protecting the jade bracelet as he retreated.</p><p>The golden ring flew back rapidly, unable to catch up, humming, then suddenly unleashing a series of afterimages.</p><p>‘Swish…’</p><p>In the nick of time, the ebony sword was successively enveloped by the golden ring's afterimages.</p><p>‘Pop pop…’</p><p>A series of crisp explosions rang out as the golden ring afterimages were shattered by the ebony sword. The ebony sword's momentum was formidable, but it was clearly affected, its blade dimming.</p><p>More golden ring afterimages attacked. The ebony sword's speed decreased drastically, struggling fiercely, but like a fish in a cage, its movement slowed significantly.</p><p>At that moment, the ebony sword abruptly stopped, and then a plume of bloody light splashed out.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The smile that had just appeared on the young man's face froze. He stared blankly at the jade bracelet.</p><p>His protective aura was completely ineffective, easily pierced by the bloody light.</p><p>The jade bracelet, affected by the bloody light, rapidly lost its luster, becoming incredibly pale in an instant. The young man's protective blue light shield fluctuated violently before shattering.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>With a crisp sound, the jade bracelet broke in two, falling to the ground.</p><p>This jade bracelet, crafted from a rare and special spiritual material, was a specialized antidote artifact used to counteract the purple mist. It did not possess particularly powerful abilities.  Polluted by the bloody light, it was destroyed on the spot.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The jade bracelet hit the ground. The crisp sound resonated in the young man's heart like a thunderclap!</p><p>With his protective shield shattered, the purple mist surged in. The young man snapped back to reality, hastily mobilizing his true energy to resist the poisonous mist.</p><p>His face contorted, he glared fiercely at Qin Sang, murderous intent skyrocketing!</p><p>“You dare destroy my jade bracelet! You shall die!”</p><p>The young man's expression twisted as he roared furiously.</p><p>The jade bracelet was his most crucial possession. Without it, he could not survive in the Purple Mist Wasteland, constantly needing to withstand the poison's erosion; his strength had been drastically reduced.</p><p>If the jade bracelet weren't an artifact requiring constant activation, he might even have considered storing it in his dantian.</p><p>But he never imagined the existence of such a strange and vicious method as the bloody light, capable of directly attacking the artifact itself, rendering any protective aura useless.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ebony sword flew back.</p><p>Its task complete, Qin Sang retracted the ebony sword into his spirit, summoning the Ten Directions Yama Banner. Hearing the young man's roar, he scoffed, “This Daoist wants to see who will die today…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, Qin Sang's expression slightly changed. He suddenly launched the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>The ghost banners unfurled, forming an array, enveloping Qin Sang and the double-headed [weapon].</p><p>The next moment, a golden light suddenly shot towards them. If Qin Sang had been a moment slower, he would have been struck. The golden light targeted his sleeve.</p><p>The young man's intention was clear:  by killing the fat silkworm, they would return to the same conditions, facing the poison again.</p><p>Therefore, after losing his jade bracelet, his first reaction was not to flee, but to launch a full-scale attack on Qin Sang, seizing the only chance he had.</p><p>Qin Sang had used the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, Sword Qi Thunder Sound, and Sword Light Diversification, almost exhausting his full strength, to create the opportunity to destroy the jade bracelet, vowing not to repeat his mistakes.</p><p>He was highly alert, noticing the young man's movements and immediately taking shelter within the Ten Directions Yama Array.</p><p>The golden ring, with astonishing force, violently collided with the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>The ghost banners trembled violently.</p><p>In an instant, the surroundings felt like a nightmarish hellscape, chilling to the bone.  The Golden Ring and the Ten Directions Yama Banner, both mid-grade magic treasures, were locked in a stalemate.</p><p>The two-headed… creature's assistance subtly suppressed the Golden Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately noticed the young man's strength had noticeably weakened, clearly hampered by the poisonous mist.</p><p>This was his chance!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained calm as his hand seals changed rapidly. The Ten Directions Yama Banner vibrated, and the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire erupted from the banner, coalescing into a single stream that surged towards the Golden Ring.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire appeared, Qin Sang sensed a strange anomaly.</p><p>He had felt this anomaly only once before.</p><p>It was on Cold Flame Island, triggered by the cold mist emanating from the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>But this time, the sensation was far stronger, almost frantic.</p><p>And the source of the sensation was deep within the Purple Mist Wasteland!</p><p>This was unexpected.  Qin Sang hadn't anticipated the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire reacting here. Could some kind of spiritual flame be hidden deep within the Purple Mist Wasteland?</p><p>On Cold Flame Island, the sensation was caused by the naturally dispersing power of the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>Could the purple mist here be related to a spiritual flame?</p><p>A spiritual flame capable of triggering a reaction in the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire would be extraordinary, perhaps on par with the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>Cold Flame Island first attracted swarms of demonic beasts, then was successively occupied by a transformed demon and the Huntian Island master. Qin Sang had gone to great lengths to steal just a small piece.</p><p>Even a small piece, refined into a fire pearl, had become his strongest trump card.</p><p>Therefore, upon sensing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's anomaly, Qin Sang's heart ignited with excitement.</p><p>This time, the spiritual flame was hidden in the depths of the Purple Mist Wasteland, with no one to compete with him. If he could find it, he could at least refine several fire pearls; subduing it would be even better.</p><p>The Dongming Cold Flame was a force feared even by the Huntian Island master and the transformed demon!</p><p>His only concern was the unknown location and distance of the spiritual flame. If it were in the heart of the Purple Mist Wasteland, the toxins there would be incredibly potent—he wasn't sure if Fei Can could withstand it.</p><p>However, realizing this wasn't the time for such considerations, Qin Sang instantly dismissed his doubts, forcibly suppressing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's anomaly and urging it to counterattack the Golden Ring.</p><p>To deal with the young man, Qin Sang even used his only chance with the Blood-Soiled Divine Light.</p><p>Simply forcing the young man back wouldn't satisfy Qin Sang.</p><p>Since the young man had murderous intent, Qin Sang, not one for mercy, had no reason to let him escape.</p><p>The young man's attack, while seemingly fierce, wouldn't last long. The poisonous mist would become an ever-increasing threat.  If he couldn't quickly kill Qin Sang, his only choice would be to flee, escaping the poisonous mist's range as quickly as possible for any chance of survival.</p>
