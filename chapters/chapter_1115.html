<h1>Chapter 1107: Mount Pilgrimage</h1><p>“Have you ever had a master while cultivating here?” Qin Sang put away the letter, sized up Tan Yi’en, and asked.</p><p>Tan Yi’en, upon hearing this, realized something and, suppressing his excitement, said, “Junior was previously guided by my father.  Because of my mediocre aptitude, and fearing that joining other sects without a foundation would lead to me being sent to the battlefield as cannon fodder, I’ve been hiding in Yinshan Pass, cultivating alone…”</p><p>“Your talent is not bad; you might even have a chance to form a golden core. I am currently short-handed, would you be willing to follow me?”</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, saying calmly.</p><p>Firstly, as the words implied, Qin Sang had just returned to Xiaohan Region and lacked manpower to handle various matters. Since he had the idea of forming a force, taking on a few disciples was only natural. He had been observing Tan Yi’en; his character and talent were both good, and as the offspring of an old friend, he had no connections with other forces, his origins were clear, making him a usable person.</p><p>Secondly, Tan Yi’en was Tan Hao’s son. If Tan Hao were to return someday, they could meet directly.</p><p>“Junior would be overjoyed!”</p><p>Tan Yi’en was overjoyed and immediately kowtowed, “Disciple Tan Yi’en, greets Master Uncle Qin!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t proactively offer to take him as a disciple, so Tan Yi’en could only address him as Master Uncle. He wasn’t worried about this; his parents both held Master Uncle Qin in high regard, and with his father's connection, his Master Uncle wouldn't possibly mistreat him.</p><p>“Get up. I can’t stay in Yinshan Pass for too long. If you have anything else to do, deal with it quickly and leave with me.” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“Disciple obeys!”</p><p>Tan Yi’en, a decisive man himself, immediately cleaned up his mother's memorial tablet and other miscellaneous items in the cave dwelling, left a letter for his father explaining his experiences, sealed the cave dwelling, and followed Qin Sang.</p><p>Leaving Yinshan Pass, Qin Sang took Tan Yi’en west.</p><p>Tan Yi’en, while seemingly rough-and-ready, was actually meticulous. Although he didn’t know where Qin Sang was going, he silently followed without asking many questions.</p><p>Qin Sang was very satisfied and often gave him guidance on cultivation, making Tan Yi’en overjoyed.</p><p>After some travel,</p><p>they arrived at a scenic area.</p><p>Mountains and rivers stretched ahead, magnificent and boundless.</p><p>Clouds and mist shrouded the landscape, creating a myriad of sights.</p><p>The Taiyi Danzong mountain gate was located deep within the mountains!</p><p>This place was located in the northwesternmost part of the Righteous Path’s territory, west of Tianyao Hill and north of the Far North Icefield.  In autumn and winter, it presented a different kind of beauty.</p><p>Miles of snow, a world of ice and snow.</p><p>“Wait for me here, and digest what I’ve told you earlier; your cultivation should improve.”</p><p>Qin Sang left Tan Yi’en and flew towards Taiyi Danzong alone.</p><p>He was going to see Yunyouzi.</p><p>The Taiyi Danzong mountain gate was built on both banks of a large river, with surrounding lakes like stars, and rows of extraordinary peaks.</p><p>A scene of lakes and mountains.</p><p>After the great war in the cultivation world, Taiyi Danzong not only didn’t decline but instead prospered. Upon arriving, Qin Sang didn’t dare to be presumptuous, put on a cloak, descended to the riverbank, and walked up the mountain.</p><p>“I don’t know the senior’s dharma name, nor the purpose of your visit?”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t walked a few steps when he heard a whooshing sound.</p><p>A figure descended, revealing a young man in a Taiyi Danzong robe.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t hide his cultivation.</p><p>The young man’s tone was quite respectful.</p><p>“This Daoist is Qingfeng. I’ve come to visit an old friend, your sect’s Daoist Yunyouzi. Please ask the young friend to help inform him.” Qin Sang stopped and said calmly.</p><p>“Master Uncle Yun!”</p><p>The young man softly called out, clearly recognizing Yunyouzi.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.  The young man seemed to have just established his foundation; calling Yunyouzi Master Uncle showed that Yunyouzi was not only alive but had also already formed a golden core.</p><p>No wonder he hadn’t heard of Yunyouzi among the newly-advanced Nascent Souls in recent years.</p><p>Back then, Yunyouzi’s cultivation speed after resolving the hidden danger had shocked him.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought that after his rebirth, Yunyouzi would be the first to reach the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>“Senior, please wait…”</p><p>The young man hurried back to the mountain, and soon returned, bowing, “Reporting to senior, Master Uncle Yun is not currently at the sect. He left many years ago to travel…”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, “Is Li Yu Fu here?”</p><p>The young man shook his head again.</p><p>Qin Sang could only leave a letter and depart.</p><p>Picking up Tan Yi’en, Qin Sang changed course to the south, heading straight for Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang deliberately changed direction, passing through the Da Sui territory.</p><p>He did not enter the imperial capital.</p><p>The old friends he had in Da Sui had long turned to dust.</p><p>The only thing worth remembering was a single stele.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>Mount Pilgrimage.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared alone before the stele.</p><p>Time was relentless; this wordless stele remained, but it was now full of weathering.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the stele, silent for a long time.</p><p>He looked up at the heavens, recalling the boastful words he had spoken before her back then.</p><p>Thinking about it now, it was so naive.</p><p>Fortunately, he had stumbled along.</p><p>"Qi cultivation, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and then the Nascent Soul…"</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the tombstone, murmuring, "If one could reach this stage, they would be considered gods by ordinary people.  But that shouldn't be my end. Otherwise, how could I fulfill the grand promises I made?"</p><p>He poured wine for the deceased.</p><p>The chirping of insects gradually faded.</p><p>But suddenly, a commotion arose from the valley below.</p><p>Then, Tan Yi'en hurried over, "Master Uncle, there's a battle between mortal armies in the valley.  Both leaders are nobles.  There are also cultivators among them. I secretly investigated; they appear to be Qi cultivation-level loose cultivators, participating in mortal conflicts…"</p><p>"Cultivators?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, sighing, "No wonder I've encountered cultivators along the way.  With unrest in the cultivation world, all sorts of villains emerge, neglecting cultivation and wreaking havoc in the mortal realm.  It seems the Pure Yang Sect has truly declined; it can't even maintain order in its own territory."</p><p>Alas!</p><p>The Empress's glorious achievements lasted only a short time before being destroyed by these cultivators.</p><p>The Great Sui Dynasty crumbled, and chaos reigned.</p><p>Tan Yi'en nodded, "These loose cultivators have no hope of ascension, their lifespans are limited, and mortal wealth greatly appeals to them. My father once said that righteous sects used to restrict cultivators' influence on the mortal world. But under the pressure of the Abyss of Sin, everyone is only focused on their own problems, and it's difficult to manage other areas."</p><p>"That makes it easier for mortals to encounter cultivators."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the difficulties of his own pursuit of immortality, filled with emotion.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang said, "Go investigate the leaders of the mortal armies – their identities – and bring those loose cultivators here."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Tan Yi'en left to carry out his orders.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the unmarked tombstone for a moment, then took out several spiritual items and talismans from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>At midnight, a thick fog spontaneously appeared around the unmarked tombstone.</p><p>The fog enveloped the area, the ground trembled, and the tombstone sank into the earth, disappearing along with the fog, leaving the area empty.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't stay to guard the Sacred Mountain, so he concealed the Empress's tomb to prevent its destruction in the war.</p><p>One day, if he ascends, he wants to take a look from the heavens.</p>
