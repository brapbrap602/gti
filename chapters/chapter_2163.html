<h1>Chapter 2153: Master</h1><p>Receiving no response, Su Nu pushed open the door. The room was empty save for a wooden table upon which two items rested.  She approached and found a white, round pearl and a jade bottle.</p><p>Her divine sense brushed against the pearl, and it instantly dissolved.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes flickered. She stood silently, a thoughtful expression gradually forming on her face. Then, she turned to the jade bottle. Inside were several crimson-gold pills. Recognizing them as spirit pills that could rapidly enhance her cultivation, she was overjoyed and silently murmured, "Thank you, My Lord, for this gift!"</p><p>After storing the jade bottle, Su Nu meticulously searched the room again, but finding nothing else, she turned and walked out.</p><p>Outside the wooden hut, Su Nu waved her jade hand. The hut and all surrounding traces vanished without a trace.  She then quietly departed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and Yuan Miao had arrived at the location of the trade fair.</p><p>It was a narrow, elongated spirit island. A long river flowed through it from end to end, like a jade belt draped across the island. The water seemed inexhaustible, flowing perpetually.</p><p>Elegant pavilions lined both banks of the river. Some had arrived earlier than they had, strolling along the riverside's bluestone path.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was drawn to a particular individual.  Clad in snow-white robes, with dazzlingly fair skin and long white hair flowing behind him, this person walked with a slow, graceful gait, exuding an ethereal air.</p><p>Three peculiar spirit beasts followed in his wake.</p><p>Each beast had yellow fur and a fox-like appearance, though they were larger, akin to horses in size. Two horns adorned their backs, lending them a majestic appearance.  They followed closely behind the man with docile steps.</p><p>"Cheng Huang Beasts!" Yuan Miao whispered. "This person is a master from the White People's Nation."</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the White People’s Nation, one of the Celestial Tribes, but he was unfamiliar with the Cheng Huang Beasts.</p><p>All three spirit beasts were in the Transformation Stage, equivalent to the Nascent Soul Stage in humans. He wondered what made them special enough to draw Yuan Miao’s attention.</p><p>"Cheng Huang Beasts have long been known as auspicious beasts.  Cultivators who tame one and live with it day and night can absorb their essence for harmonization and refine their vital energy for replenishment, thus extending their lifespan. Of course, to gain a significant increase in lifespan requires careful nurturing.  Ancient legends speak of lifespan extensions of two thousand years.  While such legends might be exaggerated, they can at least add several decades," Yuan Miao explained.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. Lifespan was meaningless for Void Refinement cultivators, but their descendants, those who hadn’t reached Void Refinement, were still bound by its limits. Taming a Cheng Huang Beast offered a chance to defy fate.</p><p>Spirit medicines that could extend lifespan had always been highly sought after, and the Cheng Huang Beasts were naturally no exception.</p><p>"Because of this characteristic, everyone covets Cheng Huang Beasts, and they have become extremely rare in the world. It's said that the only remaining group in the entire East Sea is the one bred by the White People’s Nation. A Cheng Huang Beast only acknowledges one master in its lifetime, but the White People's Nation possesses a unique beast-taming method that allows a single Cheng Huang Beast to serve multiple masters. While the lifespan-extending effect is somewhat weakened, its value to clans and families is even greater."</p><p>A gleam appeared in Yuan Miao's eyes; he was clearly tempted.  He, too, had descendants.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart also stirred. He had many friends and juniors from the Storm Realm. Due to the thin spiritual energy and scarce resources of the lower realm, their cultivation had been hindered. Even with the later compensation from the Azure Spirit Energy, they had still lost too much time and lifespan.  He feared that most would be stuck at the Nascent Soul Stage.</p><p>It was a cruel reality.  In a few hundred or even a thousand years, they would either perish in heavenly tribulation or succumb to old age.  Those who could break through to the Void Refinement Stage would inevitably be few.</p><p>The cultivator from the White People’s Nation entered a pavilion with his three Cheng Huang Beasts.</p><p>Yuan Miao exclaimed joyfully, "He’s also participating in the trade fair! Let's go!"</p><p>They landed on the riverbank and walked towards the pavilion.  Just then, someone approached them.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>The man stopped and bowed to Qin Sang.  "This humble one is Yu Chang'en. Forgive my interruption, but may I inquire about your esteemed title?"</p><p>"This poor Daoist is surnamed Qin.  Fellow Daoist Yu is also human?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, studying the man.  Dressed in brocade robes with a jade belt around his waist, he exuded an air of wealth, resembling a mortal landowner rather than a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>He guessed why the other party had stopped him.  The Sea Market had just begun, and outsiders were not common.</p><p>"Indeed!" Yu Chang'en was overjoyed.  "I didn't expect to encounter a fellow Daoist so soon.  Fellow Daoist Qin, are you also from Xun Province?  Which immortal city is your Daoist Sanctuary located in?"</p><p>Qin Sang had learned that the foreign races and Xun Province, one of the eight Celestial Provinces, also had contact.  Xun Province was located northeast of the Great Zhou Dynasty, with the Mist Sea situated between the two provinces and the River of Misfortune.</p><p>"This poor Daoist came to the Mist Sea via Kan Province," Qin Sang said.  "I've always heard that Xun Province is vastly different from other places, with immortal cities built in the sky, hidden amongst the clouds and wind, not fixed in one location but drifting with the wind. When the wind is strong, they travel millions of miles a day.  It’s a pity I’ve never had the leisure to visit."</p><p>Yu Chang'en laughed heartily.  "It's nothing more than a land ravaged by fierce winds. We've long been weary of this drifting existence. It can’t compare to the blessed land of Kan Province.  Fellow Daoist Qin would surely be disappointed."</p><p>Meeting a fellow countryman in a foreign land created an unspoken sense of closeness. Yu Chang'en was also here to participate in the trade fair, and they entered the pavilion together.</p><p>After some conversation, Qin Sang learned that Yu Chang'en came from the Yu Family of Xun Province. The Yu Family were merchants in Xun Province, and he had come here seeking opportunities among the foreign races.</p><p>Of the Water and Heaven Tribes, the Water Tribe was closer to humans.  Yu Chang'en had befriended a master of a high-ranking Water Tribe clan and was invited to participate in the Yuan Qiao Sea Market.</p><p>However, after careful inquiries, Yu Chang'en discovered that the channels between Xun Province and the Water Tribe had long been divided among several major powers in Xun Province.  The Yu Family, not being among the top clans, found it difficult to get a share.</p><p>He came to the territory of the Heaven Tribe to see if there were any opportunities.  Hearing about the trade fair, he came to join in the fun, never expecting to encounter a fellow countryman.</p><p>Learning of Yu Chang'en’s intentions, Qin Sang’s heart stirred.</p><p>Building a Daoist Sanctuary wasn't a one-time effort.  How to ensure its stable development and growing prosperity was a question he had to consider.</p><p>The Storm Sea could still accommodate Qing Yang Sanctuary for now.  As the number of cultivators in Qing Yang Sanctuary increased and their cultivation progressed, when the sanctuary reached its limits, it would inevitably face many new problems.</p><p>Recently, the Five Thunders Academy had sent people to search throughout Qing Yang Sanctuary, finding some unique products of the Storm Realm that, with careful cultivation, could be exchanged with the foreign races for necessary cultivation resources.  But this could only slightly alleviate the issue.</p><p>Qing Yang Sanctuary was still too small.  Unable to invade the outside world and annex other forces to continuously strengthen itself, it could only seek other ways out.</p><p>Qin Sang’s first thought was trade. Their advantage was being a rare human force recognized by the Heaven Tribe, backed by the two high-ranking clans, Si You and Zhu Yan. He also wanted to establish connections through Ji Hong and the Jiao Jiao Tribe.</p><p>In preparation for the Sacred Ground journey, these ideas had been set aside and not yet implemented.</p><p>With Qing Yang Sanctuary’s current strength, it was difficult to grow significantly. It needed someone influential enough to handle all the connections. Qin Sang didn’t have the time, and Su Nu needed to cultivate in seclusion and couldn’t do this kind of work.</p><p>Once things stabilized, it would be simpler.  Daily affairs could be handled by the juniors, with a Void Refinement cultivator overseeing things and dealing with occasional difficult problems. Qin Sang could borrow someone from Si Lu.</p><p>Learning of Yu Chang'en’s intentions, Qin Sang realized this was an opportunity.  He could use the Yu Family to build a framework for Qing Yang Sanctuary’s trade network, then contact his old friends from Kan Province, and easily get things on track.</p><p>If Qing Yang Sanctuary could monopolize the trade between the foreign races and the two provinces of the Great Zhou, there would be no need to worry about cultivation resources.  In the future, it might even be able to support him, the Lord of Qing Yang Sanctuary.</p><p>Of course, to achieve this goal, Qing Yang Sanctuary alone wasn't enough. He wasn't the only one with this idea.  Surely, others were already working on it in secret.  For the small Qing Yang Sanctuary to grow and swallow this piece of fat meat, open and covert struggles were unavoidable.  It would be best to involve Zhu Yan, Si You, and Jiao Jiao.</p><p>With this idea in mind, Qin Sang spent the trade fair pondering various details, appearing somewhat distracted.</p><p>However, when the cultivator from the White People’s Nation offered the Cheng Huang Beasts for sale, Qin Sang spared no expense in acquiring one.</p><p>As the sun set in the west, the trade fair concluded.  Qin Sang invited Yu Chang'en to visit him another day, and Yu Chang'en readily agreed.</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling, Qin Sang entrusted the Cheng Huang Beast to Li Yufu and instructed him and Yu Nu to prepare for cooperation with the Yu Family.</p><p>…</p><p>Days passed.</p><p>More and more cultivators arrived at the Yuan Qiao Sea Market.  The Treasure Tree was laden with fruit, a vibrant red sight to behold.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity, frequently attending various trade fairs, exchanging for desired spiritual items. He also encountered many unique treasures of the foreign races, broadening his horizons.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang and Yu Chang'en’s interactions became more frequent, deepening their understanding of each other.</p><p>Yu Chang'en was astonished to learn that Qin Sang’s Daoist Sanctuary was established in the Mist Sea, and his enthusiasm grew.</p><p>Qin Sang also gained some understanding of Yu Chang’en’s character and the Yu Family’s strength.  Yu Chang'en was adaptable and far-sighted, maintaining a humble attitude before him.  In their discussions, he expressed the Yu Family's willingness to contribute manpower and resources, and their commitment to Qing Yang Sanctuary taking the lead in their cooperation.</p><p>As with all good things, this alliance wasn’t something that could be finalized in a few words. Even with Qin Sang and Yu Chang'en’s mutual willingness, they still needed to return and gather their people, discuss the details, and weigh the pros and cons.</p><p>Li Yufu and Yu Nu tentatively selected some candidates for the establishment of the trade association, including Hall Master Mu of the Six Provinces Hall and others.  They would begin preparations immediately upon returning.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yu Chang'en agreed on a time for Yu Chang'en to lead the Yu Family experts to visit Qing Yang Sanctuary. If he hadn’t returned from the Sacred Ground by then, Su Nu would receive them.</p><p>On this day, after a pleasant conversation with Yu Chang'en, Qin Sang saw Su Nu returning as he was seeing Yu Chang'en off.</p><p>"Have you encountered any trouble lately?" Qin Sang stopped Su Nu and asked gravely.</p><p>Su Nu was taken aback, then forced a smile.  "I still couldn't hide it from Brother Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  Su Nu had been disappearing for long periods lately, and her demeanor seemed off.  Even with his attention focused on the trade fair and Yu Chang'en, he had sensed something amiss.</p><p>"If it concerns your own secrets, I won't pry.  But if you’ve offended someone, even if they are beyond our match, we can ask Patriarch Yuan Xiang to mediate," Qin Sang said.</p><p>More than two hundred years had passed since their reunion.  Throughout these years, whenever he had a request, Su Nu had always assisted him wholeheartedly, even at the expense of her own cultivation. It could be said that without Su Nu, Qing Yang Sanctuary wouldn't have been established so quickly and smoothly.</p><p>If Su Nu was in trouble, he would naturally reciprocate.</p><p>"Thank you for your concern, Brother Qin."</p><p>Su Nu sighed softly. "Because it’s my personal matter, I haven’t dared to trouble Brother Qin. Please don't blame me, Brother Qin."</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Su Nu whispered, "I've found traces of my master."</p><p>"Your master?  In the Yuan Qiao Sea Market?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>He remembered Su Nu mentioning that her master had guided her for a period and then left, her whereabouts unknown ever since. Su Nu had said her master was a human cultivator, but that might not be the truth.  If her master deliberately concealed her identity, Su Nu wouldn't be able to see through it.</p><p>"I only found faint traces, and it’s unclear whether they were left recently or long ago.  I've been searching everywhere these past few days, but I haven’t found any more clues.  Moreover..." Su Nu's eyes flickered with uncertainty.  "That trace points beyond the Yuan Qiao Sea Market, deeper into the River of Misfortune!"</p><p>…</p><p>That night.</p><p>The bright moon hung high, casting its silvery light.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu quietly left the Yuan Qiao Sea Market.  Flying beyond the range of the mist, they immediately felt the chaotic power pervading the void.</p><p>Below, the sea churned with terrifying black waves. The Yuan Qiao Sea Market seemed like the only sanctuary in a world on the brink of destruction.</p><p>The polluted qi had receded somewhat, and the black curtain on the horizon was visible in the distance. The two slowly flew towards it.  Arriving at the edge of the polluted qi, feeling the oppressive force comparable to the Heavenly Might Black Tide, and witnessing the terrifying scene before them, their expressions turned grave.</p><p>"The depths of the River of Misfortune are unknown.  It’s best we don't venture in with our true bodies," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Su Nu nodded in agreement.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and descended towards the sea surface.  True Essence condensed into a block of black ice, bobbing with the waves.</p><p>They landed on the ice.  Qin Sang manifested his Dharma Body, while Su Nu took out a palm-sized stone carving. The carving's material was unknown, its color greyish-white, its expression blank.</p><p>Su Nu infused it with True Essence, and the carving's expression immediately became animated.  Then, she tapped its forehead with her index finger.  A point of black light, seemingly containing a complex rune faintly resonating with Su Nu's nascent soul aura, emerged from her fingertip and entered the carving.</p><p>The stone carving rapidly grew, transforming into a Stone Ghost War General, standing shoulder to shoulder with Qin Sang's Dharma Body as they charged into the polluted qi.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>Passing through the black curtain, Qin Sang instantly felt as if heaven and earth were splitting apart, far more chaotic than the scene they had witnessed from the edge of the River of Misfortune.</p><p>Qin Sang’s Dharma Body paused momentarily, gazing into the distance. Sadly, he didn't see the array of small worlds he had seen before. He turned to look at the Stone Ghost War General, who, with a subdued aura, was using a secret technique to sense the direction.</p><p>A moment later, the Stone Ghost War General pointed towards the front right, speaking in Su Nu’s voice, "There!"</p><p>Wherever they passed, heaven and earth changed color, accompanied by wind and thunder, causing even greater chaos.</p><p>Su Nu occasionally paused to sense the direction again, adjusting their course. Moving forward in this stop-and-go fashion, they ventured deeper, the scenes within the River of Misfortune growing increasingly bizarre and terrifying.</p>
