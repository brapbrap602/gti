<h1>Chapter 1698: Passing on the Teachings</h1><p>At that moment,</p><p>the entire galaxy seemed to shimmer for them.</p><p>Those who looked up at the night sky might have seen the unusual phenomenon, but they wouldn't know that someone was traversing the void. They would simply dismiss it as an illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the star-studded night sky, then at the now-empty altar.</p><p>Logically, resolving a five-hundred-year-old obsession should have brought immense relief.  Yet, Qin Sang felt as if she were in a dream, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p>The chill lingered.</p><p>The feeling of that moment, she knew, she would never forget.</p><p>Remembering the Ghost Mother's final message, Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>"Liuyin..."</p><p>She really had flown away, transformed into a firefly!</p><p>And Fei Can.</p><p>Now, all that remained beside him was the poison bead, the only remaining link to their five-hundred-year bond, a testament to the past.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended the altar step by step.</p><p>The altar itself appeared unchanged, but only now did Qin Sang realize that the power of the altar's formation had been exhausted upon completion of the sacrificial dance. It was now just a simple earthen platform.</p><p>The spiritual liquid in the spring was devoid of any spiritual energy.</p><p>The Ghost Mother's body still stood there, frozen in its final pose.</p><p>The Ghost Mother hadn't left any special instructions regarding her body.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it carefully, noticing that the skin was rapidly losing its luster. Cracked skin revealed Wu tribe divine markings, suggesting more than just a simple body snatching; it seemed the Ghost Mother had refined it using Wu tribe secret techniques.</p><p>She couldn't decipher anything more.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed her palm down, and the ground rumbled. The platform, the spring, and the Ghost Mother's body all sank into the earth, their traces erased.</p><p>After a final glance, Qin Sang flew back to Luye, her avatar quickly leading her people back as well.</p><p>The冥月卫 (Mingyue Guards) were completely unaware of what had happened, rather perplexed.</p><p>Qin Sang left orders for her return to the Northern Wilderness and then retreated to her cave for seclusion.</p><p>This time, she didn't enter meditative trance. She planned to carefully organize the gains she'd made at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. Since leaving, she'd been preoccupied with healing her injuries and Liuyin's ascension, and hadn't had time to properly sort through everything.</p><p>First, she would examine the many cultivation techniques she obtained at the ruined Wuxiang Immortal Sect. While she personally wouldn't find them useful,  they would be perfect for her disciples' training, now that she planned to establish the Qingyang Temple in the Central Plains.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang took out some blank jade slips and inscribed the other texts she had obtained.</p><p>These included three lineages: Water, Metal, and Wood.</p><p>The Water lineage was the most complete, encompassing both the Bingyi Palace and the Snowfield Tomb (with some overlap), as well as alchemic inheritances including the Boiling Snow Pill recipe.</p><p>The Wood lineage included several inheritances and the top-tier cultivation method, "Wood Emperor Strategy," along with the "Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele" divine ability and a complete crafting inheritance.</p><p>The Metal lineage comprised the sword formations recorded in the Golden Sword.</p><p>Other miscellaneous inheritances obtained from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect ruins were also amongst her finds.</p><p>Most of these techniques wouldn't suit Qin Sang, serving only as references, but they would greatly enrich the teachings of the Qingyang Temple. After all, they were all top-tier techniques.</p><p>Combined with the superior inheritances from the North Sea, her future disciples might be spoiled for choice.</p><p>Qin Sang realized belatedly that, having inherited so much from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, her Qingyang Temple could almost be called a "Little Wuxiang Immortal Sect."</p><p>After organizing these inheritances, she set them aside and retrieved the treasures she had fished from the treasure pool: the crude jade, Chengying Sword, broken drum, and scroll related to the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique."</p><p>Obtaining these four items had been entirely unexpected. They were either damaged or of unknown origin. Though she had time to study them, she remained stumped and decided to put them away. She might have better luck once her refining skills improved.</p><p>Of utmost importance were the eleventh and twelfth chapters of the "Meta-Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture," corresponding to the Nascent Soul and Void Refinement stages. Qin Sang was not yet at those levels, so she only gave them a cursory examination.</p><p>What shocked Qin Sang most was the transformation of the seven killing talismans with her rising cultivation.</p><p>Before Nascent Soul, a cultivator's main task was to refine the killing talismans. Then, in the late Golden Core stage, seven sword lights would be separated, which Qin Sang called sword souls.</p><p>Upon reaching the Nascent Soul stage, the killing talismans on the cultivator's life-bound spirit sword needed to be projected onto the seven sword souls, then fused with the cultivator’s seven souls.</p><p>This is all preparation for later stages.</p><p>With increasing cultivation, the cultivator could gradually separate seven sword spirits, each born from sword intent and dedicated to the sword way.</p><p>These seven sword spirits, along with the cultivator wielding their life-bound spirit sword, could combine to form the "Seven Souls Killing Formation," the true sword killing formation!</p><p>Of course, all this was still some way off for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his attention to other treasures with anticipation.</p><p>Among them were the Ice Instrument Divination Disk, the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, and the Ice and Fire Order, all related to the Transcendence Tribulation Formation.</p><p>With a thought, his avatar entered the chamber, picked up the Ice Instrument Divination Disk and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, along with a large quantity of spirit materials, preparing to set up a spirit nurturing array.  These two formations were not complex, and Qin Sang had already chosen a location in Luye.</p><p>Next were the spoils from the battle with the grotesque-faced man.</p><p>He didn't plan to use the Sky Linglong Spirit Embryo for the time being.</p><p>The wooden armor had been given to his avatar for refinement, to be used as a defensive treasure.</p><p>The Gu King, soothed by the Ghost Mother's secret technique, was now asleep.  There was no need for constant vigilance; Qin Sang would deal with it once he finished refining the poison pill, then the Gu King could consume it.</p><p>Lastly, there were the fragments of the Red Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>This treasure was severely damaged, unusable for cultivating the *Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele*, so it would be kept for future refinement.  Qin Sang couldn't abandon his avatar; to cultivate that technique, he'd need to find another foundation.</p><p>The treasures acquired on Fire Rhinoceros Island were few, but they proved most helpful on Emperor-bestowed Mountain.</p><p>The Mani Pearl was undoubtedly a defensive treasure, now holding the essence of demonic fire.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had been sleeping since leaving the mansion.  Once it consumed the frozen fire spirit, its cultivation would undoubtedly make great progress.</p><p>Despite various setbacks on Emperor-bestowed Mountain, the rewards were substantial.</p><p>The Fire Rhinoceros Horn, a Nascent Soul cultivator's remains, Daoist rhyme, Five Element Pills...</p><p>With the remains of a Wu Clan Nascent Soul cultivator as a foundation, subsequent cultivation of the *Panhu True Scripture* and improving the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's realm would be much easier.</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, the Five Element Pills were second only to the subsequent cultivation techniques, though trading them might involve further complications.</p><p>Su Zinan's remains brought Qin Sang a considerable windfall.  A true Nascent Soul cultivator's heir, his treasures were plentiful; the spirit stones alone could support the development of a sect.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man was far less wealthy, but even with his cultivation, he had gathered some precious materials.</p><p>Qin Sang kept the most valuable items, giving the rest to his avatar for future sect development.</p><p>Not all of the remaining treasures were usable; he could trade them for other treasures needed for cultivation.</p><p>Once these matters were settled, Qin Sang would enter seclusion to focus on reaching the late stage of his cultivation.</p><p>The wordless jade tablet’s Daoist rhyme and the Buddha bone relic had cleared away much of the dust from his path.</p><p>The Three Corpse Death God Banner—perhaps it would be more accurate to call it the One Corpse Death God Banner now—was still recovering after Su Zinan infused it with a demonic soul.  Qin Sang was refining it, intending to give it to his avatar along with the Qianhuan Mirror once it was repaired.</p><p>The Qianhuan Mirror had minor damage, easily repairable.</p><p>His avatar would then possess the wooden armor, Qianhuan Mirror, and the demonic banner—three major treasures—significantly increasing his strength.  He'd likely surpass most Grand Cultivators, even before he broke through to the next level.</p><p>Before the battle with the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, his avatar was already at the peak of his current stage, sensing a breakthrough opportunity; advancement to late-stage Nascent Soul was imminent.</p><p>His avatar's breakthrough, advancing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, and refining the essence of demonic fire—these were Qin Sang's next goals.</p><p>Other tasks included comprehending the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's legacy, refining the Taiji Immortal Terrace, and the Ice and Fire Order.</p><p>Despite having his avatar to share the burden, Qin Sang still felt overwhelmed.</p><p>One crucial matter remained: trading with Mo Xingdao for the Lingxi Immortal Fruit!</p><p>Su Zinan, through his Underworld Moon Guards, controlled several subordinates in the Northern Wasteland.  Qin Sang integrated them, and during his time wandering there, intelligence constantly flowed in.</p><p>Qin Sang closely monitored Ganlu Zen Temple's activities, seeking clues to find Mo Xingdao.</p><p>It was unclear what the Hui Guang Saint was plotting, but since the sect master entered the Guiyan Plateau, the Azure Fox Saint King and the Daoist, Buddhist, and demonic sects remained there.</p><p>Those who had participated in the Subduing Demons War, including Fan Laomo, the Poison King, and Yue Lingtian, had not appeared in public.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was likely still within the legacy mansion.</p><p>Qin Sang had dispatched an Underworld Moon Guard to infiltrate their designated meeting place and wait for Mo Xingdao.</p><p>With things organized, the avatar put away the treasures and left.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body stayed for a while before exiting the cave.</p><p>His cave, located deep within a bamboo forest, was the place Su Zinan had used to refine the Three Corpse Death God Banner.  Now, the gloomy atmosphere was gone, replaced by a fairy-like mist, giving it a true immortal aura.</p><p>A few steps later, Qin Sang heard a hissing sound.</p><p>The snake cave remained in its original place.  Some of the earthbound dragons Su Zinan had kept were still quite strong.  Qin Sang didn't intend to refine them; they could be excellent mountain guardian beasts, but he'd have to tame their ferocity first.</p><p>He left the bamboo forest.</p><p>The flower sea was still there, but Shen Chen's renovation had removed its artificiality, replacing it with a natural harmony that pleased Qin Sang.</p><p>This resourceful disciple also understands the master's intentions?</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, and flew to the other side of the flower sea.  Soon, she saw several newly built huts at the foot of the mountain, and heard Shen Chen lecturing.</p><p>In a bamboo pavilion, Shen Chen sat cross-legged, lecturing on very basic concepts, the kind suitable for beginners in cultivation. Xie Yi and Zhou Li listened attentively.</p><p>Behind them, several beautiful women also sat, looking equally serious.</p><p>Qin Sang landed beside the pavilion unnoticed.</p><p>At that moment, a woman carrying a bamboo tray with a teapot and jade cups hurried along a small path. Upon seeing Qin Sang, she was startled, cried out in surprise, and her hand trembled, nearly dropping the tray.</p><p>“Servant greets Master!”</p><p>The woman knelt down, her voice trembling.</p><p>The lecture abruptly stopped. Shen Chen emerged, knelt down to greet Qin Sang, and Xie Yi, Zhou Li, and the women all scrambled to their knees, some calling her Grandmaster, others Master, creating quite a commotion.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang look at the women, Shen Chen felt embarrassed and quickly explained, “Respectfully reporting to Master, not all of Su Zinan’s concubines were willing participants. After careful examination, I have erased the memories of most and sent them home. The few remaining, having no family, were confirmed to have been forcibly abducted, and begged to remain in Luye for the rest of their lives.  Remembering Master’s instructions, I dared not abandon them, fearing it might invite disaster, but I also didn’t dare to keep them without your authorization, and was planning to wait for your return to make a decision.”</p><p>“You’re quite compassionate,”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was unreadable.</p><p>Shen Chen felt uneasy.</p><p>“Luye can certainly support a few more people. Keeping them is fine; the mundane affairs of the sect need tending to. As for these…”</p><p>Qin Sang gestured toward the women who had been listening to the lecture.</p><p>Su Zinan’s favored concubines possessed a high proportion of spiritual roots. These were newly acquired; their cultivation was short, and their levels were low.</p><p>The women were terrified.</p><p>Their ill intentions, if any, would not escape Qin Sang’s perceptive eyes.</p><p>“Those with exceptional aptitude and character may be considered for the title of registered disciple.”</p><p>Dismissing the women, Qin Sang took Shen Chen and her two disciples to the mountaintop, where a temple had already been built according to her instructions.</p><p>The temple's furnishings were simple; the altar held no spirit tablets. Shen Chen and her disciples watched curiously as Qin Sang approached the altar, solemnly presenting three tablets: Yunyouzi, Jixin, and Mingyue.</p><p>Shen Chen, alert as ever, immediately led her disciples in paying respects.</p><p>“Qingyang Temple was founded by the senior Yunyouzi. I received favors from Jixin and Mingyue. Later, I carried out the late Yunyouzi's wishes, inheriting and developing the Qingyang Temple lineage…”</p><p>Shen Chen was surprised.  She couldn’t recall ever hearing of Qingyang Temple in Central Plains. Then she heard Qin Sang continue, “Qingyang Temple is located in the North Sea. I journeyed from the Outer Lands in pursuit of the Dao, traversing the Storm Belt for decades before finally reaching Central Plains…”</p><p>Shen Chen’s jaw dropped in disbelief.</p><p>Though they had never personally experienced the Storm Belt, they had heard countless terrifying tales. Their Master came from the Outer Lands! No wonder she was previously unknown.</p><p>Upon her emergence, she immediately made a stunning name for herself in Central Plains!</p><p>Shen Chen couldn’t fathom what it meant to travel through the Storm Belt for decades, and her respect for her Master deepened further.</p><p>“I am now re-establishing Qingyang Temple in Central Plains. Though separated by regions, the lineage remains unbroken. If you encounter fellow disciples from the North Sea, you must not engage in conflict…”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was stern as she outlined the sect's regulations.</p><p>Shen Chen, Xie Yi, and Zhou Li bowed their heads, taking it all to heart.</p><p>“Shen Chen, as my direct disciple, you are the second-generation disciple of Qingyang Temple.  Above you are Li Yu Fu, Mei Gu, Shangguan Lifeng, Zhao Ying, Tan Yi En and others…”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice softened as she mentioned these names; she didn't know how many were still alive.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the chances of disciples from both Qingyang Temples meeting were extremely slim.</p><p>However, the procedures had to be meticulously followed. If either side produced a Grand Cultivator who ventured out, a meeting would be possible.</p><p>While the master instructed her disciples,</p><p>Her avatar entered a specially carved cave behind the bamboo forest, rapidly launching various spiritual materials, establishing a spirit array, and then placing the Bingyi Divine Disk and Huoxi Divine Fire within to cultivate.</p><p>The avatar remained there, cultivating in seclusion beside the Bingyi Divine Disk.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p>With the new Qingyang Temple established, Qin Sang became a hands-off manager, leaving Shen Chen and the assistance of the Mingyue Guards to bring things into order.</p><p>As Qin Sang devoted herself to cultivation,</p><p>News finally arrived from the Northern Wastelands: Mo Xingdao had appeared at the agreed location!</p>
