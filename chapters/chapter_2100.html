<h1>Chapter 2091: Dire News</h1><p>Chapter 1960: Dire News</p><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>Within Qin Sang's cave abode, a phoenix-like cry suddenly echoed.</p><p>The sound was clear and resonant, filled with joy.</p><p>Crimson light illuminated the cave, overwhelming the scattered starlight. This scene resembled a raging fire engulfing a starry sky. At the heart of the flames, a Vermilion Bird was being reborn in fire.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Vermilion Bird with a strange expression.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird was clearly showing signs of an imminent breakthrough.</p><p>After the First Sword Attendant had reshaped its spirit, the Vermilion Bird awakened, regaining a cultivation base equivalent to the late Nascent Soul stage in humans, pausing before the Deity Transformation realm. Unexpectedly, it was breaking through at this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated this at all. He had invited the Vermilion Bird to help him comprehend the sword formation, but the formation was still incomplete.  Unexpectedly, a pleasant surprise occurred, helping the Vermilion Bird break through its bottleneck instead.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's origins were peculiar, and Qin Sang wasn't clear about its current state.</p><p>He didn't know how much the comprehension of the sword formation had contributed to the Vermilion Bird's breakthrough, but it certainly wasn't a coincidence.</p><p>“Could my feeling be correct? The Four Sacred Beasts, the South represented by the Vermilion Bird, does indeed have an unknown connection with the real Vermilion Bird lineage?  Could the stellar power of the Southern Seven Mansions resonate with the Vermilion Bird on some level?”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered.</p><p>Otherwise, he couldn't explain why the Vermilion Bird achieved enlightenment while he was cultivating.</p><p>Vermilion Bird, stars.</p><p>Wasn't the "Celestial Demon Body Tempering" technique about drawing upon stellar power to refine the body?</p><p>Given the First Sword Attendant's cultivation and status, she had specifically reminded him of this technique, indicating that "Celestial Demon Body Tempering" must have a profound origin, perhaps even one of the true Dharma of the demon race.</p><p>Could it be that the fundamental Great Dao pursued by the demon race, the Stellar Dao, is one of them?</p><p>This suggested that the insights he had gained from the Four Symbols Star Domain weren't without reason. They were related to his cultivation of "Celestial Demon Body Tempering" and manifested when he was comprehending the Four Symbols Sword Formation, providing significant assistance.</p><p>The cultivation techniques and divine abilities had unintentionally achieved a complementary effect.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>Another long cry interrupted Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>This cry held a hint of urgency.</p><p>At the same time, the Vermilion Bird's aura fluctuated violently, the resulting impact spreading out of the cave, affecting the spiritual energy within the entire Dao field, causing the Fire Spirit demon soldiers guarding the field to panic.</p><p>Ling Shi, who was cultivating, was immediately awakened. He rushed out of his cave and saw the stone mansion on the mountaintop burst open, a red light shooting out.</p><p>“It's alright, don't panic.”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice reached Ling Shi and the Fire Spirit demon soldiers. His deep and steady voice immediately calmed their panic.</p><p>Ling Shi flew down the mountain to appease the demon soldiers, as Gui Hou had entrusted them to his care before leaving.</p><p>The red light shot out of the Dao field and vanished in an instant.</p><p>Previously, the Vermilion Bird had entered the Transformation stage while sleeping and hadn't attracted a heavenly tribulation during its breakthrough.  Qin Sang wasn't sure if this Deity Transformation breakthrough would bring a tribulation.  As a precaution, he took the Vermilion Bird out of the cave to find a place for it to undergo the tribulation.</p><p>Now, there were more and more cultivators in the Fire Domain, making it difficult to find a secluded place. Qin Sang had to personally intervene, sealing off heaven and earth to prevent the tribulation's fluctuations from spreading and alerting other forces.</p><p>Above a volcanic range.</p><p>Qin Sang released the restrictions, and crimson fire erupted, the flames almost burning through the sky.</p><p>Knowing it could break through without restraint, the Vermilion Bird no longer suppressed itself, using all its power to assault the bottleneck!</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A sea of fire filled the sky, wave after wave surging higher. Any stray flame falling down could boil magma, collapse mountains, and create an apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Finally, a towering pillar of fire erupted from the sea of flames.</p><p>Along with the fire pillar came the Vermilion Bird's cry. This cry wasn't as sharp as before, but held more depth and joy!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's aura surged.</p><p>Qin Sang had been paying attention to the celestial phenomena, but there was no sign of tribulation clouds from beginning to end. Even as the sea of fire in the sky gradually subsided, he didn't sense the aura of a heavenly tribulation.</p><p>"The Vermilion Bird's cultivation in the past must have far surpassed the Deity Transformation stage. It seems that although the Vermilion Bird lost its memory, seemingly gaining a new life and cultivating from scratch, its connection with the past is unbroken. In the 'eyes' of the Heavenly Dao, it is merely gradually recovering its former cultivation. But what realm was this creature at before? How could a mighty being at the Body Integration stage or even the Grand Completion stage have such a terrible personality..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, suddenly feeling a weight on his shoulder. The Vermilion Bird withdrew its crimson fire and landed on his shoulder.</p><p>Glancing sideways, Qin Sang noticed significant changes in the Vermilion Bird's appearance. Its body was more slender, flames burned on its wings, and its tail had several long feathers with peculiar patterns. Its demeanor had completely changed.  It wasn't the fire crow from before, but now had a hint of a sacred beast's majesty.</p><p>However, its nature remained unchanged.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird looked around proudly, seemingly urging Qin Sang to praise it quickly!</p><p>Qin Sang erased the traces and returned to his cave, asking the Vermilion Bird to help him comprehend the sword formation. The Vermilion Bird no longer complained, happily coming over to cooperate fully!</p><p>After a brief attempt, Qin Sang immediately felt the difference, his eyes gleaming with surprise.</p><p>Waves of sword hums echoed within the cave.</p><p>Around Qin Sang, starlight glittered, forming two star domains. One was the Western Seven Mansions manifested by the Seven Mansions Starfield Sword Formation, and the other was the Southern Seven Mansions!</p><p>Compared to the Western Seven Mansions, the starlight of the Southern Seven Mansions appeared more ethereal, the connections between the stars less tight.  Some were bright, some dim.</p><p>The seven mansions felt scattered, each acting independently.</p><p>It wasn't enough to be called a 'formation'!</p><p>But at the center of the countless stars, a ball of flame shone brilliantly, illuminating the entire star domain. It was this flame that pulled all the stars together, connecting them, faintly forming a whole.</p><p>With this flame, the rudimentary form of a 'formation' appeared!</p><p>He hadn't expected the Vermilion Bird's breakthrough to bring such a significant change.</p><p>How could Qin Sang not be overjoyed?  Today was a double celebration. The Vermilion Bird's breakthrough and the sword formation's progress had far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>The rudimentary form of the sword formation was complete. Next, he only needed to gradually refine it, much faster than anticipated.</p><p>Moreover, the insights gained this time would also be a great reference for comprehending the remaining two sword formations. Even without the Azure Dragon and Black Tortoise sacred beasts by his side, the process would be much smoother.</p><p>"Hurry up and thank this Vermilion Bird!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird naturally sensed the change, immediately manifesting its form within the sea of stars, strutting proudly in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>"Well done, thanks to you this time. Keep up the good work."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate to praise it. He wished for breakthroughs every day, so letting the Vermilion Bird be proud for a bit was harmless.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird was indeed very pleased and enthusiastically threw itself into the sea of stars.</p><p>…</p><p>Achieving the top three places in the imperial examinations, even throughout Yan Country's history, was extremely rare.</p><p>At the Qionglin Banquet, the Zhuangyuan, the top scorer, was the center of attention.</p><p>The clamor would eventually subside.</p><p>While the entire nation discussed the new Zhuangyuan being a reincarnation of the Wenqu Star, the person in question, disguised, arrived at a small teahouse by the Jade Waist Lake.</p><p>"Senior Sister, I'll have to disguise myself every time I come here from now on," Yu Lang said, his face covered with a full beard, exuding a heroic air, his disguise flawless.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of people knowing his connection to the teahouse, but he was concerned about disturbing Xiao Wu's tranquility and affecting her integration into the mortal world.</p><p>"This is Xianghu Spring tea from Yinzhou. Zhuangyuan, try it and see if it compares to the Emperor's tribute tea."</p><p>Xiao Wu personally brewed a pot of tea for Yu Lang.</p><p>"Senior Sister is teasing me too."</p><p>Yu Lang complained playfully, but he was very happy inside.</p><p>In three years of living in the mortal world, his senior sister had changed a lot, even learning to joke.</p><p>Yu Lang thought of a slightly irreverent description: his senior sister seemed more… human.</p><p>Taking a sip of the tea, Yu Lang complimented its quality, then continued, "The Crown Prince wants to recommend me for a position in the Ministry of Revenue, but after careful consideration, I've decided to join the Hanlin Academy first."</p><p>"From my observations, although the Emperor is advanced in age, his health is still relatively good. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, he should have another decade."</p><p>"The Emperor's words carry weight. Appointing me as the Zhuangyuan also subtly expresses his stance on the Crown Prince."</p><p>"I advised the Crown Prince to be patient. The Emperor values tradition, and we are on the side of righteousness. We should remain calm and composed, unyielding regardless of the circumstances! Tao Teng agrees."</p><p>Yu Lang chattered on, sharing his secret discussions with the Crown Prince and Tao Teng, as well as their plans for the future, without reservation.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat opposite him, her chin resting on her hand, attentively listening.</p><p>Unknowingly, the sky outside darkened.</p><p>Yu Lang put down his teacup and said self-deprecatingly, "I'm not afraid of Senior Sister laughing at me, but I'm a little nervous and apprehensive. I felt the intensity of the world of fame and fortune at the Qionglin Banquet. Talking with Senior Sister makes me feel much more at ease."</p><p>He stood up and let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Xiao Wu said softly, "Come often."</p><p>"Mm!"</p><p>Yu Lang nodded firmly, walked out of the teahouse, feeling as if a burden had been lifted.</p><p>…</p><p>"Five years ago, I determined the Emperor had another decade to live. I almost thought I had misjudged, disgracing Master's name. Last month, the Emperor suddenly fell seriously ill, and news from the palace said it wasn't looking good. They were already preparing for the Emperor's demise. I didn't expect the Emperor to suddenly attend court this morning, looking healthy and showing no signs of recovering from a serious illness."</p><p>"This illness is suspicious. Several princes lost their composure, revealing some clues."</p><p>"The Second Prince is more composed than I imagined, but we still found traces of his involvement. Unexpectedly, the forces behind him are so deep. Fortunately, we discovered it early!"</p><p>"It's good that the Crown Prince heeded my advice, but it's time for Tao Teng to start making his moves."</p><p>"Oh, right, Master is already a prefectural magistrate, but he still refuses to leave the border and won't allow me to pull strings for him in court."</p><p>Only the two senior and junior disciples were in the private room.</p><p>Yu Lang revealed his true appearance. He had grown a beard, and the youthful look on his face was gone, replaced by the demeanor of someone in a high position.</p><p>He closed his eyes slightly, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>Only in front of his senior sister could he completely relax.</p><p>…</p><p>Another spring arrived.</p><p>Rain dripped, and there weren't many customers.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat bored at the counter. Looking up, she saw a scholar in a green robe, holding a folding fan, walk in.  She smiled slightly.  "You're here."</p><p>"I can never fool Senior Sister!"</p><p>Yu Lang hung his head dejectedly.</p><p>His disguise techniques were already masterful, but no matter how he disguised himself, his senior sister could see through him at a glance.  She had no cultivation, yet her eyes were still sharp.</p><p>"Because we're too familiar with each other."</p><p>Xiao Wu took out a canister of tea. "Try this new tea from outside."</p><p>They didn't go upstairs, but found a table by the window on the first floor with a view of the lake.</p><p>"Master's wife gave birth to a daughter.  Mother and daughter are safe.  Senior Sister should send a congratulatory gift, right?" Yu Lang said.</p><p>Xiao Wu asked happily, "What's her name?"</p><p>"Her nickname is Qi'er," Yu Lang glanced at the customers in the teahouse, suddenly chuckled, and secretly pointed to a scholar in the corner. "That Young Master Luo is here again."</p><p>The scholar sat alone, a table full of tea and snacks in front of him, but he seemed to have no interest in them, glancing over occasionally.</p><p>"I told you, Young Master Luo definitely likes Senior Sister," Yu Lang said teasingly.</p><p>To avoid trouble, Xiao Wu's disguised appearance wasn't outstanding, even intentionally flawed.  But inevitably, someone with discerning eyes would be attracted to her unique aura.</p><p>"Three days ago, someone came to propose marriage on his behalf."</p><p>Xiao Wu replied, her expression calm, without any shyness or embarrassment.</p><p>"A proposal?"</p><p>Yu Lang was stunned. "Senior Sister didn't agree?"</p><p>Xiao Wu looked at him as if he were a fool.</p><p>"Senior Sister, do you like him? Or rather, do you have even a slight fondness for him?" Yu Lang asked.</p><p>"I don't," Xiao Wu shook her head without hesitation. "I still don't know what liking someone means, but I don't see anything different about him compared to others, so I definitely don't like him."</p><p>"Actually, Senior Sister, you can try it.  Liking someone, being husband and wife for a lifetime. Master would definitely allow it," Yu Lang said carefully.</p><p>Being able to like someone meant she had truly integrated into the mortal world.</p><p>Being husband and wife for a lifetime, accompanying a partner through their entire life, then seeking the immortal path, wouldn't be a waste.  If the partner had talent, it would be even better, as they could become cultivation companions.</p><p>However, Yu Lang remembered that his senior sister's true form was actually a little girl of about five or six years old, and she had a cold nature.</p><p>It was hard to imagine what it would be like for his senior sister to be married.</p><p>"Are you getting married?" Xiao Wu asked.</p><p>Yu Lang nodded. "I can't put it off any longer.  Entering the mortal world means following the customs of the mortal world. That Tao Teng was practically forced into the bridal chamber and now has a son.  At my residence, matchmakers have almost worn down the threshold. I've met a young lady, the daughter of the Minister of Rites. She has both beauty and talent, but I need Master's permission."</p><p>"Master will definitely like the girl you chose.  Will Master come?"</p><p>Xiao Wu asked.</p><p>Qin Sang definitely wouldn't attend.  Only Chen Zhenqing would act as an elder.</p><p>"Master is worried about the people, but he should be returning to the capital to report on his duties soon. I don't believe in auspicious dates, I'll just wait for the day Master arrives in the capital," Yu Lang said, then glanced at Young Master Luo, offering him a silent prayer.</p><p>…</p><p>"The Emperor lived a year longer than I expected, but his health is declining rapidly, sustained only by medicine.  The princes have already begun their maneuvers.  I've been extremely busy lately and couldn't come.  The capital is a complicated place, and the situation is bound to be chaotic. Senior Sister, it would be best to close the teahouse for half a year.  The outcome should be clear by then!"</p><p>Yu Lang said gravely. Xiao Wu had sealed her cultivation, becoming a mortal, and would be swept up in the tide of events.  She needed to go with the flow.</p><p>Xiao Wu hummed in agreement, then said seriously, "You be careful!"</p><p>This warning wasn't for Yu Lang's own safety.</p><p>If things went wrong, he could always withdraw, but his ambitions and eleven years of effort in the mortal world would be wasted.</p><p>"Under our guidance, the Second Prince is revealing more and more flaws. The only variable is the Emperor's edict! Once the edict is issued, the Second Prince will have no chance of turning things around! Let's see if he has the audacity to stage a coup!"</p><p>Yu Lang sneered, spoke a few more words to Xiao Wu, and then hurried off.</p><p>The Crown Prince's Eastern Palace, the princes' residences, various government offices, the Qin residence, the Tao residence…</p><p>The capital, and even the entire Yan Country, was in turmoil, everyone making preparations. Countless eyes focused on the Imperial Palace, everyone waiting for news.</p><p>Just as the situation was about to explode.</p><p>Suddenly, an urgent report arrived in the capital.</p><p>Seeing the report, Yu Lang's face paled.</p><p>The Great Liang Kingdom had brazenly torn up the treaty.  Chaos had erupted at the border!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
