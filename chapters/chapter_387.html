<h1>Chapter 380: A Field of Corpses</h1><p>“Someone has been here!” Qin Sang’s heart sank.  He asked, puzzled, “Didn’t you leave a mark, Senior, so that no one would find this place?”</p><p>Wanderer Yun shook his head slightly. “There’s more than one path through these mountains. The Starvenom Frog’s nest is vast. If someone found another weakness nearby and converged here through a different passage, it wouldn’t be surprising. Judging by this Starvenom Frog’s carcass, it died at least two months ago… It’s completely silent here. Could all the Starvenom Frogs have been killed?”</p><p>As he spoke, Wanderer Yun shuddered.</p><p>The nest housed numerous adult Starvenom Frogs. Even Core Formation cultivators wouldn't dare trespass into this venomous lair!</p><p>The two exchanged startled glances.</p><p>“Brother Qin, do you remember what the Heavenly Wind Pavilion’s shopkeeper said? The chaos in Boundless Valley erupted very suddenly, unnaturally. Someone mentioned sensing an incredibly powerful aura pass through. Those beasts and ghosts seemed to have been scared away…”</p><p>Wanderer Yun’s tone was grave.</p><p>Qin Sang said hoarsely, “Senior, are you suspecting…”</p><p>Wanderer Yun slowly uttered two words, “Nascent Soul!”</p><p>…</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and Wanderer Yun, emboldened, ventured deeper into the Starvenom Frog’s nest.  The further they went, the more alarmed they became.</p><p>Countless Starvenom Frog carcasses floated on the mire, a gruesome sight. To describe it as a field of corpses wouldn’t be an exaggeration.</p><p>Among them were many adult Starvenom Frogs.</p><p>Every single frog had been killed with a single blow.  The venom sacs, the most precious and only valuable part of the Starvenom Frogs, had been completely plundered.</p><p>Moreover, they didn’t see even a single trace of a struggle, as if these venomous frogs, happily living in their nest, had been struck by a sudden catastrophe, completely unable to defend themselves.</p><p>Wanderer Yun quickened his pace, walking all the way to the end of the nest, yet he couldn't find a single living Starvenom Frog.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Wanderer Yun and tentatively asked, “Senior, could someone have beaten us to it?”</p><p>If a Nascent Soul cultivator had indeed passed through, even the strongest corpse puppet wouldn't be able to withstand them. It would have been easily obliterated, and any spiritual herbs would have surely been taken.</p><p>It would be pointless for them to continue venturing deeper.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>To Qin Sang’s surprise, Wanderer Yun shook his head with absolute certainty.</p><p>“Brother Qin, you don’t understand the Inner Valley. Those rumors in the market are just hearsay.  Very few people have actually entered the Inner Valley, so they’re not reliable.</p><p>“The Inner Valley of Boundless Valley is several times larger than the first and second layers combined. It’s a vast, boundless territory. The many dangers we encountered in the second layer are nothing compared to the Inner Valley.</p><p>“In the Inner Valley, ancient restrictions and spatial rifts intertwine everywhere.  There are also terrifying ancient beasts hidden within, no weaker than Nascent Soul cultivators. Without knowing the safe routes, I wouldn’t dare bring Brother Qin in to die.</p><p>“It’s impossible that this Nascent Soul cultivator happened to take the same path as us. We haven’t left the barrier yet. If we continue inward, we’ll see what’s really going on.”</p><p>The two continued forward.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Wanderer Yun’s direction required them to traverse the Starvenom Frog’s nest.  If those frogs were still alive, they would have had a difficult time.</p><p>After walking a bit further, the green mist began to thin. Wanderer Yun seemed to have discovered something else and picked up his speed. When Qin Sang caught up, he saw a severed limb of some beast on the ground, clearly not belonging to a Starvenom Frog.</p><p>“There are other beasts living here besides the Starvenom Frogs.  These are their natural predators, and they've been eliminated too.”</p><p>Wanderer Yun said self-deprecatingly, “Some senior has cleared the path for us. All the preparations I painstakingly made were for nothing…  However, it does save us a lot of trouble.”</p><p>The further they went, the more severed limbs they found. The beasts' blood stained the mire blue. The carcasses had been skinned and dismembered, with all valuable parts taken.</p><p>Suddenly, Wanderer Yun’s figure flashed, darting towards a piece of torn hide. He crouched down, staring at it, lost in thought.</p><p>The hide was only the size of a palm, covered in black bristles as hard as needles. In the center of the hide, there was an extremely fine cut. Other than that, there was nothing unusual about it.</p><p>“What are you looking at, Senior?” Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>“Shadowless Sword!”</p><p>Wanderer Yun let out a long breath, pointing at the cut on the hide.  “This sword mark was left by the Wuji Sect’s famed Shadowless Sword technique. No wonder those Starvenom Frogs died so silently! I didn’t realize it before, but I found it strange. Seeing this sword mark on the hide reminded me of this technique.”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned, utterly surprised. “Could the person ahead be the Wuji Sect Master?”</p><p>Before, they had assumed it was a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Demonic Path who had come here. They hadn’t expected it to be the Sect Master of the Wuji Sect, one of the eight righteous sects!</p><p>Wanderer Yun hesitated. “If it’s the Shadowless Sword, it makes sense. It might not be the Sect Master himself. A late-stage Core Formation expert from the Wuji Sect could also barely achieve this.”</p><p>Whether it was a Nascent Soul cultivator or a late-stage Core Formation cultivator, neither was someone they could provoke.  There wasn't much difference to them.</p><p>The two continued forward. They saw other severed limbs and hides, but none with similar sword marks.  Based on a single sword mark, Wanderer Yun couldn't draw any definite conclusions.</p><p>The space within the cave was more complex than Qin Sang had imagined. After seeing more remains of slain beasts, the terrain began to change. As they left the mire and turned into a stone crevice, after walking not far, they suddenly heard strange “cooing” sounds ahead.</p><p>There were beasts blocking the path ahead, but Wanderer Yun was overjoyed.  This indicated that the mysterious expert wasn’t taking the same route as them.</p><p>Wanderer Yun took out a tool refined from some unknown beast hide and covered both of them with it.  They passed through the group of beasts without incident and finally reached the cave wall, finding an extremely concealed and low-lying cave entrance.</p><p>…</p><p>“We’re finally out!”  Wanderer Yun exclaimed with feeling.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from behind Wanderer Yun.</p><p>After entering the cave, despite the winding and lengthy path, they encountered no other restrictions or beasts blocking their way and emerged smoothly. Fortunately, both of them remained unharmed and hadn't expended much energy. They had plenty of strength to face the dangers of the Inner Valley.</p><p>They were now in a narrow crevice in the mountains, with bright light emanating from ahead.</p><p>As they neared the end of the crevice, the first thing that came into view was a lush green grassland. A gentle breeze blew, causing the grass to sway like green waves rippling into the distance.</p><p>The rustling sound was strangely calming.</p><p>In the depths of the grassland, mountain shadows layered upon each other.</p><p>At a glance, it was a scene of tranquility, different from what Qin Sang had expected.</p><p>This beautiful scenery didn’t seem like it belonged here.  A look of surprise appeared on Qin Sang’s face.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s expression, Wanderer Yun guessed his thoughts and said with a smile, “Don’t be surprised, Brother Qin.  Take a few more steps forward, and you’ll see the true face of the Inner Valley.”</p>
