<h1>Chapter 1293: Good News (8k)</h1><p>Chapter 1293: Good News (8k)</p><p>“I didn’t expect to see you again, Daoist Master!”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng’s expression was complex, a mixture of joy at reuniting with an old friend and constraint.  Remembering something, he hastily asked, “May I ask where the other Daoist Master is now?”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “Senior Yunyouzi passed away many years ago.”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng fell silent, the feeling of self-abasement fading somewhat; at least he was still alive.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>A sudden, violent thunderclap echoed from the distance, the earth shaking.</p><p>In the depths of the dark clouds, lightning danced wildly, the flashes like a great sun, exploding and nearly tearing the clouds apart in a deafening roar.</p><p>Within the lightning, the shadowy form of a giant falcon was visible, its wings like hanging clouds, a divine bird seemingly commanding the thunder, soaring into the heavens with a sharp, piercing cry.</p><p>A sight that changed one's complexion, a sound that chilled one to the bone.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently, recognizing the magical display of Jingyu.  The astonishing scale of it indicated a formidable enemy. His face changed slightly, and he said gravely, “This isn't the time for reminiscing. You can use this token to find me later…be careful, Daoist friend.”</p><p>Qin Sang tossed a token to Shangguan Lifeng.  With a flap of his thunder wings, he transformed into a streak of lightning and shot towards the clouds.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng opened his mouth to speak, then hesitated, only realizing after Qin Sang disappeared from view that he had forgotten to ask Qingfeng Daoist’s real identity.</p><p>Qingfeng Daoist must have been using an alias; otherwise, he would have heard of him before.</p><p>He quickly turned the token over, seeing the character ‘Qin’.</p><p>He then recalled the unrealistically beautiful phoenix wings behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng suddenly thought of someone, his eyes widening.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>…</p><p>Zu Yuan had been plotting for a long time, setting a deadly trap in this place, a snare to ensnare their enemies.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance fell into the trap, defeat imminent.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang and the others unexpectedly joined the battle. This unexpected variable quickly changed the situation. After a fierce battle, seeing that he could not gain any more advantage, the Zu Yuan Yuan Ying hastily retreated.</p><p>After the great battle, Qin Sang and the two others were recovering their qi.</p><p>“Many thanks to the three Daoist Masters. Otherwise, not only would we have suffered heavy casualties, but the two of us might have perished,”</p><p>One of the two Yuan Ying commanding the army, after gathering the remaining soldiers, came before them, bowing to express his gratitude.</p><p>This person was a Tianxing Alliance elder, surnamed Zuo.</p><p>Elder Zuo was still terrified.</p><p>Zu Yuan's ambition this time was enormous; he not only wanted to destroy this army, but also to eliminate the two of them.</p><p>“The situation was too smooth earlier, almost making us forget that Zu Yuan was a man-eating tiger. A moment of slackness, and they exploited the opening,” Elder Zuo explained apologetically.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and said gravely, “It seems that Ye Laomo is still not satisfied. This must have been a premeditated counterattack, and surely not only Daoist Friend Zuo was attacked. However, the overall trend is unstoppable. Their attempt to hinder our advance is futile!”</p><p>Before his words had finished, another Yuan Ying arrived hastily.  “Just received a message from the Daoist Master; several armies, like ours, have been ambushed. The Daoist Master has ordered us to hold our ground; reinforcements are on their way…”</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances.</p><p>Zhenyi Laodao’s judgment agreed with Qin Sang’s: this was Zu Yuan's last gasp.  Once this offensive was crushed, Zu Yuan would have no strength left for a counterattack!</p><p>The overall situation was paramount.</p><p>There was no time to see Shangguan Lifeng.</p><p>After receiving the news, Qin Sang and the others left Elder Zuo to clean up the mess, while the rest immediately set off to provide support elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jingyu worked almost without rest, moving between several battlefields.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance pressed on relentlessly, their momentum unstoppable. Even when suffering setbacks, they did not easily collapse; most held their ground until reinforcements arrived, then launched counterattacks, preventing any widespread rout.</p><p>This was a large-scale war, lasting two days and nights.</p><p>After the battle, a torrential rain poured down.</p><p>The rain washed away the blood of two days.</p><p>Zu Yuan's final offensive was repelled. Seeing that there was no chance left, they finally gave up.</p><p>In this battle, the Two Realms Alliance suffered their heaviest losses since the counteroffensive began, but it also ignited their ferocity, leading to a more brutal counterattack against Zu Yuan.</p><p>…</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Since the great battle, the situation had been relatively calm.</p><p>Before Zu Yuan launched their invasion, the central area of the Great Plains was a buffer zone between Zu Yuan and the Tianxing Alliance, a long-disputed territory. Now, the armies of the Two Realms Alliance had crossed this area and were advancing into the heart of Zu Yuan territory.</p><p>Wherever the army went, cities, spirit mines, and other resources originally belonging to Zu Yuan fell into the hands of the Two Realms Alliance. Seeing the benefits, they were naturally unwilling to stop.</p><p>After a discussion among the Yuan Yings, it was judged that Zu Yuan was planning to retreat to their lair.  The decision was made to pursue relentlessly and drive Zu Yuan completely out of the plains.</p><p>As for storming Zu Yuan's lair, everyone knew that the possibility was low; it would surely provoke a desperate fight from Zu Yuan's cultivators. Even if the Two Realms Alliance could win, the cost would be extremely high.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance and Zu Yuan harbored deep-seated hatred. While some were eager for conflict, the cultivators of Xiaohan were calm and uninterested, refusing to be swept up in the frenzy.</p><p>Xiaohan emerged as the biggest winner of this war.  Aside from other benefits, they gained access to half the resources of the plains, previously unreachable, and secured a passage to the desert.  Moreover, Xiaohan's homeland remained untouched by war, with Zu Yuan held back at Tianxing Plateau, contributing only manpower and resources.</p><p>In an unnamed small city, an army had driven out Zu Yuan's cultivators and was currently resting.</p><p>Within the governor's mansion, Li Yu Fu rushed into the quietest courtyard, clutching a token.  Since his last retreat, Li Yu Fu had successfully broken through to the mid-Golden Core stage.</p><p>Despite recent continuous battles, Li Yu Fu felt no fatigue. In fact, he even smiled while meditating.  He recalled his Grandmaster's assessment of his senior master, filled with admiration.  Even when both were only Foundation Establishment cultivators, the Grandmaster had already recognized his senior master's potential.</p><p>Following this battle, Qin Sang would undoubtedly receive a significant share of the spoils.  A few of the plain's mineral deposits alone would be enough to support the growth of a sect.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's instructions, he and Mei Gu had been recruiting disciples for the Qingyang Sect among the unaffiliated cultivators. Using Qin Sang's name, few could resist, and they had found several promising candidates.</p><p>It was clear that once Qin Sang officially established the sect, the Qingyang Sect would instantly become an undeniable power!  This was all thanks to his senior master!</p><p>"To think, the Grandmaster's wish would be fulfilled so quickly…"</p><p>Li Yu Fu, his heart at peace, focused on cultivation, his worries gone. He understood this was temporary.  Countless sects had risen and fallen throughout history.</p><p>The Qingyang Sect still lacked deep roots, something that couldn't be established overnight, even by his senior master.  The responsibility fell upon them, the younger generation.</p><p>Li Yu Fu gripped the token firmly, his expression resolute. Arriving at the courtyard, he gently activated the restriction and whispered, "Senior Master, the acquaintance you mentioned is outside the governor's mansion, wishing to visit."</p><p>From within, Qin Sang's voice echoed, "Oh?  At last. Bring him in…"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his chamber, earth solidifying into stone, forming tables and chairs.  This was Shangguan Li Feng's first visit since their last encounter.  Qin Sang hadn't sent for him, seemingly having forgotten, but he had secretly investigated him, gaining some insight into his character.</p><p>Moments later, Li Yu Fu led Shangguan Li Feng in, bowed, and silently withdrew.</p><p>"Qin… Senior."</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng hesitated, bowing, but a gentle force prevented him from fully prostrating himself.</p><p>"We met when we were both insignificant. Why be so formal?  Call me Qingfeng Daoist from now on, it sounds more natural…"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, gesturing towards a stone bench, "Sit."</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist."</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng sat, still stiff.  Qin Sang sighed inwardly. The difference in cultivation was undeniable; their relationship could not return to how it once was, even if he wished to be gracious and welcoming. Shangguan Li Feng wouldn't dare accept it.</p><p>He studied his old acquaintance.  Shangguan Li Feng sat ramrod straight, dressed not like a Golden Core cultivator, but a worldly swordsman.</p><p>Clad in close-fitting attire, his treasured sword wasn't sheathed within him, but slung diagonally behind his back.  Though hidden, a razor-sharp intent emanated from it, as if ready to thirst for blood.  This was Shangguan Li Feng's unique technique, cultivating sword intent.</p><p>"Daoist friend, is something troubling you?"</p><p>Qin Sang, noticing the hesitation in Shangguan Li Feng's eyes, asked.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng, his concerns laid bare, stiffened, caught off guard. Since deciding to visit Qin Sang, he'd been indecisive, unsure how to approach the meeting. They were old acquaintances, but had only collaborated once.</p><p>Two hundred years apart, how different were they from strangers?</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng didn't believe their slight connection would warrant special treatment from a Nascent Soul master, especially considering he’d recently been saved by the other party.</p><p>If the other party were capricious, his audacity could be disastrous.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng steeled his resolve, rising abruptly, "Please forgive my impoliteness, Daoist. I wish to seek your guidance once more."</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated; he'd already seen through Shangguan Li Feng's intentions.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, without waiting for Qin Sang to ask, began recounting his experiences.  “When we last parted, the Daoist Master personally demonstrated the killing intent imbued within his swordsmanship, a sight that captivated me. I've carried that memory ever since, unable to forget it. Later, during a great battle, I threw myself into the fray, relentlessly pursuing this understanding for a hundred years, finally grasping a fraction of it. Without that, I wouldn't have faced so many trials, and wouldn't have achieved Golden Core so late in life.  But I have no regrets! However, after breaking through to Golden Core, I find myself lost… lost in the way ahead…”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng summoned his treasured blade, gently stroking it.  A look of confusion clouded his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly after listening, glancing at Shangguan Lifeng and then at the blade in his hand.  He then asked, “You say you pursued this for a hundred years. Were you truly enthralled by the Way of Killing, or were you captivated by the blade itself?”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's face froze at the question. He opened his mouth, but no words came out.  He instantly broke into a cold sweat, beads of perspiration trickling down his face, his lips trembling.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>‘Zhen!’</p><p>Without warning, a sharp sword’s cry pierced the air.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng started.  The world around him vanished – including Qin Sang – leaving only a single flying sword in his vision!</p><p>The sword was flawlessly crafted; every curve was perfect, light, transparent, like polished glass. That was his first thought.</p><p>Then, to his horror, he realized the sword had appeared before him, inches from his face! He hadn't even seen its trajectory before its point pressed against his forehead.</p><p>This was vastly different from his previous experience.</p><p>There was no boundless sword energy, not even a hint of killing intent.  It was pure, unadorned.</p><p>Yet, Shangguan Lifeng felt a profound sense of isolation, cut off from everything.  He knew, instinctively, that escape was impossible; he was utterly powerless.</p><p>His bones cracked, his arms felt heavy as mountains, his eyes bloodshot, his face flushed crimson. He was paralyzed.</p><p>The immense pressure, even at the brink of death, did not break Shangguan Lifeng's resolve.  He roared inwardly, his eyes wide, fixed on the sword before him.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's veins bulged, his expression contorted in a guttural scream.  He mustered all his strength, pouring all his True Energy into his blade, unleashing a mighty strike!</p><p>‘Shua!’</p><p>With his roar, the blade cleaved through the air like a rainbow, striking the flying sword directly.</p><p>In the next instant, the blade light and the flying sword vanished silently.  The crushing pressure on Shangguan Lifeng also disappeared.</p><p>“Hu hu…”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, using his blade to support himself, gasped for breath, feeling utterly weak, as though all his True Energy had been drained by that single blow.</p><p>“Jiji…”</p><p>Birds chirped in the sky.  A few birds flitted playfully through the air, oblivious to the events in the courtyard.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng snapped back to reality, as if awakening from a dream.  He sheathed his blade and bowed respectfully. “Thank you, Daoist Master, for your guidance.”</p><p>The strike hadn't dispelled all his confusion, but it had cut a crack through the dense fog, allowing him to glimpse a different perspective.  The experience differed from the last, though he couldn't quite articulate the difference.</p><p>He attributed it to the changes in their respective cultivation levels.</p><p>Nevertheless, Shangguan Lifeng cherished this feeling; it seemed to be what he had been desperately searching for.</p><p>“An old friend of mine practiced the same cultivation technique as I do. Based on that technique, he created a sword manual. This was the first form.” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was startled.</p><p>Qin Sang rose and walked towards his secluded chamber.  “As for my earlier question, come find me again when you've figured it out.”</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, sensing Qin Sang's dismissal, bowed slightly and left the courtyard.</p><p>Li Yu Fu was waiting outside.  Seeing him emerge, he gestured.  “My master has instructed me to prepare a quiet chamber for you. Please, follow me.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Shangguan Lifeng replied absentmindedly.</p><p>Li Yu Fu noticed his unusual demeanor, curious about what the master had done to him.  He wondered if Shangguan Lifeng would join the Qingyang Temple.  If so, the Temple would have three Golden Core cultivators.  And this man was quite renowned; his master seemed to hold him in high regard, perhaps even sensing Yuan Ying potential.</p><p>After that day, Shangguan Lifeng didn't seek out Qin Sang again.  Qin Sang didn't urge him, giving him time.</p><p>Since ancient times, blades and swords have been considered equals.  For lower-level cultivators, the difference is negligible; both are weapons of slaughter.  But at higher realms, the difference is vast, a world apart.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, unless he's willing to switch from blades to swords, will struggle to master the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.  He'd need exceptional talent, like that of the Green Bamboo ancestor, to understand both scripture and blade techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang thinks this is unlikely.  Shangguan Lifeng doesn't have much time left, given his lifespan.  Two hundred years isn't much to prepare for Nascent Soul ascension and create a new sword style – it's incredibly difficult!</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's strength lies in his focus; it's a gift.  If he follows the Green Bamboo ancestor's path, he might still achieve something. So, Qin Sang is willing to give him a chance.  But the hardest thing in the world is choosing, especially when it concerns one's own cultivation path.</p><p>…</p><p>The Two Regions Alliance has been relentlessly attacking, capturing city after city.</p><p>Recently, news has been constant, and the Alliance has learned of the Abyss's plan: they intend to completely abandon the plains and retreat to their stronghold, the Yu City, for a final stand.</p><p>Late at night.  In the main hall.</p><p>Qing Jun studies a magical sand table depicting the three regions, completely engrossed.</p><p>The hall's wards are triggered, and Qin Sang enters, smiling at Qing Jun's absorbed expression.  "Still worrying about the war, Shijie?"</p><p>Earlier, the Alliance's Nascent Soul cultivators met to discuss their next move after driving the Abyss back to Yu City.</p><p>Qin Sang joins Qing Jun, locating their positions on the sand table. He estimates, "If all goes well, we'll reach Yu City in ten days or so.  They say Ye Lao Mo has fortified the area like an iron fortress. Attacking or bypassing Yu City to strike at the Abyss's heartland is unrealistic; we don't have the strength to crush them."</p><p>Qing Jun agrees, then adds, "The Abyss has offered peace. The Desert faction has accepted negotiations, allowing the Abyss to redeploy all their troops to the north."</p><p>"Not surprising," Qin Sang scoffs, tracing a line north of Yu City on the sand table.  "Looks like we'll be facing a prolonged stalemate here.  Good. It'll prevent complacency and keep future generations vigilant."</p><p>"You're determined to become an ancestor.  Where will you build your sect?"</p><p>Qing Jun glances at him. "The Yuan Shen Gate is a good location.  It's close to the Sky Demon Hill and not far from the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea – both under your control. They can support each other. Let me be the bad guy – I'll give you Yuan Shen Gate. Given your reputation, no one will dare object. I've already made arrangements within the gate. Several talented new disciples are loyal to me, not Leng Yuntian.  You can take them into the Qingyang Temple; there will be no hidden dangers. The other Golden Core disciples are also quite sensible, you can decide their fate.  Though they are the children of my enemies, they've been obedient. It’s fitting to give them a place."</p><p>Qin Sang is startled. "Shijie, where are you going?"</p><p>Qing Jun says calmly, "My use of the Yuan Shen Gate as Leng Yuntian was a ruse. I don't want them to become a burden.  The war will soon end, and I can return to cultivation. Since you want it, it's perfect for you."</p><p>"I'm also fulfilling a friend's last wish… No rush. We can discuss it once the situation stabilizes.  The Ziwei Palace will soon open, and you might need help."</p><p>Qin Sang thinks the Qingyang Temple is about to get very busy.  Soon, it will include not only the Qingyang Temple lineage, but also the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, the Demon Flame Gate, and the Yuan Shen Gate lineages—plus the descendants of Green Bamboo and Qing Jun.</p><p>The Yuan Shen Gate is tempting, but not easy to manage; careful discernment is necessary. Without strong control, internal conflict might erupt if I'm not around.</p><p>Qing Jun doesn't say more; these are minor details to her.</p><p>"I called you because I've made progress on the spirit puppet."</p><p>Qing Jun closes the hall's wards and leads Qin Sang into a quiet chamber. The Nascent Soul puppet, no longer miniature, stands there, restored to its original form.  It's been here the whole time.</p><p>She touches the puppet's forehead, a faint light flashing from her fingertip.</p><p>The puppet's eyes snap open, still wild. It stares fiercely at Qing Jun.  If released, its first act wouldn't be killing enemies, but attacking its master!</p><p>"A senior from the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace had the brilliant idea of using talisman techniques to embed talismans in it, creating something akin to a talismanic weapon to control it. I possess a puppet seal technique; one of the seals is similar to the talisman.  With time, I can convert the talismans within the puppet to these seals and control it, just like the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace."</p><p>Qingjun struck at Fu Kui's chest.  Countless flickering符影 (fuying) appeared on Fu Kui's body.</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted at this news.</p><p>Although he had obtained the Yuan Ying Fu Kui, he didn't know how to control it.  If he tried to obtain the secret techniques from the Shangyuan Quiet Palace, Dongyang Bo would certainly interfere and cause complications.  His senior sister was extremely skilled in puppetry; she had indeed found a way.</p><p>"However..."</p><p>Qingjun's tone suddenly changed. "Even if it's transformed into a Kui Yin, it won't change its inherently aggressive nature. This is why the ancestors of the Shangyuan Quiet Palace were helpless against it.  With your cultivation level, controlling it will still be extremely dangerous. It's best to find a treasure that can protect your primordial spirit."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, frowning. "Even senior sister can't resolve the chaotic soul shadows within the Fu Kui?  If all the soul shadows could be refined and merged with the Fu Kui, wouldn't its power increase?"</p><p>"You're right, but it's almost impossible. Unless we can understand why the Fu Kui is so special, able to seal the soul shadows and exist to this day."</p><p>Qingjun examined the Fu Kui for a long time, then sighed.  "I've pondered this for a long time, but I can't find the reason. In my opinion, it's highly likely not due to the restrictions within the Fu Kui, but the Fu Kui itself!"</p><p>This thought coincided with Qin Sang's; he had a similar feeling.</p><p>There are countless strange treasures in the world of cultivation; they've seen far too many, and the Fu Kui is layered with restrictions, its original nature obscured. It's very difficult to ascertain its origins.</p><p>Qingjun formed a hand seal. The Fu Kui suddenly shrank and flew into Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>"I've used a secret technique to complete part of the transformation. Now I'll teach you this Kui Yin.  It just takes time; methodically transform the Fu Yin into a Kui Yin. Take it back and refine it yourself. These soul shadows are of no use to me. However, sensing as many soul shadows as possible will definitely help you overcome your bottleneck. You might break through to the mid-stage soon."</p><p>"Thank you, senior sister."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Fu Kui in his hand. Whether he could succeed as his senior sister said depended on the Fu Kui and the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper.</p><p>Next, Qingjun taught Qin Sang the Kui Yin.</p><p>Puppetry, like swordsmanship and alchemy, is complex and profound.  Without dedicated study, it's hard to achieve anything.</p><p>Fortunately, his senior sister had laid the groundwork. Qin Sang didn't need to learn the complete technique; he only needed to remember the Kui Yin and a few precautions.</p><p>Having learned the Kui Yin, Qin Sang was about to leave when his expression changed. He sensed something and stood up abruptly, surprised. "Bai has arrived!"</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Talisman within Bai was created by Qin Sang. There was always a connection between them. When they were close, they could sense each other.</p><p>Qin Sang was uncertain.</p><p>Bai's emergence from seclusion and sudden appearance on the battlefield—what problem had he encountered?  Or had he successfully broken through to Corpse King?</p><p>Qin Sang quickly bid farewell to Qingjun and flew out of the hall towards the city.</p><p>The army was stationed in the city, with strict defenses. Bai couldn't sneak in, and triggered the city's defenses outside, which Qin Sang sensed.</p><p>Qingjun, watching Qin Sang's departing figure from outside the hall, frowned slightly, seemingly lost in thought.  She looked towards the direction of the Abyss of Sin before returning to her room to meditate.</p><p>"Senior Qin!"</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Qin!"</p><p>...</p><p>To avoid breaking his self-imposed rules, Qin Sang didn't fly directly out of the city, but flew through the city streets.  Cultivators along the way, upon seeing Qin Sang, quickly gave way and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang quickly reached the city gate, looked at the soldiers on either side, took out his token, and showed it. "Open the city gate's restrictions!"</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>The guards didn't dare to be negligent and immediately complied.</p><p>It was late at night.</p><p>The sky was overcast, with no starlight visible.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the city, surveying his surroundings.  After flying several dozen miles, he suddenly lost contact with Bai.</p><p>Then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The grassland below exploded, creating a large crater.  Soil, rocks, and grass flew everywhere.  Amidst the debris, a dark shadow silently lunged towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then delighted, laughing heartily. "Brother Bai, I'm not the same as before.  With such petty tricks, you think you can ambush me?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking…</p><p>Eighteen demonic banners suddenly flew out from his sleeves, swirling in the air, expanding rapidly in the wind, and erupting with demonic fire, instantly forming a sea of flames.</p><p>A dark figure plunged unexpectedly into the demonic flames, immediately letting out a series of startled cries.  "When did you learn to control all the demonic banners?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't reply, only laughing mockingly. "Dare to ambush this old man?  Taste the demonic fire!"</p><p>With that, he made a hand gesture, and all the demonic flames surged towards Bai, instantly engulfing him in a ball of fire.</p><p>"Relying on external objects, what kind of hero are you?! Come down and fight me hand-to-hand!" Bai shouted defiantly, trapped in the flames.</p><p>"Hand-to-hand combat? I'm not afraid of you either!" Qin Sang scoffed, though his eyes showed a flicker of surprise.</p><p>Within the demonic flames, Bai wore a Daoist robe, appearing outwardly normal except for his pale complexion. After sensing the true power of the demonic fire, he used some unknown secret technique.  His corpse energy surged, but his size remained unchanged. Unlike the corpse kings from the Immortal Tomb, he didn't become a monstrous figure with green skin, long claws, and black hair. Only his eyes turned blood red, filled with bloodlust.</p><p>For a moment, the demonic flames were held at bay. Even when a few flames touched him, they caused him no harm.  An ordinary corpse king couldn't withstand the demonic fire so easily.  It seemed Bai had gained significant benefits from the Corpse Soul Orb and the Bone Curse.</p><p>"I'm done! Your demonic banners are too overpowered!" Bai yelled.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted the banners, and they both landed on the ground.</p><p>"Congratulations, Brother Bai, on your advancement to Corpse King!" Qin Sang offered his congratulations.</p><p>Bai waved his hand dismissively, looking around and sighing, "My breakthrough came too late. I've probably missed so many good things."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "From returning from the Abyssal Ruins until now, you've been through countless battles, facing Ye Lao Mo at Blood Lake – those were hardly 'good things'!"</p><p>"Exploring secret realms is definitely a good thing! Tell me everything about your encounter at Blood Lake," Bai urged impatiently.</p><p>"Come back to the city with me. We can talk more thoroughly there."</p><p>The two flew towards the city.</p><p>Qin Sang said happily, "I was planning to protect you during your tribulation, yet you bravely went ahead and crossed it without telling me! Did anything unusual happen?"</p><p>"I finally sensed the right moment and didn't dare wait for you to return, so I found a place and forcibly crossed the tribulation. It was indeed different from yours. I nearly failed the heart demon tribulation, but it ended safely." Bai grinned, still a little shaken.</p><p>"Your strength clearly surpasses that of an ordinary Corpse King. You must have been confident about overcoming the tribulation," Qin Sang nodded, recalling the strange sight earlier. He quickly asked, "Now that you're a Corpse King, have you completely broken the Heavenly Corpse Talisman? Why did I sense its presence intermittently earlier?"</p><p>"It's essentially broken! Because the Heavenly Corpse Talisman has merged with my primordial spirit, it's difficult to shatter it.  But it no longer affects me. The reason I secluded myself for so long was to resolve the issue of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman."</p><p>Bai opened one hand, and his flesh gradually became transparent, revealing the bones beneath, etched with strange markings.</p><p>"The Bone Curse!" Qin Sang recognized it instantly.</p><p>Bai nodded. "While studying the Bone Curse, I discovered that despite being completely different, the Bone Curse and the Heavenly Corpse Talisman have a subtle connection, as if they share a common origin.  I used the Bone Curse to manipulate the power of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman. After countless failures, I finally succeeded."</p><p>"The Heavenly Corpse Talisman is merely a foundation establishment-level artifact. I never expected it to be this troublesome!" Qin Sang sighed, realizing the talisman was far more difficult than he imagined.</p><p>"The Heavenly Corpse Talisman is mostly used to create Flying Night Rakshasas, but that doesn't mean that’s its true level.  The power displayed by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the Bone Curse is just the tip of the iceberg.  And their methods are extremely bizarre.  None of the corpse path secret techniques you collected correspond to them. It took me immense effort to unravel some of their workings. To understand their true origins, we must find the mysterious person in the water dungeon.  These two secret techniques are definitely of great significance!"</p><p>Seeing the joy on Qin Sang's face, Bai understood his thoughts and abruptly changed his tone. "Don't get too excited. My method only works on myself. Ya Gu's cultivation base is too low to withstand the full power of the Bone Curse."</p><p>Qin Sang's smile froze. He had hoped Bai could help Ya Gu remove the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, resolving one of his major concerns.</p><p>"But don't worry. I've come up with a solution to alleviate the immediate problem. While I can't cure her, I can improve her condition, pulling her from the darkness and restoring her to her state before she was depleted, or possibly even better. The exact extent of her recovery is uncertain; the fat silkworm is a variable that might help us. Of course, to fully cure Ya Gu, we still need to find the mysterious person and obtain the complete secret techniques." Bai explained.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. "That's good news. Once the war is over, I'll send people to search for Tan Hao's whereabouts. We're almost at the city gate.  Friend Daoist, please remain concealed for now. Enter the Corpse Puppet Pouch."</p>
