<h1>Chapter 1792: Drawing from Heaven and Earth to Nourish the Self</h1><p>The Spiritwood Body Appears!</p><p>Among the towering ancient trees, Qin Sang didn't appear small.  As he rose, the surrounding wood spirit energy was drawn to his Spiritwood Body, surging towards him and coalescing into a substantial, emerald green mass.  It formed a constantly rotating vortex centered around Qin Sang.</p><p>The aura of the Spiritwood Body blended with the forest.  The wood spirit energy, as it swirled, continuously poured into the Spiritwood Body, being absorbed by Qin Sang.  In an instant, he, who had just shown signs of defeat, rapidly recovered his lost vitality.</p><p>Seeing this, Li Hou's expression changed, his eyes revealing shock.  He finally understood why Qin Sang hadn't fled, choosing to fight here.</p><p>Drawing from Heaven and Earth to Nourish the Self. Directly absorbing power not inherently one's own from the world to replenish one's deficiencies—this is a divine ability possessed only by great masters of the Five Talismans and powerful demon kings!</p><p>Among the Dongxuan Masters and Demon Lords, only those with extraordinary talent or those who have reached the peak of cultivation and honed their skills for years might grasp even the surface of this technique.  Throughout the Dao Court and the Gui Fang kingdom, such individuals are as rare as phoenix feathers and dragon scales, all of them top-tier experts.</p><p>This person, merely at the early stage of Dongxuan, has actually mastered such a miraculous ability!</p><p>After a brief moment of shock, Li Hou regained his composure, not deterred by Qin Sang. This power shouldn't belong to a Dongxuan Master.  Forcing its use wouldn't be without cost. The simplest point:  without refinement, absorbing external energy directly into the body, even if usable, will inevitably pose hidden dangers, causing chaos, or even damaging one's foundation.  If it exceeds one's capacity, the body might even collapse.  Even among Dongxuan Masters, top-tier experts well-versed in this aren't reckless with its use; their capacity has limits.</p><p>Li Hou's guess was correct.  In fact, the *Post Heaven Wooden Man Stele* does have many hidden dangers and limitations. This technique can only draw upon the wood spirit energy from plants; in other environments, many of its abilities are limited. The Spiritwood Body primarily enhances Qin Sang's physical body.</p><p>Wood spirit energy carries abundant life force. Using precious spirit plants as a medium weakens the damage to the user. That's why Yuan Ying late-stage cultivators can barely utilize it.  But drawing wood spirit energy still places a heavy burden on the cultivator. Even without the burning of Ice Instrument Palace, back then, the grotesque-faced man only dared to carefully absorb a portion of the wood spirit energy, slowly replenishing himself.</p><p>Unfortunately, Li Hou didn't know that Qin Sang's medium was the Yandao Tree, surpassing even the legendary ten great divine trees.  Qin Sang felt pressure, but it wasn't yet a burden, meaning he could sustain this for a longer time!</p><p>"Unless you destroy this entire forest, I am invincible. Li Hou, do you still wish to fight to the death?"</p><p>An astonishing aura erupted from Qin Sang.  Here, the forest and earth were real, yet not ordinary. The areas damaged in the previous battle now had saplings sprouting from the ground, growing at an astonishing speed.  Unlike the Ice Instrument Palace, even if Li Hou's innate ability could turn the entire space into a swamp, it couldn't destroy this forest.  The wood spirit energy is practically limitless.</p><p>But these words sounded boastful to Li Hou, who coldly sneered, "I did underestimate you! But how many times can you use this?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes turned sharp.  He thrust his arms forward, his tree-branch-like, withered hands overlapping.  A powerful force erupted, causing the void to crack with thunder; a furious wind, like a dragon, surged forth with unmatched might.</p><p>With a deafening roar, a badger-like shadow appeared in the gale. Its claws extended, clashing with Qin Sang's palm from a distance. They didn’t make contact; the impact’s shockwave exploded between them, uprooting surrounding vegetation, pulverizing it in mid-air, and creating cracks across the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped when he saw an opening, deciding against a deadly struggle with Li Hou, and retreated.  Li Hou didn't pursue, his eyes narrowed. In that strike, he clearly felt Qin Sang had grown stronger; the Spiritwood Body not only helped him recover but also increased his combat power.</p><p>With formidable defense, the unique Spiritwood Body, and exceptional evasion and combat instincts, even an early-stage Dongxuan Demon Lord likely wouldn't be his match.  Outside, unless certain the person was alone, Li Hou wouldn't want to provoke such a troublesome opponent.</p><p>However, to make Li Hou back down, this wasn't enough.</p><p>Li Hou judged that Qin Sang's current state couldn't last. Glancing upwards, he still saw traces of gold amidst the green glow of the sky, indicating the golden light hadn't fully dissipated.</p><p>This person clearly intended to stall using this divine ability, but it was futile. As long as the golden light persisted, their only hope was for a human cultivator to pass by.</p><p>By transforming into a Wood Spirit body, this person had trapped themselves within this forest space, leaving no escape.</p><p>Li Hou could have continued to engage, using his superior cultivation to wear down his opponent.</p><p>However, in Li Hou's eyes, even the strongest Wood Spirit body was nothing more than a living target, while he possessed complete freedom of movement.</p><p>In a flash, Li Hou closed in on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, having transformed into a Wood Spirit body, appeared clumsy but moved with surprising agility. His arms, powerful like dragons, swung wildly.</p><p>Compared to Qin Sang, Li Hou appeared smaller and nimbler, his figure a blur as he darted around Qin Sang, each strike precisely aimed.</p><p>Seen from above, a giant, sentient tree was running wildly across the ground, pursued by a small creature resembling a squirrel – a stark contrast in size, yet the smaller creature relentlessly chased the tree.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Each collision reverberated throughout the forest.</p><p>Qin Sang, using the Seven Masters Buddha Seal in his Wood Spirit form, unleashed even greater power. Even when occasionally struck by Li Hou's claws, he managed to avoid vital areas. The wood spirit energy quickly healed the wounds on his bark-like skin.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>An ancient tree withered instantly.  Qin Sang had just leaped from its trunk when a dark shadow erupted from the ground.</p><p>Li Hou pursued relentlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly leaped to avoid the attack.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang used his Wood Spirit body's abilities to leap between trees, temporarily eluding Li Hou.</p><p>After several attempts, however, Li Hou adapted, burrowing underground and accurately predicting Qin Sang's movements, appearing from beneath the earth to relentlessly pursue him.</p><p>However, because Qin Sang consistently avoided direct confrontation, his energy depletion was far slower than Li Hou anticipated.</p><p>With an angry snort, Li Hou's eyes widened, turning black.  Whirlwinds seemed to swirl within his pupils.</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>The ancient trees on the ground suddenly grew wildly.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed that the ground itself was rising, creating a floating peak in mid-air.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The ground fractured, breaking into countless pieces of varying sizes.</p><p>Simultaneously, a powerful wind arose from the heavens.  This was no ordinary wind.  As it swept over the fractured earth, the two elements merged, forming a black cloud that violently churned in the sky, emitting the sound of muffled thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up to see black orbs forming within the cloud.  While uncertain of their nature, his instincts screamed danger, prompting him to sprint outwards with all his might.</p><p>But the cloud moved incredibly fast, remaining suspended above him.</p><p>‘Whoosh…Whoosh…’</p><p>The orbs, fully formed, shot down from the cloud.  A dozen or more, each the size of a human head, streaked towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Deep within these orbs, wind and thunder seemed to clash, radiating an extremely violent aura.</p><p>Meanwhile, Li Hou continued to circle Qin Sang, forcing him into a desperate struggle.</p><p>A sudden change. Qin Sang felt a surge of alarm, his steps faltering.  He disregarded everything else and thrust out a palm, unleashing two seals simultaneously. With a ‘bang’, he blocked a fatal blow aimed at his throat, then used a lightning escape technique to move sideways.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the orbs seemed drawn to him, pursuing relentlessly.  Qin Sang could evade no more and braced himself, raising his fists to defend.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A dark light bloomed before Qin Sang's fists.  An instant later, thunder shook the heavens as the light exploded into black lightning.</p><p>Now it was clear: the orbs were, in fact, thunderballs.</p><p>Li Hou sneered. This was the Xun-Tu Yao-Lei (巽土妖雷), a powerful ability he had derived from his bloodline, capable of locking onto opponents, rendering evasion almost impossible.</p><p>The cloud continued to track Qin Sang relentlessly.</p><p>The cloud resembled a calamity cloud pursuing a tree spirit, unleashing countless thunderballs in rapid succession.</p><p>Qin Sang had to defend against Li Hou's unpredictable attacks while simultaneously enduring the relentless barrage of Xun-Tu Yao-Lei, his flight becoming increasingly erratic and desperate.</p><p>This was precisely what Li Hou wanted.</p><p>Faced with Li Hou's relentless pursuit, Qin Sang continued to use his Wood Spirit body to dart between the trees, but to little effect. The Xun-Tu Yao-Lei would not cease until it struck its target; evasion was futile.</p><p>He had no choice but to activate his protective abilities to withstand the attacks directly.</p><p>Qin Sang drew upon the wood spirit energy in the forest to heal, recovering quickly but also consuming energy at an alarming rate.</p><p>After some time, Li Hou, who had been observing Qin Sang, his eyes gleamed, acutely noticing a change in Qin Sang's condition.</p><p>The power of drawing on the wood spirit’s energy was no longer as overwhelming, and its recovery slowed considerably!</p><p>His guess was confirmed.</p><p>Li Hou let out a wild laugh, his figure flickering as stone armor enveloped him, transforming into a stone beast comparable in size to Qin Sang, standing firmly on the ground just like his opponent.</p><p>An earth-shattering battle ensued.</p><p>If witnessed by mortals, it would have appeared as two monstrous beasts locked in a desperate struggle.  Two cultivators at the Divine Transformation stage engaged in a brutal, purely physical brawl, their fighting shaking the very earth.</p><p>It wasn't entirely a physical fight. Li Hou relentlessly pressed his attack, leaving little room for maneuvering.  Any divine ability attempted was broken before it could fully manifest, resulting in an almost primitive display of combat.</p><p>Dust billowed, leaves flew wildly.</p><p>Dark clouds hung overhead, and thunderbolts continuously rained down upon the battlefield, bolstering the ferocity of the fight.</p><p>Li Hou, impervious to his own wind and earth thunder, attacked recklessly. The force of his blows aimed at Qin Sang was so immense that even the stone armor on his arm shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, dared not slacken.  He was constantly on the defensive, leaping through the forest to evade the relentless blows.</p><p>But Li Hou gave him no respite.  The moment a tree showed signs of withering from Qin Sang's energy absorption, the ground nearby would swell, the stone beast ever shadowing its prey.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang's movements became more strained, the effect of the wood spirit energy's restoration diminishing and becoming increasingly noticeable with each passing moment.</p><p>Exactly as Li Hou had predicted.</p><p>The more wood spirit energy drawn, the greater the backlash, resulting in a comprehensive weakening.  Absorption slowed, restoration weakened further.</p><p>Moreover, as pressure mounted, Qin Sang's foundation trembled, his blood circulation faltered, and his strength diminished.</p><p>Li Hou watched coldly, as one might observe a trapped beast making its final desperate struggle.  He seemed patient, unhurried, intending to deliver the killing blow only when Qin Sang reached his weakest point.</p><p>However, this was merely a facade.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Five thunderbolts struck in rapid succession.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted as he expertly used a spatial displacement technique.</p><p>A distant ancient tree instantly turned yellow and brittle, its leaves rustling down, stripped of its life force.</p><p>Qin Sang leaped from the cracked trunk, only to be met by a colossal shadow, charging towards him.</p><p>He wasn't surprised. Planting his feet, he formed a hand seal to meet the attack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the expected collision didn't happen.  As the stone beast lunged, its chest suddenly split open, revealing a transparent, needle-like spike aimed directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Li Hou’s true form emerged from the fissure, a sneer on his face.</p><p>Killing a weakened opponent ensured success. Li Hou knew this, and Qin Sang certainly understood it as well.  Any remaining countermeasures Qin Sang possessed would be reserved for that moment, a final, desperate gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang was a cultivator at the Xuanzhuan stage; Li Hou wasn't keen on experiencing the full force of his last-ditch effort. Instead, he chose to strike when least expected, a moment of maximum vulnerability.</p><p>This was precisely the moment when Qin Sang's guard was most relaxed!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The spike was impossibly fast, appearing before Qin Sang's chest in an instant, ready to pierce him clean through.</p><p>At the very last second, Qin Sang forcefully twisted his body, a green light flashing as a suit of armor materialized.</p><p>The armor was merely a magical treasure, nothing special.  Yet, the moment the spike struck, it encountered immense resistance, halting mid-air.  Where the spike touched, the armor dissolved into water, yet this impossibly gentle flow somehow stopped the weapon.</p><p>Li Hou’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>A demon cultivator would typically choose a part of their body for relentless refinement, forming a sort of personal treasure.  Common wisdom assumed Li Hou’s chosen body part was his claws since he favored them in battle.  Other demon lords believed this, too.</p><p>His claws were a mere deception, however. The true treasure was the spike.</p><p>The spike was made from a bone in his mouth, refined over countless years, its power extraordinary. When he joined the demon king's forces, he once sparred with the king's top demon lord.  At the time, only in the early stages of Xuanzhuan, he injured his opponent with the bone spike, rising to fame and gaining the demon king's favor.</p><p>The spike was now even more powerful, his ultimate move, yet it couldn't even pierce a mere suit of armor!</p><p>Qin Sang also felt a chill of fear, having to acknowledge the spike's terrifying power.  Unfortunately for Li Hou, he met his match. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly precisely tracked the spike’s trajectory, allowing the fragment of a precious treasure to intercept and stop it.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The spike flew back.</p><p>Li Hou instinctively checked, confirming it was his familiar bone spike, his expression completely altered.</p><p>Suddenly, Li Hou turned into a black streak and shot towards the sky, abandoning his weakening prey without hesitation.</p><p>If the opponent didn't want a prolonged fight, why not show their full strength from the start?  Seeing so many powerful abilities and treasures, he must have thought long and hard before attacking.</p><p>Clearly, the opponent had ulterior motives!</p><p>Recalling Qin Sang's actions...</p><p>Better safe than sorry!</p><p>Before Li Hou could escape, a calm voice echoed, “Thinking of leaving now? A little late, don't you think?”</p>
