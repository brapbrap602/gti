<h1>Chapter 2204: An Unexpected Turn of Events</h1><p>Qin Sang made a cursory inspection.  After careful refinement, the skull could be restored, but it would likely be unusable within the Sacred Land. This battle yielded abundant spoils, but the cost was considerable; the Mingshan Armor and the corpse puppets were destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the skull and inquired about Liuli's injuries and experiences.</p><p>Liuli recounted the entire ordeal.  Although she downplayed it, Qin Sang sensed the immense peril she had faced.  He recalled his own experiences in the Divine Court, finding similarities, though he was forced into it, while Liuli seemed to have sought it out.  He sighed softly, "There are many opportunities to kill enemies; you didn't need to take such a risk."</p><p>"But I may only have this one chance for tribulation," Liuli whispered.</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless. Liuli's personality had changed, but her stubbornness remained.</p><p>Liuli's tone shifted, lightening up. "Later, I only needed to guide the Emperor's Control Talisman's inherent power to manipulate the cold energy. The pressure was greatly reduced, so my injuries aren't serious. However, the talisman's power was previously unleashed excessively, making it difficult to stabilize. I need to retreat for a while…"</p><p>Even after this battle, the Emperor's Control Talisman still hadn't exhausted its power.</p><p>Since Qin Sang also needed to recover, they made some preparations nearby and both entered meditation.</p><p>Of those who pursued them, a black-robed cultivator survived, but Qin Sang lacked the strength to hunt him down. If the cultivator was wise, they could coexist peacefully.</p><p>For safety's sake, they couldn't stay in the Panlong Cave for long, lest the black-robed cultivator summon reinforcements to conduct a thorough search. Qin Sang planned to leave once his injuries stabilized.</p><p>…</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>Qin Sang held a transparent centipede, his eyes gleaming with cold light.</p><p>The transparent centipede let out a pained cry, its body curling into a ball, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Qin Sang had extracted a confession from it; the mastermind was Yuan Jian!  Previous suspicions were now confirmed.</p><p>The man in green robes wasn't aware of Yuan Jian's motives, but it was certain that Yuan Jian wasn't specifically targeting Qin Sang. He was trying to curry favor with the Grand Attendant and the Immortal Child, and Qin Sang was merely a pawn.</p><p>This whole turmoil was orchestrated by Yuan Jian. If given the chance, Qin Sang wouldn't show mercy, but killing Yuan Jian wasn't the priority.</p><p>He learned much from the man in green robes. His name was Tang _____.  Ten thousand years ago, one of Tang's ancestors broke through to the Saint Realm, elevating the entire family to prominence. They all moved to the Sacred Land.  Tang _____ was a later generation, but he possessed exceptional luck, steadily cultivating to the Void Realm, Second Stage, reclaiming his rightful place. Unexpectedly, his ancestor chose him for this operation, placing a heavy burden on Tang _____.</p><p>From Tang _____, Qin Sang learned the true nature of the Sacred Land. It was vast and boundless, overflowing with spiritual energy—a cultivator's paradise, yet isolated from the larger world. The Ancestors of the Yi Ren tribe intentionally controlled the population, resulting in sparsely inhabited lands.</p><p>The cultivation grounds contained many spirit beasts and ferocious beasts raised by the Ancestors, as well as vast tracts of precious spiritual herbs and medicines, which required the younger generation to tend to.  These tasks were relatively easy and provided some rewards, ensuring no shortage of cultivation resources.</p><p>In Tang _____’s account, the Ancestors spent most of their time in seclusion.  Those summoned by an Ancestor upon their rare emergence were few and far between. Before reaching the Void Realm, Second Stage, he'd only received guidance from an Ancestor twice.</p><p>Although only twice, it was something others wouldn't dare dream of. Tang _____ had used this to break through critical bottlenecks.</p><p>Qin Sang unexpectedly discovered that the image of the Ancestor in Tang _____’s memories was extremely vague.  He dared not pry further, and continued to question Tang _____ about the matter, learning the cause.</p><p>"A mark?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Before departure, the Ancestor hadn't said much, only placing a mark on Tang _____.  Once the time was right, the mark would react, and they were to follow its guidance.</p><p>They had originally planned to hunt down Qin Sang, but the mark's activation forced them to abandon the pursuit.  The mark pointed to this very island!</p><p>"Isn't this the place where Daoist disciples fight? How is it connected to the Ancestors of the Yi Ren tribe?" Qin Sang was puzzled, feeling uneasy.  Would their plans be affected?</p><p>With Tang _____'s death, the mark dissipated. Qin Sang found a similar mark on the Immortal Child's corpse, its power seemingly vanishing with his death.</p><p>The ancestor of the Gou clan left guidance in the sacred land.  Is this sigil similar in purpose?” Qin Sang took out the seal obtained from the Bi Xie ancient temple, unable to discern its meaning.  More thought was useless; it seemed a personal visit was necessary.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang sorted through their remaining belongings.  There were several high-quality spiritual treasures alone, but subduing them wasn't a quick task. For now, they remained untouched.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the jade bracelet belonging to the celestial child. This treasure, named the Imprisoning Earth Divine Ring, sounded related to the Trapping Heaven Golden Lock.  Their powers were very similar; Qin Sang suspected they were a set.  Simultaneously activating both would greatly enhance their power, but Qin Sang couldn't refine them immediately.</p><p>“You’re awake?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up.  Seeing Liuli regaining consciousness, her breath steady, he pointed to the ground. “We owe the defeat of those enemies to the fairy’s restraint.  Choose some spoils.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s concerns proved unfounded; Liuli took a portion of the loot without hesitation.</p><p>After dividing the spoils, they considered leaving Panlong Cave.  Exiting through the main entrance was impossible. Fortunately, the cave was becoming increasingly chaotic, with powerful forces constantly colliding, suggesting new paths might have formed.</p><p>…</p><p>*噗!*</p><p>A large hole opened in the ground, and two figures flew out from below.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli searched patiently and found an exit, bursting through the earth and escaping Panlong Cave.  He suppressed the escaping energy waves, checked the surroundings for anything unusual, and then quickly left with Liuli.  Once they reached a safe area, they paused, gazing towards the island's depths.</p><p>“Four days!” Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>It was their fourth day. Half of their ten-day limit was almost gone.  This was because they'd left early; full recovery would have taken much longer.  They needed to achieve their goals within these few days and deliver the jade bracelet entrusted to them by Hong Yue into the depths of the Heart Lake; otherwise, they couldn’t answer to Hong Tian.</p><p>Time was pressing. Qin Sang and Liuli didn’t hesitate, quickly moving through the dense fog.  Lacking sigil guidance, they could only estimate the direction. Luckily, they encountered no further danger and gradually approached the island's center.</p><p>Upon reaching their destination, the ominous feeling proved true.  The island's center had undergone a cataclysmic change; the recorded landscape was utterly destroyed.</p><p>The records described a lake ahead, pure as a green emerald, one of the entrances to the secret realm.</p><p>Now, the lake was gone, replaced by a boundless, ferocious storm and familiar radiant light!</p><p>“Could the radiant light be seeping into the Heart Lake?” Qin Sang’s heart sank.  Aside from the light’s danger, the storm's power was terrifying!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Liuli.  For him, absorbing the mountain's essence to restore Mount Taiyu was ideal; even if he failed, he’d only lose a treasure, his cultivation unaffected.  But for Liuli, missing this opportunity meant risking a forced crossing of the Heart Demon Tribulation later!</p><p>This secret realm was clearly abnormal.  Even if they could enter and the opportunity remained, there was no safe environment.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  Their only option was to investigate.</p><p>They agreed that Liuli would provide cover while Qin Sang approached the storm.</p><p>The moment he touched the radiant light, the familiar scene repeated: a gray figure emerged from nowhere and attacked. Fortunately, no monstrous beast tide appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed forward against the gray figure's attacks.  As expected, the storm's power was overwhelming; he soon struggled to advance.</p><p>Continuing was pointless, as Liuli couldn’t remain here.  But Qin Sang persisted until he could go no further, then retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, seeing Liuli’s expectant gaze dim. He saw only endless radiant light and the storm, which had destroyed everything.  The recorded secret realm no longer existed.</p><p>“Let’s search elsewhere. The experts from the sacred land and those Daoist disciples might know something,” Qin Sang said, unwilling to give up. The records mentioned another entrance, and most of the other Daoist disciples entered through there.</p><p>“Mm!”</p><p>Liuli nodded, and they concealed themselves, flying along the storm's edge towards the other entrance.</p><p>…</p><p>In a mountain valley, four human cultivators sat cross-legged on rocks—the four Daoist disciples, including the sword-wielding Daoist.</p><p>Four cultivators stared at the secluded realm, their faces grim.  Unlike Qin Sang, who had no enemies here and proceeded directly to the realm upon arrival at the heart lake, they were thwarted by the storm and radiant light, failing to secure the lead.</p><p>"Who's there! Show yourselves!"</p><p>Suddenly, a sword-wielding Taoist from Bi Chen Xuan's lineage scowled and shouted.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>His sword was drawn, pointed towards the mountaintop. The others reacted instantly, spreading out to encircle the peak. They seemed to have put aside their differences, forming a temporary alliance.</p><p>A moment later, an invisible ripple appeared on the mountaintop.</p><p>"Please calm yourselves, it's us," Qin Sang and Liuli appeared, bowing politely.</p><p>"It's you!" A Taoist beside the sword-wielder pointed at Liuli, shouting angrily.  The others also glared.</p><p>Clearly, due to the Purple Cloud Mountain incident, Ning Zhenren's lineage was the least welcome among all Taoist sects.</p><p>The sword-wielding Taoist, having guessed Qin Sang and Liuli's intentions, gestured to stop the other Taoist, saying, "You've both seen the situation. The realm is inaccessible, and we're all blocked.  Your presence… do you have a solution?"</p><p>He seemed highly respected; the others implicitly acknowledged his leadership.</p><p>"To be frank, we encountered an unforeseen delay, arriving only just now.  We don't know the cause of this, and would like to ask for your insight. When did this storm and light appear?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused. "Considering the current circumstances, our previous conflicts are meaningless.  There's also the threat of the Outsiders. Let's set aside our differences and work together.  We can resume our competition after solving this immediate problem."</p><p>The other Taoist snorted, but didn't object.</p><p>The sword-wielding Taoist's expression softened. He sheathed his sword. "It's best that you feel this way, fellow cultivators.  Regardless of sect, we are one. We are weak now; only by working together can we overcome this.  To be honest, the realm was like this when we arrived."</p><p>He gestured. "Please come down and talk."</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the valley with his spiritual sense, confirming the absence of traps, before descending with Liuli.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang said, "Your defenses are too weak.  You should set up a concealment formation!"</p><p>"Have you sensed something unusual?" the sword-wielder asked, puzzled.</p><p>There were no signs of a beast tide, and the grey figures wouldn't attack proactively; it seemed safe for now.</p><p>"You don't know?"</p><p>Liuli and Qin Sang exchanged a glance, revealing the information. "We understand that many Outsider ancestors have sent their juniors to the Sacred Lands.  Among them are peak-level experts, at least at the late Nascent Soul stage, converging here."</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"How many? Why didn't we encounter them?"</p><p>The four were shocked.  The sword-wielder asked gravely, "Did you both see this with your own eyes?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Sensing something was amiss, we concealed our identities to investigate.  Fearing exposure and being outnumbered, we didn't delve deeper.  Their target is undoubtedly here!  As for why you haven't encountered them, perhaps they knew and were not blocked, having already entered the realm.  We are also puzzled why this realm caught the attention of the Outsider ancestors, and what secrets it holds…"</p><p>While speaking, Qin Sang and Liuli observed the four, their gazes finally resting on the sword-wielder, who looked thoughtful.</p><p>"You seem to know something," Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"It's not much of a secret.  My master mentioned that when the Outsiders established the Sacred Lands, they sought help from the Supreme Daoist Sect's elders, before the sect's division.  The Outsiders' establishment of the Sacred Lands relied heavily on our Taoist power.  In return, a section in the core of the Sacred Land was given to the Taoist sects.  My master didn't elaborate on what the sects did with it…"</p><p>The sword-wielder turned to the realm. "Now it seems, it's likely this place!"</p><p>The sword-wielder's account matched Qin Sang's deduction, but didn't explain why the Outsider powerhouses would come here.  If the rumor was true, and this place was given to the Taoist sects, why would they fight over it again?</p><p>Everyone brainstormed, offering various explanations, but found no answer.</p><p>"What's the use of speculating here! Those who are attracted will come later. Why don't we capture one and interrogate them!" the other Taoist impatiently suggested.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I'll be attending a meeting in the city tomorrow for training, so I'll be taking a day off. I've been quite busy this past week, and will let you know in advance if I need to take any other days off.</p>
