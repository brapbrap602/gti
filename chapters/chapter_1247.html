<h1>Chapter 1239: Moon in the Water</h1><p>Dongyang Bo, clad in a brocade robe and wearing a Vajra Circlet atop his head, walked forward with his hands clasped behind his back. The Vajra Circlet trembled incessantly, and with each vibration, a phantom image of a treasure shot forth. Though the phantom was dim and lacked the brilliance of the original, it was still formidable. A blood shadow, unable to dodge in time, was firmly ensnared by the phantom. No matter how it struggled, it could not break free. With a gentle shake, the phantom completely annihilated the blood shadow within.</p><p>This treasure was Dongyang Bo's life-bound artifact, nurtured and refined over many years. It had long since ascended to the rank of a supreme-grade treasure, with endless miraculous uses. Dongyang Bo moved with ease, paying no attention to the blood shadows around him. Instead, he focused on Gongliang Yu's movements, a faint smile playing on his lips.</p><p>The deeper they ventured, the stronger the blood shadows became. Even the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet could no longer kill them with a single strike. Gongliang Yu could feel the Azure Spirit Light within his soul steadily draining away. Once this light was exhausted, he would have no choice but to recall the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet. At the bottom of the Blood River, relying solely on his own strength, he would be utterly helpless!</p><p>Gongliang Yu's expression grew anxious as he urged the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet to charge deeper into the riverbed. The pressure grew increasingly intense. The blood shadows, nurtured by the Blood River for countless years, possessed not only bizarre abilities but also grew stronger and harder to kill. Even when cleaved in two, they would split into two separate blood shadows, fearless and relentless.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet's body flickered with talisman shadows, revealing its true power. Various spirit talismans—Water Talismans, Fire Talismans, Thunder Talismans, and Demon Spirit Talismans—flashed across its form, each representing a different power that had been refined and integrated into the puppet's body. The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet's techniques were ever-changing, with wind, fire, thunder, and lightning alternating as it unleashed heavy punches to annihilate the blood shadows.</p><p>After venturing deep into the Blood River, Gongliang Yu finally spotted something other than blood shadows. Below, amidst the blood mist, a crimson stone stalagmite jutted out. Its tip was sharp, already stained blood-red by the mist, glistening like a blood diamond. Seeing the stalagmite, Gongliang Yu's heart leaped with joy. He had finally reached the bottom of the Blood River.</p><p>Without hesitation, he plummeted downward and soon landed on solid ground. The terrain here had been tempered by the constant erosion of the blood mist, transforming the earth and stone into an incredibly hard substance. Gongliang Yu didn't have time to survey his surroundings. He dashed forward, as the blood shadows drawn to their presence grew in number, surrounding them. The pressure on the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet intensified.</p><p>The ground was uneven, riddled with trenches and sharp stalagmites. The good news was that, aside from the ever-present blood shadow wraiths, they had yet to encounter any other monsters. Gongliang Yu and the puppet charged ahead, heedless of how many more blood shadows they might attract. At this point, it didn't matter—there were already too many to count.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet dutifully protected Gongliang Yu, who remained unharmed. However, the sheer number of blood shadows made Gongliang Yu's face pale. He only hoped to find the Blood Ganoderma as quickly as possible and escape this perilous place.</p><p>After charging forward for a while, a deep trench suddenly appeared ahead. The trench stretched across their path, nearly straight, with both ends reaching the riverbanks. It spanned a thousand feet in width, its depth unfathomable, and its edges were unnaturally smooth. Trenches were common at the bottom of the Blood River, but one of this shape and scale was rare. Who knew what might be lurking within?</p><p>"This is the trench!" Gongliang Yu exclaimed inwardly, unable to hide his excitement. The Blood Ganoderma wasn't growing within the trench, but the trench was the most obvious landmark. According to the information he had received, spotting the trench meant the Blood Ganoderma was close at hand.</p><p>The senior who had ventured here before had found the Blood Ganoderma unripe and had reluctantly left it behind, unwilling to harvest an immature spiritual herb. Instead, he had left it for future seekers.</p><p>Gongliang Yu and the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet leaped over the trench and continued their rapid advance. Soon, they noticed an area where the blood mist flowed unusually. Before they could get close, a strange pressure assailed them. Gongliang Yu's body swayed, and his protective spirit armor rippled violently. His expression changed drastically. The pressure was nearly enough to tear his armor apart.</p><p>Slowing his pace, he approached the anomalous area and found that the blood mist here was far denser than elsewhere. The ground dipped, forming what seemed like an underwater lake at the riverbed. At the center of the blood mist, a rich crimson light emanated. Within the light, a mushroom-like herb the size of a plate floated atop the blood mist, bobbing as if on the surface of blood water.</p><p>The herb was entirely blood-red, as if forged from congealed blood. It had only one leaf, round like a full moon, indicating its maturity. Its surface was smooth, with a coin-sized protrusion at its center, shaped like a skull—both eerie and mesmerizing.</p><p>It was the legendary Blood Ganoderma, a rare spiritual herb said to aid cultivators in forming their Nascent Souls!</p><p>"Finally..." Gongliang Yu's heart raced as he spotted the Blood Ganoderma from a distance. The herb emitted no fragrance, which Gongliang Yu found unsurprising. In a place like this, it was a miracle the herb didn't reek of blood. Any scent it might have had was likely drowned out by the thick blood mist.</p><p>The spiritual herb was right before him! But the blood shadows they had attracted were growing in number. Gongliang Yu quickly scanned the area and saw no guardian beasts near the herb. The senior who had come before hadn't mentioned any either. These blood shadows despised all outsiders, and no spirit beast could survive here unless it was an exceptionally intelligent anomaly among the blood shadow wraiths.</p><p>Given the commotion they had caused, the lack of reaction around the Blood Ganoderma suggested there were no guardian beasts.</p><p>"Go!" Gongliang Yu barked, and two talisman lights shot out from his dantian. One was the Heavenly Blade Talisman, which he had refined to perfection. The other was the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, familiar to Qin Sang, and all nine dragon souls were intact! As for Qin Sang's talisman, Gongliang Yu had no use for it after forming his Nascent Soul and had given it to Li Yufu, instructing him to use it only in life-or-death situations due to its dubious origins.</p><p>The dragon souls coiled around him as the Heavenly Blade Talisman manifested its true form, slicing through the pulling force ahead. Gongliang Yu merged with the two talismans, following closely behind the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet as they pushed back the blood shadows and charged toward the Blood Ganoderma.</p><p>However, halfway there, Gongliang Yu felt the pressure growing unbearable. He knew he wouldn't be able to withstand it much longer. Seizing the moment, he ordered the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet to go ahead and harvest the herb while he focused on fending off the blood shadows with his talismans.</p><p>"Roar!" The dragon souls roared as the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman was pushed to its limits. The Heavenly Blade Talisman unleashed countless blade rays. Thunder, spirit fire, wooden vines, and mountain peaks—powerful talismans were unleashed without hesitation.</p><p>Gongliang Yu struggled to maneuver, watching as the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet finally reached the Blood Ganoderma and reached out to grab it.</p><p>But to his shock, the puppet's hand passed through empty air!</p><p>The Blood Ganoderma shattered like a moon reflected in water.</p><p>Gongliang Yu's smile froze, replaced by disbelief. Before he could comprehend what had happened, the Blood Ganoderma reformed, as radiant and hauntingly beautiful as before.</p><p>Before Gongliang Yu could figure out the reason, he suddenly sensed a powerful aura erupting behind him, closing in rapidly.</p>
