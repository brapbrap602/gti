<h1>Chapter 993: Ancient Restriction</h1><p>“Having the Moon Rhinoceros Horn doesn't mean you're completely safe. Fellow Daoist, if you feel its aura weakening or becoming indistinct, do not go any deeper.  Even Demon Kings have nearly become lost within…”</p><p>Yuan Zhu gave a word of caution as he handed the Moon Rhinoceros Horn to Qin Sang.</p><p>“Thank you, Fellow Daoist Yuan… Farewell!”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly tested the horn in his hand, then cupped his hands towards Yuan Zhu before vanishing into the wind and waves.</p><p>Yuan Zhu watched Qin Sang depart, then glanced at the jade slip in his hand, his eyes filled with fervor.  He couldn't wait to return to his cave and comprehend the techniques within.</p><p>Qin Sang weaved and dodged through the hurricane, heading straight for the depths of the storm belt.</p><p>He opened his palm and summoned the Moon Rhinoceros Horn.</p><p>The small horn rested in his palm, radiating a cool sensation.</p><p>“You were right to gamble on this.”</p><p>Bai’s slightly weary voice came through. He was still recovering from near exhaustion. “With the Moon Rhinoceros Horn, we should be able to shake off Old Demon Mu. But don't let your guard down. I remember you mentioned there might be spatial rifts in the depths of the storm.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement. “Although I’ve never entered the depths of the storm belt, I've witnessed the horrors of spatial rifts in the ancient battlefield of the Xiao Han Region. I imagine there are plenty here as well. Fortunately, the Skyeye Butterfly can help me stay alert.  We can avoid most spatial rifts. As for the most dangerous, invisible ones, the chances of encountering them are extremely low unless we go too deep.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang awakened the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly emerged.</p><p>Sensing its master’s urgency, it gently touched Qin Sang’s chin with its soft wings, silently comforting him.  It then obediently settled on Qin Sang's shoulder and activated its Skyeye ability, vigilant against any potential dangers.</p><p>Feeling the butterfly’s thoughts, Qin Sang's gaze softened, and his anxiety eased.</p><p>The fire curse flared again.</p><p>It was difficult to determine the storm's impact on the fire curse in the short term.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the incantation Yuan Zhu had given him and activated the Moon Rhinoceros Horn.</p><p>As his true essence flowed into it, the horn’s glow intensified, emitting a soft moonlight. Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, sensing carefully. He could clearly feel a strange resonance, guiding him.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the storm.</p><p>The chase continued.</p><p>Old Demon Mu’s expression was grim. He had a strong premonition that he might fail this time.</p><p>His prey's decisiveness was alarming.</p><p>If they went any deeper, even Old Demon Mu would have to worry about getting lost. He hadn't anticipated this outcome and lacked any treasures to navigate the storm belt.</p><p>His prey, seemingly unconcerned by the dangers of the storm’s depths, charged onward as if courting death.</p><p>Most frustratingly, the fire curse's fluctuations were being disrupted by the storm, making it less precise.</p><p>Old Demon Mu had to fully activate the fire curse for a long time to barely sense his prey’s approximate location, wasting time and drastically reducing his efficiency.</p><p>Moreover, his earlier haste in pursuing Qin Sang, using his blood escape technique for too long, had severely depleted his essence blood. His brief rest on the island had only suppressed his injuries, not fully healed them.</p><p>This hidden weakness forced him to stop and recover periodically, significantly slowing him down.</p><p>His prey had clearly noticed this and dared to play games with him.</p><p>The fire curse flared.</p><p>It persisted for a long while before fading.</p><p>Once the fire curse’s fluctuations disappeared, Qin Sang decisively changed direction.</p><p>The chase resumed.</p><p>The Moon Rhinoceros Horn’s glow had dimmed somewhat.</p><p>Spiritual tides and hurricanes intertwined here, creating utter chaos. Spatial rifts were a frequent sight, some spanning hundreds of feet, others intersecting dangerously.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully navigated this treacherous environment.  Sensing Old Demon Mu’s slowing pace, an idea struck him, and he began to play a game of hide-and-seek.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Old Demon Mu was also cautious in this area, fearful of becoming lost. His ability to sense the fire curse had become even more blurred, only providing a general area.</p><p>At this rate, catching his prey was nearly impossible.</p><p>Old Demon Mu could only hope that his prey would eventually exhaust their spiritual resources, so he continued to trail from a distance.</p><p>Qin Sang grew increasingly composed.</p><p>He even slowed down during Old Demon Mu’s recovery periods, seizing the opportunity to refine impurities within his true essence, calm his agitated energy, and consume spiritual medicines or absorb spirit stones, no longer needing to waste the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>“I can barely condense a Demonic Fire Curse Seal to suppress the fire curse and lose him…”</p><p>Bai’s voice sounded as he awoke.</p><p>With a portion of his depleted spirit power restored, Bai condensed a Demonic Fire Curse Seal, sealing the fire curse.  At the same time, Qin Sang chose a direction and flew off.</p><p>Arriving in an unfamiliar sea region, Qin Sang felt a wave of relief wash over him. They had finally shaken off Old Demon Mu.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't tell where they were, but with the Moon Rhinoceros Horn, they wouldn't get lost.</p><p>Completely removing the fire curse would have to wait until Bai fully recovered.</p><p>Bai withdrew the seal and returned to cultivate.</p><p>Qin Sang flew aimlessly through the storm, trying to put as much distance as possible between himself and Old Demon Mu.</p><p>To his surprise, the fire curse occasionally stirred, indicating that Old Demon Mu hadn't given up, but could no longer pinpoint his location.</p><p>The storm belt offered no place to rest.</p><p>Though weary, Qin Sang had ample supplies. He slowed down, refining the impurities in his true essence as he flew, wandering aimlessly through the storm.</p><p>This was a rare experience.  Without a powerful cultivator protecting him, experiencing the raw power of nature firsthand, he understood how insignificant he truly was.</p><p>Qin Sang decided against leaving for the time being, lest he run into Old Demon Mu again.</p><p>He would return to the Canglang Sea once the fire curse was removed and the threat eliminated.</p><p>After over half a month in the storm.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly suddenly conveyed a strange sensation. Intrigued, Qin Sang followed its guidance and looked into the distance. Moments later, he abruptly accelerated.</p><p>He skillfully maneuvered, avoiding spiritual tides and hurricanes. After a few flashes, he stopped, staring at the sight before him with a look of surprise.</p><p>A pillar of light stretched from the seabed to the sky.</p><p>Even amidst the chaotic spiritual tides and wind, the light remained clearly visible, albeit slightly distorted.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled seeing a similar scene in the ancient battlefield.</p><p>An ancient restriction had been triggered!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped with joy.  He had been in the storm belt for so long, and this was the first time he had encountered an ancient restriction. It might be a place similar to an ancient cultivator’s cave dwelling.</p><p>He flashed towards the pillar of light, looking down at its source.</p><p>Inside the ancient restriction could be a cave dwelling, but it could also hold unknown dangers.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang decided to try.</p><p>He was utterly exhausted, having pushed himself to the limit. He needed a safe place to rest.</p>
