<h1>Chapter 395: Breakthrough</h1><p>Chapter 395: Breakthrough</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was below the False Core stage, but through his sect's treasured texts and discussions with fellow disciples, he had a general understanding of it.  That's the advantage of being a sect disciple.  Cultivators at the same stage can have vastly different strengths.  Disregarding external aids, in terms of pure cultivation, the differences aren't insurmountable.</p><p>Understanding the consumption rate of his magical treasures, Qin Sang could guess Yu Hua's current state.  A bold plan immediately formed in his mind.</p><p>"Retrieve!"</p><p>Qin Sang controlled his treasure, recalling the Nine Nether Demon Flame, rolled up the Ten Directions Yama Array, summoned the Five Elements Breaking Spell Sword, approached the darkness, took a deep breath, stepped into it, and returned to the side chamber!</p><p>The Sky-Soaring Rakshasa feared the Nine Nether Demon Flame.  Yu Hua had only managed to suppress it with his treasure's power, preventing it from unleashing its full strength.  Yu Hua certainly wouldn't expect him to dare return!</p><p>Qin Sang mentally calculated the time. After a dizzying turn, a barrier appeared before him.  The scene in the side chamber surprised even Qin Sang.</p><p>Yu Hua had somehow used the Nine Nether Demon Flame to create a huge cage of fire, trapping the Sky-Soaring Rakshasa inside.  Within the cage, the Rakshasa's escape techniques seemed ineffective.</p><p>The Rakshasa's fear of the Nine Nether Demon Flame exceeded even Qin Sang's expectations. It roared wildly within the cage, but dared not cross the line.</p><p>However, Yu Hua had paid a heavy price. His right arm was severed at the elbow. The wound wasn't torn by the Rakshasa, but cleanly cut by a sharp weapon.  It was clear Yu Hua had been injured by the Rakshasa, the corpse poison entering his body, forcing him to amputate his own arm.</p><p>Furthermore, Yu Hua's breathing was labored, his energy severely depleted. He stood before the barrier, frantically trying to break the restriction. The barrier was about to open.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared!</p><p>The two stood across the barrier, eyes locked.</p><p>"You dare return?"</p><p>Yu Hua hadn't expected Qin Sang to actually return. Surprise and caution flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a maniacal laugh and suddenly activated the Five Elements Breaking Spell Sword.</p><p>This barrier, like the ice wall on the other side, was primarily for external defense. It seemed the person who set the restriction intended to prevent any stray beasts from damaging the core teleportation array.  Opening it from the inside wasn't difficult, especially as Yu Hua had already partially broken it.  Using Yu Hua's progress, the Five Elements Spirit Sword easily pierced the barrier.</p><p>Yu Hua was taken aback. His first reaction was to retreat.</p><p>But Qin Sang decisively discarded the Five Elements Breaking Spell Sword. With a sweep of his arm, the Ten Directions Yama Array hidden behind him appeared. Its main spirit let out a long howl, black demonic flames surging forth, transforming into a long arrow that shot out.</p><p>Yu Hua's pupils dilated, his face filled with horror.</p><p>"Nine Nether Demon Flame! You…"</p><p>'Whizz!'</p><p>The rushing Nine Nether Demon Flame cut off his words. Yu Hua was terrified, his figure exploding backward. But Qin Sang was too fast; Yu Hua was too close to the barrier, leaving him no room to maneuver.</p><p>Seeing the Nine Nether Demon Flame rapidly enlarging in his vision, Yu Hua was desperate. He could only throw a jade bracelet-shaped artifact.</p><p>The bracelet was a high-quality artifact Yu Hua had kept as a precaution against unexpected incidents during the restriction-breaking process – a sign of his experience.  However, against a magical treasure, it was too weak.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The bracelet was easily shattered by the Nine Nether Demon Flame, but it had fulfilled its purpose, buying Yu Hua a brief respite.</p><p>Yu Hua retreated in disarray.  Aside from using his magical treasures and recalling the Nine Nether Demon Flame to fight Qin Sang, he couldn't think of any other way out.  But recalling the Nine Nether Demon Flame to deal with the immediate threat…</p><p>What about the Sky-Soaring Rakshasa?</p><p>Yu Hua didn't know.</p><p>Qin Sang, understanding the importance of eliminating all threats, pressed his attack. The situation didn't allow Yu Hua to think much; he could only react as he went.</p><p>Yu Hua silently prayed that the Sky-Soaring Rakshasa, lacking intelligence and not being Qin Sang's controlled corpse, wouldn't distinguish between friend and foe...</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Two masses of demonic fire collided.</p><p>Qin Sang trembled violently, gritting his teeth to endure.</p><p>The scene Yu Hua most hoped for didn't happen. The Sky-Soaring Rakshasa's eyes seemed to ignore Qin Sang, fixated only on Yu Hua. It was as if only he was alive in the side chamber!</p><p>"Why?!"</p><p>Yu Hua roared in disbelief, frantically activating his treasure to repel Qin Sang, simultaneously using the demonic flame to narrowly avoid the Sky-Soaring Rakshasa's attack, attempting to escape.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a figure flashed before him—Qin Sang had blocked his escape from the side chamber even faster.</p><p>Yu Hua, greedy for the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid, wouldn't let Qin Sang go.</p><p>Qin Sang relentlessly pursued Yu Hua's death.</p><p>He couldn't afford to miss a chance.  Escape was secondary; opportunity was paramount.  Letting Yu Hua go would not only expose his identity but also ruin decades of work in Xiao Han region and Shao Hua Mountain, potentially forcing him into exile.  The constant threat from a far more powerful cultivator was unbearable.</p><p>Unable to launch a surprise attack, Qin Sang changed tactics, blocking the side chamber entrance – a trap was set.  Flying Night Rakshasa was his most dependable ally, fearless except for the Nine Nether Magic Flame.  Qin Sang had no fear of betrayal.</p><p>Man and corpse – or rather, two 'living corpses' – worked in perfect coordination.  While Qin Sang held off the Nine Nether Magic Flame, Flying Night Rakshasa, finally unleashed, displayed its Golden Core level power, attacking with lightning speed and surprising skill.  Even a fully powered Yu Hua wouldn't stand a chance without artifacts;  exhausted as he was, Yu Hua quickly faltered.</p><p>Yu Hua attempted escape, only to be driven back by the combined assault.</p><p>"You will die!"</p><p>Yu Hua, eyes bloodshot, harbored intense hatred. Facing imminent death, his plans for the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid were irrelevant; survival was his only priority. He decided to awaken the Heart-Eating Insect Gu.</p><p>Then, a look of terror crossed Yu Hua's face.  "You…"</p><p>"I was acting."</p><p>Qin Sang stood unharmed, a chilling smile revealing his teeth, looking demonic in Yu Hua’s eyes.  Startled, Yu Hua exposed a weakness, receiving a devastating blow from Flying Night Rakshasa.  He crashed to the ground, desperately summoning the Nine Nether Magic Flame to repel the pursuing Rakshasa.</p><p>The moment had arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang acted decisively, completely draining his spiritual energy, leaving his energy sea empty, and unleashed the full power of the Nine Nether Magic Flame towards Yu Hua.  Yu Hua struggled to redirect the flame to defend against Qin Sang’s attack, but was too slow. Qin Sang broke through.</p><p>"Aaargh!"</p><p>The Nine Nether Magic Flame, with its unique properties, attacked the soul first. Before visible injury appeared, Yu Hua let out a horrifying scream; his spiritual essence rapidly faded.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes lit up.  He abruptly redirected the Nine Nether Magic Flame, this time to stop Flying Night Rakshasa.</p>
