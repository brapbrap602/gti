<h1></h1><p>Having advanced to the Fourth Transformation, equivalent to the Nascent Soul realm, the Fat Silkworm seemed to have not grasped any new divine abilities, possessing only the ability to ward off poisons.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally thought it would at least be able to wield poison against enemies, gaining a certain level of combat power.</p><p>Even something like the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Heavenly Eye Divine Light could play a crucial role in battles.</p><p>Yet, the Fat Silkworm could only be effective in special environments like the Three Poison Lands of the Seven Kills Hall, or when encountering poison-wielding opponents like the Frogfish.</p><p>How could such a spirit insect survive alone in the perilous world of cultivation?</p><p>Coerced by Qin Sang, the Fat Silkworm spat out several clumps of seven-colored halos, tiring itself out to the point of sticking its tongue out, its eyes glazed over, only able to thicken its poison-resistant carapace.</p><p>Qin Sang helplessly gave up and turned to check on Ya Gu's condition.</p><p>With just one glance, Qin Sang had a feeling that Ya Gu was different.</p><p>But this change wasn't outwardly apparent.</p><p>She was the same as before, cheeks rosy, eyelids tightly closed, breathing evenly, still a sleeping beauty.</p><p>The change stemmed from her divine soul.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly perceive that Ya Gu's divine soul had become more stable.</p><p>It was clearly related to the Fat Silkworm.  The Fat Silkworm's advancement had strengthened the 'anchor,' allowing Ya Gu to cling tightly to the rope connecting her to the light, even when facing the raging storms of darkness.</p><p>Perhaps, there were other reasons Qin Sang didn't know.</p><p>The connection between Ya Gu and the Fat Silkworm was far closer than he had imagined.</p><p>Although Ya Gu couldn't yet respond, her condition had noticeably improved. If it weren't for the incident at the Seven Kills Hall, she would definitely be in better shape now, perhaps even awake.</p><p>Finally, a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed the Fat Silkworm's head. If Ya Gu could be awakened, even if the Fat Silkworm didn't have any divine abilities, raising it wouldn't have been in vain.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Finally free, the Fat Silkworm eagerly burrowed into Ya Gu's brow, falling into a deep slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang remained where he was, not rushing to leave.</p><p>He hadn't strayed too far from the tribulation site, intending to wait and see if any cultivators were alerted by the heavenly tribulation and came to investigate.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's tribulation was an unexpected event, too hasty to avoid attracting attention.</p><p>A Fourth Transformation spirit insect was absolutely rare in the cultivation world. Once news of it spread, it was likely to attract Nascent Soul cultivators seeking to capture it, or even the attention of major sects.</p><p>As Qin Sang predicted,</p><p>Moments later, two streaks of light flew from afar, two male cultivators, one old and one young, appearing like grandfather and grandson, but both possessing considerable cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, the younger cultivator's cultivation was higher, unexpectedly at mid-Gold Core, while the elder was only slightly weaker.</p><p>“Two Gold Core cultivators drawn here so easily. It seems the Immortal Sects in Fudù Prefecture have considerable power…”</p><p>Qin Sang observed their movements, thinking to himself.</p><p>The two headed straight for the tribulation site.</p><p>Although the tribulation clouds had dispersed, the Heavenly Might carried by the tribulation lightning hadn't completely vanished, and Qin Sang couldn't completely erase it.</p><p>The two were quite experienced. Before getting close, they sensed the Heavenly Might and immediately recognized it.</p><p>“Heavenly Tribulation!”</p><p>The two exclaimed in unison, exchanging glances with shocked expressions.</p><p>They had been busy with another matter and hadn't witnessed the tribulation lightning. Sensing the unusual fluctuations of spiritual energy here, they had come to investigate on a whim, never expecting to find someone undergoing a tribulation here.</p><p>It was common knowledge that only Nascent Soul cultivators could trigger heavenly tribulations.</p><p>For a moment, both felt a chill down their spines, regretting their recklessness, instinctively wanting to flee.</p><p>However, they had already seen the scene at the tribulation site.</p><p>Everywhere was scorched black, the mountaintop almost leveled by the tribulation lightning, the entire mountain a scene of devastation, partly due to the tribulation lightning and partly due to Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>The destruction caused by the heavenly tribulation was evident, but the figure of the person undergoing the tribulation was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Recalling the short duration of the thunder,</p><p>Could it be that the mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator had failed the tribulation?</p><p>The two exchanged another look, unable to resist the immense temptation, boldly approaching, searching meticulously, but finding no Nascent Soul remnants, they couldn't help but feel greatly disappointed.</p><p>“Let's quickly report back to Senior Martial Brother Sect Leader. I wonder which Nascent Soul senior was passing through and chose to undergo tribulation here. Let the sect seniors report it to the Six Emptiness Sect, perhaps they can find some clues,” the younger cultivator said.</p><p>The elder stroked his goatee, agreeing, “That's the right course of action. Regardless of that senior's origin, it has nothing to do with us. It's a pity, under the heavenly tribulation, nothing remains!”</p><p>“That senior might not have truly failed the tribulation. Have either of us ever witnessed a true heavenly tribulation?”</p><p>The younger cultivator shook his head, sealing the area around the mountain peak with a formation, beckoning to the elder, and then flew away on his flying light.</p><p>Qin Sang was standing not far from them.</p><p>The two were completely unaware that their conversation had been overheard.</p><p>Confirming that these two hadn't witnessed the silver tribulation lightning and had been misled into believing it was a cultivator's tribulation, Qin Sang decided not to interfere with them, letting them leave.</p><p>News of a Nascent Soul tribulation, while disrupting the situation in Fudù Prefecture, wouldn't spiral out of control, and might not be a bad thing.</p><p>“Six Emptiness Sect…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured the three words, his figure flickering and disappearing.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang returned to Fudù Prefecture and chose an elegant dwelling at the Six Prefectures Hall, waiting for Zhou Jin to arrive.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Zhou Jin arrived as promised.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Zhou Jin was overjoyed, bowing deeply, “Greetings, Senior Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “This old man also didn't expect to be gone for nearly ten years.  You've remained in Fudù Prefecture all these years. Have you discovered anything?”</p><p>Zhou Jin, worried about Ruan Yu's illness and having had no news of Qin Sang for nearly ten years, feared that the senior had met with an accident or had forgotten the matter, living in constant anxiety, yet not daring to slack off.</p><p>Fortunately, his worst fears hadn't materialized.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, Zhou Jin spoke rapidly, “This junior followed Senior's instructions. After leaving Ze Prefecture, I rushed to this area to investigate information about Mount Pú and the Xie Family…”</p><p>Mount Pú, the Xie Family.</p><p>Related to the superior cultivation sanctuary recorded by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>The sanctuary was called the Clear Void Illusion Realm, and it was located on Mount Pú.</p><p>The Xie Family once boasted two Nascent Soul cultivators, holding a prominent position even in Zhong Prefecture, which was teeming with experts. The Clear Void Illusion Realm was extremely well-hidden, always controlled by the Xie Family, unknown to outsiders.</p><p>The Clear Void Illusion Realm not only served as a cave dwelling, but also held other secrets.</p><p>Generations of Xie Family descendants painstakingly researched, but were unable to unlock the secret until one of the Xie Family Nascent Soul cultivators met Xiao Xiangzi. Seeing his unique divine abilities, they invited him into the Clear Void Illusion Realm, and finally the secret was cracked.</p><p>What benefits the three obtained within the Clear Void Illusion Realm, the jade slip didn't record in detail.</p><p>What was lamentable was that precisely at the moment of cracking the secret, preparing to divide the treasures equally, the Xie Family ancestor, blinded by greed, attempted to kill Xiao Xiangzi and seize all the treasures for himself.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi certainly hadn't reached the Deity Transformation realm at that time, otherwise the Xie Family ancestor wouldn't have been so foolish.</p><p>Even so, both Xie Family Nascent Soul cultivators were ultimately slain by Xiao Xiangzi in retaliation.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't exterminate the entire Xie Family, but in his fury, he wasn't willing to let them off so easily either. He personally sealed the Clear Void Illusion Realm, preventing future Xie Family descendants from entering.</p><p>Cooperation and betrayal occurred constantly in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>Nor did Xiao Xiangzi think his actions were inappropriate.</p><p>This betrayal ignited Xiao Xiangzi's killing intent, nearly driving him to slaughter the entire Xie Family, pushing him to the brink of demonic possession. It was this incident that jolted him awake, making him realize the influence of his inner demons.</p><p>His subsequent travels, refining Soul Calming Incense, and promptly addressing the hidden danger allowed him the opportunity to advance to Deity Transformation.</p><p>However, when he later reflected on his past cultivation journey, he realized that the other Xie Family Nascent Soul cultivator initially hadn't intended to betray him, but was coerced by the Xie Family ancestor and had no choice but to comply.</p><p>Since they had chosen to attack him, regardless of their true intentions, Xiao Xiangzi couldn't show mercy.</p><p>Nevertheless, the rage brought about by the betrayal had subsided considerably.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi recorded this matter, requesting that whoever obtained the jade slip travel to Zhong Prefecture and find the Xie Family. If the Clear Void Illusion Realm's restrictions were still in place, they were to open it and return it to the Xie Family, settling this karmic debt.</p><p>Qin Sang dispatched Zhou Jin to search for the Xie Family.</p><p>Firstly, to fulfill Xiao Xiangzi's entrustment, and secondly, he could also cultivate in the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>Time changed everything, place names shifted, powers rose and fell. Just like the destroyed cave dwelling in the Sky Rift Valley and the renamed Zhúlán Temple, even if the Xie Family no longer existed and the Clear Void Illusion Realm had a new owner, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>“After arriving here, this junior traveled throughout Fudù Prefecture and the three surrounding prefectures, but couldn't find Mount Pú.  Later, I learned that after Zhuō Prefecture was incorporated into the Nineteen Prefectures of Misty Rain, Mount Bùniàn had spearheaded a large-scale geomantic survey, dividing Zhuō Prefecture into various prefectures and changing many place names. This junior then sought to collect ancient texts…”</p><p>Zhou Jin's tone was light, clearly indicating a discovery. “Three years ago, this junior finally found the words ‘Mount Pú’ in an ancient text. After much verification, I confirmed that Mount Pú is located within Fudù Prefecture, and it's the present-day Mount Luóyān! However, the master of Mount Luóyān is no longer the Xie Family, but the Luóyān Sect.”</p><p>“Luóyān Sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. “Do the cultivators of this sect wear jade pendants engraved with the character ‘Luó’ at their waists?”</p><p>The two individuals attracted by the Fat Silkworm's tribulation had worn such jade pendants.</p><p>Mount Pú had indeed changed hands, but it was unknown whether the Luóyān Sect had discovered the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>“Has Senior met disciples of the Luóyān Sect?”</p><p>Zhou Jin nodded. “The Luóyān Sect has numerous experts. This junior didn't dare to act openly, only investigating the relationship between the Luóyān Sect and the Xie Family in secret. Later, I discovered that Mount Luóyān was seized from the Xie Family by the Luóyān Sect, and the Xie Family was forced to relocate from Mount Pú, their clan now in decline.”</p><p>With the fall of their two Nascent Soul ancestors and the loss of the Clear Void Illusion Realm, the Xie Family lost the foundation of their prosperity, declining from their peak.</p><p>To have survived to this day, their bloodline unbroken, was remarkably difficult, owing to the stability of the Zhong Prefecture region.</p><p>Upon learning of the Xie Family's whereabouts, Zhou Jin immediately found them.</p><p>Now, the Xie Family had been reduced to an ordinary cultivation family, their current clan leader only at the Foundation Establishment realm.  Their ancestral land on Mount Pú had been seized, its name even changed, and they dared not utter a word of protest.</p><p>“This junior deliberately approached the Xie Family and learned one thing,” Zhou Jin paused. “Back then, when the Xie Family relinquished Mount Pú, they made a deal with the Luóyān Sect. Now, the agreed-upon time has long passed, and the Luóyān Sect shows no intention of returning it. If Senior wishes to help the Xie Family reclaim Mount Pú, you could start from here.”</p><p>Zhou Jin now mistakenly believed Qin Sang to be a descendant of the Xie Family, returning to their ancestral land to seek justice for his clan.</p><p>“Is the Luóyān Sect very powerful?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>Listening to Zhou Jin's tone, it seemed he couldn't force the Luóyān Sect to comply and return Mount Pú to the Xie Family through sheer cultivation strength.</p><p>Zhou Jin respectfully replied, “The Luóyān Sect's leader is only at late-Gold Core. Senior could easily annihilate them. However, there's another matter to be wary of: the Luóyān Sect is backed by the Six Emptiness Sect.  The transaction between the Luóyān Sect and the Xie Family was witnessed by someone sent by the Six Emptiness Sect.  This junior has been investigating the connection between them and discovered that the Luóyān Sect leader has a close relationship with the Six Emptiness Sect. The Six Emptiness Sect has three Nascent Soul elders and wields considerable power, dominating the surrounding prefectures. Even Mount Bùniàn has difficulty interfering, and the Prefecture Governor of Fudù Prefecture can't control matters outside the prefectural city.”</p><p>Zhou Jin had been diligent, even investigating the difficulties Qin Sang would face.</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>Qin Sang was quite satisfied with Zhou Jin, praising him, and honoring his promise, took out the jade slip containing the medicinal formula and a jade box.</p><p>Zhou Jin was ecstatic, hurriedly taking them with both hands.  Opening the jade box, he saw a spiritual herb inside and looked up in astonishment.</p><p>“This Black Essence Grass is the main ingredient of the formula. This old man discovered it by chance in the Western Desert.  This herb is precious.  If you searched for it yourself, it would take at least ten years, potentially delaying the treatment.”</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, looking at Zhou Jin, “This old man is currently short-handed. If you're willing, you can bring Ruan Yu along to Mount Pú for cultivation.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior!”</p><p>Zhou Jin knelt and kowtowed, expressing his heartfelt gratitude.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired about the details from Zhou Jin, pondering his subsequent plan.</p><p>If it were only the Luóyān Sect, he could simply visit them and drive them down the mountain, minimizing the impact. Now that the Six Emptiness Sect was involved, careful planning was necessary.</p><p>Of the three Nascent Soul cultivators in the Six Emptiness Sect, only one was at mid-Nascent Soul.</p><p>Bringing his avatar and storming in would be satisfying, but he had to consider the subsequent repercussions.</p><p>In Zhong Prefecture, regardless of one's cultivation level, one couldn't act recklessly.</p><p>Moreover, it was unclear whether the Clear Void Illusion Realm had been exposed.  If it involved a dispute over the sanctuary, matters would become even more complicated.</p><p>After some thought,</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Zhou Jin to take him to the Xie Family first.</p><p>…</p><p>Driven from Mount Pú by the Luóyān Sect, the Xie Family was unable to secure good spiritual veins, settling for a location with inferior spiritual energy.</p><p>This further accelerated the Xie Family's decline, their accumulated resources nearly depleted. To this day, even their clan leader hadn't broken through to the Gold Core realm, remaining stuck at the Pseudo-Gold Core stage.</p><p>However, thanks to their former foundation, the Xie Family's protective formation was still quite powerful.</p><p>“Clan Leader Xie, an old friend has come to visit.”</p><p>Arriving before the Xie Family's fortress, Zhou Jin channeled his true essence, calling out loudly.</p><p>The voice carried into the Xie Family compound.</p><p>Soon, the mist parted on both sides, and a figure emerged, Xie An, the Xie Family's Clan Leader, possessing a rather distinguished air.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Zhou, what a rare guest, what a rare guest,” Xie An strode forward, extremely enthusiastic.  Seeing Qin Sang beside Zhou Jin, whose cultivation he couldn't fathom, his heart skipped a beat. “This Fellow Daoist is?”</p><p>Zhou Jin coughed, saying, “This is Senior Qin.”</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Xie An was stunned.</p><p>Zhou Jin was a Gold Core cultivator. The senior he spoke of, could it be…</p>
