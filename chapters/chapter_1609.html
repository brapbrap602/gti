<h1>Chapter 1600: Blood Crocodile Bone Hand</h1><p>Shen Chen was obedient, following Qin Sang closely after the apprenticeship ceremony, behaving like a devoted disciple.</p><p>They returned to the Six States Hall.</p><p>Jiang Mu dismissed his attendants, and Qin Sang had Shen Chen guard the door.</p><p>“I have a matter I’ve been unclear about, Daoist Friend.  Might you enlighten me?”</p><p>Jiang Mu personally served fragrant tea.</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip. “Daoist Friend Jiang, you mean the meteorite fragments? I wonder if you are asking for yourself, or for someone else?”</p><p>Jiang Mu’s gaze sharpened slightly. “If it’s for someone else, then what?”</p><p>“These meteorite fragments relate to a secret. Unfortunately, the clues have been broken, and I am alone and thinly spread, unable to spare myself for it.  However, though this secret is important, I have no intention of keeping it to myself. I wouldn't mind finding a powerful faction to cooperate with.”</p><p>Qin Sang essentially made it clear.</p><p>In the future, if the Ascension Platform could be found, it would require extensive preparation to activate.</p><p>He couldn't act like the Jade Bone Fiend or Ye Lao Mo, slaughtering Yuan Ying cultivators in Central State to refine blood infants. With Bai's guidance, he could choose other methods, but it would require vast resources.</p><p>Finding collaborators was a necessity.</p><p>The Six States Hall was a good choice, but Jiang Mu's status and cultivation were slightly lacking.</p><p>Jiang Mu was silent for a moment, then said: “Ten years ago, Hall Master Mu personally visited Feiyun Ferry, intending to visit you. He learned that Daoist Friend Qin was in seclusion, so he didn't disturb you. I will have someone contact the main hall immediately.”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang stayed at the Six States Hall.</p><p>As night fell, Jiang Mu brought in an elderly man with a rosy complexion, full temples, and a youthful appearance – the Six States Hall's Hall Master, Mu Tongshu.</p><p>Mu Tongshu had a kind face, lacking the imposing air of a great cultivator. He looked more like a prosperous merchant, and he didn't try to hide his cultivation in front of Qin Sang. He was indeed a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>“My apologies for being late, Daoist Friend Qin,” Mu Tongshu greeted with a smile before speaking.</p><p>Jiang Mu proactively exited and closed the quiet room's door.</p><p>“Greetings, Hall Master Mu.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the greeting.</p><p>The Six States Hall's Hall Master was truly a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>Even after seeing it with his own eyes, Qin Sang was still quite surprised.</p><p>This person hadn't appeared at the Easy Treasure Gathering, using other means to create the pressure of a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>In Qin Sang's understanding, large trading houses in the cultivation world were intricately connected to sects, essentially acting as their appendages, or even established by disciples at the sect's behest.</p><p>Central State was no exception.</p><p>A Grand Cultivator, as a sect's top combat power, wouldn't personally handle such matters.</p><p>The managers of the trading houses were, at best, mid-Yuan Ying elders of sects whose paths were closed, using their remaining years, such as the Seven Fragrances Pavilion's pavilion master.</p><p>Qin Sang had investigated before, but found no information on the Six States Hall's backing.</p><p>Now it seemed that with this Hall Master in charge, the Six States Hall didn't need to rely on a sect.</p><p>“Perhaps you find it strange that I guard a small trading house, so lacking in ambition?” Mu Tongshu guessed Qin Sang's thoughts, speaking with a self-deprecating tone.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “The Six States Hall is no small trading house. Moreover, people have their own aspirations. I am a lone wanderer, even more so than Hall Master Mu.”</p><p>“That's because you are a person of the Dao, without attachments, your heart holding only the immortal path!”</p><p>Mu Tongshu seemed to recall something, his face showing emotion.  “In my youth, the old Hall Master brought me into the Six States Hall and accepted me as a disciple, leading to my present state. I can't bear to abandon this attachment.”</p><p>The two sat facing each other.</p><p>Neither was in a hurry to get to the point.</p><p>After some pleasantries…</p><p>Qin Sang indirectly inquired about the Six States Hall's background.</p><p>Mu Tongshu frankly stated: “Daoist Friend, you can consider the Six States Hall a sect, just one that uses commerce as its foundation, without a grand mountain gate. Managing a trading house in the Central Plains is not easy, especially if we don't want to be someone else's subordinate. Fortunately, various factions maintain a balance, and our hall can survive in the cracks, though we often have to navigate carefully and endure pressure from various sides. Only after I broke through to the late Yuan Ying stage did our situation improve.”</p><p>In other words, the Six States Hall did not depend on any forces.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. The Six States Hall's ability to maintain independence and develop such a large influence showed the effort invested by generations of Hall Masters.</p><p>This was thanks to the complex yet stable environment of the Central Plains cultivation world.</p><p>Various factions needed such a neutral trading house, free from excessive interference, so they tacitly allowed the Six States Hall's existence.</p><p>Qin Sang played with the jade cup in his hand, then said:  “Hall Master Mu must already know the reason. To be frank, the reason I've gone to such lengths is because the meteorite fragments may involve the secret of ascension.”</p><p>“Ascension?”</p><p>Mu Tongshu’s pupils constricted, his face showing doubt. “Could this treasure be related to the Eight Scenery Pavilion and the Ganlu Chan Monastery?”</p><p>Although cultivators in Central State didn't know the truth about 'ascension', they knew a public secret.</p><p>After reaching the peak of their cultivation at the Transcendence stage, cultivators would visit these two great immortal sects.</p><p>Therefore, when Qin Sang mentioned ascension, Mu Tongshu immediately connected it to them.</p><p>Liuzhou Hall's headquarters are located in Tianzhong County, nestled between two major Immortal Sects. Mu Tongshu possesses more detailed knowledge of the situation.</p><p>Those Nascent Soul cultivators likely reached some sort of agreement with the two major Immortal Sects. After leaving the Sects, they rarely interfere in the cultivation world's affairs.</p><p>The outside world suspects that the two major Immortal Sects used the method of ascension as leverage to secure the cooperation of other Nascent Soul cultivators, thereby maintaining their dominant positions.</p><p>“Not so!”</p><p>Qin Sang stated his conclusion, drawn from years of contemplation,  “The Immortal and Buddhist sects might know the truth about ‘ascension,’ but they don't reveal it to us Yuan Ying cultivators. Assuming ‘ascension’ is real, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Immortal and Buddhist sects need to deter others and maintain their dominance.  Their continued presence in this world is understandable.  However, throughout history, many Nascent Soul cultivators, like Old Demon Lu, lived solitary lives, with no interest in building power.  Why did they remain in this world and cultivate in seclusion for such a long time?  Presumably, ascension is not an easy feat even for Nascent Soul cultivators.  Furthermore, what if the two major Immortal Sects are secretly manipulating something? How can we guard against that?”</p><p>Mu Tongshu's expression turned shocked. “You know of another method of ascension?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and sighed lightly, “To be frank, I don't have much certainty either. Otherwise, the truth of ‘ascension’ wouldn't remain in their hands. But even a one in ten thousand chance is worth trying.”</p><p>He temporarily decided not to reveal to Mu Tongshu that late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators have the potential to ascend using the Ascension Platform.</p><p>If Mu Tongshu proves unreliable, betraying him or leaking the information, the situation could spiral out of control.</p><p>No one knows how many times the Ascension Platform can be used.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that other Ascension Platforms might be like the one in Ziwei Palace—destroyed after a single use.</p><p>“Ascension…”</p><p>Mu Tongshu was lost in thought.</p><p>For powerful cultivators like them, ascension remains a distant prospect, due to the formidable Nascent Soul tribulation. But as Qin Sang said, even the slightest glimmer of hope is worth pursuing.</p><p>One step at a time.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t use it, it could benefit future generations.</p><p>But how could he be sure Qin Sang’s words were true?</p><p>Mu Tongshu spoke frankly, voicing his doubts.</p><p>Qin Sang spread his hands, stating confidently, “Whether you believe me or not, I have no proof!  It's too early to discuss ascension. First, we need to investigate the origin of the meteorite fragments, whether similar treasures exist in the cultivation world, and their origins… Your Hall's branches are widespread throughout the Central Plains, and your information network is excellent;  it won't cost much.”</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Mu Tongshu suddenly said, “Would our Hall be honored to invite Daoist Qin to be a guest elder?”</p><p>“I would be delighted.”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Liuzhou Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang and Hall Master Mu bid each other farewell.</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned Shen Chen.  “What cultivation technique are you practicing?”</p><p>“Reporting to Master, it’s the Metal-elemental technique, ‘Yao Guang Jue.’”</p><p>Shen Chen immediately produced a jade slip and presented it to Qin Sang with both hands.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly reviewed it.</p><p>‘Yao Guang Jue’ is not a top-tier technique, but several of its accompanying divine abilities are helpful in refining weapons. In a sense, it’s quite suitable for Shen Chen.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed superior techniques, but after considering the matter, he decided to let Shen Chen continue cultivating ‘Yao Guang Jue’ for now. He would consider switching techniques after Shen Chen reached the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Changing techniques requires significant effort and can impact cultivation progress.</p><p>Qin Sang's technique is different, but given his insights, he could easily provide guidance to Shen Chen. After some thought, he added numerous annotations to the jade slip before returning it to Shen Chen.</p><p>“From now on, focus on your cultivation and strive to improve your cultivation base. Don't get distracted by weapon refining for the time being, but don't neglect it entirely. Take these pills as needed.”</p><p>Qin Sang took out several jade bottles from his storage ring, along with some weapon refining manuals he had collected, and gave them to Shen Chen.</p><p>The pills were recently purchased from Liuzhou Hall. The remnants from the crocodile demon were more than enough, and Liuzhou Hall even gave him a discount.</p><p>Being a guest elder has its perks.</p><p>Shen Chen received everything.</p><p>Besides his surprise, he finally understood.</p><p>His master didn't take him on as a disciple without reason. Judging by his master's tone, his current cultivation level is too low; he would be useful only after becoming a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>Yuan Ying, which Shen Chen had only dared to dream of before, seemed achievable now with his new master.</p><p>Shen Chen, having spent many years in the cultivation world, felt no discomfort.</p><p>There’s no such thing as free kindness.</p><p>The worst thing is to be useless!</p><p>Moreover, his master valued his weapon-refining talent, not his life.</p><p>Regardless of Shen Chen's thoughts, Qin Sang raised his hand and pointed between his eyebrows.</p><p>Shen Chen felt a moment of disorientation, and a fragment of a powerful array suddenly appeared in his mind. Currently, he could only see a small part, but he sensed that the array was incredibly complex – unlike anything he'd ever encountered.</p><p>“This is a part of a complete spiritual array. Remember what your master said earlier – you can only study it, don't rashly attempt to activate it!” Qin Sang said sternly.</p><p>Shen Chen quickly pulled himself together, his manner respectful and apprehensive.  "Disciple obeys!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Forcing Shen Chen to the Yuan Ying stage might have made him, like the strange-faced man's disciple, lack experience, his abilities not matching his cultivation level.</p><p>However, Shen Chen was unlike Bai Hanqiu and Mei Gu; he had no prior connection with Qin Sang, and there were no feelings between them.</p><p>Qin Sang's decision to take him on as a disciple was mainly due to his talent in refining artifacts; his combat ability was unimportant, quite different from a chosen successor.</p><p>After giving a few more instructions, Qin Sang initially wanted to send Shen Chen away, but then thought better of it.  "Stay here," she said. "Master is going to refine something. You can observe, no need to try to understand everything right away; just remember what you see."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Shen Chen huddled in a corner, both excited and expectant. This was the first time he had witnessed a Yuan Ying cultivator refining an artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang touched her storage ring; a demon core appeared in her palm, the core of the crocodile demon.</p><p>The first crocodile demon had been killed by the Sunbird, leaving only remnants; its spirit and core were destroyed.  The second crocodile demon's core, however, was intact.</p><p>After soul searching, the crocodile demon's spirit dissipated; the core was pure, devoid of the demon's essence.</p><p>Shen Chen was mesmerized.</p><p>"The core of a transformed demon!"</p><p>Shen Chen was astonished, his understanding of his new master's strength greatly enhanced.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the core in her hand.</p><p>After killing the crocodile demon and obtaining its bone, Qin Sang had been considering how to use it. The bone could summon a gigantic crocodile, a formidable power; if she could utilize it, she would gain a powerful new weapon.</p><p>However, she wasn't a demon, and lacked the crocodile's bloodline, unable to subdue the bone.</p><p>She lacked the bloodline, but she had the corpse and the core. The demon had previously cultivated the bone, and it recognized the demon's essence.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to use this to deceive the bone.  For ten years, she had cultivated and planned, finally devising a solution.</p><p>Core in hand, a black flame suddenly appeared in Qin Sang's palm. The demonic fire's aura was extremely violent, yet in Qin Sang's control, it seemed docile.</p><p>Shen Chen's eyes widened as he watched the demonic fire, swallowing hard; he felt both fear and envy.</p><p>He felt the fire could easily kill him.</p><p>If only he could control such terrifying flames like his master.</p><p>The demonic fire enveloped the core.</p><p>The flames were surprisingly gentle.</p><p>The core began to soften, its perfectly round shape collapsing into an oval, until it finally became a thin sheet.</p><p>Cultivators usually use demon cores for alchemy.</p><p>This was the first time Shen Chen had seen a transformed demon's core used in artifact refinement.  He forgot his earlier distractions, completely focusing on Qin Sang's movements.</p><p>In Shen Chen's view, the demonic fire pulsed rhythmically several times. Qin Sang produced several rare materials, casting runes he couldn't comprehend, transforming the core.  Finally, it became a transparent glove.</p><p>Each step was smooth and effortless, captivating him.</p><p>However, Shen Chen didn't understand the glove's power; it didn't seem like a magical treasure, leaving him puzzled.</p><p>After the glove was formed, Qin Sang took out a small jade bottle.</p><p>It contained a bright red liquid, pure as a ruby, the essence extracted from the crocodile demon's corpse.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The bottle opened, and the essence flew out, hovering above the glove.</p><p>Qin Sang's fingers moved with precision, drawing a thread from the essence, like embroidery, weaving a blood-red hand that slowly descended, merging with the transparent glove.</p><p>Suddenly, a bloody light erupted.</p><p>Shen Chen gazed intently, seeing a blood-red glove suspended within the light, extremely thin, scarlet as blood, emanating a terrifying and ferocious aura, as if a great demon had been reborn!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The blood glove flew to Qin Sang's left hand, its aura and light receding, becoming transparent, soft as air.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the crocodile bone, gripping it in her left hand, removing the demonic fire seal.</p><p>The bone struggled again.</p><p>But this time was different. As soon as Qin Sang activated the blood glove, the bone gradually calmed down.</p><p>"It's done!"</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted.</p><p>While it had consumed a transformed demon's core and essence to create only a tool to control the bone, it was worth it.</p><p>"From now on, you shall be called the Blood Crocodile Hand!"</p>
