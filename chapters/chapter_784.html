<h1>Chapter 776: Encounter</h1><p>Chapter 776: Encounter</p><p>Adult red-tailed cranes were guarding the nest.</p><p>Qin Sang silently climbed, approaching the nest.</p><p>The guarding crane stood at the edge of the crevice, watching the chase below. Sensing something, it turned its head towards Qin Sang's hiding place.</p><p>Qin Sang, knowing the crane's keen senses, knew he was exposed. He immediately activated a talisman and rushed towards the crevice at top speed.</p><p>The escaping light rapidly magnified in the crane's eyes.</p><p>The crane raised its neck, screamed, and spread its wings.  Just as it flew out of the crevice, a black fireball flew towards it.</p><p>The fireball's aura terrified it.</p><p>In a hurry, the crane swung its long tail. Its tail, like a burning fan, emitted a dazzling red light, striking fiercely.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire erupted.</p><p>The crane screamed, flung away, its red tail mostly burned by the fire, leaving it a pathetic sight.</p><p>However, despite its appearance, the crane wasn't severely injured. It quickly stabilized itself.  But as it tried to stop Qin Sang again, it found the escaping light too fast; in the brief moment, Qin Sang had already entered the nest.</p><p>The crane shrieked repeatedly.</p><p>On the ground,</p><p>the two-headed creature was fleeing in panic, continuously creating illusions to distract the cranes. Even so, it had several claw marks on its back, chased relentlessly by the crane.</p><p>Finally reaching the river valley, it jumped into the water without hesitation.</p><p>At that moment, the crane, discovering the nest's invasion, flew into a rage, abandoning the two-headed creature and charging towards the nest.</p><p>Qin Sang, having entered the nest, sensed this and felt a chill.</p><p>If trapped in the nest by the crane, his escape techniques would be useless.</p><p>He saw the baby cranes knocked over by the aftershock of the Nine Nether Demon Fire.  Ignoring them, he quickly moved to an ancient vine, surprisingly smoothly.</p><p>The vine clung to the rocks, its top hanging down, with a cluster of fruits.</p><p>Five had turned red, nearing maturity. The others were green and clearly lacked medicinal properties. Qin Sang quickly took out a jade box, picked the five red fruits, and ran.</p><p>Even the baby cranes were enraged, but their strength was too weak to stop him.</p><p>Qin Sang used the same tactic, again repelling the guarding crane with the Nine Nether Demon Fire.  He flew out of the crevice. Seeing the adult cranes pursuing him, he didn't hesitate, immediately using his escape technique to dash deep into the mountains.</p><p>For a time, the mountain echoed with the angry cries of the cranes.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look back. A group of cranes chased him, and he quickly crossed two mountains.</p><p>The speed difference was evident. Even the leader of the cranes, frantically flapping its wings, couldn’t catch up and was gradually left behind.</p><p>Qin Sang had already observed his escape route.  Crossing the third peak, the moment he was out of the cranes' sight, he changed direction, jumped into a ravine, and submerged himself, using the river to conceal his presence.</p><p>The cranes, having lost their target, were furious, wreaking havoc in the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang had already drifted to the lower reaches of the river, and at a confluence, sensed the two-headed creature.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Water splashed as Qin Sang surfaced from the river's center. He saw the two-headed creature licking its wounds.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the two-headed creature perked up, jumped onto the bank, looking at him expectantly, while remaining vigilant about the direction Qin Sang came from.</p><p>"You still don't trust my speed?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the bank, a flash of light evaporating the water from his body.</p><p>This fruit theft was unexpectedly smooth.</p><p>Fortunately, there weren't many cranes, their flight speed wasn't fast, and there were no other ferocious beasts nearby. Otherwise, even with Qin Sang's speed, being chased for too long would have certainly alarmed other beasts, leading to a dangerous siege.</p><p>The two-headed creature looked expectantly at the jade box.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the jade box, pointing to one fruit, said unhappily: "Don't look, this one's yours! If you're not reassured, add your own enchantment."</p><p>Unexpectedly, the two-headed creature’s eyes flashed, and it actually blew a gust of green wind at the fruit, forming a green ring.</p><p>“You actually dare…”</p><p>Qin Sang glared at it fiercely. The two-headed creature shrank to the side, its tail tucked in, wearing a sheepish grin.</p><p>The spirit fruit rested in the jade box.  Once removed from the dark crevice, more details became apparent.  Its red skin seemed to have streaks of blood running through it.</p><p>Among the five spirit fruits, some had dense streaks, while others were sparse, indicating different levels of ripeness.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fruit had no scent whatsoever.  Perhaps it wasn't fully mature.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the books and ancient texts he’d seen, but he couldn't remember any similar spirit fruit, nor had he ever heard of the vine it grew on.</p><p>He'd have to investigate further. He wouldn't dare consume it before understanding its properties.</p><p>Putting away the jade box, Qin Sang altered his course, continuing towards the Sky Tower.</p><p>He had just crossed several mountains when he suddenly stopped, frowning at the valley to his left.</p><p>The valley was lush with green grass, and the surrounding forests had grown so dense they almost completely concealed it.  Qin Sang only noticed the valley’s existence upon arrival.</p><p>Several huts stood within the valley.</p><p>These huts clearly dated back to ancient times.  They were enveloped by a shimmering barrier, likely a spirit formation of some kind.  Protected by this barrier, the huts showed no signs of decay.</p><p>Two individuals stood before the huts, watching Qin Sang warily.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed they were holding strange wooden spindles, seemingly attempting to break the spirit formation. Their efforts were producing subtle ripples in the barrier.</p><p>Their initial delight at this progress turned to surprise and alertness when they noticed Qin Sang’s presence.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang’s cultivation level, a glint of malice flashed in their eyes.  However, upon sensing the aura of the two-headed creature, they were stunned, utterly astonished.</p><p>To command such a powerful beast… could this person be hiding their true cultivation level?</p><p>The two clearly took Qin Sang for a powerful cultivator disguising their strength.</p><p>“One at the late Nascent Soul stage, the other slightly weaker than Cui Ji – both formidable opponents.”</p><p>Qin Sang assessed their cultivation levels, keenly aware of the shift in their expressions.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang continued towards the Sky Tower with the two-headed creature.</p><p>If they tried to kill him, he wouldn't let them get away with it.</p><p>The huts' location suggested they'd been searched countless times. Whether any treasures remained was unknown.  He wouldn't take the initiative to attack and risk complications. Unless he used the fire pearl, even driving them away would take considerable time.</p><p>They remained locked in a tense standoff until they were out of each other's sight, neither side making a move.  A battle never ensued.</p>
