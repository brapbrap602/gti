Chapter 246: Thousand Illusions Divine Melody


Old Devil Di Que might have been unsure of the Flaming Flying Monkeys' capabilities, unwilling to personally risk himself and instead sending him, Qin Sang, to scout the way. Qin Sang had anticipated Di Queâ€™s intentions early on and cried out upon hearing them, "Senior, you may not know this, but those Flaming Flying Monkeys possess Fiery Golden Eyes capable of seeing through stealth techniques. They are also able to transform flames into cudgels, possessing unyielding strength, adept at close quarters combat with matchless power, and capable of forming coordinated attacks against enemies. If this junior were to charge into their midst, in less than a moment I would be torn to mincemeat."
"Oh?"
Startled, Old Devil Di Que glanced over, "You've tested their strength firsthand?"
Qin Sang shook his head, "During the trials, this junior had encountered such flying monkeys, learning of their capabilities. However, the flying monkeys of the trial grounds were vastly weaker than these, which allowed this junior to pass the trial by a stroke of luck."
It seemed that Old Devil Di Que was genuinely unaware of the Flaming Flying Monkeys' abilities. The trials experienced by a Golden Core and Foundation Establishment cultivator were vastly different.
Old Devil Di Que shot a profound glance at Qin Sang, muttering, "Since Brother Qin is so familiar with them, all the better. It seems my request for your assistance was correct. As for the flying monkeys' strength, you need not worry. This old one has already made arrangements, so you will not be facing them alone."
This old man was clearly suspicious, likely only believing half of what he said.
Inwardly, Qin Sang cursed. His earlier words were true, but he had downplayed the monkeys' ability to merge with one another, causing their strength to skyrocket.
He had naturally hoped that Old Devil Di Que would be caught off guard, surrounded by flying monkeys while he took the opportunity to escape.
But Di Que would not fall for it.
Seeing that he could not escape his fate as a scout, Qin Sang grew anxious, but could only accept it begrudgingly, waiting for an opportunity to free himself.
"I wonder what Senior needs this junior to do?"
Before his words had finished, the light before Qin Sang's eyes suddenly dimmed, and Old Devil Di Que's finger shot towards his brow like lightning.
Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, suppressing his instinct to dodge with great effort, standing still without moving, allowing Old Devil Di Que to point his finger at his brow.
A strange energy flowed through his brow and into his body.
Just as Qin Sang was secretly frowning, secretly analyzing the nature of this energy...
"Brother Qin's will is quite strong!"
Old Devil Di Que spoke with a hint of admiration, or perhaps mockery, before changing tone to explain to Qin Sang, "Hidden within this energy is this old one's Thousand Illusions Divine Melody. From now on, you will have complete control over it. After entering the monkey horde, if you encounter a flying monkey's attack, you can use your spiritual sense to control the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody and defend yourself. Do not worry about your safety, this old one will be waiting outside to assist you."
As he listened to Old Devil Di Que's words, Qin Sang discovered that the strange energy had entered his soul space, surrounding his soul.
Through his soul, Qin Sang could sense incoherent whispers from this energy, capable of bewitching hearts and minds. It should be the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody that the old devil had mentioned.
Since Old Devil Di Que had voluntarily entrusted the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody to Qin Sang, Qin Sang discovered that he could control this energy without hindrance by simply thinking about it.
Qin Sang recalled the first time he had met Old Devil Di Que, when he had used sound waves to attack the black hole. It was clear that his Thousand Illusions Divine Melody was a rare sonic divine ability.
Sonic divine abilities were incredibly mysterious, likely possessing many strange capabilities.
However, Qin Sang was merely a user, knowing only the effects and not the cause. All he could do was treat the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody as a weapon, using the sound waves to resist the flying monkeys' attacks.
At the same time, Qin Sang discovered that a strand of the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody was closely attached to his soul, bearing a hidden warning.
If he attempted to resist, Old Devil Di Que only needed to think about it, and this strand of the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody could immediately transform into a sword or blade, shattering his soul.
This caused Qin Sang to secretly heave a sigh of relief. In this unfortunate situation, the good news was that Old Devil Di Que's hidden hand was not targeting his physical body, and he feared threats to his soul the least.
If an opportunity to escape presented itself, he would certainly not sit and wait for death, but for now he would obediently listen. Fortunately, the old devil was not sending him to die.
After all, if he were easily killed by the flying monkeys, Di Que would not be able to test anything.
"Brother Qin, have you familiarized yourself with this old one's Thousand Illusions Divine Melody?"
Old Devil Di Que casually stood to the side, seemingly unguarded as he looked towards the center of the magma lake.
Qin Sang had no intention of using the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody to attack Old Devil Di Que. The Thousand Illusions Divine Melody was merely lent to him, its true master still being Di Que.

"This junior is already familiar with it."

Elder Void Depletion fully let go of control and Qin Sang can easily control the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody. After trying it, it was very easy to use, and he formed the sound waves into various weapons, both for offense and defense.

"However, those flying monkeys are very strong. Even senior would have trouble going in personally. This junior is worried he won't get to the Red Metal Vine before his Thousand Illusions Divine Melody wears out.

Elder Void Depletion glanced at Qin Sang and said calmly, "You just need to do your best to persevere for a while longer, this old man has his own arrangements."

Not knowing what the old ghost was planning, and pressured by Elder Void Depletion's gaze, Qin Sang can only follow the order. He lifted his feet and walked toward the lava lake.

The bank of the lava lake isn't very wide. Qin Sang walked down the stone steps and didn't take many steps before he was found out by the fiery flying monkeys at the edge of the lava lake.

At this time, Qin Sang activated the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody, forming a screen to hide his body, but he still wasn't able to fool the fiery flying monkeys' Fiery Golden Pupils.

"Ji ji..."

Along with two piercing screams, the lava lake suddenly became chaotic.

In an instant, all the surrounding fiery flying monkeys were disturbed, and this chaos spread into the lava lake at an astonishing speed. A dark red wall instantly formed before Qin Sang. It was covered in densely packed fiery flying monkeys, who stared at Qin Sang with exceptionally fierce eyes, screaming shrilly.

As expected, there are unknown restrictions here, restraining them.

Qin Sang prayed in his heart that these restrictions would also hinder him, and then he activated the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody with all his might to protect his body. He gritted his teeth and, like lightning, rushed into the group of monkeys.

No obstacles, the restrictions were useless!

Sitting cross-legged, Elder Void Depletion looked at this scene thoughtfully. After Qin Sang rushed into the group of monkeys, he suddenly closed his eyes, seeming to sense something.

"Hoo hoo hoo..."

In Qin Sang's vision, there was only an endless sea of fire. The ugly monkey screamed fiercely as they pounced on him.

The fire was also dark red, giving off a terrifying heat. If it weren't for the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody protecting his body, Qin Sang doubted he would be able to withstand even this fire's heat for long, let alone fight with the flying monkeys.

"Shua shua..."

Countless illusions came flying. Qin Sang had fought with the fiery flying monkeys before, and he was already very familiar with them. Without waiting for the stick images to come down, he took the first move.

With a thought, strange sound waves spread out like ripples from Qin Sang's body. After leaving his body, they quickly gathered in one place.
