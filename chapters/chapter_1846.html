<h1>Chapter 1837: The Awesome Power of a Transcendent Being</h1><p>A colossal bear's silhouette loomed in the clouds, its upper body alone visible, dominating half the sky. Mountains and rivers lay prostrate beneath it, dwarfed to insignificance.  The bear stood as tall as the heavens, like a deity surveying all creation, advancing with the power to shift mountains and rivers, accompanied by wind, thunder, lightning, and a surging tide of spiritual energy.  The earth trembled, the heavens shook.</p><p>A Dharma Manifestation!</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his face turning pale. He recalled the legends surrounding King Lingyue—this demon was a bear spirit that had achieved enlightenment. His greatest fear had come to pass; King Lingyue hadn't been lured away by the Grand Master, but had come personally to capture him!</p><p>Ahead, auspicious clouds billowed from the sacrificial altar, seemingly within reach, yet Qin Sang felt an immeasurable distance separating him.</p><p>*Rumble… rumble!*</p><p>The earth trembled.  It was unclear whether it was the impact of the bear's Dharma Manifestation, or if the mere spectacle was causing such a commotion.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dark clouds covered the sky, the bear's Dharma Manifestation drawing ever closer. Despite its great distance, the speed of the manifestation rendered that distance meaningless.</p><p>Terror gripped Qin Sang—a primal instinct, not a matter of temperament. This wasn't his first encounter with the Dharma Manifestation of a Transcendent cultivator.  Years ago, when he had left the sacrificial altar with Daoist masters, they had encountered a similar manifestation.  However, others had shared the burden then, and the manifestation had targeted the Daoist officials; he’d only been collateral damage. Even so, the trembling sensation remained vividly in his memory.</p><p>Qin Sang had believed that, now capable of slaying a late-stage Nascent Divinity demon lord, wielding the Qingluan Dharma Manifestation, his performance against a demon king would be less pathetic.  Confronted with the true crisis, however, he realized he had underestimated Transcendent cultivators.</p><p>Only one thought filled Qin Sang's mind:</p><p>Escape!</p><p>*Rumble… rumble…*  Thunder roared.</p><p>Qin Sang held nothing back; the Dharma Manifestation integrated into his body furiously channeled the Qingluan's innate lightning power.  Blinding lightning erupted from his phoenix wings, engulfing him until he was almost a sphere of electricity.</p><p>The demons saw the lightning sphere, and noticed that the side facing the altar bulged slightly.  Then, electric light jutted out, carving a lightning bolt through the void, desperately reaching toward the auspicious clouds. The sphere itself couldn't keep up, resembling a falling drop of water.</p><p>The surrounding demons suddenly awoke, realizing this wasn't an illusion; the changes in the lightning sphere were exactly as they had seen.</p><p>Time seemed to stretch infinitely, every movement of the lightning sphere crystal clear.</p><p>The lightning, normally incredibly fast, seemed to meet immense resistance, slowing dramatically!</p><p>This was all due to the distant bear's Dharma Manifestation.  The distance was too great; the manifestation couldn't arrive in time to stop Qin Sang, and could only watch helplessly as he fled into the sacrificial altar.</p><p>But at that moment, the giant eyes of the Dharma Manifestation locked onto the lightning sphere, unleashing dazzling radiance, like the sun and moon hanging in the heavens. The intense light pierced the void.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit felt a crushing blow, then he discovered something even more terrifying.</p><p>He had the sensation that the heavens were collapsing!</p><p>The spiritual energy around him underwent a transformation, solidifying like iron, imbued with terrifying celestial pressure. The heavens, which should have been his realm to traverse, had become a cage!</p><p>Transcendent cultivators could directly manipulate spiritual energy.  It was said they could, through divine arts, integrate with the spiritual energy to a degree, drastically increasing their power, making them incomparable to those of lower realms.</p><p>For example, the art Qin Sang learned at the Xuan Tian Palace, the *Xuan Tian Yi Qi Da Qin Na Shou* . Nascent Divinity cultivators used their true essence to condense a Xuan Tian hand, at most using celestial perception to draw in some spiritual energy, incorporating celestial power.  But Transcendent cultivators could directly control spiritual energy, forming a giant hand capable of seizing stars and capturing the moon.  No matter how profound one's true essence, how could it compare to the vastness of the heavens and earth?</p><p>Now, Qin Sang truly understood the terror of a Transcendent cultivator.  The opponent was far away, his divine abilities out of reach, yet he could still manipulate spiritual energy, using celestial pressure to restrain him, effortlessly breaking his escape technique!</p><p>The surrounding demons quickly grasped the situation, filled with deep awe for King Lingyue, and looked towards Qin Sang with cruel smiles.</p><p>In a short time, the demons' emotions had fluctuated wildly.  First, they were shocked by Qin Sang's strength, watching helplessly as he escaped.</p><p>Now, they were invigorated again.</p><p>But then, the demons' expressions froze.</p><p>*Li!*</p><p>A clear phoenix cry, originating from within Qin Sang, echoed through the heavens.  A green light flickered on Qin Sang, and a Qingluan soared from the top of his head, its wings spread wide.</p><p>A spectral Qingluan, its form indistinct compared to the immense bear-like Dharma form, yet sharing a similar aura, soared high, its feathers scattering azure light like a starry trail, breathtakingly beautiful.  The moment it appeared, the bear Dharma form’s gaze froze.</p><p>The Dharma form resisted the immense celestial pressure, allowing the flow of vital energy to resume, shattering the cage around Qin Sang.  The pressure on Qin Sang instantly lessened.  With a long roar, he transformed into a streak of lightning, dashing through the auspicious clouds and vanishing into the mists before the astonished gaze of the demons.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Rumble… Rumble…’</p><p>A furious gale roared, accompanied by lightning and thunder. The bear Dharma form, mirroring the celestial upheaval, halted outside the altar, its eyes gleaming.  Its shadow engulfed the demons, startling them awake.</p><p>“We failed, Your Highness. We beg your forgiveness!”</p><p>The demons, including the female demon, prostrated themselves, fear etched on their faces.  The culprit had escaped into the altar before their very eyes, evading even the Lingyue King's personal intervention.  They feared his wrath would fall upon them.</p><p>The female demon’s face paled. She had barely escaped the Sunbird's attack after a desperate struggle.</p><p>Ignoring the demons, the bear Dharma form stared intently at the auspicious clouds, as if trying to pierce through them.</p><p>The female demon gritted her teeth. Her only recourse was to atone for her failure.  “My Lord, I will lead a squad into the altar and swear to bring back his corpse!”</p><p>The bear Dharma form glanced at her, then lowered its gaze slightly. “Very well. His aura is off; he is not our target. Besides…”</p><p>The dark clouds retreated.  The Lingyue King, never appearing in person, left a single, faint statement:  "You are no match for him."</p><p>With Qin Sang vanished and the Dharma form gone, calm returned outside the altar. Fu Hou and the other demons soon arrived, having received news of the event. They stared at the auspicious clouds, their expressions varied.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the altar, Qin Sang, making no pause, sped through the outer golden hall, traversing the winding Celestial River, and finally reached the altar's depths.  He collapsed in his cave, his heart still pounding.</p><p>Reflecting on the ordeal, Qin Sang felt a lingering fear. He had anticipated encountering unforeseen dangers while traveling between the two locations, confident in his abilities to overcome most crises.  Yet, he had encountered a Demon King on his very first trip. His escape had been pure luck.</p><p>Qin Sang still remained unaware of the events' true nature, having been pursued without explanation.  His relief was overshadowed by a profound sense of helplessness.</p><p>“The Nether Origin is becoming increasingly dangerous…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, resolving to avoid unnecessary travel.  As the conflict between the Dao Court and the Guifang Kingdom escalated, such incidents would undoubtedly become more frequent.  Next time, he might not be so fortunate.</p><p>This intensified his desire to find refuge. He summoned his Dharma form and looked up at the Qingluan whose wings slowly beat, murmuring, “I owe you my life this time.”</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma form was his greatest asset, capable of deflecting the might of a Transcendent cultivator, buying him a chance for survival, though it was clearly not strong enough to face a Demon King.</p><p>“If I break through to the mid-stage of the fifth level of the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, my Dharma form will certainly undergo further transformation.  I wonder if it will then be able to protect me from a Demon King…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, realizing he must prioritize the *Celestial Demon Transformation* cultivation. This had been his focus for the past eight years.</p><p>After his breakthrough to the mid-stage of the Nascent Soul Realm, Qin Sang sensed that the insights gained from his battle with Xia Hou might not be enough to propel him to the late-stage. After all, Xia Hou hadn’t been at his peak, and Qin Sang’s strength couldn’t be measured solely by his cultivation level.</p><p>To reach the late-stage, he needed a stronger opponent, a truly exhilarating battle! In the Guifang Kingdom, such opponents were rare—the top demon marquis under the Demon Kings, or those prodigies who had preemptively mastered the Dharma form. These were individuals of high status, seldom seen, and rarely alone even when venturing out. Confronting them risked attracting the Demon Kings.</p><p>Compared to the *Meta-Spirit Sword Cultivation*, the *Celestial Demon Transformation* was easier to advance, making his choice clear.</p><p>“Cultivate to the peak of the mid-stage fifth level and attempt a breakthrough.  Everything else can wait…”</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision. The poisonous fruit’s potency was far greater than the flower dew. In the past eight years, though a short time, his progress had been remarkable.</p><p>He had planned to dedicate time to exploring the altar, seeking the path to ascension.  Now, however, he would prioritize his breakthrough. This chase had instilled a sense of urgency, a feeling of impending upheaval.</p><p>His gaze lingered on the cave entrance, then he closed his eyes, retrieved the fruit pulp, and swallowed a drop.</p><p>Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.  During that decade, Qin Sang only returned home once, when her supply of Yinghua Dan was exhausted; the rest of the time she spent in secluded cultivation. That trip went smoothly. The situation at the source of the trouble was unchanged; that upheaval seemed to have passed. Qin Sang discreetly investigated in Jushan, but only found ambiguous and unreliable information.</p><p>Now, inside her cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, not cultivating, but performing an ancient tribal secret technique.  Her Sky-Eyed Butterfly flew out from her dantian, its wings unfurling as it hovered before her.  Human and insect faced each other, motionless for a long time, the cave falling into an eerie silence.</p><p>If anyone else were present, they would have seen a slender thread of blood extending from Qin Sang's brow.  The thread was so fine it was barely visible, connecting to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly at the other end, spreading into a network covering the butterfly's entire body, including its wings.</p><p>The dispersed blood thread appeared even more delicate, lightly covering the butterfly's body. As time passed, it seemed to slowly merge into the butterfly's being. Gradually, a faint bloody light appeared on the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, and each pattern on its wings was embedded with the blood thread, merging silently.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly gently vibrated its wings, seeming to be in pain. Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as she sensed the butterfly's thoughts. She gently soothed it and produced an Yinghua Dan, feeding it to the insect.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly quickly calmed down and absorbed the medicinal power.  Several hours later, Qin Sang suddenly opened her eyes, her expression serious. She continuously cast various hand seals, not towards the butterfly, but into the blood thread at her brow.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The blood thread broke. Then, a strong bloody glow erupted from Qin Sang's forehead, containing a strange magical seal. The seal flashed and vanished into the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly stiffened for a moment, the Sky-Eye pattern on its wings radiating bright light. As the divine light flowed, its energy began to fluctuate violently!</p><p>Joy flickered in Qin Sang's eyes as she intently watched the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, fully utilizing the tribal secret technique. The butterfly's energy gradually stabilized, then seemed to break through some limit, instantly surging!</p><p>Mid-Fifth Transformation!</p><p>With a continuous supply of Yinghua Dan and Qin Sang continually nourishing it with her blood through the secret technique, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly finally advanced, though still far slower than Qin Sang. This shows just how astonishing Qin Sang's current cultivation speed is.</p><p>Looking at the flitting Sky-Eyed Butterfly and sensing its joyful and excited thoughts, Qin Sang smiled silently, raising a finger to allow the butterfly to land on her fingertip, feeling the changes in it.  Spiritual insects only gain new abilities after undergoing transformation or mutation. After its advancement, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's old abilities, including the Separating and Combining Divine Light, had grown stronger, able to help her more.</p><p>After stabilizing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's cultivation, Qin Sang summoned her spirit jar. A thin thread emerged from the jar, coiling into a circle in her palm: the Fire Jade Centipede.  Supported by pills, it had also reached the peak of the late Fourth Transformation, one step away from transformation. Qin Sang waited several more years until the Fire Jade Centipede’s cultivation was stable before attempting to help it break through.</p><p>Finding the Qingshuang Dan in her Qianjun Ring, Qin Sang took one from the jade bottle. The pill's aura diffused, and the Fire Jade Centipede immediately became agitated, lunging towards the hand holding the pill, conveying an incredibly urgent thought. The temptation of the Qingshuang Dan was irresistible.</p><p>"Feeding this pill to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly back then would have also had significant benefits.  All three Qingshuang Dan are for you. Don't disappoint me…" Qin Sang murmured, flicking her finger.</p><p>The Qingshuang Dan flew towards the Fire Jade Centipede, immediately grasped by it.  As firelight flickered, it refined the pill into its body. The Qingshuang Dan, which could help spiritual insects break through, had extremely potent effects. The Fire Jade Centipede curled up tightly.</p><p>Qin Sang also used her techniques to help it refine the pill, but unfortunately, the Fire Jade Centipede wasn't her innate spiritual insect, so many profound secret techniques from the *Panhu Zhenjing* couldn't be used.</p><p>After a long while, the medicinal power began to dissipate, and the Fire Jade Centipede's twisted body relaxed.  Its energy fluctuated during this time, but it didn’t truly break through, gradually calming.</p><p>"It failed." Qin Sang shook her head slightly.</p><p>This was within her expectations, and she wasn't overly disappointed. She gently tapped the Fire Jade Centipede's carapace, helping it suppress the chaotic medicinal power within.  Even with a failed breakthrough, the remaining medicinal power would still be beneficial, laying the foundation for the next attempt. Thus, the three Qingshuang Dan didn't need to be taken consecutively; she could take the second one after some time, proceeding gradually.</p><p>After the Fire Jade Centipede fell asleep, Qin Sang put it back into the spirit jar and resumed her own cultivation.</p><p>Seven more years passed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in her cave dwelling, enduring the monotony and solitude.  On this day, the cave was as quiet as always. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, seemingly asleep, occasionally fluttering its wings.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's entire body shone with green light, her phoenix wings explosively manifesting, instantly unfolding. The Green Luan Dharma Image appeared in the green light.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, startled awake by the change, immediately took flight, flying to the cave entrance to stand guard.</p>
