<h1>Chapter 1805: Retreat</h1><p>The jade tiles reflected the figures of the two as they walked.  The tower shimmered with shifting lights, creating a sensation of constantly warping space, making one instinctively nervous.  However, according to Venerable Zhenru, the first level was actually harmless.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang put away his Buddhist mudra, and was not expelled by the Vajra Stupa.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru walked, describing the layers of seals within the Vajra Stupa to Qin Sang, and gave Qin Sang some items—treasures that would aid in breaking the seals.</p><p>After careful deliberation, they decided that Venerable Zhenru would lead the way, with Qin Sang following behind. This would allow Qin Sang to familiarize himself with the Vajra Stupa and utilize the advantages of his dual cultivation of body and techniques.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang summoned the Grey Ying Sword. The sword hovered in the air, its light cascading down, encircling the two.</p><p>Before long, they reached the end and saw a Buddha statue.</p><p>Unlike the majestic Buddha statues in temples, this statue was only of normal human height, with lifelike features, as if sculpted after a real monk.</p><p>The monk wore simple robes, his feet resting on a lotus pedestal.  He had gentle eyes, one hand in a respectful gesture, the other grasping a crescent moon staff topped with nine golden prayer beads.</p><p>Compared to the imposing crescent moon staff, the monk's body seemed rather frail, the man and weapon seeming mismatched.</p><p>Upon approaching the statue, Qin Sang's gaze was immediately drawn to the monk's eyes.</p><p>It was hard to believe these were carved eyes. At first glance, they gave an incredibly benevolent impression, but upon meeting the statue's gaze, one would discover that the eyes seemed to contain boundless Buddhist principles, drawing one deeply in.</p><p>"Be careful, Master Qin."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru chanted a Buddhist invocation.</p><p>During his first entry into the Vajra Stupa, he had also been captivated by the statue's eyes. Fortunately, he had been forewarned by ancestral records and was able to break free in time.</p><p>Becoming deeply entrapped and unable to extricate oneself wouldn't necessarily lead to being lost, but it could agitate the mind, requiring a long time to calm down.  They couldn’t afford to fail before even beginning their task.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly withdrew his gaze, his expression unchanged.  He imitated Venerable Zhenru, paying respects to the statue before sitting cross-legged on a lotus pedestal in front of it.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt a shift in light and shadow. The statue before him abruptly vanished, replaced by two stunning women, clad in sheer garments, incredibly alluring, gracefully approaching them.</p><p>Every smile and frown of the women was filled with charm, their gazes tender, their postures enchanting, revealing subtle beauty with every movement, accompanied by boundless enchanting music that stirred desire, like the legendary dance of celestial demons.</p><p>Anyone with slightly weaker willpower would likely be overcome by lust upon seeing this sight, unable to control themselves.</p><p>"Master Qin, please stay behind me. If you feel discomfort, take that spirit pill..."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru's voice came, gesturing to the jade bottle he had given Qin Sang earlier.</p><p>Having grown up surrounded by Buddhist practices, he saw these women as mere fleeting illusions.</p><p>However, the power of the celestial demon dance would only grow stronger.</p><p>Moreover, this celestial demon dance was unlike ordinary illusions; it stirred the deepest desires within one's heart. If Master Dongxuan's willpower was insufficient or he faltered slightly, he might lose control of his mind.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru didn't know what the consequences of getting lost here would be; the Jingtai Temple's ancestors had always been extremely cautious when exploring the Vajra Stupa.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Venerable Zhenru, Qin Sang was protected by the jade Buddha, and this level of celestial demon dance couldn't shake his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang remained clear-headed, but showed no outward reaction.  He responded with a simple affirmation, stood up and followed behind Venerable Zhenru, closing his eyes, mimicking his steps.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru clasped his hands together, chanting Buddhist scriptures, and slowly walked forward.</p><p>The two walked through the celestial demon dance.</p><p>The seductive music entered their ears, igniting their desires, even closing their senses couldn't completely block it.</p><p>More and more women emerged from the shadows, the scene growing richer, and increasingly explicit.</p><p>Some even clung to them, letting out soft gasps, their breath like orchids, their touch seemingly real and smooth.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru and Qin Sang avoided looking directly, passing through the multiple illusions, finally stopping before an archway.</p><p>The archway's gate was transparent, like a gate of light—this was the Stupa's seal.  The moment they stood before it, the power of the celestial demon dance increased several times over.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru's eyes narrowed slightly, and he struck the archway with a forceful palm strike.  With a ‘crack,’ the gate shattered.</p><p>The two quickly stepped through the gate, and the celestial demon dance instantly vanished.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru looked at Qin Sang, noting his calm expression, nodded, and said, "The next level is the Blood Pond Hell."</p><p>Qin Sang could already see the waves of blood surging from ahead.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A torrential deluge of blood engulfed them.</p><p>The Blood Pond Hell, one of the eighteen levels of hell in Buddhist scriptures, is a fitting name given by Jingtai Temple to this place.  The water in the Blood Pond is foul-smelling.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his true energy, forming a protective shield to block the blood, seeing blood everywhere.  Then, Qin Sang discovered that while the blood was blocked, the foul air could penetrate the shield and seep into his body.  The accumulating foulness would cause decay of flesh and bone, and pollute true energy – a terrifying prospect.  Even after activating the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal, Qin Sang could only weaken the penetration, not completely block it.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The surrounding blood surged.  The blood coalesced into grotesquely shaped demons, their faces contorted, staring at them, fiercely attacking.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru, at some point, produced a staff; with a series of sharp strikes, the demons burst into a bloody mist.  Qin Sang also attacked, making a startling discovery: each demon slain left him tainted with the foulness.</p><p>“Ahead lie the Ice Hell and the Volcano Hell, each with similar demons. When I entered the tower alone, by the time I reached the end of the Volcano Hell, my body was already filled with foulness, ice, and fire energies, clashing within me. Even reaching the sixth level, I lacked the strength to proceed…”</p><p>Venerable Zhenru and Qin Sang fought the demons side-by-side, the Venerable detailing his past experiences.</p><p>From the outside, the Vajra Stupa has seven levels.  Inside, there are no distinct levels. Venerable Zhenru believes the space where the Buddha statue is located is the first level, the Celestial Demon Dance is the second, the three hells are the third, fourth, and fifth levels, and the sixth level seal is the last.  Breaking this seal would reveal the treasures of the seventh level!</p><p>But the final seal had stopped all Jingtai Temple's high monks.  Each preceding seal left residual energies; with no chance for rest, reaching the sixth level meant significantly reduced strength.  Even with various elixirs and treasures, breaking the final seal proved impossible.</p><p>This time, with Qin Sang’s assistance, they could share the burden. Qin Sang tried several magic weapons and techniques, but none could prevent the foulness from entering.  He used only the Gray Warbler Sword, its energy like a forest, carving a path through the Blood Pond Hell.</p><p>They sped forward, piercing the Blood Pond, reaching the end and encountering an identical archway.</p><p>Smashing through the archway, a frigid wind assaulted them, instantly coating them in frost.  Braving the wind, the biting cold relentlessly invaded their bodies. Even with their cultivation, they felt on the verge of freezing solid.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something: the tower's seals were indeed strong, but after three trials, they’d faced no mortal danger.  It seemed less a barrier to outsiders and more a test or trial. Jingtai Temple’s high monks believed the seventh level held Buddhist treasures, a conclusion based on this observation.</p><p>Passing through the Ice Hell, they entered the Volcano Hell, a fiery inferno.  Surrounded by blazing red, an invisible fire seemed to burn through their defenses.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru took out a warm jade, placing it in his mouth.  This was a treasure found after years of searching by Jingtai Temple; it alleviated the pressure, and proved effective in the Volcano Hell.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  Confident in his mastery of fire, he did nothing, sensing the invisible fire and silently activating his Fire Lotus technique.  He unexpectedly found the invisible fire unyielding.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang realized the Volcano Hell’s fire, while seemingly real, wasn’t true spiritual fire, but a special array simulating it.  Even he and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly couldn’t distinguish the fake from the real; Qin Sang marvelled at the skill.</p><p>Countless flames formed demons, rushing towards them.  They fought their way through, reaching the seal.</p><p>Sword and staff combined shattered the seal, opening the way to the sixth level!</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the chaotic energies within him – foulness, ice, and fire, requiring constant suppression, impossible to eliminate quickly.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru also checked his own state; it was indeed much better than before.  He rejoiced, saying, "This is the Eighteen Bronze Men Array! Our temple's founder at most broke three."</p><p>The sixth level held no illusions; instead, eighteen bronze monks awaited them. The bronze monks moved like living beings, bowing to them.</p><p>Then, the eighteen bronze monks blurred, instantly forming an array, raising their bronze staves to attack.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>A fierce wind assaulted them.  In an instant, shadowy figures surrounded them; they were enveloped by the eighteen bronze monks.</p><p>Eighteen bronze monks surrounded them, moving swiftly.  The next moment, eighteen bronze rods appeared above the two, descending with terrifying force.</p><p>"Amitabha Buddha," Zhenru Venerable murmured, raising his right palm above his head.  It swelled, transforming into jade.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A gigantic palm met the bronze rods head-on. He wasn’t alone; Qin Sang also attacked simultaneously, his  seal meeting the rods almost at the same time as the giant palm.</p><p>Hard and soft, two completely different forces, yet their cooperation was extraordinarily seamless.  Not only did they repel the rods, but under their deliberate control, the formation of the eighteen bronze monks was disrupted.</p><p>Next, Zhenru Venerable, using some unknown incantation, glowed with Buddhist light that erupted from his crown, instantly transforming into a colossal pillar.  The pillar tilted, the force terrifying; some bronze monks could only raise their rods to defend.</p><p>At this moment, a cold light flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes. With a sudden sword cry, the Grey Sparrow Sword appeared above a bronze monk, along with Qin Sang’s seven sword spirit phantoms.</p><p>The Seven Spirits Killing Formation!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Sword light like lightning. The bronze monk had nowhere to escape. In a moment of crisis, it emitted Buddhist light, and other monks materialized around it.  Unfortunately, the sword light was too fast; before the formation could recover, the sword struck.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>The sound of a bronze bell echoed through the space. The bronze monk shattered, pieces of bronze scattering on the ground, the other monks momentarily stunned.</p><p>Zhenru Venerable showed surprise, amazed by the power of the Seven Spirits Killing Formation, and delighted at having killed a monk so quickly—something unprecedented.</p><p>"Excellent swordsmanship!" Zhenru Venerable exclaimed, golden armor appearing on him.  Like a thunderbolt, he charged toward the remaining monks.</p><p>They had gained the advantage, killing one monk and disrupting the formation, but the bronze monk array wasn't significantly weakened. It seemed the death of their companion had enraged them, enhancing their individual strength. However, without a strict formation, restricting Qin Sang became futile.</p><p>Zhenru Venerable fully engaged the bronze monk formation, while Qin Sang patiently waited for opportunities, killing a monk with each strike.  As time passed, the number of bronze monks dwindled.</p><p>Ten, nine, eight...</p><p>The enraged bronze monks, stronger individually, could not prevent their annihilation.</p><p>Just as the two rejoiced, anticipating the Buddha treasure within the tower, a sudden change occurred.  The remaining six bronze monks roared, throwing their bronze rods into the sky.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The rods clashed, emitting a blinding golden light. The six monks leaped, merging with the golden light.  As they neared the light, they seemed to melt under intense heat, their bodies contorting into grotesque shapes.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Golden sunlight shone, the light intense. Qin Sang and Zhenru Venerable both changed color; they sensed the terror of the light, its ability to melt everything.</p><p>The golden light filled the space; Qin Sang’s light golden skin turned gold, the sensation of his flesh dissolving overwhelming.  The light was everywhere; even the fragments of the true treasure offered no protection. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly secretly used its power, offering only temporary relief.</p><p>Even more terrifying, the dead bronze monks also melted, merging into the golden sun, the light’s power continuing to grow stronger.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't summoned his protective barrier, but the struggling Zhenru Venerable could no longer hold on.  Qin Sang estimated that even then, summoning the barrier would be useless once the golden light reached its peak.</p><p>He felt a mortal threat!</p><p>"Retreat!" Qin Sang shouted. Zhenru Venerable's eyes showed reluctance, but he could only retreat.  The moment they left the archway, they were outside the Vajra Stupa.</p><p>The treasure was so close; neither expected this change. Zhenru Venerable sighed, disheartened.  With their cultivation, they couldn't withstand the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, finally suggesting they rest before trying again.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>They re-entered the Vajra Stupa, only to fall before the golden light again.</p><p>"We cannot pass this level in the short term," Qin Sang declared.</p><p>Zhenru Venerable said solemnly, "Forgive my boldness, but could you perhaps trade the *Seven Master Buddha Seal* to our temple?  I will do my best to meet your demands."</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Zhenru Venerable wanted to use the seal to summon a more powerful cultivator.  The *Seven Master Buddha Seal* itself was one thing, but Qin Sang suspected it might be a part of the disassembled Great Vajra Wheel Seal, something he couldn't easily relinquish.</p><p>In fact, he hadn't used his full strength. Though the Vermilion Bird spirit hadn't awakened, he could barely activate the nine divine birds on the Solar God Tree.  But their goal was to find treasure, not kill; the sixth level wasn't large, and if the nine birds clashed with the golden sun, they would have nowhere to hide.  And one must always be wary; he couldn't use his full power here.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "With respect, Venerable, this Buddha Seal is not yet complete, and I sense it has a special resistance to the golden light. Would you be willing to wait a while longer?"</p><p>If his feeling was correct, the fusion of the seven seals might offer a chance to resist the golden light and break the final seal.</p>
