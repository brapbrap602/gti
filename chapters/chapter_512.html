<h1>Chapter 505: My Own Path</h1><p>A grand manor stood by the river.</p><p>Exquisitely luxurious, it covered over a thousand acres.</p><p>It belonged to the Gongsun family.</p><p>However, few knew that the Gongsun family was divided into inner and outer branches.</p><p>The outer branch consisted of ordinary people, while the inner branch was the true Gongsun clan—a cultivator family affiliated with Mount Shaohua, tasked with guarding the region.</p><p>The Gongsun family was relatively weak.  The current head, Gongsun Li, was 253 years old this year, with only mid-Foundation Establishment cultivation.</p><p>Today, the Gongsun manor was draped in white.</p><p>Gongsun Li, dressed in funerary robes, sat in his armchair, awaiting his end.</p><p>Before him knelt a young man in white.</p><p>Only the two of them were in the room.</p><p>Gongsun Li's expression was unreadable. He gazed blankly at the clear blue sky outside, muttering:</p><p>“I had the potential to reach the Golden Core stage, but in my youth, I indulged in worldly pleasures, wasting my prime.  I barely reached Foundation Establishment at the age of 58.</p><p>“My lifespan extended for another hundred years, yet I continued my hedonistic ways, surrounded by beautiful concubines and fine wine.  By the age of 150, my cultivation had hardly progressed.</p><p>“Only then did I realize my fleeting time, jolted into a cold sweat.</p><p>“I wanted to reform, but it was too late. I strained myself to reach the mid-Foundation Establishment stage at 200, only to be weakened by age, my cultivation stagnating.</p><p>“Now, as death approaches, I see my past as an illusion.</p><p>“Thinking back, I deeply regret it! I deeply regret it!”</p><p>The young man listened to Gongsun Li, his face blank.  Seeing Gongsun Li beckon him, he quickly approached.</p><p>“Dong’er!”</p><p>Gongsun Li grasped the youth's hand tightly, suddenly gasping for breath. He widened his eyes, struggling to finish his last words: “Your talent surpasses mine. After entering Mount Shaohua, you must diligently cultivate. Do not let external factors disturb you and extinguish your Dao heart, leading you down the same path as me!”</p><p>With that, Gongsun Li’s head lolled to the side, and he passed away.</p><p>In a corner of the room, a shadowy figure flickered and vanished, unseen by anyone in the manor.</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving the Gongsun estate, Qin Sang soared into the sky. After checking his direction, he flew towards the island.</p><p>A whole month had passed since he left Mount Xianglong.</p><p>Over the past month,</p><p>Qin Sang had not spent his time in rigorous cultivation as usual. He neither transformed into a mortal nor hid in the shadows.  Instead, he traveled around the countries near Mount Shaohua, observing the world.</p><p>He saw many people.</p><p>Among them were beggars, ordinary people, nobles, those seeking immortality, and independent cultivators. He even saw cultivator families like the Gongsun family…</p><p>Qin Sang did follow Qi Yuanshou’s advice and entered the mortal realm.</p><p>But what he saw was carefully selected—scenes of death and parting.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou would probably be furious enough to vomit blood if he knew.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dao heart was firm. He had already decided on his path and would not be swayed by external factors.  He simply observed, watching the mortals' unwillingness to die due to their attachments, and the cultivators' regrets as death neared.</p><p>Returning to the island,</p><p>Yun Youzi was already waiting.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression softened as he descended from the clouds.</p><p>“I apologize for keeping you waiting, senior.”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head, giving Qin Sang a look. “My junior brother has spent a month among mortals, observing the world. What are your thoughts?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “The paths of others are not my path. I am merely an observer. I will walk my own path.”</p><p>“Clarity of mind gained from observing the complexities of the human world is a type of achievement.”</p><p>Yun Youzi stroked his beard, smiling, and stopped questioning.  He changed the subject. “My junior brother mentioned needing my help. What is it?”</p><p>Qin Sang said thoughtfully, “I wish to ask for your assistance in stealing the Qingyang Gang-Ying from the Qingyang Demon Sect.”</p><p>These words shocked even Yun Youzi. He said gravely, “I remember you once asked me about the location of the Qiantian Gang-Ying, and I advised you against it.  Didn't you heed my warning?”</p><p>“I remember every word you said, senior, and dare not forget,” Qin Sang remained unmoved. “But I have compelling reasons. The Qiantian Gang-Ying is crucial for my Golden Core breakthrough.  The Qiantian Gang-Ying in the Pure Yang Sect’s master's cave is inaccessible; I can only try to obtain the Qingyang Gang-Ying.”</p><p>“Crucial for your Golden Core breakthrough?”</p><p>Yun Youzi's expression turned serious.</p><p>As a cultivator who dedicated himself to the Dao, he understood the significance of the Golden Core stage.  Even if faced with countless difficulties, he would still persevere.</p><p>“Do you understand what the Qingyang Gang-Ying means to the Qingyang Demon Sect? They will never let you take it.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I understand the Qingyang Demon Sect will never agree, so there’s no other way; I must steal it.”</p><p>The Qingyang Gang-Ying was the foundation of the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Their fundamental cultivation method relied on the Qingyang Gang-Ying to cultivate demonic fire.</p><p>In the past, the founding ancestor of the Qingyang Demon Sect discovered the Qingyang Gang-Ying on Shen Gang Peak, which led to their rise to prominence and the flourishing of the Qingyang Demon Sect, making it a powerful demonic sect in the Xiaohan region.</p><p>However, the quantity of Qingyang Gang-Ying was limited.</p><p>Long ago, celestial energy descended upon Mount Shen Gang, transforming over eons into the Gangying.</p><p>Even if more of this energy fell, it's highly improbable it would land on Mount Shen Gang again, and even if it did, it might not transform into Gangying.</p><p>Since the establishment of the Qingyang Demon Sect, the Gangying has only been depleted, never replenished.</p><p>Once the Gangying is exhausted, without another source, the Qingyang Demon Sect's foundation would be shattered, leaving it in name only.</p><p>Qin Sang, after years of covert investigation in Qingyang Market, discovered the alarmingly low amount of Gangying left on Mount Shen Gang.</p><p>Under such circumstances, the Qingyang Demon Sect would never allow anyone to touch the Gangying, not even for treasures.</p><p>Besides, the Qingyang Demon Sect possesses abundant ancestral treasures.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang stated that obtaining it could only be done through theft.</p><p>Yun Youzi stopped trying to dissuade Qin Sang and instead helped assess the feasibility:  "Steal the Gangying?  Although the Qingyang Demon Sect is in decline, it still has four Golden Core masters. Their Sect Master is a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.  While he's nearing his end and far from Nascent Soul, he possesses ancestral power, making him incredibly formidable... Besides me, who else have you recruited? How many Core Formation cultivators?"</p><p>"None."</p><p>Qin Sang blushed and shook his head.</p><p>"My only ally is you, senior.</p><p>However, the Qingyang Demon Sect's four Golden Core cultivators aren't all within the sect. To my knowledge, one was dispatched to the Turbulent Isles waters to fight the Tianxing Alliance, and won't return until the war ends.</p><p>Another is defending Qingyang City against the spirit tide and won't return until that ends.</p><p>Currently, only the Sect Master and a newly promoted Golden Core cultivator remain. With the Purple Micro Palace about to open, the Sect Master will certainly attend;  once he leaves Qingyang City, only one Golden Core cultivator will be left!</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. After the Purple Micro Palace, I may never find such a good chance again."</p>
