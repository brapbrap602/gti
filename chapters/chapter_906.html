<h1>Chapter 898 Yuanchen Technique</h1><p>Bull Peak!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened as he stared at the three newcomers.  He never expected to meet the key figures directly during his visit to Illumination Island!</p><p>It seemed Bull Peak and the Azure Cloud Sect had some bad blood. The Bull Peak cultivators couldn't even return to Azure Cloud Island.  Was this why the Azure Cloud Sect was so tight-lipped about Bull Peak, and his clone couldn't find any information about them?</p><p>Countless thoughts raced through Qin Sang's mind, but his face remained impassive.</p><p>Beside the large man stood a slender man with a similar cultivation level.</p><p>A young man stood behind them, his head slightly bowed, keeping a low profile.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes swept over the three Bull Peak cultivators, a flicker of suspicion in his gaze. For some reason, the young man gave him a faint sense of familiarity, even though they had clearly never met.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn't stare, suspecting it was just a feeling.</p><p>Core Formation cultivators had keen senses.</p><p>Qin Sang stood inconspicuously at the back of the crowd, determined to find an opportunity to approach the three later, so he wouldn't do anything to arouse their suspicion.</p><p>Elder Lu said coldly, "Thing? What thing? The Azure Cloud Sect owes Bull Peak nothing!"</p><p>The large man's eyes narrowed. "Junior Brother Lu, don't play dumb. That thing was originally discovered by our ancestor. When did it become yours?  Do you really want me to reveal all your secrets in front of everyone?"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Elder Lu's expression changed.</p><p>Cultivators from other sects began to murmur amongst themselves, wondering what the large man was talking about, and what unspeakable secret it pertained to.</p><p>Ignoring Elder Lu's anger, the large man glanced around, his tone shifting to a calm and composed manner. "Junior Brother Lu, we meet as fellow disciples. Shouldn't we go inside and have a drink instead of standing out here in the wilderness?"</p><p>Elder Lu's face flickered with indecision, but finally, he snorted coldly and turned towards the bamboo pavilion.</p><p>The large man chuckled and swaggered through the crowd, following him inside.</p><p>Elder Huayang and the other Azure Cloud Sect cultivators wore grave expressions, their eyes complex. The others displayed a variety of emotions, intensely curious about what was happening.</p><p>Everyone hurried to follow, and Qin Sang was no exception.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after entering Illumination Island, Elder Lu paused briefly in front of the bamboo pavilion, turned, and cupped his hands. "Today's matter is a private affair of our Azure Cloud Sect. It's inconvenient for us to invite you in. Please understand, fellow Daoists."</p><p>With that, Elder Lu activated the pavilion's restrictions, his figure flashing inside, followed closely by Elder Huayang and the others.</p><p>Five Core Formation cultivators had come from the Azure Cloud Sect this time. The other three were less powerful than Elder Huayang.</p><p>They could easily overpower the three men from Bull Peak.</p><p>But the large man merely snorted and unhesitatingly followed them into the bamboo pavilion.</p><p>A flash of cyan light followed, and the restrictions completely enveloped the pavilion, silencing all sounds from within.</p><p>Blocked outside and unable to learn the Azure Cloud Sect's secret, everyone felt disappointed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the same. He wondered if he should recall his clone now that he'd confirmed Bull Peak had broken with the Azure Cloud Sect and were no longer on Azure Cloud Island.</p><p>Staying with the Azure Cloud Sect might not yield any further information and could even be dangerous.</p><p>It would be safer to approach the Bull Peak cultivators himself.</p><p>However, judging by their behavior, they didn't seem easy to befriend.</p><p>"Where is Bull Peak? I've never heard of it.  I didn't know the Azure Cloud Sect had a Bull Peak branch, and they seem to be at odds with Elder Lu. Fellow Daoist Hu, you seemed to know something earlier. Could you enlighten me?"</p><p>Unable to enter the pavilion, but unwilling to leave just yet, the crowd moved to a nearby bamboo platform to wait.</p><p>Unable to contain his curiosity, the Qi surnamed cultivator asked a nearby person.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Hu shook his head slightly. "I only know a little. I once heard my master mention that besides the Five Elements and Yin-Yang branches, the Azure Cloud Sect has another mysterious branch.  But my master didn't know Bull Peak's origins or their cultivation techniques. Do any other fellow Daoists know?"</p><p>Fellow Daoist Hu looked around.</p><p>Some shook their heads.</p><p>Others chimed in, "I don't know much either. The Azure Cloud Sect never publicly acknowledged the Bull Peak branch. It's normal for you not to know, Fellow Daoist Qi, since you're not often on the island…"</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd discussed amongst themselves, piecing together various rumors.</p><p>Even sects closely related to the Azure Cloud Sect, like the Smoke and Mist Pavilion, knew little about Bull Peak, assuming the lineage had died out without a successor.</p><p>Now they learned that Bull Peak still had living descendants and had fallen out with the Azure Cloud Sect, being expelled from Azure Cloud Island.</p><p>"Does anyone remember that time when the Azure Cloud Sect suddenly closed its doors for no apparent reason, activating its protective formation for several months? I had just recently formed my core at that time, and it left a deep impression. The cultivators on the island were terrified, thinking a powerful enemy was attacking."</p><p>One cultivator exclaimed, then connected it with other events, his face growing even more astonished. "Shortly after that incident, another Nascent Soul ancestor went into seclusion and hasn't been seen since. Could it be…"</p><p>"That was over a hundred years ago, wasn't it? It was certainly strange…"</p><p>More people recalled the incident, finding it increasingly suspicious.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to their discussion, his eyes flickering.</p><p>Inside the bamboo pavilion.</p><p>Fellow disciples stood facing each other in silence, the atmosphere tense.</p><p>Elder Lu's expression had returned to its usual calm, showing no trace of anger. After a moment of silence, he broke the quiet. "Senior Brother Gao, why are there only three of you here? Where are Senior Brother Qiyunzi and the other senior brothers?"</p><p>"You still remember Senior Brother Qiyunzi? He always thought highly of you."</p><p>The large man's aggressive demeanor softened slightly. "Don't you know? Senior Brother Qiyunzi was already nearing the end of his lifespan, and he was seriously injured that time. He passed away shortly after leaving Azure Cloud Island. As for the other senior brothers, they're not doing well either. Some have passed away, and others can't leave their caves for too long because of the Star Plague.  I'm the only one left to support Bull Peak."</p><p>"Of course, I remember.  Senior Brother Gao, Senior Brother Hong, you both guided me… And who is this?"</p><p>Elder Lu's gaze shifted to the young man.</p><p>"This is Junior Brother Fang. He's very talented and has already formed his core at a young age."</p><p>The large man introduced him.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Lu," the Fang surnamed young man politely bowed.</p><p>"He also cultivates the Yuanchen Technique?"</p><p>Elder Lu glanced at the young man, frowning.</p><p>"No," the large man shook his head. "We wouldn't let the younger generation repeat our mistakes."</p><p>Elder Lu sighed softly and asked, "Since Martial Uncle ultimately allowed you to leave the Azure Cloud Sect and stop practicing the Lightning Manipulation Art, why do you continue to cultivate that technique instead of switching to a different one?"</p><p>"Do you think the Lightning Manipulation Art is something you can just stop practicing? The Azure Cloud Sect supported our cultivation of the Lightning Manipulation Art, knowing full well they would abandon us eventually.  Weren't you aware of that?"</p><p>The large man sneered.</p>
