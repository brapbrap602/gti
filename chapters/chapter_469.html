<h1>Chapter 462: The Tempest</h1><p>A month had passed.</p><p>The beam of light, now dozens of times larger than when it first appeared, had grown to the width of two people embracing.  A shimmering radiance flowed within, a seemingly endless stream of stellar energy pouring into the mirror-like surface.</p><p>Day and night, without pause.</p><p>The silver mirror upon the water's surface was incredibly conspicuous, like a giant silver hole leading to another world.</p><p>Riding on giant pythons, the group saw cultivators from the Celestial League arrive in their flying ships from the south.</p><p>Both sides stopped near the beam of light.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others hurriedly dismounted the pythons and bowed in thanks. Though the pythons were Serpent Witch's spirit beasts, they were also powerful demons of Gold Core realm and had an unclear relationship with the Demonic Beast Mountain. They couldn't be treated with disrespect.</p><p>Immediately following this, the sounds of wind and thunder roared from the north. Other Gold Core cultivators arrived together, stopping when they entered the vicinity of the beam, no longer advancing further.  After all, they weren't here to fight. Their presence served as a deterrent against any treachery from the Celestial League.</p><p>From the south, a large mass of dark clouds rolled in, also halting at a distance, creating a standoff with the Northern Cold Region cultivators.</p><p>The area of water where the beam was located remained unusually calm.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly observed his surroundings. Aside from the two groups of Gold Core cultivators, there wasn't a single person in sight. The Nascent Soul Grandmasters from both sides remained hidden.</p><p>Their absence didn't mean they weren't there. If Nascent Soul Grandmasters truly wanted to conceal themselves, Serpent Witch would likely have difficulty detecting them.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the wooden carving hidden in his chest, feeling a surge of apprehension.  There was no turning back now. He could only brace himself and move forward.</p><p>Leading the Celestial League was a warrior clad in golden armor.</p><p>This individual was extraordinarily tall, twice Qin Sang’s height, with arms as thick as buckets. The heavy, gleaming golden armor seemed almost too small on his massive frame.</p><p>It was unclear whether this was due to a natural gift or a result of his cultivation technique.</p><p>The Golden Armored Warrior held a similar status within the Celestial League as Serpent Witch, a peak Gold Core late-stage expert whose strength seemed even greater than Serpent Witch's.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard rumors that the Golden Armored Warrior had once single-handedly fought against both Serpent Witch and her spirit beast, holding his own against the two of them. His power was undeniable.</p><p>Though they regarded each other as enemies, there wasn't a palpable sense of tension.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Serpent Witch and the Golden Armored Warrior communicating silently, but he couldn't hear anything. He could only patiently wait for Sky Point Peak to open.</p><p>A full hour passed.</p><p>None of those present showed any signs of impatience.</p><p>Finally, the beam of light began to change.</p><p>The mirror-like surface brightened at a visible rate, becoming increasingly dazzling with no sign of stopping. Eventually, it became impossible to look at directly.</p><p>Under the mirror's influence, the beam of light also became radiant, and the fluctuations of shimmering light grew more intense. Qin Sang vaguely sensed that this shimmering light was a unique form of energy, drawn to the beam for some unknown reason.</p><p>Another possibility was that the shimmering light was being drawn in by the mirror itself.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A sudden, explosive sound erupted as the light at the mirror's surface abruptly expanded.</p><p>A powerful wave swept out from its center.</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>The invisible wave surged outwards in all directions, carrying a terrifying force that made Qin Sang and the others pale with alarm.</p><p>The initially calm water surface was instantly battered by the wave’s impact, creating massive waves dozens of feet high.</p><p>Despite the raging waves, Qin Sang and the others remained firmly in place. Serpent Witch had raised her serpent staff, creating a dark green protective barrier that shielded them from the impact.</p><p>Opposite them, the Golden Armored Warrior unleashed his blood essence, his armor blazing as he formed a wall of light fused with his blood essence and armor, firmly protecting the cultivators behind him.</p><p>Protecting them was an easy task for a Gold Core late-stage expert.</p><p>With their safety assured, Qin Sang focused intently on the mirror.</p><p>After the explosion, the light within the mirror was no longer as blinding. Countless star-like fragments erupted from it, eventually dissipating silently into the void.</p><p>The mirror itself seemed to have shattered from the impact. The star fragments and shimmering light formed a swirling tempest, and the surrounding water was churned into a massive vortex.</p><p>The water within the massive vortex spun rapidly, generating a powerful suction force that even distorted the protective barrier created by Serpent Witch's staff.</p><p>When the vortex reached its maximum rotational speed, a muffled sound rang out, and a dense white light shot skyward.</p><p>The beam of light was completely dispersed.</p><p>At the source of the white light, everyone could now faintly see a deep opening appearing at the heart of the vortex, within the depths of the tempest.</p><p>At that moment, Serpent Witch's low shout echoed in their ears.</p><p>"Enter!"</p><p>Enter now?</p><p>Everyone had assumed they would wait for the tempest to dissipate and the Sky Point Peak entrance to fully materialize before entering.  They hadn't expected to have to force their way through the tempest.</p><p>The fluctuations emanating from the tempest weren't as terrifying as they had been initially, but they were still formidable.</p><p>Worried expressions appeared on their faces, but Serpent Witch had already withdrawn her staff. Feeling the pull of the suction force, they dared not disobey.  Each activated their protective talismans and flew downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang descended at a moderate pace. Just as he neared the tempest, his green robe-like vestment flared with light, and mystical runes appeared on his back.</p><p>This vestment was a high-quality, top-grade magical artifact with strong defensive capabilities.</p><p>The moment he plunged into the tempest, Qin Sang felt powerful tearing forces from all directions. The green light of his robe almost dissipated.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang poured his spiritual energy into it, saving the vestment from destruction.</p><p>His vision was completely consumed by white light, his divine sense unable to leave his body. Within the chaotic tempest, Qin Sang struggled to maintain his balance as he plummeted downwards.</p><p>Finally, he broke free from the tempest and fell into the opening. But before Qin Sang could rejoice, he was immediately subjected to an even stronger suction force.</p><p>This force wasn't singular, but rather countless forces intertwined, forming a new tempest even more chaotic and powerful than the one outside, making it almost impossible to resist.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Vice Island Master Xiao's words. Ignoring everything else, he focused on protecting himself, allowing the tempest to buffet him like a lone boat adrift at sea.</p><p>He could still clearly feel the wooden carving hidden in his chest and breathed a sigh of relief. Granny Jing hadn't lied; it hadn't been discovered.</p><p>After a dizzying spin, Qin Sang keenly sensed the tempest's force weakening.</p><p>Even better, his vision, previously overwhelmed by white light, began to return.</p><p>Aware of the dangers within Sky Point Peak, Qin Sang widened his eyes. As he tumbled through the tempest, he strained to discern his surroundings.</p><p>Fighting against the disorientation, he memorized everything he saw, piecing together a coherent view.</p><p>He was alone.</p><p>Before entering, Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong had held onto a sliver of hope, staying close together. But the moment they entered the opening, they were separated by the tempest.</p>
