<h1>Chapter 1371: Ten Thousand Li Pursuit</h1><p>On the back of the One-Legged Divine Bird, a small fox was perched.</p><p>The blood energy emanating from the One-Legged Divine Bird couldn't taint the little fox.</p><p>The little fox's fur was pure white, delicate and adorable, truly a sight to behold.</p><p>Its aura was nothing like its cute and fragile appearance; it was clearly a nascent soul-stage  great demon!</p><p>However, one of the little fox's hind legs was covered in blood, dangling there, the exposed flesh revealing strands of black energy, writhing and twisting like a bone-attached maggot, difficult to remove.</p><p>Another small beast, shaped like a fox but only the size of a rat, stretched out its two front paws, tightly gripping the feathers of the One-Legged Divine Bird, also staring at the azure light, its round eyes filled with annoyance.</p><p>Another streak of black escaping light fell behind them.</p><p>Its appearance was even more bizarre and grotesque than the One-Legged Divine Bird.</p><p>Its upper body was a fish head and fish body, covered in black scales, but its lower body had two frog legs, causing it to hop forward as it flew, appearing somewhat comical.</p><p>The Frog-Fish wasn't slow, but it was far inferior to the azure light and the One-Legged Divine Bird, quickly falling behind.</p><p>It opened its mouth full of fangs, let out a shrill scream, and leaped into the sea.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Waves crashed in all directions.</p><p>The Frog-Fish was in its element.</p><p>A dark shadow appeared beneath the surface of the sea, its speed increasing explosively as it moved up and down, rapidly giving chase.</p><p>It wasn't until the three streaks of escaping light disappeared into the distance.</p><p>A faint bloody aura drifted from the north.</p><p>The bloody aura grew stronger and stronger, fresh blood flowing with the seawater, indicating an unknown number of deaths there. Gradually, fragments of large ships began to float over.</p><p>The most striking was a lifelike golden dragon head sculpture.</p><p>It should have been a dragon ship, but now it was in pieces!</p><p>The one fleeing in the azure light was none other than Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the earth-shattering demon aura behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back at the relentless enemy, cursing inwardly.</p><p>At this moment, he had already passed through the Storm Belt and arrived at the Northern Sea Three Realms.</p><p>The process was fairly smooth, with a few close calls.</p><p>The aura of the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros had shown no signs of weakening.</p><p>However, the Storm Belt was wider than he had anticipated, and the consumption along the way far exceeded his expectations, becoming somewhat unbearable even with Qin Sang's current cultivation.</p><p>Because he hadn't found a safe place to rest along the way, he could only summon the nascent soul puppet to help him withstand the storms for a while when they weren't too violent, buying him time to recover.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang had prepared adequately, his vital essence was nearly depleted when he broke through the Storm Belt.</p><p>Flying out of the storm, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, thinking to himself how close it was. He had come over right after breaking through to the middle Nascent Soul stage, which was still too risky.</p><p>Arriving in a new land.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of finding a place to recover first, but he carefully searched for a long time, but couldn't find a stable place.</p><p>During the search, Qin Sang encountered a dragon ship.</p><p>The dragon ship was enormous.</p><p>Even in the Canglang Sea, such a large ship was very rare.</p><p>What was even more surprising was that the dragon ship was heavily warded with restrictions, protected by spirit formations, and there were even Core Formation stage cultivators on board.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his true cultivation, disguised himself as a rogue cultivator, and learned after making inquiries that this sea area was very chaotic, with great demons frequently appearing, making it very unsafe, even for Core Formation stage cultivators to travel together.</p><p>The language used by these people was the same as that of the Northern Chen Realm, which Qin Sang had come to expect.</p><p>Knowing that it wasn't advisable to stay here for long, Qin Sang didn't want to linger, so he paid spirit stones, rented a quiet room, and prepared to meditate on the ship, seizing the time to recover.</p><p>Unexpectedly, while Qin Sang was meditating, the dragon ship was suddenly attacked!</p><p>There had been no warning signs.</p><p>The dragon ship's protective spirit formation had no effect at all and was breached, instantly breaking in half!</p><p>The people on board were horrified to discover that three figures had appeared out of thin air in mid-air, not concealing their demonic aura, and were actually all nascent soul-stage demon kings!</p><p>The nascent soul puppet, ordered to protect Qin Sang, immediately counterattacked, and by the time Qin Sang was awakened, he had already been exposed.</p><p>At this point, it was too late to repeat the trick and disguise himself as a demon king. However, even if the nascent soul puppet hadn't attacked, it probably wouldn't have been easy to deceive them.</p><p>His previous successes in deceiving demon kings were due to other factors; the opponents were preconceived and wouldn't suspect him.</p><p>But Qin Sang was a newcomer and knew nothing about the Northern Sea Three Realms and the demons here, so it would be easy to reveal flaws and be recognized by his opponents.</p><p>Moreover, demon kings might not show mercy to unfamiliar, isolated members of their own kind.</p><p>Qin Sang's weakened state couldn't be concealed and wouldn't escape their eyes.</p><p>The three demon kings seemed to know each other very well, with exceptionally smooth coordination.</p><p>*The Lightning Control Art* had just been cast.</p><p>The One-Legged Divine Bird directly manifested its demon body, its scarlet blood energy soaring into the sky. Instead of attacking Qin Sang, it turned and pounced on its companions, opening its mouth and spewing a streak of blood light towards the Heavenly Lightning.</p><p>However, it didn't expect the *Lightning Control Art* to be so powerful; the blood light collided with the Heavenly Lightning and was shattered.</p><p>The aftermath of the *Lightning Control Art* struck the weakest little fox.</p><p>The Frog-Fish, like the One-Legged Divine Bird, chose to save its companion first, puffing out its cheeks and spewing out a ball of green light. This ball of green light was like a viscous liquid, instantly covering the void.</p><p>The nascent soul puppet was caught off guard and was tainted by the green light, its movements immediately becoming sluggish and much slower. If Qin Sang hadn't ordered the nascent soul puppet to retreat and break free from the green light in time, it would have been surrounded by the enemy.</p><p>"Indeed, not everywhere is like the Northern Chen Realm, where humans and demons coexist peacefully. Even in the Northern Chen Realm, there are bound to be rifts and mutual vigilance between different races."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled bitterly, "I wonder how rampant the demons of the Northern Sea Three Realms are, that I would encounter so many demon kings at once! I haven't heard that this place is the domain of demons..."</p><p>He was a little regretful that he was too eager to recover after boarding the ship and hadn't carefully inquired about the situation in the Northern Sea Three Realms from the fellow cultivators.</p><p>However, they were at most Core Formation stage cultivators and probably couldn't explain it clearly either.</p><p>Fortunately, he had bought a sea chart from the ship owner and knew that continuing ahead would lead to land, which was the domain of humans. Even with the three demon kings together, they wouldn't dare to pursue him onto land.</p>
