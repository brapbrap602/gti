<h1></h1><p>As Demonic Fire poured in, the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl transformed into a black Demonic Pearl. A fine Buddhist treasure, now tainted by Demonic Fire, could be considered a demonic artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind sank into the Mani Pearl, sensing the protective罡罩(spiritual shield) still intact, now strengthened and sustained by the power of Demonic Fire. Perhaps calling it a 'Flame Shield' would be more accurate.</p><p>Demonic Fire served as the Flame Shield's power source. It was certain that not only Demonic Fire, but other Spirit Flames could also be absorbed by the Mani Pearl. The stronger the Spirit Flame, the stronger the Flame Shield.</p><p>Discovering the Mani Pearl's properties, Qin Sang was both astonished and delighted. He was astonished by the pearl's exquisite ability to contain all types of fire. With Qin Sang's understanding of refining techniques, such a feat was simply impossible!</p><p>At least, Qin Sang hadn't yet tested the Flame Shield's limits.  He continuously infused Nine Nether Demonic Fire, and the Flame Shield strengthened accordingly, showing no signs of slowing down.</p><p>He was delighted to have obtained this extraordinary treasure, as it would bring immeasurable improvement to his abilities. Skilled in fire manipulation, he had, by chance, obtained two top-tier Spirit Flames: Nine Nether Demonic Fire and Southern Bright Ember Fire. He had never lacked offensive methods, but his defenses were somewhat lacking.</p><p>Previously relying on the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl's protective spiritual shield, after breaking through to late Nascent Soul, he felt the shield was somewhat insufficient.</p><p>As a craftsman, he had considered crafting a protective magical treasure for himself. However, suitable spiritual materials were difficult to find, and his energy was consumed by the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," so the project was shelved.</p><p>Every time he encountered danger, he either relied on the Sky Eye Butterfly's ability to see through illusions and receive early warnings or relied on his superior escape techniques to quickly extricate himself from unfavorable situations and maneuver against his opponents.</p><p>Once in an environment filled with pervasive danger, this weakness would be exposed.</p><p>A wise man does not stand beneath a crumbling wall. Qin Sang's choice was generally to retreat if possible, even if it meant missing opportunities.</p><p>With the Mani Pearl in hand, the situation was entirely different!</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire, an offensive Spirit Flame, when infused into the Mani Pearl, transformed into a sturdy Flame Shield, second to none in defense.</p><p>The drawback was that offense and defense couldn't be used simultaneously. He had to maintain the fusion of Demonic Fire and the Mani Pearl to sustain the Flame Shield.  So far, Demonic Fire was still Qin Sang's most readily available and frequently used offensive method, and he couldn't abandon it.</p><p>Without using his Natal Spirit Sword, the sword formation's power was slightly weaker. The Sun God Bird was powerful enough, but not agile.</p><p>Of course, using the Flame Shield to defend against attacks would significantly deplete Qin Sang's True Essence. Compared to the other drawback, this was negligible.</p><p>He could only adapt to the situation, relying on his control over Demonic Fire to switch between offense and defense at any time. This would severely test Qin Sang's ability to seize opportunities in battle.</p><p>Thinking about this, Qin Sang withdrew the Demonic Fire and suspended the Mani Pearl before him.  He began refining it and, unexpectedly, the process was remarkably smooth.  It was likely due to his previous refinement of the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl, saving him a lot of trouble.</p><p>Just as he was about to explore the Mani Pearl's other functions, his avatar suddenly sent a thought.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Mani Pearl transformed into a beam of Buddhist light, similar to the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl, and could be stored in his dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang rose, flew to the top of the jungle, and looked up at the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Having just emerged from the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction, he had a rough understanding of the Five Elements Divine Restriction's workings.</p><p>Clouds and mist surrounded the mountain, all manifestations of the Five Elements Restriction.  The core of the Five Elements Restriction was the Five Elements Divine Restrictions, arranged according to the cycle of mutual generation. Different Divine Restrictions displayed different phenomena.</p><p>For example, within the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction's area, firelight flickered, and the clouds resembled burning clouds.</p><p>There were clear boundaries on both sides of the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction. To the west, the clouds and mist were dark yellow and thick, indicating the Earth Divine Restriction, located to the left of the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction. From this, he deduced that the Metal Divine Restriction was to the left of the Earth Divine Restriction, its position almost reaching the shadowed side of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had speculated that the Metal Divine Restriction would undergo a change and had instructed his avatar to keep a close watch.  Now, it was confirmed.</p><p>Within the Metal Divine Restriction, points of light flickered like stars, dyeing the clouds and mist into golden morning clouds.</p><p>At this moment, the clouds and mist were turbulent. Though the light hadn't diminished and was even more dazzling, there was a sense of fragmentation, collisions occurring between them, indicating internal conflict within the Divine Restriction.</p><p>This fragmentation wasn't very obvious, further obscured by layers of clouds and mist, but it couldn't escape Qin Sang's Dharma Eye.</p><p>Not just Qin Sang.</p><p>Su Zinan, Mo Xingdao, the Poison King, and Venerable Huaixin, all with their high cultivation, possessed keen eyesight.</p><p>These signs were enough for them to make a judgment.</p><p>After a brief moment of contemplation, Qin Sang made a decision: to enter the Metal Divine Restriction and investigate!</p><p>He had just obtained the Mani Pearl. Returning to the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction, his ability to withstand the Heavenly Fire would be greatly enhanced, but breaking the restriction would still take some effort.</p><p>The Metal Divine Restriction was definitely influenced by something.</p><p>For them, even a slight flaw in the restriction, if grasped, could be turned into an advantage, easily finding a way out.</p><p>There was no reason to miss a shortcut!</p><p>Qin Sang decided to act, but before doing so, he withdrew his avatar.</p><p>The purpose of this trip was the Wordless Jade Tablet behind the Five Elements Divine Restriction. Within the Divine Restriction, breaking the restriction was the priority. He could release his avatar to assist him in combat when needed.</p><p>With the Mani Pearl, his safety was guaranteed.</p><p>The avatar was slightly inferior to others, not to mention the elusive and strange expert lurking in the shadows. The avatar might become a hindrance.</p><p>He withdrew his avatar and hid the Fire Jade Centipede in his sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure sped off, re-entering the Five Elements Restriction.  However, he was unaware that Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao had also withdrawn from the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction, making the same choice as him.</p><p>Fortunately, the restriction's range was vast, and they didn't encounter each other on the periphery of the clouds and mist.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang entered the depths of the clouds and mist, arriving at the edge of the Metal Divine Restriction.</p><p>Unexpectedly, while the clouds and mist appeared so dazzling from outside, upon closer inspection, Qin Sang saw a dim and hazy scene.</p><p>Various restrictions flashed through Qin Sang's mind. Many restrictions could create such a scene, but none seemed quite right.</p><p>Unable to discern anything, he could only try it himself.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Gold Sinking Sword and activated the Flame Shield for protection. He stepped in!</p><p>In an instant, the world spun.</p><p>All surrounding sounds vanished, along with the dim light, becoming almost like night. Within the vast wilderness, only Qin Sang's solitary figure stood, making the place seem even more desolate.</p><p>Silence reigned.</p><p>The Blazing Sun Divine Restriction had rained down Heavenly Fire, while this place was dim and quiet, representing two extremes.</p><p>Qin Sang's feet touched the ground. Looking down, he saw rough rocks beneath his feet, a sloping hillside, and scattered boulders all around. There was no path here, but it didn't prevent him from climbing upwards.</p><p>"Is this the true mountain body of Emperor Bestowal Mountain?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>Through the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang confirmed that these rocks were not illusions, but real.</p><p>He was directly sent into the mountain. Where was the Metal Divine Restriction?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, a feeling arising in his heart. He abruptly looked up.</p><p>Above the sky, stars hung.</p><p>There was no moon here, only flickering starlight.</p><p>Compared to the true heavens, the stars here were sparse, not even forming a complete river of stars. It was as if the sky was incomplete, the starlight not bright enough.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, remaining motionless for a long time.</p><p>He had a feeling that these stars were like eyes, watching him, their auras locking onto him.</p><p>He felt like he had been thrown into a sea of stars, isolated from the world.</p><p>Under his gaze, the starlight gradually brightened, but the ground remained dim and quiet, the stars shining solely on Qin Sang!</p><p>The stars reflected in Qin Sang's pupils.</p><p>His Sky Eye divine ability pierced through the essence of the stars, revealing them to be swords hanging high in the sky!</p><p>"This is... a sword formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang realized.</p><p>A sword formation replaced the Metal Divine Restriction's function here, maintaining the Five Elements cycle. Qin Sang was curious how the formation master achieved this.</p><p>Soon, he discovered the key.</p><p>These sword intent stars were fewer than the complete celestial stars, hence their sparseness.  However, their positions corresponded to actual stars.</p><p>Three Enclosures and Four Symbols, only one Symbol was selected!</p><p>"The Seven Western Lunar Mansions! The White Tiger Constellation!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart trembled. The formation master actually used swords to manifest a constellation, their ambition astounding.</p><p>The White Tiger belonged to Metal, symbolizing slaughter.</p><p>As soon as this thought arose, Qin Sang felt as if his entire body was targeted by sharp sword energy, an aura of killing intent. Even through the Flame Shield, he felt a strange stinging sensation.</p><p>Little did he know, this was one of the Gold Phase Hall's most powerful sword formations—the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation!</p><p>The Seven Lunar Mansions constituted the White Tiger Constellation.</p><p>Swords inherited the power of Heaven and Earth, channeling the constellation's power.  The White Tiger descending upon the world represented the peak of swordsmanship and slaughter in this realm. The Gold Phase lineage, with their sword cultivators, jointly deployed the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, slaying countless demons during the Demonic Tribulation and establishing immortal merit.</p><p>Using the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation here was fitting.</p><p>...</p><p>The Poison King and Venerable Huaixin searched around Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>They had long noticed the anomaly in the Metal direction but, with limited information, hadn't acted rashly.</p><p>Circling the mountain, they indeed found something.</p><p>They found multiple traces of battles. Through clues, they deduced the movements of those involved and their approximate identities.</p><p>"This should be the work of Old Daoist Zi Lei."</p><p>The Poison King pointed to a scorched area in the forest.</p><p>The vitality of the plants here was extinguished, but a unique thunderous aura lingered in the ground.</p><p>The Poison King was familiar with this aura, unique to  Zi Lei Zhenren, the Master of the Eight Sceneries View.</p><p>"The Eight Sceneries View's thunder arts are extremely difficult to cultivate. Very few can even begin to learn them, and even fewer can master them.  Only Old Daoist Zi Lei has reached such a realm in this era. Looking at all past Masters of the Eight Sceneries View, he possesses top-tier talent."</p><p>The Poison King drew in a wisp of the aura, purple energy writhing in his palm. He didn't hold back his praise for Zi Lei Zhenren, also warning Venerable Huaixin not to underestimate him.</p><p>The Daoist and Buddhist sects previously had a decent relationship.  However, the Eight Sceneries View's appearance here, concealed from Sweet Dew Monastery, was intriguing.</p><p>Venerable Huaixin nodded. He had long known of Zi Lei Zhenren's reputation. Seeing this, even if it was just residual battle energy, he couldn't help but sigh, "Reputation doesn't compare to witnessing it firsthand."</p><p>Judging from the battle traces, both sides were composed of two peak experts. The opposing side was practically chased and beaten by Zi Lei Zhenren and He Gao Zhenren. Of course, it was also possible that the opponent was eager to escape and didn't want to engage in a protracted fight.</p><p>"I smell the aura of Yin Demons," Venerable Huaixin said, palms together.</p><p>The Poison King chuckled, "It's undoubtedly Fan Laomo's Myriad Demons Yin Scripture.  It seems that old demon was forced to use even the ninth transformation of the Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus, barely able to withstand Old Daoist Zi Lei's thunder arts. He's not afraid of thunder shattering his Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus.  The other person's aura is rather mixed, but their strength is not weak..."</p><p>Venerable Huaixin followed the traces to the edge of the clouds and mist, stating with certainty, "They chased them here!"</p><p>The Poison King looked into the depths of the clouds and mist, observing the turbulent scene.  "This phenomenon might be caused by them. Master has also seen it; this mountain is sealed by the Five Elements Restriction. Entering from anywhere will be blocked by the Divine Restrictions. Since we haven't found any trace of that old thief, we might as well follow in their footsteps."</p><p>Venerable Huaixin readily agreed, and the two stepped into the clouds and mist, quickly reaching the sword formation.</p><p>...</p><p>In another part of the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao had similar encounters as Qin Sang, resisting the sword formation's attacks, observing the stars, sensing the formation's aura, and searching for a way out.</p><p>...</p><p>At the foot of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The nuns of Veiled Moon Convent, passing by the Gold Phase Hall, faced a difficult decision.</p><p>Veiled Moon Convent inherited the divine abilities of both the Gold Phase and Water Phase lineages. Both halls' ruins held great attraction for them. Additionally, the anomaly on Emperor Bestowal Mountain and the location of the unknown Immortal Palace also held incredible opportunities.</p><p>Four locations, where should they go?</p><p>In the end, the old nun decided to split into two groups, as they noticed the Gold Phase Hall hadn't been explored yet, with no other people around, making it relatively safe.</p><p>The old nun left behind half of their number, those with slightly weaker cultivation, repeatedly instructing them to be satisfied with what they found and not be greedy.</p><p>The Gold Phase Hall was constructed by formation masters from the Earth Phase lineage. While not as complex as the Earth Phase Hall with its thousands of halls and pavilions, its scale was quite vast, encompassing the mountains.  Sword cultivators were independent and disliked having their caves too close to others.</p><p>Various sword formations were integrated within, nested within each other. Each mountain peak was a sword, pulling one would affect the whole. It was the most dangerous of the five halls.</p><p>The other group was led by the old nun herself, consisting of most of their experts, including Liu Li.</p><p>They first circled the foot of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, observing the surging fog halfway up, and the clouds and mist above. They knew it was dangerous and didn't rashly ascend, deciding to observe further. They bypassed Emperor Bestowal Mountain, heading towards the Water Phase Hall.</p><p>Then, they were all stunned.</p><p>The Water Phase Hall was gone, replaced by a frozen wasteland.</p><p>The inheritances of the Water Phase Hall were also annihilated.</p><p>"What a ruthless act!"</p><p>The nuns gritted their teeth, but they could do nothing.</p><p>Let alone not knowing who did it, even if they did, it was probably someone they couldn't afford to provoke.</p><p>Sighing helplessly, the old nun noticed the intact Exquisite Sound Pavilion not far away and led everyone there.  Fortunately, the Exquisite Sound Pavilion hadn't been harmed.</p><p>The old nun had known there was a map of the Formless Immortal Sect on the first level. Entering the jade pavilion, she was surprised to find the map intact.  She quickly ordered the nuns to be on guard and activated the restriction.</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect unfolded before the nuns.</p><p>Liu Li stepped forward, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the old nun, softly asking about the location of the Immortal Palace's teleportation formation.</p><p>From Veiled Moon Convent's records, the old nun identified several locations where the teleportation formation was most likely to be located, but she wasn't certain which one. This map could help her eliminate possibilities.</p><p>The old nun stared at the map, pondering for a long time, recalling various records and the scenes she had witnessed since entering, comparing them to the map.  Finally, she eliminated three locations, but remained uncertain about two.</p><p>"Cliff's Edge, Northern Forbidden Zone..."</p><p>The old nun pointed to the two locations.</p><p>Liu Li memorized them.</p><p>Hearing the old nun and the others discuss their decision to take advantage of the other experts fighting over the Immortal Palace's opportunities to search for treasures in the Gold Phase Hall and on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, Liu Li surprisingly decided to search for the Immortal Palace alone.</p><p>The old nun worried it was too dangerous for Liu Li to face so many powerful cultivators alone. The opportunities within the Formless Immortal Sect were already enough for them. However, Liu Li was resolute.</p><p>She had never forgotten her original purpose for coming to the Central Continent: to find her master. This pursuit permeated her entire cultivation life.  Any other opportunity could be abandoned.</p><p>"I'll be careful," Liu Li said decisively, setting off alone, walking out of the jade pavilion. "Elder Sister, if you find a special sword scripture on Nascent Soul sword cultivation in the Gold Phase Hall, please bring it back."</p>
