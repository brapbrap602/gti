<h1>Chapter 1760: Sword Cultivator</h1><p>The river flowed on, vast and surging.</p><p>A figure traveled along the riverbank, riding the wind.</p><p>“Star Valley should be just up ahead…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the geomantic map, swept his gaze over the surrounding terrain, flew up a high mountain, observed for a while, and made his judgment.</p><p>Leaving the riverbank, Qin Sang traveled north for over a hundred miles, stopping before a dense bamboo forest.</p><p>Looking down from above, the bamboo forest stretched for a thousand miles in every direction. Purple bamboo grew thick and abnormally strong, some as large as ancient trees, a sight rarely seen in the outside world.</p><p>The night wind blew, rustling the bamboo leaves.</p><p>There was no moon tonight.</p><p>Within the darkness-shrouded sea of bamboo, faint orbs of light could be seen flickering from time to time. Qin Sang sensed through his Qi that these were spirits born within the bamboo forest.</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Qin Sang leaped towards the center of the bamboo sea. Reaching a certain point, he plunged downwards.</p><p>*Swish, swish…*</p><p>Passing through layers of branches and leaves, Qin Sang felt a softness beneath his feet—a thick carpet of decaying leaves accumulated over countless years.</p><p>His speed undiminished, he plunged straight through the decaying leaves and suddenly found himself in an open space. Below was an underground valley.</p><p>He could see that withered bamboo stalks crisscrossed, forming a skeletal framework that supported the thick layer of decaying leaves, concealing the valley.</p><p>Within the bamboo sea, such places were commonplace.  The terrain here was originally mountainous, not a plain, but it was covered by the flourishing bamboo sea and the thick layer of decaying leaves.</p><p>Due to its remote location and the exceptionally thick layer of decaying leaves, one would have to deliberately scan the bamboo sea with their divine sense to discover this valley, which was why few knew of its existence.</p><p>Hovering above Star Valley, Qin Sang saw not darkness, but faint, shimmering lights within the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang was very familiar with this sight. These shimmering points of light were Star Essence Stones!</p><p>In the Storm Realm, outside of Fingerheaven Peak, Star Essence Stones were extremely rare. Only in places like Fingerheaven Peak, where Star Essence converged, could Star Essence Stones gradually form within the rich concentration of Star Essence.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately took out the Star Gathering Net, a gift from his senior sister, back when she was still Granny Jing, specifically for collecting Star Essence Stones.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered several formations within the Yuan Mirage Sect that could be powered by Star Essence Stones.</p><p>He didn't rush to collect the stones. He flew from one end of Star Valley to the other, pondered for a moment, then descended deeper into the valley.</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang stopped, a hint of disappointment in his expression.</p><p>The concentration and quantity of Star Essence within Star Valley were inferior to that of Fingerheaven Peak.</p><p>Back then, even though he hadn't reached the summit of Fingerheaven Peak, he could still make a rough estimate. Even if he returned to Fingerheaven Peak, it would be a struggle for him to achieve a breakthrough, and this place was definitely insufficient.</p><p>Figuring he might as well since he was already there, Qin Sang activated the Star Gathering Net to collect the Star Essence Stones. Gradually reaching the depths of Star Valley, he suddenly let out a soft gasp, unexpectedly discovering a cave at the bottom of the valley, seemingly leading deep underground.</p><p>Star Essence also flowed within the cave entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized it for a few moments, then put away the Star Gathering Net and flashed into the cave.</p><p>The entrance was narrow, but the interior gradually widened. The terrain was exceptionally rugged, ascending and descending, twisting and turning left and right, but it was clear that the cave continued downwards into the earth.</p><p>After traveling for a while, Qin Sang discovered that the Star Essence, contrary to his expectations, didn't grow increasingly dense. After reaching a certain threshold, it began to thin out again.</p><p>Not yet having reached the end of the cave, Qin Sang was unwilling to leave just yet. He continued downwards, simultaneously trying various methods to determine the cause of Star Valley's formation.</p><p>*Splash, splash…*</p><p>The faint sound of flowing water came from ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. “Have I reached an underground river?”</p><p>He quickened his pace. After traveling for another ten miles or so, the underground space suddenly opened up, revealing a vast underground river several miles wide. The rocky walls shimmered with grains of light, suggesting a special type of ore.</p><p>Here, the Star Essence was already very thin. Disappointed, Qin Sang was about to investigate briefly before retreating when, out of nowhere, a chill ran down his spine, and a premonition of danger arose!</p><p>“Danger!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Skyeye Butterfly sent a warning.</p><p>The river!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with sharp light.  The instant he sensed the anomaly, he swiftly formed hand seals, and a faint golden light enveloped him, like a golden armor.</p><p>Diamond Celestial Armor Seal!</p><p>Almost the moment the seal was completed, the surface of the dark river exploded.  Amidst the splashing water, a dazzling sword light, like a bolt of lightning, shot towards Qin Sang's face!</p><p>“Sword Cultivator!”</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p>Since arriving in this realm, this was the first time he had encountered a Daoist sword cultivator.</p><p>The three major schools of the Daoist tradition—Dragon Tiger Altar, Golden Seal Altar, and Warhost Altar—each had distinct characteristics. Even those who used swords rarely focused purely on sword cultivation. Their spirit swords were mostly spell swords, used as aids in casting spells.</p><p>This opponent was different.  This sword strike, imbued with pure sword intent, clearly demonstrated a deep mastery of the sword.</p><p>Qin Sang himself was also considered a sword cultivator, and his perception wouldn't be wrong.</p><p>A sword cultivator who had also integrated talismanic Dao, what other methods could they possess?</p><p>Qin Sang had no time to ponder. This sword strike posed a genuine threat, and he dared not underestimate it.</p><p>With a solemn expression, Qin Sang let out a cold snort and instantly formed four seals in succession: Auspicious Seal, Lotus Seal, Rotating Altar Seal, and Demon Subduing Seal!</p><p>Of the six seals he had mastered, only the Diamond Great Wisdom Seal was missing.</p><p>This seal was the fifth of the Seven Buddha Seals. Unlike the other seals, which brought about obvious external changes, the Diamond Great Wisdom Seal had no visible manifestation. Its primary function was to cultivate unwavering focus and wisdom, allowing the user to remain calm and undisturbed amidst battle, unfazed by internal or external distractions.</p><p>For others, this seal might be as important as the Diamond Celestial Armor Seal, but for Qin Sang, its usefulness was limited.</p><p>Five seals unleashed.</p><p>By now, the sword light was less than three feet from his forehead.</p><p>At this critical juncture, Qin Sang's body trembled slightly, his Qi and blood surged like the roar of a dragon and the growl of a tiger, and a golden, strange Buddha seal materialized before him, perfectly intercepting the sword light and pressing down.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The earth trembled, and massive waves surged.</p><p>The golden light shattered, fragments scattering everywhere.</p><p>Within the golden light, the Buddha seal firmly resisted the sword light, preventing it from advancing an inch.  The two powerful forces continued to clash.</p><p>Now, within the sword light, a three-foot-long azure blade could be seen, its slender body shimmering with brilliant spiritual light, exceptionally extraordinary.</p><p>“Pseudo-Spiritual Treasure!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.</p><p>Judging by the opponent's displayed swordsmanship and the grade of this spirit sword, this person's strength was definitely more than what he had shown so far.</p><p>Qin Sang reckoned that he would need to at least cultivate the seventh seal, the Diamond Great Freedom Seal, to Grand Completion before he had a chance of suppressing this opponent without resorting to other methods.</p><p>As soon as this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang pushed off the ground, retreating instead of advancing.</p><p>As he expected, the sword light paused momentarily, then erupted with a roar, piercing through the Buddha seal.</p><p>If Qin Sang had advanced instead of retreating, his situation would have been precarious.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang retreated rapidly, smashing through sections of the stone wall. He stared intently at the approaching sword light and shouted coldly,</p><p>“Who are you? This Daoist has no grievance with you, why this sneak attack?”</p><p>There was no response from the dark river. The sword light pursued him relentlessly, its speed increasing by a third.</p><p>The opponent was a sword cultivator.  Due to the complex underground terrain and the Star Essence infused stone, which grew increasingly harder the higher one went, it wasn't easy for Qin Sang to escape.</p><p>A fierce glint flashed in his eyes.  Instead of drawing his Grey Warbler Sword to confront the opponent head-on, he decided to test the power of the Acquired Wooden Golem Stele!</p><p>With a thought, a green radiance, brimming with vibrant life force and faintly resembling a tree, erupted from Qin Sang.</p><p>The Dao Manifestation Tree had extraordinary origins. Qin Sang didn't dare expose the Spirit Medium Tree Seed like the Strange-Faced Man, so he deliberately concealed it.</p><p>After refining the Dao Manifestation Tree, the tree had taken root within Qin Sang, regaining its vitality.</p><p>Qin Sang silently formed a hand seal, and the green radiance retracted, the tree's shadow disappearing into the earth.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang landed heavily on the ground, the thudding echoing through the underground space.</p><p>Upon landing, Qin Sang's appearance transformed dramatically. His body and limbs elongated, his skin becoming dry and bark-like, his arms and fingers resembling branches, as if he were a tree spirit taking human form.</p><p>The most peculiar change was his Qi, which now seemed to merge with the earth.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the vibrant life force around him, an unprecedented sense of comfort washing over him.</p><p>This was the underground, surrounded by the boundless purple bamboo sea, arguably the most suitable battlefield for this secret technique!</p><p>Qin Sang's perception extended with the secret technique, and the surrounding bamboo resonated in response. The bamboo forest rustled, and the leaves in all directions swayed towards Star Valley.</p><p>The spirits within the bamboo sea also sensed the anomaly, especially those who had transformed from plants.  A primal fear arose within them, compelling them to flee, as far away as possible.</p><p>Boundless Wood Spirit Qi surged towards him. In this moment, Qin Sang felt an inexhaustible power coursing through him!</p><p>Having transformed into a tree man, the underground space immediately felt cramped. Standing upright, he almost touched the ceiling. His eyes shone brightly as he glared at the sword light, formed a hand seal with his right arm, and slammed it forward!</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>His fist connected squarely with the sword light.</p><p>Wood chips seemed to fly through the air, and a golden light flickered on his rough skin.</p><p>Using the Seven Buddha Seals with his Wood Spirit body, the power was truly extraordinary.</p><p>With a clang, Qin Sang's strike shattered the sword light, directly confronting the blade itself!</p><p>The Rotating Altar Seal had the effect of suppressing magical treasures.</p><p>Struck head-on, the spirit sword's light dimmed, its forward momentum abruptly checked.</p><p>The Acquired Wooden Golem Stele, cultivated using the Dao Manifestation Tree, truly possessed remarkable power!</p><p>Furthermore, the secret technique mentioned that absorbing Wood Spirit Qi would place a great burden on the body, and one should be cautious.  However, Qin Sang didn't feel the strain as severely, undoubtedly thanks to the Dao Manifestation Tree.</p><p>This strike boosted Qin Sang's confidence.  It had only been three years since he integrated the Dao Manifestation Tree, and he hadn't mastered many of its divine abilities yet, such as leaping and transforming between surrounding plants, yet he could already withstand a sword cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a hearty laugh, his arm shooting forward, his hand morphing into a claw, attempting to grab the spirit sword directly.</p><p>However, a sword cultivator's sword wasn't so easily seized.</p><p>The spirit sword vibrated, emitting a clear ring, then vanished into thin air.</p><p>In the next instant, a sword light appeared abruptly from the side, slashing towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't even blink, raising his fist and shattering the sword light.</p><p>But then more sword lights appeared from other directions, one after another, as if endless, forcing Qin Sang to remain on high alert.</p><p>If it were any other opponent, they might truly be exhausted by this tactic.</p><p>But Qin Sang was rooted to the earth, the surrounding plants his source of power.  How could he fear such consumption?</p><p>Sword lights shattered before him one after another.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's attention remained fixed on the center of the river.</p><p>Even now, his opponent still hadn't revealed themselves.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly saw through the riverbed.  Although it didn't see the opponent, it noticed something unusual about the earth and stone at the bottom.</p><p>Locking onto the opponent's location, Qin Sang shattered another sword light and suddenly accelerated, sprinting to the riverbank in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At that moment, the spirit sword reappeared above the river's surface, its tip pointing directly at Qin Sang. It unleashed a white streak of energy!</p><p>In this instant, the space above the river seemed to be locked down by this sword light, offering no escape.</p><p>Qin Sang formed the Demon Subduing Seal, pushing it forward. The golden seal clashed with the sword light, and a thunderous boom echoed.  His figure trembled, but he stopped his forward momentum, standing firmly on the riverbank.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The river parted, and a Daoist in azure robes flew out.</p><p>This person was tall and slender, appearing to be around thirty years old, with sword-like eyebrows and bright, piercing eyes. He beckoned the spirit sword back into his hand, looked at Qin Sang, and revealed a surprised expression.</p><p>“Eh? A demon? No! What kind of spell is this?”</p><p>Seeing this person, Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly.  He didn't continue his attack, but asked in a deep voice, “Who are you?”</p><p>“You don't know me?”  The Daoist was slightly taken aback, looking him up and down. “You're not from Lingdu Mountain?”</p><p>“Lingdu Mountain?” Qin Sang couldn't recall such a sect and shook his head slightly.</p><p>The Daoist's face showed a hint of embarrassment.  He waved his hand.  “A misunderstanding! A misunderstanding! This Daoist thought it was a great enemy pursuing me, I didn't expect an outsider would come to such a place.”</p><p>“Misunderstanding?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  He had been sneak-attacked. If not for his abilities, he might very well be dead.  Could this be explained away as a mere misunderstanding?</p><p>The Daoist sheathed his sword and bowed meticulously. “It was this Daoist's fault.  I hope fellow Daoist will not take offense.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't revert from his Wood Spirit form, but he didn't attack either, merely watching the other person with indifference.</p><p>The opponent's apology might be a pretense, seeing that he wasn't easy to deal with, or it could be sincere.</p><p>However, that wasn't important. From this person, Qin Sang vaguely sensed a dangerous aura.</p><p>This person's true strength was likely far greater than what he had shown!</p><p>Although his divine sense was currently limited, his spiritual perception was far beyond that of an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator, yet he couldn't see through this person.</p><p>Could it be that the other party was also a Deity Transformation cultivator?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart tightened. His strength hadn't fully recovered, and facing a cultivator of the same realm, he would be at a disadvantage, his chances of victory slim.</p><p>Secretly observing the person, Qin Sang, though uncertain, felt a distinct threat and became even more vigilant.</p><p>He also realized that the opponent clearly possessed greater strength but hadn't used it, likely due to some hidden constraint, just like himself.</p><p>It seemed that this person's opponent was quite powerful. Perhaps he had been injured by his enemy or was under some other restriction.</p><p>“This Daoist was at a crucial juncture in refining a treasure, with most of my mind focused on it, unable to be distracted. Fearing that my enemy would sabotage me, I could only strike first.  Fellow Daoist should be able to understand,” the Daoist explained vaguely, seeing that Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>So that was it.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. This person’s inability to use his full power was likely related to that treasure.</p><p>“Since this is a misunderstanding, this Daoist is willing to make amends. As long as fellow Daoist doesn’t make things difficult for me, I will do one thing for you in the future, or if fellow Daoist requires any treasures, as long as this Daoist can manage it,” the Daoist bowed again.</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid that this poor Daoist will inform your enemy upon returning?”  Qin Sang’s tone was indifferent.</p><p>The Daoist said helplessly, “To be honest with fellow Daoist, I would very much like to detain you for a while, but it's not advisable to make enemies at this time, and facing fellow Daoist, I feel somewhat uneasy.  You seem to possess methods that could threaten me.”</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
