**Refining the Corpse**

Qin Sang understood that this was akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack—whether he could find Senior Qingzhu relied solely on luck. He couldn’t afford to expend too much effort on this; the task at hand was to cultivate diligently.

He suppressed the conflicting thoughts running through his head and walked over to the pool. When he saw that the spring water was crystal clear and that the flower was in full bloom, he took the tree root out and placed it above the spring, allowing it to be washed by the spiritual spring water. As for whether it would work or not, he had no idea and could only wait for the results patiently.

Even if the root could expedite the ripening of the spiritual spring water, it wouldn’t take effect within a day or two. Qin Sang cast a barrier over the pool once more and ignored it.

He sat down in meditation on the stone bed and took out the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood.

The Ebony Sword forged the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood, only requiring Qin Sang’s help when swallowing the spirit wood. For the forging process after that, the Ebony Sword could absorb the strength of the soul and the intent to kill and refine it on its own. All Qin Sang needed to do was to house it in his soul.

The duration of this process depended on Qin Sang’s cultivation level and on the materials of the spirit wood. As Qin Sang’s cultivation increased, the speed would become faster.

The better the quality of the spirit wood, the longer it would take.

However, the power of the spirit sword would also be stronger when it was finished.

Of course, it was best not to use the spirit sword before it was finished, because the power of an unfinished spirit sword would be greatly reduced. Moreover, it could be easily destroyed if it suffered a major blow. By that point, all his painstaking effort would be in vain, and he would be overcome with regret.

In the world of the immortals, the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood could only be considered a lower-quality spirit wood. It would take less than a month to finish forging it. If it was one of the legendary Ten Great Sacred Trees, it might take several tens of years, and the process would be even more complicated.

The miscellaneous matters outside had mostly been handled, and Qin Sang didn’t intend to go out during this period. For the time being, he would first refine the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood.

A flash of sword light.

Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword and hovered it in front of him. At the same time, he held up the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood and examined the wood pattern on it closely. At the same time, he also enveloped this piece of spirit wood with his divine consciousness, analyzing the distribution of the wood element strength in it.

This process was very tedious and had to be meticulous, brooking no errors.

Alchemists and artificers were the most adept at doing such things, and Qin Sang had borrowed insights into forging artifacts from Shopkeeper Wu which contained relevant expositions. It wasn’t difficult to get started and he soon became proficient.

After an hour, Qin Sang completely understood the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood. With a move of his will, the Ebony Sword trembled slightly, flying over to the top of the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood. The sword talisman on the body of the sword suddenly flickered brightly, surging with sword qi as it enveloped the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood.

Under Qin Sang’s divine consciousness’s control, the sword qi turned into thousands of strands, some thick and some thin, complex as a spider’s web. Then, under Qin Sang’s guidance, they entered the spirit wood.

The sword qi grew stronger and stronger, and during this process, the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood was directly cut into countless fragments by the sword qi. However, the wood element strength on each fragment was still intact, extremely pure.

The useless wood shavings were refined out, falling lightly like snowflakes. One green dot of light after another appeared in the air, like fireflies.

Qin Sang nodded secretly and flicked his finger slightly at the Ebony Sword.

Swish!

Immediately, the Ebony Sword surged with an incredibly powerful suction force, drawing all the green dots of light into the body of the sword. As they merged in, the slender Ebony Sword expanded and contracted erratically, its shape changing indefinitely.

Immediately, Qin Sang infused spiritual energy into the body of the sword and activated the sword talisman, helping the Ebony Sword suppress those wood element strengths.

Before long, the Ebony Sword gradually stabilized. A look of joy came over Qin Sang’s face as he retracted it to be nurtured by his soul. He only needed to thoroughly refine the Gold-Silk Snow Pine wood to return it to its original state.

After doing this, Qin Sang cultivated in silence for a while, recovering the divine consciousness and spiritual energy that he had just expended. Then, he reached out and flicked his finger on the mustard seed pod, upon which items flew out of it one after another, neatly arrayed before Qin Sang.

The corpse of the White Cloud Mountain Man was sealed in an ice coffin. His silver hair still had a faint luster, appearing to be just as it had when he had just died.

There was a wound from the Five Elements Breaking Talisman Sword on his chest. Even more horrifying was the color of his skin: before he had died, he had been pierced by a poison needle and snake venom had entered his body. His entire body was a strange greenish black.

However, as long as the area of his dantian hadn’t been damaged, the corpse was intact, and so there were no issues in refining the fiendish corpse.

In the slender, narrow Small Yin Magnetic Bottle was earth fiendish qi. The first time Qin Sang had refined a fiendish corpse, he had taken two bottles as a precaution.

Next came the five elements of yin objects.

The Nine Aperture Stone with holes all over its surface.

A small piece of azure-green Blue Nether Metal.

A jade bottle containing Yin Spirit Water.

A piece of Moon Acacia Wood, pure as ivory moonlight and the length of a forearm, which had an aura that made one’s soul feel at peace.

The last was bone devil-feather, the middle of the feather with the yin fire was burning and emitting the chill.
Then, Qin Sang took out a gray and white spirit from the puppet bag, which was the combination of the soul of a demon beast.
All the materials for refining the baleful corpse were ready. Qin Sang didn’t start yet but calmed his soul, then recalled the “Heavenly Yin Corpse Art” several times, to make sure there was no detail missing, then pointed at the ice coffin.
"Bang!"
The ice coffin fell into pieces, and the corpse of White Cloud Taoist flew out and stood before Qin Sang.
Qin Sang’s face was a little gloomy, then his divine sense opened and covered the body of White Cloud Taoist. One person and one corpse faced each other, the cave house fell into an eerie silence.
After a long time, Qin Sang suddenly lifted his hands, the handprint changed, the divine sense connected with the spiritual force, a peculiar restriction quickly formed in his hand, then hit the left arm of White Cloud Taoist.
The restriction entered the body and disappeared. White Cloud Taoist looked unchanged.
Qin Sang became quicker on the other hand, his fingers changing rapidly, showing streaks of afterimages, hard for normal eyes to tell, restrictions formed in his hands quickly, then quickly hit different parts of the body of White Cloud Taoist.
As time went by, the restrictions became more, and the body of White Cloud Taoist finally started to change. His qi and blood were refined by the restriction, becoming venomous baleful qi, his whole body looked skinnier.
Then, his facial features sank, two fangs grew out of his exposed gums, and his fingernails also grew quickly, sharp as a knife.
At the same time, the body of White Cloud Taoist started to emit dense baleful qi, the corpse poison gas of the fangs and fingernails turned dark green under the influence of the baleful qi.
Meanwhile, the bones and skin of White Cloud Taoist were also changing, as if they were being refined into magical equipment, becoming hard.
Although you could still tell what White Cloud Taoist looked like, it was more like a mummy than a person.
At that time, White Cloud Taoist was slowly changing into a baleful corpse. If White Cloud Taoist was put in a place with dense yin qi, it could absorb yin qi on its own and, if undisturbed for many years, could develop spirituality and become a baleful corpse.
Demon Sect had corpse-refining arts, which could accelerate the process.
However, according to the steps of “Heavenly Yin Corpse Art”, this was just the beginning.
