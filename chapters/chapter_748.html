<h1>Chapter 740: Bottleneck</h1><p>Qin Sang attempted to cultivate the cultivation technique created by Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>Initially, the comprehension process went very smoothly, as it was derived from the original technique.</p><p>But when Qin Sang actually started cultivating, attempting to inscribe the sixth Killing Rune onto his natal spirit sword, he encountered problems.</p><p>First, the new Killing Rune wasn't as effective in assisting cultivation as a true Killing Rune.</p><p>With a true Killing Rune, Qin Sang's cultivation speed should be comparable to a cultivator with dual spiritual roots, truly stepping into the ranks of the elite.</p><p>Currently, there was still a significant gap.</p><p>Second, the Killing Rune created by Senior Qingzhu wasn't perfect. Although Qin Sang could cultivate it, it wasn't fully compatible with him. There was a risk of collapse if he wasn't careful, so the requirements for both the cultivator and the natal spirit sword were extremely high.</p><p>As a result, if the Ebony Sword wasn't upgraded, it might not be able to withstand the full power of the complete Killing Rune.</p><p>In other words, Qin Sang would face the awkward situation of his natal spirit sword collapsing midway through his cultivation in the mid-Core Formation stage. The bottleneck would arrive prematurely, catching him off guard.</p><p>The situation was more severe than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>“A bottleneck! A bottleneck! I only have a few decades left, and there's still no news. Searching aimlessly, can I really find the Ten Divine Trees? Do I really have to wait until I return to the Small Cold Realm and search for the Eternal Bloodwood in the Cliffless Valley?”</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, looking up at the ceiling of his cave dwelling with an indifferent expression.</p><p>The "Soul-Nurturing Sword Chapter" was too unique. Switching to other cultivation techniques would not only reduce his cultivation speed back to the level of a five-spiritual root cultivator but also come at an unbearable cost, potentially losing his chance to reach Nascent Soul.</p><p>Even if there was a sliver of hope, Qin Sang wouldn't entertain that thought.</p><p>“The good news is that the cultivation technique created by Senior Qingzhu isn't that profound, and there are clues to follow. Within certain limits, even if I can't inscribe the Killing Rune, I can still comprehend most of its true meaning. Once I find a suitable spiritual wood and upgrade the Ebony Sword, inscribing the Killing Rune will be much easier and faster. However, the time gained this way is also limited, and this problem will eventually surface.”</p><p>“There's another way, which is to incorporate refining techniques while inscribing the Killing Rune. Continuing to delve into the Dao of Refining should allow me to inscribe a few more strokes. Fortunately, I had this idea before, so it's a precautionary measure.  I've made some progress, and there's a good chance it will work.”</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang sighed, “These are all temporary solutions, not addressing the root cause.”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang continued his secluded cultivation.</p><p>While cultivating, he also contemplated how to approach the problem from the perspective of refining techniques, enabling the Ebony Sword to bear more Killing Runes.</p><p>Time flew by, and more than two years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>During these two years, Qin Sang barely left his cave dwelling.</p><p>He devoted himself to cultivation, studying refining techniques and restriction formations, conducting various experiments, and experiencing countless failures. Finally, he developed some rudimentary refining restrictions that could stabilize the Ebony Sword.</p><p>This was still a prototype, with much room for improvement.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, due to the cultivation technique, I ended up in seclusion here for so long. This wasn't part of the plan. There are less than three years until the Seven Kills Palace opens. After touring the entire Demon Sea, it'll be quite rushed to go to the Inner Sea. I can't just skim through it. It's better to spend the remaining time in the Demon Sea and stay in the Inner Sea for a while after coming out of the Seven Kills Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the cave dwelling, made his decision, summoned his Two-Headed Serpent to confirm his direction, and his figure disappeared into the azure sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Great Wilderness Island.</p><p>The gateway for human cultivators to enter the Demon Sea.</p><p>Like Skywitch Island, this island was heavily guarded and extremely vast, resembling a small continent. It was a rare large island in the Demon Sea. Not only were there cultivators coming and going, but there were also mortals farming.</p><p>More than fifty years after teleporting here, Qin Sang set foot on Great Wilderness Island for the first time.</p><p>Legend had it that Great Wilderness Island was the first island occupied by cultivators entering the Demon Sea, holding extraordinary significance.  Back then, the Demon Sea was a truly wild and untamed place.</p><p>In reality, it wasn't much better now. The areas occupied by the two races of cultivators were still insignificant compared to the entire Demon Sea.</p><p>He stood before the city gate, gazing at the massive city.</p><p>After nearly three years of travel, Qin Sang had visited almost all the islands in the Demon Sea, experiencing both gains and disappointments.</p><p>Upon arriving at each location, Qin Sang's first priority was to inquire about any news regarding the emergence of the Ten Divine Trees. To this end, he actively interacted with many people, from trusted aides of island lords to solitary rogue cultivators.</p><p>The Demon Sea was a treasure trove.  Not only were there demonic beasts, but with luck, one could also discover spiritual herbs and wondrous flowers on uncharted islands.</p><p>For example, the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet on Red Leaf Island.</p><p>Searching for the Ten Divine Trees in the Demon Sea, though a long shot, wasn't entirely impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang's escape technique was unique, and he dared to venture into even the most dangerous places.  However, frustratingly, there wasn't even a rumor, let alone any concrete news.</p><p>He could only pin his hopes on the Inner Sea.</p><p>The Inner Sea had been occupied by cultivators since ancient times, with ancient legacies. Among the various legends, there might be clues to be found.  Perhaps some top-tier sects even possessed Ten Divine Trees without anyone knowing.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the city, bypassing the shops. With a clear goal in mind, he headed straight for a small courtyard within the city.</p><p>‘Knock, knock…’</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and knocked on the gate.</p><p>The courtyard appeared no different from the neighboring ones, with an ordinary wooden gate.</p><p>However, the information Qin Sang received from Old Zou directed him here, to meet with other cultivators from the East Pole Alliance and enter the Seven Kills Palace together.</p><p>Qin Sang held a certain reverence for a colossal entity like the East Pole Alliance. Although there were no signs of restrictions around the courtyard, he didn't casually use his divine sense to probe.</p><p>‘Creak…’</p><p>Soon, the wooden gate was pushed open from the inside, and a kind-looking old man emerged.</p><p>“What business do you have, senior?”</p><p>Although the old man was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, he faced Qin Sang with neither subservience nor arrogance.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke gently, “Old sir, I purchased a token some time ago and was told to retrieve something here. This is my proof. Please inform the owner.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang handed over the token from the瓊宇 Trading Company.</p><p>A glint flashed in the old man's eyes.  He took the token and examined it carefully, then a smile appeared on his face, “So it's Daoist Qingfeng. My master has been expecting you. Please follow me.”</p><p>Qin Sang followed the old man into the courtyard and discovered that it was much larger than it appeared from the outside, with several exquisite wooden buildings and shimmering protective formations of considerable power.</p><p>The old man led Qin Sang to one of the wooden buildings and bowed, “My master is currently visiting someone and will return in the evening. Please rest here for a while, Daoist.”</p><p>“Very well.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, stood before the building, and looked towards the other structures.</p><p>From these buildings, Qin Sang sensed faint auras, indicating that others had already arrived.</p>
