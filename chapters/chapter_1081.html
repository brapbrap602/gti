<h1>Chapter 173 Soul's Return</h1><p>“Elder Yin was betrayed by you!”</p><p>At this moment, the Demon Lord finally understood.</p><p>Elder Yin had mentioned this person many times, recommending him to the Demon Lord. However, the Demon Lord had been preoccupied with the Demon Slaying Stele plot and hadn't paid much attention.</p><p>This person was a spy for the Ancient Demon!</p><p>The Demon Lord glanced at Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi frowned.</p><p>“You want me to help you break the ancient seal and release him? You're delusional!”</p><p>The Ancient Demon, repeatedly provoked, was now enraged, wanting nothing more than to devour Mo Qingzhu alive.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu remained indifferent, his expression calm. “The Demon Monarch told me to tell you, it's either a return to his true form, or soul annihilation, or even imprisonment and soul searching. You know what to do! I…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, Mo Qingzhu's body suddenly trembled, his aura fluctuating violently.</p><p>His expression contorted as he swiftly suppressed his true soul, roaring,</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>This sudden change surprised everyone, unsure what had happened to Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>While Mo Qingzhu and the Ancient Demon were conversing, the others had been communicating secretly, deciding to launch a joint attack, aiming to eliminate the seemingly weaker Mo Qingzhu first with lightning speed.</p><p>Although the ancient seal showed no abnormalities, and they didn't know what this person had done, eliminating him first couldn't hurt. Then they could deal with the Ancient Demon.</p><p>Seeing Mo Qingzhu's strange aura, everyone was about to strike.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a faint shout emanated from within Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>“Sword Soul, return!”</p><p>As soon as the words were spoken, a figure flashed down from above, accompanied by the sound of something tearing through the air.</p><p>Everyone looked up in astonishment.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi's face was full of surprise.</p><p>He recognized this person.</p><p>This person was Ning Wu Hui, a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect, content to be a gatekeeper. Although seemingly ordinary, he possessed decent talent and had earned the qualification to enter the Trial Realm.</p><p>This time, Ling Zhuzi had led his disciples into the Seven Kill Hall, and Ning Wu Hui was among them. However, because Ning Wu Hui kept a low profile in the sect, Ling Zhuzi knew little about him.</p><p>But how did he, with only late Core Formation cultivation, enter the Spirit Suppression Domain?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi was about to question him.</p><p>But he saw a flash of light from Ning Wu Hui's crown, and a Nascent Soul leaped out, clutching an unknown fragment. It darted towards Mo Qingzhu and merged into his body.</p><p>“External Nascent Soul!”</p><p>The Demon Lord instantly recognized the Nascent Soul's nature.</p><p>As the Nascent Soul entered his body, Mo Qingzhu's expression froze, then turned to fury.</p><p>His aura became chaotic, his face twisting grotesquely as if possessed, his eyes bloodshot. Then, half of his face gradually returned to normal.</p><p>The same face, yet giving off a completely different feeling.</p><p>One side demonic, the other human!</p><p>Seeing this, everyone vaguely guessed what was happening and paused their actions.</p><p>A stalemate ensued, but it was clear that the normal side was gaining the upper hand, gradually suppressing the demonic soul.</p><p>“Who are you? I am not the Sword Soul!”</p><p>A roar filled with resentment, the voice of the demonic soul, echoed from within Qingzhu.</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>Qingzhu's true soul, now dominant, his eyes regaining clarity, let out a barely audible sigh. “You were originally the killing intent I split off to cultivate my technique. I could suppress you initially, but I was severely injured upon arriving here and nearly overtaken by you. I had no choice but to seal you within Mount Ethereal. Unexpectedly, an Ancient Demon lurked within the mountain. When I returned for you, you were gone, corrupted by the Ancient Demon, becoming its pawn, committing boundless slaughter! Fortunately, you hadn't discovered the seal on your memories, unaware of your true origins.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The demonic soul was shocked, instantly realizing something. “That jade slip within the sword path…”</p><p>Qingzhu hummed in affirmation. “The jade slip was left for you! Your cultivation progressed far faster than I anticipated, loosening the seal on your memories. I had to resort to this, leaving the jade slip to lure you to me. You and I are one, a divided soul, neither truly dominant. When I found you, your cultivation surpassed mine. If you regained your memories and sought me out, intent on merging, I would be powerless to resist. If we merged, we would become a crazed demon of pure slaughter. The Sword Soul is different, forged from the technique, its soul infused with sword light, forming a demonic seed. To usurp its master, it must first suppress my soul, devouring it when I'm defenseless. Only by misleading you, making you believe you are the Sword Soul, could I buy time, reinforce the seal within you, and wait for the right moment…”</p><p>While Qingzhu and the demonic soul clashed, within his body, the Sword Soul Nascent Soul released the fragment it held, using it to suppress the demonic soul.</p><p>At the core of the demonic soul was another fragment, fused with a strange restriction, now being activated by Qingzhu's true soul.</p><p>Apart from their different shapes, they were clearly fragments of the same treasure.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The two fragments collided and merged, revealing sharp edges on both sides, unmistakably part of some spiritual sword!</p><p>On the sword's surface, the ancient character also became complete, the character for 'Kill'!</p><p>As the two fragments fused, the Killing Sword fragment shimmered, emitting a strange power like sword light.</p><p>The demonic soul shrieked, unwilling to submit, fiercely resisting.</p><p>Empowered by the Killing Sword fragment, the restriction grew stronger, and Qingzhu's true soul gained the upper hand.</p><p>Externally, the madness in Qingzhu's eyes gradually faded.</p><p>He had willingly drawn the demonic soul into himself, enduring humiliation and resistance for decades.</p><p>He had sent his clone into the Trial Realm, gathered Earth Blood Ginseng, cultivated an external Nascent Soul, and entered the Nether Valley to retrieve the other fragment of the Killing Sword.</p><p>Finally, today, he had turned the tables!</p><p>Resealing the demonic soul was now a certainty!</p><p>The Demon Lord and the others were all discerning individuals. Although Qingzhu's two souls were communicating within his Purple Mansion, they could guess the general situation from his changes.</p><p>“You are also just a split soul! Haha!”</p><p>The Ancient Demon laughed wildly, gloating, then his smile vanished as he lunged towards the crevice in the ground.</p><p>His true form was superior, pushing him into a desperate situation. Escape was impossible; only one path remained.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Everyone shouted in unison.</p><p>While sealing the demonic soul, Qingzhu revealed shocking news, “Quickly kill this demon! The Witch Clan has also been lured here…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Southern Return Fairy was startled. “The Demon Sealing Restriction is a joint restriction of the Human, Witch, and Demon Clans!”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the ancient hall.</p><p>Qin Sang stood hidden on the cliff edge, observing from afar.</p><p>His previous guess had been confirmed. The gray aura protected him as he left the ancient hall unharmed.</p><p>True demonic Qi permeated the area, filled with top experts. He dared not approach, only observing from a distance. What he saw and heard were fragmented pieces, unclear about the hidden secrets, only able to guess.</p><p>Famous human experts appeared one after another, the situation changing rapidly, dazzling to behold.</p><p>Until Qingzhu appeared, and hearing his shout, a spark ignited in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Others might not know, but he knew that Qingzhu had once split his own soul to cultivate the *Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit Scripture*!</p><p>The battle erupted once more.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. Suddenly, Bai said, “The Fire Curse Seed is reacting. Mou Laomo is faking his death!”</p>
