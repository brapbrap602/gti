<h1>Chapter 573: Ghostly Howls and the Jade Buddha</h1><p>A seemingly endless necropolis stretched before them.</p><p>Duke Dongyang called it the Immortal Graveyard.</p><p>However, no one knew why such a vast graveyard existed within the Immortal Palace, who built it, or what lay buried within the tombs.</p><p>Immortals?</p><p>Or mortals?</p><p>These ancient tombs, weathered by the passage of time, had become low and crumbled. Many were cracked, and some had even collapsed entirely.</p><p>Most of the tombstones were destroyed. Even those that remained were mere fragments, their inscriptions lost to time.</p><p>Qin Sang even spotted a broken spear, mostly buried in the earth, covered in rust.</p><p>Though its glory was obscured by rust, the spear still commanded attention. In its complete form, it must have been a terrifying weapon. Now, powerless, it lay forgotten in the earth.</p><p>Fragments like the broken spear were numerous, their power eroded by time, reduced to mere scrap metal.</p><p>Where there was decay, there might also be treasure.</p><p>The Immortal Graveyard could also be a treasure trove.</p><p>The Diamond Wheel hovered above, its light forming a protective barrier around Qin Sang and his four companions.</p><p>Within the ghostly mist, faint spectral figures appeared. Detecting the intruders, they shrieked and lunged, claws outstretched. The mist churned, and unseen currents stirred.</p><p>'Tsssss!'</p><p>As the ghostly mist touched the Diamond Wheel's white light, it seemed to ignite, emitting a piercing sound as it rapidly dissipated.</p><p>The spectral figures hidden within the mist fared even worse. Upon contact with the Diamond Wheel's light, they let out brief cries before vanishing completely.</p><p>Perhaps because they were at the graveyard's edge, these spectral figures were weak. Under the Diamond Wheel's protection, Qin Sang and his companions felt little danger from the mist.</p><p>However, Duke Dongyang and Chenyan became noticeably more cautious.</p><p>Surrounded by tombs, there was almost no solid ground. Even seemingly level areas were collapsed graves, creating an unsettling feeling underfoot.</p><p>They proceeded cautiously.</p><p>The spectral figures they encountered grew stronger, but the two Nascent Soul cultivators handled them with ease.</p><p>Wary of disturbing powerful Ghost Kings, comparable to Nascent Soul cultivators, they advanced on foot. Their progress was slow, yet after half an hour, they were still within the seemingly endless graveyard.</p><p>The graveyard's expanse already exceeded the palace they had seen earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed.</p><p>Just how many were buried here?</p><p>What kind of horrific slaughter could claim so many lives?</p><p>Fortunately, despite the graveyard's vastness, the spectral beings weren't as numerous as he'd imagined.</p><p>The spectral world also seemed to have a strict hierarchy. The weaker spirits dared only linger at the edges, clustered together, creating an illusion of greater numbers.</p><p>Deeper within the graveyard, they sometimes traveled long distances without encountering a single spectral being.</p><p>Moving silently among countless tombs, after another quarter of an hour, Duke Dongyang and Chenyan suddenly stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others looked around curiously, but saw nothing.</p><p>A moment later, Duke Dongyang said gravely, "It's Dongyun Xian! He seems to have encountered a powerful spectral being. Judging by the sounds, he's struggling. I've heard there are Ghost Kings here, rivaling mid-Nascent Soul cultivators in strength. It seems Dongyun Xian has run into one!"</p><p>Chenyan glanced at Duke Dongyang. "Do you intend to help him?"</p><p>"Certainly not."</p><p>Duke Dongyang sneered. "Though our two realms have agreed to cooperate, within the Violet Palace, we are still rivals. That old fox Dongyun Xian is tougher than he looks; he won't die. We can use this opportunity, while he distracts the Ghost King, to slip past and gain an advantage."</p><p>With that, Duke Dongyang gestured towards the Diamond Wheel, and its light dimmed.</p><p>The seven figures suppressed their auras, becoming nearly invisible within the ghostly mist. They skirted the battle ahead, quickening their pace.</p><p>As they passed near the battle, Dongyun Xian, locked in combat with the Ghost King, sensed their presence.</p><p>He wielded a flute-like magical treasure, conjuring countless flute phantoms that lashed out at the Ghost King, nearly tearing it in half.</p><p>Dongyun Xian glanced back, his brow furrowing.</p><p>Just then, the Ghost King, flung back by the flute, flickered and instantly regenerated, lunging back into the fray, giving Dongyun Xian no chance to disengage.</p><p>"You fool!" Dongyun Xian roared furiously.</p><p>He couldn't afford to be distracted, focusing entirely on the Ghost King.</p><p>Meanwhile, Duke Dongyang and the others pressed on, ignoring the fierce battle beside them.</p><p>As they neared the battle, the ghostly howls intensified, becoming piercingly sharp, like a demonic melody that burrowed into their minds.  They tried everything to dispel it, but the sound continued to affect their consciousness.</p><p>The closer they got, the stronger the howls' influence became. Yu Wansen was the first to show signs of distress. His face paled, sweat beaded on his forehead, and his eyes glazed over with brief moments of confusion.</p><p>At first, Yu Wansen snapped out of it quickly, but the intervals of confusion grew longer, and his fear intensified with each recovery.  His back was drenched in sweat.</p><p>He attempted to use the howls to temper his spirit, but it proved futile.</p><p>After a few more steps, Yu Wansen could no longer endure it.  He relied on the Diamond Wheel to seal his senses, minimizing the howls' effect. His condition immediately improved.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and Ji Qing followed suit.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and Qiu Mubai also sealed their senses.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang hadn't been affected by the ghostly howls.  Years ago, in the Heavenly Corpse Cave, he'd encountered demonic sounds similar to these howls, and his Jade Buddha had shielded him.</p><p>This time, the Jade Buddha again effortlessly blocked the howls, safeguarding Qin Sang completely, bringing him immense peace of mind.</p><p>Even the howls of a Ghost King comparable to a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator couldn't shake the Jade Buddha in the slightest!</p><p>Though still some distance away, Qin Sang's mind remained completely unaffected. He imagined that even if the Ghost King appeared before him, it would be the same.</p><p>Throughout their journey, the Jade Buddha had repeatedly proven its power and reliability, never disappointing Qin Sang.</p><p>To avoid arousing suspicion from Duke Dongyang and Chenyan, Qin Sang feigned distress and sealed his senses. After an unknown period, his senses returned.</p><p>The mist and tombs were gone. They had finally left the Immortal Graveyard.</p><p>Behind them lay the gray-white ghostly mist. Ahead stretched a vast open space, the earth as dark and blood-soaked as that of the graveyard.</p><p>At the far end of the open space stood a massive earthen altar.</p><p>Shaped like a pyramid, its peak reached into the clouds. Scarlet baleful energy swirled around it, interspersed with ancient restrictive formations.</p><p>Duke Dongyang and Chenyan led them forward, flying, but they bypassed the altar.</p><p>Perhaps they lacked the means to break through the altar's ancient restrictions.</p>
