<h1></h1><p>Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled leisurely, unhurried.</p><p>Today was the day of the Outer Disciple Competition.</p><p>Presiding over the competition was Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>She and her Dao Companion were a pair of lovebirds, deeply devoted to each other, an enviable Immortal Couple in the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>The arena was set up on the bank of a great river, located at the highest peak of the outer sect. Standing on the summit, one could catch a glimpse of the inner sect's scenery, thus inspiring the outer disciples.</p><p>Cheers erupted from the mountaintop from time to time.</p><p>This was the final match of the competition, which would determine the ultimate victor.</p><p>The outer disciples surrounded the arena in droves, cheering for both sides, and even some inner sect male disciples came out to watch the excitement.</p><p>On the arena.</p><p>One side was a young man dressed in yellow, whose appearance and temperament could be described as ordinary.</p><p>The other side was a beautiful maiden in flowing white robes.</p><p>The maiden had skin as white as snow and a refined, aloof aura.</p><p>She held a spirit sword, its body as crystalline as if forged from mystic ice, as cold and beautiful as she was.</p><p>Everyone has a love for beauty.</p><p>Obviously, most of the people were there to see the maiden, and the cheers drowned out even the roar of the great river. A few companions, out of loyalty, cheered the young man on, but the sounds they made were so faint that even they couldn't hear them, so they simply defected.</p><p>"Senior Sister Lu, go!"</p><p>"Take him down!"</p><p>"I bet this kid can take five moves from Junior Sister Lu."</p><p>"Three moves at most..."</p><p>...</p><p>The protective barrier around the arena couldn't block out sound.</p><p>The young man was drowned in layers of sound, lonely and helpless, clutching a pitch-black fire poker, at a loss, looking somewhat pitiful.</p><p>The maiden's expression didn't show any conceit, her red lips parted slightly, "Junior Brother Zhang, I didn't expect you to be my final opponent, please enlighten me!"</p><p>But the young man seemed absent-minded, his eyes vacant.</p><p>He seemed to be stunned by the grand scene around the arena.</p><p>The maiden frowned.</p><p>At this moment, the outer sect steward announced the start of the competition.</p><p>As clever as the maiden was, she could see that her opponent's eyes were off, but her will was firm, and she wouldn't be affected by it, no matter who her opponent was, she would go all out!</p><p>The maiden beckoned with her right hand, and the spirit sword left her palm, flying into the air.</p><p>Sword energy vibrated, the maiden's clothes fluttered, making the people outside the arena stare blankly, and cheers resounded throughout the outer sect.</p><p>In contrast, the young man seemed to wake up from a dream, hastily raising the pitch-black fire poker in his hand.</p><p>As expected, it caused a burst of laughter.</p><p>It was hard to imagine who would refine such an unsightly magical artifact , yet the young man relied on this magical artifact to advance through the stages and stand on the final arena.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>The spirit sword mercilessly slashed down, transforming into a blue sword ray.</p><p>Stimulated by the sword ray, the fire poker also burst out with a dazzling green light, rising into the sky in an instant.</p><p>The green and blue lights converged, colliding fiercely.</p><p>For a time, the loud noise was like thunder, the figures of the two became blurred, and the green and blue intertwined light swept outside the arena, causing the protective barrier to vibrate frequently.</p><p>The audience closest to the arena's barrier were shocked, and instinctively leaned back.</p><p>Seeing that the barrier was as strong as ever, they breathed a sigh of relief, looking at the two fighting on the arena with surprised faces, they didn't expect such power from just one exchange.</p><p>The maiden was also taken aback, the fire poker opposite not only could contend with her spirit sword, but also had a strange suction force, causing the spiritual power in her body to be unstable, and even showing signs of boiling.</p><p>Clearly, the young man's cultivation level  was a level below hers.</p><p>This battle must not be lost!</p><p>The maiden gritted her silver teeth, no longer hesitated, and immediately activated a secret art she had mastered not long ago.</p><p>"Divine Sword Lightning Control Art!"</p><p>Along with her delicate shout, the spirit sword let out a long hum, a flash of blue light, suddenly turned into a beam of light, with amazing power, slashed towards the young man!</p><p>"What! Junior Sister Lu has already learned the Divine Sword Lightning Control Art!"</p><p>"Worthy of being a genius!"</p><p>...</p><p>The crowd exclaimed.</p><p>The light beam was like a thunderbolt, its momentum was earth-shattering, as if it wanted to split the mountain peak.</p><p>Of course, it couldn't have the power of a real heavenly lightning, nor was it the thunderous sound of sword energy, but a sword art treasured by the Azure Goat Temple. For the maiden to be able to refine this sword art at her cultivation level, she could be called a swordplay genius.</p><p>Outside the arena, Bai Hanqiu looked at the maiden with a look of praise, while a steward beside her looked at the young man nervously, his eyes faintly carrying a hint of expectation.</p><p>In front of the young man, there was no other barrier except the fire poker.</p><p>His face was distorted, blood flowed from his seven orifices, he grabbed the fire poker, at the top of the pitch-black fire poker was a circular crystal, vaguely showing a trace of blood color, and slammed into the beam of light.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A thunderous sound.</p><p>The arena shook violently.</p><p>The blue and green light were almost indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>The crowd fell silent, watching the arena with tense faces.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>Suddenly, the blue light dimmed, flying backwards, the maiden's face was pale, her breath was weak, her spiritual power was almost exhausted, barely stabilizing her figure.</p><p>But the young man spat out blood, and fell out of the arena like a broken rag.</p><p>"Junior Sister Lu won!"</p><p>After a brief silence, the crowd cheered excitedly.</p><p>But the maiden didn't say a word, standing there blankly, looking at the young man in a daze.</p><p>"Useless!"</p><p>The steward was heartbroken and could naturally see that the young man had retreated at the last moment.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's eyes, however, weren't bad.</p><p>Just as she was about to say something, she suddenly saw an ethereal figure outside the crowd, gently nodding at her, she thought she was seeing things, and quickly fixed her eyes to look carefully.</p><p>After whispering a few words to the steward, Bai Hanqiu, disregarding the gazes of the disciples, transformed into a ray of light and flew into the inner sect, seeing Qin Sang strolling in the mountains, she obediently followed behind, "Disciple greets Master, Master also watched the disciples' competition just now?"</p><p>"In the days of youth, filled with spirit and vigor. This Master  am using this to reminisce about the old days."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>In fact, he encountered too many twists and turns at the beginning of his cultivation, and had no chance to participate in the sect's great competition.</p><p>Even after entering Shaohua Mountain, he would avoid such things if possible.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't blame her, Bai Hanqiu breathed a sigh of relief, finding something to say, "That male disciple doesn't know where he got the opportunity, the magical artifact in his hand may have some origin, Senior Brother Tan said that it has the potential to advance to a treasure  in the future..."</p><p>"It is a blood refining evil artifact, but don't worry about it. Magical artifacts have no right or wrong, it all depends on the owner's heart."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded indifferently, he knew what Bai Hanqiu was afraid of.</p><p>He had been in closed-door cultivation for so many years, and Bai Hanqiu's cultivation had not improved much, it seemed that she had given up her path.</p><p>This was Bai Hanqiu's own choice, and Qin Sang would not interfere.</p><p>Changing his tone, Qin Sang asked: "Has the Han family moved out of Da Sui?"</p><p>Bai Hanqiu nodded repeatedly, reporting to Qin Sang.</p><p>Da Sui was the Azure Goat Temple's land of rising, Jiang Xue was sensible, ordered the Han Family Fortress to move away, ceding Da Sui and the surrounding large areas to the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Tan Yien knew the significance of Da Sui to Qin Sang, and sent stewards to sit in charge, sealing Pilgrimage Mountain as a holy site.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu became the contemporary head of the Bai family.</p><p>The Bai family jumped to become a cultivating family.</p><p>However, the Qin family was still the Da Sui imperial family, enjoying glory and wealth, but unfortunately, no descendants with cultivation talent had appeared. Once there were descendants with spiritual roots, they would immediately be brought into the Azure Goat Temple to cultivate.</p>
