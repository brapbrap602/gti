<h1>Chapter 1123: No Rebirth</h1><p>“From the moment I gained sentience, I was alone, trapped in Xuanpu Palace, enduring boundless loneliness.  Living amongst the bamboo forests of Qianshan, I interacted with some spirits, but it was always casual, from a position of superiority.</p><p>“I had no understanding of ‘love’.</p><p>“Even after obtaining a human body and being reborn, I always considered myself a naturally born spirit. I discarded that mortal consciousness as worthless, not knowing how to deal with that past relationship, hoping time would erase it.</p><p>“At Yinshan Pass, thanks to your introduction, my younger brother, I witnessed the fraternal bond between the Tan brothers.</p><p>“One willingly risked his life, cultivating demonic arts to shield his elder brother from harm. The other, despite his low cultivation, tirelessly maintained the faint spark of his brother’s life for decades.</p><p>“At that moment, I finally understood—what love is, what it means to be human.</p><p>“When our souls merged, I had to bear his karma, his emotions!</p><p>“He always had attachments, caring deeply for Qingyang Temple and his disciples like family; it had become a deep-seated obsession, buried in his heart, which I had never detected.</p><p>“Soul injuries can be healed with medicine.</p><p>“Without understanding this, I could never break free from my shackles.</p><p>“You brought Yu Fu to me; I accepted him as a disciple, wholeheartedly assisting his cultivation, and tasked him with revitalizing Qingyang Temple once he became strong enough, finally resolving that obsession.</p><p>“In the demon fire, we truly became one.”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s expression shifted as he spoke.</p><p>From initial indifference and arrogance, to later confusion, and finally, a deep paternal affection when mentioning Qingyang Temple and Yu Fu.</p><p>As Yun Youzi himself said,</p><p>He understood ‘love’, becoming a true human!</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang finally understand.</p><p>Why Yun Youzi, after achieving high cultivation in the Taiyi Danzong, remained away from Da Sui for many years, never visiting Qingyang Temple on Cuiming Mountain, never seeing Jixin Daoist.</p><p>At the time, Qin Sang thought Yun Youzi had wholeheartedly pursued the Dao, severing his worldly ties.</p><p>Yet later, he treated the distant descendant Li Yu Fu as his own son, wholeheartedly dedicated to reviving Qingyang Temple, showing unusual importance to its lineage.</p><p>There was this hidden truth.</p><p>While soul possession exists in the cultivation world, it can't be done arbitrarily.</p><p>Each cultivator can only perform soul possession once in their lifetime. Of course, perhaps more powerful arts exist in the cultivation world that can break this rule.</p><p>Furthermore, cultivators must not possess mortals, otherwise, the mortal would collapse from the strain.</p><p>Yun Youzi’s experience was clearly different from soul possession.</p><p>Perhaps, as Yun Youzi said, a unique being born from a heavenly tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but think of his own experience.</p><p>He still doesn't understand if he counts as soul possession. When he came into this world, he was also a mortal, yet he occupied Qin Sanwa's body.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was soul possession, Qin Sang wouldn't dare to try it again.</p><p>Furthermore, he and Yun Youzi are very different.</p><p>Yun Youzi was a merging of fragmented souls; Qin Sang had a complete soul.</p><p>He only obtained Qin Sanwa's memories and body.</p><p>When his cultivation was low and his Dao heart unsteady, Qin Sang’s visit to Wangjia Village caused momentary confusion due to the original owner’s memories, but he quickly regained clarity, all the influence erased.</p><p>He is certain he is Qin Sang.</p><p>His cultivation wasn't hindered.</p><p>Yun Youzi’s journey was far more difficult, searching for elixirs, enduring hardships to obtain the Nightfall Lily, only slightly easing his condition.  Later, he realized his heart’s obsession, threw himself into the demon fire, and only then solved his problem.</p><p>“Earlier, when I gave you the Soul-Nourishing Wood, you said your soul was intact and without problems. Why did you face a double tribulation during your Nascent Soul Tribulation?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked doubtfully.</p><p>“Indeed, it was a double tribulation!”</p><p>Yun Youzi sighed after carefully listening to Qin Sang's description of his tribulation.</p><p>“The Nascent Soul Tribulation and the Transformation Tribulation arrived simultaneously; the combined power far exceeded my expectations.</p><p>“Although I was reborn from the flames, I am ultimately a hybrid being, a fusion of human and spirit souls. Such an anomaly is unacceptable to Heaven; the tribulation would inevitably change.</p><p>“Before the tribulation, I had a premonition, a sudden insight. In recent years, I’ve traveled far and wide, resolving various karmas, preparing for the inevitable.</p><p>“The Dao is heartless!</p><p>“If I survive this tribulation, I will be recognized by Heaven, and the future will be smooth.</p><p>“If not, I will perish.</p><p>“Dust to dust, earth to earth.”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked, truly feeling how insignificant he was, even as a cultivator.</p><p>The Dao is heartless!</p><p>A mushroom doesn't know the difference between night and day, a cicada doesn't know the length of a year.</p><p>Cultivators chase immortality and enlightenment, like moths to a flame, yet they continue to strive.</p><p>“The karmic ties between Yu Fu and Taiyi Danzong have been resolved. After my death, let Yu Fu follow you.  I have made arrangements for the minor spirits in the Qianshan bamboo forests who share a connection with me.”</p><p>The immortal world is in turmoil.  After you achieve the Nascent Soul stage, my dear brother, I hope you will visit Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea. You’ve inquired about the Qieji Yao Wang several times; you must have something in mind. Unfortunately, I cannot accompany you. The Qieji Yao Wang achieved enlightenment relatively late, and I don't know much about him. However, as the master of Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, it shouldn't be difficult for you to investigate…”</p><p>Yun Youzi softly delivered his final instructions.</p><p>His form grew increasingly ethereal, his voice faint, about to vanish from the world.</p><p>Qin Sang, suppressing his grief, listened to Yun Youzi’s words and solemnly pledged, “Senior, rest assured. I will help restore the Qingyang Temple to its former glory and protect Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea!”</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded with a smile, then said earnestly, “Finally, there’s one more thing, and only you, my dear brother, can do it.”</p><p>“Please, Senior!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned serious.</p><p>“My tribulation failed. Logically, I should disperse my consciousness, choose to dissolve my body and return to the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>“But that is not my wish. I do not seek a future life, only this one!</p><p>“The Dao has fifty aspects, yet Heaven follows forty-nine.</p><p>“I would rather remain in this life, to contend once more with Heaven!”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s gaze was bright, his voice resonant.</p><p>His ethereal body held the bearing of a giant!</p><p>He looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>“That piece of charred wood is what remains of my original spirit bamboo. Under the heavenly tribulation, my body turned to charcoal. This remaining piece was also damaged by the tribulation thunder, becoming charred wood.</p><p>“However, it is still derived from my original body. I used a secret technique to imbue it with a sliver of my primordial spirit.</p><p>“If you refine it into a top-grade magical artifact, it should protect my primordial spirit, and the artifact may have a chance of developing sentience, perhaps even eventually creating a spirit!</p><p>“I hope that one day you will achieve immortality. Then, I may be reborn through the artifact spirit!”</p><p>…</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade slip shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang’s consciousness withdrew from the jade slip, speechless.</p><p>He looked down at the piece of charred wood in his hand, heavy as a mountain!</p><p>Yun Youzi remained the same in his memory: the white-bearded Daoist, wholeheartedly devoted to the Dao.</p><p>Faced with a devastating tribulation, he held no resentment, only an unwavering pursuit of the Dao.</p><p>In despair, he fought for a sliver of hope.</p>
