<h1>Chapter 362: Insights on Magical Treasures</h1><p>It turned out they were aunt and nephew. Qin Sang had assumed Song Yi was Song Chengxian's son.</p><p>“How are they doing now?”</p><p>Song Yi replied, “My grandmother is being cared for by my mother and several elders. She is still in good health. My uncle, however, passed away many years ago.”</p><p>Song Chengxian had died? The last time Qin Sang saw him, he was just a newborn. Now, he heard that Song Chengxian had been gone for years.  Shopkeeper Wu was also quite elderly now. Having experienced the trials of his journey to the Great Sui Dynasty, Qin Sang merely sighed. It was difficult for him to be deeply moved by such news anymore.</p><p>“My uncle was ambushed in the Cloudmist Great Marsh and suffered severe injuries. He returned home, but his condition worsened soon after. I was still young then.  My uncle, with his remaining strength, guided me onto the path of cultivation, and then…” Song Yi's voice choked with emotion.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly. Song Chengxian's talent wasn't exceptional. Although Qin Sang had left him a Foundation Establishment Pill and some cultivation resources, the path of solitary cultivation must have been incredibly arduous for him. The path of immortality was cruel, and Song Chengxian was not its only victim.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang asked, “Who was the culprit? Was he found?”</p><p>Song Yi wiped away his tears and replied, “My uncle killed the attacker on the spot. The man was also a rogue cultivator, with no one to seek revenge.  I wasn't affected.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and dismissed Song Yi. He then turned to Shopkeeper Wu and asked, “What are your thoughts?”</p><p>By now, he could roughly guess Shopkeeper Wu's reason for summoning him.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu stood up, retrieved a jade slip, and offered it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, glanced at the jade slip, but didn't reach for it.  He fixed his gaze on Shopkeeper Wu's eyes, a hint of displeasure on his face. “Fellow Daoist Wu, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu didn't withdraw the jade slip.</p><p>“The first time Song Yi came here, I recognized him as a member of the Song family. He bears a striking resemblance to the other two Song children.</p><p>“This boy is intelligent and quick-witted, with a good nature.  He possesses triple spiritual roots. Although his talent isn't top-tier, it's still true spiritual roots, offering him the hope of Foundation Establishment.  Otherwise, I wouldn't dare to trouble Fellow Daoist Qin.</p><p>“I have no children of my own. This boy and I have a certain affinity. All I can do is pass on my lifelong learnings to him and do my utmost to give him a boost.  It’s the least I can do as his master.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, this jade slip has been passed down in my family for generations.  It contains the accumulated tool refining insights of several ancestors. It might not be much to your discerning eye.</p><p>“However, within this jade slip are the insights of an unknown senior, a former disciple of a Golden Core elder from the Hollow Spirit Sect. He served as a Dao child beside the Golden Core elder, observing the entire process of magical treasure refinement.</p><p>“Later, this senior recorded everything he witnessed.</p><p>“My ancestor came across this jade slip by chance and began to study the art of tool refining.</p><p>“I see that Fellow Daoist Qin has an interest in tool refining. I wonder if the contents of this jade slip might be of some assistance to you?”</p><p>Under Shopkeeper Wu's expectant gaze, Qin Sang considered for a moment, then accepted the jade slip and probed its contents with his divine sense.</p><p>The first things that caught his eye were the tool refining insights left by Shopkeeper Wu's ancestors.  Most of them had low cultivation levels, having dedicated their lives to tool refining at the expense of their own cultivation progress.</p><p>Qin Sang skimmed through these records before finally reaching the notes left by the unknown senior.</p><p>After carefully reviewing the contents, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Although the contents of the jade slip weren't written by the Golden Core elder himself, they provided a very detailed description of the magical treasure refinement process.  Even more valuable were the instructions given by the elder to his disciple during the refinement, all meticulously recorded.</p><p>They were from the Hollow Spirit Sect, which held unique insights into tool refining compared to other sects.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed the refinement method for the Primordial Concentric Rings in his mustard seed bag.  However, he had to rely on his own comprehension for the finer details.  Careful study of this jade slip would undoubtedly be of great benefit to him in the future.</p><p>Once he reached the Golden Core stage, he would likely receive secret transmissions bestowed by Mount Shaohua, but that was a matter for the future.</p><p>What truly excited Qin Sang was that these contents seemed to be helpful for the Ebony Sword as well, especially the words spoken by the Golden Core elder.</p><p>He could only understand a small portion of it at present, but he already gained some insights.  If he could fully comprehend it, the Ebony Sword's efficiency in devouring spiritual wood would certainly increase significantly.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang opened his eyes and made up his mind.</p><p>He still had an unused recommendation slot for disciples to enter the sect.</p><p>With Song Yi's triple spiritual roots and his recommendation, Song Yi's acceptance into Mount Shaohua was practically guaranteed.</p><p>Moreover, Song Yi was a member of the Song family.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu had likely learned of his connection to the Song family and approached him with a hopeful mindset.</p><p>“After joining Mount Shaohua, Song Yi will be a disciple of the sect.  If a senior takes a liking to him and accepts him as a personal disciple, he will have to choose a new master accordingly,” Qin Sang reminded Shopkeeper Wu.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu replied calmly, “As long as he's well taken care of.”</p><p>Since Shopkeeper Wu had already thought things through, Qin Sang didn't say anything more. He called Song Yi back in, took out a jade pendant, and handed it to him. “The next time Mount Shaohua opens its doors to new disciples, take this token with you.  When the welcoming disciples from Dao Gate Peak inquire, answer truthfully.”</p><p>Song Yi hesitated to accept it, looking at Shopkeeper Wu. “Master…”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu urged him, “Quickly thank Senior Qin!”</p><p>Only then did Song Yi accept the jade pendant and bow deeply to Qin Sang.</p><p>“No need for formalities.” Qin Sang smiled and helped Song Yi up. “Your master and I are on equal footing.  You should address me as Uncle-Master Qin from now on. The rules of Mount Shaohua are not strict, but after joining the sect, there are certain chores that must be performed.  The steward of Dao Gate Peak is a good acquaintance of mine. He should be able to offer some assistance for my sake. But these are minor matters. Your cultivation depends on your own hard work. Once your cultivation reaches a certain level, returning to the Song family's ancestral home will not be difficult.”</p><p>Song Ying, upon leaving Moon Inquiry City, had voluntarily relinquished all of the Song family's assets there and signed the necessary documents.</p><p>When Qin Sang first achieved Foundation Establishment, his foundation was still shallow. Furthermore, Song Chengxian was still young and had not yet embarked on the path of cultivation. There was no suitable justification for him to interfere with the rules of Moon Inquiry City.</p><p>Now, he would leave this matter for Song Yi to resolve himself, as a form of motivation.</p><p>With Qin Sang's promise, both Shopkeeper Wu and his disciple were overjoyed.</p><p>Qin Sang chatted with Shopkeeper Wu for a while longer, leaving behind some spirit materials for him to refine into magical tools.  He was about to visit Granny Jing when he received unexpected news from Shopkeeper Wu.</p><p>“More than twenty years ago, Granny Jing closed her shop and left Moon Inquiry City. She hasn't been seen for a long time.  Without Granny Jing at the helm, the members of the Secret Shop gathered privately a few times, but gradually lost contact. However, Granny Jing's shop is still here. Fellow Daoist Qin can leave a message talisman, and she'll see it when she returns.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. “Does Fellow Daoist Wu know where Granny Jing went?”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu shook his head. “Granny Jing didn't leave any information before departing. I'm not aware of her whereabouts.”</p><p>Bidding farewell to Shopkeeper Wu, Qin Sang arrived at the Secret Shop.  As expected, the doors were tightly shut, with no sign of Granny Jing.</p><p>A protective barrier surrounded the shop.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang took out a message talisman, explained the situation, and sent it into the barrier before leaving the city.</p>
