<h1>Chapter 450: Peak Appears</h1><p>The dark waters of the chaotic islands were covered by countless streaks of escaping light, like a meteor shower converging towards Stargazing Island, a magnificent sight.  As Qin Sang expected, everyone had received orders; all cultivators in the chaotic islands were alerted. A flash of red light always signaled a major event.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, what's happening?" Mu Yifeng approached, walking alongside Qin Sang, gazing at the crowded Stargazing Island in the distance, his concern evident.  This was Mu Yifeng's first time witnessing such a scene.</p><p>Three years ago, Mu Yifeng had been severely injured but, fortunately, was able to return to the sect to recover.  He not only avoided the most dangerous period but also greatly benefited from that battle. After three years of diligent cultivation, he made astonishing progress, nearing the False Core stage.  Given his strength, he should have led a small team in the chaotic islands; however, due to his unfamiliarity with the situation, he was assigned to Qin Sang to learn battlefield experience. It was simply bad luck for Mu Yifeng; he had only gone on one mission since his return when this incident occurred.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't explain it either, only urging his team members to be alert.</p><p>…</p><p>By the time Qin Sang arrived, hundreds of cultivators had already gathered on Stargazing Island, forming arrays in the air, with more continuously arriving.  After scanning the area, he spotted his fellow disciples from Xiaohua Mountain and led his men towards them.  He knew most of them, either through nodding acquaintances or previous collaborations.</p><p>"Senior Brother Rong, Senior Brother Kong…"</p><p>Qin Sang greeted each one.</p><p>The others were polite to Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng as well.</p><p>The person in the center was Senior Brother Rong, who had taken over from Qi Yuanshou at Hanging Skull Pass. He was now a False Core cultivator, exceptionally skilled in five-element spells, and had distinguished himself on the battlefield since his arrival in the chaotic islands.  His reputation now surpassed even Qin Sang's.  Among Xiaohua Mountain's Foundation Establishment disciples in the chaotic islands, Senior Brother Rong was the strongest.  Before him, it was Teng Zhaogang, but unfortunately, he had fallen into a trap set by the Sky Walk League during the first year's war, nearly having his Golden Core shattered, leaving him critically injured.  Luckily, Qin Sang and his team found him in time, rescuing him and sending him back to the sect for treatment.  His condition was reportedly poor, his life saved, but likely unable to form a Golden Core.</p><p>There were many cultivators similar to Senior Brother Teng.  Their experiences repeatedly warned Qin Sang never to underestimate the dangers.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, Junior Brother Mu, you're finally here."</p><p>Senior Brother Rong was also polite to Qin Sang, greeting him before asking, "There was no prior warning.  How did this suddenly… I heard that Junior Brothers Qin and Mu just returned from a mission. Did you notice anything unusual from the Sky Walk League?"</p><p>Stargazing Island had summoned them, but nothing had happened.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, looking around. "Everything outside was normal.  Where's Junior Brother Zhan?"</p><p>Zhan Yi was the most favored disciple of Che Yutao, who represented Xiaohua Mountain on Stargazing Island.  If there were any secrets, Zhan Yi would know first.</p><p>Senior Brother Rong sighed, "Junior Brother Zhan is elusive. We're all waiting for him!"</p><p>Speak of the devil.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong were discussing, Zhan Yi finally deigned to appear.  Compared to three years ago, Zhan Yi's cultivation had deepened significantly. Many had lost magic tools, been injured, or even lost their lives during the war, but a few, including Qin Sang and Zhan Yi, had greatly benefited from the upheaval.</p><p>Surrounded and bombarded with questions, Zhan Yi, unable to endure it, waved his hand, creating a soundproof barrier.  He cautiously looked around before whispering, "Master and the others have already gone ahead… Master said… it seems that the Pointing Heaven Peak has appeared."</p><p>"Pointing Heaven Peak?"</p><p>Qin Sang was uncertain, glancing at Mu Yifeng, who nodded slightly.  They certainly wouldn't forget. Three years ago, Mu Yifeng had followed Senior Fang and others in search of the so-called Pointing Heaven Peak, only to be ambushed. That battle had become the trigger for the standoff between the two sides in these waters. However, no one had mentioned Pointing Heaven Peak since then.</p><p>Those present were not fools.  The commotion caused by the appearance of Pointing Heaven Peak, combined with Stargazing Island's orders over the years, immediately made them realize that Pointing Heaven Peak was certainly related to spatial fluctuations!</p><p>"Someone has found the location of the spatial fluctuation?"</p><p>"What exactly is Pointing Heaven Peak?"</p><p>"Why were we suddenly summoned? Has the Sky Walk League discovered it too? Are we going to fight again, this time to seize Pointing Heaven Peak?"</p><p>…</p><p>The others continued to question, but Zhan Yi didn't know much more, though they now had a general idea.</p><p>"I wonder which fellow cultivator found the spatial fluctuation and struck it rich!" a senior brother exclaimed enviously.</p><p>From the expressions on everyone's faces, it was clear they all agreed with their senior brother.</p><p>Guanxi Island had issued a decree, offering a substantial reward to anyone who discovered spatial fluctuations.  Guanxi Island represented the prestige of the major sects in Xiaohan Domain; they wouldn't handle this lightly.</p><p>Qin Sang reckoned that while a magical treasure as a reward for finding spatial fluctuations might be unrealistic, requesting a high-grade pill to aid in Golden Core advancement from Guanxi Island would certainly be feasible.</p><p>Xiaohan Domain and the Tianxing Alliance, combined, had thousands upon thousands of Foundation Establishment cultivators who had searched back and forth for three years, scouring the area—turning over nearly every inch of lakebed sediment.</p><p>Qin Sang, equally diligent in his search, had found nothing.</p><p>Unfortunately, someone else beat him to it…</p><p>Missed opportunities are missed opportunities.  One could only say the other person was incredibly lucky.</p><p>In the blink of an eye…</p><p>Cultivators are swift. Before Qin Sang and the others could exchange a few words, all the cultivators in the Landaoyu Waters had assembled.</p><p>Above Guanxi Island, the various colored escaping lights intertwined, like a vast, colorful sunset.  The dense mass of figures within were all Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>A sight like this was something most cultivators would never witness in their lifetime.</p><p>The battle formation was well-rehearsed and relatively compact.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain disciples were positioned on the left flank of the formation, surrounded by righteous cultivators, while the demonic cultivators were on the right, maintaining their non-interference stance.</p><p>As the formation solidified, a figure suddenly flew from Guanxi Island—it was Deputy Island Master Xiao.  The absence of other Golden Core masters led to murmurs among the crowd.</p><p>"Silence!"</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao, displeased, issued a sharp rebuke. His gaze swept across the formation.  "All listen! Upon encountering Tianxing Alliance scoundrels, show no mercy; kill them!"</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>With that, Deputy Island Master Xiao summoned his flying sword, the sword light encircling him as he turned and sped toward the outer mist.</p><p>Everyone silently followed.</p><p>For a time, the escaping lights, resembling a flowing sunset, moved towards the mist, passing through to the outer perimeter of the array. There, Deputy Island Master Xiao's sword flight continued, heading directly southeast.</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao seemed to be accommodating lower-cultivation disciples, his escape technique not particularly fast, allowing the formation to remain intact.</p><p>Not far from their departure, a chorus of exclamations erupted from within the formation.</p><p>On the horizon, between the water and the sky…</p><p>Dark clouds blotted out the moon, and lightning bolts danced.</p>
