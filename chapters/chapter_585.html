Chapter 578: The Followers


Qin Sang relentlessly commanded the Flying Night Fiend to press the attack, pummeling the Ferocious Tiger.
Yun Youzi, ignoring the battle, scanned their surroundings.
Before them lay a dry riverbed, filled with smooth river stones.  Across the river, a fractured mountain loomed, its collapsed debris partially blocking the river's course.
Beyond the mountain stretched endless darkness.
Yun Youzi warned Qin Sang not to let the Flying Night Fiend stray beyond the riverbed. Even if the tiger fled across, they were not to pursue.
Qin Sang obediently complied.
A short while later, Yun Youzi's eyes suddenly lit up. He fixed his gaze on a mottled green river stone, raised a hand, formed a hand seal, and struck.
At this moment, the tiger's roars intensified, its movements frantic and erratic, clearly targeting Yun Youzi.
Qin Sang knew Yun Youzi must have found something crucial.  Staring at the stone, after a moment, he too noticed something peculiar.
‘Boom!’
The hand seal struck the green stone, erupting in a flash of green light.
The tiger, locked in combat with the Flying Night Fiend, suddenly froze, whimpered, and vanished without a trace.  The world around them shattered once more.
More accurately, only the world on their side of the riverbed shattered.
A subtle pressure they had been feeling also disappeared.
Seizing the opportunity, Yun Youzi leaped across the riverbed. Looking back, the original riverbank remained.
“This is the real Ancient Medicine Garden, but its ancient restrictions are now chaotic and ubiquitous.  We'll encounter a new restriction, sealing off a section of space, every few steps. We can only see two restricted spaces ahead at a time. We must follow the correct path and break through them one by one.”
Yun Youzi explained, “Without the Flying Night Fiend, we would have to start from the edge, dodging the tiger while weakening it by breaking the restrictions, slowly searching for their core. Now, we can directly target the core and break it, saving us a great deal of time and effort.”
The Flying Night Fiend, being a living corpse, was more agile than ordinary refined corpses.
Qin Sang didn't need to expend much effort controlling it.
He wanted to assist Yun Youzi but found the restrictions too complex. His understanding of restriction formations was insufficient to be of much help.
However, Qin Sang didn't give up. Following Yun Youzi, he observed and pondered, integrating his accumulated knowledge, and rapidly improving his skills.
‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’
They stopped halfway up the mountain.
The mountain had collapsed from this point.  Looking past the broken terrain, they saw the next restricted space.
On the other side of the mountain, a sheer cliff face dropped precipitously to the left, with a few withered vines clinging to it, looking as though they might snap at any moment. Below, all was darkness.
To the right lay a mountain ridge.
It was clear that these two paths were blocked by different restrictions, requiring a choice.
The path ahead would undoubtedly fork many more times.  Without knowing the correct route, wandering aimlessly would lead them nowhere, and the garden might close before they found the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.
Qin Sang and Yun Youzi reached the cliff's edge.
The Flying Night Fiend unleashed a powerful punch. The force of the blow created ripples in the air, revealing a faint, shimmering barrier.
The punch tore a hole in the barrier.
Before it could close, they jumped through, plummeting towards the depths below.
This restriction was easily broken.  Not only was there no tiger, but they didn't even need to find its core. Brute force was enough.
This indicated the restriction was extremely weak, likely to dissipate within a few centuries, merging the surrounding spaces.
Such cases were not uncommon.  The restrictions within the Ancient Medicine Garden varied in strength and size.
Some were so powerful, even Nascent Soul cultivators were helpless against them.
Fortunately, the path to the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, aside from a few difficult sections, posed challenges within the Flying Night Fiend's capabilities. Otherwise, Core Formation demon cultivators wouldn't have been able to harvest the fruit.
Those few difficult sections were meant as trials and tribulations.
The instant they entered the chasm, a powerful suction force pulled them downwards.
Then, a gust of icy wind from above intensified their descent.
The shadows below seemed like a gaping maw, waiting to swallow its prey.
Qin Sang and Yun Youzi exchanged a glance, then simultaneously channeled their spiritual energy to resist the wind and suction.
Suddenly, countless bony claws erupted from the darkness below, forming a skeletal forest, reaching and grasping as if countless skeletons were scrambling upwards.
Combined with the ghostly wails of the wind, the scene was chilling.
Without needing Yun Youzi's urging, Qin Sang broke free from the suction, flying upwards, while commanding the Flying Night Fiend to descend.  Just as it neared the claws, it unleashed a burst of corpse energy.
The energy swept outwards like a wave.  A cacophony of cracking sounds followed as the bony claws shattered.
Countless bone fragments flew everywhere, obscuring their vision.
But the claws were endless.  As soon as one batch was destroyed, another emerged, continuing their relentless ascent.
The Flying Night Fiend couldn't keep up, and the space above was shrinking.
Then, Yun Youzi acted.
He opened his palm, and the Flawless Pearl spun slightly.  A beam of white light shot downwards, transforming into a flying sword.  It weaved between the claws, piercing the depths of the bone forest.
An inhuman scream echoed.
The suction and icy wind vanished instantly.
Simultaneously, the bony claws disappeared, as if it had all been a dream.
Finally, they saw the bottom of the chasm.
Nestled against the cliff face was a semi-circular, frigid pool, surprisingly filled with water. The pool was deep, emanating a chilling mist.
They could have seen it before, but the bone claws had obscured their view. Now, with the restriction broken, they knew this was the next level.
“This pool is bottomless. A Nascent Soul cultivator once explored it, retrieving a Heaven's Chill Grass,” Yun Youzi said softly, landing beside the pool.
Heaven's Chill Grass was far more valuable than the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, even beneficial to Nascent Soul cultivators' cultivation.
Qin Sang couldn't help but envy that cultivator's luck.
The restrictions near the pool were also weak. Yun Youzi quickly located the core, instructing the Flying Night Fiend to break it.
However, just as the Flying Night Fiend was about to strike, Yun Youzi's expression changed. He abruptly stopped Qin Sang, looked up at the cliff above, and said gravely, “Someone is following us! They took the same path!”
Qin Sang was startled.
“So soon?”
Those following them were most likely demon cultivators from the Heavenly Demon Ridge.
He never expected to encounter them so soon, after only a few steps into the garden.
