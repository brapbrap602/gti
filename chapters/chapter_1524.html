<h1>Chapter 1515: The Buddha Bone Relic (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1515: The Buddha Bone Relic (4k)</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words,</p><p>Tong Lingyu was silent for a moment, then said solemnly, "The Tianshan branch is powerful and has always been restless.  There have long been arguments that they shouldn't solely enjoy the resources and power of a main branch.  The Xuan Tian Palace has experienced several internal conflicts, all fueled by them. They profited greatly from the decline of the other eight branches, allowing them to flourish."</p><p>It seems Tong Lingyu intends to target the Tianshan branch.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, nodding and asking, "What does Daoist Friend plan to do?"</p><p>"The Tianshan branch has many factions, but these are internal and they always present a united front externally. Shang Lu's plot, others may not have been unaware of, even if they didn't secretly assist, they tacitly approved. The Tianshan branch is ambitious and unwieldy.  With Master Luo and I currently weak, if we leave them unchecked, they will become a cancer to the sect.  The mastermind is obvious, but others are also implicated.  While capital punishment may be avoided, lesser punishments are unavoidable. After clarifying their roles and contributions, we will deal with them accordingly…"</p><p>Tong Lingyu clearly had a plan already formulated and well-considered.</p><p>If not for the suppression of Hun Mo and Tian Peng and other demons by the Exquisite Treasure Pagoda, this would be Xuan Tian Palace's most difficult time.</p><p>Facing internal and external troubles, even if Tong Lingyu had such thoughts, she could only keep them to herself. She would strive to unite the various branches of the sect to resist external threats, making it difficult to make the decisive move of cutting off the rot.</p><p>Should internal conflict erupt, the demons would surely seize the opportunity.</p><p>Now, the top experts among the demons have been wiped out.</p><p>The demons are preoccupied with their own problems.</p><p>Jiutou Da Sheng is the only late-stage expert in the North Sea, but the other demon kings suffered heavy casualties, and they also worry about a human alliance exploiting their weakness.  They wouldn't dare provoke Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>The demonic forces in the Boundless Sea are no better off; the situation is now clear and peaceful.</p><p>There are no immediate threats outside Xuan Tian Palace.  This is a perfect opportunity to use Yin Changsheng's demonic transformation as a pretext to cleanse the sect and excise the festering wounds.</p><p>However, Tong Lingyu's influence is less than Yin Changsheng's, and she has lost her spiritual treasure, so she may struggle to completely subdue all parties and will be hampered in her actions.</p><p>Tong Lingyu knew that Qin Sang is a powerful ally.  By uniting with him, all problems would be solved.  This person's nature is not demonic, but she is wary of him.</p><p>She treated Luo Yun with all her might, both because of their years of friendship and because she could use Luo Yun as a counterweight against Qin Sang later on.</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't know Qin Sang well and didn't dare to claim to understand his nature; caution is always necessary.</p><p>Having just been saved by Qin Sang, she can't just betray him; besides, she really doesn't want to be enemies with him.</p><p>Offering him the position of Grand Elder was a test.</p><p>Qin Sang's resolute refusal, while it's impossible to know whether it was his true intention or a pretense, gave Tong Lingyu some reassurance.</p><p>Now, the two tacitly agreed to divide the Tianshan branch and demote it to a lesser branch!</p><p>Qin Sang is satisfied.  Dividing the Tianshan branch will surely bring him great rewards.</p><p>"What about the Xuan Tian branch?" Qin Sang asked again.</p><p>"The Xuan Tian branch is mainly the Yin and Luo families.  Years of intermarriage have made the two families inseparable. Yin Changsheng's power is unmatched; he has controlled the Xuan Tian branch for many years, and no one has dared to defy him."</p><p>Saying this, Tong Lingyu glanced at Qin Sang; both Yin Changsheng and the Yin Lord fell at Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>"I will approach the Luo family first, presenting Master Luo to them and explaining the situation. If there are any who stubbornly refuse to cooperate, I will need Qin Daoist Friend's help. Considering Yin Changsheng's merits and demerits, his descendants will be demoted from the main branch, and we will observe their actions…"</p><p>Tong Lingyu plans to weaken the Xuan Tian branch, but she also wants to preserve its status as a main branch.</p><p>In the future, Xuan Tian Palace will be a three-legged stool, preventing her from having direct conflicts with Qin Sang before she breaks through to the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely participates in power struggles, but that doesn't mean he's obtuse; he understands Tong Lingyu's intentions perfectly.</p><p>He seeks the Dao and has no ambition to control Xuan Tian Palace; he doesn't care about Tong Lingyu's attitude.</p><p>As long as he gets what he wants.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the table lightly and said, "I am not talented, Qin. Decades ago, I established a sect called Qingyang Temple. It's a small sect, nothing compared to Xuan Tian Palace."</p><p>Qin Sang explained about Qingyang Temple and his origins.</p><p>Learning that Qin Sang is from the Beichen region, Tong Lingyu is not surprised. Otherwise, why would such a figure be unknown in the North Sea?</p><p>Tong Lingyu frowned, "Daoist Friend means…"</p><p>"I wish to find a place in the Boundless Sea and also leave a legacy in the North Sea; I would appreciate it if Daoist Friend and Xuan Tian Palace would offer their protection."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Compared to the North Sea, the Beichen region is too crowded.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace, the Zuishen Palace, and other ancient secret realms no longer exist, and the Beichen region has lost its greatest advantage.</p><p>Many demonic leaders have been suppressed, leaving the Northern Sea's demonic path exceptionally weak.  The vast ocean is empty, presenting a prime opportunity for expansion.  He could personally seize a superior island for his sect with minimal effort.</p><p>Qin Sang plans to borrow the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle from Liuli to relocate some disciples.  The Northern Star region is an ancestral land and cannot be completely abandoned.</p><p>When he has time, Qin Sang intends to spend some time searching for the path through the storm belt, to prevent the isolation of the two Qingyang Observatories. He possesses a Moon-Watching Rhinoceros Horn, so getting lost is unlikely, and the danger is minimal.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's purpose in mentioning this to Tong Lingyu is not merely to foster better relations between Qingyang Observatory and Xuantian Palace.  Xuantian Palace's sacred grounds live up to their name, containing many treasured locations where low-level cultivators can gain significant benefits.  By sending some Qingyang Observatory disciples there, Qingyang Observatory could produce a continuous stream of experts, ensuring its prosperity!</p><p>With only one Yuan Ying cultivator in Qingyang Observatory, Qin Sang isn't greedy.  He doesn't covet treasures and opportunities beyond the Yuan Ying stage, only requesting a few places similar to the Ice Wind Cave.</p><p>The Tian Shan lineage no longer exists, so many places must be available.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's expression became serious, seeming to carefully consider the matter, though secretly relieved that Qin Sang wasn't asking for Qingyang Observatory to replace Tian Shan as the main branch. Everything would be fine under such circumstances.</p><p>She senses Qin Sang's self-restraint and is growing convinced of his sincere dedication to cultivation, believing his intentions are genuine. With the sacred grounds' location already compromised, sharing some benefits with Qingyang Observatory and befriending Qin Sang is something Tong Lingyu is happy to do.</p><p>"There's no precedent for this, but I will do my best!" Tong Lingyu solemnly promised.</p><p>"I will also do my utmost to assist, Daoist friend," Qin Sang smiled and nodded.</p><p>His actions seem somewhat hasty, as he has proactively given up a lot. Given more time, after absorbing the gains from the sacred grounds and experiencing a surge in power, he could simply cultivate influence within Xuantian Palace to secure more benefits for Listening Snow Tower and Qingyang Observatory—benefits Tong Lingyu couldn't refuse.</p><p>But Qin Sang lacks time. He has decided to depart for Central Plains as soon as possible, if at all feasible—the sooner, the better!</p><p>After leaving the sacred grounds, Qin Sang has time to carefully review the remaining contents of the jade slips. These contain many of Xiao Xiangzi's observations from the Central Plains, fueling Qin Sang's longing.  According to Xiao Xiangzi, the Central Plains gathers abundant spiritual energy and is the true heart of this world!</p><p>Times change, and most of Xiao Xiangzi's records are now considered anecdotes.  Unexpectedly, Qin Sang encountered a final entry that left him deeply moved.</p><p>During his travels, Xiao Xiangzi accidentally discovered a Buddhist relic—a bone fragment of a great Buddhist monk.  The monk's descendants thought it was an ordinary relic, but Xiao Xiangzi recognized the hidden potential, possibly capable of assisting Yuan Ying cultivators to breakthrough!</p><p>The relic was useless to Xiao Xiangzi, so he didn't take it, simply recording it as a curious observation.  If no one else has discovered its secret, the relic might still be there!</p><p>This is the first opportunity Qin Sang has encountered to break through to the late Yuan Ying stage, making the journey worthwhile.</p><p>The problem lies in the difficulty of traveling from the Northern Sea to the Central Plains. The journey is arduous; the safe havens aren't linearly connected, making the route far longer than the straight-line distance. Even with a nautical chart, there are many dangers along the way, and the journey will require considerable time, only feasible with the abilities of a late-stage Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>If he could break through to the late Yuan Ying stage himself, would he still need to struggle to find the bone relic?</p><p>There's another method: external assistance.  Cultivators are adept at using magical artifacts.  Qin Sang immediately thought of Liuli's Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle.</p><p>Qin Sang recognizes the shuttle’s extraordinary origins and wonders where Bing Yao obtained it. Even if he wanted to replicate it, it would require immense effort and time, and it would be impossible to match all of its abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang plans to borrow the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle first, confirming whether it can help him traverse the storm belt and reach the Central Plains, before discussing it with Liuli.  As it was a gift from her master, Liuli might be reluctant to part with it.</p><p>However, persuading her to journey to the Central Plains together would be ideal; in a foreign land, they could support each other.</p><p>With the passage of time, who knows where the bone relic is now?  The sooner he departs, the better, allowing him to cultivate and search simultaneously.</p><p>He won't likely remain in the Northern Sea for long, unable to constantly oversee Qingyang Observatory.</p><p>Before his departure, leaving a legacy for Qingyang Observatory is all he can do.  Therefore, Qin Sang acted subtly, securing benefits without causing resentment from Xuantian Palace towards Qingyang Observatory.</p><p>Journey to Zhongzhou: An Uncertain Path</p><p>The journey to Zhongzhou is uncertain; I don't know when I'll return. I've paved the way for Qingyang Temple; how far it goes depends on the abilities and good fortune of future generations.</p><p>Tong Lingyu sensed Qin Sang's goodwill, relaxed, and discussed the details with him.</p><p>After careful planning, Tong Lingyu left, leaving the cave abode to Qin Sang so he could recuperate.</p><p>When we return to Xuantian Palace at full strength, a confrontation is inevitable.</p><p>After seeing Tong Lingyu off, Qin Sang sealed the cave abode.  He sat quietly for a while before reviewing his gains.</p><p>This trip into the subterranean realm, orchestrated by Yin Changsheng, was the greatest crisis he'd faced since forming his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Fortunately, he won, and his gains far exceeded expectations!</p><p>The four-part Serpent Seal has been given to Liuli. Once she comprehends the Tongbao Scripture, she will possess a true spiritual treasure!</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang glanced at his external manifestation sitting beside him. Unexpectedly, his manifestation possesses a spiritual treasure before his main body.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang closed his eyes, his mind sinking into his dantian, where he saw the Di Sha Sword.</p><p>After merging the two fragments, the Di Sha Sword remained unchanged, and its spirit remained unresponsive.</p><p>Qin Sang extended a strand of his spiritual sense to touch the Di Sha Sword, but after numerous attempts, he gave up.</p><p>He sighed inwardly. Now that he has collected all four fragments of the Di Sha Sword, the spirit's recovery should be faster than before, but he doesn't know when it will awaken.</p><p>This cultivation method is clearly closely related to the Di Sha Sword.  Surely the sword spirit knows the method?</p><p>Thinking of Bai, who suffers from amnesia, Qin Sang became uncertain.</p><p>He cannot rely on a single person—a lesson Qin Sang has learned.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi probably doesn't know about the cultivation method; otherwise, why didn't he mention it?</p><p>The cultivation method Qin Sang saw in the depths of Youming Valley was inscribed with sword energy.</p><p>The sword energy formed a terrifying, enduring storm that enveloped the method. Qingzhu had to help clear a path before it could be seen.</p><p>The other parts of the method are likely near the remaining fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang suspects Xiao Xiangzi may not have been the first to encounter the fragments.</p><p>My trip to Zhongzhou involves several tasks:</p><p>1.  Obtain the Buddha Bone Relic.</p><p>2.  Gather information on the Tian Tong and Tian Xiang Halls. If the sword energy storm persists, I can obtain the cultivation method from its original location.</p><p>3.  Investigate those who removed the Di Sha Sword fragments, starting with Xiao Xiangzi's experiences.</p><p>4.  Search Zhongzhou for a map to Canglang Sea.</p><p>5.  Find the Ghost Mother.</p><p>Zhongzhou is vast, and each task is challenging, like searching for a needle in a haystack—not something that can be accomplished overnight.</p><p>Based on my experience, ancient scriptures are not always accessible. Missing an opportunity might mean waiting hundreds of years—the reason I'm eager to depart.</p><p>There are also concerns:</p><p>The Qisha Hall and Ziwei Palace are interconnected, opening and closing simultaneously.</p><p>What impact will Ziwei Palace's ascension have on Qisha Hall?</p><p>What about Tian Tong and Tian Xiang Halls?</p><p>Are there similar halls in this world?</p><p>Could they… also have ascended?</p><p>There are too many things that need to be confirmed.</p><p>I'm alone. After settling things at Qingyang Temple, there's nothing left to hold me in Beihai; cultivation is the same anywhere.</p><p>Dismissing these thoughts, Qin Sang silently cultivated, focusing on the effects of the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>My current cultivation speed surpasses that of someone with dual spiritual roots—not bad.</p><p>The moment he started cultivating, the surrounding spiritual energy surged, rapidly absorbed and refined by Qin Sang. His cultivation speed had significantly increased.</p><p>Qin Sang circulated his cultivation method for eighty-one cycles.  He was startled, waking from meditation with a look of joy.</p><p>"Even a Heaven-grade spiritual root wouldn't be this fast!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, amazed.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool's effects were extraordinary; Qin Sang had undergone a transformation.</p><p>Besides the increased cultivation speed, I wonder if there are other benefits?</p><p>I haven't noticed any other changes yet; I'll find out later.</p><p>Thinking about the difference between a five-element spiritual root and a Heaven-grade spiritual root makes me feel disheartened—a clear case of others having it better.</p><p>Stopping his cultivation, Qin Sang remembered another gain: two Spirit-Subduing Incenses.</p><p>While useless for my cultivation, they are coveted by other cultivators; even Grand Cultivators would be interested. They're excellent bargaining chips.</p><p>I'll see if Xuantian Palace has anything worth trading for them; otherwise, I'll take them to Zhongzhou.</p><p>Zhongzhou cultivators are likely no different, and they might prove very useful.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang took out a jade box he'd crafted for storing treasures and carefully put them away.</p><p>In addition, Xiao Xiangzi left the method for refining Spirit-Subduing Incense on a jade slip.</p><p>Spirit-Subduing Incense differs from ordinary pills; it's not difficult to refine, even for those who aren't master alchemists.  However, the quantity and quality of the spiritual herbs required are astounding; ordinary people couldn't possibly gather them.</p><p>Right now, I only have the Wanling Fruit.</p><p>I'll collect the necessary herbs for Spirit-Subduing Incense in the future, but I'm not confident I can gather them all.</p>
