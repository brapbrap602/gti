<h1>Chapter 612: The Severed Arm and Corpse</h1><p>Chapter 612: The Severed Arm and Corpse</p><p>Western Frontier, a wild land.</p><p>Dangerous mountains and treacherous waters, cliffs and precipices are everywhere, poisonous miasma frequently occurs, and ferocious beasts and venomous insects coexist. Even the occasional winding mountain path is fraught with peril.  However, while the Western Frontier is perilous, its scenery is exceptionally unique—peculiar peaks and strange rocks, cascading waterfalls, and layers of mountains, a vast and varied landscape.</p><p>This place is not uninhabited.  On the contrary, many ordinary people live in the Western Frontier; they are indigenous people whose ancestors have lived here for generations.  They mostly live in villages, are skilled in martial arts and insect control, and eke out a living in the harsh environment.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>A small river flows between the cliffs, its surface not wide but extremely swift.  The water splashing against the rocks on the riverbank creates a spray of white water.  The course of this small river, like most rivers in the Western Frontier, is unusually tortuous. Obstructed by rocks and cliffs, one can occasionally see where the water is blocked, forming small whirlpools that trap large clumps of dead branches, weeds, and leaves, accumulating over time. In some places, even a thick log lies across the river, scarred and clearly broken and fallen from a mountain tree.</p><p>However, there's no need to worry about their decay in the river. The Western Frontier has abundant rainfall; a heavy downpour occurs every few days, washing the mountains clean.  After the rain, the river swells, carrying away all the debris.</p><p>As the saying goes, the cicadas' chirping makes the forest seem quieter, the birds' singing makes the mountains seem more secluded.  The river's rushing sound and the cacophony of birds and beasts from the surrounding mountains create a strangely peaceful atmosphere.  Especially now, in the early morning, after a light rain, with fine drizzle still falling, the moisture condenses into a thin mist shrouding the mountain peaks, resembling a fairyland.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp whistling sound came from downstream. The mist swayed, and a golden light was seen in the distance, moving swiftly upstream through the fog.</p><p>The golden light stopped abruptly in mid-air, revealing a middle-aged man in strange robes. The man was tall and strong, standing suspended in the air, with a point of golden light dancing around him, vaguely resembling a sword.  His features were rough, his face marked with intricate patterns and three claw marks of unknown origin extending from one corner of his eye to the other corner of his mouth. The claw marks were a deathly gray, seemingly carrying residual poison, accentuating his ferocious appearance. His robe was uniquely fashioned, appearing to be made from irregular pieces of animal hide sewn together in a bizarre pattern, with vibrant colors.  His neck, wrists, and even his face were adorned with strange patterns made with unknown pigments, along with numerous bone ornaments, animal teeth, and strange insects.</p><p>If any villagers from a nearby settlement passed by and saw his attire, they would immediately prostrate themselves, calling him a shaman, high priest, or messenger of the spirit, among other such titles.  The animal hides, teeth, and bones he wore were all from the most ferocious venomous insects and beasts, creatures feared by the people of the Western Frontier. Only the legendary spirit messengers, or the shamans and priests of large villages, had the ability to hunt them.</p><p>From the perspective of a cultivator from Xiaohan Domain, however, this man was a fellow cultivator. His attire was extremely unusual in Xiaohan Domain, and his cultivation level wasn't particularly high, only at the tenth level of Qi Condensation.</p><p>The man in animal hides stood in the air, his gaze as sharp as a hawk's, fixed on the river below.  The river made a sharp bend directly beneath him, with a thick layer of broken branches and leaves piled up on the surface. Among the debris, a white arm protruded.</p><p>The Western Frontier people are martial, and disputes between villages over resources are common, making the appearance of corpses in the river nothing unusual.  Initially, the man in animal hides paid little attention. However, a cursory glance revealed some unusual details that caught his attention.</p><p>The man in animal hides instantly landed on the riverbank, extended his hand toward the center of the river, and sent out a stream of spiritual energy, effortlessly pulling the corpse from the river.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>As the corpse was pulled out, the whirlpool broke up, scattering the accumulated debris.  Some was carried away by the current, but more flowed down from upstream, including several logs as thick as a man's thigh.</p><p>*THWACK!*</p><p>A corpse, face up, washed ashore.  A young man, barely out of his twenties, with a surprisingly delicate face. His skin was pale, clearly having been in the water for a long time.  His eyes were closed, his breath gone. His left arm was severed at the shoulder; whether the blood had drained away or been stanched, it was impossible to tell.  A corpse with a missing arm.</p><p>"A Witch God's emissary, as expected!"</p><p>The man in the animal-skin tunic's face lit up with greed. Unexpected windfall on his journey.</p><p>"This robe should be quite good! What a shame!"</p><p>He examined the tattered robe on the corpse, recognizing the quality of the material despite the numerous rips and tears rendering it unusable. Even in its ruined state, it had offered some protection in the swift current.</p><p>"Floating down from upstream...Could it be from Moonlit Ridge?  More internal strife?"</p><p>He glanced upstream, frowning. His spiritual sense swept over the corpse, including the rusty finger ring, finding nothing unusual.  Finally, his gaze fixed on two pouches at the corpse's waist.</p><p>"What kind of pouches are these? So strange…Which one is the Seed-Pearl pouch?"</p><p>He muttered to himself. He'd encountered priests from larger settlements and foreign Witch God emissaries, knowing human cultivators favored a storage device called a Seed-Pearl pouch, superior to those of his own people.  Many of his people's Witch God emissaries had adopted human customs, using terms like "cultivator" or "immortal cultivator" instead. Only in remote places like the Western Frontier did old traditions linger.</p><p>Neither pouch resembled a Seed-Pearl pouch.</p><p>"Could they be for raising insects? Or...were they looted?"</p><p>His smile vanished, his face falling. He grabbed one, probing it with his spiritual sense. He encountered a soul imprint, easily opening the pouch.</p><p>"Buzz…"</p><p>A high-pitched buzzing filled the valley. A massive cloud of blood erupted from the pouch.  He saw the monstrous, blood-winged insects within, and froze, his face whiter than the corpse.</p><p>He screamed. A small green light shot from his abdomen. A jade mantis, no bigger than a finger, its blades flashing.  Against the vicious blood cloud, the mantis was pathetically weak, instantly devoured, leaving not a trace.</p><p>He barely managed to summon his golden sword before the blood cloud engulfed him.</p><p>"Aaah!"</p><p>A piercing scream echoed through the mountains, startling the birds and beasts.</p><p>(Thanks to Ma Mang Meng Kuai for the generous contribution!
