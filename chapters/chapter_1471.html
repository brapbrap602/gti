<h1>Chapter 1463: Xiao Xiangzi (4k, Two-in-One)</h1><p>Chapter 1463: Xiao Xiangzi (4k, Two-in-One)</p><p>“I haven’t fully grasped the First Seal, the Auspicious Seal, but I can already use it in combat.  Understanding the First Seal has made comprehending the Lotus Seal easier than expected. Each seal in the *Seven Master Buddha Seals* is unique, yet they’re intrinsically connected; each one builds upon the last. I’ve seen similar branching techniques in other schools of Daoism, but none are as tightly interwoven as this.  I wonder if this is a characteristic of body-cultivation divine abilities…”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his focus from the divine ability, a new understanding dawning within him.</p><p>He put away the jade slip, removed the protective barrier, and flew out of the palanquin with Tong Lingyu.  In the east, they saw a black line on the horizon, stretching north to south as far as the eye could see.</p><p>The Hidden Sun Region of the Four Borders of the North Sea!</p><p>Tong Lingyu put away the palanquin and the fish whistle, then fed the abyssal whale several spirit pills as a reward, smiling as she patted it. “Go home!”</p><p>Perhaps due to the spirit pills, the abyssal whale seemed more intelligent, its eyes brighter and more lively. It stared at Tong Lingyu for a moment before slowly swimming into the deep sea.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Waves of water receded into the distance.</p><p>A whale’s song echoed faintly.</p><p>The abyssal whale, clearly reluctant to leave, bid farewell with a series of calls.</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned to see Qin Sang gazing at the Hidden Sun Region.  “Our current location is in the southern part of the Hidden Sun Region. If we land here and travel east, we’ll reach the Xuan Tian Palace.  The palace is situated atop Lingxiao Peak, surrounded by seventy-two naturally formed cold springs that create seventy-two lakes scattered amongst the mountains.  A perpetual, ethereal mist hangs in the air, making the lakes seem almost illusory. The most wondrous is the Everlasting Spring at the foot of Lingxiao Peak; it never freezes, no matter how cold it gets.  Each of the other seventy-one springs also possesses its unique mysteries…”</p><p>Tong Lingyu invited Qin Sang to depart, explaining about the Xuan Tian Palace as they flew.</p><p>Qin Sang had already gathered information beforehand, so he now had a clearer picture of the Hidden Sun Region and the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>The environment of the Hidden Sun Region was drastically different from other parts of the North Sea.</p><p>It was perpetually cold, with snow falling for all but a quarter of the year.  The common people had to make the most of the short growing season; any delay, and the blizzards would destroy everything.</p><p>As a result, while the Hidden Sun Region was vast and flat, its population was sparse.</p><p>Originally, like the Crescent Moon Region, the Hidden Sun Region housed many cultivation sects.  However, they were eventually unified under the Xuan Tian Palace, with other sects either disappearing or merging into it.</p><p>Today, the Xuan Tian Palace is divided into four main branches: Xuan Tian, Tian Shan, Zi Xia Xuan, and Ting Xue Lou.  It’s said that only the Xuan Tian branch is the direct lineage of the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>However, time has blurred the past, and rumors are often inaccurate.</p><p>Whether there are internal conflicts or hidden dangers within the Xuan Tian Palace is unknown to outsiders.</p><p>After listening carefully to Tong Lingyu, Qin Sang asked, “Are all four branches located on Lingxiao Peak?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Tong Lingyu used some kind of divine ability; as they reached the shore, two graceful cries echoed from deep within the snowy mountains.  Two magnificent birds, their bodies pure white with feathers like strands of ice, emerged from the snow and flew gracefully around Tong Lingyu.</p><p>The palanquin was attached to the birds, and they soared eastward.</p><p>“Lingxiao Peak is the forbidden area of the Xuan Tian Palace. Only the Palace Master usually cultivates there. The elders and various halls of the Xuan Tian Palace occupy the seventy-two springs. Of the four branches, only the Xuan Tian branch resides near the seventy-two springs.  Tian Shan, Zi Xia Xuan, and Ting Xue Lou are located elsewhere in the Hidden Sun Region; Ting Xue Lou is in the north.  Only for major events, like the opening of a sacred site, do the branches gather on Lingxiao Peak.”</p><p>At this point, Tong Lingyu sighed.  “With two Great Saints among the demons growing increasingly rampant and repeatedly invading the Hidden Sun Region, causing much bloodshed, the inner sect masters have been taking turns guarding the border, and the seventy-two springs are no longer as lively as they once were.”</p><p>…</p><p>It was the cold season in the Hidden Sun Region.</p><p>They hadn’t flown far when the sky suddenly darkened, a blizzard sweeping in with a biting wind.</p><p>However, the palanquin was unaffected, remaining warm and comfortable inside.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down; the land was covered in a blanket of snow, devoid of human presence.  Occasionally, they saw a few cities, lonely specks in the endless snowscape.</p><p>The scenery was monotonous.</p><p>After a few glances, Qin Sang lost interest and resumed his contemplation of the *Seven Master Buddha Seals*.</p><p>After an indeterminate time, Qin Sang was awakened by the birds’ chirping. The palanquin paused slightly. Looking out, the scenery had completely changed.</p><p>Before him lay a breathtaking panorama of ice and snow, stretching for thousands of miles.</p><p>Snow-capped mountains stretched endlessly, like a crouching dragon.</p><p>Countless icy lakes dotted the valleys below.</p><p>In the dead of winter, the cold lakes were frozen solid, reflecting the sky like countless mirrors embedded in the earth.  They shimmered, translucent, resembling the scales of a celestial dragon.  The scene was breathtaking, stretching endlessly to the horizon.</p><p>In the far distance, a majestic mountain, piercing the clouds, loomed into view.</p><p>A thin, almost imperceptible mist hung around the snowy mountains and frozen lakes, not obscuring the view.  Qin Sang, however, sensed something more.  He perceived the subtle power of a protective formation within the mist; the scope of the Xuan Tian Palace's defensive array was truly vast—a testament to its status as the foremost sect in the North Sea!</p><p>At that moment, the spirit birds broke free from their restraints, chirped to Tong Lingyu, and flew towards the snow-capped mountain, disappearing from sight.</p><p>"That's Lingxiao Peak," Tong Lingyu indicated the mountain, "The treasure vault is located near Qingbai Spring, one of the Seventy-Two Springs. Let's collect our treasures first. Afterwards, I'll show my hospitality. Please forgive any shortcomings."</p><p>Qin Sang remained agreeable throughout their journey.</p><p>The imminent recovery of the sacred artifact visibly relaxed Tong Lingyu.  And what reason would Qin Sang have to object to acquiring treasures?</p><p>He followed Tong Lingyu into the formation, flying directly towards Lingxiao Peak.  The mist thickened, obscuring most of the mountain's features.</p><p>Yet, Lingxiao Peak, lush and verdant even in the depths of winter, was a sight to behold.  Ice pagodas and pavilions, all crafted from translucent ice, dotted its slopes, a unique and wondrous spectacle.</p><p>Nearing the peak, Tong Lingyu stopped above a frozen lake, its water strangely divided—half green, half white.</p><p>She produced a token, infused it with her spiritual energy, and with a gentle flick of her wrist, sent a shimmering light into the ice.  Moments later, the ice silently melted, opening a passage to a staircase leading to the lake's bottom.</p><p>"Please, Daoist friend."</p><p>Tong Lingyu entered the ice cave, followed closely by Qin Sang.  Not far below, their view opened up to a vast, ice-built hall.</p><p>"Greetings, Grand Elder."</p><p>A figure emerged from the depths of the hall and bowed to Tong Lingyu.  The person was stooped, with snow-white hair and a frail bearing.</p><p>Tong Lingyu rushed forward to support him, calling out, "Master Lu…"</p><p>Her lips moved silently, communicating privately with Master Lu.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance, observing the hall and the elder, a sense of awe settling upon him.  The elder was clearly a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator, his cultivation likely on par with Tong Lingyu.</p><p>His breath was shallow, his energy waning—perhaps from an old injury.  Qin Sang suspected that he had barely survived a recent tribulation, bearing lingering wounds and approaching the end of his life, making him hesitant to engage in combat.  Yet, a cultivator such as this, driven to desperation, could still be a formidable opponent, a hidden pillar of strength within Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered how Tong Lingyu would navigate this interaction.</p><p>The elder lifted his withered eyelids, glancing at Qin Sang, then pointed to the ice wall behind him, before turning to leave with a raspy voice, "Grand Elder, please help yourself."</p><p>"Thank you, Master Lu."</p><p>After watching the elder depart, Tong Lingyu gestured for Qin Sang to follow her to the ice wall. The wall turned transparent, revealing the entrance to the treasure vault.</p><p>Unhindered, Qin Sang entered, encountering countless shelves overflowing with treasures.  Their radiant glow filled the vault, dazzling and mesmerizing.  He could only think, "A profusion of beauty almost blinds."</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned, noticing Qin Sang standing in awe, surveying the abundance. She smiled smugly, "Daoist friend, you may select any three items."</p><p>Jadeite essence, cloud soul crystals, earth rot bone…</p><p>Dragon saliva, green spirit ginseng, sandman fruit…</p><p>Bottles of elixirs.</p><p>Artifacts and treasures.</p><p>Jade slips…</p><p>…</p><p>Rare and precious items, unheard of in the outside world, were arranged here like common goods.  Though not exceedingly valuable to Qin Sang, the sheer quantity and magnificence were breathtaking.  And this was just the entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang merely observed, touching nothing, steadily moving deeper into the vault.  Tong Lingyu patiently followed, understanding these treasures would not capture his interest.</p><p>As they delved further, the treasures grew more valuable and extraordinary.</p><p>"Taking all this back to Qingyang Temple would certainly make it the leading sect of the Northern Star Realm.  Once I reach the late Yuan Ying stage, unifying the Northern Star Realm might even be possible…"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled at the thought. His ambitions lay elsewhere.</p><p>Quickly, they reached the deepest part of the treasury. Qin Sang, without taking anything, saw an arched ice gate blocking their path.  Turning, he used his eyes to ask Tong Lingyu a question.</p><p>Tong Lingyu stepped forward and opened the archway, reminding Qin Sang, “This is the inner treasury. If even the inner treasury’s treasures cannot satisfy you, no one else can offer better terms.”</p><p>“I am not greedy,”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, stepping into the inner treasury.</p><p>The inner treasury was much smaller than the outer one, but the treasures were more precious.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept across the room, and he saw a jade bottle. His expression shifted slightly, and he walked over, observing it through the protective barrier.</p><p>The jade bottle contained a liquid as clear as water.</p><p>In the center of the liquid, a tiny vortex spun incessantly, emitting wisps of energy that adhered to the inside of the jade bottle, forming a layer of frost like snowflakes.</p><p>“Do you recognize this object? We’ve tried, but it’s unusable for refining artifacts, and we don't know what kind of pill needs it.  Seeing its unusual phenomena, we kept it here…”</p><p>Tong Lingyu approached, seeking Qin Sang’s opinion.</p><p>“This is Yuan Yin Water,”</p><p>Qin Sang said, making an excuse. “I once saw it mentioned in an ancient text…”</p><p>Yuan Yin Water was one of the three most important spiritual materials for the Ascension Ceremony.  Master Mu had given a detailed description of its characteristics: whether a single drop or more, a tiny vortex would always form and spin in its center – easily recognizable.</p><p>The bottle contained roughly four drops.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't planned to use this opportunity to exchange for materials for the Ascension Ceremony.  But seeing so much Yuan Yin Water, he hesitated. This substance was rare; Baihua Valley likely wouldn't have much to trade.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang didn't rashly take the Yuan Yin Water, deciding to look at other things first.</p><p>Tong Lingyu hoped Qin Sang would choose the Yuan Yin Water.  She knew his words weren't entirely true, but Xuantian Palace didn't know how to utilize it, so it was essentially useless there.</p><p>Turning, Qin Sang walked toward the jade slips. Tong Lingyu immediately pointed out the “Han Ming Gui Yin Yu Zhang.”</p><p>Its true name was only “Han Ming Gui Yin,”  as it was inscribed on a palm-sized jade screen.  The Xuantian Palace disciples added “Yu Zhang” themselves.</p><p>The jade screen was slightly curved, its surface engraved with hundreds of tiny characters, the compendium of secret techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned it; it matched what Liu Li had previously described.</p><p>After reading it, Qin Sang leaned towards choosing this external avatar technique, but still looked at other jade slips.</p><p>Qin Sang had his own insights into seeking cultivation techniques and secret arts. Ideally, he wanted to use the Jade Buddha to avoid danger, exploit loopholes, and achieve cultivation results that others could only dream of.</p><p>Unfortunately, in his centuries of cultivation, he had only obtained a few techniques, such as the “Yuanshen Yang Jian Zhang.”</p><p>There were many jade slips here, with more than half related to ice-type cultivation.</p><p>After a cursory glance, Qin Sang didn't find anything that met his requirements. He used the token Tong Lingyu gave him to touch the jade screen's protective barrier.</p><p>“Han Ming Gui Yin, I'll take it.”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A stream of light entered Qin Sang's forehead, the entire technique deeply imprinted in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed the technique was complete, then returned his attention, ready to choose a second item.</p><p>There were several spiritual materials that could further enhance the Jinchen Sword, but they weren't very important to him. If he couldn't find what he needed, Qin Sang planned to use his remaining two choices to exchange for the Yuan Yin Water and the Kan Shen Pearl.</p><p>His thoughts racing, Qin Sang quickly browsed most of the treasury. Just as he was about to go to the other side, he suddenly noticed a familiar object on a shelf in the middle of the treasury.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, a look of intense surprise flashing across his face.</p><p>It was a crystal-clear seven-story pagoda!</p><p>Similar in shape and size to the seven-story pagoda he'd obtained in the main hall of Jinghai Sect, the only difference was that his pagoda radiated light like a Buddha's glow, while this one was purely transparent, like carved ice.</p><p>“Could it be that a set of treasures was scattered, and only complete set can be activated?”</p><p>Qin Sang had a strong feeling that the two pagodas were connected.  Without showing any emotion, he glanced at the other treasures, slowly approaching the seven-story pagoda.</p><p>At that moment, he caught sight of a slightly yellowed portrait hanging on the far wall of the treasury.</p><p>The person depicted had a refined air and extraordinary bearing.</p><p>It was the same person as the statue enshrined in the Jinghai Sect’s Buddha Hall!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>What was the relationship between Jinghai Sect and Xuantian Palace that they would both worship the same person? The appearance of the Wu Bian Hai Buddhist Sect – Tong Lingyu should have received news, yet remained unmoved?</p><p>He had so many questions. He turned to Tong Lingyu, pointing at the portrait and curiously asking, “Daoist Tong, this scroll doesn’t seem to be a magical artifact.  Who is this senior depicted?”</p><p>Tong Lingyu stepped forward, looked at the portrait, and replied, “This is Senior Xiao Xiangzi.”</p>
