<h1>**Chapter 217: Yun Youzi**</h1><p>**Chapter 217: Yun Youzi**</p><p>The old man brushed past Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head, watching the old man walk all the way to the end of the street. Just as he was about to disappear into the crowd, his figure suddenly flashed. He quickly caught up to the old man.</p><p>"Senior, please wait!"</p><p>The old man stopped in his tracks, looking curiously at Qin Sang, who was blocking his way. His eyes held a hint of caution. "Fellow Daoist, why are you stopping me?"</p><p>Qin Sang performed a "jishou," a respectful half-bow, and said respectfully, "Junior was reckless. Please forgive me, Senior. I dare to ask... is Senior's Daoist name Yun Youzi?"</p><p>His identity revealed by a stranger, the old man stroked his long beard and narrowed his eyes at Qin Sang. Frowning, he thought for a moment. "Fellow Daoist, do you truly know me? But... I don't believe we've ever met."</p><p>"Senior indeed does not know me."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded solemnly. "Senior, so you are Daoist Yun Youzi? I wonder if Senior remembers Ji Xin?"</p><p>Upon hearing this name, the old man's expression changed slightly. He raised his eyes to the sky, his gaze suddenly becoming distant, as if stretching back dozens of years in time. After a long pause, he looked at Qin Sang and asked, "The Ji Xin you speak of, is he the disciple I adopted in the secular world? How did you come to know Ji Xin?"</p><p>...</p><p>"Junior is originally from the Ning country. When I was fifteen, I followed my elders on a business trip. On the way, I was captured and imprisoned by bandits. By a stroke of luck, I escaped and wandered into Da Sui. I was kindly taken in by Daoist Ji Xin. Later, by chance, I embarked on the path of cultivation... Speaking of which, my smooth cultivation journey also has a lot to do with a medicinal bath formula left behind by Senior..."</p><p>In a quiet tavern.</p><p>The two ordered wine and food, sitting opposite each other.</p><p>Qin Sang softly told Yun Youzi the story of how he came to know Daoist Ji Xin.</p><p>Recalling the past, Qin Sang's face showed a sense of nostalgia and regret.</p><p>He had been struggling on the path of cultivation, devoting himself to his practice. In the past, he hardly had the time to recall the past. Now he thought back to when he ascended to Qing Yang Temple at the age of fifteen. Now, he was already past his prime.</p><p>Unbelievably, it had been over forty years.</p><p>"The formula for the medicinal bath?"</p><p>Yun Youzi pondered for a moment and smiled, "Brother Qin, you mean the Yang Sui Decoction? It is indeed effective for beginners. I also discovered it by accident when I was traveling the world. It came from a martial arts grandmaster in Da Sui. The ingredients used in the recipe are all mortal medicines, but they are effective for cultivators, which is quite rare."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and stood up to perform a deep bow. "Junior has not yet thanked Senior. I thought Senior was a mortal, but I never expected you to be a cultivator as well. Could it be that Daoist Ji Xin is also..."</p><p>After a bow, Qin Sang sat back down and looked at Yun Youzi with anticipation.</p><p>He would never have thought that Ji Xin's master, Yun Youzi, was also a cultivator!</p><p>During the New Year while he was at Qing Yang Temple, Ji Xin once brought out Yun Youzi's portrait for worship. Qin Sang worshipped it too, and met the man in the painting.</p><p>So when he suddenly met Yun Youzi, Qin Sang immediately felt a sense of familiarity. He thought about the people he had met after coming to this world, but could not find the reason until he suddenly remembered the portrait.</p><p>According to Daoist Ji Xin, when the portrait was made, Yun Youzi was already in his seventies.</p><p>Yun Youzi was sitting right in front of him now. Although he looked a little older than the portrait, his face was still the same. He even looked more energetic than in the painting.</p><p>If Yun Youzi is a cultivator, could it be that Ji Xin and Yue Ming are also cultivators? Could they have seen through all the small acts he had done in Qing Yang Temple?</p><p>Did Daoist Ji Xin give him the prescription out of pity, seeing that his cultivation was arduous?</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly. In order to seek immortality, he left Qing Yang Temple. Now it seemed like he had taken the long way around. The true immortal was right in front of him, but due to his ignorance, he failed to recognize Mount Lu.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was also secretly curious. Ever since he began living at Qing Yang Temple, he had never seen Ji Xin or Yue Ming use any abilities beyond those of mortals. Daoist Ji Xin, in order to help the disaster victims, willingly starved himself and ate rough vegetables.</p><p>Of the money Qin Sang had seized from the bandits, after buying a copy of "Fist of the Crouching Tiger," most of it had been donated to the temple.</p><p>Could it be that they were suppressing their cultivation in order to refine their Dao hearts by living among mortals?</p><p>Qin Sang was lost in his thoughts when he saw Yun Youzi shake his head and say, "Ji Xin is not a cultivator, at least not when I left. Because I also met with an opportunity for cultivation after my separation from Ji Xin, and I never went back. Speaking of which, Ji Xin taking in Brother Qin and me meeting with Brother Qin today... Fate is truly a wondrous thing."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was completely stunned, unsure if he had misheard or not as he said in utter shock, "This junior heard from Daoist Priest Jixin that you were already seventy years old when you and he departed..."</p><p>Cloud Pilgrim said he had only met an immortal after parting ways with Daoist Priest Jixin, which was when he was already in his seventies!</p><p>Qin Sang saw very clearly that Cloud Pilgrim's current cultivation base was clearly at the initial stage of the Foundation Establishment Period, and his aura was even a bit stronger than his own!</p><p>Cloud Pilgrim smiled lightly and said, "At the age of fifteen, this old priest's medical skills were unrivaled in the world, and I was summoned to the palace to become an imperial physician. When I was forty-seven years old, I committed a major offense and nearly lost my life. Disheartened and disappointed, I left home to become a priest and called myself Cloud Pilgrim. At the age of seventy-two, I understood the decree of Heaven and suddenly realized that my days were numbered. Thinking back on my past, I understood that there was great terror between life and death. Not willing to become dried bones in a tomb, I suddenly had the idea to go out and search for immortals. Coincidentally, Jixin had already grown up and had mastered all of this old priest's teachings, so that same year, I put my medicine kit on my back once again and traveled west on foot with only my staff. Six years later, while gathering medicinal herbs on a desolate mountain, I met my master. I was fortunate enough to receive guidance from my master, and so at the age of seventy-eight, I began cultivating the Dao. Because I was old and frail, I painstakingly cultivated for forty years, and it was only at the age of one hundred and eighteen that I managed to build a foundation. This also came at a price. Compared to you, Little Elder Brother Qin, who is young and has such a high cultivation base, my future is limitless!"</p><p>Listening to Cloud Pilgrim talk in such a leisurely way, Qin Sang felt like he was listening to a mysterious and fantastical story. The more he listened, the more surprised he became.</p><p>A common consensus in the realm of immortal cultivation was that for Qi Condensation Period cultivators, after the age of fifty, their vitality would decline, and their spiritual souls would begin to age, making the hope of reaching Foundation Establishment more and more slim. The only way would be to find spirit medicines that could make up for this loss, and every single one of these spirit medicines was extremely valuable and their medicinal effects could not be combined.</p><p>Meng Ruhui had already reached the twelfth level of the Qi Condensation Period when he was fifty-eight. Feeling that there was no hope of reaching Foundation Establishment, he gave up on the path of immortality and became a steward in the Yuanzhao Sect.</p><p>At that age, Cloud Pilgrim was still a mortal!</p><p>He had begun cultivating at the advanced age of seventy-eight, and had never given up, painstakingly cultivating for forty years before somehow managing to build a foundation at the age of one hundred and eighteen. This could be called shocking the world, and Qin Sang had never heard of anything like it before!</p><p>"This junior... is impressed!"</p><p>Countless words were condensed into these two words of admiration.</p><p>If he switched places, if he was still a mortal nearing the age of eighty, physically weak and frail, would he still be able to have the opportunity to encounter an immortal, and would he have the unwavering will to succeed or die trying?</p><p>Qin Sang felt uncertain.</p><p>He had always thought that his heart for the Dao was unwavering, but compared to this 'old man' in front of him, he was nothing!</p><p>Qin Sang raised his wine cup with both hands and toasted Cloud Pilgrim.</p><p>Even if they were complete strangers, this was still a Daoist friend worthy of respect.</p>
