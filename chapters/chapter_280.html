<h1>Chapter 273: Return</h1><p>Chapter 273: Return</p><p>Excluding the Nascent Soul cultivators, twenty-seven individuals had entered the Ancient Ruins. Now, only sixteen had gathered by the stone monument.</p><p>Of course, it was possible that some people, such as Scattered Immortal Yunqiong, had given up halfway through the trial and left the Ancient Ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived and, upon finding Mu Yifeng and Yu Daiyue present, he approached them.</p><p>"Fellow-uncle Che and the others still haven't come out?" Qin Sang asked in a low voice.</p><p>Mu Yifeng shook his head, his gaze fixated on the west with a solemn expression. "After the change, Venerable Sikong ordered us to leave and wait, while he personally went to meet Fellow-uncle Che and the others."</p><p>The collapse accelerated, with some spatial rifts merging to form an enormous one, over a thousand feet wide. It resembled the gaping maw of a monster, ready to devour any intruder.</p><p>With space being torn apart, it presented an extremely bizarre sight. Some lava rivers suddenly stopped flowing, while in other areas, vast tracts of land and mountains were inverted, defying all logic. This phenomenon became more severe the closer one got to the four celestial peaks.</p><p>Yet, the Nascent Soul cultivators had still not emerged. Elder Dique and Daoist Xuanyu were unlikely to appear, but the other three had also not shown themselves.</p><p>Surely, all five Golden Cores couldn't have perished? Qin Sang thought to himself, gazing at the apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Losing five Golden Cores would be a major blow to the various sects. Even the Eight Righteous Paths had limited Nascent Soul cultivators in their ranks.</p><p>The Green Luan Sect had been dealt the worst blow of all, as their Sect Master was among those missing.</p><p>After waiting a while longer, the lava and Fire Spirit Beasts invaded in full force, drawing closer and closer to the stone monument. The Golden Core cultivators remained out of sight, and the others began to grow restless and anxious.</p><p>Just then, someone suddenly exclaimed, "Look there!" and pointed to the distance.</p><p>Upon straining their eyes, they saw three small lights flickering between the spatial rifts. The space was far from stable and was still in constant flux, with some rifts expanding or even drifting about.</p><p>The lights were moving cautiously among them, managing to avoid being devoured by the spatial rifts just in the nick of time. Though they were too far away to make out any details, it was still a thrilling sight.</p><p>Finally, the lights managed to emerge from the spatial rifts, only to be met by a horde of raging Fire Spirit Beasts.</p><p>Despite their numbers, the Fire Spirit Beasts were still relatively sparse compared to the vast expanse of the ruins. For Nascent Soul cultivators, they weren't a significant problem and were easily brushed aside.</p><p>Before long, three figures materialized before the others, revealing themselves as Che Yutao and his companions.</p><p>Venerable Sikong Muyue and Elder Du Yi looked fine, but Che Yutao appeared disheveled. There was a large gash on his left arm, where a substantial chunk of flesh had been torn away.</p><p>Che Yutao ignored his wound for now, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. His expression darkened, and he demanded, "Where's Daoist Xuanyu?"</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator's aura descended upon the others, leaving them breathless and feeling like mountains were pressing down on them. Horrified, a Foundation Establishment latter-stage cultivator forced out the words, "Reporting to Fellow-uncle Che, after the change, we have not seen the two Masters. They... they seem not to have come out yet..."</p><p>Che Yutao and his companions' faces changed drastically upon hearing this. They exchanged glances, and Venerable Sikong Muyue said in a low voice, "When the change began, I sent them out, then returned to meet you. I didn't encounter the two Fellow Daoists."</p><p>Elder Du Yi looked around and asked in surprise, "Fellow Daoist Xuanyu and I ascended the celestial peak and became trapped after encountering danger. That's understandable, but why hasn't Elder Dique come out yet? Could he also be trapped in a restriction?"</p><p>By this time, the Fire Spirit Beasts were getting closer and closer. Lava was even starting to seep out of the ground near the stone monument.</p><p>Venerable Sikong Muyue shook her head and said to Che Yutao, "This is not a place to stay for long. We should leave first. I think the collapse is beginning to slow down. This place should not be completely destroyed. The two Fellow Daoists are protected by fate, and as long as they can find a hiding place, they should be fine. We can think about a way to rescue them after the ruins stabilize."</p><p>Che Yutao remained silent, his expression dark and inscrutable.</p><p>Elder Du Yi spoke up, "Venerable Sikong's suggestion is sound. We must first ensure our own safety before we can spare resources to rescue our Fellow Daoists. Failing that, we can send someone back to Hanging Pass for reinforcements."</p><p>Seeing that the two were of the same mind, Che Yutao had no choice but to nod in agreement.</p><p>Before entering the stone monument, Qin Sang glanced back before returning his gaze forward. He stepped into the monument.</p><p>The world spun, and when his vision returned, he found himself standing on the rubble outside the ruins. Aside from Scattered Immortal Yunqiong, three people had also given up on the trial and were waiting there.</p><p>In total, six Foundation Establishment cultivators had lost their lives within the ruins.</p><p>Their disheveled appearances naturally startled Scattered Immortal Yunqiong and the others. After hearing what had happened, they were filled with relief.</p><p>Che Yutao and his companions conferred briefly, then planted themselves by the entrance, showing no intention of leaving.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others waited for orders. They didn't dare to leave without permission, so they sat on the ground nearby. Some of them regulated their breathing, and others treated their injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang looked inward at the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm in his Qi Sea. Despite his impatience, he didn't use his Divine Understanding to probe it. Instead, he let it recuperate on its own.</p><p>Qin Sang then laid several restrictions in his Qi Sea, completely hiding the aura of the Charm.</p><p>Just as Old Man Dique said, the Charm didn't belong to anyone, so as long as no one forcibly searched his Qi Sea, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm wouldn't be exposed.</p><p>After sealing the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes. He saw Che Yutao and the other two standing in a triangular formation near the entrance. They would occasionally release their Martial Arts to stimulate the appearance of the Black Hole and observe the changes within.</p><p>The stone tablet inside the Black Hole was initially calm, but it suddenly trembled violently. The Black Hole emitted a large amount of black light, as if it had transformed into a black sun.</p><p>The three Core Formation Cultivators quickly released their Martial Arts, creating a large restriction to block the black light. They wanted to prevent the strange phenomenon from attracting Cloud Beasts.</p><p>This continued for three days.</p><p>Finally, the Black Hole disappeared completely. The black light dispersed, and the stone tablet appeared, standing in the middle of the circular rubble. Everyone was astonished.</p><p>Though the stone tablet was covered in cracks, it was still intact. It had managed to avoid being crushed.</p><p>They waited for another three days. It remained calm, and there were no abnormalities.</p><p>It seemed that the ancient ruins were stable on the inside.</p><p>Sikong Muyue cautiously walked up to the stone tablet and placed her palm on it. Spirit Power surged from her palm, as if she was investigating it. After a long while, she said, "The Testing Grounds have been destroyed. That's why the entrance has been exposed."</p><p>Che Yutao and the others discussed it and summoned everyone. They wanted to re-enter the ancient ruins.</p><p>No one knew what dangers lurked within the ancient ruins. Qin Sang and the others were reluctant, but they had no choice but to obey. They formed a massive Nine Radiance Star River Formation, with the three Gold Core Cultivators leading it. As a group, they entered the Black Hole and walked towards the stone tablet.</p><p>After they entered, it was just as Sikong Muyue expected. They were not sent into the Testing Grounds but entered the ruins directly.</p>
