<h1>Chapter 370: The Cold Gold Ore</h1><p>Despite their considerable strength, the group was driven into desperate straits by the pursuing evil spirits.</p><p>Kong Xin darted into a cave, and the others hastily followed, only to discover that the cave was a dead end!</p><p>In an instant, the entrance was blocked by evil spirits, and the ghostly wails outside grew increasingly shrill, indicating a disturbing number of roused spirits within the earth caverns.</p><p>Everyone's expression changed drastically, their gazes fixing on Kong Xin with undisguised hostility.  Even Qin Sang harbored murderous intent.</p><p>While Kong Xin's earlier harmless lies to take shortcuts were somewhat understandable, leading them into a dead end was tantamount to endangering their lives, an unforgivable offense.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>The woman in red roared, her weapon pointed directly at Kong Xin, killing intent evident.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Kong Xin remained calm and composed, seemingly unafraid.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, puzzled by Kong Xin's actions. He was trapped as well; if they died, he would be the first. No fool would engineer their own demise.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang shifted his gaze from Kong Xin to examine the surrounding environment. His eyes narrowed slightly as he observed the cave walls.</p><p>At this moment, Kong Xin calmly pointed towards the depths of the cave. "Everyone, take a look at these walls.  Do you notice anything different from the outside?"</p><p>Everyone paused, turning to look.</p><p>Prompted by Kong Xin, they finally noticed that the cave walls here weren't entirely black like the ones outside. A faint white, cold light emanated from within the stone.</p><p>In the most prominent spot, they could even discern the outline of a fingernail-sized crystal.</p><p>“These…”</p><p>The first to recognize the cold light was the cultivator surnamed Bao.  He spoke with astonishment, “Could this be Cold Gold Ore?”</p><p>“Cold Gold?”</p><p>Most had heard of Cold Gold.</p><p>Qin Sang had recognized it even before Bao.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu's notes had described several rare spiritual materials, including Cold Gold. Incorporating Cold Gold into weapons not only imbued them with extreme cold properties but also significantly increased their durability. It was a truly valuable material.</p><p>They hadn't even reached the heart of the Boundless Valley, and they had already stumbled upon a Cold Gold vein. It truly was a land of treasures.</p><p>Kong Xin nodded.</p><p>“Indeed, this is Cold Gold Ore. After refinement, it yields the precious Cold Gold.</p><p>“Originally, the number of spirits gathered above was far greater than this. Myriads of spirits occupied the surrounding mountains, making it a perilous deathtrap that no one dared to approach.  This hidden passage remained undiscovered.</p><p>“Otherwise, the Cold Gold Ore would have been mined long ago.</p><p>“After the recent upheaval, I noticed a drastic change in this spirit nest. The number of spirits had significantly decreased.  I stealthily infiltrated to investigate and discovered this hidden passage and the Cold Gold Ore.</p><p>“Unfortunately, my cultivation is too weak to mine it alone, and I dared not spread the word. If I collaborated with other factions, I would likely be swallowed whole.  I had no choice but to resort to this strategy.</p><p>“If you aren't interested in the Cold Gold, I won't force you. We can work together to fight our way out. The exit is not far ahead, and escaping shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>“However, this secret likely won't remain hidden for long.  This passage will eventually be discovered, and the Cold Gold Ore will fall into someone else's hands…</p><p>“Returning empty-handed from a treasure trove… I wonder if you will regret it?”</p><p>Bao asked suspiciously, “What do you mean?  Are you willing to share this Cold Gold Ore with us?”</p><p>Kong Xin replied frankly, “Finders keepers, but sharing is caring.  I understand this principle. The mined Cold Gold Ore will be divided equally among everyone present. Consider it my apology. Otherwise, I doubt you would forgive my earlier actions. Furthermore, with the evil spirits lurking outside, we need to work together to mine the Cold Gold Ore."</p><p>By now, more and more evil spirits had gathered, assaulting the cave entrance, increasing the pressure on the group.</p><p>Kong Xin fell silent, awaiting their decision.</p><p>Bao suddenly chuckled and looked around at the group.  "With such treasures before us, surely none of you will simply give up?  Although the evil spirits are strong, if we combine our strengths and use our trump cards, we should be able to hold them off for a while. We can mine as much as we can and retreat if the situation becomes unfavorable.  We're all seasoned cultivators who understand the importance of discretion. As long as we exercise caution, we shouldn’t fear meeting a grim end, should we?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt tempted as well.</p><p>A fist-sized Cold Gold Ore could only yield a grain of rice-sized piece of refined Cold Gold. However, the entire cave wall shimmered with the cold light. If the vein was large enough, even after dividing it among everyone, it would still be a worthwhile endeavor.</p><p>However, the primary mission was paramount.</p><p>Qin Sang exchanged a glance with Yun Youzi, who nodded slightly in agreement.</p><p>Evidently, the allure of Cold Gold was too strong to resist. No one pursued Kong Xin's earlier deception any further.</p><p>Without delay, they adjusted their formation and joined forces to withstand the onslaught of evil spirits, buying time for Kong Xin. Kong Xin retrieved a shimmering blue sword, channeled his spiritual energy, and with a flash of blue light, struck the cave wall.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A crisp sound echoed.</p><p>The blue light vanished, startling everyone.</p><p>Kong Xin's full-powered strike had only left a shallow mark on the wall!</p><p>Kong Xin said with a wry smile, "This place has birthed the Cold Gold Ore, and the entire vein has been affected by the Cold Gold, causing the surrounding stone to undergo a transformation, making it incredibly hard. This Blue Light Sword is the sharpest I could find, despite my best efforts. I've also tried Five Elements spells and other methods, but they were all ineffective. We can only rely on brute force to slowly mine it..."</p><p>The others exchanged glances.</p><p>If Kong Xin could only manage a scratch with each strike, how long would it take to mine the entire vein?</p><p>“I refuse to believe a few measly rocks can withstand my weapon!”</p><p>The woman in red snorted, withdrawing her weapon from defending against the spirits and thrusting it towards the wall.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The needle-like weapon easily pierced the wall. But before she could celebrate, she felt a strong resistance. The weapon penetrated less than an inch before stopping, its force spent.</p><p>The weapon vibrated, attempting to break the stone, but the wall remained unyielding.</p><p>The woman in red reluctantly retrieved her weapon, tried again several times with the same result, her face alternating between pale and flushed.  She remained silent.</p><p>Bao and the elder summoned their own weapons, but they fared no better than Kong Xin.</p><p>Kong Xin silently continued to hack away with his sword, his efficiency disappointingly low. It took dozens of strikes to extract a single piece of Cold Gold Ore.</p><p>Qin Sang swung the Black Dragon Stone repeatedly at the evil spirits outside, but they kept coming. Even with their combined efforts, how long they could hold out remained uncertain.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang communicated with Yun Youzi and then spoke aloud, “Fellow Daoist Kong, I have a spirit sword.  While its quality is not exceptional, I’m quite confident in its sharpness. Perhaps we could switch. I'll mine the Cold Gold, and you can defend against the spirit onslaught.”</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword, crafted from the fragments of a magical treasure and further tempered by killing talismans, might not excel in other aspects, but its sharpness was undoubtedly superior to other weapons.</p>
