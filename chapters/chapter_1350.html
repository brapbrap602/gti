<h1>Chapter 1342: Soul Gathering Battle</h1><p>“Hssssss…”</p><p>The Blood Infant was tiny, its escape light as thin as a hair.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't allow them to escape so easily. Without hesitation, he manipulated his sword訣.</p><p>The ebony sword flashed, appearing above the Blood Infant. Sword lights rained down like a downpour.</p><p>The sword array was about to form.</p><p>The Blood Infant's shriek became even sharper. It tilted its head, staring intently at the ebony sword. Its tiny eyes were filled with intense crimson, and a powerful aura erupted from its body.</p><p>The Blood Infants' auras were connected.</p><p>It wasn't just a simple connection between them.</p><p>All the Blood Infants in the entire Soul Shadow array were linked.</p><p>At this moment, some Blood Infants were deployed by Ye Laomo and the Jade Bone Sect to control the blood clouds and Yin ghosts, attacking intruders and preventing them from approaching the blood-colored altar to disrupt their grand scheme.</p><p>Others surrounded them, unsealing the altar.</p><p>The Blood Infants' resistance was far stronger than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>Blood light shot out from the Blood Infant's skull and converged in the void.</p><p>In an instant, the ebony sword was struck. A crisp sound echoed as the ebony sword was knocked away, its sword lights shattering, and the sword array dissolving into nothingness.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's true killing move wasn't the sword array.</p><p>The ebony sword was merely a feint.</p><p>As the Blood Infants focused on the sword array, eighteen demonic banners silently emerged from Qin Sang's sleeves.  The Nine Netherworld demonic fire surged forth, with the speed of lightning, powerfully erupting!</p><p>The demonic fire shook the heavens, and the ghost mist retreated.</p><p>Killing intent surged like a sea, as if a fire dragon roared, opening its bloody maw and lunging at one of the Blood Infants!</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was impossible to capture all the Blood Infants. To be safe, he targeted only one.</p><p>The demonic fire startled the Blood Infant, filling it with terror. Its shrill cry was laced with fear.</p><p>They retaliated with blood light, but in their haste, the blood light was much weaker than before.  The demonic fire hardly paused, crushing the blood light effortlessly!</p><p>The Blood Infant targeted by the demonic fire screamed in despair as it was engulfed.</p><p>The other Blood Infants scattered and fled.</p><p>‘Whew!’</p><p>The demonic fire didn't pursue, transforming into a ball and floating quietly in mid-air.</p><p>The flames within were not calm. The Blood Infant was still struggling, frantically trying to break free. It was connected to the Soul Shadow array and could borrow its power; it hadn't lost its combat ability.</p><p>However, within the demonic fire, it was a futile struggle.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted a live captive; he hadn't intended to kill. Otherwise, a sweep of the demonic fire would have reduced it to ashes.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang summoned back the ebony sword and inspected it.  Indeed, being forged from one of the Ten Divine Woods, the sword was unmarked.</p><p>He flew to the side of the demonic fire and used hand seals to isolate the Blood Infant from the outside world, imprisoning it.</p><p>Following that, Zhen Daochang and others arrived successively.</p><p>While Qin Sang attacked the Blood Infant, the Blood Infants couldn't control the blood clouds and Yin ghosts. The pressure on them lessened significantly, allowing them to escape. They witnessed the demonic fire's power firsthand.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Guan had heard of Qin Sang's demonic fire, but this was his first time witnessing it. He couldn't help but stare for a moment longer, then glancing at the Yuan Ying spirit puppet standing behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Recalling various rumors about Qin Sang, the cultivator surnamed Guan sighed inwardly, "It won't be long before this person surpasses Ye Laomo and becomes the number one cultivator in Beichen."</p><p>"Yu Zhen Dao You!"</p><p>A tall and thin cultivator suddenly exclaimed, rushing towards the Blood Infant.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to intervene, but seeing the man's grief-stricken expression, he paused slightly. Recalling that this person was from the Abyss of Sin, he vaguely guessed the reason and didn't stop him.</p><p>He looked at the Blood Infant. It was clearly a female cultivator.</p><p>Yu Zhen wasn't a newly advanced Yuan Ying cultivator, but like Feng Laogui, she hadn't resisted temptation. However, she wasn't as fortunate as Feng Laogui. She fell victim to Ye Laomo's cruelty, her Yuan Ying extracted, leaving her a horrifying state.</p><p>The tall and thin cultivator's fingers trembled as he tried to touch the Blood Infant.</p><p>Though imprisoned, the Blood Infant remained ferocious, snapping its mouth to bite.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, be careful!"</p><p>Qin Sang warned.</p><p>Zhen Daochang also flew over, exchanging a glance with Qin Sang. After carefully examining the Blood Infant, he sighed and shook his head.  "It's no longer Yu Zhen Dao You. Ye Laomo's secret technique was too vicious.  There's nothing that can be done. Fellow Daoist, please accept your grief."</p><p>The tall and thin cultivator understood the implication.</p><p>He’d managed to capture the Blood Infant, certainly intending to use it to analyze the evil array.</p><p>A Yuan Ying cultivator, showing no emotion, retreated and sat cross-legged in mid-air, closing his eyes and silently chanting a sutra, choosing not to watch Zhen Daochang and Qin Sang.  The others also subdued their joy and cooperated silently.</p><p>Just then, the blood clouds and ghostly apparitions returned.</p><p>The escaped Blood Infants, restless, stirred up trouble again, but having learned their lesson, they hid themselves well this time.  Even the Celestial Eye Butterflies found them difficult to detect.</p><p>…</p><p>“No! It’s not the Sacred Fire!”</p><p>Yu Gu stared intently at Qin Sang, the joy in his voice diminishing.  “It’s the demonic fire cultivated by the Nine Nether Sect, mimicking the Sacred Fire.  I knew the Sacred Fire couldn’t possibly be here!”</p><p>Ye Lao Mo’s control over the Soul Infant Formation was inferior to Yu Gu's.  He diverted some of his attention, sensed Qin Sang's location, and guessed that the natal demonic fire Yu Gu spoke of was the fire from Qin Sang's demonic banner.</p><p>“So that’s its origin! No wonder its power is so astonishing.  I heard the demonic banner was crafted by Kui Yin Lao Gui. I wonder where this old devil obtained it…”</p><p>Ye Lao Mo dismissed the thought and listened to Yu Gu.  “Although not the Sacred Fire, its power is still formidable. Excellent! Excellent! I will take this demonic fire.  I won’t need to exhaust myself searching for other protective measures for the time being, and can focus on restoring my strength.”</p><p>Yu Gu, rubbing his hands together eagerly, eyes ablaze with soul fire, looked ready for action.</p><p>Hearing this, Ye Lao Mo frowned deeply.</p><p>“You want to seize his demonic banner?  Do you know my Blood Demon Avatar fell at this person’s hands? He suddenly has a Yuan Ying puppet; who knows what other tricks he possesses? Moreover, he's surrounded by Yuan Ying cultivators—not someone to be trifled with. The altar is about to be unsealed, and you haven't recovered yet. I advise you not to create unnecessary problems and ruin everything…”</p><p>Before he finished, Yu Gu dismissively waved his hand.</p><p>“Who says I want to seize his banner? I intend to directly absorb the demonic fire! Although I am not a descendant of the Nine Nether Clan, and cannot directly seize it, a mere early Yuan Ying cultivator cannot possibly subdue the Nine Nether demonic fire. He merely uses the banner to indirectly wield its power.  With a few simple techniques, I can make it my own!”</p><p>Yu Gu spoke with absolute confidence, completely disregarding Qin Sang.</p><p>He shifted his gaze to the ghostly apparitions, pondered for a moment, extended his hand, and scooped them up.</p><p>Hundreds of ghosts were captured.  Ghostly energy swirled in his palm, the ghosts sinking and rising, being refined into soul energy, merging into the vortex.</p><p>Yu Gu tossed it upward. The vortex spun, independently refining the souls, devouring countless in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Gradually, a funnel the size of a palm appeared in the void, smooth and black as ink.
