<h1>Chapter 1886: A Millennium Pact</h1><p>Chapter 1886: A Millennium Pact</p><p>The power of the Demon Suppressing Stele was nearly exhausted.  Nan Gui Xianzi handed the stele to the elder and personally engaged Mo Qingzhu in battle.</p><p>The elder, carrying the stele, left through the gap created by the Heavenly Phoenix Feather.</p><p>He moved without pause, swiftly reaching the ancient temple on the cliff.</p><p>A blood-red space.</p><p>The battle continued.</p><p>The elder's successful escape alarmed the ancient demon.  Originally, the group trapped in this space were like lambs to the slaughter.  For the two demons to kill them all wouldn't have been difficult.</p><p>However, the Heavenly Phoenix Feather, and the unwavering resistance of Qingzhu and Su Nu, introduced unforeseen variables.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi's Daoist robe was torn, his hair disheveled, and his whisk in disarray.</p><p>Star sand scattered.</p><p>Thunder rumbled within the Great Shamaness. Her figure vanished, replaced by the phantom of a Spring Thunder Silkworm, seemingly merging with her soul-bound insect.</p><p>Fang Laomo's figure moved like lightning, impossible to track, yet a shrill cicada-like sound, piercing and maddening, filled the air, causing dizziness and nausea.</p><p>Tangible sound waves dispersed demonic energy, sharp as blades, besieging Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>Nan Gui Xianzi had forcibly boosted her cultivation using a secret technique; after sending away the Demon Suppressing Stele, her strength was slightly inferior to the other three.</p><p>She summoned her treasure, a refined and elegant sword.</p><p>Sword energy surrounded her as she deployed various sword techniques, focusing primarily on defense, coordinating with Ling Zhuzi and the others to avoid being defeated individually.</p><p>The four surrounded Mo Qingzhu, unleashing diverse radiant lights and intricate Daoist techniques, each with extraordinary power and spectacle.</p><p>Facing the four Grand Cultivators, Mo Qingzhu held his own, eventually forcing the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle to join the fray.</p><p>If Qingzhu's true soul hadn't been constantly resisting, they would have likely been defeated, and the elder wouldn't have escaped so easily.</p><p>Qingzhu's perseverance was unimaginable. He never gave up, each time affecting Mo Qingzhu.  The four Grand Cultivators, with their sharp eyes, seized every opportunity to gain ground.</p><p>The Demon Lord manipulated the ghost markings with the Ghost Seal to restrain the ancient demon's soul fragment.</p><p>The Ghost Seal now bore no resemblance to its former self; it looked like a seal of ten thousand ghosts, its influence over the ancient demon's soul fragment growing stronger.</p><p>The situation seemed to be improving.  They even secretly discussed finding an opportunity to combine their strength to eliminate the ancient demon's soul fragment, then slowly deal with Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>As long as they could hold out until the elder repaired the ancient prohibition, sealed the blood coffin, and perhaps even used the sword energy to kill the ancient demon, they would be saved.</p><p>The ancient demon knew this clearly; time was running out.</p><p>At that moment, the ancient demon's soul fragment suddenly heard its master's murmuring transmission.  A glint flashed in its eyes, "You want me to merge with the demonic puppet and use the Shattering Yuan Divine Slash?"</p><p>The Shattering Yuan Divine Slash was an extremely powerful secret technique, but at a great cost.</p><p>The master needed to confront the sword energy, barely controlling the demonic puppet through demonic prohibitions.  Furthermore, the demonic puppet's original soul was restless and couldn't perform such a profound technique.</p><p>The soul fragment lacked the power.</p><p>The master had no choice but to release the demonic prohibition on Mo Qingzhu, handing him over to the soul fragment, letting it merge with Mo Qingzhu and use the Shattering Yuan Divine Slash for a swift victory.</p><p>Before the seal could be broken, eliminate all the cultivators, complete the Blood River Formation, and release the master into the world.</p><p>The ancient demon's soul fragment understood its master's intentions.</p><p>Since this soul fragment developed independent thoughts, they had become rivals. The master had always been wary of it, which is why Mo Qingzhu was always under the master's control.</p><p>The ancient demon's soul fragment naturally wouldn't completely obey its master, but circumstances forced its hand.</p><p>Firstly, its strength was far inferior to the master's controlled puppet.</p><p>Secondly, it could sense that the master was telling the truth: that sword energy was extraordinary, specifically created to kill the ancient demon.  It and its master were one body and two souls, their qi connected.</p><p>Once the sacred coffin couldn't withstand the sword energy and the master was killed, all the soul fragments would perish together.</p><p>But no one expected so many unexpected events to occur.</p><p>The Four Sacred Palaces' descendants escaped using the Heavenly Phoenix Feather.  The urgency of the situation forced the master to compromise.</p><p>This was the perfect opportunity the ancient demon's fragment had been waiting for.  "I'll do as you say, but you must promise me one thing! After I'm released, grant me my freedom, and swear that you won't hunt me for a thousand years using any means. Otherwise, whether you save me or not, I'm doomed. I'd rather consume the Nascent Soul and leave, taking my chances that the sword energy will kill me too!"</p><p>The ancient demon's fragment stated its terms directly.</p><p>The main body didn't hesitate. "A thousand years? Fine! I give you a thousand years!  No interference from either side during that time. After a thousand years, whoever controls the other will be clear."</p><p>The two demons reached an agreement.</p><p>Lingzhuzi and the others were still completely unaware of this, their minds taut, not daring to relax.</p><p>…</p><p>On Yitian Peak.</p><p>The elder had returned to the ancient temple on the cliff.</p><p>Cracks ran through the temple; it was a mess.</p><p>The elder channeled his true energy, checked the ancient prohibitions, and returned the Demon-Suppressing Stele to its place.</p><p>‘嗡!’</p><p>The Demon-Suppressing Stele hummed, and the power of the ancient prohibitions was restored.</p><p>The elder immediately rushed towards the mountain hollow. Seeing the damaged altar, he took various spiritual objects from his pouch and repaired the altar.</p><p>To fully restore the seal, Lady Li still needed to lead people to repair the entire sealing array.</p><p>However, Lady Li had been gone for a while, and it wouldn't take much longer.</p><p>Furthermore, with the Demon-Suppressing Stele returned, the power of the ancient prohibitions had greatly increased, capable of suppressing the ancient demon.</p><p>The elder glanced outward, then hurried to the other two clans' ancient prohibitions.</p><p>…</p><p>While the elder performed these actions.</p><p>The blood coffin's light dimmed, suppressed by the seal, the sword energy seizing the opportunity to advance.</p><p>Everyone rejoiced at the sight, knowing that the plan of the South-Returning Fairy had worked.</p><p>At that moment, the ancient demon's fragment, instead of anger, showed delight, suddenly laughing wildly to the heavens.</p><p>Simultaneously, Mo Qingzhu and the ancient demon's fragment abruptly changed their intentions, turning to charge at each other.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>"Stop them!"</p><p>…</p><p>Lingzhuzi and the others were caught off guard, a sense of foreboding rising in their hearts, shouting in unison. Though they didn't know the ancient demon's scheme, they knew clearly that whatever the ancient demon intended to do must be stopped.</p><p>The Demon Lord mobilized the Ghost Seal, and the other experts did their utmost to stop them.</p><p>Ignoring the Demon Lord, the ancient demon's fragment, protected by demonic energy, charged toward another battlefield.  Then, a black energy suddenly rose from its body, filled with cackling laughter, flashing into Mo Qingzhu's body.</p><p>The ancient demon's fragment left its body, ghost markings instantly covering Su Nu's entire body.</p><p>Su Nu's expression was emotionless, extremely eerie.</p><p>At this point, Su Nu had truly become the Demon Lord's soul slave.</p><p>However, Su Nu's own cultivation was too weak; this soul slave was of little use to the Demon Lord, and couldn't be used to restrain the ancient demon's fragment, meaning the Demon Lord had lost its greatest asset.</p><p>The ancient demon's fragment and Mo Qingzhu merged.</p><p>Chaos erupted within Qingzhu's body; their facial expression was contorted.</p><p>Pain, madness, bloodlust, killing intent…</p><p>Qingzhu, at this moment, completely lacked the refined appearance they'd shown before, transformed into a true demon.</p><p>The main body released the demonic prohibition, and the ancient demon's fragment instantly took control.</p><p>The cackling laughter grew louder, more and more piercing. The demonic energy swirling around Qingzhu's body suddenly retracted, completely returning within.</p>
