<h1>Chapter 1849: First Encounter</h1><p>“So, it’s here.”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the boundless blue sea of light before him, lost in thought.  He was very familiar with this luminous expanse; upon his first entry into the Realm of Governance,  Yuhuang Zhenren had described the peculiar nature of this blue sea of light.  Vast and limitless, it dwarfed countless illusions Qin Sang had encountered during his many years in the Realm of Governance.  A bizarre spectacle of gold and blue light intertwined before him: brilliant blue below, gold above, like a tempestuous ocean beneath a golden sky.</p><p>It was clear that the golden light, emanating from the Yuantou Grand Array (and unrelated to the Vajra Bodhi Tree), was gradually receding. The blue light at the sea's bottom was pure, unblemished, devoid of golden flames or tree shadows.  Previously, when the tree's shadow had been visible, Qin Sang hadn't observed any noticeable blue light surrounding it.  However, through deduction, he had concluded that the Vajra Bodhi Tree was hidden deep within this blue sea of light.</p><p>Though the shadow had vanished, the waves remained. With sufficient speed, there was still hope of finding the treasure. Qin Sang recalled Yuhuang Zhenren's account: she and several fellow cultivators had once explored the Realm of Governance, approaching the blue sea of light only to be repelled by an inexplicable danger.  The blue sea's location wasn't particularly deep within the Realm, yet its strangeness surpassed even some of the deepest illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously sensed the sea's unusual nature and felt a degree of apprehension. Since it lay outside his intended exploration path, and considering its vastness, a thorough search would consume too much time and energy. He had therefore only entered once, lingering on the periphery before leaving it undisturbed. He never suspected such a treasure was hidden within.  Regret now was futile. Qin Sang surveyed the restless shore, where blue and gold light collided, creating breathtaking scenes.  Finding no one on the surface, he shifted his gaze to the south shore of the blue sea, towards the area of the jungle domain.</p><p>The coastline was extensive, and his current position was quite far from the jungle domain. However, he was intimately familiar with the surrounding terrain; should any unforeseen event occur, he could rapidly find the quickest route back to the jungle domain from any point along the blue sea.</p><p>Mulling this over, Qin Sang stealthily approached the shore, silently disappearing into the sea of light. All around, a vibrant blue filled his vision; there were no solid objects. The deeper he went, the more intense the blue became – from light to dark blue, gradually darkening towards black, yet never entirely devoid of that ethereal blue hue.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>As he submerged, a look of surprise flashed across Qin Sang's eyes. He remembered his previous encounter:  the pull hadn't been immediately noticeable at the edge, but further in, a strange force began to tug him deeper, relentlessly pushing him towards the abyss. This force, unlike anything he had ever experienced, defied identification; various spells and artifacts proved unable to block it, seemingly one with the blue light itself. Though not strong, it conveyed a sense of grave danger, coupled with Yuhuang Zhenren’s warning of the sea's mind-affecting properties – a truly unnerving combination. He had ultimately decided to retreat.</p><p>Now, having ventured significantly deeper, he felt none of that force.</p><p>“Could it be due to the aftershocks of the Vajra Bodhi Tree's disturbance?  Other illusions become more dangerous after being impacted by the golden light; here, it's the opposite – it seems safer…”</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Sky-Eye Butterfly, and together they used their Sky-Eye divine ability, piercing the deep sea of light.  Before their enhanced vision, the sea throbbed violently; light surged, creating a breathtakingly fragmented beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this, then increased his speed. The sea's inherent fluctuations could mask some of his presence, and with the Sky-Eye Butterfly acting as an early warning system, there was no need for perfect concealment. His goal was clear: to reach the sea’s heart, the source of the tremors, certainly linked to the Vajra Bodhi Tree.  In fact, Qin Sang wasn't alone in this thought. For instance, the Lingyou Wang and his group had entered the sea even earlier.</p><p>The sea’s monotone blue light felt monotonous and lonely.  As Qin Sang ventured deeper, his relaxed demeanor faded; he began to feel the impact of the tremors, and realized that maintaining a foothold at the source would be no easy task.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly made a hand gesture, activating the "Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele," transforming himself into a wooden body.</p><p>The Lingmu body was acutely sensitive to the energy of the Wood Spirit.  Although the King Kong Bodhi tree was lifeless, its energy might not have leaked.  If even a trace escaped, Qin Sang could locate the tree.</p><p>He performed a secret technique. His size remained unchanged, but his appearance became more bizarre.</p><p>While flying, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He abruptly stopped, turning towards the front right.</p><p>He only saw the usual blue light.  Tianmu Butterfly, however, saw something further away—something like a bubble drifting past.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang changed course. But when he arrived and searched, he found nothing. The bubble had vanished.</p><p>He frowned in thought. It hadn't been an illusion. A bubble, about the size of a baby's fist, had drifted from the source of the vibrations.</p><p>In that fleeting glimpse, Qin Sang recalled the scene within the bubble was blurry, shrouded in mist, seeming to contain the faint image of a man-made structure, an independent space sealed within.</p><p>"The deep sea is truly wondrous..."</p><p>Unable to determine the bubble's origin, Qin Sang didn't waste time and continued onward.</p><p>…</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Wave after wave of冲击 (impact) like a tsunami struck.</p><p>The force was immense, but Qin Sang, utilizing his Lingmu body, remained steady.</p><p>He was now close to the source of the vibrations.  No matter how dangerous it was ahead, he couldn't retreat.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A blue wave of light crashed down with overwhelming force.  Qin Sang's gaze darkened; he lightly tapped his feet, his figure leaping slightly.</p><p>The wave passed just as he landed atop the crest, his Mingshan armor materializing, shimmering with light.</p><p>Though he avoided the brunt of the wave, a powerful force still struck him.</p><p>The power of the true treasure fragment infused the Mingshan armor, completely protecting Qin Sang; he remained unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed increased. He powerfully pushed off the wave's crest, leaping hundreds of meters forward.</p><p>He was like a wave-rider, constantly advancing.</p><p>Unfortunately, this didn't last. As Qin Sang drew closer, he heard rumbling thunder ahead.</p><p>After listening for a moment, an ominous feeling washed over him. His face changed drastically; he immediately cast the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.</p><p>The pure and clear treasure light shimmered in the deep sea.</p><p>Instantly, violent tremors struck, accompanied by thunderous roars, as if the world was turning upside down. Qin Sang groaned, feeling a heavy blow to his chest that sent him flying.</p><p>His blood surged.  Like a kite in a storm, he was tossed about. Before he could regain his balance, another, even stronger force struck, making the Mingshan armor creak.</p><p>The blue light sea was thrown into utter chaos.</p><p>Centered on the source Qin Sang had felt earlier, the entire light sea vibrated; the blue light seemed to shatter, the forces colliding to create even greater chaos.</p><p>This chaos erupted periodically for unknown reasons.  Qin Sang had only recently arrived and knew nothing of it.  His thoughts raced, and he quickly made a decision: he would not directly confront these forces.</p><p>He closed his eyes, protecting himself, using his spiritual perception and Tianmu divine ability to search for patterns amidst the chaos.</p><p>No matter how chaotic, he only needed to remember the source's location, allowing himself to be pulled by opposing forces, borrowing their strength to approach the source.  Initially, his progress was surprisingly fast.</p><p>However, the closer he got to the source, the more ferocious the impact became, making it exceedingly difficult for Qin Sang.  Still, he refused to be swept away, seizing any opportunity to move forward.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The Mingshan armor absorbed countless blows, its light flickering, like a lamp about to extinguish.</p><p>Finally, the tremors subsided, the impact weakening.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to breathe a sigh of relief, he sensed something and abruptly turned to his right.</p><p>The next moment, two intense gazes, like piercing swords, met his from the right.</p><p>Their eyes locked.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes stung.</p><p>The chaos hadn't subsided; he couldn't hide.  The moment he discovered the other, he too, was exposed.</p><p>"Taoist or demon?"</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind.  Tianmu Butterfly transmitted an image.</p><p>In the distance was an old man with a long beard, kind-looking, but his immense demonic aura was unconcealed.</p><p>"Demon Marquis! And a late Nascent Soul stage cultivator!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression tightened. Then he heard a booming roar.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>The long-bearded elder was the Demon Marquis who had followed Ling You Wang. He was Ling You Wang's most trusted subordinate, Ding Xiang Hou.</p><p>His title was bestowed by Ling You Wang himself, revealing the trust between them.</p><p>While Lord Lingyou is in seclusion, all matters of the Prince's Mansion may be decided by Marquis Dingxiang.</p><p>The surrounding force of impact was considerably weaker than at its peak.  With a shout, Marquis Dingxiang's long beard split in two, shooting out like two streams.</p><p>The front was beard, and the rear, two jets of white energy.</p><p>The white energy, like two probing white dragons, parted the waves, moving with incredible speed.</p><p>Marquis Dingxiang, eyes fixed on Qin Sang, charged without hesitation, his robes billowing.</p><p>Many demons followed Lord Lingyou into the blue light sea, but the ensuing chaos disrupted their formation, forcing them to scatter.</p><p>Even scattered, however, they would not stray too far apart, quickly regrouping once the chaos subsided.</p><p>There was another reason for their dispersal.  Lord Lingyou suspected the chaos was suspicious, hiding some secret, and ordered the demons to investigate separately to confirm his suspicions.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's presence, Marquis Dingxiang immediately recognized that the newcomer was not an ally.</p><p>Before entering the ritual grounds, all the demon marquises gathered together, memorizing each other's auras to avoid misunderstandings.</p><p>This person could only be a member of the Daoist sect!</p><p>Since he was an enemy, Marquis Dingxiang naturally showed no mercy. Capturing him and learning about his companions would give them a significant advantage.</p><p>Of course, Marquis Dingxiang also considered the possibility that the opponent was a Grand Master who had self-reduced their cultivation.  At worst, he could stall them long enough for Lord Lingyou, who was nearby, to arrive.</p><p>Therefore, Marquis Dingxiang acted without hesitation.</p><p>"The Divine Wood stirs hearts; someone has indeed come seeking it. Demons are nearby; I wonder if there are any Daoist masters in the vicinity," Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  He had been discovered far sooner than expected and could no longer wait for an opportunity; he had to fight head-on.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two jets of white energy pierced the air, the sound astonishing.</p><p>Qin Sang turned sideways, facing Marquis Dingxiang directly.</p><p>"It's him…"</p><p>Marquis Dingxiang was quite famous in the Gui Fang country, making his identity easily recognizable. However, this powerful demon rarely engaged in combat with others, so little was known about his abilities by outsiders.</p><p>There were even several different theories about what kind of demon beast he actually was.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Marquis Dingxiang, ignoring the two jets of white energy, only raising his right arm when they neared, forming a palm and delivering a powerful strike.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Under the blinding golden light, the two jets of white energy stiffened and exploded.</p><p>Marquis Dingxiang, rapidly approaching, his pupils constricted, his expression growing increasingly serious, his eyes filled with both confusion and surprise.</p><p>"What kind of monster is this? Is it human or demon?"</p><p>After the power of the True Treasure fragment was integrated, the Mingshan armor seemed cast from water. Marquis Dingxiang could faintly see the figure within the armor.</p><p>Upon seeing it clearly, Marquis Dingxiang's expression became even more bizarre. His own demon body was already quite unusual, but he had never seen anything more strangely formed.</p><p>Qin Sang's aura was also peculiar – pure demonic energy mixed with poison, completely lacking the bearing of a Grand Master.</p><p>For a moment, Marquis Dingxiang began to doubt his judgment.</p><p>"Could it be some Grand Master's demonic soldier?"</p><p>However, a Grand Master shouldn't be able to cultivate a demonic soldier of this level.</p><p>Marquis Dingxiang considered this the only possibility, a chilling thought.  He discreetly scanned his surroundings.</p><p>If a demonic soldier was here, the Grand Master couldn't be far behind.</p><p>However, Marquis Dingxiang showed no intention of retreating.  Seeing his white energy broken, he snorted, and an elephant trunk materialized from his nose.  With a flick of his trunk, he released two more jets of white energy.</p><p>These jets were far more powerful than before, intertwining like a dragon spear, roaring as they tore through the void and slammed into Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Marquis Dingxiang. He had been retreating since the beginning, and now retreated even further.</p><p>The white dragon spear was as fast as lightning, leaving trails of spear shadows as it approached instantly.  Anyone else would have been pierced through if they hadn't reacted swiftly.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly raised his hand to meet it, blood light flashing in his palm as a palm-sized sword materialized.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Dragon spear and blood sword clashed head-on, crimson and white light exploding violently.</p><p>Qin Sang shuddered, then turned into a streak of lightning, using the force of the dragon spear to continue his retreat, showing no interest in engaging Marquis Dingxiang.</p><p>Based on previous encounters with cultivators and demon cultivators, both sides often acted in groups.  Encountering one indicated that more demon cultivators were nearby, possibly even a hidden Grand Master from the Great Saint's Mansion.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang had the ability to kill Marquis Dingxiang, he would never entangle himself here.</p><p>Qin Sang's judgment proved correct. As he fled, he could vaguely sense a powerful aura approaching, the newcomer's presence surpassing even that of Marquis Dingxiang.</p><p>Unexpectedly met with such decisive action, Marquis Dingxiang's expression changed slightly.  He flickered, transforming directly into a jet of white energy to pursue, but found his escape technique completely outmatched.  After a short chase, he was left behind.</p><p>(End)</p>
