<h1>Chapter 632: Courage (Extra chapter for the alliance leader Daojia Taishang Wangqing!)</h1><p>Chapter 632: Courage (Extra chapter for the alliance leader Daojia Taishang Wangqing!)</p><p>Qin Sang offered the Cold Gold Sword, explaining to Ya Gu, in detail, the Winged Viper Village's intentions for selecting a sacred maiden.  He then looked into Ya Gu's eyes, waiting for her decision.</p><p>Cultivating martial arts and immortality isn't a casual affair.</p><p>Qin Sang's repayment of Ya Gu's life-saving grace could only be to give her strength, enabling her to control her own destiny, not to perpetually protect her.</p><p>His own path was uncertain, and he had many urgent matters to attend to; once he left, he might never return.</p><p>If Ya Gu lacked the courage to avenge herself against those who sought to refine her into pills, even with power, she would be a toothless tiger, only attracting misfortune.</p><p>Heaven helps those who help themselves.</p><p>If Ya Gu refused the sword, Qin Sang would find a safe place for her, ensuring she lived a life of wealth and comfort, shielding her from the treacherous world of martial arts.</p><p>Perhaps, that would be best for her.</p><p>Using people to make medicine, feeding insects and gu.</p><p>Qin Sang brutally revealed the cruelty of the immortal cultivation world, showing Ya Gu a glimpse of its harsh reality.</p><p>In this world, even if a true Witch God existed, there were no such things as Witch God messengers.  They were merely cultivators wielding immense power, using the Witch God's name to enslave others.</p><p>Ya Gu was stunned.</p><p>Years of deeply ingrained beliefs were shattered by Qin Sang, revealing the bloody truth.</p><p>Candles flickered, filling the room with a sweet fragrance.</p><p>A brazier provided gentle warmth, yet Ya Gu trembled.</p><p>Her face was pale, her lips tightly pressed.  Understanding Qin Sang's meaning from his gaze, she finally summoned the courage to raise her hands, reaching for the Cold Gold Sword.</p><p>Her hands trembled, but she grasped the hilt firmly.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, saying, "We are merely people with talent for immortal cultivation.  Outside, we are called cultivators, unrelated to any Witch God. We are not divine messengers, just mortals with powerful abilities, and we can die just like anyone else.  Considering this, do you still feel awe?  Furthermore, anyone with spiritual roots can cultivate immortality; you too can become a cultivator."</p><p>"Me?"</p><p>Ya Gu's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had discovered that Ya Gu possessed spiritual roots—four, slightly better than his but still limited; all spiritual roots are beneficial.</p><p>Without significant opportunities, her immortal path was destined to be hopeless.</p><p>However, possessing spiritual roots qualified Ya Gu to enter the immortal cultivation world, opening up a new future for her.</p><p>Her willingness to accept the flying sword showed that beneath her gentle exterior lay a resilient heart; otherwise, she wouldn't still yearn for goodness after enduring so much suffering.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to proceed with his original plan, teaching her a cultivation technique to help change her fate.</p><p>With gold, wood, water, and fire spiritual roots, she could cultivate techniques related to all four elements except earth.</p><p>Having examined the treasures of Treasure Pagoda Peak, Qin Sang knew not only many basic Qi Condensation techniques but also some legacies that directly pointed towards the Nascent Soul stage; some of them included Qi Condensation sections, allowing for consistent cultivation.</p><p>After pondering which technique to teach Ya Gu, Qin Sang suddenly recalled one that might suit her: Di Que's *All Heavens Demon Sound*.</p><p>*All Heavens Demon Sound* cultivated through sound, a unique method.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Di Que's various methods in the ancient cultivator's legacy mansion, including illusions, disguises, and sealing talismans – incredibly mysterious.</p><p>*All Heavens Demon Sound* was one of Qin Sang's preparatory techniques after forming his golden core, but he no longer needed it, having obtained Senior Qingzhu's self-created technique.</p><p>Ya Gu's voice was her greatest asset, in a way, as rare as those with single or dual spiritual roots.</p><p>Could this talent be helpful in cultivating *All Heavens Demon Sound*?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't cultivate *All Heavens Demon Sound*, so he couldn't be sure, but it was worth a try.</p><p>The path of immortal cultivation required seizing every possibility.</p><p>"Close your eyes."</p><p>Qin Sang extended a finger, touching Ya Gu's forehead, transmitting the complete *All Heavens Demon Sound* to her.</p><p>To prevent Ya Gu from being overwhelmed, the stages beyond the Foundation Establishment stage were sealed by Qin Sang's restrictions. Once Ya Gu had sufficient cultivation and a stronger divine sense, she could unlock them herself.</p><p>With a sudden influx of information into her mind, Ya Gu looked bewildered and confused. It took her a while to understand what it was, managing to vaguely memorize it for now.</p><p>"I will guide you in your cultivation.  Avenge your own wrongs."</p><p>Qin Sang said, then began to instruct Ya Gu in cultivation, also teaching her the *Classic of Tranquility*.</p><p>He had struggled alone to grasp the basics, taking a long time. With his personal guidance, Ya Gu would avoid many detours and quickly achieve tranquility.</p><p>Take a few more pills to help, and you'll soon feel the qi.</p><p>…</p><p>The Witch God Festival was approaching.</p><p>On the eve of the Witch God Festival, Yi Hui Village would hold a grand sacrificial ceremony.</p><p>The saintess would offer flowers to the sacred cave.</p><p>Sweet rain would fall from the heavens, a blessing from the Witch God.</p><p>On the surface, it was a scene of harmony, everyone hoping for the Witch God's favor, praying for the coming year.</p><p>Days before the Witch God Festival,  people from surrounding villages began arriving from the Qingyi River, gathering in Yi Hui Village.</p><p>The mountains east of Yi Hui Village were teeming with people, mostly young men and women, everywhere adorned with flower garlands.</p><p>As darkness fell and the moon shone brightly,</p><p>bonfires blazed on the mountains. Men and women sang and danced, praising the Witch God, their laughter filling the air.</p><p>By the lake where Yi Hui Village was located, a tall altar was built of animal bones, the bone spurs exposed, adorned with various ferocious animal skulls and twisted patterns drawn in blood.</p><p>The altar was filled with torches and offerings. Yi Hui Village guards, adorned with ribbons and carrying large drums, formed a formation.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The first drum beat sounded. The dancing men and women quieted, kneeling devoutly before the altar.</p><p>At this moment, a beautiful woman emerged from Yi Hui Village, ascending the altar step by step.</p><p>This woman was also the village priestess. She wore a magnificent robe woven from various bird feathers, her face adorned with intricate tattoos.</p><p>Standing on the tall altar, the priestess looked up at the stars, her eyes filled with a hypnotic glow, as if praying to the spirits, muttering to herself.</p><p>Suddenly, the priestess raised her arms high, facing the moon, as if holding a silver disc.</p><p>Then, she slammed her hands down!</p><p>Below the altar, the guards, who had already raised their drumsticks, struck the drums with all their might at that instant.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The resounding, unified drumbeats were exhilarating, shaking the mountains and rivers.</p><p>In time with the drums, the priestess danced on the high platform, her movements graceful yet powerful, a strange beauty accompanying the rhythm.</p><p>Gradually, her movements became faster and faster, almost impossible to follow, like a snake in a frenzied dance.</p><p>Qin Sang, watching from the shadows, was surprised by the priestess's dance.</p><p>It was a very ancient shamanistic dance.</p><p>As the priestess danced, Qin Sang sensed a strange power emanating from her, a power that seemed to originate from her tattoos.</p>
