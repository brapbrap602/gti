<h1>Chapter 608: A Broken Promise</h1><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand the restrictions on the door, but through the beast soul, he could vaguely sense the changes happening inside.</p><p>This beast soul seemed to be specially refined to break the restrictions on the Black Tower's doors.  A perfect countermeasure, as soon as it entered the earthen wall, it caused violent fluctuations.</p><p>The beast soul roared, disrupting the restrictions.</p><p>Suddenly, countless black vapors emerged from the earthen wall, like chains, intertwining in every possible way.</p><p>After the black vapors materialized, Duke Dongyang and Chen Yan attacked. The Vajra Ring and the phoenix-shaped sword cut through layers of black chains, gradually revealing a door beneath the black vapors.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators joined forces to break the restriction, yet it seemed incredibly strenuous.</p><p>As the beast soul's roar grew weaker, severing each strand of black vapor consumed a tremendous amount of their energy.</p><p>Finally, the last strand of black vapor shattered, and the door was fully revealed.</p><p>The scene behind the door was once again unexpected.</p><p>It wasn't the vast expanse like the seven levels below.</p><p>The ground was very flat, paved with tiles. This seemed to be the true interior of the Black Tower.</p><p>A faint black mist filled the surroundings, very similar to the chains on the door. It not only obscured vision but also prevented spiritual sense from extending too far.</p><p>"Wait here."</p><p>Duke Dongyang left these words and walked with Chen Yan into the depths of the black mist.</p><p>Qiu Mubai's condition was extremely poor. Having overexerted his potential, his breath was weak, and he was helped to sit on the ground to recover. Qin Sang and the others were in much better shape. They protected Qiu Mubai in the center, not daring to wander around.</p><p>The Black Tower was a dangerous place. The seven levels below were covered with bones. Who knew what this level held? They were very afraid of encountering something ominous.</p><p>The two walked into the depths of the black mist.</p><p>After some distance, a bronze door blocked their path.</p><p>The ancient bronze door was tightly closed, ancient and imposing.</p><p>Duke Dongyang looked expectantly at Chen Yan and asked, "Lady Chen Yan, have you sensed anything?"</p><p>His voice was very low, as if afraid to interrupt Chen Yan's train of thought.</p><p>Chen Yan stared at the ancient bronze door for a long time, then suddenly cut her wrist with the phoenix-shaped sword, splattering blood onto the bronze door.</p><p>The blood didn't drip down but wriggled on the door as if it had come alive, like bloodworms.</p><p>Chen Yan used a secret technique, forcing out more blood, forming a huge blood formation on the ancient bronze door.</p><p>The blood formation was a seamless whole, shining with a strange blood-red light.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a blood-colored halo emerged from the depths of the ancient door and merged with the blood formation.</p><p>Seeing this, Chen Yan and Duke Dongyang's eyes both lit up.</p><p>"Your master truly has remarkable methods!"</p><p>Duke Dongyang praised, "Worthy of a great cultivator from a top-tier power.  The bronze door that no one in Xiaohanyu could open was opened by him alone. The measures he left behind are still effective after two hundred years! I was originally skeptical..."</p><p>The blood-red light grew brighter, dyeing the surrounding black mist blood-red.</p><p>When it reached its peak intensity, the ancient bronze door suddenly trembled and slowly opened.</p><p>'Creak...'</p><p>The giant door scraped against the ground, emitting an unpleasant sound.</p><p>The sound echoed throughout the space, clearly heard by Qin Sang and the others waiting at the entrance.</p><p>Hearing this sound, Qin Sang suddenly felt a strange, fleeting unease.</p><p>Perhaps this place was too eerie, everything unknown, making it difficult to feel at peace.</p><p>Looking at the others, they also seemed preoccupied, hoping to leave this place quickly.</p><p>In front of the ancient bronze door, the two observed for a moment. Seeing nothing unusual behind the door, they eagerly walked in.</p><p>Behind the bronze door was a bronze hall, a seamless whole.</p><p>The hall was covered in a layer of mottled green rust. This hall had weathered countless ages, yet it still hadn't succumbed to time.</p><p>The hall was vast. In the center stood a tall altar.  On the altar was a light barrier, still shining!</p><p>Surprisingly, the hall was filled with blood threads, like countless blood-red spiderwebs, covering the entire bronze hall.</p><p>Even the tall altar in the center was no exception, its light barrier covered with blood threads.</p><p>Upon entering the hall, Chen Yan's gaze was drawn to the altar and the light barrier, and she involuntarily walked towards it.</p><p>At the center of the altar was a large hole emitting black vapor, bottomless.</p><p>The black vapor was like demonic energy, seemingly able to devour one's mind. It was a demonic hole!</p><p>The light barrier covered the hole, firmly sealing the black vapor inside.</p><p>Chen Yan looked down at the demonic hole, her expression complex, a mixture of excitement and worry.</p><p>She slowly raised her right hand. The blood threads in the bronze hall seemed to be drawn to something, retreating and converging towards Chen Yan's palm.</p><p>The blood threads gathered in her hand, forming a drop of blood.</p><p>More and more blood threads converged, making the drop of blood increasingly translucent, becoming a blood-red pearl!</p><p>Finally, all the blood threads retreated, merging into the pearl.</p><p>Chen Yan held the blood pearl, about to strike it towards the light barrier.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Duke Dongyang, who had been silently observing, suddenly stepped in front of Chen Yan. Under Chen Yan's furious gaze, he pointed at the blood pearl and said, "Lady Chen Yan, before saving your master, lend me this item to retrieve something, how about it?"</p><p>"Duke Dongyang, you're breaking your promise!"</p><p>Chen Yan was furious. Duke Dongyang had hidden his ulterior motives until this crucial moment.</p><p>Duke Dongyang shook his head, "It's not breaking my promise, just changing the process. You help me retrieve the treasure first, then save your master. Although it will consume some of the blood pearl's power, I can guarantee that once I have that item, saving your master will be as easy as turning my hand!"</p><p>With a sigh, Duke Dongyang continued, "Back then, you were sent away by your master in time and didn't see the horrors of the demonic hole. Even if your master is alive, I'm afraid he's not in a good state. What happens after the light barrier is opened is beyond our control.  Better safe than sorry.  I don't want to be forced away by the demonic hole and end up empty-handed..."</p><p>"You despicable villain! Do you think I'll still believe you?"</p><p>Chen Yan's fury soared, gritting her teeth, her sword pointed at Duke Dongyang. "If you want the blood pearl, you'll have to kill me first!"</p><p>Duke Dongyang shook his head as if helpless. "I know you have the protective treasure your master left you. Although you've only recently broken through to Nascent Soul, your strength is extraordinary. And I'm bound by the blood oath your master left me, preventing me from harming you. However..."</p><p>Duke Dongyang paused, a sneer on his face. He suddenly reached out towards the outside of the bronze hall, and the Vajra Ring flew out with a 'whoosh'.</p><p>Seeing Duke Dongyang's inexplicable action, a sense of foreboding rose in Chen Yan's heart.</p><p>Outside the bronze hall.</p><p>Qin Sang was meditating when he was suddenly enveloped by the Vajra Ring. He felt a sudden tightening sensation, and in the next moment, an immense force locked his entire body, leaving him with no power to resist. He was dragged directly into the darkness.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>Without any warning.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and the others watched in astonishment as Qin Sang disappeared into the depths of the black mist.</p><p>They had just stood up when they heard Duke Dongyang's voice transmission telling them to stay put.</p><p>They looked at each other, bewildered and uncertain, not knowing what had happened.</p><p>The most bewildered and shocked was Qin Sang.</p><p>He recognized that the treasure that bound him was Duke Dongyang's natal magic treasure, the Vajra Ring.</p><p>What exactly was happening inside? Why did his own ancestor attack him?</p>
