<h1>Chapter 1677: Pitiful! Alas!</h1><p>The Witch Clan mark burned on the back of Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>His true body, following the resonance, raced through the mountains, occasionally glancing at the sky.</p><p>Although True Person Zilei had deliberately flown away from Emperor Bestowal Mountain to distance himself from the crowd, the pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation could still be clearly felt at the mountain.</p><p>“Yin Fire…”</p><p>With the Skyeye Butterfly, the scene Qin Sang saw was clearer.</p><p>As the formless Yin Fire arose, the void near the tribulation clouds distorted. Qin Sang even had the illusion of being set ablaze, and subconsciously wanted to restrain his aura.</p><p>He wanted to stay and carefully observe True Person Zilei's tribulation, but he also knew it wasn't the right time.</p><p>Once True Person Zilei succeeded, further complications would arise.</p><p>Once the Daoist sects fully controlled the legacy realm, escape would be difficult.</p><p>Using his Skyeye divine ability, Qin Sang vaguely saw a figure in the center of the tribulation clouds. Though he couldn't clearly see True Person Zilei's expression, he could inexplicably sense a powerful confidence.</p><p>Even facing the Three Disasters, he stood tall and unyielding.</p><p>Rather than hoping for True Person Zilei's failure, it was better to find an escape route first.</p><p>The barrier was broken, and the Wind Formation was suppressed, but the wind煞 that nearly engulfed the entire mountain hadn't completely subsided. Wind gusts were everywhere. Coupled with the formations activated by the wind煞’s impact, Emperor Bestowal Mountain was still fraught with danger. To avoid them, Qin Sang took a winding path.</p><p>As he moved, the location indicated by the mark became increasingly clear.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang discovered, to his surprise, that the Nascent Soul remains seemed to be not on the mountain, but within it.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Along with deafening booms, Emperor Bestowal Mountain trembled even more violently, making one worry whether it would collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his expression grave, looking down at the rocks beneath his feet. Then, his gaze was drawn to the dramatically changing clouds.</p><p>The barrier of Emperor Bestowal Mountain was severely damaged, which was only a superficial manifestation of the seal’s instability. As time passed, the Five Elements Divine Restriction, the core of the seal, finally triggered new phenomena.</p><p>The earth shook, the mountains trembled.</p><p>The five-colored clouds surrounding Emperor Bestowal Mountain radiated a dazzling glow, echoing the tribulation clouds above for a moment, creating a strange beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find the clouds beautiful at all.</p><p>This phenomenon represented the instability of the Five Elements Divine Restriction, even mutual compression and impact. If this continued, the resulting aftershocks would be more dangerous than the restriction itself.</p><p>The changes in the seal didn't stop because of Qin Sang's will; instead, they intensified.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The clouds surged upwards, or rather, expanded outwards, destroying vast stretches of buildings in their path, leaving Emperor Bestowal Mountain in ruins.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>With a series of explosions, five-colored lights shot skyward from multiple locations on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, originating from its depths, erupting from several caves.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, finally stopping beside one of the caves.</p><p>The cave was filled with radiant light.</p><p>The dazzling light painted the cave in vibrant colors, surging outwards. Rumbling sounds could be heard from within, its depth unknown.</p><p>He could sense that the fluctuations emitted by the light shared the same source as the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Using his Skyeye divine ability, Qin Sang couldn't see the true scene within the cave, but he made a new discovery: the cave walls were inscribed with intricate runes.</p><p>The mark resonated; the Nascent Soul remains were deep within the radiant light.</p><p>Caution was paramount at times like these. Qin Sang scanned all the runes as quickly as possible, pondering for a moment. He discerned some clues. These runes formed a restriction that channeled the power of the Five Elements Divine Restriction into the mountain's depths, ultimately forming what seemed to be…</p><p>A seal!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.</p><p>Could it be that the Formless Immortal Sect had sealed the Nascent Soul Witch Clan cultivator as an enemy within Emperor Bestowal Mountain?</p><p>It could be sensed now because the seal was destabilizing, revealing a flaw.</p><p>It was impossible for the Nascent Soul Witch Clan cultivator to be alive, but Qin Sang, recalling his past experiences, the cause of the Formless Immortal Sect’s downfall, the sudden changes on the mountain, and True Person Zilei's tribulation, couldn't help but overthink.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, with added caution, Qin Sang flashed into the cave.</p><p>Upon entering, he felt resistance. He immediately activated his protective true essence barrier and slashed out with his Golden Sinking Sword, clearing a path.</p><p>The cave was far deeper than expected. The deeper he went, the more complex the restrictions on the walls became, their structure clearer, confirming his earlier judgment.</p><p>Under immense pressure, Qin Sang finally reached the bottom of the cave. As expected, he saw the convergence of the Five Elements Divine Restriction's power.</p><p>The mountain's interior was hollow. Bathed in five-colored light, Qin Sang could only see endless clouds, his perception limited.</p><p>The Sunfire Heavenly Flame, Nine Earths Geomagnetic Divine Light, Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, and two other divine restrictions Qin Sang hadn't encountered before, all converged within the mountain, forming the seal.</p><p>The size of the mountain's interior was unknown. It was like a giant disc formed by clouds, with the power of the Five Elements Divine Restriction flowing into it, constantly rotating.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet reached the seal's core. The Five Elements Divine Restriction hadn't fully merged, and the outer edge of the cloud disc was still clearly distinct, but it showed signs of fusion.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang marveled, truly wondering how the Formless Immortal Sect had managed to perfectly fuse such disparate powers.</p><p>He wasn't interested in delving deeper. Focusing on the mark, he finally sensed a precise location. The Nascent Soul remains were indeed within the cloud disc, but not at the center.</p><p>This meant the Witch Clan Nascent Soul cultivator wasn't the primary target of the seal.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a slight relief. Something had clearly gone wrong at the seal's core. Fortunately, the Nascent Soul remains weren't there, otherwise, he would have to reconsider.</p><p>However, the cloud disc wasn't easy to navigate. The power of the Five Elements Divine Restriction was at its peak here, stronger than outside.</p><p>Qin Sang locked onto the Metal Divine Restriction area, retrieving the small golden sword he had obtained earlier.</p><p>After obtaining it, he realized it functioned like a jade slip. He had managed to crack its restrictions, but events unfolded too rapidly for him to examine it closely.</p><p>The golden sword contained records of several sword formations, mostly incomplete, but their origins were clearly extraordinary.</p><p>The female cultivator was evidently very skilled in this area, using these sword formations to improve her own understanding. The most crucial one was the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation!</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally delighted to obtain this sword formation, but he didn't think it would be of much help within the Formless Immortal Sect. It was impossible to fully comprehend it in such a short time, and the range of the Five Elements Divine Restriction was limited, making it unusable.</p><p>At most, it would make his descent easier.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it became useful now.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed himself in the golden sword, the sword formation reflecting in his mind. While he couldn't directly grasp it, a basic understanding of its principles would make his next actions much easier.</p><p>When the Metal Divine Restriction area rotated over, Qin Sang leaped, and the familiar scene returned. He was surrounded by sword stars, but with a difference. It was as if the Western Seven Lunar Mansions celestial domain outside had been projected into this confined space, with denser sword stars, creating new variables. The omnipresent sharp sword intent was palpable.</p><p>His experience in breaking the formation outside was applicable here, but it would take time. Qin Sang didn't need to bother. He quickly grasped the sword formation's structure.</p><p>Traveling within the cloud disc for an unknown duration, Qin Sang finally reached the inner layer of the seal, sensing the Nascent Soul remains rotating and drifting along with the disc.</p><p>He activated his罡 Fire Barrier, forcibly advancing, finally arriving.</p><p>It was a black stone house floating within the seal.</p><p>“Strange, the innermost layer is actually a Witch Clan restriction.”</p><p>Qin Sang touched the stone house door, somewhat surprised.</p><p>…</p><p>Thunder rumbled.</p><p>The sound of thunder echoed throughout the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Countless people looked up in awe at the center of the tribulation clouds until the heavenly thunder reached its peak and began to weaken, realizing that the Three Disasters were ending!</p><p>“The figure is still there!”</p><p>“He’s passed the Three Disasters so quickly!”</p><p>“There’s still the Heart Demon Tribulation…”</p><p>The legacy realm was in an uproar.</p><p>The remaining members of the Formless Immortal Sect were the most conflicted. News came from the cultivators at the forefront that the person undergoing the tribulation was suspected to be True Person Zilei, the Palace Lord of the Eight Sceneries Palace.</p><p>Another Nascent Soul cultivator had emerged in the Daoist sects. What should they do?</p><p>They had just been immersed in the joy of opening the Formless Immortal Sect’s legacy realm, only to witness this scene, plummeting them to the depths of despair.</p><p>So far, there was no news of their own experts, including Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Panic spread amongst them.</p><p>On the other hand, the Daoist sects were elated.</p><p>In a valley between Emperor Bestowal Mountain and the Golden Phase Hall.</p><p>Only the old nun from Hidden Moon Convent and a female lay practitioner were here; the other nuns had entered the Golden Phase Hall. They looked up at the sky, a posture they had maintained for who knew how long.</p><p>Until they saw the tribulation lightning begin to fade.</p><p>The old nun's expression shifted slightly. "Liuli hasn't returned?"</p><p>The female lay practitioner said in a heavy tone, "Junior Sister Liuli is searching for the Immortal Palace passage, exploring those areas. We don't know if she's found it yet. However, Abbess, don't worry. Junior Sister Liuli became a nun later in life. Her Dao Foundation is different from ours, unrelated to the Formless Immortal Sect. The Daoist sects shouldn't target her."</p><p>She glanced towards the Golden Phase Hall. "I've already asked Junior Sister Shan to gather the other junior sisters. I didn't expect True Person Zilei to dare to break through to Nascent Soul here. If the other sects don't dare to contend with the Daoist sects, we can only withdraw with a heavy heart. I wonder how the junior sisters are doing in the Golden Phase Hall, if they've obtained the true inheritance of the Golden Phase lineage."</p><p>Such a turn of events was unforeseen by anyone.</p><p>The old nun nodded. "Let's retreat a bit further and wait for Liuli."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>…</p><p>As they spoke, the tribulation lightning rapidly weakened, and the tribulation clouds contracted, revealing a figure suspended in the air. He had indeed successfully passed the Three Disasters!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The three purple lightning bolts that formed True Person Zilei’s retinue returned to their original form and merged back into his crown.</p><p>True Person Zilei closed his eyes, sitting cross-legged in the air.</p><p>Although his aura was disordered, it was clearly stronger than before. During the Three Disasters, he had gradually approached the Heavenly Dao, with frequent flashes of inspiration, deepening his understanding of the Great Dao.</p><p>With no time to consolidate these insights, True Person Zilei braced himself for the final Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>How could he have imagined that, as his realm ascended, the Heavenly Dao’s Demonic Whispers awaited him!</p><p>Suddenly, an incredibly sharp shriek pierced True Person Zilei's primordial spirit like a sharp knife. It was as if someone was constantly screaming and roaring in his ear, along with strange murmurs. But these weren’t real sounds; they were demonic whispers, directly assaulting his mind, creating a terrifying impact.</p><p>True Person Zilei's mind reeled as if struck by a heavy hammer. Caught off guard, he spat out a mouthful of blood, staining the sky.</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>At this moment, True Person Zilei suddenly realized something.</p><p>The Immortal Palace path was severed.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators were gone.</p><p>So it was…</p><p>The Heavenly Dao's… Demonic Whispers!</p><p>True Person Zilei's face paled, but he immediately fell into a boundless illusion. The Heart Demon Tribulation had arrived!</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>A淒厲 scream suddenly echoed from the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was breaking the stone house seal, looked up.</p><p>The old nun stopped retreating.</p><p>All onlookers were stunned by the scream, staring blankly at the sky. They saw the bloodstains, the torn thunder robe, the falling crown.</p><p>And the person vomiting blood!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Eight Sceneries Palace Lantern erupted with a hundred-foot-high pillar of fire, its wick instantly burning out, expending all its power. This was no different from self-destructing a lifebound treasure.</p><p>True Person Zilei's hair and beard stood on end, covered in blood, looking like a madman. Confusion and madness mingled in his eyes, his seven emotions and six desires cycling through him, corrupted by the Heart Demon Tribulation and the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Whispers.</p><p>Before completely succumbing, a flicker of clarity forced its way into his eyes.</p><p>The moment he was struck by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Whispers, True Person Zilei understood that he couldn’t survive this tribulation.</p><p>But he couldn't just succumb like this.</p><p>There was no time for self-pity, no time to curse the heavens, no time for regret or sorrow.</p><p>He had to warn his junior brother.</p><p>He had to warn the future generations of the Daoist sects.</p><p>Don’t blindly break through and follow in his footsteps!</p><p>He didn't hesitate to destroy his lifebound treasure, using the shock of the pain to gain a single moment, just to desperately send this message out.</p><p>“Beware the Heavenly Dao…”</p><p>True Person Zilei spoke, but his voice was blocked by an invisible force, a familiar force, the… Buddhist Sect!</p><p>True Person Zilei's eyes cracked with rage!</p><p>A sigh came.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Danyu has ascended to the Upper Realm with the Immortal Palace, causing changes in the Heavenly Dao… This poor monk will give the Eight Sceneries Palace an explanation.”</p><p>The speaker was Sage Huiguang, who had just arrived, hidden within a sword formation, not revealing himself. He clasped his hands together, his expression compassionate, his eyes filled with regret.</p><p>“Gah…”</p><p>True Person Zilei wanted to say more, but the Heavenly Dao wouldn't allow it.</p><p>In his final moments, True Person Zilei saw his Junior Brother Hegao flying out of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, his face filled with anxiety, seemingly shouting — Senior Brother.</p><p>Then, his consciousness completely faded.</p><p>Everyone stared blankly at the sky, watching the Daoist True Person who commanded thunder and had overcome the Three Disasters become contorted, his expression twisted, descending into madness, sometimes screaming, sometimes laughing maniacally, sometimes roaring, his aura rapidly declining.</p><p>The same thought arose in everyone’s minds.</p><p>How could this be!</p><p>The Profound Gate was no less skilled in mental cultivation than the Buddhist Sect, and the Eight Sceneries Palace couldn’t possibly lack techniques for tempering the heart.</p><p>The Palace Lord of the Eight Sceneries Palace, the foremost seat of the Profound Gate, having a flawed Dao Heart was utterly preposterous!</p><p>But the reality before them was undeniable.</p><p>On this day, a great change occurred in the Southern Barbaric Lands. True Person Zilei perished in the Heart Demon Tribulation!</p><p>The entire legacy realm fell silent.</p><p>Sorrow, regret, terror, joy, schadenfreude, empathy…</p><p>Everyone recalled the major events that had taken place in the Middle Continent in recent years, searching for reasons here.</p><p>It was rumored that something had happened to the Nascent Soul cultivators in the Middle Continent, and now it was confirmed.</p><p>Otherwise, why would True Person Zilei be so hasty, breaking through to tribulation with an unstable mind?</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“Too hasty! Pitiful! Alas!”</p>
