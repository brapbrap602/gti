Chapter 1304: The Corpse Formation

"Huang Tian and the Sect Master of the Limitless Sect were actually bribed with the Decaying Essence Pill."

Daoist Zhenyi recalled the past. Bribing a Nascent Soul cultivator was no easy feat, as there were only a handful of things that could tempt them. Qu Huan, whom he had personally planted as a spy in the Abyss of Sin, had broken free from control after forming his Nascent Soul. If not for the chaos in the Abyss of Sin, he likely wouldn't have acted as an insider this time. After learning the truth, the fervor in everyone's eyes when looking at the Decaying Essence Pill diminished, replaced by a sense of wariness. Qin Sang's interest also waned significantly.

The consequences of consuming the Decaying Essence Pill were the decline of one's essence, energy, and spirit. The Jade Buddha could only protect the primordial spirit. Once the hidden dangers manifested, one's cultivation realm would inevitably fall, making it a loss rather than a gain. Qu Huan, however, was generous and handed the pill to Daoist Zhenyi.

Upon learning the inside story, the morale of the group soared. According to the original plan, trapping the Abyss of Sin in Yu City and maintaining a stalemate across the city was already the best outcome. But now, with a new turn of events, they were no longer satisfied with such a result. As the saying goes, "Strike while the iron is hot." The Abyss of Sin had brought this fate upon themselves.

"Fellow Daoists, you've all heard it. The Abyss of Sin is in turmoil, suffering heavy losses. This is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity. I urge you all to hold nothing back and break through the city's protective formation with all your might!" Daoist Zhenyi shouted passionately.

This time, the cultivators of the Cold Domain did not oppose. The Nether Demon Lord said, "The main army is on its way. Even if we can't break the formation, we can still pin them down, preventing them from repairing any weaknesses. However, it's said that the inner city's formation was left by the ancestors of the Abyss of Sin and has never been breached. Breaking into the inner city won't be easy. We need to plan carefully..."

As they spoke, the group worked together to break through over a dozen ancient restrictions. From outside the city's protective formation, they could see that within the Lotus Formation, one of the lotus petals was shrouded in a gray, chaotic mist, as if a storm was raging inside, with continuous rumbling sounds. Yu City trembled, and the Lotus Formation dimmed.

At that moment, Qin Sang and the others suddenly felt a tightening sensation all over their bodies. The scenery before their eyes shifted dramatically, and they were forcibly teleported elsewhere. Reinforcements had arrived, assisting the Qi-named cultivator in forcibly separating Qin Sang and the others, slowing their progress in breaking the formation.

'Whoosh!'

The Ebony Sword transformed into a streak of sword light, protecting Qin Sang. He glanced around but saw no trace of the others. It seemed he was being specifically targeted. However, Qin Sang showed no concern. Earlier, Qu Huan had already informed them of all the changes in the city's protective formation. The Abyss of Sin was merely putting up a desperate resistance.

At the same time, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Abyss of Sin entered the formation to block the invaders.

...

Blue skies and white clouds. A sea of blooming flowers, with a delicate fragrance lingering in the air. The scenery here was completely out of place with the outside world. Qin Sang knew he had fallen into a spatial pocket within the formation. After a few breaths, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly detected flaws in the illusory scenery, but Qin Sang did not act rashly.

'Hmm?'

Qin Sang seemed to sense something. His gaze sharpened, and with a tap of his foot, he soared into the air. In the next moment, the earth churned, and streams of black qi surged from the ground. Wherever the black qi touched, the flowers withered and died, and the beautiful scenery was utterly destroyed.

'Whoosh...'

The black qi surged, and a chilling wind howled, as if countless malevolent spirits were wailing. Then, withered hands clawed their way out of the ground, and one after another, corpses emerged—corpse puppets.

'Heh heh!'

These corpse puppets made incomprehensible sounds, suddenly lifting their heads. Their pitch-black ghostly eyes locked onto Qin Sang in unison, creating an eerie scene that sent chills down one's spine.

"I've long heard of Daoist Qin's unparalleled divine abilities. Today, I finally have the chance to witness them firsthand."

All the corpse puppets spoke in unison, their voices identical, clearly indicating that someone was controlling them from behind.

"A Corpse Formation?"

Qin Sang immediately thought of someone. "Are you the infamous Judge?"

During his search for the Heavenly Corpse Sect and Tan Hao, Qin Sang had thoroughly investigated the Abyss of Sin's cultivators who practiced corpse and ghost techniques. He knew of a demonic cultivator known as the "Judge," who was skilled in the art of refining corpse puppets. However, his methods differed from those of the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Instead of focusing on strengthening a single corpse puppet, he used them to form a Corpse Formation, which was quite unique.

It was said that as long as he was within the Corpse Formation, the Judge was invincible, making him a formidable opponent. Qin桑仔细观察，果然发现每一具炼尸之间气机相连，暗合某种阵势。

"不敢当！这点儿虚名，恐怕入不了秦道友的法眼……"

The corpse puppets laughed maniacally. Qin桑的视线从一具具炼尸身上扫过，竟然看不出判官本体藏在哪里。或许，每一具炼尸都是本体。

"不用找了，这些都不是他的真身，他是用寄魂之术，将神魂寄生在炼尸身上，可以在尸阵内随意转换，从外表不可能看出主魂寄生在哪个炼尸身上。你的天目神通正好被克制，显然是故意派他来拦你。"

Bai secretly transmitted his voice. As a corpse puppet himself, he could see the intricacies of the Corpse Formation.

"白兄能不能找到他的主魂？"

Qin桑神色不变，暗中和白交流。

"看清尸阵的变化，应该能找出端倪，你先和他纠缠，我会伺机出手，"白回道。

Qin桑目光一闪，不再和对手废话，抬手一指。

乌木剑呼啸而去。

霎时间，剑光如雨，覆盖尸阵，演化七魄杀阵。

炼尸的笑声戛然而止，继而发出刺耳的尖啸，所有炼尸齐动，化作一道道黑影。

看起来这些炼尸的行动没有规律，但随着它们的动作，速度越来越快，最终融为一体，尸气冲天，尸阵的威力彻底显现出来。

Qin桑试图用七魄杀阵影响神魂的能力，揪出判官主魂，但效果并不好，他的主魂果然可以随意移动。

见到此景，Qin桑索性改变阵势。

霎时间，剑阵肃杀，剑光森然，尽显杀伐之意！

'嗖！'

两阵交锋，Qin桑更胜一筹，捕捉到尸阵一处破绽，万千剑光齐齐斩向一具炼尸。

判官警觉。

尸阵之中，其他炼尸纷纷掐起古怪的印诀，凌空打向那具炼尸，尸阵之力汇聚而来，炼尸气息暴涨，全身凭空覆盖一层尸气组成的黑色铠甲。

'轰！'

但判官的动作还是慢了一分，炼尸身上铠甲刚凝聚，剑光便至，铠甲应声碎裂，炼尸本体也被剑阵绞杀。

'砰！'

炼尸仰天栽倒，全身碎裂成无数块。

不料，下一刻又有一具新的炼尸从地下爬了出来，尸阵依旧完好。

Qin桑一怔，毫不迟疑，御剑急攻。

随着时间推移，一具具炼尸被剑阵绞杀，但尸阵始终没有崩溃，判官的炼尸源源不断，每损失一具，立刻召唤新的补充进来。

三域大战持续这么久，最不缺的就是尸体，也不知道判官究竟炼制了多少炼尸，仿佛无穷无尽。
