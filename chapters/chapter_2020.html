<h1>Chapter 2011: Seeking Manpower</h1><p>The Fourteen Sword Pavilions of the Purple Star Palace. Five have been discovered in the Storm Realm, and whether there are others undiscovered remains unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be certain whether the sword pavilion fragments found within the Abundant Jade Gate originated from other pavilions or were remnants torn from the five known pavilions during their ascension.</p><p>He only hoped it wasn't from the unnamed pavilion in the Western Lands.</p><p>Within the sword pavilions lay countless treasures, especially within the Purple Star Palace, the Daoist abode of the Purple Star Sword Sovereign. When the true form of the Immortal Palace was revealed during its ascension, it left an indelible impression on all cultivators, a memory Qin Sang vividly recalled.</p><p>The countless explorations of the Small Cold Domain, the searches conducted by generations of cultivators, had unearthed treasures that amounted to no more than a scratch on the surface of the Purple Star Palace.</p><p>If one could claim the true Purple Star Palace, or even any other sword pavilion, the treasures within would represent an unimaginable fortune, forever relieving Qin Sang from concerns about cultivation resources.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang knew these treasures were likely beyond his reach.  Countless powerful figures were secretly observing the area. The emergence of any sword pavilion would draw them in, and any one of them could crush him with a single finger. There was no chance for him to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>For the Earth Slaughter Sword and its cultivation technique, sacrifices had to be made. The First Sword Attendant and Celestial Being Tian Yue had clearly decided to abandon the Purple Star Palace, creating an opportunity for him to retrieve the Earth Slaughter Sword fragment.  Along with it, the wealth accumulated by the Purple Star lineage over countless years would be given away.</p><p>It was easy to imagine that a feast to divide the spoils of the Purple Star Palace would soon take place at the Abundant Jade Gate. Qin Sang could only lament his inability to participate.  Simply surviving would be fortunate; how could he dare covet more?</p><p>"All those familiar with the Abundant Jade Gate have been hired.  Is there truly no one left in the city who could serve as a guide?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, and Steward Ruan trembled slightly. He had already discerned that this Elder Qin was not someone to be trifled with.</p><p>"It's not that there's absolutely no one left. There are those who demand exorbitant prices, and those who have just returned from the Abundant Jade Gate and haven't yet been hired.  In addition, there are some established powerhouses in the city, more familiar with the Abundant Jade Gate than anyone else. But some are reclusive, while others are accustomed to working alone and refuse to be employed. They are difficult to persuade... How many people does Elder Qin intend to hire?" Steward Ruan cautiously inquired.</p><p>"I not only require guides, but also manpower to help me search for the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine.  Naturally, the more the better," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>He was calculating how to familiarize himself with the environment within the Abundant Jade Gate before Celestial Being Tian Yue made his move, planning several escape routes.</p><p>Furthermore, he had considered the worst-case scenario and was prepared to explore the depths of the Abundant Jade Gate personally.  If he were unfortunately targeted by a powerful figure, escaping the Abundant Jade Gate would be futile.  He might have to desperately flee into its deepest reaches, using the chaos to conceal himself.</p><p>With his life on the line, Qin Sang didn't dare fully trust information purchased from outside, even from the Five Elements Alliance.  He needed to verify it personally.</p><p>Alone and vulnerable, he planned to bring a sizable group into the gate, dispersing them under the pretense of searching for the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine, allowing them to scout the terrain for him and draw an internal 'geomantic map.'</p><p>This request made Steward Ruan even more troubled.</p><p>"Forget it. How many of these established powerhouses are there? Give me a list, and I'll personally extend the invitations. Also, utilize the Alliance's connections and keep an eye out for me. Intercept anyone returning to the city before they're hired by others. And ask our own people in the Alliance who wants to go into the Abundant Jade Gate. I'll pay them all," Qin Sang said thoughtfully.</p><p>"This subordinate obeys!"</p><p>Steward Ruan bowed and retreated, immediately making arrangements according to Qin Sang's instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang soon received a list of individuals and factions.</p><p>These were established powerhouses who had risen to prominence in Jade Gate Pass. It was suspected they had obtained great benefits within the Abundant Jade Gate, thus changing their destinies. Some were elusive, while others had openly established their Daoist abodes within Jade Gate Pass. Several names were specifically marked as possibly being in secluded cultivation within their abodes at the moment.</p><p>As for the factions, they included sects, aristocratic families, and various other organizations, undoubtedly the local power brokers of Jade Gate Pass.  No one surpassed them in familiarity with the Abundant Jade Gate.</p><p>"Joining a faction's expedition wouldn't be bad..." Qin Sang mused.</p><p>As an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, he still held considerable value. If he requested assistance in his search, they likely wouldn't refuse. The Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine was merely a pretext. Even if it were truly found, he didn't mind if they took it. His goal was solely to familiarize himself with the Abundant Jade Gate.</p><p>However, relying on their power meant being subordinate to them.  And he couldn't join a team that was too powerful, lest he lose control of his own actions.</p><p>It was a pity that he had so few usable people under his command!</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang left the Five Elements Alliance and headed north towards the edge of Jade Gate Pass.</p><p>The city walls of Jade Gate Pass weren't aligned perfectly north and south.  The entire immortal city was slanted. Jade Gate Pass formed a point in Dui Prefecture. Traveling west or north would lead out of Dui Prefecture's territory. The Abundant Jade Gate was located northwest of Jade Gate Pass, and the wind and sand constantly encroached from the northwest, only to be blocked by the immortal city.</p><p>Within the city, one could look up and witness the fantastical sight of the raging sand colliding with the city's grand formation.</p><p>Not far along, the air grew humid, and a lake appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>The water was shallow and clear, dotted with lotuses and their large, plate-like leaves.</p><p>A large area by the lake remained empty, untouched by anyone. A hazy mist hung over the lake, obscuring the opposite shore, lending it an air of mystery.  This was partly due to the protective formation, and partly because the lake was where the Azure Lotus Lake Sect resided.</p><p>The Azure Lotus Lake Sect was a relatively well-known sect in Jade Gate Pass, led by an established powerhouse in the Soul Formation realm.</p><p>The lotuses in the lake weren't the Sunny King Lotuses of Lotus City, but they shared similar characteristics, suggesting they were a specifically sought-after variant by the Azure Lotus Lake Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his flight and walked towards a wooden bridge by the lake. One end of the bridge rested on the shore, while the other connected to a lotus leaf, forming the only path to the lake's center.</p><p>Just as he approached, he heard a splash. A lotus leaf flipped over, revealing an osprey. It landed on the bridge's railing, shook its wings, fixed its round eyes on Qin Sang, opened its sharp beak, and spoke in a gentle, feminine voice, "Ahead lies the Azure Lotus Lake Sect. Honored guest, please state your name."</p><p>"I am Qin Sang, Guest Elder of the Five Elements Alliance. I have come to visit Sect Master Han.  Please inform her of my arrival."</p><p>Qin Sang presented his nameplate.</p><p>"Elder Qin, please wait a moment."</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's identity, the osprey's expression turned serious. It accepted the nameplate and immediately flew towards the center of the lake.</p><p>Shortly after, the mist over the lake parted slowly, and the lotus leaves moved on their own, forming a path leading directly to the center.  Several women adorned with lotus accessories emerged gracefully from the mist, curtseying in unison. "Elder Qin, please follow us!"</p><p>Following these women into the Azure Lotus Lake Sect, Qin Sang met a woman in azure robes in a wooden pavilion at the lake's center.</p><p>The woman possessed an elegant demeanor and exceptional beauty, undoubtedly a Soul Formation cultivator.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt a flicker of suspicion. This woman didn't match the descriptions of Sect Master Han he had encountered.</p><p>With a sudden thought, Qin Sang bowed, "You must be Sect Master Han's esteemed disciple, Fairy Ye. Congratulations on your breakthrough to the Soul Formation realm.  This is truly an auspicious sign for the Azure Lotus Lake Sect, proof that Sect Master Han has a worthy successor."</p><p>The Azure Lotus Lake Sect originally had only Sect Master Han as a Soul Formation cultivator. This Fairy Ye was her chief disciple, and even the Five Elements Alliance was unaware of her breakthrough. It must have been recent.</p><p>Fairy Ye smiled modestly. "Elder Qin flatters me.  It was merely by chance. May I ask why Elder Qin has come to visit my master?"</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang glanced around.  "Is Sect Master Han not present?  I heard that your sect is gathering people for an expedition to the Abundant Jade Gate.  I share this intention and came to discuss the possibility of joining forces, providing mutual support."</p><p>Fairy Ye sighed. "Elder Qin has arrived a step too late. My master departed a few days ago. Had you come a few days earlier, my master would have gladly accepted your company, especially that of such a powerful cultivator."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. The Azure Lotus Lake Sect's departure was so discreet that the Five Elements Alliance hadn't detected it.</p><p>"How long ago did Sect Master Han leave?  Could I still catch up if I pursue her now?"</p><p>Fairy Ye shook her head. "My master didn't inform us of her destination.  All I can offer Elder Qin is a written message. Should you encounter my master in the future, you may join forces."</p><p>The Azure Lotus Lake Sect's caution was intriguing.  Had they discovered something within the Abundant Jade Gate?</p><p>Having missed the opportunity due to a few days' delay, Qin Sang could only accept the situation. "Then I shall trouble Fairy Ye for the letter."</p><p>Taking Fairy Ye's letter, Qin Sang didn't linger.  He left the Azure Lotus Lake Sect and continued to visit his next target.</p><p>Over the following days, Qin Sang visited more than a dozen factions and cultivators, maintaining a courteous facade.  Although he hadn't secured his objective, he managed to acquire two pieces of information regarding the interior of the Abundant Jade Gate, which could be considered a small gain.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang returned empty-handed again.  Back at the Five Elements Alliance, he found Steward Ruan waiting for him.</p><p>"What is it? Have you gathered the manpower?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Reporting to Elder Qin, this subordinate has made some progress after utilizing our connections and making numerous contacts."</p><p>Steward Ruan presented an iron token with both hands. "This is a token of the Everlasting Sands Society.  They are somewhat similar to mortal gangs, an alliance formed by rogue cultivators active in Jade Gate Pass.  Of course, whether they are truly rogue cultivators remains to be seen, but they are undoubtedly courageous and possess considerable power, frequently entering and exiting the Abundant Jade Gate. They were previously hired but returned last night and haven't yet found another employer.  This subordinate intercepted them."</p><p>Having local connections was indeed advantageous, far more convenient than running around himself. Qin Sang accepted the token. "What are the Everlasting Sands Society's demands?"</p><p>"The Everlasting Sands Society boasts Soul Formation cultivators and holds some renown in Jade Gate Pass.  Their appetite is not small, and they demand a meeting with Elder Qin before agreeing to anything. However, the highest prices these days are for commissions related to finding the sword pavilions, which are also the most dangerous.  Aside from that, they shouldn't demand exorbitant prices. In addition to the Everlasting Sands Society, this subordinate has also contacted several others.  When Elder Qin has the time, this subordinate will summon them all," Steward Ruan said respectfully.</p><p>"Well done. Send word. I will meet them tonight," Qin Sang said, noticing that Steward Ruan hadn't immediately retreated. "Is there anything else?"</p><p>"Indeed, there is one other matter, also related to the Abundant Jade Gate. Our Alliance's reputation often attracts refining commissions.  Today, someone came to request the services of a master refiner to craft a treasure for them.  With Elder Qin's important matters, I shouldn't disturb you. Even with Elder Hong's absence, this subordinate could send for several Guest Elders. However, this commission is somewhat special, so I came to consult with Elder Qin first," Steward Ruan explained.</p><p>"Oh? What's so special about it? Do they require the refining to take place within the Abundant Jade Gate?" Qin Sang asked with interest.</p><p>"Elder Qin is truly perceptive. Indeed, they require a master refiner to accompany them into the Abundant Jade Gate, and the treasure must be crafted on-site. This demand is excessively stringent and entails considerable risk.  Other Guest Elders would likely refuse. But this subordinate thought, since Elder Qin is also heading to the Abundant Jade Gate, and the requester appears influential and likely commands considerable power, perhaps we could negotiate with them and utilize their manpower to assist Elder Qin in searching for the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine, saving the trouble of finding people.  I wonder if Elder Qin is interested…"</p><p>Steward Ruan, as the steward of the Jade Gate Pass branch, was a shrewd individual and had already thought things through.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was indeed a viable option. He asked, "What treasure do they want crafted, and where within the Abundant Jade Gate?"</p><p>Steward Ruan replied, "This subordinate hasn't had the opportunity to inquire in detail. The person is currently in the front hall and hasn't left yet. He calls himself Steward Luo, but possesses late-stage Soul Formation cultivation.  I shall bring him here immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  A late-stage Soul Formation cultivator serving as a steward?  Could it be someone from a prominent clan or aristocratic family?</p><p>A short while later, Steward Ruan brought in an elderly man.</p><p>"Elder Qin, this is Steward Luo."</p><p>Steward Ruan bowed respectfully, then turned to Steward Luo and instructed, "Steward Luo, this is Elder Qin, a true master refiner. You are fortunate, Steward Luo.  The turmoil caused by the Abundant Jade Gate has far-reaching consequences. Several of our Alliance's elders are elusive and increasingly difficult to contact.  It's by pure chance that Elder Qin has just arrived in Jade Gate Pass.  You must seize this opportunity."</p><p>The elderly man's hair was white, but his demeanor wasn't aged. He carried himself with composure, stepping forward and bowing with clasped hands. "This junior greets Elder Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang assessed the old man, noting the air of a prominent clan or family. He gave a faint "Hmm."  "Where is your master? Why send only a steward? There's no need to hide anything in front of me.  What exactly needs to be refined, and why must it be crafted within the Abundant Jade Gate?"</p><p>Steward Luo remained calm and collected, bowing deeply once more.  "Elder Qin, please forgive this junior's impertinence.  Could Elder Qin demonstrate his skill in the art of refining before this junior reveals the details?"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, Steward Ruan became agitated.  "Sigh! How did I just instruct you?  Elder Qin is a Guest Elder of our Alliance! How dare you question Elder Qin, question our Five Elements Alliance!"</p><p>"This junior understands his presumption, but my master gave specific instructions before my departure. This matter is of grave importance and cannot tolerate any negligence.  The Abundant Jade Gate's interior is unpredictable, and the opportunity to refine this treasure will only present itself once. If missed, it will be a cause for eternal regret, and we cannot afford to be careless... This junior can only make this bold request." Steward Luo maintained his bowed posture, refusing to yield.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, stopping Steward Ruan with a wave of his hand.  His tone was playful. "What kind of treasure offers only a single chance for refinement? You've piqued my interest. If your claims are true, then your request is understandable.  But how do you intend to verify my skills?"</p>
