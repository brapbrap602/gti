<h1>Chapter 1595: Exit</h1><p>“Supreme-grade spirit stones?  A super-grade spirit stone vein might not yield even one, and it's been ages since one's appeared in the world. I've cultivated for hundreds of years and have yet to see a supreme-grade spirit stone.”</p><p>“Some ancient immortal formations require supreme-grade spirit stones.”</p><p>“It's said they have other wondrous uses…”</p><p>……</p><p>The Daoist elder’s last words sparked a burst of discussion. Supreme-grade spirit stones were even more captivating than the Floating Light Silver.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his seat.</p><p>After Jiang You relaxed the restrictions, he also extended a wisp of divine sense to examine the Floating Light Silver.</p><p>These pieces of Floating Light Silver came from the same vein, originally one entity with interconnected spiritual energies. They could be refined into Celestial Pivot True Silver, a treasure of considerable worth.  Any Refinement Master with the resources to acquire it would surely earn a fortune.</p><p>However, both the refining of the Floating Light Silver and the subsequent crafting process would demand time and effort.</p><p>Qin Sang was uninterested.</p><p>He appeared to be examining the Floating Light Silver, but his mind was slightly tense.</p><p>From the moment he descended from the water pavilion, Qin Sang had sensed several faint gazes. Someone was observing him in secret, and it was certainly not a good thing!</p><p>These individuals were cautious, but Qin Sang's divine sense was powerful, and his spiritual perception sharp. They couldn't escape his awareness.</p><p>So far, at the Treasure Exchange, the Spirit Calming Incense he’d presented was among the most valuable treasures.</p><p>Although he’d traded the Spirit Calming Incense away,</p><p>Qin Sang had acquired the Near-Dragon Saliva, the essence condensed from Fifth Transformation spirit insects, equally a rare and precious treasure.  It was natural for it to attract covetous gazes.</p><p>The Daoist elder, the host of this Treasure Exchange, was surely prepared. Wealthy and with a mysterious background, no one would be foolish enough to target him.</p><p>Qin Sang, alone and seemingly isolated, was an easier target.</p><p>If it were just one person, Qin Sang wouldn't be afraid.  He was worried about cunning individuals forming an alliance.</p><p>The Six Provinces Hall had made it clear that they could only guarantee safety within the Treasure Exchange itself.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang rose again.</p><p>Many were already secretly observing him. His movement instantly attracted everyone’s attention, and the atmosphere in the Treasure Exchange momentarily froze.</p><p>Ignoring the others, Qin Sang turned and walked towards the exit.</p><p>Jiang You hastily called out, “Fellow Daoist, where are you going?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, turned, and said indifferently, “I have acquired what I desired and naturally wish to return to my cave dwelling to refine it and focus on cultivation. Hall Master Jiang, what do you have to say? Is this place only for entry and not exit?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Jiang You was momentarily speechless and looked towards the Daoist elder.</p><p>He was the host.</p><p>The Daoist elder pointed to the characters floating in the air, “The items I seek are not limited to these. There are treasures yet to come, more precious than these. I will present treasures of equal value, some no less valuable than the Near-Dragon Saliva. This is no exaggeration. Fellow Daoist, why not wait a while longer? Perhaps we are fated to make a few more transactions…”</p><p>Everyone, including Qin Sang, was greatly surprised.</p><p>The Daoist elder possessed quite the fortune!</p><p>Willing to trade so many rare treasures, his goals must be grand!</p><p>The astute began to analyze recent major events in the cultivation world, attempting to discern the Daoist elder's identity and purpose.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, your wealth is admirable.  Unfortunately, having already offered even my Spirit Calming Incense, I am now without possessions.  Remaining here would only increase my anxieties.”</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was clear.  The Near-Dragon Saliva was enough to occupy him for a while, so he didn't linger.</p><p>“Very well, the Treasure Exchange is nearing its end. If you wish to leave, then leave.”</p><p>The Daoist elder watched Qin Sang depart, his eyes flickering as he signaled to Jiang You to allow him passage.</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands towards Jiang You and the elder, his figure merging into the shadows of the ancient cypress trees.</p><p>Seeing this, several others also stood up.</p><p>One after another.</p><p>Some left from other directions, including the Daoist nun who obtained the Nine Refinements Soul Returning Pill, satisfied with their gains at the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>However, some intentionally or unintentionally chose the same direction as Qin Sang.</p><p>The majority remained, curious about what treasures the elder would reveal next.</p><p>Entering the cypress grove, Qin Sang sensed the fluctuations of restrictive formations. He ignored the shifting arrays, fixed on a direction, and walked straight ahead.</p><p>Soon, he felt his body lighten as he stepped out of the formation's range.</p><p>Behind him was the boundless forest.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the soft grass.  He was in a small wilderness area, with rolling hills beyond.  Unknowingly, night had fallen.</p><p>The moon was hidden, and dark clouds filled the sky, making it pitch black.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed off the ground with force, transforming into a rainbow arc as he flew away.</p><p>Not long after his departure.</p><p>Two figures emerged from the dense forest, the two armored cultivators.</p><p>“That guy’s fast!”</p><p>The grey-armored man looked out at the silent, shadowy mountains in the night, “Don't worry, Big Brother. Back at the Treasure Exchange, I used my Bloodline Divine Ability to contact Third Brother. He's already in the vicinity, setting up an interception.  Delaying him for a while shouldn't be a problem.  Sigh!  It's a pity we received the news so late. If we’d known about this Treasure Exchange earlier, we could have brought more helpers to make a big score, and sweep these naked bugs clean!”</p><p>At the request of the Daoist elder, the Six Provinces Hall had meticulously arranged restrictive formations that isolated the Treasure Exchange, preventing attendees from communicating with the outside world.</p><p>Yet they couldn't block the grey-armored man’s divine ability!</p><p>His arrogant words were astonishing.</p><p>“Fool!”</p><p>The green-armored man snorted coldly. A flash of green light crossed his face, and his armor receded, revealing the stern face of a seemingly young man in his twenties or thirties.  A sharp glint resided in his eyes, concealing a murderous intent.</p><p>“There are a few auras within; I sensed a threat.  Do not underestimate the humans!” the green-armored man warned gravely, transforming into a streak of green light as he shot through the air.</p><p>“With Big Brother here, what’s there to fear?”</p><p>The grey-armored man chuckled, quickly following.  He asked with some puzzlement, “Big Brother, since we're making a move, why not choose a fatter sheep? That guy sounds like a pauper.  The Spirit Calming Incense is no longer in his hands, and the Near-Dragon Saliva is too risky.  Wouldn’t it be better to secretly watch that old fellow and contact Black Lion and the others?  That old fellow has so many treasures; splitting them wouldn't be a loss.”</p><p>“Pauper?” The green-armored man sneered, “Two thousand three hundred years ago, two sticks of Spirit Calming Incense appeared.  Do you know who they ended up with?”</p><p>“Could it be one of our…”</p><p>The grey-armored man was quite astute and immediately realized something upon hearing those words.</p><p>The green-armored man nodded, “The Spirit Calming Incense appeared in the North Sea, near Six-Legged Old Monster's lair. Six-Legged discovered the bald donkeys from the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and thought the humans were attacking its lair, so it fought fiercely. Later, neither side could prevail, so they divided the two sticks of Spirit Calming Incense equally. Six-Legged intended to offer its share to the Holy King, but it didn't catch the Holy King’s eye. Several demon generals in the Holy King’s Palace know about this. The other stick was taken by the bald donkeys of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.  If this person were from the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, would he need to trade the Spirit Calming Incense for treasures?”</p><p>“This Spirit Calming Incense wasn't one of the two from back then. Such wondrous things aren’t commonplace!  Could it be… this person refined it himself? Humans have peculiar temperaments. They love taking apprentices, valuing their inheritance more than their lives. Big Brother, are you suspecting this person inherited the method?”</p><p>The grey-armored man excitedly thought of a possibility.</p><p>“Capture him, and we'll find out.  Back then, the Holy King himself confirmed that the Spirit Calming Incense has a certain effect even at the Nascent Soul realm,” the green-armored man's tone held both anticipation and admiration.</p><p>Admiration for the creator of the Spirit Calming Incense.</p><p>Legend had it that the creator was merely a Nascent Soul cultivator back then. To create such a divine medicine, even if it only had a slight effect on Nascent Soul cultivators, was a remarkable achievement.</p><p>It meant it could assist cultivators in overcoming the Nascent Soul tribulation!</p><p>“Good!  Him it is! Black Lion isn't on our side, and we don't know what relationship that old fellow has with the Six Provinces Hall. It certainly wouldn't be easy to succeed.”</p><p>The grey-armored man’s eyes shone, but he wasn't carried away by excitement; instead, he became more cautious.  “This person is most likely a Spirit Cultivator. Their divine abilities are the most bizarre.  What if…”</p><p>“Have you forgotten my treasure? It happens to counter Spirit Cultivators!”</p><p>The green-armored man puffed out his cheeks, expelling a mouthful of green qi that transformed into a green cloud, enveloping them both as their speed surged.</p><p>……</p><p>Qin Sang flew into the mountains and summoned his Phoenix Wings, transforming into a streak of lightning.  Not long after, he sensed something behind him. Activating his Heavenly Eye divine ability, he saw a green cloud flying towards him across the sky.</p><p>With a cold snort in his heart, Qin Sang didn't slow down, but instead increased his speed, becoming a bolt of lightning tearing through the night sky.</p><p>If the other party continued to pursue relentlessly, once they were further away from this area, he wouldn't mind teaching them a lesson!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he flew over dozens of mountain ranges.</p><p>Even in the most prosperous heartlands of the Central Plains, areas of human activity were only a small portion, with vast wildernesses devoid of human presence.</p><p>This place was no different.</p><p>Mountains rose and fell, with strange peaks standing tall.</p><p>In the night, the shadows of the peaks took on bizarre shapes, like monsters about to awaken.</p><p>Not far ahead of Qin Sang, two mountains stood close together, their protruding rocks almost touching, their outlines resembling two tigers raising their front paws.  They might as well be called Twin Tiger Mountains.</p><p>Flying closer, just as he was about to pass over the Twin Tiger Mountains, a strange glint flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, a dramatic change occurred!</p><p>A blinding white light abruptly erupted from between the Twin Tiger Mountains.</p><p>The sphere of light was brighter than the lightning in the sky, radiating intense beams in all directions, instantly illuminating the surrounding thousand-zhang radius, revealing every detail of the grass, trees, and rocks on the mountains.</p><p>Creatures, roused from their slumber by the intense light, let out panicked cries.</p><p>Within the white light was a bone.</p><p>A pearly white bone, radiating a gentle warmth, comparable to the finest jade in the world. Yet, the surface of the bone was encircled by fine, blood-red threads, adding a touch of eeriness.</p><p>The moment the white light appeared,</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The white bone vibrated, and a heart-shaking roar resounded, emanating from within the bone itself.</p><p>The roar shook the heavens, and the dark clouds dispersed.</p><p>Countless creatures in the mountains instantly perished, their souls scattered by sheer terror.</p><p>Light and shadow flickered on the surface of the white bone, and an illusory figure rushed out from within, a terrifying giant crocodile, a thousand zhang long!</p><p>The crocodile's form was illusory, but its incredibly ferocious aura was enough to intimidate anyone who saw it. It was a monstrous beast of unparalleled ferocity!</p><p>The giant crocodile swung its long tail, raised its head towards the sky, its cold, vertical pupils devoid of reason, filled only with pure killing intent, fixated on the lightning streaking across the sky.  It suddenly sprang forth.</p><p>The thousand-zhang giant crocodile possessed extraordinary agility.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>It seemed complex, but everything happened in an instant.</p><p>Almost as soon as the white light appeared, the thousand-zhang giant crocodile materialized in the void, stretching across the sky, opening its massive jaws, and unleashing an astonishing suction force.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>Maniacal laughter echoed through the mountains.</p><p>A figure emerged from the shifting shadows.</p><p>It was another armored person, clad in grey armor, distinguished by a short, thick horn protruding from his forehead.</p><p>The one-horned man flashed forward, rapidly rushing into the air, appearing behind the escaping light.  He clenched his right fist, aiming it at Qin Sang’s back, and roared.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>The armor clanged, revealing bulging muscles beneath.</p><p>The force of his fist alone conjured a vision – billowing black smoke transforming into a black dragon, lunging forward with earth-shattering power!</p><p>A trap!</p><p>The giant crocodile's speed was too fast, the trap too cunning.</p><p>Anyone else would have been swallowed by the giant crocodile by now.</p><p>Even if they reacted quickly enough to narrowly avoid the crocodile's jaws, they would be powerless against the one-horned man’s punch, meeting the same fate.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, they encountered Qin Sang.</p><p>No matter how ingenious a trap, once discovered by its prey, it would only bring about the hunter's downfall!</p><p>The one-horned man delivered his punch with absolute confidence.</p><p>The black dragon and the thousand-zhang giant crocodile faced each other in mid-air, like two monstrous beasts confronting one another, with the streak of escaping light appearing fragile and insignificant between them.</p><p>However, the scene the one-horned man envisioned did not unfold.</p><p>The escaping light, as if anticipating the attack, abruptly halted at the edge of the giant crocodile's massive maw, then, without hesitation, shot back in the opposite direction.</p><p>The giant crocodile’s mouth unleashed an immense suction force, its fluctuations forming a visible vortex in the void, rapidly spreading, yet only managing to chase after the escaping light, devouring its afterimages.</p><p>However, this merely evaded the first layer of the trap.</p><p>The fist’s force arrived immediately after.</p><p>In this moment of crisis, caught between a rock and a hard place,</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the danger behind him, yet remained unfazed.  Forming a Buddhist hand seal, his steps like blooming lotuses, he executed the Lotus Seal of the Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals. With a twist of his body, at an unbelievable angle, he brushed past the dragon head of the fist’s force, avoiding the brunt of the impact.</p><p>The residual force of the fist’s dragon form persisted.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't draw his magical treasure. He casually swung his right hand, and before the stunned gaze of the one-horned man, using only his physical strength, he shattered the dragon tail of the fist's force.</p><p>Effortlessly neutralizing the trap, Qin Sang looked coldly at the one-horned man.</p><p>Meeting Qin Sang’s icy gaze, the one-horned man was suddenly gripped by a sense of danger.  A chill shot up from the soles of his feet to the top of his head, leaving his entire body ice-cold.</p><p>The one-horned man trusted his instincts implicitly. Without hesitation, he urged the thousand-zhang giant crocodile to continue entangling Qin Sang, while he himself, abandoning any thought of further attacking, rapidly retreated.</p><p>Just as he moved, the one-horned man felt a sudden darkness before his eyes.  To his horror, sharp sword threads materialized out of thin air, surrounding him from all sides.</p><p>Long before passing over the Twin Tiger Mountains, Qin Sang had detected the ambush.</p><p>The enemy's camouflage was impeccable. The crocodile bone remained hidden, and Qin Sang's spiritual sense only reacted when he was close, but it couldn't deceive the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's vision.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, confirming that the ambusher wasn't a powerful cultivator, and played along, secretly deploying his Golden Sink Sword, preparing the sword formation, turning the tables on his would-be ambushers.</p><p>……</p><p>The sword formation filled the sky.</p><p>The one-horned man’s figure vanished abruptly, his aura sealed within the sword formation, his fate unknown.</p><p>Within the green cloud.</p><p>The green-armored man and grey-armored man, witnessing this from afar, both changed color.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The green-armored man erupted in green light, two streaks of green qi appearing on the surface of his armor, swimming around his body like fish.  His aura surged.  With a piercing sound, he transformed into a green rainbow, tearing through the air.</p><p>A mere afterimage remained in his place.</p>
