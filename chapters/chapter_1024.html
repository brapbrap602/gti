<h1>Chapter 1116: Soul Cleansing Liquid</h1><p>Lingzhuzi paused, then his tone shifted, and he warned in a deep voice, "Those who can pass the entire trial, the fastest few, will receive rewards. The rewards are generous, including not only mid-grade and above magical treasures, but also damaged ancient treasures with unique effects. However, the trial grounds are not a safe place. Countless lives have been lost within, and every time the inner hall appears, exceptionally talented juniors perish here, a cause for great regret..."</p><p>Listening to Lingzhuzi explain the trial grounds, whispers arose in the square.</p><p>The damaged ancient treasures mentioned by Lingzhuzi should be similar to the Red Cloud Shawl. Because of the damage, these ancient treasures have little power remaining, and their original grade is impossible to determine. Moreover, due to the lack of corresponding spiritual materials and knowledge of the refining methods, they are very difficult to repair.</p><p>However, the power of these damaged ancient treasures is extraordinary, and their effects are unique; they might have miraculous uses.</p><p>Listening to Lingzhuzi's explanation, Qin Sang gained some understanding of the trial grounds.</p><p>The trial grounds are not a single path, but are divided into several trials.</p><p>At the end of each trial, there is a teleportation formation.</p><p>One can choose to give up or continue to the next trial.</p><p>Those who fail to pass three trials will be sent back to the entrance of the inner hall after giving up. Only those who successfully pass three trials will be allowed to enter the inner hall.</p><p>The trial grounds, as Lingzhuzi said, were indeed left by human predecessors, containing their care for future generations, preventing them from blindly rushing to their deaths.</p><p>This also indirectly confirms how dangerous the inner hall is.</p><p>In addition, cultivators participating in the trial can only find the teleportation formation after completing each trial. Giving up midway is not allowed.</p><p>This is where the danger Lingzhuzi mentioned comes from.</p><p>The trial grounds are not static. After so many years, the complete content of the trials remains unclear, making targeted preparation difficult.</p><p>Even if one doesn't die on the spot, if one is seriously injured or trapped inside, the chances of survival are slim.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>He believed that if even he couldn't complete the trial, probably no one among the Foundation Establishment cultivators present could.</p><p>Qin Sang was very interested in the damaged ancient treasures.</p><p>But then he thought, regardless of the risks involved, if he focused on passing the trials, it would likely take a long time. If this delayed important matters, the gains wouldn't outweigh the losses.</p><p>Moreover, he didn't lack magical treasures.</p><p>He already had two top-grade magical treasures.</p><p>No matter how good the rewards in the trial grounds were, could they possibly be better than top-grade magical treasures?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, already leaning towards giving up.</p><p>He looked at Ning Wu Hui in front of him, preparing to find an opportunity to discuss it with him and ask for his opinion.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang had also been secretly searching for Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>By this time, fewer and fewer new cultivators were arriving.</p><p>To his surprise, he hadn't seen Qingzhu.</p><p>"Could Senior Qingzhu be concealing his identity?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>Ahead, Lingzhuzi finished introducing the rules of the trial grounds and, without saying more, opened the entrance.</p><p>After a moment of commotion,</p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators rushed up the steps and entered the door on the right.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Ning Wu Hui deliberately slowing down, his heart stirred, and he flashed forward.</p><p>Reaching the door, Qin Sang heard a whisper-like voice transmission, his eyes suddenly changed, then his expression returned to normal as he stepped into the light curtain.</p><p>At this moment, he had made up his mind to complete the entire trial and compete for the rewards!</p><p>The voice transmission came from Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>Among the rewards in the trial grounds, there was a most important treasure called Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>This was not a magical treasure, but a type of spiritual liquid. Consuming Soul Cleansing Liquid would greatly benefit one's divine sense and even aid in forming the Nascent Soul!</p><p>Because this item was too precious, and the quantity that appeared each time was extremely small, the competition for it was exceptionally fierce.</p><p>However, the competition for Soul Cleansing Liquid was mostly limited to the descendants of major powers and sects.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators who knew of the Soul Cleansing Liquid's existence, as well as various factions, intentionally or unintentionally, kept this matter secret. Very few outsiders knew of its existence.</p><p>Qin Sang had inquired on Tianxing Island for so long without hearing a single whisper about it.</p><p>This was the disadvantage of being a rogue cultivator.</p><p>Not only did he lack the backing of a powerful sect and elders, but he also had no access to the true secrets of the cultivation world.</p><p>If it weren't for Ning Wu Hui's reminder, he might have missed this great opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui hadn't known about it before either.</p><p>He only learned about Soul Cleansing Liquid and its amazing effects from his sect elders just before entering the Seven Kill Hall.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, if you are interested, you might as well try to compete for the Soul Cleansing Liquid. Although our time is tight, participating in the trial should still be feasible. However, the further into the trial, the more dangerous it becomes. Fellow Daoist, please be careful and don't push yourself."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui reminded.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate at all and gave a definite answer.  He was grateful to Ning Wu Hui for sharing this information.</p><p>Soul Cleansing Liquid was not an ancient treasure.</p><p>He would seize every opportunity that could help him form his Nascent Soul.</p><p>If he could return to the Small Cold Realm, the Soul Cleansing Liquid, combined with the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, would surely have an even better effect!</p><p>After a brief exchange, the two entered the barrier one after another.</p><p>After watching all the Foundation Establishment cultivators enter,</p><p>Lingzhuzi said with a smile, "These juniors have all gone in, we should set off as well. Fellow Daoists, please."</p><p>Saying so, Lingzhuzi stepped into the large door on the left.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators followed closely behind.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the hall.</p><p>An unknown space.</p><p>Auspicious clouds filled the sky, rainbows shimmered, a truly beautiful fairyland scene.</p><p>The space was completely silent.</p><p>Suddenly, four figures appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Two men and two women.</p><p>Two elderly individuals accompanied by a young boy and girl.</p><p>They passed through the auspicious clouds and flew to the deepest part of the space.</p><p>There, a massive white cloud floated motionless in mid-air. Deep within the white cloud, there seemed to be a restriction sealing something.</p><p>The old woman stepped forward, raised the cane in her hand, and chanted something.</p><p>Suddenly, a dragon's roar echoed, and the cane came alive, transforming into a lifelike golden dragon. It circled in mid-air for a while, then suddenly dived into the depths of the white cloud.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The golden dragon disappeared.</p><p>The young boy and girl looked curious.</p><p>The two elderly individuals remained expressionless, quietly watching the white cloud.</p><p>A short while later, golden light suddenly erupted from within the cloud, and a golden passage appeared before the four, leading directly into the depths of the white cloud.</p><p>Immediately, the old woman beckoned with her hand.</p><p>The golden dragon flew out of the cloud, rapidly shrinking, the runes on its surface fading, and transforming back into an ordinary cane, landing in the old woman's hand.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>The old woman tapped her cane and walked into the passage alongside the old man.</p><p>Inside the passage, everything was bathed in golden light.</p><p>The young boy and girl squinted their eyes, following closely behind the two elderly individuals, curiously observing everything.</p><p>"Did you remember the incantation I just performed?"</p><p>The old woman suddenly asked, her voice raspy.</p><p>The young boy and girl's expressions changed slightly, and they respectfully replied, "Reporting to Ancestor, we have memorized it."</p>
