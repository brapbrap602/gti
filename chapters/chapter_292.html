<h1>**Chapter 285: The Wind Is Rising**</h1><p>At this moment, the same cyan aura surrounded them from all sides. They had no idea where the exit was, so everyone focused on Yu Kong, hoping that his experience would help them quickly find a way to break the formation.</p><p>"The wind is rising."</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been observing his surroundings carefully, suddenly uttered these words.</p><p>Everyone was startled and followed Qin Sang's gaze. They saw that the cyan aura at their feet was indeed stirring.</p><p>Like a calm lake surface rippling under a gentle breeze, dark currents seemed to surge deep within the cyan aura. As the ripples spread, this change began to extend to other areas.</p><p>At this moment, everyone keenly felt delicate threads of wind brushing against their faces.</p><p>But then, the wind suddenly intensified.</p><p>In an instant, the tranquility was completely shattered.</p><p>A strong gust, a fierce gust, a storm...</p><p>The cyan aura danced in the wind, as if it were solidified wind. It condensed into wind orbs of different sizes before Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were immediately caught in the midst of countless wind orbs, truly experiencing the power of this cyan aura.</p><p>The cyan aura above them was light and ethereal, but it seemed to carry a scorching flame. The cyan aura below them surged, carrying the chill of an endless icy wind. The cyan aura in the middle was as sharp as a blade.</p><p>Everyone hurriedly activated their spiritual energy to protect their bodies and shattered the wind orbs nearby.</p><p>However, they soon found that the wind orbs in other places seemed to have eyes and were moving towards their location. As they approached, the wind orbs devoured each other, growing larger and more powerful.</p><p>Everyone could sense that shattering the wind orbs was becoming more difficult. If they continued like this and did not leave the formation soon, they would definitely be devoured by the wind orbs.</p><p>Thinking of this, everyone became extremely anxious, but they still could not find the exit.</p><p>Just then, Xiu Zhicui suddenly pointed forward and shouted excitedly, "Look there!"</p><p>The Xiu sisters had joined forces to resist the wind orbs, making things easier for them than for the others.</p><p>Everyone gazed in the direction she pointed and saw something strange. In the distant sky at the end of their vision, there was a deep wind cave standing tall. The cave was only now revealed because the cyan aura had gathered into orbs.</p><p>"That should be the exit."</p><p>Yu Kong pointed at the wind cave and gestured as if to leave. "Let's go!"</p><p>Elder Mu Teng's voice was cold. "Fellow Daoist Yu, the situation of the formation is constantly changing. Is it wise to rush over without first observing it carefully? What if this wind cave is a decoy or even a trap? Or what if we go through all the trouble to reach it, only to find that it has suddenly moved somewhere else? Wouldn't that be a waste of our effort?"</p><p>Everyone agreed with him, their faces filled with hesitation.</p><p>Seeing this, Yu Kong hurriedly explained.</p><p>"Everyone, don't worry. If someone were controlling this formation, it would indeed be as unpredictable as Fellow Daoist Mu Teng said. With our cultivation, we would definitely meet our deaths.</p><p>However, the master of the cave has passed away, and the formation is now unmanned. Moreover, it is currently at its weakest point, and its operation is sluggish. It won't exhibit such complex changes.</p><p>If the wind cave is the exit, it is impossible for it to move elsewhere in a short period. Even if the wind cave is a false exit, as long as we approach it, we should be able to quickly find the real exit.</p><p>The formation may be powerful, but after years of erosion, it is no longer a deathtrap. At least eight out of ten people who attempt to break the formation will be able to enter the cave safely. With so many of us here,</p><p>As long as we find the exit, escaping won't be difficult. If we hesitate, things will change, and it will only lead to chaos."</p><p>In the end, everyone chose to believe Yu Kong. They maintained the Primordial Return Formation and flew towards the wind cave.</p><p>Yu Kong activated a Qi Blade to clear the way. With his strong stance, he cleaved through the wind orbs blocking their path and headed directly for the wind cave. Their speed was quite fast.</p><p>As they drew closer to the wind cave, the wind orbs around them grew more numerous. Cyan aura, as solid as substance, slammed into them, colliding violently with their bodies. The power became increasingly terrifying.</p><p>Their figures trembled and struggled to move forward. At this moment, Yu Kong suddenly waved his hand, releasing the spiritual energy gathered in the formation's core. It transformed into a milky-white barrier, enveloping everyone within.</p><p>As the cyan aura struck the barrier, it created ripples, and the barrier shook violently, but it did not shatter.</p><p>With the barrier's protection, the pressure on everyone was greatly reduced, and they breathed a sigh of relief. But then they tensed up again because the fluctuations on the barrier were becoming increasingly violent, threatening to collapse.</p><p>Without Yu Kong's reminder, everyone knew what to do. They hurriedly poured all their spiritual energy into the formation's core, trying their best to maintain the barrier for as long as possible.</p><p>Without the Qi Blade to clear the way, their speed slowed down significantly. However, they were already quite close to the wind cave, and they were now certain that the wind cave was the exit.</p><p>Yu Kong did not lie to them. Before the low ebb ended, the great formation would not change much, and there was no sign of the wind cave shifting elsewhere.</p><p>Dawn was just ahead, and as long as they persisted a little longer, they could get out of the great formation!</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt that the wind group floating ahead seemed a little unusual, then he heard Yu Kong shout urgently, "Be careful!"</p><p>Before the voice fell, the huge wind force that was beating on the barrier suddenly disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, a very powerful suction force suddenly emitted from those wind groups!</p><p>This change came abruptly and without warning. The barrier was directly torn apart by the powerful suction force, and everyone was caught off guard, exposed outside.</p><p>Wu Chen, who was at the forefront, was directly **** out by a suction force, and the great formation collapsed without attacking.</p><p>Wu Chen reacted very quickly, hurriedly waving his treasure fan, and several sword lights broke through the fan, breaking free from the suction force. His body borrowed strength to penetrate a wind group, and he went straight for the wind cave without looking back.</p><p>Qin Sang had been prepared early on. Seeing this, he immediately transformed into sword light, cutting off the two suction forces that entangled him, and flying forward along the path opened up by Wu Chen.</p><p>For a while, everyone broke away from the great formation and fought separately.</p><p>At this time, Yan Wu at the edge of the Guiyuan Great Formation suddenly exclaimed, but this person reacted the slowest, and he failed to respond in time when the Guiyuan Great Formation collapsed. When he wanted to make a move, it was too late.</p><p>Unexpectedly, seven or eight wind groups came straight to him, surrounding him in a circle, and they were already close at hand, and an artifact was torn apart as soon as it was taken out.</p><p>Seeing that Yan Wu was about to be swallowed by the wind group.</p><p>At this time, everyone was doing their best to rush to the wind cave, taking care of themselves, and even if they had spare strength, they would not risk turning back to save Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't do it even more. In Xihua Town, Yan Wu provoked trouble, and Qin Sang used him to establish his prestige. After losing his face, Yan Wu hated Qin Sang.</p><p>In the past year, Yan Wu has never given Qin Sang a good face. The other people in the team could clearly see the contradiction between the two, and Qin Sang naturally would not go to a hot face with a cold butt.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that if he was caught in the suction force instead, Yan Wu would not only not save him, but he would not hesitate to make trouble for him if he had the opportunity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, seeing that Yan Wu was about to be swallowed by the wind group, Yu Kong, the strongest and closest to the wind cave, suddenly stopped, waved his palm, and a crimson chain shot out from his palm.</p><p>The chain was as flexible as a snake, and when it was played and flicked, it fell to Yan Wu's body, and then burst into a dazzling light, helping Yan Wu block several suction forces.</p><p>Chapter 285: The Winds Rise</p><p>At this moment, surrounded by the same ethereal green mist in every direction, with no discernible exit, everyone looked to Yu Kong, hoping his experience could quickly find a way to break the formation.</p><p>“The wind is picking up,” Qin Sang suddenly said, having been carefully observing their surroundings.</p><p>Everyone paused, following Qin Sang's gaze.  They saw the green mist below begin to stir.</p><p>Like a calm lake surface ruffled by a gentle breeze, ripples spread through the mist, as if currents were flowing deep within.  As the waves advanced layer by layer, this change began to spread to other areas.</p><p>At this time, everyone also keenly felt a light breeze caress their faces.</p><p>But then, the wind suddenly intensified.</p><p>In an instant, the calm was completely shattered.</p><p>A strong wind, a gale, a storm…</p><p>Caught in the wind, the green mist danced.  It became a tangible force, coalescing into swirling vortexes of varying sizes within Qin Sang's and the others' field of vision.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were immediately surrounded by countless swirling masses of mist, truly feeling its power.</p><p>The mist above seemed ethereal, yet it carried an intense heat, like blazing flames. The mist rising from below was a chilling, biting wind, while the mist around them was as sharp as blades.</p><p>Everyone hurriedly channeled their spiritual energy to protect themselves, shattering the nearest vortexes.</p><p>However, they discovered that the other vortexes seemed to have eyes, moving towards them. As they moved, they merged with each other, growing larger and their power increasing visibly.</p><p>Everyone could feel the increasing difficulty of dispersing the mist. If this continued, they would surely be consumed if they didn't escape the formation quickly.</p><p>Thinking of this, everyone became anxious, but they still couldn't find the exit.</p><p>Just then, Xiu Zhirui suddenly pointed ahead, shouting with delight,</p><p>“Look there!”</p><p>The Xiu sisters, working together to resist the encroaching mist, were less strained than the others.</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction she indicated and saw something unusual.  At the farthest point of their vision, high in the air, a dark, swirling tunnel stood amidst the roiling mist, made visible only by the coalescing vortexes.</p><p>“That should be the exit,” Yu Kong said, pointing to the swirling tunnel.  "Let's go!"</p><p>Elder Mu Teng said grimly, “Fellow Daoist Yu, rushing over without carefully observing the changes in the formation might be unwise. What if this wind tunnel is a mere illusion, a trap? Or perhaps we’ll struggle to reach it, only to have it shift elsewhere. Wouldn’t that be a waste of effort?”</p><p>Everyone agreed, their faces showing hesitation.</p><p>Seeing this, Yu Kong explained loudly,</p><p>“Don’t worry. If this formation were controlled by someone, it would indeed change unpredictably as Fellow Daoist Mu Teng suggested, and with our cultivation levels, we would certainly perish.</p><p>However, the master of this cave dwelling is deceased, and the formation is unmanned. Moreover, it is in a weakened state, its operation sluggish. It won't exhibit such complex changes.</p><p>If the tunnel is the exit, it's unlikely to move elsewhere in a short time.  Even if it's an illusion, by approaching it, we should quickly discover the true exit's location.</p><p>Although the formation is powerful, after years of wear, it's no longer an inescapable death trap.  Those who enter have at least an eighty percent chance of safely reaching the cave dwelling, especially with so many of us.</p><p>As long as we find the exit, escaping won't be difficult.  Hesitation will only lead to unforeseen complications and disrupt our focus.”</p><p>Ultimately, everyone chose to trust Yu Kong. Maintaining their Guiyuan Formation, they flew towards the tunnel.</p><p>Yu Kong summoned his Qi blades to clear the path, forcefully cleaving through the swirling vortexes blocking their way, heading straight for the tunnel at a considerable speed.</p><p>As they drew closer to the tunnel, the surrounding vortexes became denser. Waves of tangible green mist struck them, colliding with their bodies with increasing force.</p><p>Their bodies trembled as they struggled forward.  Suddenly, Yu Kong waved his hand, releasing the spiritual energy concentrated at the formation's core.  It transformed into a milky white barrier, enveloping them.</p><p>The green mist struck the barrier, causing ripples to spread across its surface. The barrier trembled violently, but it held.</p><p>Shielded by the barrier, the pressure on everyone lessened significantly.  They breathed a sigh of relief, but immediately tensed again as the barrier's fluctuations grew more violent, seeming on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Without needing Yu Kong's prompting, everyone knew what to do. They hurriedly poured their spiritual energy into the formation's core, striving to maintain the barrier for as long as possible.</p><p>Without the Qi blades clearing the path, their speed drastically decreased, but they were now close to the tunnel.  They were certain now: the tunnel was the exit.</p><p>Yu Kong hadn't lied to them. Before the low point of the formation's cycle ended, there wouldn't be any drastic changes, and the Wind Tunnel showed no signs of shifting. Dawn was within their grasp; they just needed to hold on a little longer to escape the formation!</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt something was amiss with the wind gusts swirling towards them.  Then Yu Kong's urgent shout reached his ears: "Careful!"</p><p>Before the words fully registered, the immense force battering against their protective barrier vanished abruptly.</p><p>In the next instant, an incredibly powerful suction erupted from those wind gusts!</p><p>This shift was sudden and without warning.  The barrier, ripped apart by the intense suction, offered no protection, leaving everyone exposed.</p><p>Wu Chen, at the front, was immediately pulled away by a tendril of the force, the formation crumbling around them.</p><p>Reacting swiftly, Wu Chen whipped his treasured fan. Several sword beams burst forth, severing the suction's hold. Using the momentum, he pierced through a wind gust and, without a backward glance, lunged towards the Wind Tunnel.</p><p>Prepared for such an eventuality, Qin Sang instantly transformed into a streak of sword light, slicing through two tendrils of suction that wrapped around him. He followed the path Wu Chen had forged, flying forward.</p><p>In a flash, everyone broke free from the formation, each fighting their own way through.</p><p>Just then, Yan Wu, at the edge of the formation, cried out in alarm.  He had been the slowest to react, failing to respond in time as the formation disintegrated. By the time he tried to move, it was too late.</p><p>Seven or eight wind gusts swarmed him, encircling him completely. They were already mere inches away.  He barely managed to summon a magical artifact before it was torn to shreds.</p><p>It looked as though Yan Wu was about to be swallowed whole.</p><p>At that moment, everyone was desperately trying to reach the Wind Tunnel, preoccupied with their own survival. Even if they had the strength to spare, they wouldn't risk turning back to save Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang certainly wouldn't. Back in West Desert Town, Yan Wu had provoked him, and after Qin Sang made an example of him, losing him face, Yan Wu had harbored a grudge.</p><p>For nearly a year, Yan Wu had never shown Qin Sang anything but hostility. The rest of the group could clearly see the tension between them, and Qin Sang wasn't about to extend an olive branch.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that if their positions were reversed, Yan Wu wouldn't lift a finger to help him, and would likely take advantage of his predicament.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Yan Wu was about to be consumed by the wind gusts, Yu Kong, the strongest and closest to the Wind Tunnel, stopped abruptly. With a flick of his wrist, a crimson chain shot out from his palm.</p><p>Agile as a serpent, the chain snaked towards Yan Wu, then erupted in a dazzling light, shielding him from several of the incoming forces.</p>
