<h1>Chapter 1380: The Baihua Valley Agreement</h1><p>“You are quite daring, fellow cultivator!”</p><p>Feng Shangshi exclaimed upon hearing that Qin Sang had crossed the nearby storm belt.</p><p>Qin Sang modestly replied, “I obtained a spiritual herb that quickly replenishes true essence, which emboldened me to attempt the crossing.  Managing to traverse the storm belt was purely fortunate. Looking back, my actions were rather reckless!”</p><p>Qin Sang realized the Moonlit Rhinoceros Horn was even more valuable than he’d initially estimated, especially to Yuan Ying cultivators. Golden Core cultivators were limited by their cultivation base and couldn't travel far, but Yuan Ying cultivators had far greater reach.</p><p>He didn't want to reveal the Moonlit Rhinoceros Horn, so he attributed his success to a non-existent spiritual herb.</p><p>Feng Shangshi didn't suspect anything and changed the subject, asking about Qin Sang's injuries.</p><p>“Luckily, my foundation wasn't damaged… It was you, Fellow Cultivator Feng, who startled away the Bi Fang, wasn't it?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He had already learned that the one-legged divine bird that pursued him was known as the Bi Fang, a commander of countless demonic soldiers, who held sway between the Xingsha Islands and the Xuan Yue Realm.</p><p>The little fox, known as Jiao Hu, was inseparable from the Bi Fang, cunning and deceitful, and a constant headache for Feng Shangshi.</p><p>He hadn't been able to learn the origin of the other, the frog-fish; it was likely a helper the Bi Fang had recruited from elsewhere.</p><p>Feng Shangshi smiled and nodded. “Indeed.  Fellow Cultivator Shen and I happened to be nearby and were alerted by your flight. By the way, Fellow Cultivator Shen is the Island Master of Tianwai Island. Although his cultivation base is a level lower than ours, his strength is remarkable, far surpassing those of his level.  You'll understand when you see Fellow Cultivator Shen in action.”</p><p>Tianwai Island's Island Master.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, remembering the renowned Yuan Ying cultivator who dominated Tianwai Island, a figure of great power.</p><p>Remembering Qin Sang was new to the area,</p><p>Feng Shangshi patiently introduced to Qin Sang the Island Master Shen, as well as the other two Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>The woman adorned with a phoenix crown was Madam Yue, the sect leader of the Yin Yue Sect, equally powerful and a formidable woman.</p><p>The man in black clothing called himself Laig Qu Ke, a guest elder of Fengyang Mountain.</p><p>“Demon Kings are causing havoc everywhere, and fellow cultivators are coming out of seclusion.  Has something major happened recently?” Qin Sang asked in turn.</p><p>Based on his investigations, Fengyang Mountain was gathering a large force, seemingly in response to a demonic incursion.</p><p>Feng Shangshi replied, “The demons have swallowed up most of the Xingsha Islands and are still unsatisfied, constantly restless.  For years, demons have launched several incursions, something we should be used to, but this time is different. Our connection to the Xingsha Islands was severed first; that’s why we're so cautious.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, pondering the situation.</p><p>The situation in the nearby seas had always been incredibly complex, with a bloody feud between the two races resulting in countless wars.  But this mobilization was on a different scale, suggesting this battle would be far larger than previous ones.</p><p>If a large-scale war were to break out, he’d better leave quickly and travel elsewhere.</p><p>The Xingsha Islands were out of the question for now. He’d travel south along the Xuan Yue Realm.</p><p>While Qin Sang was lost in thought, Feng Shangshi glanced at him and smiled, “Fellow Cultivator Mingyue, are you interested in showing off your skills? With your abilities, if we join forces and employ some strategy, we have a good chance of killing that Bi Fang and avenging you!”</p><p>Qin Sang sipped his tea and said curiously, “I owe both of you for helping me escape danger, and I should help in return. However, in a war between two races, my contribution as a single person would be limited. Why doesn't Fellow Cultivator Feng send out a warning to other cultivators?  Are they really leaving you to bear the burden of the two races alone?”</p><p>Wars in the cultivation world spanned far more than mere years.</p><p>As an example, the North Star Realm’s Three Regions War lasted two hundred years.</p><p>Qin Sang was traveling alone and preferred to remain unburdened, unwilling to be confined to one place fighting for others.</p><p>Feng Shangshi explained, “If it escalates to a full-scale war between the two races, other cultivators won’t stand idly by.  Before that, I need to assess the situation to avoid alerting the demons if this is just a bluff. Rest assured, Fellow Cultivator Shen and the others are trying to contact cultivators on the Xingsha Islands. Soon, we will know the demons' intentions and can make plans. In the meantime, we need to guard against demonic schemes, and I’m worried about a shortage of manpower, leaving gaps in our defenses that the demons could exploit.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked hesitant.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, he said, “Since Fellow Cultivator Feng asked, and I have nothing pressing to do, guarding a section of the front line for a while is fine. But… although I was pursued, I suffered no substantial losses. While defeating my enemy would be good, I wouldn't be too concerned if I didn’t get a chance for revenge.”</p><p>Feng Shangshi understood Qin Sang’s meaning: he would only lend a hand within the limits of his abilities.</p><p>They had all cultivated to this realm, each burdened with grudges and resentments.</p><p>If they dwelled on every single feud, their minds would have long since shattered.</p><p>Tapping his fingers on the table, Master Feng mused for a moment, then said, "I hear that Daoist Mingyue is searching for insect-controlling techniques, and is very interested in Hundred Flowers Valley's *Insect Flower Scripture*?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looking at Master Feng.</p><p>"Cultivators proficient in insect control are few and far between. Hundred Flowers Valley is the foremost in this field. If you were to study this art, and receive guidance from the Valley Master, your progress would certainly be greatly accelerated.  Unfortunately, Hundred Flowers Valley is notoriously secretive and eccentric, rarely interacting with the outside world.  For you to befriend the Valley Master would require considerable effort."</p><p>Master Feng expressed his regret, feeling sorry for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang understood his implication, "Master Feng, do you perhaps have a solution?"</p><p>Master Feng smiled, "Indeed, during my travels, I formed a slight acquaintance with the Hundred Flowers Valley Master.  If I were to act as an intermediary, as long as your request isn't unreasonable, the Valley Master should grant me some face.  If you don't believe me, I can swear on my demonic heart."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart leaped.</p><p>Regardless of whether Hundred Flowers Valley was as peculiar as Master Feng described, as a stranger, a sudden visit would make it difficult to gain their trust.</p><p>If Master Feng could be persuaded, things would be much easier.</p><p>"What if the situation becomes critical…"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could explain further, Master Feng waved his hand, "Rest assured, Daoist friend. If things become impossible, I will not risk my life!"</p><p>"Then I humbly accept your offer!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded lightly, agreeing.</p><p>Master Feng was delighted, and voluntarily swore an oath, promising to help Qin Sang with the introduction, win or lose, once the matter was concluded.</p><p>The collaboration was agreed upon in a few words.</p><p>Master Feng and Qin Sang immediately left Fengyang Mountain and flew towards the nameless island.</p><p>Upon landing, Qin Sang exchanged greetings with the other three.</p><p>The five Yuan Ying cultivators brought out a topographical map, discussed it for a while, and decided to have Qin Sang stationed at an island called Hunting Dawn Island.</p><p>Hunting Dawn Island is located northwest of Moontip, situated between several lines of defense, a rather important strategic point.</p><p>Qin Sang received a token and a communication artifact, and set off for Hunting Dawn Island.</p><p>They watched as Qin Sang's figure disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>Master Feng and the others' expressions turned serious, exchanging glances.</p><p>The female cultivator with the phoenix crown whispered, "Master Feng didn't tell him about the Xuan Tian Palace traitor?"</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Troubles always come in bunches. Even at home on the weekend, I can't rest. The next chapter will likely be as late as yesterday's. See you all tomorrow morning.</p>
