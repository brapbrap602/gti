<h1>Chapter 2239: The Azure Bird’s Divine Ability</h1><p>Star Yuan energy surged into his body.  Qin Sang was already at the bottleneck of the third level, just a step away from breakthrough, a breakthrough interrupted last time by an unforeseen event.</p><p>After circulating his cultivation once, Qin Sang immediately sensed the bottleneck loosening. This time, he didn’t hesitate, seizing the momentum to break through the barrier.</p><p>The first three levels of *Heavenly Demon Transformation* only contained one Heavenly Demon Transformation divine ability.  Upon breaking through the third level, this ability would strengthen, but Qin Sang, having already gone through this before, was intimately familiar with it.  This breakthrough didn't bring about any significant qualitative change.</p><p>He wasn't concerned with his own changes. After the breakthrough, he immediately focused his mind, reaching towards the stars.</p><p>“Come…come…come…”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, that murmuring voice appeared again.</p><p>Due to his improved cultivation, it was clearer than before. The call felt like it was directly transmitted to the deepest part of Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>It turned out that it wasn't just those two syllables. Among the previously fragmented sounds Qin Sang heard, there were other words, though too indistinct to make out.</p><p>Qin Sang concentrated, finally discerning two more words.</p><p>“Come…find me…come…find me…find me…”</p><p>Come find me!</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t sure if this was a complete sentence, or if there were other words. He could only clearly hear these four.</p><p>The other party didn't reveal their identity, nor did they tell Qin Sang why they wanted him to find them.</p><p>Could it be a cry for help?</p><p>A possibility occurred to Qin Sang. He sensed weakness and powerlessness in the voice; it sounded like someone was trapped somewhere, urgently calling out for help.</p><p>But Qin Sang also sensed a hint of enticement, subtly stirring the deepest desires within one's heart, alluring those who heard the call.</p><p>“Entrapment?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>If it was a lure, where did they want him to go, and what was their purpose? If it was high in the sky, he'd likely need to recover his cultivation before ascending.</p><p>For years, Qin Sang had often followed the Celestial Guards, wandering the lands between the two races, hoping to capture an Azure Bird and ask if any Azure Bird cultivators had encountered such a strange event.  Unfortunately, he hadn't been successful.</p><p>After long contemplation, Qin Sang finally made a decision. Following the source of the voice, he voiced his question, “Who are you?”</p><p>Since he could hear the other party, it meant a connection existed between them. They should be able to sense him.</p><p>After asking, Qin Sang received no response.</p><p>“Come…find me…come…come…”</p><p>The mysterious person in the stars relentlessly called out.</p><p>Perhaps they couldn't hear, or maybe they had lost their sanity and were relying on instinct.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly asked, to no avail.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang gave up, frowning thoughtfully.  “Could it be that my cultivation is too low?”</p><p>This was quite possible. Qin Sang only heard the call after cultivating *Heavenly Demon Transformation* to the second level. After this breakthrough, the voice became clearer, indicating that the ‘distance’ between them was gradually closing, but it clearly wasn't close enough. Qin Sang could hear them, but they couldn't hear him.</p><p>Considering this possibility, Qin Sang felt a slight disappointment, but his mind relaxed somewhat.  He no longer needed to worry about his safety and could focus on cultivating *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>However, with the cultivation speed of *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, this situation wouldn't last long.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang was about to stop cultivating when the call abruptly ceased.  Then, Qin Sang heard a sharp, piercing cry.</p><p>Qin Sang's hair stood on end instantly.</p><p>Pain, rage, hatred, killing intent…the cry was a mixture of negative emotions, far clearer than before, flooding in before abruptly stopping.</p><p>It was unimaginable what the other party had endured.</p><p>After the cry, the calls disappeared completely.  Qin Sang remained where he was, continuing his cultivation, but the calls didn't return.</p><p>The night sky returned to its tranquil state, only the starlight twinkling.</p><p>Qin Sang decided not to wait any longer. He got up, removed the spirit array, erased his tracks, and calculated the time. He had been gone too long and should return to his sect.  I wonder if Senior Brother Tong Shen has left seclusion yet; he’ll be astonished to see my current cultivation level.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang looked around, flashed into the forest, moved stealthily, and finally arrived at a cave.</p><p>Qin Sang had set up an array here. In the center of the cave stood a man-high treasure mirror reflecting a mountainous landscape.</p><p>The scene in the mirror wasn't nearby. It was projected using Qin Sang’s array, allowing him to remotely monitor the location and ensure his safety.</p><p>The place he was currently monitoring was on a frequently used path for demon cultivators.</p><p>During a patrol with the Immortal Guards, Qin Sang accidentally discovered a gathering of demonic cultivators in the north.  Investigation revealed they were excavating a hidden realm, led by a powerful phoenix.</p><p>To explore this realm, the phoenix leader kept bringing in reinforcements. Qin Sang remained, waiting for a lone Qingluan cultivator to appear.</p><p>He estimated the realm was about 80% explored, leaving him little time.</p><p>"It should be soon..."</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at his magical mirror.</p><p>Moments later, several lights appeared, rapidly approaching.</p><p>Seeing the leader, Qin Sang was delighted.  The creature was incredibly magnificent, its body a jade green, accompanied by blue lightning as it flew.  Its every glance exuded an air of supreme authority – a true Qingluan!</p><p>There are many types of phoenixes, the Qingluan being one. While revered as divine beasts in later eras, they weren't uncommon in this age.</p><p>"Finally, a Qingluan!"</p><p>Qin Sang silently left his cave.</p><p>He positioned himself ahead of them, observing their cultivation levels without making a move.</p><p>"Five demonic beasts, including the Qingluan. Three are in the Transformation stage..."</p><p>Qin Sang considered his options and decided to strike.  Having recently broken through to the Nascent Soul stage, he felt confident.</p><p>Unaware of the impending danger, the Qingluan and its companions soared through the sky, their demeanor somewhat relaxed.</p><p>"Once we deliver this array, Lord Baiyi should be able to break through the final barrier."</p><p>"Exactly, then we'll have earned merit, and Lord Baiyi won't treat us poorly.  We owe Wen for securing this opportunity."</p><p>…</p><p>The Qingluan, enjoying the compliments, smiled lightly.  Suddenly, an eerie silence fell, even the sound of its companions’ wings ceased.</p><p>The Qingluan spun around, but its companions had vanished.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew.  White clouds drifted lazily across the sky, mountains stretched below like dragons – everything seemed normal.</p><p>The disappearance of its companions in broad daylight, within a hundred yards, without its detection, sent a chill down the Qingluan’s spine. Its feathers bristled.</p><p>"Who's there?!"</p><p>"Li, Jiu, where are you?"</p><p>The Qingluan cried out, flapping its wings, generating countless threads of lightning that formed two orbs, exploding in mid-air.</p><p>It knew it was trapped in an array, but couldn't see it. This was its attempt to destroy it.</p><p>A few days prior, the Qingluan wouldn't have been so vulnerable.  But Qin Sang's improved cultivation and refined trap made it easily outmatched.</p><p>As the lightning exploded, the Qingluan's vision blurred, a gray whirlwind appearing out of nowhere, engulfing it instantly.</p><p>The hurricane howled, trapping the Qingluan.  The gray air caused a moment of disorientation, freezing the Qingluan's movements.</p><p>"Damn it, poison!"</p><p>The Qingluan violently shook its head, gulping down several pills to counter the poison.</p><p>This was just the beginning of the attack. From the moment the poison took effect, Qin Sang had complete control.</p><p>Following the poisonous smoke, powerful tearing forces emerged from the storm, the array unleashing its full power.</p><p>While battling the storm and poison, the Qingluan saw a figure emerge from the void.</p><p>"Surrender, and I'll spare your life!"</p><p>"Human scum!"</p><p>The Qingluan glared at Qin Sang, filled with rage and resentment.</p><p>The phoenixes, believing themselves imbued with five virtues and blessed by heaven, considered themselves kings of the birds. Only the dragons and a few other races could rival them. Even now, they never considered humans a threat.  To be ambushed by a human cultivator was unbearable.</p><p>The other four demonic beasts were separated by the array, its illusory nature hindering their ability to aid the Qingluan.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use any illusions, there was no need.  He revealed himself and attacked alongside the array.</p><p>Despite surpassing Qin Sang in cultivation, the Qingluan was no match.  Weakened by the ever-increasing poison, it was quickly overpowered and captured.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang swiftly sealed the Qingluan, and fled.</p><p>Shortly after, the four remaining beasts broke free from the array, only to find the Qingluan gone.</p><p>Panicked, they hastily sought help, finally alarming a powerful Phoenix clan member exploring a hidden realm.  Despite possessing the power comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator, even they couldn't find any trace of the culprit after a thorough search, leaving them frustrated and defeated.</p><p>While the demon race searched for the perpetrator, Qin Sang had already fled with Qingluan to a safe location and awakened her.</p><p>Qingluan, regaining consciousness and understanding her predicament, glared at Qin Sang with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>"Friend, if you cooperate and answer a few of my questions, you can avoid the torment of soul-searching."</p><p>Qin Sang tried to persuade her, but seeing Qingluan remain unmoved, knowing the pride of the Phoenix clan, he apologized and proceeded.</p><p>Qin Sang then performed a soul-searching technique. Fortunately, his skill was refined enough to get the answers he wanted.</p><p>"This Qingluan never heard such a sound during its cultivation…"</p><p>Searching Qingluan's memories, Qin Sang learned that the Qingluan clan indeed had powerful individuals who had achieved celestial transformation, and more than one.</p><p>Those who reached the level of ‘soul-linking-to-stars’ were called Saints, and those who advanced further were revered as Celestial Demons, equivalent to the Mahayana stage of later eras.</p><p>Whether or not the Qingluan clan had Celestial Demons, this Qingluan didn’t know. It hadn't yet qualified to interact with the clan's powerful members, much less communicate directly with them.</p><p>"If not a celestial star, who called out to it?"</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed deeper.</p><p>Qingluan's soul essence had dissipated during the soul-searching, but its body and belongings remained. Qin Sang not only made a significant gain but also had an unexpected windfall.</p><p>Several secret techniques using Qingluan's True Thunder were recorded in ancient texts—the culmination of the Qingluan clan's wisdom. Qin Sang was captivated by these techniques and couldn't resist studying them on the spot.</p><p>Some of the content aligned with his previous ideas. However, being human, he faced significant difficulties in deciphering them, as many lacked the complete sequence.  Seeing these techniques, he felt a sudden enlightenment.</p><p>One technique, the "Thousand Shadows Illusory Harmony Secret Manual," particularly enthralled him. He exclaimed that Qingluan True Thunder could actually be used in this way.</p><p>"These techniques are indeed feasible!  Regardless of other applications, the illusionary realm itself is a treasure trove. If I obtain several secret techniques from the Qingluan clan, return to the present day, and utilize Qingluan True Thunder, things will surely be much easier and more natural. It seems I'll have to contend with the Qingluan clan," Qin Sang muttered to himself, feeling renewed motivation.</p><p>Having finished his business, Qin Sang didn't linger and continued flying westward.</p><p>Over the years, Yongtu Immortal City had not only been transporting its own people, but had also established outposts in various locations outside the city, gradually creating a tight net, clearly preparing for upcoming troop deployments.</p><p>There were celestial boats traveling between the outposts and the city. Qin Sang found the nearest outpost and took a celestial boat back to the city.</p><p>Having 'traveled' to the ancient era for so long, Qin Sang hadn't yet seen the large teleportation arrays of later eras capable of traversing vast distances. Cultivators relied on self-propelled flight and flying artifacts.</p><p>Even with small teleportation arrays, their range was very limited, mostly used within cities, or in mountain gates and hidden realms.</p><p>Perhaps this is why troop deployments took a long time, and the pace of war was so slow.</p><p>Teleportation arrays and dimensional pouches are both related to spatial dao. Qin Sang suspected that something significant must have happened in later eras that led to their significant advancement.</p><p>However, even in later eras, large teleportation arrays were not easy to build.  The teleportation arrays between the eight great celestial states remain unreproducible to this day.</p><p>To facilitate Qingyang's trade, Qin Sang had considered building a teleportation array directly connecting Qingyang and Zhuyan, but was dissuaded by the Yuanxiang clan leader.  Ultimately, they decided to build one connecting nearby tribes.  To reach Zhuyan, multiple transfers would be needed.</p><p>Even so, the cost was considerable, making Qin Sang feel extremely burdened.</p><p>The large-scale, long-distance teleportation arrays Qin Sang had encountered were mostly ancient arrays left over from antiquity.</p><p>Clearly, the development of teleportation arrays went through a process of creation, prosperity, and decline.  It should have continued to improve, yet somehow declined in later eras.  This remained a mystery.</p><p>He would have to return to his own time to find the answers to these questions.</p><p>A gentle tremor from the celestial boat broke Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside, seeing that they had reached Yongtu Immortal City. He got up, disembarked, bypassed the city, and directly returned to his sect.</p><p>...</p><p>Yuanjing Mountain.</p><p>While Qin Sang was hurrying back, dark clouds gathered above Yuanjing Mountain, shooting eight beams of light down to the earth, enveloping the mountain within. This phenomenon signified the activation of the protective mountain array.</p><p>In front of Yuanjing Mountain, countless figures stood, their eyes fixed on the array, watching with hostile intent.</p>
