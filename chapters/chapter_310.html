Chapter 303: Fool (Part Three)


“Form the array!”
Cloud Traveler didn't dare to place all his hope on the Spirit Bamboo flying boat. The Birdman was a late-stage Spirit Severing demonic bird, and its speed was definitely no slower than the flying boat.  Trying to escape now would be a dead end!
Hastily prepared, he activated the Golden Ring Array. But without Shangguan Lifeng and the strongest, Luo Xingnan, only the four of them remained. The array's power was greatly diminished, and whether it could withstand the Birdman was unknown.
However, Luo Xingnan's situation wasn't good either.
The Birdman's cries and the Hook Snakes' roars seemed to harmonize, giving the impression that the demonic beasts were communicating.  The Birdman appeared to be complaining to the Hook Snakes about the cultivators stealing their medicine.
Immediately afterward, the Hook Snakes roared furiously, and the red mist spread at an alarming rate.
Luo Xingnan hadn't expected the Hook Snakes to be alerted so soon. Caught off guard, he was intercepted by the snakes and once again surrounded.
The Hook Snakes had suffered heavy losses in their previous assault on the cultivators, and not many remained combat-ready. The scene wasn't as terrifying as before. However, the two mid-stage Spirit Severing Hook Snake Kings were largely unharmed and still possessed formidable strength. The situation remained extremely dangerous.
Separated by the demonic beasts, the two groups of cultivators could only fight their own battles.
However, Qin Sang's group was in the most peril.
The moment they raised the Golden Ring Array, their vision darkened as the Birdman swooped down.  In the open terrain, the Birdman's speed and strength were fully displayed.
It was faster than the Spirit Bamboo flying boat.
Fortunately, Cloud Traveler had been prescient. Otherwise, they would have already been caught by the Birdman.  Crowded on the flying boat, they wouldn't have had time to form the array and would have been slaughtered one by one!
*Bang!*
The copper rings trembled, golden light erupted, and countless illusory rings overlapped, barely blocking the Birdman's sharp claws.
However, due to the array's weakened state, resisting the Birdman's attack was far more difficult than before.
The four felt the impact like a heavy punch. Their bodies trembled, their faces paled, and their spiritual energy was rapidly drained by the Golden Ring Array. In an instant, nearly half of their spiritual energy was consumed just to maintain the array.
But the Birdman attacked again before they could recover.
Alarmed, they hurriedly took out spirit stones and pills, desperately trying to replenish their spiritual energy.
Everyone understood that once the array was broken, they would be no match for the Birdman.
Seemingly remembering its previous entrapment, the Birdman used its speed advantage to circle them, striking and retreating quickly. Each attack was a thunderous blow.
As the main controller of the array, Cloud Traveler was under the greatest pressure and had no chance to pilot the flying boat.
The Golden Ring Array was on the verge of collapse.
They weren't far from the exit, but at this rate, the array would be torn apart before they could reach it.
In this situation, the best course of action was to put aside past grievances and cooperate with Luo Xingnan!
However, with one side pinned down by the Birdman and the other surrounded by Hook Snakes, joining forces wasn't easy.  They needed to break through.
Qin Sang's mind raced. He had the Ten Yama Banners and the Jade Ruyi Talisman. The Ten Yama Array was more powerful.
If Cloud Traveler weren't present, the others wouldn't know his true identity, so even if he exposed it, it wouldn't matter. However, these two treasures had different strengths. In this situation, the Jade Ruyi Talisman was more suitable than the Ten Yama Array.
Unexpectedly, after discussing the plan with Cloud Traveler and the others, and asking them to buy him time, just as he was about to deploy the Jade Ruyi Talisman, Ge Yuan made a surprising move.
The Birdman attacked again.
As everyone hurriedly channeled their newly recovered spiritual energy to power the Golden Ring Array, Ge Yuan suddenly flung his copper ring, silently abandoning the formation.
He'd clearly planned this beforehand. The moment he broke free, he transformed into a streak of light and fled towards the exit without looking back.
Leaving the others to die!
Everyone was furious. No one had expected Ge Yuan to do such a thing, especially at such a critical moment.

Cloud Traveler even cursed aloud.
“Fool!”
*Whoosh!*
The hurricane from the Birdman's giant wings was upon them.  However angry they were, there was nothing they could do. Cloud Traveler hastily adjusted the formation.
With only three people left, the array's power had been reduced to its limit.  It didn't last long before the Birdman tore a hole in it, its sharp claws reaching in, grasping for their skulls.
Qin Sang was filled with anger and fear, but his hands moved swiftly. The Jade Ruyi Talisman was ready. With no other choice, he was forced to deploy it to resolve the immediate crisis.
*Whoosh whoosh…*
The talisman activated, and countless jade ruyis shot forth.
The Birdman was extremely close. Although it sensed the danger, it was too late to dodge. The full force of the talisman struck the Birdman.
Black feathers scattered.
Even with its tough feathers and strong defenses, the Birdman couldn't avoid injury at such close range. A gash was torn in its chest, and blood and feather fragments sprayed out, emitting a foul stench.
The Birdman cried out in pain and flapped its wings to escape back into the sky.
However, while its injuries appeared severe, they were far from fatal.
The Birdman let out a furious roar, its ferocity even greater than before.
Just then, Qin Sang suddenly heard a scream from ahead. It was Ge Yuan.
Qin Sang glanced over and saw Ge Yuan nearing the abyss, about to cross the edge of the red mist.
A beam of white light erupted from the red mist without warning. A vortex seemed to form within the light, pulling Ge Yuan in.
The white light came from a compass-like artifact in Luo Xingnan's hand.
It seemed Luo Xingnan wasn't in much better shape than they were, his hair disheveled and his aura chaotic.
But a cruel smile appeared on Luo Xingnan's face.
Ge Yuan, overjoyed at his imminent escape, hadn't expected Luo Xingnan's sneak attack.  He was caught off guard and pulled into the white light towards Luo Xingnan.
Then, Luo Xingnan's figure flashed, appearing beside Ge Yuan.
At the same time, the white light suddenly turned black, and the pulling force became a powerful repulsive force.
Ge Yuan was struggling outwards, and was instantly flung away like a meteor.  Under Luo Xingnan's control, he flew straight into the jaws of a Hook Snake King.
Ge Yuan was horrified.
Cloud Traveler and the scholar in white seemed to have anticipated this, their expressions unsurprised.
Cloud Traveler repeated coldly,
"Fool!"
