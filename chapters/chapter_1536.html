<h1>Chapter 1527: Civilization </h1><p>Nine years later.</p><p>The divine shuttle sped solitarily through the storm, tireless, yet the end remained unseen.</p><p>Having experienced the calamity of the ferocious beast.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were even more cautious and weary than before, taking longer breaks each time.</p><p>Additionally, an idea sprouted in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Since there were living beings surviving in the storm belt, were there other unknown existences?</p><p>With this thought in mind, whenever he had spare time, Qin Sang would make a circuit around each refuge.</p><p>Even if he did discover something by doing so, the probability of gaining an opportunity was far lower than encountering danger.</p><p>With Qin Sang's temperament, every adventurous action was carefully considered, weighing the gains and losses first. He wouldn't do something that had almost no benefit.</p><p>However, he was always tireless in this pursuit.</p><p>It wasn't the expectation of an opportunity.</p><p>It stemmed from the desire for knowledge, the yearning for the unknown in this mysterious world!</p><p>In the vast and boundless storm belt, the area Qin Sang could explore was merely a negligible fraction, akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>In fact, he hadn't made any new discoveries, nor had he even encountered a second ferocious beast.</p><p>Inside the divine shuttle.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state and put away the Demon Banner in his hand.</p><p>More than twenty years of arduous work had not been in vain, Qin Sang's energy was almost entirely devoted to the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>Inside his dantian, the fire lotus was noticeably larger than before, appearing even more profound. It originally had the shape of a fire lotus seed, but now it was gradually outlining the silhouette of a black lotus.</p><p>"How much longer?"</p><p>Qin Sang blurted out, asking Liuli, who was controlling the divine shuttle.</p><p>Actually, the sea chart was right in front of him, visible at a glance.</p><p>Liuli hadn't awakened him, indicating that everything was going smoothly along the way. Based on the time spent cultivating, he could basically judge the current position of the divine shuttle.</p><p>However, Qin Sang habitually asked Liuli, it was pure small talk.</p><p>If he didn't take the initiative to speak, he believed Liuli could easily maintain silence for a hundred years.</p><p>He didn't know if her personality was innate or formed after experiencing drastic changes.</p><p>"One hour."</p><p>Liuli's crimson lips parted slightly, still sparing her words.</p><p>Progress!</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>In the past, Liuli would only answer questions she deemed meaningful, probably just pointing at the sea chart for him at most. Now she could respond verbally.</p><p>An hour later, they arrived not at the Central Province, but at the next refuge.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't enter meditation again. He took over the divine shuttle, letting Liuli rest.</p><p>The scenery was monotonous, and he had long grown tired of it.</p><p>Qin Sang steered the divine shuttle listlessly, while his mind fantasized about what the next refuge would look like and what kind of surprises it would bring.</p><p>Along the way, the various refuges had truly broadened his horizons.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, an hour passed, and the refuge was in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his scattered thoughts and gazed ahead.</p><p>Sensing something, Liuli also opened her eyes.</p><p>The divine shuttle sped along, and the storm ahead gradually thinned.</p><p>Then, their vision suddenly widened, and the scene of the refuge was presented before them without any obstruction.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were immediately stunned!</p><p>Blue sea and sky.</p><p>Boundless!</p><p>A peculiar barrier separated the inside and outside into two completely different worlds.</p><p>One chaotic, one tranquil.</p><p>Within the barrier, although it was still affected by the storm belt, with continuous strong winds and heavy rain, neither its intensity nor chaos were comparable to the storm belt. It could be called a pure land!</p><p>They were too familiar with this scene.</p><p>Any cultivator who had been to the border between the cultivation world and the storm belt would be familiar with it.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance, both with surprise and confusion in their eyes. They simultaneously looked at the sea chart.</p><p>So vast!</p><p>So peaceful!</p><p>Could the area ahead be a cultivation world?</p><p>Why wasn't it specially marked on the sea chart?</p><p>Along the way, there hadn't been a single mistake on the sea chart.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The divine shuttle effortlessly flew out of the storm belt and entered this world shrouded in blue sky. It was as if all the chaos had been stripped away from them. The long-lost feeling gave them both a sense of inexplicable relaxation.</p><p>"Is it really a cultivation world?"</p><p>Qin Sang was full of doubts. He looked as far as he could and found that this world was far wider than he had imagined. The largest refuge before was just a mountain range.</p><p>When things are out of the ordinary, there must be something strange.</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously stopped the divine shuttle and said in a deep voice, "Let's travel on foot and first find out what kind of place this is. There might be cultivators here."</p><p>Traveling on foot made it easier to conceal their whereabouts.</p><p>The two immediately left the divine shuttle, used their movement techniques, and stepped on the water, gliding forward at a moderate pace.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense into the sea and indeed found traces of fish and shrimp, which proved the existence of life. This place was completely different from those desolate refuges.</p><p>After traveling for some time.</p><p>A black shadow appeared on the sea level. Unsurprisingly, it should be an island.</p><p>From afar, they could see the greenery on the island and the birds leaping among the trees.</p><p>The two slowed down, concealed their figures, and approached the island.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't sense any special aura. He boarded the island, made a circuit, and found no cultivators. But he discovered some unusual traces in a jungle.</p><p>"This was once a human settlement."</p><p>Liuli landed between two large trees and said with certainty.</p><p>She waved her sleeve to sweep away the weeds and withered vines, revealing a section of a damaged stone wall. She also unearthed pottery and other utensils from the soil, obviously traces of intelligent beings.</p><p>However, judging from the desolate scenery, it was unknown how many years ago these ruins were from.</p><p>"There were indeed people! Or at least, intelligent beings!"</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>This discovery alone could separate this place from those refuges.</p><p>The two stayed briefly and continued their journey, finding several more islands.</p><p>After careful searching, they discovered more ruins suspected to be human settlements, but without exception, they were buried under lush jungles, eroded over time, and almost integrated with nature.</p><p>They found birds, beasts, fish, and insects here, a natural balance, full of vitality, but no people!</p><p>These islands were separated from the storm belt by a certain distance and were not greatly affected by the storm. For mortals, the resources on the islands were very abundant. Why were they completely abandoned?</p><p>The two became increasingly puzzled and sped up.</p><p>"We've reached the mainland!"</p><p>Qin Sang said softly.</p><p>Another shadow appeared on the sea level, but unlike before, the two ends of the shadow were not visible, far beyond the scale of those islands.</p><p>The two felt even more strange.</p><p>No matter how picky the people here were, they couldn't abandon such a large continent, right?</p><p>However, the islands on the edge of the continent were also the same as before, as if they had been abandoned for thousands or tens of thousands of years, with no trace of human habitation. It was too illogical.</p><p>Based on various clues, Qin Sang and Liuli thought of a possibility, and their expressions became increasingly grave.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>They flew across the sea and landed on the continent.</p><p>Looking down from above, their vision was filled with a boundless green carpet.</p><p>On the land.</p><p>Mountains undulated, and peaks stood tall.</p><p>Rivers surged, and hundreds of streams flowed into the sea.</p><p>Birds sang, flowers bloomed, and wild beasts roamed.</p><p>Beneath the beautiful scenery, however, was another kind of desolation.</p><p>Near the coast and along the rivers, these fertile places, yet no matter how hard they looked, they couldn't find a single city, a village, or a human figure!</p><p>"The spiritual energy here is very thin."</p><p>Liuli looked around and mentioned her discovery.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and added, "There are no cultivators, no demonic beasts, these are understandable. But where did the humans who originally lived here go?"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang's figure suddenly plummeted, landing at the confluence of mountains and rivers, a fertile plain.</p><p>As expected, there were indeed ruins nearby!</p><p>Qin Sang flew around the ruins and was surprised to find that this should have been a city, and it could be considered a majestic city in the mortal world.</p><p>Even the capital of the Great Sui Dynasty was only like this!</p><p>The wooden buildings in the city had long decayed, but many traces remained, including some city walls and stone walls built with stones.</p><p>Of course, these ruins were no exception. Most of them were buried in the soil, and the exposed parts were covered with weeds and vines, severely weathered.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to find traces of war, to no avail, and expanded the search area.</p><p>Soon they found the ruins of other cities. The reason they were so easy to find was that these cities were very densely packed, one could imagine how prosperous it was back then.</p><p>But it had all become history.</p><p>They were no longer limited to exploring the ruins of mortals, and began to search for traces of cultivators, observing the terrain, following the changes in spiritual energy, and exploring spiritual veins.</p><p>Gradually, they went deeper into the mainland.</p><p>The two did not deliberately search, but they found many more city ruins. As they went deeper, they finally sensed a place in this barren world that was considered quite good for low-level cultivators.</p><p>This was already deep inside the continent.</p><p>All the nearby spiritual veins converged in one direction, which was extremely unlikely to be formed naturally. It was likely that it was formed by artificially moving spiritual veins!</p><p>Their spirits lifted, they quickened their pace, and traced back to the source.</p><p>Soon, a mountain range came into view, like a crouching azure dragon, concealing the wind and gathering energy. It was truly a place of spiritual beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli paused slightly, staring straight at the highest peak of the mountain range.</p><p>This peak was towering and steep, the highest they had seen.</p><p>The most peculiar thing was that a tall stone stele stood on the top of the mountain. It was the most eye-catching object here.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli landed in front of the stone stele.</p><p>The stone stele had words.</p><p>Iron-like strokes and silver-like hooks.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand to pull away the vines that covered the stone stele, saw the full view, and his figure suddenly froze like a sculpture.</p><p>"Here, there was once a civilization."</p><p>Simple words, a calm tone.</p><p>What Qin Sang felt was extreme sorrow. His mind was struck heavily, and the ruins flashed through his mind like fleeting shadows. His breath almost froze.</p><p>There was once a civilization here, extremely prosperous.</p><p>Now, the civilization... had been extinguished!</p><p>In the jungle, under the loess, were buried the only traces left by this civilization.</p><p>The wind on the top of the mountain was very strong, cutting their faces like knives.</p><p>Qin Sang stood silently, unable to speak for a long time.</p><p>The stone stele.</p><p>He didn't know if it was the final words of this civilization.</p><p>Or like them, passersby, a tombstone erected for this civilization.</p><p>When he learned that the entire world was a boundless storm belt, and that the cultivation world they were in was protected by the barrier outside, Qin Sang couldn't help but have a thought.</p><p>What despair would it be on the day the barrier was destroyed!</p><p>The barrier here was not destroyed, but the civilization was extinguished for some unknown reason.</p><p>These Nascent Soul cultivators, seemingly standing at the peak of the world, actually did not have the ability to escape the cage. How different were they from the civilization trapped here and destroyed here?</p><p>No amount of imagination could compare to the shock of seeing the facts with one's own eyes.</p><p>Reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles.</p><p>Truly said.</p><p>"Huff..."</p><p>After a long time, Qin Sang exhaled the breath that had accumulated in his chest and looked at Liuli.</p><p>Liuli stared at the stone stele, her lips tightly pursed.</p><p>After so many years together, Qin Sang knew Liuli's temperament. She only showed this expression when making important decisions or when her mind was agitated.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed to the stone stele and said softly, "I'll go look elsewhere."</p><p>There were indeed traces of suspected cultivators around.</p><p>It was likely that the cultivators here were not of very high cultivation, and the restrictions they left behind could not have existed for so long. Moreover, there must have been passersby who came here earlier than them, and even if there was anything, it would have been taken away.</p><p>Qin Sang made a circuit, but unfortunately, he didn't find any other records.</p><p>Why the civilization was extinguished was a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the stone stele. Liuli's expression had returned to calm, and she also bowed deeply to the stone stele.</p><p>The two set off silently.</p><p>It had always been like this between them, but this time the atmosphere was even more solemn than before. Even with their mental fortitude, they needed some time to digest it.</p><p>This was the smallest and most barren cultivation world Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>They traveled to every corner, but in the end, they didn't find a single person.</p><p>They gained nothing.</p><p>They didn't want to stay here any longer.</p><p>On a deserted island, the two stopped to rest. They had not experienced any battles, but they were more tired than ever.</p><p>Qin Sang adjusted his breathing slightly, opened the corpse puppet bag, and summoned Ya Gu. He habitually checked her condition and helped her activate the bone curse, combing her blood and energy.</p><p>After finishing this, Qin Sang found that Liuli had woken up at some point and was looking at him.</p><p>Liuli hesitated for a moment, then asked softly, "Is she... your Dao Companion?"</p><p>They had been together day and night for more than twenty years, and Liuli had seen Ya Gu long ago, but this was the first time she had asked.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, put Ya Gu back into the corpse puppet bag, shielded her five senses, and then said, "Her name is Jin Liuying, and she did me a favor. I originally wanted to end the karma, but unexpectedly, she was implicated by me and suffered a calamity..."</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, recalling his initial experience entering the Canglang Sea, and slowly recounted the story of him and Ya Gu to Liuli.</p><p>Liuli sat upright, listening attentively.</p><p>"At the time, out of morality and guilt, I vowed to do my best to save her. But later I discovered that the Heavenly Corpse Talisman was not that simple. I collected all kinds of corpse Dao methods, tried every means but was helpless, which has led to delays until now.</p><p>"To be honest, I didn't expect her to last until now, it's not in line with common sense.</p><p>"I can feel her struggling in the darkness, on the edge of losing herself, desperately clinging to every fragile lifeline.</p><p>"It's hard to imagine what kind of belief, what kind of strength, allowed a girl who was only at the Qi Refinement stage back then to persist until now. During this time, she even saved me once..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, gently stroked the corpse puppet bag, and said firmly, "She is still struggling to survive, how can I give up? As long as she persists, I will definitely do my best to find a way to save her! I hope there will be a turning point when we go to the Central Province. After entering the Central Province, I also hope that you, Immortal Fairy, can help me look for traces of the Ghost Mother."</p><p>While listening to the story, Liuli had been very quiet, seemingly absorbed in thought.</p><p>Her eyelashes trembled slightly, and Liuli raised her eyes, looking at Qin Sang's face.</p><p>She nodded heavily.</p><p>"Alright!"</p>
