<h1>Chapter 175, Dual-Form Divine Formula</h1><p>Qin Sang activated his water-element spiritual power and condensed it into a coffin of ice, in which he sealed the couple. He would select an appropriate location to bury them when he left and then gathered Liu Shan's body.</p><p>Of the original eight people, five had already died, and they still did not know what had happened to Yu Daiyue and Li Zai. According to Qingting, the forbidden ground of the Heavenly Corpse Sect's branch altar was located behind this great hall. Regardless of which cave one entered from, they would all meet up there. But Yu Daiyue and Li Zai still had not shown up.</p><p>The Liu brothers had not told the whole truth. The two had not studied the same cultivation method. What enabled them to combine their strength to unleash power that was not inferior to Foundation Formation cultivators was a mystic technique called the "Dual-Form Divine Formula."</p><p>This mystic technique was very unique, and its origins were likely not simple.</p><p>However, they had not lied in one regard: the Dual-Form Divine Formula did indeed need to be cultivated by two people whose intentions connected. It was useless for Qin Sang, and so he casually put it away.</p><p>What Qin Sang was most curious about was the talisman treasure. Printed on the extremely resilient, snow-white paper was a jade Ruyi scepter that emanated a faint, bright light. The small jade Ruyi scepter almost seemed ready to break through the paper; it was brimming with spirituality.</p><p>Although he had seen them before on more than one occasion, this was the first time that he had ever possessed a talisman treasure in all his years of cultivation. A mere sheet of paper could seal ten percent of a magic artifact's power. It truly was magical.</p><p>The martial youth whom he had encountered in the Eight Trigrams forbidden ground also had a talisman treasure. It was a crescent-shaped curved blade, but the martial youth only had Qi Refinement cultivation and did not know how to temper it, so he could only utilize part of its power.</p><p>As a Foundation Formation cultivator, Senior Martial Sister Qingting could unleash the full power of the talisman treasure. Earlier, when she had activated the talisman treasure to attack the evil corpse, it had astonished Qin Sang.</p><p>Even an extraordinary magical artifact was far inferior to a talisman treasure. It was a shame that Senior Martial Sister Qingting had been severely injured after being sneak-attacked by the evil corpse, making it impossible to change the situation.</p><p>In addition, activating a talisman treasure required a period of sacrifice and the infusion of a large amount of spiritual power, which was extremely taxing.</p><p>Qin Sang handled the talisman treasure and looked it over for a while before carefully putting it away. He walked to the black iron door and, according to Senior Martial Sister Qingting's instructions, undid the seal on the iron door.</p><p>He had previously broken seals by brute force, but by using Senior Martial Sister Qingting's method, he would not destroy the seal itself, allowing him to close the black iron gate after he entered to block the sinister energy.</p><p>The Five Elements Sword became a sword light, tapping the black iron door repeatedly. Each tap was very light, and it appeared that he had not used much strength. Before long, the seal had unexpectedly been broken effortlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang could not help but be amazed by Senior Martial Sister Qingting's comprehension of seals. Once he had confirmed that there was no danger behind the black iron door, he manipulated his spiritual power into a palm and forced it open with great effort.</p><p>"Ka-ka…"</p><p>The black iron door slowly opened. Unexpectedly, there was no stone path beyond it, but rather an enormous, empty cavern. As the iron door opened, an incomparably rich spiritual power immediately rushed out, reinvigorating Qin Sang's spirits.</p><p>The cavern was the core forbidden ground of the Heavenly Corpse Sect's branch altar!</p><p>Just as he prepared to walk inside, a muffled boom suddenly sounded out from behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang paused and turned around. He saw that a row of stone doors was at the front of the great hall. One of them was covered with cracks before suddenly shattering. A black shadow flashed out.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. His thoughts raced, and he did not choose to conceal himself. He had already seen that the black shadow was Yu Daiyue, not an evil corpse. The traces of battle in the great hall would not escape Yu Daiyue's eyes, so there was no need to hide.</p><p>In addition, he had already scanned the area and discovered that the space behind the black iron door was also a ruin that had been looted, likely leaving no treasures behind.</p><p>"Huh, Junior Martial Brother Qin?"</p><p>Yu Daiyue rushed into the great hall and was shocked to see someone standing in front of him. He immediately activated his magical artifact and assumed a defensive pose. Upon seeing that this person was Qin Sang, he was surprised.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother Yu." Qin Sang greeted Yu Daiyue and looked behind him, but Li Zai was nowhere to be seen. It seemed that Yu Daiyue had also come here alone.</p><p>Yu Daiyue sighed in relief and dismissed his protective magical artifact. He spoke with some lingering fear in his voice. "I did not encounter a single person along the way, and I had thought that everyone had… Fortunately! Fortunately! Junior Martial Brother Qin went extremely fast. I wonder if you encountered any evil corpses. These evil corpses are truly formidable…"</p><p>As he spoke, Yu Daiyue sized up the great hall. Then, halfway through his words, he suddenly noticed the evil corpse on the ground whose head had been pierced by the spirit sword. His voice abruptly stopped, and a look of shock appeared on his face. He subconsciously gulped.</p><p>"Erm... this zombie is killed by Junior Brother Qin?"</p><p>Seeing Yu Daiyue's astonished expression, Qin Sang said calmly: "Senior Brother Yu holds me in too high esteem. The one who killed the zombie is Senior Sister Qingting. If it weren't for her, I might have already become the zombie's prey."</p><p>Yu Daiyue was overjoyed. He looked around and asked, "Senior Sister Qingting is here as well? Where is she now?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned solemn and said, "Senior Sister Qingting is gone now."</p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p>Yu Daiyue's expression changed drastically. He whipped his head around and stared at Qin Sang, his aura flaring up.</p><p>Under the pressure of Yu Daiyue's aura, Qin Sang felt the strong sense of wariness in his eyes. Unmoved, he took out the ice coffin from his mustard seed bag and recounted the events of earlier, also showing him the corpses of the Liu brothers.</p><p>The fatal wound on Qingting's body was clearly left by the zombie. Furthermore, before she passed away, she was hugging Senior Brother Jiang, her expression calm. There was no sign of resentment from being plotted against, which left no room for Yu Daiyue to doubt.</p><p>With a long sigh, Yu Daiyue said bitterly, "I had already expected that the Liu brothers would be separated and unable to use their joint attack. But I didn't think that Senior Sister Qingting, being the most powerful among us, would perish by the zombie's hand. I wonder how Junior Brother Wu and the other two are doing now..."</p><p>Qin Sang said: "These zombies are strange, but they're still mindless creatures after all. Senior Brother Wu and the others must have some life-saving measures, so don't worry too much. Before she passed away, Senior Sister Qingting told me that there must be artifacts in the restricted area ahead. They can be used to control the seals here. We should open the seals first and wait patiently for the fellow Daoists..."</p><p>He knew that Perfected Baiyuns真人 and Wu Yuesheng would definitely not appear. The only thing to do was to see if Li Zai was fortunate enough to escape in. However, one must play their part diligently.</p><p>The most significant threat now was the baleful yin energy. Yu Daiyue was well aware of this too. He was just shocked by Qingting's death and was flustered for a moment. Upon Qin Sang's reminder, he immediately came around and said repeatedly: "Junior Brother Qin is right. We should open the seals quickly and block out the baleful yin energy. I wonder if Junior Brother Qin has tried it. Are the artifacts for the seals easy to handle?"</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the iron door with great force and shook his head. "When Senior Brother Yu arrived, I had just cracked the seal on the iron door and hadn't had the time to go in and check."</p><p>Yu Daiyue glanced towards the iron door. When he saw the ruins inside, he nodded and followed Qin Sang in.</p>
