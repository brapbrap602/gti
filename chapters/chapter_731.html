<h1>Chapter 723: Sealing</h1><p>Chapter 723: Sealing</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening roar echoed across the sea from time to time.</p><p>Two figures, one chasing the other, churned up massive waves in their wake.</p><p>The two-headed beast was clearly in worse shape, its fur ruffled and singed in several places.  It breathed heavily, occasionally glancing back as it fled.</p><p>After using its shadow clone technique three times, it had put a considerable distance between itself and the man in black armor.  However, the man remained relentlessly in pursuit, stubbornly clinging to its trail.</p><p>The man in black armor, on the other hand, looked increasingly confident, treating the two-headed beast as his prey.</p><p>He suddenly accelerated, pursuing with all his might.  The two-headed beast responded by splitting into six more clones.</p><p>“You fiend! You think I’m helpless just because I’ve run out of the spirit liquid in my bamboo tube? I’ll see just how many times you can use this shadow technique and how far you can run!”</p><p>The man in black armor roared, a phantom mirror rising from his head once more.  Wielding the mirror was taxing, but seeing the two-headed beast's weakened state, he pressed on regardless.  The prolonged chase had greatly exhausted the beast, making this the perfect time to use the mirror.</p><p>The mirror slowly rotated before locking onto the third of the two-headed beast's clones on the left—it had easily located the real one.</p><p>The man in black armor sneered, raising his black spear, ready to strike.  Suddenly, his expression changed, and he whipped his head around.  A blue light flashed from the direction of Cold Flame Island—a clear sign of the Cold Flame erupting!</p><p>“Winter Nether Flame!”</p><p>He cried out in alarm.</p><p>His duty bound him. Seeing the Winter Nether Flame’s erratic behavior, he immediately abandoned the chase and flew towards Cold Flame Island.</p><p>Moments later, he appeared above Cold Flame Island, his face grim as he looked down.</p><p>The eruption of the Cold Flame had frozen the surrounding sea, starting from Cold Flame Island as the epicenter.  In a short time, the ice layer had reached several meters thick, demonstrating the flame's destructive power.</p><p>The Winter Nether Flame raged uncontrollably, erupting repeatedly.</p><p>The man in black armor hastily produced a jade talisman, about to send a message, when he saw the Winter Nether Flame inexplicably calm down. His movements faltered, a look of suspicion crossing his face…</p><p>Meanwhile, south of Cold Flame Island…</p><p>Qin Sang, Tian Mudie, and the two-headed beast had reunited.</p><p>“Good job!”</p><p>Qin Sang mounted the two-headed beast, patting its head in approval.</p><p>Successfully retrieving the Winter Nether Flame put him in a good mood.</p><p>The two-headed beast shook its head, trying to escape Qin Sang’s grasp.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, unfazed, offering the beast a spirit pill.  Looking up at the vast demon sea, he said solemnly, “I wonder if we’ve alerted the island master of Huntian Island… We can’t go back the way we came, we must avoid Huntian Island. A bit of risk is unavoidable. Let’s go straight to Duyan Island. You'll have to work hard…”</p><p>He held the fireball, still unsure how to subdue the Cold Flame, and dared not put away the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner, so he had to ride the two-headed beast.</p><p>For some reason, the two-headed beast seemed to have recovered considerably. After swallowing the spirit pill, it silently dashed forward.</p><p>Qin Sang kept an eye on what was behind, ensuring the man in black armor hadn’t followed, before focusing his attention on the Winter Nether Flame.</p><p>“Winter Nether Sage is too powerful. This is a spirit flame intrinsically linked to him, inseparable from his very being.  No wonder even powerful demons and the Huntian Island master were helpless. Even if I were given decades, I couldn't remove the Winter Nether Sage’s essence. What am I going to do?”</p><p>Qin Sang was at a loss, seemingly powerless against the Winter Nether Flame.</p><p>Although the Nine Nether Demon Fire could suppress the Winter Nether Flame, the two were utterly incompatible. If Qin Sang tried to use the Nine Nether Demon Fire to invade or consume the Winter Nether Flame, it would inevitably trigger a massive eruption.</p><p>“For now, I can only try to stabilize the Cold Flame first. I can’t keep it in my hand forever. I’ll figure out how to subdue it later. Perhaps I could use a restrictive formation…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, a plan forming in his mind.</p><p>Stabilizing the Winter Nether Flame would require the Nine Nether Demon Fire's power.</p><p>He held the fireball in one hand and drew in the air with the other, his fingertip qi flashing as he quickly formed a rune. Then, he used his spiritual sense to draw a wisp of Nine Nether Demon Fire, attaching it to the rune.</p><p>After dozens of failed attempts, he finally gained some experience.</p><p>The flame-suppressing formation slowly took shape, as black as the Nine Nether Demon Fire, floating towards Qin Sang's other hand.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's careful control, the flame-suppressing formation pierced through the Nine Nether Demon Fire and attached itself to the surface of the Cold Flame, sealing it.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, withdrew his spiritual sense, and extinguished the Nine Nether Demon Fire.  Seeing that the Winter冥寒焰 remained stable, a weight lifted from his heart.  He hastily retrieved a large jade box from his Qianjun Ring and carefully placed the Winter冥寒焰 inside.</p><p>…</p><p>Having secured the Winter冥寒焰, Qin Sang didn't dare delay. He left with the two-headed… (creature name unclear, needs clarification).</p><p>He avoided Huntian Island, choosing the riskier route around it.  Once back on the established sea route, he headed straight for Duyan Island.</p><p>He returned by the same path.</p><p>Along the way, he saw large ships sailing, evidence of the reconciliation between the two factions.  Qin Sang was familiar with the area, and now with the Hun Yuan concentric ring, his journey was even easier, so he didn't board any ships.</p><p>He soon arrived near Siming Island.  There was no sign of the Huntian Island lord pursuing him, so he returned to Duyan Island without incident.</p><p>Unexpectedly, twenty years had passed since he last left the island.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a little dazed, the years of arduous monster hunting seeming like a dream.</p><p>He put on his cloak and flew towards Duyan Island.  He encountered a patrol, showed his Qiongyu Trading Company guest elder token, and was immediately allowed to pass.</p><p>“It seems the Qiongyu Trading Company still has a presence on the island. I wonder if there have been any changes in personnel,” he mused, as Duyan Island came into view.</p><p>Duyan Island and its city were unchanged from his departure, untouched by the conflict between the two factions.</p><p>“I was worrying needlessly,” Qin Sang chuckled to himself, leaping down to the city gate. He entered the city on foot, walking towards the location of the Qiongyu Trading Company's branch in his memory.</p><p>The branch office still displayed its signboard; cultivators came and went, business as usual.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached, about to enter, several cultivators emerged from within.</p><p>Two of them, women, glanced at Qin Sang.  His appearance stirred a familiar feeling in their hearts.</p><p>The two women exchanged a look, their faces brightening with surprise.  Before their companions could react, they darted forward, blocking Qin Sang's path.  Suppressing their excitement, one asked, "Excuse me, senior, but is your Daoist name Qingfeng…?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled gently, interrupting them. “Why, haven’t you two friends recognized me after all these years?”</p><p>The two women were the Wang sisters who had accompanied him on monster-hunting expeditions years ago, becoming separated during a Wuzhu ambush on their return journey.</p><p>Running into old acquaintances upon his return was unexpected.  He was particularly moved to see that the older Wang sister had successfully formed her Golden Core.</p>
