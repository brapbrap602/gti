<h1>Chapter 442: The Standoff</h1><p>Both individuals appeared severely injured, though their lives were not in danger.</p><p>The Scattered Islands were all barren, covered in wild grass and moss, some even piled high with bird droppings.</p><p>Unconcerned, these esteemed Nascent Soul cultivators found level ground and immediately began to meditate and heal, racing against time.</p><p>Shortly after the Golden Core cultivators appeared, a rumbling echoed from beyond the Mist Sea, as if someone was attacking the Truewater Mirage Formation from outside.</p><p>Muffled by the Mist Sea, the booming sounds were nonetheless astonishingly powerful and continuous.</p><p>The Mist Sea began to tremble.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, within the formation, could vaguely see orbs of various colors illuminating the depths of the mist.</p><p>These orbs represented potent spells and magical artifacts. Though still faint and unable to penetrate the Mist Sea, their sheer number placed immense pressure on the Small Cold Region cultivators.</p><p>It was unclear how many Heaven's Decree Alliance cultivators had arrived. The flickering orbs resembled an unending display of fireworks.</p><p>Each boom resonated deep within everyone's hearts. Whispers spread amongst them, their gazes fixed anxiously on the Mist Sea, unease etched on many faces.</p><p>If the formation broke, close-quarters combat would be unavoidable. Even if they weren't slaughtered by the Golden Core cultivators, being caught in the crossfire would be no less devastating. They could only hope the Truewater Mirage Formation was strong enough to withstand the Heaven's Decree Alliance's assault.</p><p>Fortunately, despite the constant turbulence, the Mist Sea remained stable.</p><p>As time passed, the Heaven's Decree Alliance cultivators seemed to realize the futility of their scattered attacks and began to coordinate their efforts.</p><p>The orbs converged, shining brightly like a miniature sun, advancing and retreating in unison.</p><p>Each attack caused the Mist Sea to tremble several times more violently than before, even showing signs of dissipating, further amplifying the unease among the defenders.</p><p>Faced with the coordinated assault, Cultivator Di and the others, who were controlling the formation, were nearing their limit.</p><p>Seeing this, Serpent Witch roused some of the less injured Golden Core cultivators to assist Cultivator Di in maintaining the Truewater Mirage Formation.  She then personally guided the Foundation Establishment disciples to channel their spiritual energy into the disc, contributing what they could.</p><p>With the arrival of these reinforcements, the Mist Sea gradually stabilized, and the two sides reached a stalemate.</p><p>Unable to breach the formation, the Heaven's Decree Alliance's attacks became less frequent.</p><p>Hail fell from the sky, accompanied by icy winds.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a reef, drenched in sweat, his spiritual energy almost depleted.  Seeing the Heaven's Decree Alliance's stalled offensive, he knew it had all been worthwhile.</p><p>The hail turned to drizzle.</p><p>The previously frozen water surface melted instantly.</p><p>The fantastical scene drew gasps of wonder.</p><p>All had been quiet beyond the Mist Sea for a long time. It was unknown what the Heaven's Decree Alliance cultivators were doing.</p><p>Had they given up?</p><p>Or were they seeking other ways to break the formation?</p><p>“Old Hag!”</p><p>A shout suddenly erupted from beyond the Mist Sea. “Hiding inside the formation like a coward?  Have the guts to come out and fight!”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Serpent Witch.  She was helping Cultivator Di reinforce the Truewater Mirage Formation, her head down, completely ignoring the Heaven's Decree Alliance's taunts.</p><p>Repeated provocations, met with silence, only fueled the Heaven's Decree Alliance's increasingly vicious insults.</p><p>“Why isn't the Old Hag saying anything?”</p><p>“Scared witless, is she?”</p><p>“Is she busy dual cultivating with her snake demon lover? Eh? Haha…”</p><p>“I knew it all along.  The Old Hag and the Snake Monster have been exchanging glances. Their relationship is definitely not simple. I just don't know how they dual cultivate, considering the snake monster's lower half hasn't transformed yet.”</p><p>“Dual cultivating with one's own spirit beast? That's a first for me. No wonder those from the Small Cold Region are called Northern Barbarians. Only uncivilized savages would do such a thing!”</p><p>…</p><p>Obscenities mixed with raucous laughter filled the air as the Heaven's Decree Alliance cultivators hurled every insult they could muster.  The Small Cold Region cultivators were enraged, and some began to shout back.</p><p>Separated by the Mist Sea, they exchanged insults like villagers in a squabble, their vocabulary surprisingly limited.</p><p>Such a spectacle was a rare sight in the cultivation world.</p><p>Serpent Witch remained impassive, as if the insults weren't directed at her.</p><p>The serpentine man beside her, however, couldn't endure it. His tail thrashed against the ground, his scarlet tongue flicked rapidly, hissing, his cold eyes fixated on the Mist Sea beyond.  An icy aura, laced with palpable rage, emanated from him.</p><p>Nearby Foundation Establishment cultivators, unable to withstand the pressure, quickly retreated.</p><p>Serpent Witch gently stroked the serpentine man's hair, whispering something in his ear that seemed to calm his fury.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A green light flashed around the serpentine man. When it faded, he had transformed into a finger-thick green snake, which shot towards Serpent Witch's wrist and coiled into a bracelet.</p><p>The taunts continued from outside, and the attacks on the formation resumed.</p><p>With Serpent Witch and the others' assistance, Cultivator Di persevered for a while longer before finally opening his eyes. Wiping the sweat from his face, he sighed in relief, "The formation is complete!"</p><p>No visible change in the formation could be seen with the naked eye, but under the Heaven's Decree Alliance's renewed attacks, the Mist Sea was clearly more stable than before, and the expressions of those controlling it were more relaxed.</p><p>Sensing the change in the Truewater Mirage Formation, the Heaven's Decree Alliance cultivators realized that the Small Cold Region had stabilized their defenses and began to contemplate retreat.</p><p>“Old Hag, let's see how long you can hide like a turtle!  Don't ever come looking for Sky Peak!”</p><p>The curses faded into the distance, and it seemed the Heaven's Decree Alliance cultivators were withdrawing.</p><p>The commotion appeared to have subsided.</p><p>Vice Island Master Xiao sighed. “What a pity.  I didn't expect it to be true. Sky Peak has appeared somewhere nearby!  Had we known, we would have sent more Nascent Soul fellow Daoists to search… Even without precise information, the Heaven's Decree Alliance can guess. They certainly won't give up and will likely amass their forces here.”</p><p>Fang and Shentu, who had been healing, spoke weakly, “We apologize for our carelessness in allowing the Heaven's Decree Alliance to discover our movements. Please punish us, Island Masters.”</p><p>Serpent Witch shook her head. “It's not your fault. Sky Peak is crucial to the Purple Palace conflict, their only chance. Even if Old Woman me and Fellow Daoist Xiao had come personally, it would have been difficult to avoid their notice.  Although we know Sky Peak has drifted into the waters ahead, finding its exact location will take time.  Sky Peak's concealing restrictions are not easily discovered.  It's still anyone's game.”</p><p>After a pause, Serpent Witch continued.</p><p>“Since Sky Peak has appeared, this place will become the battleground between our Small Cold Region and the Heaven's Decree Alliance until we find it.  Major battles are inevitable.</p><p>“We shall rebuild Stargazer Island here, using the Truewater Mirage Formation as a foundation.</p><p>“Time is of the essence. I'll send messages to the various sects, summoning their disciples to provide support.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Di, I must trouble you to send word back to your sect, requesting a few fellow Daoists to come and strengthen the Truewater Mirage Formation.  All necessary spirit materials can be taken from Stargazer Island.”</p>
