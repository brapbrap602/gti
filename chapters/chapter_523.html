At this stage, the Golden Core resided in the qi sea, barely pacified by the corpse refinement restrictions. Disturbing the qi sea and disrupting the balance would provoke backlash from the Golden Core.</p><p>Prepared, Qin Sang approached the Azure Yang Sect. Concealed, he observed the sect.</p><p>Lofty mountains, lush and green.</p><p>Clouds wreathed the mountain edges, cranes cried, a scene of immortal tranquility, making one question whether this was truly a demonic sect's home.</p><p>The Azure Yang Sect was divided into three layers: outer, inner, and forbidden, each sealed by spirit arrays.</p><p>The outer sect was for guests, spirit beasts, medicinal gardens, and other external affairs.</p><p>The green mountains Qin Sang saw were part of the outer sect.</p><p>Eight such mountains were arranged in the eight cardinal directions, so perfectly aligned it seemed a powerful being had moved them with supernatural power.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fell upon a white jade staircase on the southern mountain, leading straight to the summit, vanishing into the clouds.</p><p>The sect's entrance was at the top of the staircase. Entry required ascending this path.</p><p>Beyond the outer sect lay the inner sect, the disciples' cultivation grounds.</p><p>The forbidden zone was a heavily restricted area within the inner sect, the core of the Azure Yang Sect.  Fortunately, Qin Sang didn't need to enter it.  Divine罡 Peak, where the Azure Yang罡 Qi descended, was in the inner sect.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the sect, found a hidden spot in the wilderness outside, and buried his treasures deep underground, including his pouches and spirit beast bag, carefully concealing them with restrictions.</p><p>Still uneasy with his entire fortune buried, he checked again before quietly leaving.</p><p>Dawn broke in the distant east, the sun about to rise.</p><p>Qin Sang increased his speed, heading southwest, racing through the mountains and forests.</p><p>He was far from Azure Yang Market, but Boundless Valley was near the Azure Yang Sect, and Azure Yang Market was the largest market in the nearby cultivation world.  He might encounter cultivators traveling through the wilderness, so he remained cautious.</p><p>He crossed dozens of mountains and rivers without encountering anyone.</p><p>Reaching a mountain pass, he abruptly stopped.</p><p>West of the Azure Yang Sect lay a mortal kingdom, one of the sect's vassals.</p><p>Further southwest lay the kingdom's border towns, one of which was a small city named Qingcheng, inhabited by mortals.</p><p>Qingcheng was on the border. Eastward, there were no more mortal cities, only wilderness, as it was close to Boundless Valley, where cultivators were active.</p><p>This mountain pass was the only route from Qingcheng to the Azure Yang Sect.</p><p>He suppressed his aura, descended into the pass, looked around, and began to work.  From the entrance, he scattered bloodstains, footprints, chaotic spiritual energy, and broken plants.</p><p>Soon, the pass was transformed. Qin Sang created the illusion of a gravely injured cultivator desperately escaping, shaking off pursuers, only to succumb to his wounds in the pass.</p><p>He placed the corpse at the end of the blood trail, lying in the grass.</p><p>Combined with the manipulations he'd made on the corpse, the scene was convincing. Even Qin Sang himself might have been momentarily fooled if he'd stumbled upon it unexpectedly.</p><p>Cautious, he checked again, then flashed to the corpse and channeled corpse qi through his body.</p><p>Instantly, his appearance changed.</p><p>Green-faced, fanged, and狰狞, a true corpse, his original features unrecognizable.</p><p>“Good thing I can revert by suppressing the corpse qi, or this face would make travel impossible,” Qin Sang muttered, touching his cheek.</p><p>Disguised as a corpse, he couldn't use restrictions to mask his face, relying instead on the corpse qi transformation.</p><p>Shadowless Sword's reputation was widespread in the Chaotic Islands. Qin Sang was somewhat famous now and couldn't risk being recognized.</p><p>He casually tossed the coffin near the corpse and slipped inside, waiting patiently.</p><p>His choice of who would bring him into the Azure Yang Sect wasn't random.</p><p>During his twenty-eight years in Azure Yang Market, Qin Sang had shed his high-ranking cultivator demeanor, frequently interacting with Azure Yang Sect disciples, mentally compiling dossiers on those he spoke with.</p><p>He knew less about the higher-ranking disciples he'd interacted with less.</p><p>But he was very familiar with those below Foundation Establishment and a few early Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>His chosen target was Yu Batian, an early Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Talented, Yu Batian had reached Foundation Establishment smoothly but had been stuck at the early stage bottleneck for decades, similar to Yu Daiyue.</p><p>However, his character was far inferior to Yu Daiyue's.</p><p>Yu Daiyue, driven to madness, had attacked fellow disciples only after exhausting all other options.</p><p>Qin Sang had interacted with Yu Batian many times.</p><p>Yu Batian constantly complained, often speaking of how others had gained recognition from their elders or obtained great fortunes and treasures.</p><p>When mentioning renowned cultivators, he attributed their achievements to luck, without exception, even for fellow disciples he knew well.</p><p>He would then lament his own bad luck, complaining about never receiving a decent opportunity and cursing the heavens for his bottleneck.</p><p>Yu Batian himself wasn't a diligent cultivator.  He grew restless after a few days of secluded cultivation, leaving to drink and carouse, joining fellow disciples to hunt demons in Boundless Valley, always the first to return.</p><p>He'd never visited the ancient battlefield.</p><p>He was also obsessed with worldly pleasures, his lust growing with age.</p><p>He collected beautiful women, keeping them in Qingcheng.  Periodically, under the guise of training, he would visit Qingcheng for several days of indulgence.</p><p>Since Yu Batian desired fortune so much, Qin Sang decided to give him some.</p><p>He calculated that today was Yu Batian's return from Qingcheng.</p>
