<h1>Chapter 130: Success At Last</h1><p>Upon hearing Sect Master Yu’s command, Qin Sang swallowed the Dragon Bead without hesitation with his mouth agape, then immediately sat down cross-legged and began to meditate.</p><p>With the Dragon Bead in his stomach, a crimson glow appeared from Qin Sang’s body. He looked like a cooked prawn, with all the flesh and blood on his body turning red and releasing an intense heat, which caused the temperature of the cave to rise.</p><p>As time went on, the red light on his body grew stronger, causing the air in the cave to distort due to the heat.</p><p>The features on Qin Sang’s face also slowly began to distort, as if he was enduring unimaginable pain. Large beads of sweat gathered on his forehead like streams, forming a lake of sweat that soaked the ground around him.</p><p>Sect Master Yu stood by and watched coldly without interfering.</p><p>The pain in Qin Sang’s body grew more and more intense, and his body began to tremble like a sieve, making it difficult to maintain his sitting posture. However, he kept his eyes tightly shut, gritted his teeth, and persevered.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>A muffled sound rang out, followed by an explosion on Qin Sang’s arm. His skin broke open and the flesh turned out, and upon closer inspection, it was found that his meridians had ruptured. A red light flashed as the medicinal power of the Danlong Ginseng surged out like a rainbow.</p><p>At the same time, black impurities began to seep out of Qin Sang’s body, but they were immediately scorched by the high temperature and caked onto his body.</p><p>Sect Master Yu extended his hand and grabbed the medicinal power, refining away the impurities it contained. He then retrieved a bottle of spiritual liquid, took out a drop, and dripped it onto Qin Sang’s wound. The wound healed at a visible speed.</p><p>For Qi Condensation Realm disciples, the medicinal power of the Danlong Ginseng was still too strong. Normally, one would slowly consume a little bit of the green liquid, slowly refining it, washing the muscles and cutting the marrow, removing impurities from the body, improving the constitution, and continuing until one could adapt to the medicinal power of the Danlong Ginseng before taking the Dragon Bead and attempting to break through.</p><p>However, the Nascent Soul Patriarch was in a hurry, and Sect Master Yu did not dare to be careless. He simply refined the entire spiritual herb and fed it to Qin Sang. Could he, who could cultivate the “Xuannu Jade Cauldron Scripture”, not endure a little bit of pain?</p><p>Moreover, with him personally protecting Qin Sang, nothing would go wrong.</p><p>Right after, a series of “bang bang bang” sounds rang out.</p><p>Qin Sang’s body was riddled with holes, but Sect Master Yu was able to出手及时 every time, consuming almost half a bottle of healing spiritual liquid and helping Qin Sang overcome this hurdle.</p><p>It was only hard on Qin Sang, who felt like he had been thrown into a furnace. The flesh and blood in his body felt like it was being scraped by a sharp knife and then burned by a raging fire, from head to toe, from inside to outside, until it was焦里焦外.</p><p>Only the occasional bit of coolness when the spiritual liquid landed on his body allowed him to catch his breath.</p><p>Persevere!</p><p>This was the only chance in his life. If he gave up halfway due to being unable to bear the pain, he would never forgive himself!</p><p>Finally, no more impurities emerged from Qin Sang’s body. The red light dimmed, was restrained within his body, and gradually faded away. Just when it was about to disappear, Sect Master Yu poured the medicinal power he had restrained in his hand into Qin Sang’s body, and continued to repeat the previous process.</p><p>Perhaps because he had become numb to it, Qin Sang was able to remain expressionless. Only his body would tremble slightly every time his meridians ruptured, and the tremors became smaller and smaller.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang’s body completely calmed down and his breathing gradually became slower, just like when he was cultivating normally.</p><p>Sect Master Yu suddenly moved to Qin Sang’s side, and scattered the remaining spiritual liquid, using his spiritual power to channel it into Qin Sang’s body, helping him dissolve the medicinal power and completely heal his minor injuries.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang’s condition had truly stabilized, Sect Master Yu nodded, silently opened the door of the cave, and walked out.</p><p>As he turned to look at the cave, a look of envy suddenly appeared on Sect Master Yu’s face. It was not for Qin Sang, but for Patriarch Mawu.</p><p>It was still better to have backing. Even when breaking through, they could be bestowed with the Danlong Ginseng by a Nascent Soul Patriarch who would even protect them.</p><p>Sect Master Yu was heartbroken as he 御剑 flew away.</p><p>……</p><p>A month later.</p><p>In the cave that had been silent for an entire month, a chuckle suddenly rang out. It was a little creepy, especially in the pitch-black cave.</p><p>Right after, the laughter grew louder and louder, turning into a roar, a狂笑.</p><p>The people in the cave laughed as if they were crazy, laughing until they couldn’t catch their breaths, laughing with tears streaming down their faces, and laughing bending over, and they could not stand up straight. They only stopped laughing when they started coughing.</p><p>A rustling sound.</p><p>The Night-illuminating Pearl lit up the cave; Qinsang got up from the ground, put on a new Taoist robe, and his eyes were shining.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment was successful.</p><p>Qinsang looked inside himself, and the changes in the sea of qi were the most obvious. The original gaseous spiritual energy had become viscous during the breakthrough process and completely liquefied when the breakthrough was successful.</p><p>Then Qinsang transformed into a black hole, and the spiritual energy in the cave疯狂 injected into his body. In the first-rate cave of Mount Shaohua, the spiritual energy was endless until the sea of qi was filled again. At this point, Qinsang stopped.</p><p>At that time, the spiritual energy in his body was much more powerful in both quantity and quality than in the Qi Refining Stage. It can be said that it was a world of difference.</p><p>Another change was that the primordial spirit was more solid, and the divine sense was stronger. Not only did the感知 range increase several times compared with the Qi Refining Stage, but the divine sense could leave the body without relying on other things. When encountering some weak restrictions, the divine sense could be used to forcefully break them.</p><p>You do not have to use the clumsy Qi Observing Art like you did when you were in the Qi Refining Stage. With just a sweep of your divine sense, you will be able to perceive the spiritual energy flowing in your body and see your cultivation level.</p><p>In short, there are endless wonderful uses for it.</p><p>"Get out here!"</p><p>Qinsang gave a low growl, a black light flashed by, and the Ebony Sword hovered in front of him, trembling slightly as if it were congratulating its master for successfully breaking through the barrier.</p><p>Qinsang was ecstatic. He activated the "Finger Mystery Sword Tactics", and with a flash of green light, the Ebony Sword started flying in the void and finally transformed into a beautiful green lotus, which did not dissipate for a long time.</p><p>In this move, the spiritual energy in his sea of qi had only been depleted by a little bit, and it was still full. From now on, he didn't have to be so cautious and worry about the consumption of sword qi.</p><p>But his attainments in the way of the sword were not high enough. He still could not turn the sword qi into a rainbow or fly with the sword.</p><p>After enjoying the moment, Qinsang calmed down his inner excitement.</p><p>After calming down, Qinsang had to return to reality. The smile on his face and the excitement in his eyes were gone. Everything was in exchange for him agreeing to be a furnace cauldron.</p><p>Having taken the favors of the senior cultivators of the sect, there was no way to renege on the debt. Not only did he have to do it, but he also had to do it well to satisfy them.</p><p>Qinsang was in no hurry to inform the sect master about his Foundation Establishment. After a short rest, he began to cultivate the "Mysterious Female Jade Tripod True Scripture". He only needed to take the final step to form the jade tripod and fill it with jade liquid, and the technique would be cultivated successfully.</p><p>He had long been mentally prepared to be a furnace cauldron.</p><p>……</p><p>On the peak of the sect master's palace.</p><p>Sect Master Yu and several Foundation Establishment stage stewards were discussing sect matters when a sound transmission talisman suddenly flew into the hall. After reading it, Sect Master Yu looked happy and asked everyone to act independently. Then he rode his sword out of the hall and headed towards Mount Shaohua.</p>
