<h1>Chapter 2080: A Stone in the Lake</h1><p>King Jin Chan stayed at Qingyang Temple for over ten days before departing. Shortly after his leave, another visitor arrived: Valley Master Mu of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley’s cultivation techniques originated from the Witch Clan.  Because these techniques weren’t compatible with human cultivators, they were difficult to master and reached a bottleneck earlier than other sects. Upon learning of the Witch Clan’s relocation, Valley Master Mu decisively moved the entire sect to Central State, now nestled beside the Witch Clan.</p><p>The Witch Clan, the weakest of the three races, sought to cultivate a friendly human force, and Hundred Flowers Valley was precisely what they needed.</p><p>With Elder Fang's approval and the Witch Clan’s support, Hundred Flowers Valley finally perfected its Yuan Ying stage cultivation techniques.  Valley Master Mu subsequently broke through to the Transcendence stage, significantly elevating Hundred Flowers Valley’s status among human cultivators.</p><p>Despite having the entire Witch Clan backing them, Hundred Flowers Valley didn't produce a surge of powerful cultivators. Valley Master Mu’s cultivation also seemed stagnant for many years, making their fame in the Storm World somewhat undeserved.  Outsiders speculated this was due to incomplete cultivation techniques.</p><p>“Please, Valley Master Mu.”</p><p>Due to Qin Sang’s connection with Hundred Flowers Valley, Li Yu Fu and Valley Master Mu maintained a good relationship.</p><p>Both sides carefully preserved this friendship, with frequent interaction between their disciples. However, as Hundred Flowers Valley represented the Witch Clan, all actions had to prioritize the Witch Clan’s interests; openly allying with Qingyang Temple was impossible.</p><p>Perhaps due to Qin Sang's influence, Elder Fang rarely opposed them unless it directly impacted Witch Clan interests.</p><p>Valley Master Mu laughed heartily, “Hearing that True Lord is rebuilding the temple, Daoist Fang instructed me to inquire if you require assistance.”</p><p>As he spoke, his gaze swept across the peaks. Though his eyesight couldn't match that of Crane Ridge True Lord or King Jin Chan, he still recognized the formidable defensive formation.</p><p>“There is indeed a matter I wish to discuss with Valley Master Mu and Daoist Fang…”</p><p>Li Yu Fu warmly invited Valley Master Mu into the main hall and repeated his earlier proposal.</p><p>Soon after, Valley Master Mu emerged from the palace with a serious expression, bowing to Li Yu Fu. “This matter is of great importance. I must immediately inform Daoist Fang. I must take my leave now, but will visit again soon.”</p><p>“Farewell, Valley Master Mu!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu escorted Valley Master Mu outside the mountain, standing on a cloud as he watched the departing figure.</p><p>It was like dropping a pebble into a calm lake.  From the moment Qingyang Temple began its reconstruction, ripples spread through the Storm World.</p><p>Their foundation lay in the North Sea. Previously, relying on their righteousness, strength, and prestige, they had formed alliances and suppressed various powerful figures.  Now, Fairy Glass has been in seclusion for a long time, Qingyang Temple is preoccupied, and their ally, Four Saints Palace in Central State, is starting to withdraw.  Ambitious individuals, seeing their opportunity, will surely begin to emerge.</p><p>This time, my senior uncle clearly aims to eradicate problems, actively pierce the abscess and perform a radical cure.  Hopefully, Elder Fang will remain calm and make wise choices, otherwise, it's unclear how many blows the Witch Clan can withstand.</p><p>For now, we focus on establishing the temple, remain steadfast, and wait for the unfolding of events!</p><p>Li Yu Fu gazed intently into the distance before returning to the palace.</p><p>…</p><p>East Sea.</p><p>Vast ocean.</p><p>After leaving Qingyang Temple, Gui Hou first made a detour to Central State, mostly out of curiosity about the connection between his master and that place.  Since his master hadn't given explicit orders, he wasn't in a hurry; after all, no one in the Storm World could rival him.</p><p>Flying leisurely over the sea, enjoying the cool breeze, Gui Hou felt content.  Upon spotting an island in the distance, he subtly activated a signal.</p><p>Waiting a moment, the sea breeze carried a booming laughter. “Brother Gui has graced us with your presence! Do come ashore, let me prepare a feast and offer my hospitality.”</p><p>The figure of the Black Lion Saint King materialized in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang had introduced them during her last visit.  The Black Lion Saint King, still unaware of Gui Hou's true cultivation, naturally dared not underestimate someone who served his master, treating him with great respect.</p><p>Thinking of these low-level cultivators in this area calling themselves Great Saints and Saint Kings, Gui Hou sneered inwardly.  A bunch of frogs in a well, ignorant of the vast sky. Let them see how my master deals with them!</p><p>Maintaining a calm demeanor, he smiled, "My master has instructed me to remain discreet.  My visit to Brother Black Lion is to request assistance.”</p><p>“Brother Gui, please, speak freely!”</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King gestured grandly.</p><p>Gui Hou bowed, "Thank you in advance, Brother Black Lion.  Once the matter is completed, I shall report your contributions to my master."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Black Lion King became even more eager, urging Gui Hou to continue. Gui Hou asked, "Black Lion, you must have some informants planted among the sea demons, right?"</p><p>Black Lion King's eyes flickered, instinctively wanting to deny it, but immediately realized it was pointless. He nodded readily, "Gui, are they useful to you? This is my token. With this order, they will obey your commands. If any dare to disobey, feel free to eliminate them!"</p><p>Black Lion King produced a brass demon order. Gui Hou accepted it without hesitation. He could easily gather subordinates, but starting from scratch would take longer than leveraging Black Lion King's years of established network.</p><p>He had come for this very purpose. With the order in hand, he took his leave.</p><p>"Gui, wait!"</p><p>Black Lion King hurriedly stopped him, bowing deeply. "To be honest, after meeting the Grand Master last time, I've been filled with anxiety. I yearn to ease the Grand Master's burdens and make amends for past mistakes, but I'm unsure how to win his favor.  You are close to the Grand Master and highly trusted; I hope you can guide me."</p><p>Gui Hou looked at him, noting his sincere attitude.  He stroked his chin and asked, "Do you think it would be difficult for the Grand Master to deal with those disloyal underlings?"</p><p>Black Lion King was taken aback. "What are you saying, Gui?  Those are just insignificant rabble! The Grand Master could crush them with a flick of his finger!"</p><p>"Precisely!"</p><p>Gui Hou chuckled, clapping his hands. "The outcome is predetermined. No matter how hard you try, it won't affect the overall situation or improve the result. If you make a mistake and disrupt the Grand Master's plans, you'll only invite punishment. Why bother?"</p><p>Black Lion King's face fell. "But I can't just stay in my cave doing nothing!"</p><p>"Black Lion, I understand your zeal, but you need to understand the Grand Master's intentions and apply your efforts in the right place. Do you know what the Grand Master truly cares about?" Gui Hou said mysteriously.</p><p>Black Lion King's eyes lit up. "Please enlighten me, Gui!"</p><p>"Eliminating internal traitors, even destroying the Changyou clan – if the Grand Master wished it, it would be effortless. But beyond the Changyou clan are other alien races, and above the Imperial race are even more powerful ones, all potential enemies. Without the strength to defend against external foes, how can we act rashly?" Gui Hou said meaningfully.</p><p>"You mean the Grand Master has even stronger methods to counter all the alien races?"</p><p>Black Lion King swallowed hard. This was beyond his comprehension. "I wonder…"</p><p>Gui Hou interrupted him. "Black Lion, you don't need to know what it is. Just know that the Grand Master is going to build an altar, a powerful altar.  This is what the Grand Master prioritizes. As far as I know, the Grand Master's next step is to reclaim the Demon Sea and the Canglang Sea, and the altar will be placed there. Not every location is suitable for building the altar. If we can scout beforehand and plan accordingly, wouldn't that save the Grand Master a lot of effort?"</p><p>The more Black Lion King listened, the brighter his eyes became. He felt like the clouds had parted, and Gui Hou was his guiding light. He immediately offered his assistance, but Gui Hou waved him off.</p><p>"Black Lion, you haven't grasped the key point!"</p><p>Gui Hou sighed and explained frankly, "The Grand Master needs a massive workforce to build the altar.  Sub-altars will be built across various regions simultaneously. The Demon Sea and Canglang Sea are unclaimed – who will oversee them? If you can train a force of elite warriors, and we cooperate closely, do you think the Grand Master will entrust this task to someone else?"</p><p>"I understand now, thanks to your guidance, Gui!"</p><p>Black Lion King was deeply impressed.</p><p>"This is my insight on the altar. Gather some trusted elite officers and begin training them in this direction. We'll wait for the opportune moment."</p><p>Gui Hou produced a jade slip.</p><p>Black Lion King received it, cherishing it greatly.</p><p>"Black Lion, take care. I'm off!" Gui Hou vanished in a flash of light.</p><p>Gui Hou flew west, a smile playing on his lips.</p><p>He didn't understand why the Grand Master was unwilling to eliminate the threat completely or demote all demon cultivators to soldiers.</p><p>Since the Grand Master did this, there must be a reason. He considered that after the reclamation of the Demon Sea, even if the Grand Master released some demons, he would need someone trustworthy to oversee them.</p><p>Besides Luo Hou and himself, who else could be qualified?</p><p>If he could secure this task, he wouldn't be confined to the altar anymore.</p><p>Gui Hou’s eyes gleamed, hoping those fellows would make even more of a ruckus!</p><p>…</p><p>While Gui Hou sought out the Black Lion Saint King, the Golden Toad King entered the East Sea. After flying for a while over the vast ocean, he arrived before an island, revealed his form, and loudly called out, “Daoist Dragon Whale, are you there?”</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder, immediately causing an uproar.</p><p>Demonic energy soared from the island, where countless demon soldiers were stationed.  Accompanied by shouts and cries, squads of demon soldiers surged forth, their demonic energy swirling, their banners waving like a forest.</p><p>“Stand down!”</p><p>A stern voice echoed from within the island. The demon soldiers obeyed instantly, quickly retreating and clearing a path.</p><p>The Golden Toad King swept his sleeve and flew into the island, complaining, “Your Daoist palace is rather extensive, it took me quite a while to find you!”</p><p>“Golden Toad King, what brings you to my humble abode?” Dragon Whale Saint King asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“I’ve come to ask you for a rare medicinal herb.”</p><p>The Golden Toad King said bluntly.</p><p>In the center of the island, a magnificent golden palace occupied the entire mountain peak. Inside the palace, the Golden Toad King and the Dragon Whale Saint King sat on opposite sides of a giant golden table, attended by several beautiful fish maidens.</p><p>The overwhelming power of the two demon kings was terrifying. The fish maidens’ faces were tense, and they trembled in fear.</p><p>After clarifying the herb the Golden Toad King desired, the Dragon Whale Saint King nodded and summoned a subordinate.  “Go to the Yuan Luo Palace and retrieve this medicine. Deliver it to the Golden Toad King!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>The demon immediately departed.</p><p>The Golden Toad King sighed, “You are quite impressive, Daoist! Even a Saint King can issue commands so readily.”</p><p>After transforming into human form, the Dragon Whale Saint King stood nearly seven feet tall, wearing a golden crown. He was tall and powerfully built, with arms like iron bars, a chain wrapped around his right arm.  His giant, copper-bell eyes fixed on the Golden Toad King. “Golden Toad King, you’re not simply here for medicine, are you? What other purpose do you have?  Tell me everything.”</p><p>The Golden Toad King spread his hands. “I did indeed come for the herb. You dominate the East Sea, enjoying a carefree life, with countless treasures at your fingertips.  Our place, even before the Heavenly Tribulation, was barren, sandwiched between human territories, constantly watched. Finding a single rare herb is incredibly difficult.”</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint King's expression remained unchanged, clearly disbelieving his explanation.</p><p>The Golden Toad King paused, then smiled knowingly. “However, on my way here, I saw some interesting things…”</p><p>Seeing that the Dragon Whale Saint King didn't react, he didn’t get upset, and asked, “Did you hear about the Qing Yang Temple re-establishing its mountain gate?”</p><p>“I've heard something.”</p><p>Replied the Dragon Whale Saint King.</p><p>“You probably haven’t seen the Temple's protective mountain formation yet. It’s truly remarkable,” the Golden Toad King said with admiration, vividly describing what he had seen at the Qing Yang Temple.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint King listened quietly, finally giving a lukewarm appraisal. “That is the bearing of a renowned sect. Before, they were petty; every time I went to Lu Ye, I felt stifled.”</p><p>“While the spirit formation is powerful, it seems overly complex, demanding too much of the Qing Yang Temple's resources. From what Master Li said, the Glass Fairy likely won't emerge to assist. For the Qing Yang Temple to complete the formation alone will be no easy task. In my opinion, just the final step alone could take several years, even a decade or more, tying up the entire Temple.”</p><p>The Golden Toad King shook his head, not optimistic about the Qing Yang Temple. “Master Li claims to be gathering the strength of the entire sect, but after careful consideration, I think it's still not enough. They’ll likely need to call on external support.”</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint King looked deeply at the Golden Toad King, his eyelids lowered. “Establishing a mountain gate is a major event for a sect. The Qing Yang Temple's cautious approach is perfectly normal. As long as it doesn't lead to war with the Changyou Tribe and doesn't affect the overall situation, whatever the Qing Yang Temple does is none of my concern. Are you perhaps trying to refuse Master Li's proposal?”</p><p>The Golden Toad King watched the Dragon Whale Saint King's reaction, noticing his impassive expression, revealing nothing.  He muttered ‘old fox’ to himself, chuckled and said, “Daoist, you know that these matters are handled by the Jiao Long King, and I'm just a messenger. When the time comes, the Jiao Long King will discuss it with you.”</p><p>At this point, the Golden Toad King remembered something and complained,  “Shouldn't you leave a way to contact us in the Western Lands? Before, we could only send talismans, which is not only slow but risks delaying important matters. We're both demons, we should work together. I don't understand what you're worried about.”</p><p>The Dragon Whale Saint King nodded noncommittally.</p><p>The Golden Toad King couldn't fathom the Dragon Whale Saint King's thoughts, but he was used to it. Changing the subject, he talked about other things, with the Dragon Whale Saint King occasionally agreeing.</p><p>It was just ordinary conversation.</p><p>After a while, the Saint King who had gone to fetch the medicine returned.</p><p>The Golden Toad King put away the medicine and stood up. “Thank you for the medicine, Daoist. I need to return for seclusion and won’t disturb you further. Farewell!” (End)</p>
