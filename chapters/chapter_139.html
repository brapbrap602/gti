Chapter 132, Paper Crane

Inside the wooden hut.

She had cleaned with her spiritual power countless times, but the room still seemed to have another person's scent.

Fairy Chenyan, her attire put together, sat upright on a cushion with a portrait facing it—it was not that of Dongyang Bo.

本来, according to cultivation method requirements, she should immediately go into seclusion, and with the demonic cultivation and this person's Yuan Yang, trace a shred of opportunity for her breakthrough.

But she continued to sit there, her eyes lost, and that unfocused gaze fell onto the portrait, her expression rather strange. It was as if she was struggling with something, and finally, she murmured to the portrait, "Master, this disciple cultivates demonic arts, harming innocent people...did this disciple do wrong?"

The portrait was an inanimate object, so naturally, it could not give her an answer.

The wooden hut was deathly still.

After a moment, Fairy Chenyan suddenly sat up straight, her confusion dissipating, her expression resolute.

She abruptly unfurled her palm, and in her palm were a dozen silver needles that were as fine as hair.

'Hua!'

As Fairy Chenyan's palm moved, the silver needles abruptly dispersed. The silver needles had a cold, glinting light, and the needle tips emitted a bit of cold air, and the temperature of the wooden house fell abruptly by a few degrees.

These silver needles hung in midair, pointing straight at various acupoints on her body, the ones on her head the most.

Then, Fairy Chenyan's palm changed, sending out mysterious runes one after another onto the silver needles, and one could see the silver needles become increasingly translucent, the runes on them flowing, immeasurably profound.

''Xiu xiu...''

One silver needle after another landed on her body, piercing deeply into her acupoints. She did not change her expression, as if she did not feel the slightest pain. When the last silver needle landed on the top of her head, about to pierce her hundredth meeting point, Fairy Chenyan suddenly hesitated, as if recalling something.

The silver needle floated above her head, unable to penetrate further.

Fairy Chenyan flicked her finger, and a bit of spiritual power in front of her turned into a sheet of paper, and then that sheet of paper automatically folded into a paper crane.

Within the dark wooden hut, the paper crane fluttered its wings, scattering specks of starlight. It circled Fairy Chenyan as it flew, emitting a clear crane cry, as if expressing gratitude to its creator, extremely lively.

Seeing the mischievous paper crane, the always expressionless Fairy Chenyan suddenly broke into a smile, and reproachfully tapped the paper crane's head, silently whispering a few words in its ear.

After a moment, the paper crane nodded its origami head, and with a soft cry, flew out the window.

...

Shaohua Mountain's Peak.

The steep, lonely peak nearly pierced through the nine heavens, covered in snow.

The mountaintop was the place where Shaohua Mountain's spiritual veins gathered. The spiritual energy was extremely dense, but on the peak of the snowy mountain, there was only one cave, which was the Shaohua Mountain Nascent Soul Grandmaster, Dongyang Bo's, place for quiet cultivation.

Other than the howling wind that never stopped, there was no other noise on the mountaintop. The Shaohua Mountain disciples absolutely did not dare to come here and disturb their grandmaster.

Suddenly, from a distant part of the sky, a speck of starlight flew over. Within the starlight was a palm-sized paper crane, struggling to fly to that cave in the strong wind. The cave's door opened silently, and a big hand made of spiritual power summoned the paper crane in.

Within the cave.

Dongyang Bo crushed the paper crane, and chuckled mockingly.

...

Qin Sang had just walked out of the wooden hut when the scenery in front of him suddenly changed, and he was transported off the island without any ability to resist.

Then, he saw clouds rising from the island, and in the blink of an eye, they covered the entire island. Within the clouds, a profound light flashed, and finally, the entire island completely disappeared from Qin Sang's sight.

The original place was only endless water, with nothing to be seen. There was no trace of the island.

Qin Sang knew that the master of the island had opened the large formation, and this cave abode would be completely sealed off.

He saw his current appearance from the lake below his feet, and he was utterly dozens of years older than before. He could not help but have a bitter smile on his face.

Last night's spring light absolutely did not deserve to be described as charming. Right now, his deepest memory was only the helplessness and fear from the end, and the Yuan Qi within his body poured out like a collapsing dam. He could only watch helplessly, without any ability to resist.

Fortunately, the other party showed mercy, and when his jade liquid was about to be extinguished, he actively stopped, and in return, helped him seal his Yuan Yang and stabilize his jade cauldron.

His cultivation was in great peril, but there was still a chance to compensate for it.

Sensing the meager spiritual power remaining in his Qi sea, and the sense of weakness that was everywhere in his body, Qin Sang forcefully gathered his spiritual power. He was just about to activate the Flying Shuttle and find an uninhabited desolate island to refine the Nine Yang Dan.

At this moment, a silver light suddenly flashed before his eyes. The flying ship had appeared out of nowhere and was now hovering in front of him.
Qin Sang's expression flickered.
Last night, when he discovered that Taoist Ma Wu had been replaced by Immortal Morning Smoke, he realized that there must be something fishy going on. Even the Sect Leader didn't know the inside story. As the only person in the know, could he be silenced?
Immortal Morning Smoke was a high-level cultivator who was about to form a Nascent Soul. She could kill him with a flick of her finger. In the end, not only did she not kill him, she kept her word and didn't completely destroy his foundation.
If she wanted to silence him, she wouldn't have to go to such great lengths. Qin Sang felt slightly relieved, but he still didn't dare to risk his life. He had planned to find a place to take the Nine Yang Pill, stabilize his Qi Sea, and then return to his cave as quickly as possible, where he would go into secluded cultivation or simply flee far away, watching the situation from afar before making a decision.
However, he didn't expect the flying ship to be waiting outside the island. In his current state, he wouldn't be able to escape. He didn't have time to think.
He boarded the flying ship and returned to Mount Shaohua.
The flying ship dropped him off at the same cave as before and then left.
Sect Leader Yu was like a cat that had smelled fish. He flew over on his sword and was startled by the sight of Qin Sang's face. Anxiously, he said, "Junior Brother Qin, hurry up and refine the Nine Yang Pill!"
Qin Sang was suspicious. He glanced at Sect Leader Yu's face and saw that his expression didn't seem feigned. Only then did his heart relax. He didn't have the mood to exchange pleasantries. In a weak voice, he said, "Excuse me."
He then rushed into the cave, took out the Nine Yang Pill, and swallowed it.
As soon as the pill entered his stomach, it turned into a gentle stream of warmth that flowed from his throat to his Qi Sea. The depleted vital essence in his body was replenished by the Yang Qi of the Nine Yang Pill and was rapidly recovering. Strands of medicinal power flowed throughout his body, and the weakness that was present everywhere gradually improved.
As his vital essence recovered, his appearance naturally returned to how he looked in his youth.
The Qi Sea, which had been on the verge of collapse, also slowly began to circulate at this time. The spiritual energy in the cave was stirred and gathered around Qin Sang.
Sensing that his cultivation was slowly recovering, Qin Sang secretly sighed with relief.
He didn't feel any abnormalities in his Divine Soul, so it seemed that the Jade Buddha had helped him avoid the greatest hidden danger of the furnace cauldron. The only concern was that his cultivation, which had broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage with great difficulty, would decline.
Fortunately, the Nine Yang Pill didn't disappoint him. His Qi Sea recovered faster and faster until it was filled with spiritual power.
However, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.
The miracle he had been hoping for didn't happen. His Qi Sea was now more than 10% smaller than before.
If he couldn't recover it, he would always have 10% less spiritual power than cultivators of the same realm. This meant that when fighting cultivators of the same realm in the future, he could never get into a situation where he was comparing spiritual power.
