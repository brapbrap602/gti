<h1>Chapter 1480: The Perfected Glacial Soul Light (Supplementary Update)</h1><p>At this moment.</p><p>The swirling vortex formed by the jade-white profound light began to slow down.</p><p>Within the profound light.</p><p>Liuli, who had been trapped and unable to break free, merged her figure with her phoenix-shaped sword, piercing through layers of the profound light and bursting out with tremendous force.</p><p>Simultaneously, a strange power took advantage of the situation and began to spread.</p><p>The three snow pythons hidden within the python banner sensed this fluctuation and immediately felt an instinctual suppression, trembling with fear.</p><p>'Crack... crack...'</p><p>A layer of fine frost began to climb up the python banner, rapidly spreading across its surface.</p><p>Liuli had intentionally allowed herself to be trapped by the python banner.</p><p>She had already perfected the Glacial Soul Light, and with this divine ability alone, she could suppress the snow pythons. By striking unexpectedly, she could turn the tables on Shang Lu.</p><p>The prerequisite was that Qin Sang needed to engage Shang Lu for a while, giving Liuli the opportunity to act.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had adjusted the plan at the last moment.</p><p>Liuli was not using her full strength now. The power of the Glacial Soul Light was similar to when she had attacked Qin Sang before, yet she still managed to break through the jade-white profound light at an astonishing speed.</p><p>This was naturally the result of the combined efforts of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and the Glacial Soul Light!</p><p>Not only was Shang Lu caught off guard.</p><p>The guests were also left bewildered.</p><p>The python banner could be likened to a type of formation, and it indeed had weaknesses. However, they could not fathom how Liuli had made such an accurate judgment so quickly, leaving Shang Lu with no time to react.</p><p>Shang Lu had no time to ponder.</p><p>At this moment, the three snow pythons could no longer control the situation. He had to return to stabilize the python banner and suppress Liuli again before he could focus on battling Qin Sang.</p><p>"Move the Mountains!"</p><p>Shang Lu roared.</p><p>The jade ruler trembled violently, and mountain patterns appeared on all four sides, forming a complete mountain range when connected.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Shang Lu held nothing back. The jade ruler, having undergone a drastic transformation, surged with power, as if it now possessed the weight of a real mountain range, capable of suppressing all things.</p><p>Its might was terrifying, and its momentum even swifter.</p><p>In an instant, a shadow of the ruler appeared above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>This shadow was still the same size as the original ruler, but the mountain patterns within it became extremely clear, as if they had truly fused with the mountains, pressing down from the heavens.</p><p>The peaks of the Listening Snow Pavilion directly below began to tremble, and the lights in this area dimmed compared to those in the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang bore the brunt of the attack, clearly feeling an astonishing pressure descending upon him. The true essence within his body seemed to stagnate.</p><p>A small jade ruler, comparable to a mountain!</p><p>Having devised this plan with Liuli, Qin Sang was naturally prepared.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword was already in position.</p><p>The moment the jade ruler's shadow appeared, the Golden Sinking Sword surged upward against the pressure. Its sword light was dazzlingly brilliant, charging forward without hesitation, and it split into multiple sword rays mid-air.</p><p>This was the embryonic form of a sword formation, one that Green Bamboo had comprehended on his own. Unfortunately, it was still incomplete. Since Qin Sang already possessed the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, he had no intention of expending effort to create his own sword formation.</p><p>The "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture" had thus remained at this stage, with hopes pinned on future generations.</p><p>Seven sword rays transformed into seven towering pillars, firmly resisting the continuously descending shadow of the ruler.</p><p>Though the shadow was hindered, the pressure still descended, albeit weakened by the sword rays.</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, activating the third seal of the "Seven Masters Buddha Seal," the Revolving Altar Seal. His blood and qi surged, allowing him to shake off the pressure and drift away like a fish in water.</p><p>Then, without a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang lunged toward the python banner.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword rays shattered, and the ruler's shadow smashed into empty air.</p><p>After Qin Sang escaped, the Golden Sinking Sword immediately left the range of the ruler's shadow, unaffected. The sword then swiftly turned, not following its master, but instead thrusting directly at Shang Lu without any hesitation.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Around the arena, the guests were all tense.</p><p>No one had expected that what had been a relatively mild probing phase would suddenly escalate to this extent due to the disturbance with the python banner.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was the first to react. She pointed her jade finger downward, activating the Nine Forbidden Frosts.</p><p>A forbidden diagram appeared out of thin air, enveloping the continuously descending ruler's shadow and neutralizing it to prevent it from crashing into the ground and causing unnecessary casualties.</p><p>She looked at Qin Sang, her eyes sparkling with intrigue.</p><p>Among all the cultivators present, she was the most familiar with Qin Sang's strength. This man, wary of someone, clearly did not want to reveal his identity.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was quite curious to see what other methods Qin Sang had up his sleeve to resolve this situation.</p><p>On the other side, Hall Master Yin's eyes flickered as he also focused intently on the arena, showing no change in expression. Although Shang Lu seemed to be at a disadvantage, the outcome was still uncertain. It was unclear who would emerge victorious.</p><p>The python banner had become the center of the battlefield.</p><p>The three snow pythons were restless, frantically activating the python banner to resist the spreading Glacial Soul Light. In their distraction, Liuli, wielding her sword, charged outward, on the verge of breaking free from the jade-white profound light.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Shang Lu's figure flickered as he dashed through the air.</p><p>He no longer cared about his earlier boast of not attacking Liuli. Wielding the jade ruler, which had returned to its original form, he struck at Liuli from above.</p><p>At the same time, he quickly formed hand seals to stabilize the python banner and dispel the frost.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Liuli paid no heed to the jade ruler, her pure eyes fixed on Shang Lu. A deep azure light, far more intense than when she was on Chaos Demon Island, flashed in her eyes.</p><p>The Glacial Soul Light reappeared!</p><p>This time, Liuli held nothing back. For the first time since perfecting the Glacial Soul Light, she revealed it to the world!</p><p>'Clatter...'</p><p>In an instant, the guests all stood up, including the Grand Elder and Hall Master Yin.</p><p>Some overturned tables and jade cups without even noticing.</p><p>Their gazes shifted from Qin Sang and Shang Lu, unanimously landing on Liuli, their faces filled with astonishment.</p><p>Tong Lingyu glanced at Shi Xue, deep in thought, and murmured, "The Listening Snow Pavilion has finally produced a true genius."</p><p>Shi Xue nodded lightly, her face filled with pride.</p><p>The Listening Snow Pavilion's foremost true inheritanceâ€”the Glacial Soul Light.</p><p>This divine ability had once held great renown. The founder of the Listening Snow Pavilion had relied on this single ability to dominate the North Sea. However, the difficulty of mastering this technique was exceedingly high.</p><p>The Listening Snow Pavilion possessed a treasure trove, but its descendants had been unable to inherit it fully, leading to a gradual decline.</p><p>At most, disciples of the Listening Snow Pavilion could only reach a level close to perfection in the Glacial Soul Light. That final step seemed like an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>Over thousands of years, Liuli was the first to achieve this, and she did so at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Of course, only Liuli knew that her master, Bing Yao, was the true first.</p><p>After reaching perfection, the Glacial Soul Light became even more mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p>Shang Lu only sensed it the moment the divine light erupted.</p><p>The spectators outside the arena only noticed the change in the battlefield after observing Shang Lu's actions, deducing that Liuli had perfected this divine ability.</p><p>She had been feigning weakness to lure the enemy in.</p><p>No one had expected that this sparring match would ultimately turn into a duel between Liuli and Shang Lu, with the supposed main character, Daoist Qingfeng, becoming a mere spectator.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A burst of white light erupted from Shang Lu's chest, instantly illuminating the surroundings.</p><p>The source was a heart-protecting mirror-like treasure, capable of automatically protecting its master. It activated the moment the Glacial Soul Light struck.</p><p>A light mirror materialized in front of Shang Lu, but it was immediately engulfed by the Glacial Soul Light.</p><p>Taking advantage of this brief moment, Shang Lu hastily retreated in disarray.</p>
