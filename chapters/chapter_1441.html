<h1>Chapter 1433: The Seven-Teacher Buddha Seal</h1><p>Chapter 1433: The Seven-Teacher Buddha Seal</p><p>“Why was the Great Demon Assembly suddenly brought forward? When did you receive the news?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, his brows furrowing tightly.</p><p>In that instant, many thoughts flooded his mind.</p><p>Was the advancement of the Great Demon Assembly related to the Old Demon Hun Mo, and to the Jing Hai Sect?</p><p>If not, what was the real reason?</p><p>If it was a trap, why wasn't the assembly convened immediately after leaving the Jing Hai Sect? Why wait a year and a half before announcing the change in date?</p><p>Master Yin Quan sensed Qin Sang's suspicion.  “The news only surfaced recently; we can’t confirm it yet. However, the source is reliable, so it should be true.  Qin Daoist, please stay a few more days.  A list of some of the treasures will likely be sent. After all, there's only half a year left, and those far away will need travel time.”</p><p>Qin Sang moved his hand, storing the Hidden Fragrance Pill into his Qian Jun Ring.</p><p>Leaning back slightly, he asked quietly, “Has this ever happened before?”</p><p>Master Yin Quan pondered. “I’m from Dan Ding Mountain and only attended the Great Demon Assembly once. It's said that the interval between each assembly is just an approximation; the exact date is only confirmed shortly beforehand. The original rumor was seven years later, but it was never confirmed.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, tapping his fingers on the table, feigning thought. “Has anything significant happened recently in the Boundless Sea? I heard that Old Demon Hun Mo appeared in the Kong Ling Sea, and an ancient relic emerged.”</p><p>“I heard about that too, but it’s unlikely to be the cause. It was supposedly a relic of the [Name of Buddhist Sect], and not that ancient. The protective formation was destroyed before it could even be opened, due to a sudden eruption of raging flames. The Yuan Ying stage cultivators present were all in a sorry state, barely escaping death. The sect's treasures were swallowed by the flames, they only managed to salvage a small portion.  Even if there were Buddhist treasures or scriptures inside, they’d be of little value to us; it's unlikely to cause the Great Demon Assembly to be brought forward. Those Buddhist disciples might want them, but they can’t afford them.”</p><p>Master Yin Quan shook his head repeatedly, adding, “The history of the Great Demon Assembly is lost to time; it’s far older than Old Demon Hun Mo. Participants aren't limited to the Boundless Sea; it involves many parties. It's held on Hun Mo Island because a powerful cultivator acts as a deterrent. Old Demon Hun Mo can't dictate everything; various factions must negotiate to decide on a suitable time and rules.”</p><p>As Qin Sang suspected, Old Demon Hun Mo was a lone wolf, unable to dominate. Other forces wouldn't let him act arbitrarily and damage the credibility of the Great Demon Assembly.</p><p>Even if Old Demon Hun Mo wanted to do something, he couldn't be too obvious.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>At this moment, Master Yin Quan suddenly remembered something and smiled, “Instead of being related to the Buddhist relic, it’s more likely due to something else.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up.</p><p>Master Yin Quan said, “Huang Long Shi’s palace has appeared!”</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily confused.</p><p>Then he recalled hearing the name before. Huang Long Shi was the foremost cultivator in the Boundless Sea, generations before Old Demon Hun Mo.  Undeniably a powerful cultivator, he dominated the three northern regions.</p><p>Huang Long Shi’s palace emerged? How did I not know about this?</p><p>This is far more valuable than the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>It's said that Huang Long Shi was just a step away from the Nascent Divinity stage when he died trying to break through. His palace might contain his belongings.</p><p>Whether there are spiritual treasures is uncertain.</p><p>For example, notes on his breakthrough experience.</p><p>Or secret techniques to aid in reaching the Nascent Divinity stage.</p><p>Enough to make Yuan Ying cultivators eagerly pursue them.</p><p>“It happened a month ago. Details are still unclear. Rumor has it that Old Demon Hun Mo was involved. It’s said that several Yuan Ying stage cultivators from Xuan Tian Palace, along with some demons, discovered Huang Long Shi’s palace together. A great battle ensued, and the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators were slaughtered, including an elder.”</p><p>Master Yin Quan chuckled, “I suspect that Xuan Tian Palace discovered Huang Long Shi’s palace, and Old Demon Hun Mo seized it.”</p><p>That's the old demon's style.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded instinctively.</p><p>He sighed inwardly, this is the price of gain, isn’t it?</p><p>Because he offended Old Demon Hun Mo at the Jing Hai Sect, he deliberately reduced his outings.  If he'd received the news in time, he might have had a chance to get involved.</p><p>While the Spirit Lamp Flower, Wish-Fulfilling Pearl, and other objects were precious, Qin Sang would rather use them to exchange for secrets regarding the Nascent Divinity stage.</p><p>Huang Long Shi’s palace must have been looted clean by Old Demon Hun Mo.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the old demon wouldn't be willing to share anything with him.</p><p>Several Xuan Tian Palace Yuan Ying cultivators were killed.</p><p>Old Demon Hun Mo is truly unscrupulous and does as he pleases.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the ice box in his Qian Jun Ring. The Xuan Tian Palace elder personally led the search in the Boundless Sea, probably looking for the ice box. They unexpectedly discovered Huang Long Shi’s palace, only to meet their end.</p><p>“Xuan Tian Palace hasn't given up, but the ice box hasn’t shown any unusual activity.  I don't know if I haven't encountered them, or if the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire has successfully blocked their detection. Master Feng Shang said he would use this to plot against Bi Fang. I wonder if he's released the news yet?”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts drifted, connecting various events.</p><p>Master Yinquan, unconcerned, continued, "The Huanglong Imperial Palace appeared less than a month ago, and the Great Demon Conference was announced to be held earlier than scheduled.  Following your line of thought, perhaps the Old Demon Hunmo and those other old demons found something within, planning to make their move at the conference, or perhaps they urgently need to gather certain treasures..."</p><p>He paused abruptly, his expression changing.</p><p>They exchanged a look, the same thought dawning on them both—Could it be related to Ascension?</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled nervously, "Throughout countless years, the cultivation world has seen countless brilliant talents.  Ascension isn't so easily achieved."</p><p>If Old Demon Hunmo truly ascended, Qin Sang would have to consider finding a deep hole to hide in.</p><p>The forces of the Xuan Yue Realm and the Xuan Tian Palace certainly wouldn't want a Nascent Soul stage demon cultivator emerging from the North Sea.</p><p>They chatted for a while longer, reaching no conclusions. Qin Sang decided to stay a few more days, waiting for the treasure list.</p><p>News spread rapidly.</p><p>On the third day, Master Yinquan obtained the list.</p><p>"This is only a portion.  Everything except the top items can be purchased at the auction. To find out what the true treasures are, you must attend the final exchange at the Great Demon Conference."</p><p>Master Yinquan handed a jade slip to Qin Sang as he spoke.</p><p>The Great Demon Conference lasted ten days.  The climax would only arrive on the last day.</p><p>Qin Sang took the list, his eyes scanning the dense lines of text.</p><p>He immediately spotted several spiritual materials needed for the Ascending Spirit Ritual.  A quick glance showed that all but the three most crucial items could be obtained at the auction.</p><p>Quite the grand scale!</p><p>Materials to enhance the Jinchen Sword were also listed, but not the best. To obtain better ones, he'd have to wait for the exchange, a bartering session.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the top of the list, about to examine it closely, when he suddenly caught sight of a line—Seven Masters Buddha Seal, a Buddhist physical cultivation martial art.</p><p>No further details were provided.</p><p>The absence of this "Seven Masters Buddha Seal" from the auction, and its reservation for the final exchange, spoke volumes about its value.  </p><p>It must be a Yuan Ying level martial art!</p>
