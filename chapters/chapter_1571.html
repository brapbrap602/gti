<h1></h1><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>…...</p><p>Countless layers of earth shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang charged like a raging bull, smashing through everything in his path.</p><p>After this great battle, this entire area would likely collapse completely.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man and Qin Sang chased and fled, with the Grey-Robed Man trailing behind. He tried several times to unleash his poison techniques, but was unable to harm Qin Sang. He could only focus on manipulating the Five-Colored Venomous Spider, pursuing closely to help the Strange-Faced Man track Qin Sang's movements.</p><p>Wherever Qin Sang passed, sword energy crisscrossed, and a blizzard of snow descended.</p><p>Palm-sized snowflakes danced around him, and vines surged from all directions.  The seemingly delicate snowflakes effortlessly sliced through countless vines.</p><p>But this only temporarily alleviated the pressure; his situation hadn't improved.</p><p>Contrary to Qin Sang's expectations, the Strange-Faced Man only pursued relentlessly, without using more powerful divine abilities or magical treasures to obstruct or trap him.</p><p>This man's mastery of the Wood Dao was incredibly profound, the greatest Qin Sang had ever seen.  Just controlling the Wood Bead, such a simple attack, required Qin Sang's full strength to counter.</p><p>But the Wood Bead's power was still limited; the pressure it exerted on Qin Sang was far less than Yin Changsheng's Suspended Sword Tower.</p><p>Throughout this chase, the Strange-Faced Man hadn't deployed a pseudo-spirit treasure.</p><p>However, the Strange-Faced Man's Jade Beetle had incapacitated Lu Zhang in an instant. If nurtured to its full potential, it would likely be more terrifying than an ordinary pseudo-spirit treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if all cultivators from the Central Continent practiced secret techniques similar to the *Offering Essence Technique*.</p><p>Refining a natal magical treasure into a pseudo-spirit treasure, and gradually increasing its power, required a cultivator to expend time and energy, achieving results slowly.</p><p>This process inevitably encroached on the time spent cultivating other divine abilities.</p><p>Especially for a Grand Cultivator who had recently broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage, there were many things they could be doing, and they might not be willing to invest in this.</p><p>Perhaps, the Strange-Faced Man had given up other pursuits to nurture the Jade Beetle.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, analyzing his opponent based on the information he had gathered.</p><p>Since the Strange-Faced Man wasn't aggressively pressing his attack, Qin Sang didn't mind engaging in this chase, waiting for Lu Zhang to recover.</p><p>While escaping, Qin Sang tried various methods, deploying all the divine abilities he had learned throughout his life, most of which belonged to the Ice Dao.</p><p>Behind Qin Sang, ice explosions, ice walls, and ice mirrors appeared in a dazzling display, forming layers of obstacles.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang constantly shifted and changed directions, and even conjured Glacial Ice Illusions to try and confuse his opponent's judgment.</p><p>But Qin Sang quickly discovered that everything he did was futile. No matter what he did, the Strange-Faced Man could always accurately pinpoint his location, yet Qin Sang himself didn't feel like he was being locked onto by divine sense.</p><p>This detail reminded Qin Sang that before finding the Stone Toad, his opponent must have been tracking them for a long time, yet he and Lu Zhang had been completely unaware.</p><p>All signs indicated that the opponent had a way to monitor them from a distance and possessed acute sensory abilities even within the miasma.</p><p>In that case, trying to escape using the miasma might backfire!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>An ice wall collapsed.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man, riding a wave of vines, appeared behind him. Whether intentional or not, he always maintained a certain distance from Qin Sang, unhurried and relaxed, as if toying with his prey, enjoying the desperate expression on the prey's face as it approached its demise.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm and collected, secretly observing the Strange-Faced Man, but he couldn't discern anything unusual.</p><p>A layer of green light enveloped the Strange-Faced Man, blocking the poisonous miasma, suggesting that although he had cultivated a Gu King, he might not be proficient in poison techniques himself.</p><p>"Could it be the other guy?"</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Qin Sang as he thought of the Grey-Robed Man.</p><p>During the struggle for the Stone Toad, he had clashed with the Grey-Robed Man. The Grey-Robed Man's performance was more like that of a cultivator specializing in poison techniques.  Qin Sang also recalled that when the Treasure-Colored Bell's light shone on the Grey-Robed Man, it seemed to reveal a Five-Colored Venomous Spider.</p><p>Like the Jade Beetle, this Venomous Spider was also beyond his recognition, most likely artificially cultivated as well.</p><p>Qin Sang diverted a sliver of his attention amidst the chaos to observe the Grey-Robed Man behind the wave of vines.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly saw the Strange-Faced Man make a strange gesture.</p><p>He closed his eyes slightly, and the green light in his palm intensified. The Wood Bead gradually turned transparent until it became a mass of dense green light, which then shattered into countless light particles and exploded outwards.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart leaped, a sense of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>He watched as these green light particles scattered and drifted down, easily permeating any earth or stone they touched, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The next moment,</p><p>The surrounding area seemed to respond to some unseen signal, and the entire earth began to tremble violently.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself at the epicenter of the tremors.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the sounds of shattering came from all directions, countless sounds converging into a tide that rushed into Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>‘Rumble…...’</p><p>Qin Sang watched with his own eyes as vines burst through the stone walls, tearing them to pieces.</p><p>They couldn't even be called vines anymore;</p><p>They were thick as pythons, like the roots of ancient trees, densely packed.</p><p>Stone walls collapsed before his eyes, revealing a shocking sight.</p><p>The underground had been hollowed out, and at some point, countless vines had grown, sealing off Qin Sang's surroundings, leaving no gaps, making him and the Snow-Treading Divine Saber appear incredibly fragile.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man had been setting up this trap all along, until this moment, when he suddenly unleashed it.</p><p>His throat moved, and the Strange-Faced Man uttered in a low voice, "Withered Forest Prison!"</p><p>As soon as he spoke,</p><p>The vines abruptly stopped growing, even those about to entangle Qin Sang froze eerily in place. The luster on their surface rapidly faded, becoming withered and dry.</p><p>All the vines simultaneously lost their vitality.</p><p>The previous scene, though terrifying, had been vibrant with life.</p><p>Now, the air was filled with deathly energy.</p><p>The transformation between life and death was chilling.</p><p>As the word "Prison" echoed,</p><p>The vines withered and vanished like a dream, perhaps they had never truly existed. All that remained were wisps of black energy, reeking of decay.</p><p>Greyish-white energy intermingled, forming a black vortex above Qin Sang, spinning faster and faster, descending rapidly.</p><p>Upon contact with this energy,</p><p>Qin Sang's protective sword energy was dyed black.</p><p>Snowflakes turned black one by one, then melted silently, withering like the vines.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. He wielded the Snow-Treading Divine Saber, unleashing a full-powered sword energy slash. The sword energy tore through the air, piercing into the vortex. However, as it went deeper, it was corroded, eventually succumbing to the black energy and vanishing completely.</p><p>The black energy vortex shuddered and continued to close in.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand above his head, and his vital energy transformed into a gigantic hand, grasping the vortex, fingers tightening with force. The result, however, was a 'bang' as the vital energy was also dispersed.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's figure appeared above, the vine wave gone. He stood in mid-air, looking down at Qin Sang.</p><p>Only the black vortex was visible to the naked eye, Qin Sang's figure obscured, seemingly at the end of his rope.</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man caught up, a sneer curling his lips, offering flattery without hesitation. "Master's Withered Forest Prison is unleashed, this man is surely doomed!"</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's brow suddenly furrowed.</p><p>Immediately following, a monstrous roar, unlike any human sound, emanated from beneath the vortex.</p><p>The black energy vortex suddenly trembled, becoming stagnant. A crack appeared at its center, and a beam of pure blue, icy light pierced through.</p><p>A colossal creature faintly materialized below – a Horned Serpent.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Horned Serpent raised its head, opened its massive jaws, and a ball of icy flames formed in its throat. With a roar, it spewed forth the flames.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's expression finally changed. He quickly extended his deformed right hand, reaching towards the vortex.</p><p>Green light particles faintly appeared at the vortex's center, about to reform into the bead, but the icy flames had already crashed into it.</p><p>The crack, instead of shrinking, widened abruptly. More cracks spread, transforming in an instant into a sea of intertwined blue and black light.</p><p>The icy flames were unstoppable, not only shattering the Withered Forest Prison, but their momentum remained strong.</p><p>Waves surged at the center of the sea of light, shooting out a blue pillar of fire. The Horned Serpent's true form burst through the air, fangs and claws bared, lunging towards its enemies.</p><p>The frigid air far surpassed that of the Snow-Treading Divine Saber.</p><p>At this moment, both the Strange-Faced Man and his disciple felt as if their blood was freezing.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man bore the brunt of the attack. Without time to re-condense the Wood Bead, his right arm abruptly retracted, and a piece of rough, bark-like wood armor flew from his chest.</p><p>The wood armor vanished in a flash.</p><p>Simultaneously, subtle ripples spread through the surrounding void, faintly tinged with green. Then, the illusory image of a towering ancient tree materialized.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man was perfectly protected at the tree's center.</p><p>As the tree's image took form, the Horned Serpent attacked. Its tail lashed out, enveloped in icy flames, striking the ancient tree with tremendous force.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's body trembled violently, staggering backward.</p><p>The tree's image shook intensely, the wood armor flickering in and out of view. The armor was clearly a remarkable treasure; the seemingly fragile tree shadow possessed incredible defensive power. It crashed down with a resounding boom, yet it didn't break.</p><p>Below,</p><p>The Four Horned Serpent Seal floated before Qin Sang, one serpent missing from its knob.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky.</p><p>He had been forced to counterattack with his spirit treasure. Although it was unexpected, it wasn't the optimal time.</p><p>Knowing that this strike was unlikely to severely injure the Strange-Faced Man, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and his hand seals changed abruptly.</p><p>The Horned Serpent roared, abandoning its pursuit of the Strange-Faced Man, and turned towards the Grey-Robed Man.</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man, meeting the Horned Serpent's bronze bell-like eyes, felt a chill run down his spine, his face pale with terror.</p><p>Fortunately, his master had blocked the first attack. The Grey-Robed Man flicked his Venom Whip, wrapping it around himself, and unleashed his poison techniques with all his might, forming a five-colored barrier. The Horned Serpent arrived instantly.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The barrier dissipated.</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man fared even worse, groaning as he and his magical treasure were sent flying by the Horned Serpent's impact, coughing blood, his complexion ashen.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, fixated on a point in the void.</p><p>Disturbed by the fluctuations of the battle, the Five-Colored Venomous Spider, hidden within the miasma, finally revealed its aura.</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision. The Horned Serpent changed direction once more, lunging straight for the Five-Colored Venomous Spider.</p><p>Seeing this, the Grey-Robed Man was about to breathe a sigh of relief when a look of horror spread across his face.</p><p>The Five-Colored Venomous Spider was the culmination of his life's work, a Gu beast nurtured with his very essence.</p><p>His cultivation had been forcibly elevated by his master using secret techniques. Afterward, he had devoted himself entirely to assisting his master in refining the Gu King, having little opportunity to cultivate other divine abilities or magical treasures.</p><p>He hadn't noticed it against ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators, but when faced with Qin Sang, whose powers countered his poison techniques, he was left with few options, despite his high cultivation level.</p><p>If the Five-Colored Venomous Spider were destroyed, he would be crippled.</p><p>Qin Sang, based on the Grey-Robed Man's performance, had pinpointed this weakness. Coupled with his judgment that the opponent was tracking him through the spider, he unhesitatingly shifted his target.</p><p>In his panic, the Grey-Robed Man bit his tongue, spraying a cloud of blood mist.</p><p>The blood mist merged with the miasma.</p><p>Transparent threads materialized within the miasma, each connected at one end to the Five-Colored Venomous Spider, the other end extending into the unknown distance.</p><p>Before materializing, these threads were formless and intangible, extensions of the spider's power, forming an invisible net. It was through this net that they had been monitoring Qin Sang and Lu Zhang.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Just as it was about to be swallowed by the Horned Serpent, the Five-Colored Venomous Spider folded its eight legs together, its entire body shimmering with a glaze-like sheen, transforming into a puddle of venom that instantly merged with the threads.</p><p>The next moment,</p><p>One thread vibrated, the venom converging at the other end, and the Five-Colored Venomous Spider reformed there.</p><p>Where the spider had been, the Horned Serpent lunged at empty air.</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man breathed a sigh of relief, about to swoop down and retrieve it, when a cloud of white energy suddenly appeared before him. A giant hand formed of vital energy grabbed the Five-Colored Venomous Spider first.</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>As the vital energy hand was about to retract, a gust of wind struck.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man, having somehow retrieved the Wood Bead, struck directly.</p><p>This was a furious blow from the Strange-Faced Man. Although not as visually impressive as the Withered Forest Prison, the Wood Bead's innate power was almost as formidable. The vital energy hand trembled, threatening to dissipate.</p><p>Fortunately, the Horned Serpent arrived in time, leaping between the vital energy hand and the Wood Bead, taking the full force of the blow with its body.</p><p>With a 'bang', the Horned Serpent was knocked down, but its exterior showed no signs of injury. It danced around Qin Sang, lively and unharmed.</p><p>The Five-Colored Venomous Spider had landed in Qin Sang's hand, sealed within glacial ice.</p><p>Qin Sang toyed with the ice block, looking up at his opponent with a calm expression.</p><p>The two stood facing each other, one high, one low.</p><p>"A Spirit Treasure!"</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man took a deep breath, restraining his anxious disciple. "Truly, chaotic times are upon us, even Spirit Treasures have emerged!  I'd like to see how long your true essence can last!"</p><p>Qin Sang's lips curled into a faint, sly smile. "Why should this humble Daoist continue to tangle with you?"</p><p>His voice had barely faded when</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly placed down the Sitting Meditation Bell.</p><p>A resonant chime emanated from the bell, as if traversing a thousand mountains, distant and desolate. Then, the blue light surged, transforming into an enormous blue bell that enveloped Qin Sang entirely.</p><p>Seeing this,</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man knew something was wrong. The Wood Bead and Wood Armor combined, the ancient tree's image joined by countless vines, attempted to crush the blue bell, but were once again intercepted by the Horned Serpent.</p><p>In mere moments, amidst the chaos, the Horned Serpent vanished into thin air, along with the blue bell.</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man panicked. Not only had he failed to obtain the Stone Toad, but he had also lost his own Gu beast. He rushed down, but the Strange-Faced Man remained motionless.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>The Grey-Robed Man cried out urgently, only to see his master silent, looking down at his left hand.</p><p>He paused, his gaze shifting downwards, and he gasped sharply.</p><p>No wonder his master's left hand had remained clenched, without using the Jade Beetle.</p><p>A bloody hole gaped in the center of his master's palm, and the Jade Beetle was greedily devouring his flesh and blood, bone already visible.  Seeming to sense his gaze, the Jade Beetle lifted its small head, its eyes gleaming with bloodlust.</p><p>A green light enveloped the Jade Beetle, the Strange-Faced Man struggling to suppress it, with little success.</p><p>"Truly a wicked creature, extremely prone to backlash before reaching its full potential. I hadn't expected that even I would nearly lose control.  I was too careless, using it to kill the enemy in a moment of excitement."</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man sighed.</p>
