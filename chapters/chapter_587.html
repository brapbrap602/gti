Chapter 580: Mid-Stage Demonic Core

At this moment, the white light was very close.
Its demonic energy was useless against the white light.

The golden eagle saw two masked figures on the mountaintop ahead.  They were clearly human and their cultivation was low. One of them had a white orb floating before them.

Seeing the orb, the eagle felt a stronger sense of foreboding.  Startled, it violently flapped its wings, dodging to the right.

At that instant, it caught a glimpse of a dark figure—a grotesque, clawed demon—appearing beside it with incredible speed.

“Flying Night Rakshasa!”

The golden eagle cried out, its feathers bristling.  Normally, it wouldn't fear a mere Flying Night Rakshasa. But injured and facing the imminent white light, the demon's appearance was deadly.

It instantly changed direction, fleeing to the left.

Just as it was about to avoid the white light, it sensed something amiss.  Looking down, it saw countless vines erupting from the ground.

‘Whoosh whoosh whoosh…’

The vines shot into the air with frightening speed, ensnaring the eagle before it could react, forming a cage.

‘Bang!’

A loud bang echoed from within the cage as several vines snapped under the strain.  It wouldn't hold the eagle for long.

But then the white light descended, merging with the cage.  Silence fell within. The vines swiftly retracted, disappearing into the dense forest.

Two figures appeared at the edge of the woods.

Yun Youzi smiled, gazing at the quiet forest.  “The ancient restriction in this forest is no simple matter. It's fraught with danger. The golden eagle won't escape easily. Let it puzzle it out. Let's go!”

“Senior not only can break ancient restrictions, but also utilize them. I'm in awe!”

Qin Sang, having witnessed the entire battle, was deeply impressed by Yun Youzi.  He and the Flying Night Rakshasa had only briefly shown themselves; the entire ambush was orchestrated by Yun Youzi.

To subdue a demonic cultivator at the Demonic Core stage with only Foundation Establishment cultivation—few would believe it.

Yun Youzi modestly replied, “I merely borrowed the power of the ancient restriction. I didn't control it.”

…

With the golden eagle subdued, one threat was eliminated. But they didn't relax, continuing to break the restrictions, drawing closer to the Purple Cloud Fruit.

On the cliff, a waterfall cascaded down like a silken ribbon.  The scene was breathtaking.

Qin Sang looked up, feeling the lingering aura of a former fairyland.  He noticed Yun Youzi leap into the waterfall and quickly followed with the Flying Night Rakshasa.

Behind the waterfall, the rocks were slick from the water's relentless pounding, making it difficult to stand.

Qin Sang followed Yun Youzi upstream, eventually landing on a protruding rock, using all his spiritual energy to keep his footing.

Following Yun Youzi's gaze, Qin Sang examined the rocks, finding nothing unusual. He looked at Yun Youzi questioningly.

Yun Youzi activated the Immaculate Orb, floating it toward the rock face.  “There's a hidden cave within the rock wall.  There was an ancient restriction, reinforced later by the demon clan, making it extremely well hidden. Even if someone scans with their spiritual sense, they wouldn't find it.”

The orb drifted before a moss-covered stone, emitting white light that seeped into the rock.

To Qin Sang's astonishment, the stone shimmered, revealing a stone staircase leading into the wall.

“Let's go.”

Yun Youzi led the way.

The walls of the staircase glowed with green light, likely from a strange mineral or a manifestation of the ancient restriction.

Soon, they heard the sound of flowing water—an underground river.

Following the river, the space opened up. Further along, they arrived at a large stone chamber, seemingly naturally formed, not carved by human hands.

The chamber was the river's source, where the water formed an underground lake, causing the air to be very cold and damp.  The water was clear and still.


Qin Sang stopped at the entrance of the stone hall, her gaze drawn to a spirit tree across the lake.  Across the lake, in a small depression, a spirit tree grew from between the rocks. It wasn't tall, but its trunk was strong, its branches full and lush, resembling a plum tree. Several fruits hung from its branches, hidden amongst the leaves.  These fruits varied in size; the largest were as big as a man's fist, while the smallest were no bigger than longan fruit. The smaller fruits were green, clearly unripe. The largest one was entirely purple, adorned with intricate, deep red cloud patterns on its surface, giving it an air of mystery.

A strong fruity fragrance filled the stone hall, emanating from the fruits. This was the ripe Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, so named for its color and markings. This fruit could repair the damaged foundations of a cultivator, and was even more valuable to spirit beasts, its primary function being to help them refine their blood essence.  Refined blood essence meant faster cultivation.  This is why the spirit beasts of Tian Yao Qiu had entered the inner hall to compete for this fruit.

However, the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit only worked for spirit beasts below the Core Formation stage, and it grew slowly.  Only one or two ripened each time the Zi Wei Palace opened. This time, only one had ripened. The unripe fruits were useless.

Finally, Qin Sang had obtained the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!  Since her foundation was damaged during the Core Formation stage, almost a century ago, she had been struggling, her progress hampered.  Fortunately, she had obtained several treasures that mitigated the damage, keeping her strength comparable to cultivators of the same level.  But she longed to recover fully.  Now, with the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, excitement surged within her.

Qin Sang clenched her fist, nodded to Yun Youzi, and was about to fly over to pick the fruit when a mocking voice echoed from behind:  “Two human cultivators at the mere False Core stage, daring to covet our clan's spirit fruit? I am curious, how did you learn of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit's location?”

Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's faces fell, and they spun around.  At the entrance of the stone hall, a black panther emerged from the shadows, moving with silent grace.  Its elegance was unlike any uncivilized beast; it possessed the bearing of a human noble, surpassing even the finest in refinement—an absurdity.  Even more shocking was its unrestrained aura; it was a mid-Core Formation stage spirit beast!
