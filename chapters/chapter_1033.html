<h1>Chapter 1025 The Maiden</h1><p>Qin Sang stood on the mountaintop and was surprised to find a sheer cliff ahead.</p><p>The path ended!</p><p>A cliff wouldn't stop a cultivator. Qin Sang could easily fly across with his sword, but his instincts told him not to be so impulsive.</p><p>Deep within the dense fog, the mountain shadows were hazy, appearing both real and illusory.</p><p>There seemed to be mountain ranges, but they might not be real.  A rash action could lead him into a trap within the Thousand Mountains Formation, putting him in real danger.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly fluttered around Qin Sang, using its divine ability to observe the surroundings, but found nothing unusual.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang decided to retreat.</p><p>He descended the mountain, slaying several fierce beasts along the way. Reaching the bottom, he turned to face another, tangible peak, then without hesitation, he strode towards it.</p><p>Along the way, fierce beasts appeared frequently, similar to his experience on the previous mountain.</p><p>Upon reaching the summit, the same scene unfolded.</p><p>The path vanished.</p><p>After leaving the valley, the path split into three, two real and one illusory, but all were dead ends.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, surveying his surroundings, recalling his journey so far with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>It seemed that to get through, he needed to find the true path among the three mountains.</p><p>Those proficient in illusion formations would have an easier time.  Imperfect formations always had flaws. With some effort and careful analysis, one could find the way out or a weakness in the formation, minimizing the risk.</p><p>Cultivators unfamiliar with illusion formations, lacking the means to counter them, would likely have to rely on brute force.</p><p>Even with immense strength, one unafraid of the formation's traps would still be inefficient, wasting much time and energy on this trial.</p><p>“Fierce beasts appear and disappear unpredictably, and the real and illusory within the formation shift. Is the third mountain peak definitely an illusion?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>He returned to the foot of the mountains.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang noticed other changes in the illusion formation. The fierce beasts it generated were slightly stronger than before, indicating that the longer one stayed within the formation, the stronger the opponents became.</p><p>He quickened his pace, arriving at the foot of the third mountain.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly discerned that this mountain was illusory, but upon closer inspection, he found that within the illusion, there was reality.</p><p>After a brief hesitation, Qin Sang walked to a cliff face and took a step forward.</p><p>The wind whistled in his ears, the dense fog remained, but the surrounding scenery transformed. With a rustling sound, Qin Sang looked around and found himself in a dense forest, surrounded by towering ancient trees.</p><p>The jungle was dark and damp, and the strange roars of fierce beasts echoed in the distance.</p><p>This time, there was no path to guide him.</p><p>He had to find his own way out.</p><p>With the help of the Skyeye Butterfly's divine ability, Qin Sang observed for a while, chose a direction, and set off.  He changed directions several times along the way, ultimately finding the true path hidden within the illusion.</p><p>“With the Skyeye Butterfly's divine ability, navigating the Thousand Mountains Formation is far easier than for others."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of joy.</p><p>He immediately picked up his pace without hesitation.</p><p>The illusion formation wasn't static. Some areas had no fierce beasts, but concealed a variety of strange traps and mechanisms.</p><p>But with the Skyeye Butterfly and Qin Sang's own considerable strength, the various arrangements within the illusion formation posed little challenge, and his journey was remarkably smooth.</p><p>As time went on, Qin Sang gradually grasped some of the patterns of the illusion formation.</p><p>After all, for the sake of the Eighteen Demonic Banners, he had once dedicated himself to studying the Yuan Mirage Sect's "Fragments of the Grand Profound Formation," giving him some understanding of formation techniques.</p><p>Even without the Skyeye Butterfly, Qin Sang could deduce the path, but it would take considerably longer.</p><p>After traversing countless mountains and valleys,</p><p>Qin Sang emerged on a solitary peak, frowning as he gazed ahead, murmuring, "I wonder how much longer it will take to pass through this Thousand Mountains Formation.  The formation's power has grown stronger here, and even the Skyeye Butterfly is struggling, sometimes needing to observe for a while to determine what's real and what's not. It seems I can't be idle. I need to try and deduce the formation myself, to assist the Skyeye Butterfly…”</p><p>The echoing roars of beasts came from the distance.</p><p>Such sounds were common in the Thousand Mountains Formation, but Qin Sang seemed to sense something. His gaze sharpened, focusing on the direction of the roars, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>“Is someone fighting fierce beasts over there?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised that someone was faster than him, reaching this point earlier.</p><p>“The East Pole Alliance disciples can pinpoint the Maiden's location. Other factions probably have similar methods. These individuals are all elites among their peers, cooperating with each other, they certainly have an easier time than someone going solo. It seems I can't let my guard down."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, retracting his gaze, and continued down the mountain.</p><p>Deep within the mountains and forest,</p><p>A young woman was battling a fox-like beast.</p><p>However, this fox was the size of a calf, with sharp fangs and a ferocious demeanor.</p><p>The young woman was nimble, flitting like a colorful butterfly, waving her cloud sleeves, leaving trails of ethereal clouds in the air. The clouds seemed weightless, swirling around the girl and the beast, appearing harmless.</p><p>The beast sensed no danger, continuing its ferocious attack.</p><p>Two more clouds drifted from her sleeves.</p><p>They were now enveloped in a cloud of mist.</p><p>Suddenly, the young woman sprang back, retreating from the beast.</p><p>At the same time, her lips parted slightly, and she uttered a crisp command: "Bind!"</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>As soon as the words left her mouth, the clouds transformed, shedding their ethereal appearance. They became white threads, swiftly entangling the beast.</p><p>In an instant, the beast was bound like a dumpling.</p><p>The young woman's hand seals changed rapidly. A series of cracking bones and splattering blood echoed from within the clouds.</p><p>When the young woman dispersed the clouds, the beast was dead.</p><p>After slaying the beast, the young woman gasped, her face devoid of joy.</p><p>“My calculations are increasingly inaccurate. I haven't found the way out, and instead, I've stumbled into a trap. This time, I even encountered such a strong beast.  I don't know what lies ahead, but at this rate, I'll miss the opportunity…”</p><p>The young woman sighed, gently stroking the life talisman her grandfather had given her, anxiety etched on her face.</p><p>Just then, the young woman's ears twitched. She looked up sharply towards the depths of the forest, gripped the life talisman tightly, and with a flash, silently leaped into the nearby tree canopy, holding her breath.</p><p>“Someone's there?”</p><p>The young woman's expression turned serious.</p><p>The dense fog obscured her vision, but she could tell that the beast's roars were unusual.</p><p>She realized that the commotion she had caused while slaying the beast wasn't small and might have given her away.</p><p>Thinking of this, the young woman quickly moved away, deliberately putting distance between herself and the other presence.</p><p>But she soon discovered that the other person wasn't looking for her, instead heading straight in another direction at a rapid pace, almost without pausing.</p><p>The young woman was secretly surprised.</p><p>The other person's behavior was strange, as if they weren't making any calculations at all.</p><p>If the other person wasn't reckless, it was likely that they had a deep understanding of the Thousand Mountains Formation, able to see through the illusion at a glance.</p><p>Could someone who reached this point be reckless?</p><p>“Could he really be that powerful?”</p><p>The young woman was filled with uncertainty.  Then she noticed that the sounds in that direction suddenly ceased.</p>
