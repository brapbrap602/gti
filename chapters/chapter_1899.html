Chapter 1890: The Precious Proclamation of the Thunder Patriarch


Silver threads descended,
Stirring the Divine Court.
The azure heavens were pierced by the silver threads, and the Divine Court's barrier clearly couldn't withstand them. The cultivation of the person behind the silver threads was self-evident.
‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’
The fluctuations caused by the silver threads shook the Divine Court.
Whether it was the Three Enclosures and Four Symbols, the Twenty-Eight Mansions, or the Nine-Layered Thunder City, all the immortal mountains and divine halls trembled along with the Divine Court. Within the Divine Court, chaos reigned.
‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’
The tips of the silver threads swayed gently, whipping up gales and churning the clouds into a raging sea.
Kundao gazed up at the Nine Heavens, her expression incredibly solemn. Her jade hand flipped, summoning an ancient, simple incense burner.
The incense burner was engraved with the script of the Three Primordials and Eight Meetings, its exterior carved with auspicious beasts like phoenixes and qilins. The base of the burner was adorned with swirling cloud patterns, and two dragons coiled around it, their claws gripping the ground, supporting the incense burner.
The incense burner hung in the square of the altar, trembling slightly.
‘Dong!’
A resonant bell chime rang out.
On either side of Kundao, two Grand True Masters were in meditation, refining the alchemical power within their bodies. Startled by the sound, they opened their eyes and, seeing Kundao’s posture, immediately understood.  They quickly calmed their breaths, rose excitedly, and flashed behind Kundao.
They stood to her left and right, drawing their own flying swords, hands clasped respectfully, expressions solemn.
The other True Masters also summoned their flying swords, forming ranks behind the two Grand True Masters, maintaining silence.
Meanwhile, the bell chime reached the central altar of Zhongmao Province, and even all the altars within the two provinces' territories.
The altar masters of each altar led their disciples to stand solemnly before their respective altars, subconsciously holding their breaths.
The True Masters, still unaware of the celestial anomaly, were filled with excitement, quietly awaiting the True Monarch’s decree.
As expected, what followed would likely be the grandest and most significant Daoist ritual since the decline of the Dao Court.
The so-called rituals weren't a single act but referred to the practices of purification and invocation.
‘Purification’ meant cleansing.
The practice of purification originated in the ancient times of ignorance. Before worshipping Heaven, Earth, and the spirits, to show sincerity and reverence, one must first bathe and change clothes, abstain from alcohol and meat, and refrain from sexual activity.
Therefore, an ancient saying goes: Purification is the utmost clarity, only then can one communicate with the divine.
The Daoist sect initially absorbed the practice of purification and further developed it, evolving from the external form of sacrificial purification to the more important ‘heart purification,’ also known as ‘inner purification.’ It was believed that upholding precepts aided heart purification, thus giving birth to numerous Daoist precepts.
Purification is pure unity.
Precepts are solemn vigilance.
The Daoist sect considers purification and precepts as the foundation of its laws and the gateway to seeking truth. It believes that purification and precepts can reach Heaven and Earth, communicate with the divine, and benefit cultivation.
Later, as the Daoist sect deepened its understanding of Heaven, Earth, and the Great Dao, realizing that the spirits of Heaven, Earth, and ghosts existed only in legends, it deduced talisman spirits from talisman dao, created its own Divine Court, and evolved the purification practice, applying it to the art of summoning talisman spirits.
Talisman spirits are not spirits of Heaven, Earth, or ghosts.
Before performing the ritual, one need not be as reverent as in ancient sacrifices, meticulously completing the external purification, but one must perform heart purification, calming the mind and stabilizing the spirit.
The character ‘invocation’ also originated from ancient sacrificial practices, referring to the ritual of praying to the divine.
Invocation is the act of praying to and receiving blessings from the spirits of Heaven and Earth, much like ‘sacrifice.’
However, ‘sacrifice’ often used animal sacrifices as offerings.
When performing invocation, incense, flowers, lamps, candles, fruits, wine, tea, and soup are prepared, offered with reverence to Heaven and Earth, praying for blessings from the divine.
Purification and invocation have always been paired. Before performing invocation, one must purify.
The Daoist sect inherited this and bestowed new meaning, referring to the series of procedures of invoking talisman spirits, such as talismans,罡诀(gang jue - cosmic energy manipulation techniques), and incantations, as ‘invocation.’
The two are performed together, and now the term ‘ritual’ refers to Daoist rituals.
After the establishment of the Divine Court, Daoist cultivators rarely worshipped the spirits of Heaven, Earth, and ghosts, and Daoist rituals referred to the rituals of summoning talisman spirits.
The complexity of the ritual depended on the rank of the talisman spirit being summoned.
‘Swish!’
A stick of spiritual incense appeared in Kundao’s palm. She placed the incense into the burner. Smoke curled upwards, a fragrant aroma filling the air.
The smoke surrounded the True Masters, lingering for a long time.
Kundao pinched her fingers, sending a divine talisman into the incense burner.
The burner immediately emitted beams of precious light, which, combined with the fragrance, sprinkled upon the True Masters, light as water.
It was like being bathed in celestial water, washing away the filth of the mortal world, transforming their robes into pristine white.
This was the first step of the ritual, called the incense offering ceremony. For all matters of purification and cultivation, sincerity is conveyed through incense, beginning with lighting the incense.
The divine talisman Kundao used was an incense talisman, which, combined with the spiritual incense, was called the Bathing Incense Talisman.
The incense talisman not only brought about external changes for the True Masters but also cleansed their minds of distracting thoughts, purifying their hearts, and cleansing their spirits.
Kundao’s movements were swift, inserting various spiritual incenses into the burner, each accompanied by a different divine talisman.
She released fifteen incense offering talismans in succession.
Kundao sheathed her sword and stood still, and the other True Masters followed suit.
All the altars fell silent.
Including Kundao, the cultivators seemed clad in immortal garments, holding their flying swords, robes fluttering, their demeanor otherworldly.
At this moment, their minds were calm, their spirits tranquil, devoid of any distracting thoughts.
Kundao stood before the altar, her flying sword dancing. A divine talisman was formed in a single stroke.  Moving in accordance with the cosmic energy lines, she chanted aloud:

"Nine Heavens Golden Dragon, Talisman of Longevity.
Come before the Supreme Lord, roam in the Void.
Today I dispatch you, ascend to the Celestial Palace.
Swiftly, as decreed by the High Palace of the Divine Firmament!"

The True Masters behind her followed, chanting in unison, and the other altars did the same.
Beneath the night moon, within the Daoist territory,
Daoist cultivators stood before their altars, as if dancing with swords. Every step, every sword movement, was performed with precise method and rhythm, advancing and retreating with measured grace.
The incantations resonated through the immortal palaces.
A golden pillar of light suddenly erupted from the central altar of Baishi Province, shooting towards the heavens, its end unseen.
The next moment, a dragon's roar shook the heavens.
A golden dragon descended!
This dragon wasn't a true dragon but an illusory image, claws bared, teeth gnashing, its divine presence extraordinary, more majestic than the golden dragons that pulled the Celestial Chariot, more like a true dragon than the Great Sages of the demon race!
The golden dragon roared, diving downwards.
As the golden dragon was about to crash into the altar, Kundao’s expression remained unchanged.  She guided the dragon with her flying sword, and the golden dragon swished its tail, catching the divine talisman in its mouth, and returned to the sky.
At this moment, the Daoist cultivators at the altars controlled by the Dao Court, such as the central altar of Zhongmao Province, the Jing Altar, the Du Altar, and the branch altars, all heard the dragon's roar.
Golden light flickered in the sky.
Suddenly, a multitude of dragons appeared.
Countless golden dragons, wreathed in golden light, descended upon the mortal realm, rushing into the various altars.
Within the territories of the two Daoist provinces, golden light filled the sky, clearly visible from beyond their borders.
It wasn't over.
Kundao released another talisman.
"Decree of the Divine Firmament, proclaimed to all Heavens.
Relay dragons transmit the command, accept the talisman and receive the decree.
Swiftly, as decreed by the High Palace of the Divine Firmament!"

With the incantation complete, dragon roars resounded through the two Daoist provinces again, though they lacked the previous might and grandeur.
Specks of golden light rained down from the sky.
Within each speck of golden light was a golden-scaled flood dragon. The flood dragons carried decrees, rushing towards the ancestral altars of the various Daoist sects.
"Summon the celestial horses, deliver the talismanic edicts.
With utmost speed, they shall arrive in an instant.
Swiftly, as decreed by the High Palace of the Divine Firmament!"

The decree was issued again, and this time, Kundao pointed her flying sword towards the east.
…
Jushan Province.
Many sects that weren't part of the Daoist sect had either sealed their mountains to avoid disaster or sent out their elite disciples to slay the beasts, leaving only a few cultivators guarding their mountain gates.
It was a time of turmoil.
Most cultivators were gathered before their respective grand halls, and some of the more vigilant ones had already activated their altars, awaiting the True Monarch’s decree.
At this time, those cultivators in higher positions within these sects could see the astonishing celestial phenomenon of golden light connecting to the heavens in the west.
All the cultivators were awestruck by the spectacle created by Kundao’s ritual.
This was the power of a True Monarch!
This was the foundation of the Daoist sect!
Suddenly, the cultivators felt something and looked up at the sky, seeing golden light descending upon them.
Within the golden light was clearly a celestial horse, incredibly divine and majestic, carrying a decree in its mouth. Under the watchful eyes of all, it transformed into a stream of light and rushed into the altar.
In an instant, those at the main altars of the various sects understood the contents of the decree and immediately began the ritual according to the instructions.
The altars of Zhongmao Province, Baishi Province, and Jushan Province were all mobilized by Kundao.
Vast golden light illuminated Heaven and Earth.
At this moment, between Heaven and Earth, it was as if an immense Celestial Altar had been formed, comprised of numerous smaller altars.
Kundao was the one presiding over the main altar.
But, this wasn't enough!
"Crimson script on jade characters, reverently obey and carry out the teachings.
Proclaim to all True Masters, inspect and swiftly present.
Fly and transmit, without ceasing wind or fire.
Swiftly, as decreed by the High Palace of the Divine Firmament!"

With the command issued, golden light suddenly danced within the three provinces, countless and densely packed.
Countless golden lights, like fireflies under the night sky, danced with the wind, the vast majority flying towards the battlefields in the north and south, as fast as lightning.
On the battlefields.
Cultivators were battling the beast horde.
Suddenly, they saw the wind and fire messengers.
Those who received the decree immediately retreated, bowed remotely towards the central altar of Baishi Province, and placed the decree into their portable altars.
They then drew their flying swords, standing ready.
The portable altars immediately emitted golden light, connecting with the Celestial Altar.
Kundao’s action was to establish the Four Divine Relays of the Daoist sect.
The Daoist scriptures noted: To establish a Celestial Altar, one must first establish four relay courts.  Talismanic decrees and edicts are transmitted like postal stations in the mortal realm.
The Four Divine Relays were the Golden Dragon Relay, the Flood Dragon Relay, the Celestial Horse Relay, and the Wind and Fire Relay, each with different targets.
Establishing the Divine Relays also required the power of the Divine Court. Each relay had divine officials in charge, descending according to the decree.
The purpose was to unify the power of the Daoist sect, perform the ritual, and transform Heaven and Earth into a Celestial Altar!
Kundao, along with the incense burner, ascended into the sky, standing on the altar. She took another stick of spiritual incense and inserted it into the burner.
"Incense arises from sincere hearts, smoke comes from faith.
With sincerity, one reaches the Celestial Realm, and the True Ones descend to the Jade Steps!"
Kundao raised her beautiful head, her gaze following a wisp of incense smoke as it slowly ascended to the Nine Heavens.
The incense smoke passed through the barrier of the Divine Court, through the sea of clouds and immortal mountains, and entered the Thunder City, soaring up through the Nine Heavens and Nine Layers, reaching the eighth layer of the Thunder City!
On this layer, there was only one divine hall, dedicated to the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transforming Celestial Venerable!
Kundao continued to offer several types of spiritual incense, her sword dancing and talisman formation accelerating.
"Dao Incense, Virtue Incense, Wuwei Incense, Wuwei Pure Natural Incense.
Mysterious Grotto True Incense, Numinous Treasure Wisdom Incense, Transcending Three Realms Incense, Three Sticks of True Incense…
Incense clouds swirling, offered to the heavens."
As each stick of incense was inserted into the burner,
The other cultivators closed their eyes, sensing the Celestial Altar, moving their swords and chanting the "Incense Prayer" in unison.
The incense clouds grew thicker, reaching the Thunder Patriarch's hall!
Kundao softly chanted:
"Primordial One, Venerable One, King of the Thirty-Six Heavens of the Jade Clarity."
The cultivators responded:  "Thunder Sound Universal Transforming Celestial Venerable!"
Kundao chanted again:
"The Jade Pivot hangs over the world, the gate to eternal longevity.
The Golden Script is in the heavens, the secret of the Supreme Lord's flawless scripture!"
The cultivators responded: "Thunder Sound Universal Transforming Celestial Venerable!"
…
Each chanted word ascended to the Nine Heavens.
With each word of the incantation, Kundao released a talisman.
This was the most crucial part of the ritual - the petition.
On the eighth layer of the Thunder City, the demon gods stared at the Thunder Patriarch’s hall, radiating with lightning, terrified.
As the ritual progressed, the Thunder Patriarch’s hall resonated with the mortal realm, transforming into a thunder hall.
‘Crack!’
‘Rumble!’
Lightning filled the eighth layer, emanating a terrifying aura, as if a single heavenly thunderbolt could reduce them to ashes.
And what made the demon gods even more fearful was that, with the silver threads invading the Divine Court, a dreadful pressure descended from the heavens.
At this moment, the demon gods felt their insignificance, like mere ants.
Finally, the ritual was nearing completion.
All the cultivators at the Celestial Altar felt immense pressure, their arms trembling as they gripped their flying swords.
Kundao released the final divine talisman, took a deep breath, and suddenly raised her sword towards the sky.
The cultivators received the command, and with all their strength, together with Kundao, they chanted aloud:

"Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Palace, Supreme King of the Jade Clarity.
Transforming and filling the ten directions, discussing the Dao and sitting upon the nine winds.
Above the thirty-six heavens, perusing the precious texts, examining the jade books.
Fifteen hundred kalpas ago, holding true position, wielding great transforming power.
Holding the Golden Light Ru-Yi, proclaiming the Jade Pivot Treasure Scripture.
Those who disobey turn to dust, commands swift as wind and fire.
With a tranquil heart and grand vows, with wisdom and power subduing all demons.
Commanding the Five Thunders, governing the Three Realms.
Father of all beings, master of all spirits.
Great Sage, Great Compassionate, Supreme Emperor, Supreme Dao.
Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transforming Celestial Venerable!"

The chanting resounded throughout Heaven and Earth, shaking the Three Realms.
Kundao had established the Celestial Altar, summoning the talisman spirit, the Thunder Patriarch, the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transforming Celestial Venerable!
The chant recited by everyone was called the "Precious Proclamation of the Thunder Patriarch".
The Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transforming Celestial Venerable was of the Cave True rank, equivalent to a Daoist Celestial Master.  The summoning incantations for talisman spirits of this rank and above were honored as "Precious Proclamations"!
Within the Thunder Patriarch’s hall, the chanting of the "Precious Proclamation of the Thunder Patriarch" faintly echoed, growing louder, as if countless cultivators were chanting within the hall.
The talisman spirit responded.
The thunder hall erupted with blinding lightning, and a shadowy figure slowly emerged from above the hall.
At the heart of the lightning was a divine statue, clad in thunder robes, in a majestic pose, its left hand holding a thunder drum, its right hand pushing a cone, as if about to strike.
Its appearance was difficult to discern, as if its entire body were composed of thunder and lightning, its majesty awe-inspiring!
The demon gods didn't dare to even glance at the Thunder Patriarch, completely forgetting the Great Sage’s orders. They had already revealed their true forms, prostrating themselves, trembling, their faces filled with terror.
If anyone were to gaze at the Thunder Patriarch, they would see that the lightning coursing over the statue’s body resembled cracks, wounds on the statue.
Some had already healed, while others remained prominent.
However, this didn't diminish the Thunder Patriarch's overwhelming power.
At this moment,
The silver threads had successfully pierced through the Divine Court's barrier, hanging down, their tips swaying gently, as if searching for their target.
Qin Sang and the two demon kings pursuing him had also noticed the celestial phenomenon. Before they could understand what was happening, they felt a powerful aura erupting from the Thunder City.
The Azure Scale Demon King and the Black Roc both changed color, abruptly stopping.  Ignoring their pursuit of Qin Sang, they turned sharply to look at the Thunder City, the ferocity in their eyes replaced by deep fear.
Qin Sang abruptly stood up from the jade throne, gazing at the lightning flashing atop the clouds.
For some reason, the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal within his portable altar stirred.  Faintly, Qin Sang sensed a hint of familiarity within the lightning.
This wasn't an illusion; the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal’s stirrings intensified.
Qin Sang's expression changed.  It seemed that something significant was about to happen to him!
‘Crack!’ A deafening thunderclap!
Lightning illuminated the sky.
Qin Sang's eyes widened. He seemed to see a thunder god, embodying lightning, descending from the Nine Heavens, striking directly towards him!
