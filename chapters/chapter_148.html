<h1>Chapter 141: Three Years</h1><p>Once at the Xuanyin Sect, Qin Sang had experienced the agony of a wounded primordial spirit, but it was nothing compared to today.</p><p>As he urged the Ebonywood Sword into his primordial spirit, he promptly fell unconscious.</p><p>An unknown amount of time later, Qin Sang woke up. Like a corpse, he lay motionless on the ground, his blurred eyes glancing at the cave’s dome before slowly closing again.</p><p>He waited for a long while before regaining some of his strength. Silently, he reached for the jade bottle beside him, took out a pill for healing injuries, and swallowed it. Cautiously, he circulated his cultivation technique to treat his injuries and restore his primordial spirit.</p><p>After several days, his primordial spirit’s injuries improved, and he continued the same process.</p><p>Three years passed in this way.</p><p>During these three years, aside from visiting Huilong Temple every month to check for any summoning orders from the sect—lest he miss out on sect-assigned tasks and be punished—and heading to the capital city of Guguo to devour several trays of meat buns to satisfy his desire for food, Qin Sang continued his seclusion in his cave, single-mindedly cultivating the Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit Chapter.</p><p>Hard work pays off. One year after cultivating the Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit Chapter, this technique that he had once deemed impossible to cultivate showed signs of gradual progress.</p><p>The Ebonywood Sword began to show signs of fusion with his primordial spirit.</p><p>The spirit sword and the primordial spirit were fusing.</p><p>Next was the process of Qin Sang’s body resisting the sword qi erosion in his primordial spirit. He endured the pain of the sword qi erosion at all times. It took him a full two years to adapt before he could successfully enter meditation in this state.</p><p>The cave was deathly silent and exceptionally dark.</p><p>Only at the spirit spring did the Nine Illusions Orchid, which had fully recovered, shine with its beautiful light. Two years ago, mist had appeared above the flower’s pistil, and it incessantly changed into various illusions, each incredibly vivid and astounding.</p><p>“Whew!”</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from meditation, letting out a long breath of air, a look of joy on his face.</p><p>This was the second time he had successfully entered meditation; the first time—just five days ago—had been more of an accident.</p><p>Although he had already adapted to the pain in his primordial spirit, entering meditation was still difficult. Nevertheless, Qin Sang kept in mind Master Jixin’s teachings to stay calm and patient, not rushing things. After every failure, he would silently recite the Scripture of Tranquility to stabilize his thoughts, and then he would continue his attempts until he succeeded once again.</p><p>When he was unable to enter meditation, he could only try to sleep to replenish his energy. It had taken him a long time to be able to fall asleep peacefully. In the process, he had grown quite haggard and wasted a great deal of cultivation time. But now, he would no longer have to worry about this.</p><p>Qin Sang placed his ten fingers on his forehead and pressed for a while; this had become a habit of his. The pain from his primordial spirit was even more bothersome than the migraines he had suffered in his previous life.</p><p>Later, he had come up with a way to keep himself busy so he wouldn’t have any free time. Out of the twelve hours in a day, aside from his brief periods of sleep and time spent cultivating the Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit Chapter, everything else was filled with various chores. The majority of these chores were devoted to practicing the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword and the Spirit Hiding Art, and he achieved remarkable results.</p><p>After pressing for a while, Qin Sang stood up from the ground and ambled towards the spirit spring. He gazed in fascination at the Nine Illusions Orchid for a moment before turning his attention to the pool below.</p><p>Compared to three years ago, the spirit spring’s eye was clearly much larger, and the flow of water was far greater. Now, the entire pool had small half of it filled with spring water, and the Nine Illusions Orchid’s roots had once again formed a ball, brimming with life.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know how long it would take for this spirit spring to fully form, but at this rate, it wouldn’t be too long.</p><p>Once the spirit spring was complete, he would move the spirit spring and the cave to a more concealed spiritual vein so he could rest assured in leaving the Nine Illusions Orchid to grow in his cave.</p><p>Otherwise, he would need to pull out the Nine Illusions Orchid every time he went on a long journey. Even if he replanted it immediately, he would need to wait a year before it could continue growing, and he would have even less hope of seeing it mature.</p><p>Today was the end of the month again. Qin Sang sealed the cave, took flight in his flying shuttle, and arrived at Huilong Temple.</p><p>At Huilong Temple, he set up a simple Illusionary Formation, which could only obstruct mortals. Ever since the days of Master and Disciple Tiannan, Huilong Temple had not had the slightest bit of人气, and in just a few short years, it had become extraordinarily dilapidated.</p><p>Qin Sang landed in the living room, his expression stirring. He saw a sound transmission talisman acting like a headless fly as it rampaged around the barrier. Reaching out, he captured it and discovered that it was not a summoning order from the sect, but a message from someone named Yu Daiyue.</p><p>This person claimed to be a fellow sect Elder Brother and invited Qin Sang to join him in exploring an ancient cultivator’s ruins in the Yuncang Great Marsh. Details to be discussed in person; his tone was quite sincere.</p><p>Qin Sang searched his memories, but he couldn’t recall knowing any Foundation Establishment cultivator by the name of Yu Daiyue.</p><p>Since his breakthrough, besides Sect Master Yu, Senior Brother Wen, and Senior Brother Gong, Qin Sang had never come into contact with any other Foundation Establishment cultivators. After obtaining the Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter, he went into seclusion for three years, and didn't even return to the sect. He couldn't be any more low-key. He had no idea why these people would look for him.</p><p>The vast and boundless Yun Cong Misty Marsh was rarely visited by people.</p><p>It was said to contain numerous ancient cultivation ruins that had never been discovered, many of which contained priceless treasures. Rumors of someone making a fortune circulated from time to time, their truth difficult to discern.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently in the crucial stage of cultivating the Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter, and had no interest in exploring the ruins. He thus left a polite refusal note, then conveyed it down the mountain, and after eating a few meat buns, returned to his cave abode.</p><p>Another two months passed, and Qin Sang finally managed to free himself entirely from the influence of the sword mana devouring his soul, and could enter meditation at will. Now, he could move on to contemplating the killing talisman, drawing the intent to kill into his Nascent Soul to sanctify his spirit sword!</p><p>The first killing talisman in the cultivation technique was far less violent than the four following it. In addition, Qin Sang had already rehearsed it countless times over the past three years. It could be said that everything was prepared, only owing the east wind.</p><p>His divine sense reached into the cultivation technique in his mind, and instantly contemplated the first killing talisman of the Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind calmed, and a "hong" resounded through his mind. Only this killing talisman remained.</p><p>Every single stroke of the killing talisman had been written by a sword of slaughter, transforming monstrous killing intent into the tip of the pen. Qin Sang skimmed over them one by one, with a dry mouth and shocked mind. It was as though he were watching a peerless swordsman wielding his sword to slaughter all living beings in the world.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang's chest swelled with killing intent, as though he had transformed into this swordsman, and the world was his enemy. He couldn't control himself, and almost wanted to raise a sharp sword and cut everything apart.</p><p>Every ten steps, he killed a man, and for a thousand li, he left no trace!</p><p>Fortunately, the jade Buddha constantly stabilized his mind, preventing it from losing itself in the killing talisman.</p><p>Contemplating the Nascent Soul, comprehending the way of slaughter.</p><p>As time passed, the ebony sword dwelling in his Nascent Soul suddenly began to move irregularly.</p><p>Over the past three years, Qin Sang had carved countless talismans on the sword body. When he began to contemplate the killing talisman, these talismans, along with the Nascent Soul, would transform into a furnace, and, with killing intent, forge the sword!</p><p>As his contemplation continued, killing intent intruded upon his Nascent Soul and covered the spirit sword.</p><p>In an instant, the talismans lit up with a blinding light. A crisp "ka" sounded, and a crack barely visible to the naked eye appeared at the end of the sword's hilt. This wasn't where the body of the magic treasure fragment was located, but rather the weakest point on the ebony sword.</p><p>The ebony sword trembled violently, seemingly wailing.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly broke free from his meditation, sweat drenching his body, and his face pale with fear. He had been forced out of meditation by the intense pain from his Nascent Soul.</p>
