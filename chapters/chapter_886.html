<h1>Chapter 878:  A Masterful Performance</h1><p>“I have dual spiritual roots!”</p><p>Fang Ting raised her hand high, bouncing to the front of the crowd amidst gasps of surprise and envy.  She looked at the cultivator surnamed Chen, her face filled with excitement.</p><p>At that moment, she received a voice transmission and quickly swallowed the “Master” she was about to utter.  She formally bowed and said, “Senior, my name is Fang Ting. I possess water and earth dual spiritual roots. Please examine me.”</p><p>The onlookers couldn't help but mutter suspicions.</p><p>The girl's acting was simply too poor.</p><p>The two clearly knew each other, and it was likely she had already been accepted as a disciple.</p><p>However, no one minded. She had dual spiritual roots; even the Lan Dou Sect would accept her directly without testing.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Chen smiled and nodded. “Indeed, dual spiritual roots. Come up. The rest of you can proceed to the cloud bridge. Remember to perform well.”</p><p>He beckoned Fang Ting to his side and turned to leave.</p><p>Fang Ting’s lips moved slightly, seemingly whispering something.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Chen paused, his gaze shifting to the transformed being. His expression remained unchanged, and without a word, he took Fang Ting back to the island.</p><p>Fang Ting pouted slightly, giving the transformed being a helpless look before departing.</p><p>The transformed being chuckled wryly. He knew Fang Ting was talented, but he hadn't expected her connection to a Golden Core cultivator from the Yan Miao Pavilion. He regretted getting close to her.</p><p>Mentioning herself to the cultivator surnamed Chen, perhaps out of good intentions, could be both a blessing and a curse for him.</p><p>He knew that with such brief contact, Fang Ting couldn't possibly have any feelings for him.</p><p>But if the cultivator surnamed Chen valued her greatly and decided to eliminate anything that might hinder her cultivation, removing him in the process, that would be a terrible injustice.</p><p>The transformed being could only take things one step at a time.</p><p>After the cultivator surnamed Chen left, the three remaining cultivators continued preparing the cloud bridge. The man in green robes began testing the aptitude and age of the remaining cultivators, eventually selecting over thirty.</p><p>“Several friends, you don’t meet the requirements of our Yan Miao Pavilion. Please leave.”</p><p>These individuals all possessed four or five spiritual roots and were already quite old, yet stuck at the sixth level of the Qi Condensation stage. Their faces fell. They knew their chances were slim; they had come to try their luck, but were dismissed before the test even began.</p><p>The cloud bridge was soon ready.  They were simply told to walk across without stopping and to refrain from using any magical artifacts before being urged to proceed.</p><p>The crowd looked at each other.</p><p>No one knew what trials awaited on the cloud bridge, and no one wanted to go first.</p><p>Then, the transformed being stepped forward, calmly gazing at the cloud bridge, and without hesitation, walked towards it.</p><p>The four cultivators from the Yan Miao Pavilion exchanged glances. The sword cultivator subtly nodded, showing appreciation.</p><p>Seeing this, the others suddenly realized their folly. The sword cultivator had already made it clear that the test didn't necessarily require them to pass.</p><p>Daring to be the first showed courage, instantly making an impression on the Yan Miao Pavilion cultivators and gaining an advantage.</p><p>Trials were everywhere.</p><p>The others no longer hesitated and rushed onto the bridge.</p><p>The transformed being walked at the front. The cloud beneath his feet was soft and springy, but he still needed to use spiritual energy to stand. Initially, nothing unusual happened, but after a few steps, he felt a strange wind blowing from both sides of the bridge.</p><p>At the same time, the scenery changed.</p><p>Both ends of the cloud bridge vanished, leaving only the crowd and an endless white bridge, stretching towards the horizon. The lake below seemed to extend infinitely, its surface shimmering and bottomless.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly remained asleep. The transformed being was unsure if a Nascent Soul cultivator was watching and didn’t dare wake it.</p><p>From the cloud bridge’s creation, the Celestial Eye Butterfly had sensed it was an extension of the Lake Heart Island's array.</p><p>The transformed being calmly watched the changes, his face showing no alarm.</p><p>If the cloud bridge tested strength, his ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivation was enough to handle most changes. If it tested his temperament or perseverance, he had nothing to worry about; he only had to avoid being overly dramatic.</p><p>As he continued, the wind grew stronger, requiring him to use spiritual energy to protect himself.</p><p>The transformed being intentionally slowed his pace.  Others caught up and overtook him without hesitation.  He steadily moved forward, using spiritual energy to protect himself while subtly observing the changes in those ahead.</p><p>The illusion on the Cloud Bridge wouldn't be too powerful. If it's a test of willpower, perhaps with a little help from the jade Buddha, he could be immune. It all depends on his acting.</p><p>As they proceeded, the wind grew stronger, whipping at them like a lash.</p><p>Everyone slowed their pace.</p><p>Meanwhile, something was subtly changing underwater.  It felt as if something was luring them, whispering again and again, "Jump! Jump!"</p><p>The end of the Cloud Bridge remained unseen, its length inducing despair. The distance between them grew, until they could no longer see each other.  Soon, they would only see themselves, alone on the bridge.</p><p>These changes subtly affected their minds.</p><p>This Cloud Bridge was a double test of willpower and ability.</p><p>Someone suddenly realized, "This isn't a Cloud Bridge at all! It's using some power from the  Lan Dou Men's Path of Self-Reflection."</p><p>Suddenly, a boy screamed, clutching his head, his face contorting in agony. He lost his footing and fell.</p><p>Everyone was startled, watching as he plummeted towards the water. Then, a spiritual sword appeared, catching him and whisking him away.</p><p>At the dock, four cultivators watched the bridge.</p><p>"Such poor willpower?" the sword cultivator frowned.</p><p>A man in green robes said, "He's a three-spirit-root cultivator, only fifteen years old."</p><p>A middle-aged cultivator nodded slightly. "He has potential, but needs tempering. Send him to the Casting Hall."</p><p>The spiritual sword returned with the boy. The sword cultivator pointed to the left.</p><p>The boy, exhausted and shaken, sat dejectedly, recovering, unaware of his fate.</p><p>Starting with the boy, more and more people fell from the bridge. Under the four cultivators' guidance, some landed to the right, others to the left.</p><p>Huan Shen continued walking, unable to see anyone ahead or behind.  He didn't know how many remained; a profound loneliness washed over him, the underwater temptation growing stronger.</p><p>The illusion couldn't affect his mind, but the strong wind rapidly depleted his spiritual energy.</p><p>He displayed superb acting, his expression shifting between contortion and confusion, as if struggling against the bridge. His spiritual energy fluctuated with his expressions.</p><p>"It's almost time…"</p><p>Huan Shen sensed his spiritual energy nearing depletion.  A look of intense panic flashed across his face. Unable to maintain his spiritual energy, he fell from the Cloud Bridge.</p>
