<h1>First Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty-Seventh Chapter: Ten Thousand Cultivators Arrive to Offer Congratulations</h1><p>"Tomorrow, the Azure Sheep Temple's Founding Ceremony will surely attract ten thousand cultivators to offer congratulations."</p><p>Mu Yifeng took out a Mustard Seed Pouch, "Your brother ordered people to pack all the Immortal Peaches, Spiritual Fruits, and Jade Nectar from Shao Hua Mountain and bring them over; you should be able to use them. Other congratulatory gifts will be given tomorrow, Junior Brother, don't dislike them."</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu is truly delivering charcoal in the snow!"</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it without ceremony, "In the future, if you encounter any difficulties, just look for me. When you reach the Golden Core peak, you must come to Azure Sheep Temple; there's a big surprise for you!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng was also qualified to experience the Mind Light Futon.</p><p>This was the greatest reward Qin Sang could give to Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Mu Yifeng revealed a look of anticipation, then remembered another matter, and said, "There's also someone who wants to meet Junior Brother, the Palace Master of the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace—Huang Shengzi. Shao Hua Mountain is overwhelmed, and the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace also wants to find a new backer. If Junior Brother Qin isn't interested, just send him away."</p><p>Gong Liangyu had died inexplicably in the Blood Lake.</p><p>The Palace Master's whereabouts were unknown, and the Soul Lamp left in the sect had been extinguished.</p><p>What shocked the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace even more was that the most important Nascent Soul Puppet had also disappeared with Gong Liangyu.</p><p>Those in the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace who knew the truth kept silent about this matter. After the panic, they hastily elected a new Palace Master, Huang Shengzi, to stabilize the situation.</p><p>"Junior Huang Shengzi pays respects to Senior Qin."</p><p>Huang Shengzi entered the main hall and bowed in salute.</p><p>On the outside, he appeared to be a calm and steady middle-aged man. He was very familiar with Mu Yifeng and secretly used his eyes to inquire about Qin Sang's attitude.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Huang, there's no need to be so polite."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was gentle.</p><p>Huang Shengzi felt slightly relieved. Having received a reminder from Mu Yifeng, he didn't dare to hesitate and took out a jade slip from his bosom, respectfully saying, "These are the several secret realms controlled by my Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace, which are rich in spirit medicines and immortal fruits…"</p><p>Before he could finish speaking.</p><p>The jade slip was summoned into Qin Sang's hand, and he casually flipped through it, seemingly not very interested.</p><p>Huang Shengzi observed his expression, secretly anxious. Just as he was about to say something more, he suddenly heard Qin Sang say, "I have long heard of the Four Great Secret Talismans of the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace; they are extremely profound."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Huang Shengzi secretly lamented, not expecting this person to have such a big appetite, actually setting his sights on the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace's true inheritance, the Four Great Secret Talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the jade slip in his hand, returned it to Huang Shengzi, and said with a profound meaning, "Qin has some interest in the Inner Landscape Essence Talisman; I wonder if Fellow Daoist Huang can offer some guidance?"</p><p>The Inner Landscape Essence Talisman protects the nascent soul, making experiencing the Mind Light Futon most stable.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally planned to find a time to go to the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace and exchange treasures for the method of refining the Inner Landscape Essence Talisman. The Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace had lost its Nascent Soul Puppet and would probably not dare to refuse.</p><p>Since the other party had taken the initiative to come to his door, Qin Sang would not be polite.</p><p>Huang Shengzi was stunned.</p><p>Of the Four Great Secret Talismans, the Nascent Soul Puppet was already lost.</p><p>The Heavenly Dipper Blade Talisman and the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman were one for combat and one for escape.</p><p>Relatively speaking, the difficulty of cultivating the Inner Landscape Essence Talisman was the greatest, and its use was the narrowest, especially after the Nascent Soul Puppet disappeared, it lost its greatest use.</p><p>After weighing the pros and cons, Huang Shengzi solemnly said, "Guidance is too much to ask; if Senior Qin is interested, this junior will definitely impart everything I know!"</p><p>……</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>Yuan Mirage Gate , now the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>The mountain gate was wide open!</p><p>Welcoming guests!</p><p>The news of Qin Sang establishing a sect had spread throughout the entire Northern Chen Domain, and there were even rumors that the Azure Sheep Temple would accept disciples on the day of the celebration, which was widely circulated among rogue cultivators.</p><p>Even rogue cultivators from the Northern Chen Great Desert had traveled thousands of miles to attend the ceremony.</p><p>As the east began to brighten, there were already many figures outside the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>Among the surrounding mountains, birds, beasts, fish, and insects were awakened from their sleep, saw streaks of shocking rainbow-like escape lights in the sky, and, sensed the terrifying aura emanating from these people, they fell into panic.</p><p>Azure Sheep Temple's Welcoming Guest Peak.</p><p>Led by Li Yufu, many disciples all looked delighted and energetic.</p><p>After preparing for many years, they had finally waited for the day of establishing the sect.</p><p>In particular, their temple master was Qin Sang, one of the elders of the Northern Chen Alliance and one of the top experts in the Northern Chen Domain, which made all the disciples feel honored.</p><p>The celebration had not yet begun, and those famous sects had not yet arrived.</p><p>But looking at the situation, some people began to worry whether the sect would be able to accommodate so many attending cultivators.</p><p>Over the decades, the Azure Sheep Temple had taken in many new disciples. Except for Shangguan Lifeng, who was accompanying Qin Sang, everyone was at Welcoming Guest Peak, awaiting arrangements.</p><p>The Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea's many demons were also there.</p><p>Tan Yi'en had been a steward for many years and was extremely good at handling such matters, busy but not chaotic, everything was in order.</p><p>Li Yufeng and others also obeyed Tan Yi'en's instructions.</p><p>"Master Ancestor, can you see this?"</p><p>Li Yufu raised his head and looked towards the forbidden area.</p><p>Qin Sang had moved the entire Azure Sheep Temple here and had also invited the spirit tablets of Yun Youzi, Jixin Daoist, and Mingyue over to be enshrined here.</p><p>In addition, the Azure Sheep Temple's inheritance in the mortal world had never been cut off.</p><p>When Jing Tian ascended, his lifespan was eighty-two, and he had dozens of disciples.</p><p>These disciples widely spread the Dao in the countries controlled by the Azure Sheep Temple. The Azure Sheep Temple now had thousands of Daoist temples in the mortal world, countless believers, and thriving incense offerings.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Chi Lei, Senior Brother Li, Senior Sister Mei, you are here to welcome guests. The famous sects of the Northern Chen Alliance will definitely send people, as well as Nascent Soul Ancestors and Demon Kings who have good relations with Martial Uncle; do not neglect the etiquette."</p><p>Tan Yi'en's words pulled his thoughts back.</p><p>Li Yufu nodded and saw Elder Xun of the Yuan Mirage Gate  next to him, saying, "Elder Xun should also be with us."</p><p>Although the Yuan Mirage Gate  had not merged into the Azure Sheep Temple, it still followed Qin Sang's lead and had close ties with the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>Within the Azure Sheep Temple, there were some disciples who came from the Yuan Mirage Gate .</p><p>These people were later brought in by Qing Jun  and had no affection for the Leng family, father and son, being equivalent to Qing Jun's 's successors. Under Qing Jun's 's instructions, Qin Sang had incorporated them into the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>Right now.</p><p>Within the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>Led by Li Yufu, as Yun Youzi's successor, was the orthodox line of the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>Led by Mei Gu, was the Demonic Flame Gate lineage, renamed Demonic Flame Peak.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng brought back several disciples from outside, propping up the framework of the Sword Cultivation lineage.</p><p>Qing Jun  was the daughter of Qing Zhu , but her Puppet Dao had no successors and had no connection with Qing Zhu . Led by a Golden Core stage female disciple named Zhao Ying, most of them cultivated the Yuan Mirage Gate's  Formation Dao, which could also be considered a lineage.</p><p>In addition, the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea would also leave some demon beasts in the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang also had miscellaneous techniques such as the *All Heaven Demon Sound*, which were all placed in the sect for disciples to choose and cultivate.</p><p>Although several lineages were separated, Qin Sang did not want to increase internal rifts within the Azure Sheep Temple. Therefore, the lineages would not be clearly divided. As long as they were not worried about affecting their own Dao path, they could change to cultivate other techniques.</p><p>As for the internal structure of the Azure Sheep Temple, there would also be a distinction between inner and outer sects. Bai Hanqiu was responsible for outer sect affairs. Outer sect disciples could enter the inner sect after Foundation Establishment, and seniority would not be determined by cultivation level, but by the time of entering the inner sect.</p><p>For example, Li Yufu, Mei Gu, and Tan Yi'en were all second-generation disciples of the Azure Sheep Temple!</p><p>Tan Yi'en spoke quickly, and teams of disciples flew out of Welcoming Guest Peak, receiving guests in an orderly manner.</p><p>Before long.</p><p>The morning sun rose.</p><p>Purple Qi came from the east.</p><p>Suddenly, a bell sound came from the forbidden area.</p><p>The sound reverberated throughout the universe!</p>
