<h1>Chapter 610:  The Silver Needle Seal and the Stone Bridge Zen</h1><p>Chen Yan's eyes flashed, revealing a terrifying killing intent.  Dongyang Bo remained unfazed, speaking coldly.</p><p>"Cultivating the *Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing* leads to the birth of a heart demon after use, due to the nature of the practice. The more people are used, the stronger the heart demon becomes.  It takes deep root and is almost impossible to eradicate.</p><p>"Many have searched for secret methods to remove the heart demon, only to find them futile. The heart demon can reemerge at any time.</p><p>"The vast majority who cultivate this technique fail. Before they even sense a breakthrough, they are overwhelmed by the ever-growing heart demon and perish from its backlash.</p><p>"Even those who find a glimmer of a chance to form a Nascent Soul often fail to overcome the tribulation of the heart demon, falling during the Nascent Soul Tribulation.</p><p>"Only a handful succeed, mostly those with exceptional talent—some even comparable to yourself, Miss Chen Yan—who, using this forbidden technique only once, managed to form a Nascent Soul.</p><p>"With their talent, even without this method, their chances of forming a Nascent Soul would be very high, ensuring a bright future. Using this method only plants a hidden danger, making their Dao heart unstable and tormented by the heart demon.</p><p>"Therefore, those with poor talent cannot use it, while those with high talent are unwilling and dare not use it, hence its status as a forbidden technique.</p><p>"However, this is not the most terrifying danger of the *Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing*!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo paused, glancing at Qin Sang.</p><p>"The process of the forbidden technique's 'cultivation' is essentially a contest of willpower and Dao heart between the two participants. This process leads to three outcomes.</p><p>"If the cultivator succeeds, then there is no need to say more.</p><p>"If the cultivator fails and is countered, their Dao heart may be shattered, turning them into the 'cultivated' party's demonic slave.  There's even a rather poetic name for the female counterpart of this, the Xuan Nu.</p><p>"This mostly happens to cultivators who have used the forbidden technique many times. Their heart demons are strong, their Dao hearts unstable, so being controlled is only natural.</p><p>"The third outcome is your situation. The 'cultivated' party perseveres until the end, without the cultivator experiencing any backlash, it's a stalemate.  While not as disastrous as becoming a demonic slave, the 'cultivated' party will become an indelible mark on the cultivator's heart!"</p><p>"Such is the unpredictability of life!"</p><p>A strange smile played on Dongyang Bo's lips.</p><p>"Miss Chen Yan, you strongly refused my Foundation Establishment disciple becoming your 'vessel' years ago. You must have sensed something then, right?</p><p>"While Dao heart isn't entirely determined by cultivation level, those with high cultivation, through repeated enlightenment, usually possess a stronger Dao heart and willpower.</p><p>"Yet, who would have thought a disciple with incredibly poor talent, possessing five elemental spiritual roots and only able to reach Foundation Establishment with Danlong ginseng, would have such a firm Dao heart that even someone on the verge of forming a Nascent Soul couldn't break it?</p><p>"I myself doubted this, so I tested you several times, but you never revealed any flaws.  It was only during your tribulation that I discovered you'd used the silver needle sealing technique, confirming my suspicions!"</p><p>Qin Sang listened to Dongyang Bo's long explanation, utterly confused.</p><p>Remembering the 'cultivation' process, he'd been so focused on protecting his own foundation, terrified of being drained, that he hadn't even felt any so-called 'contest of Dao hearts'.</p><p>Did Dongyang Bo conceal crucial aspects of the *Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing* from Chen Yan, leading her to unknowingly show mercy?</p><p>Or was it the Jade Buddha's protection that saved him?</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at Chen Yan.</p><p>What exactly was this 'mark' that forced Chen Yan to use the silver needle sealing technique on herself?</p><p>Chen Yan seemed to be confirmed in her secret.</p><p>Her face was deathly pale, her teeth biting her lip, drawing blood.</p><p>Undeterred, Dongyang Bo continued, ignoring Chen Yan's reaction, "You tried to use the silver needle sealing technique to block the impact of the mark, thinking that once Qin Sang died, the problem would naturally resolve itself. How naive! If this forbidden technique's dangers could be solved by a simple silver needle sealing technique, would it still be called forbidden?"</p><p>Dongyang Bo pointed at Qin Sang, "Believe me, if I kill him right now in front of you, your Dao heart will immediately shatter, and your cultivation will plummet from Nascent Soul to Golden Core! Trying to save your master is a fool's dream!"</p><p>At these words, Qin Sang and Chen Yan both turned pale.</p><p>Qin Sang never imagined his fate would be inexplicably bound to the woman who 'cultivated' him.</p><p>One act of selling himself, leaving a legacy of trouble to this day.</p><p>Thinking it over, if I truly become an indelible mark on Chen Yan's heart, she would do everything to protect her life to avoid a decline in her cultivation.  That might actually be a good thing for me.</p><p>Just then, Chen Yan coldly said, "If that's the case, why didn't you kill him immediately?  My cultivation has fallen to the Golden Core stage, you could easily take the Blood Bead, wouldn't you get what you want?"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang also considered this, surprised by Chen Yan's composure. She wasn't intimidated by Dongyang Bo and immediately identified the key point.</p><p>Given Dongyang Bo's deep-laid schemes and ruthless methods, since he's already broken with us, he certainly wouldn't hold back.  There must be something untrue in his words.</p><p>My influence on Chen Yan is real, that much is true. But whether my death would truly cause her to have a Dao heart collapse, resulting in a fall back to the Golden Core stage, is questionable. Dongyang Bo's actions show he doesn't have absolute certainty either; he's afraid of unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>A flicker of anger crossed Dongyang Bo's eyes, but his voice remained calm. "Miss Chen Yan, you can gamble on it. I, at most, lose a chance to find the treasure. But what price will you pay? Not only will you fail to rescue your master this time, but your cultivation will plummet to the Golden Core stage. Returning to the Nascent Soul stage will be harder than ascending to heaven, and you might never have another chance to save anyone! Even if your master has incredible cultivation, trapped in the Demon Cave, how long can he possibly survive?"</p><p>Seeing Chen Yan remain silent, Dongyang Bo looked up at the dome of the bronze hall.</p><p>"Miss Chen Yan, I'll be frank. The true treasure in this tower isn't in the Demon Cave, but above! That object is also the key to sealing the Demon Cave.  Once obtained, the seal can easily be broken.</p><p>"I don't want to create an irreconcilable feud with you and your master unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"The hidden danger of the *Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing* isn't without a solution.</p><p>"I have a Buddhist cultivation technique here, the *Shiqiao Chan*, a rare and exceptional method of the Path of No Love.</p><p>"I've already sealed Qin Sang's cultivation with a forbidden talisman.</p><p>"Once I hand him over to you, you just need to keep him in your cave abode. At the opportune moment, switch to cultivating the *Shiqiao Chan*, follow the imprint, treat it as your true heart, and wholeheartedly consider him your most intimate lover, spending day and night together.</p><p>"When your love becomes profoundly deep, inseparable and inextricably entwined, then cultivate the Path of No Love, and kill your husband to achieve enlightenment.</p><p>"Not only will it solve the hidden danger, but it might even lead to unforeseen blessings, pushing your cultivation even further!"</p>
