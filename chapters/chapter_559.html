<h1>Chapter 552: Unexpected Event</h1><p>After they brought out their most relied-upon magical artifacts,</p><p>for a moment, the courtyard was filled with a dazzling array of colors, a beautiful sight.</p><p>Beyond the common artifacts like swords, mirrors, towers, banners, and flags, there were many that even Qin Sang didn't recognize.  Their functions must have been quite unique.  Those qualified to enter the courtyard were certainly no ordinary individuals.</p><p>Mu Yifeng still wielded his Nine Fire Divine Blade. This artifact had been painstakingly refined over many years, an unknown amount of effort poured into it.  Now, the flames of the nine fire dragons faintly glowed purple, surpassing the simple classification of a top-grade artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that Mu Yifeng's single-minded devotion was likely in preparation for further enhancing the Nine Fire Divine Blade after he formed his Golden Core, intending to make it his life-bound treasure.</p><p>The artifact Zhan Yi used was a fist-sized brass bell, unseen before.</p><p>Soon, everyone was ready.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Chen Yan lightly waved her hand, spiritual energy gathering at her fingertips into a paper crane. The paper crane let out a clear chirp, spread its wings, and flew into the courtyard.</p><p>The paper crane hovered above everyone, then suddenly flapped its wings rapidly, a series of gentle winds descending from the sky.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>A violent wind suddenly raged in the courtyard, yet it was precisely controlled to encompass only those present. This level of precise control alone was beyond compare.</p><p>Qin Sang silently observed the courtyard, attempting to glimpse Chen Yan's cultivation level through the paper crane and spiritual wind, but found nothing.</p><p>The spiritual wind grew denser, solidifying.</p><p>Like a dark cloud overhead, it slowly pressed down!</p><p>A curtain of spiritual wind formed around each person, incredibly dense and imposing.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and the others immediately activated their artifacts, resisting the pressure of the spiritual wind with all their might.</p><p>As the curtains of spiritual wind thickened, the figures within became almost invisible.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Finally, someone couldn't hold on and fell.  Just before hitting the ground, the pressure on them suddenly vanished, maintaining their composure.</p><p>This person bowed apologetically and quietly retreated to the side.</p><p>The pressure on the others continued to increase.</p><p>Seeing that she couldn't probe Chen Yan's cultivation through the paper crane, Qin Sang stopped trying and focused on Mu Yifeng and Zhan Yi, the two she knew.</p><p>Where Mu Yifeng stood, only the shadows of the nine fire dragons were visible, forming a ring to support the spiritual wind curtain.</p><p>Zhan Yi's brass bell also hovered above his head, emitting a rich yellow light like a lamp. The increasingly rapid shaking of the bell could be heard.</p><p>'Bang bang bang...'</p><p>One by one fell, including several False Core Realm experts.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. It seemed this test wasn't simply about cultivation. The specifics of what was happening within the spiritual wind curtain remained unknown.</p><p>As time passed, fewer and fewer remained.</p><p>Suddenly, Zhan Yi roared, the bell's ringing becoming frantic. The yellow light above his head intensified, but to no avail; his figure swayed violently.</p><p>After the curtain dissipated, Zhan Yi regained his balance.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the unconcealed disappointment on his face.  Her mind stirred, she discreetly observed Che Yu Tao, seeing him shake his head slightly, a trace of disappointment flashing across his face.  This gave her something to think about.</p><p>Finally, only three people remained, including Mu Yifeng.</p><p>These three were clearly at their limits. Mu Yifeng's nine fire dragons had become extremely thin, like flickering candles in the wind, about to extinguish.</p><p>A barely audible sigh came from under his cloak.</p><p>Che Yu Tao spoke somewhat awkwardly.</p><p>“Our disciples are not up to par, making a spectacle for Miss Chen Yan!”</p><p>“The sect leader and the lady's orders came too suddenly.  Other disciples are either away on training or in closed-door cultivation striving for the Golden Core.  Getting them here now would leave insufficient time for refinement, making it impossible to suppress the ferocious spirits within the Beast Mark.</p><p>“And we can’t trust disciples from other sects.</p><p>“But with the Five Elements Beast Mark open, the five are one. With Mu Bai and the others, the two slightly weaker ones shouldn't greatly affect the overall situation.”</p><p>Chen Yan hummed.  “It must be so.”</p><p>Before she finished speaking, a dragon's roar echoed from the courtyard.  The nine fire dragons around Mu Yifeng suddenly dispersed simultaneously, then a point of red light emerged from beneath the curtain, like a sharp cone piercing it.</p><p>With a loud boom, Mu Yifeng burst forth, wielding the Nine Fire Divine Blade!</p><p>Mu Yifeng staggered slightly, but finally stood firm.</p><p>A reversal of fortune.</p><p>Che Yu Tao's eyes lit up. He praised, “Excellent! Come over here as well.”</p><p>“Thank you, Master Che!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng bowed, storing the Nine Fire Divine Blade within his body to cultivate it.  He then strode to Qin Sang’s side, raising an eyebrow triumphantly.</p><p>The other two weren't so lucky.  Despite numerous attempts, they couldn't break through the barrier. Finally, one collapsed from exhaustion, and the pressure on both of them vanished.</p><p>“You may all leave.”</p><p>Che Yutao summoned the remaining person forward, dismissing the others with a wave of his hand. Then, he turned to Chen Yan and said, “The candidates have been selected. I’ll report to the Master.”</p><p>Chen Yan nodded, then suddenly stood up, her figure flashing before disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Throughout, she hadn't seemed to glance at Qin Sang once.</p><p>Qin Sang and the four others stood side-by-side, immensely curious.</p><p>Only then, from Che Yutao, did they learn that their Grandmaster had arrived at Xuanlu Pass, and that this trial had been initiated by the Ancestor.</p><p>For some reason, Qin Sang felt a sudden sense of foreboding.</p><p>Che Yutao flicked out a beam of green light.  Moments later, a strange tightness gripped everyone's hearts, and a gentle voice echoed in their ears:  “Is it them?”</p><p>It was Lord Dongyang!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind flashed with recognition.</p><p>Che Yutao bowed to the void, respectfully saying, "Reporting to Master, these five disciples are currently the strongest within the Pass."</p><p>With a word of affirmation, a five-colored rainbow shot into the hall.  Upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be the light emanating from five seals.</p><p>These five seals were uniform in size and shape, differing only in their carvings.  Each seal featured a mythical beast: the legendary Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, White Tiger, and a creature resembling a Qilin, but known as Gouchen.</p><p>“Let them carefully understand the mysteries of the seals and assist me!”</p><p>“Yes, Master!”</p><p>Che Yutao received the seals, turned to Qin Sang and the others, and with a gentle flick of his wrist, the five seals flew towards them.</p><p>The seal before Qin Sang was the one adorned with the Black Tortoise.</p><p>The Black Tortoise on the seal was lifelike—its limbs thick, its head held high as if roaring at the heavens, exuding a fierce, untamed spirit.</p><p>Che Yutao said calmly, “From now on, each of you will wield one of these seals and diligently refine it.  Within half a year, you must subdue the ferocious spirit within. Then, you will accompany the Grandmaster and Miss Chen Yan to the Purple Micro Palace.”</p><p>What!</p><p>Qin Sang was thunderstruck.</p><p>—</p><p>Finally here!  Below are two group chat links.
