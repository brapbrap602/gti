<h1></h1><p>The two pursued for a while, watching helplessly as the azure light grew more and more distant, leaving them behind.</p><p>"Enough! There's no need to chase. Lest it cause misunderstandings."</p><p>The azure-robed old man suppressed his escape light, calling out to his companion to stop.</p><p>Continuing the chase, the other party might suspect they harbored malicious intent, which would be undesirable.</p><p>…</p><p>Bi Fang fled.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators halted.</p><p>Qin Sang saw everything, but remained vigilant, maintaining his escape art.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly used its divine power, keeping watch for a long time. Confirming that there were no pursuers behind him, Qin Sang finally breathed a sigh of relief, retracted his escape light, and descended to the sea surface.</p><p>This pursuit and escape had depleted his already scarce true essence, leaving him with very little.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly in his heart, glancing back.</p><p>With so many demon kings and Nascent Soul cultivators gathered here, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel uneasy, worried that he had unintentionally stumbled into a vortex of turmoil.</p><p>In his current state, any disturbance could lead to his demise.</p><p>A newcomer.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to be embroiled in conflict for no reason.</p><p>He needed to at least understand the identities and origins of both sides, as well as the cause of the disturbance, before making a judgment.</p><p>"I should leave this place as soon as possible, the farther the better…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, taking out a sea chart.</p><p>He estimated his current location.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that there were some scattered islands between him and Crescent Moon Island. According to the markings on the sea chart, these islands were controlled by humans, even human cultivators.</p><p>There were many human sects.</p><p>However, whether it was safe there at this moment was unknown.</p><p>After a brief period of adjustment, Qin Sang selected a more remote island, planning to go and see the situation first.</p><p>This island was named Immortal Verdant Island. There were cultivators on the island, and the sea chart showed that the strongest island master was only in the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Qin Sang restrained his aura, flying low almost touching the sea surface, slowing down, maintaining a low profile, and ordered the Skyeye Butterfly to be constantly vigilant.</p><p>Fortunately, he didn't encounter any other cultivators or demons along the way.</p><p>By the time he arrived at Immortal Verdant Island, it was already midnight.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the silent Immortal Verdant Island from afar, approaching cautiously.</p><p>There was a mortal city on the island, with thriving popularity, truly a small island nation.</p><p>Without needing to ask the mortals, Qin Sang could see that in the very center of Immortal Verdant Island, there was a mountain range surrounded by immortal clouds, an anomaly formed by a spirit array.</p><p>That must be the cultivators' cave dwelling.</p><p>Secretly entering one of the mortal cities, Qin Sang sensed the aura of cultivators in the city lord's mansion, but only in the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>City Lord's Mansion.</p><p>Several cultivators were gathered in the main hall, speaking in low voices. Some had excited expressions, while others looked blank and hesitant. What they had in common was that everyone had hidden worries in their eyes.</p><p>These cultivators were all dressed in luxurious clothes, exuding nobility, more like pampered and wealthy gentlemen.</p><p>"Has anyone seen the island master recently?"</p><p>A middle-aged man wearing a dragon robe, with a wide and fat frame, had been made impatient by the others' words and waved his hand sharply, questioning in a low voice.</p><p>The crowd paused, looking at each other.</p><p>"The island master summoned us two months ago…"</p><p>The dragon-robed man interrupted coldly, "Don't speak nonsense! Of course, I know that the island master summoned us two months ago. I'm asking if anyone has seen the island master in the past two months, and what about the Wang siblings?"</p><p>"Shhh! Prince Long, keep your voice down!"</p><p>The others' expressions changed slightly, instinctively glancing in the direction of the immortal mountain.</p><p>The dragon-robed man didn't dare to act recklessly either, calming his agitation, he whispered, "In recent months, this prince has made several excuses to visit the immortal mountain, but each time I was blocked by that old thing guarding the gate. The Wang siblings are young and immature, and they would come down the mountain every month or so, lingering, but now they've been in seclusion for so long. Combining this with the rumors coming from outside the island recently, how can we not overthink it!"</p><p>"You mean…"</p><p>A younger prince beside him asked anxiously, "The island master received word in advance and has already left Immortal Verdant Island? Why didn't he tell us?"</p><p>The dragon-robed man sneered, "What are you and I? We're just tools used by the island master to control the mortals, given some small favors. Even the Qi Refining stage cultivation techniques are incomplete. Only the Wang siblings are the island master's direct disciples!"</p><p>Another old prince had remained silent, twisting wooden beads in his hand, he said in a deep voice, "It is said that the island master has a great background. There was once a Golden Core Senior who came to visit, and was very polite…"</p><p>Saying this, the old prince sighed, "It seems, the times are about to change!"</p><p>The dragon-robed man clenched his fist tightly, "If it's infighting within the cultivation world, they might not notice us. In the future, we can just change masters. I heard that demons are frequently appearing outside the island. I'm afraid that the demon race is invading. If that happens…"</p><p>The crowd shuddered.</p><p>Demons were brutal. They would rather die at the hands of cultivators.</p><p>At that time, the entire Immortal Verdant Island would be ravaged, and blood would flow like rivers.</p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p>The crowd fell into panic.</p><p>What if they guessed wrong? Without the island master's orders, leaving the island without permission would also lead to a miserable end.</p><p>Just then, everyone suddenly froze, the sound of their voices came to an abrupt halt. Some people even had their mouths open, as if time had been frozen.</p><p>The night-luminescent pearl used for lighting dimmed, and a figure walked out. It was Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the crowd who were imprisoned, and extended a finger, pointing at the space between the eyebrows of one of them.</p><p>After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Qin Sang walked out of the city lord's mansion.</p><p>Not clear on the identities of the two Nascent Souls he met earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to reveal his tracks, so he preferred to go through the trouble of asking them one by one first, then erasing everyone's memories.</p><p>In the room, the imprisonment on the crowd was released, and they continued their fierce discussion, completely unaware that a small segment of time had been lost from their lives.</p><p>Qin Sang then entered the immortal mountain.</p><p>The defensive spirit array was quite powerful, but in the eyes of the Skyeye Butterfly, it was full of loopholes. Qin Sang easily sneaked into the mountain.</p><p>The immortal mountain was deserted, with only a so-called 'gatekeeper'. This person was already old, and the island master had once shown him kindness, ordering him to guard the cave dwelling.</p><p>"The island master left two months ago, and recently more than one dragon boat has been attacked. Demons have been appearing frequently…"</p><p>Qin Sang asked for a lot of information, realizing that there was indeed something strange going on.</p><p>This place was also not safe.</p><p>"I must also leave this place of turmoil as soon as possible. Only by entering Crescent Moon Island can I safely recover."</p><p>Qin Sang occupied the island master's cave dwelling.</p><p>The spirit vein here was not satisfactory. Qin Sang didn't dare to stay long. After recovering thirty percent of his true essence, he hurriedly left.</p><p>Until Qin Sang left,</p><p>No one on Immortal Verdant Island knew that it had once been visited by a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Open sea area.</p><p>A beam of light came speeding, hovering slightly in the air.</p><p>Ripples rippled on the sea surface, then the void twisted and a phantom image of a small island emerged from the distortion, the light flashed, entering the island and disappearing without trace.</p><p>The island area was tightly compact.</p><p>There was a palace on the island, almost occupying most of the space.</p><p>The palace was golden and glorious. The azure-robed old man who startled Bi Fang sat on the main hall, the white-clothed scholar was not here, but there were two other Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>These two were willing to sit below, patiently listening to what the azure-robed old man was saying.</p><p>They had already noticed the moment the escape light broke in.</p><p>The azure-robed old man stopped talking, looked up at the outside of the palace.</p>
