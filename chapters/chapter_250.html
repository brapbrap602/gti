<h1>Chapter 243 The Ancient Well and the Creeping Vines</h1><p>The yard was a wasteland with collapsed gazebos, and half of the houses were no longer visible.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his joy and cautiously glanced around. He concealed his aura, traveled stealthily, and followed the Fire Jade Centipede into the courtyard.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang entered a wilderness courtyard and stood before the moon door, scrutinizing the courtyard.</p><p>Even in ruins, the extravagance was beyond imagination. The courtyard was paved with a foot of precious stone, which in the mundane world, could be a heirloom treasure.</p><p>Some of the jade stones were broken or incomplete, and in the cracks between the jades, clumps of grass had grown. Together with the broken walls of the remaining houses in the back, the entire courtyard looked desolate.</p><p>The courtyard was not large and could be seen in one glance.</p><p>Nothing peculiar could be seen in the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang used his divine sense to scan the courtyard a dozen times, not missing a single corner. He found no spiritual objects nor discovered any hidden restrictions.</p><p>Strangely, the Fire Jade Centipede's target was clear—this small courtyard.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede struggled violently in Qin Sang's palm, anxiously gnawing at the spiritual energy that bound it. Its perception was certainly not false, there must be a trick in the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, lifted his foot, and cautiously stepped inside. He walked along the corner of the wall, then walked through every inch of the courtyard. Everything was normal. He even tried to destroy a piece of jade, but there was no attack.</p><p>This was not surprising. If the spiritual object was so easy to find, it would have been taken away long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the moon door, looked down at the Fire Jade Centipede, then released it.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's slender body immediately contracted and ejected like a fire wire. It landed on the edge of the white jade, and then something surprising happened.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede followed a strange route, crawling swiftly on the ground. Its body sometimes bent and sometimes swung back and forth. The crawling route was not a straight line, it was exceptionally complicated and mysterious.</p><p>As the Fire Jade Centipede crawled faster and faster, Qin Sang suddenly felt a subtle wave in the courtyard.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang had not noticed any abnormalities!</p><p>Was this some kind of illusion formation?</p><p>As time went on, Qin Sang could even see ripples appearing in the void with his naked eye. Fortunately, the waves were not obvious, otherwise, it was possible to attract others.</p><p>Even at this moment, Qin Sang still could not perceive what formation was arranged in the courtyard, let alone break the formation.</p><p>While Qin Sang was secretly wondering, the front half of the Fire Jade Centipede suddenly disappeared into thin air. Qin Sang's eyes suddenly condensed, and he hurriedly urged the restriction he had placed on the Fire Jade Centipede, fixing it in place.</p><p>Half of the Fire Jade Centipede's body entered an unknown space, and the other half remained outside, as if the void had cut its body, it was very strange.</p><p>Qin Sang掠 to the Fire Jade Centipede, but found that no matter how he moved, he could not enter that space, and could not help but be secretly surprised.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Qin Sang ordered the Fire Jade Centipede to return to the moon door, then attached his divine sense to the Fire Jade Centipede, and followed into the courtyard step by step.</p><p>At first, there was no abnormality, but after a while, Qin Sang suddenly noticed a thin mist around him. Then the mist became thicker and thicker, and the surrounding scenery became dreamlike, not so clear, as if in a fairyland.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's heart moved, and he stopped. A strange mirror appeared in front of him, the mirror surface was slightly rippling, as if it was made of flowing water.</p><p>This was the core of the formation. Qin Sang realized that the Fire Jade Centipede must have entered the water mirror, so half of its body disappeared.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was still intact, indicating that there should be no danger inside, but it was better to be cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the ebony sword to protect his body and stepped into the water mirror.</p><p>In an instant, the clouds cleared and the fog dispersed.</p><p>The courtyard was still the courtyard.</p><p>The distant mountains were still the distant mountains.</p><p>The runes in the sky were crimson, as if a sea of fire was covering the sky.</p><p>Everything before seemed to be a dream.</p><p>Apart from this, the only change was that a well appeared in the center of the courtyard. Qin Sang was standing at the edge of the well, leaning slightly, and looking down.</p><p>The ancient well was deep, and the divine sense swept the bottom of the well, everything was normal, it was completely an ordinary well. The naked eye could barely see the bottom of the well, the water inside had long since dried up, and the bottom of the well was a deep black, There is a stone step that can only be passed by one person, extending all the way to the ground.</p><p>The master of the garden set up this powerful and secretive magic circle to hide this well!</p><p>Qin Sang was so excited to the extreme, and he touched the puppet bag, and saw a zombie jump into the well. Going down along the stone steps, he finally disappeared from his sight.</p><p>Until it was about to get rid of Qin Sang’s perception, the zombie still hadn’t suffered an attack.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly jumped into the well, following the zombie far away.</p><p>The stone steps were long, pointing to the depth of the earth. As Qin Sang walked deeper and deeper, the surrounding air became hotter and hotter. He guessed secretly in his heart, the stone steps wouldn’t connect to the magma river directly?</p><p>Just at this moment, Qin Sang felt that the zombie had walked to the end of the stone steps, so he hurriedly asked the zombie to come back, and then quietly rushed down.</p><p>……</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the last level of the stone steps, not even daring to breathe, the expectation and joy on his face disappeared completely, and was replaced by an extremely solemn expression.</p><p>He guessed correctly. This stone step really connects to the magma river, but it does not directly connect with the magma river, but enters a huge cave.</p><p>The cave is nearly ten Zhang high, very wide and boundless.</p><p>Under the cave, it seems that it cannot be called a river, it is more appropriate to say it is a magma lake.</p><p>Just like the place of trial, there is also an identical round restriction on the magma Lake.</p><p>However, there is no fog in the cave to cover the sight. The naked eye can clearly see countless flame flying monkeys playing and frolicking above the magma Lake.</p><p>The most notable thing is that in the heart of the magma Lake, also in the middle surrounded by the monkey group, there are some huge fiery red vines growing out of the magma Lake.</p><p>These vines are entangled together, so thick that they can be hugged by several people, like an ancient tree, with sparse branches and leaves, reaching up to the top of the cave, taking root, holding tightly to the stone wall, and hanging down again.</p><p>On the tip of the thickest vine, hung a fist-sized round fruit.</p><p>This fruit is golden in color, which looks really abrupt.</p><p>The flying monkeys seemed to know the preciousness of the fruit. They would also avoid it even while playing. Perhaps, they were more like the guardian beasts of the vine and fruit.</p><p>There were not as many flying monkeys here as in the trial site, but Qin Sang stood still and dared not rush in to pick the fruits.</p><p>Because the color of the flame on the flying monkeys is not crimson, but dark red!</p><p>Even while playing, every time they make a move, they have a power that shocks Qin Sang.</p>
