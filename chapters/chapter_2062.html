<h1>Chapter 2053 Si You</h1><p>Qin Sang returned to the Turbulent Sea, and Su Nu obtained the bamboo token.  They immediately set off for the Haitang Academy.</p><p>The Turbulent Sea lived up to its name; the water here was noticeably murkier than elsewhere.  Upon seeing clear water, they knew they had left the Turbulent Sea behind.  Haitang Academy lay to the north, separated by a vast, unclaimed expanse of ocean.</p><p>Unclaimed meant lawless, the most chaotic and violent area in Lansha Prefecture, yet also a place where one could easily become rich overnight. Such places were common in Lansha.</p><p>The two traveled without rest.  Approaching Haitang Academy, the cultivation world noticeably calmed.  The occasional cultivator with a violent aura quickly subdued their fierce demeanor, becoming cautious and reserved, unlike their counterparts elsewhere.</p><p>Haitang Academy emphasized gentlemanly conduct, but to outsiders, they were far from benevolent. If anyone misbehaved nearby and was discovered by the Academy, even outside its territory, the Academy wouldn't hesitate to capture and, under the guise of "instruction," punish them.</p><p>It was said that once imprisoned in the Academy's jail, even the most vicious individuals would confess all their misdeeds.  Their punishment?  Life imprisonment, with no hope of release.</p><p>"That's Haitang Academy ahead."</p><p>Su Nu produced a nautical chart and said after examining it.</p><p>Qin Sang looked out, seeing boundless blue waves, not a single island, no cultivators, and no sign of a protective formation.</p><p>Haitang Academy governed a vast area.  To seal off the entire sea and prevent outside threats, a massive formation would be needed. The Academy might possess the capability, but they hadn't done so.</p><p>Theoretically, Qin Sang and Su Nu could conceal their auras and secretly enter.  However, the Academy undoubtedly had detection methods, and since they needed to search for the members of the Outsider race, they might stay for a long time; stealth would be impractical.</p><p>It was better to use the gentleman's token and openly move within the Academy.</p><p>On the empty sea, not a single figure was visible.  Qin Sang and Su Nu maintained their speed, proceeding calmly without hiding their auras.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's expression shifted; he stopped, gazing east.  Su Nu sensed it too; two cultivators were flying towards them, their purpose clear – they were after them.</p><p>"Haitang Academy does indeed have remote sensing capabilities," Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>Su Nu nodded slightly, pondering, "If we use concealment techniques, they shouldn't detect us.  However, the closer we get to the Academy's core, the stronger their detection methods will be. Brother Qin, obtaining a Lan token will make things much easier."</p><p>They waited briefly. Two streaks of light descended from the sky, revealing two scholarly men in long robes, one tall and one short.</p><p>The middle-aged man, a Nascent Soul cultivator, glanced at Su Nu, his heart filled with awe. He bowed, "Greetings, Master. I am Xie Yuan, the pavilion father of the Shexi Pavilion here."</p><p>They already knew that Haitang Academy divided its territory into pavilions, with a pavilion father heading each, assisted by numerous officials and soldiers.</p><p>Su Nu stepped forward, returned the courtesy, and said politely, "Greetings, Master Xie.  My companion and I have important business at your esteemed Academy. We ask for your assistance in passing through your domain."</p><p>Su Nu produced the bamboo token.</p><p>She and Qin Sang had agreed to use the bamboo token first, saving the Lan token for when absolutely necessary, as the bamboo token allowed for a few attendants.</p><p>Xie Yuan accepted the bamboo token with both hands, inspected it, left his aura imprint on it, and returned it.  "The token is authentic.  Please proceed as you wish, Master."</p><p>Those of low cultivation would be questioned, but someone as powerful as Su Nu, with an unpredictable temperament and formidable aura, wouldn't be detained. Others would handle matters further inside.</p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p>Su Nu bowed again, then, with Qin Sang quietly beside her, they soared into the sky.  Watching them go, Xie Yuan sent a message before returning to his pavilion.</p><p>The bamboo token proved effective.  They eventually settled temporarily at the Sanguan Pavilion, one of the furthest reaches accessible with the token.</p><p>They chose Fuyue Island as their base.</p><p>Haitang Academy's emphasis on gentlemanly conduct created a unique scene of cultivators and mortals coexisting. In roadside teahouses, one often saw cultivators and mortals debating face-to-face, with mortals sometimes winning arguments.  However, cultivators couldn't resort to force; they could only submit.</p><p>One day, Su Nu was away.  Qin Sang, enjoying tea at a teahouse, overheard an argument upstairs and joined the gathering. He found two Golden Core cultivators disputing over a spiritual herb.</p><p>They had discovered it together, but a conflict arose for unknown reasons.</p><p>Two men argued fiercely, their disagreement escalating.  To settle their dispute, they chose a most unusual method: a poetry contest!</p><p>Cultivators possess exceptional memories, so reciting poems is hardly a challenge.  However, this contest required impromptu verse-making, with the opponent dictating the form and theme.  The poem had to be of high quality, earning the approval of onlookers; failure resulted in a three-cup penalty.</p><p>The two men skillfully crafted verse after verse, eliciting enthusiastic applause from the teahouse patrons. Qin Sang exclaimed that he was witnessing something truly remarkable.</p><p>He surveyed the crowd; nearly everyone was captivated by the poetry contest, their passion bordering on fanaticism.  The magical herb they had previously been arguing over was completely forgotten.</p><p>"Brother Qin, why don't you join in?"</p><p>Su Nu, returning from outside, teased Qin Sang, who was engrossed in the contest.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, declining the invitation. "The world is full of wonders.  I wouldn't have believed this scene were I not seeing it with my own eyes."</p><p>The two men left the teahouse, unnoticed by the others who remained absorbed in the poetry competition.</p><p>Su Nu glanced back, saying, "They must be scholars from the Literary Ranking."</p><p>The Haitang Academy maintains separate literary and martial rankings. Those listed are all exceptional individuals eligible for training at the academy. The literary ranking focuses on Daoist philosophy and scriptures, with minimal emphasis on combat skills; they prefer intellectual sparring.  However, as long as the Haitang Academy stands, there's little need for them to engage in physical combat.</p><p>Outside the teahouse, Qin Sang whispered, "The Yi people are making a significant move?"</p><p>He and Su Nu had been separately investigating, uncovering several clues.</p><p>Su Nu nodded gravely.  "The situation is dire. They're moving faster than we anticipated. Or perhaps something has happened to the two Tianbu Yi people."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  "Are you certain the two Tianbu Yi are hiding in the Jiusi Pavilion?"</p><p>"Almost certainly!  The Yi people are using various methods; several experts infiltrated the Jiusi Pavilion long ago. Recently, they sent in a large reinforcement.  With so many, they can't remain hidden for long.  I expect they'll strike soon."</p><p>Su Nu's tone was serious.  They had assumed the Yi would act slowly, giving them ample time to prepare. Now, the situation had become urgent, demanding a rapid response.</p><p>"Jiusi Pavilion… I recall it requires a special pass to enter," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Su Nu sighed. "The Yi people have operated in Lansha Prefecture for many years.  Such methods are to be expected. We underestimated them."</p><p>"No time to lose. Let's go to Jiusi Pavilion!" Qin Sang, foregoing a return to his dwelling, headed straight for the city gates, coldly stating, "Even if we can't exploit any weaknesses, we can try to force their hand and stir things up!"</p><p>Leaving the city, the two immediately activated their flight talismans.</p><p>Su Nu whispered, "This is Haitang Academy's territory; the situation is unclear, so we shouldn't alarm them yet. I planted a secret agent within that Yi faction. It was meant to be activated when the time was right, but we must awaken it early."</p><p>They crossed the Sanguan Pavilion and reached the boundary of its jurisdiction, where Qin Sang used the pass to proceed. They encountered minor obstacles along the way, easily overcome, until they reached the vicinity of the Jiusi Pavilion.</p><p>To avoid alerting anyone, they refrained from using the pass and suppressed their auras, carefully sneaking in.  After traveling secretly for a while, seeing no obstacles, they relaxed and sped towards the location Su Nu had indicated.</p><p>They avoided the main islands and cities as much as possible, finally stopping at a secluded islet.</p><p>Su Nu concentrated for a moment, sat cross-legged, and said, "The pawn is nearby. Please protect me, Brother Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, waved his sleeve, and a thick sea mist enveloped the islet, concealing it.</p><p>Su Nu closed her eyes, manipulated hand seals, and performed a secret technique.  After a moment, she abruptly opened her eyes, her pupils deeply dark, seeming to draw in the minds of others.  Her gaze shifted slightly, focusing on a specific direction.</p><p>A subtle wave emanated from her eyes, strangely anomalous, quickly dissipating.</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>In a distant sea area…</p><p>Numerous islands densely populated with mortals and cultivators were scattered here.</p><p>Unaware of the impending danger, beneath the surface of this sea, a group of uninvited guests lurked, forming a silent encirclement.</p><p>They remained hidden, awaiting their moment.</p><p>A cluster of vibrant seaweed floated in the water, defying the currents.  Resembling a large cushion, three figures sat upon it, bathed in the filtered sunlight.</p><p>Using secret techniques and hidden artifacts bestowed by their clan elders, they remained invisible, even to cultivators flying overhead.</p><p>Their appearance was unusual: they had grey, pointed ears resembling those of a wolf.</p><p>One of the three men stirred, awakening from his trance. He glanced at his companions and said in a low voice, "Brothers, keep watch here. I've just remembered something and will be right back."</p><p>His two companions, startled awake, looked surprised. "The Master is setting up an array, and he ordered us to guard this place. What business does Ji have to attend to? If the Master finds out, we'll be punished…"</p><p>"The Master's plans won't be ready for some time. There's no need to worry."</p><p>He looked outward and murmured, "Several Masters are collaborating on this, and they're being so cautious. Their enemy must be incredibly powerful. If they choose to escape through here, we'll be in danger. We must prepare for the worst and get as much life-saving insurance as possible. I've been working on a protective treasure, and it's almost complete.  The three of us can use it together, making it even more powerful. However, the process is quite noisy, and it might alert the enemy. I'll go further away to finish it before the attack. Signal me if you encounter any problems."</p><p>The two exchanged glances. "Hurry back, Ji!"</p><p>He nodded, detached himself from the seaweed, silently surfaced, and vanished in a chosen direction.</p><p>Su Nu's multicolored eyes gradually returned to normal. She breathed a sigh of relief and said, "They've arrived," briefly explaining the situation.</p><p>It turned out that after discovering that unusual group, Su Nu decided to plant a spy within them. She chose a man named Ji Zhou, implanting a seed of control to manipulate him.</p><p>He was from the Quan Feng clan, a high-ranking follower of a powerful cultivator from that group, someone with access to confidential information.  For Su Nu to secretly control such a skilled person wasn't easy, as she had to avoid being detected by his master.</p><p>The control seed method worked invisibly.  Once the seed nurtured a spiritual spring within him, he would remain oblivious to his control, yet would obey Su Nu's commands without question.</p><p>Su Nu contacted him periodically to implant the seed. The spiritual spring hadn't fully formed yet. Forcing its activation would deplete its power, which was a shame, but necessary for gathering intelligence.</p><p>Unaware of his control, the man landed on a small island, his gaze vacant, lost in a daze.</p><p>Soon, Su Nu dispelled her spell and looked at Qin Sang with a strange expression.</p><p>"This man knows a lot. I found out that the two cultivators from the Celestial Division are from the Si You clan."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Su Nu's expression. "Is there something unusual about the Si You clan?"</p><p>"The world has yin and yang, but the Si You clan are both male and female!"</p><p>Some unusual insects, plants, and spirits exhibit this phenomenon, but it's rare among intelligent beings comparable to humans. Su Nu found it remarkable that she hadn't been able to determine their gender.</p><p>"Because they embody both yin and yang, the Si You clan possesses a unique ability. They have a cavity in their forehead where yin and yang interweave, a place where spiritual energy is born, allowing them to nurture and command spirit beasts.  Each Si You clan member has powerful beast companions, up to four.</p><p>"Unlike human beast masters, their companions are born from the spiritual energy in their forehead cavity and are essentially one with them. They are masters of transformation and can switch places with their beasts within a certain range, escaping danger. Unless you eliminate both the Si You member and all their beasts, it's almost impossible to kill them.</p><p>"However, this ability has limitations.  Each use temporarily dissipates a beast, requiring time to regenerate.</p><p>"The two Si You cultivators have only one beast left, hidden on a nearby island.  That group is trying to trap the beast, so they can use the transformation ability to capture them!"</p><p>()</p>
