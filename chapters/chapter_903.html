<h1>Chapter 895 Infiltration</h1><p>After leaving the shadows, the young man surnamed Fang brought out a red silk treasure. Upon activation, it transformed into a veil that draped over him, altering both his appearance and aura, turning him into a complete stranger.</p><p>The haughty look on his face quickly vanished, his cultivation level suppressed to the early stage of Core Formation. His demeanor underwent a complete transformation, making him inconspicuous.</p><p>“Please, Senior Brother Hong and Senior Brother Gao, lead the way.”</p><p>Fang cupped his hands and spoke softly.</p><p>Just then, two vacant-looking rejects from the Bullfighting Peak suddenly shuddered and slowly opened their eyes.</p><p>Alarmingly, their eyes were blood-red, with a worm-like shadow wriggling within. Fang stared at their eyes, silently chanting an incantation. The crimson in their eyes receded, the worm shadows vanished, and their gazes gradually regained their clarity. Their expressions followed suit, becoming indistinguishable from those of ordinary people.</p><p>Both turned their eyes and looked at Fang in unison.</p><p>Fang's lips moved slightly, speaking soundlessly.</p><p>“Junior Brother Fang!”</p><p>The two remained silent for a moment before whispering.</p><p>Then, they looked towards Clarity Island. The cultivator surnamed Hong bowed slightly and gestured with his hand. “Senior Brother Gao, after you.”</p><p>The other man nodded and said in a deep voice, “Follow me, Junior Brothers.”</p><p>With that, they each summoned their magical tools, transforming them into streaks of white light that pierced through the air.</p><p>To outsiders, these two looked like living cultivators. No one would suspect they were actually corpse puppets controlled by Blood Corpse Worms. Once the worms left their bodies, they would instantly become lifeless husks.</p><p>A smirk played on Fang’s lips as his figure flickered, landing behind the two puppets. He followed at a leisurely pace.</p><p>…</p><p>Clarity Island.</p><p>The disguised Fang, along with Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao, bypassed the mountain and flew towards its rear.</p><p>Apart from the earlier encounter, they met no other obstacles, much to Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao’s relief.</p><p>“Junior Sister Fang, why are you here too?”</p><p>The disguised Fang turned and asked.</p><p>Fang Ting giggled. “I wanted to witness Senior Brother Zhao’s secret technique in action. Perhaps I can learn something for my own Foundation Establishment. The other senior brothers are discussing the Dharma Assembly, and with my low cultivation, I wouldn’t gain much from listening anyway. So I came along with Senior Brother Zhao.  We were lucky I was there. If it weren't for my status, it would have been harder for Senior Brother Zhang to deceive that Senior Uncle, wouldn't it?”</p><p>Recalling the previous encounter, a blush crept onto the girl’s face.</p><p>“Indeed, thanks to Junior Sister Fang!”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao echoed.</p><p>The disguised Fang nodded slightly, but his tone was somewhat grave.  “Although we fooled that Senior Uncle, getting Senior Brother Zhao to the Dark Thunderwood Forest won’t be easy.”</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>The two were taken aback and asked in unison.</p><p>As they spoke, the trio flew into a wilderness area.</p><p>Behind the large mountain, smaller hills rolled on like mounds, covered in lush greenery. The vitality here was far richer than the outside world.</p><p>However, these were not spiritual plants.</p><p>Ever since Clarity Island's discovery, all spiritual plants outside the Star Rise Mountains had been plundered.  What remained were ordinary plants.</p><p>Amidst the dense forests, one could occasionally spot areas sealed off by restrictions. These were the places with the richest spiritual energy, most suitable for cultivating spiritual herbs.</p><p>These areas contained the previously planted spiritual plants.</p><p>Familiar with the terrain, the disguised Fang led the two through the forest, carefully avoiding those restricted areas to prevent running into Lan Dou Sect cultivators gathering herbs.</p><p>Grabbing a vine, the disguised Fang swiftly descended a cliff face, checking their direction as he spoke. “The Dark Thunderwood Forest also contains several medicinal gardens, where herbs are cultivated using the Yin Thunder energy from the forest. A senior from the Hundred Herbs Hall goes there to collect herbs and tend to the gardens. With our cultivation level, it’ll be difficult to slip past him unnoticed.  The only plan I can think of is for the two of us to distract that senior while Senior Brother Zhao seizes the opportunity to sneak into the forest.  Fortunately, your secret technique is discreet…”</p><p>Hearing this, disappointment flickered across Fang Ting’s face. She looked at Zhao Songqiao. "Senior Brother Zhao, please be careful when you infiltrate alone. Don't get discovered by that senior.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao pondered. "Junior Brother Zhang, do you know the cultivation level of that senior?"</p><p>“Mid-Core Formation.”</p><p>The disguised Fang glanced at Zhao Songqiao.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao frowned slightly, then said, “In that case, let’s proceed according to Junior Brother Zhang's plan. This concerns my future, so I will definitely be cautious.”</p><p>A glint flashed in the disguised Fang’s eyes. He smiled. “It seems Senior Brother Zhao is very confident in his evasion techniques. That puts my mind at ease.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao paused at his words, his expression unchanged. “As a rogue cultivator for so many years, I’ve naturally honed my skills in this area for survival.”</p><p>The disguised Fang nodded, saying no more and continued to lead the way.</p><p>However, a trace of doubt arose in his heart.</p><p>In truth, with the help of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, it wouldn't be difficult to slip two people past the Lan Dou Sect cultivator.</p><p>He had proposed this plan partly to observe Zhao Songqiao.  He found it odd that the man didn't seem particularly worried.</p><p>He’d been suspicious of Zhao Songqiao’s motives ever since he’d first approached him with the thunder-attracting technique. Even his original self hadn’t heard of such a method. He'd secretly used the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to investigate, but found nothing unusual and dropped the matter.</p><p>Since Zhao Songqiao had answered in such a manner, the disguised Fang naturally wouldn't press the issue. He planned to have the Heaven's Eye Butterfly follow Zhao Songqiao discreetly to see what he was really up to.</p><p>“If what he says is true, I’ll gain a secret technique and Fang Ting will owe me a favor. If he has ulterior motives and his deception implicates me, I can simply have the Heaven's Eye Butterfly eliminate him. If he’s part of a larger conspiracy that could disrupt Clarity Island and the Lan Dou Sect, my original self might be able to take advantage of the chaos, though that’s highly unlikely.”</p><p>The disguised Fang thought to himself, convinced he wouldn't lose out either way.</p><p>The Dark Thunderwood Forest wasn't far, but to avoid detection, it took them twice as long to arrive.</p><p>The disguised Fang and Fang Ting stopped before a small hill. The hill and a large area behind it were shrouded by a restrictive barrier.  The disguised Fang took out a token given to him by Jin Yan and waved it. The barrier shimmered, opening an entrance.</p><p>After stepping inside, the disguised Fang surveyed the area briefly and sent out a signal.</p><p>A shadowy figure quickly flashed in and merged with the shadows of the forest.</p><p>“Senior Brother Zhao, I’ll go and distract him. You can circle around from the side of the hill.”</p><p>The disguised Fang glanced at the shadows, gave his instructions, and headed straight for the summit with Fang Ting.</p><p>As he left, he gave a command to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.  The butterfly concealed itself, silently fluttering out and landing on a nearby tree, motionless.</p><p>Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao remained completely unaware.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao never imagined that a butterfly lurking nearby was observing his every move.</p>
