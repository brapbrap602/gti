<h1>Chapter 1947: Practicing Martial Arts</h1><p>“Steamed… buns?”</p><p>Dongjia’s lips twitched, his tone changing slightly.</p><p>It was only because Qin Sang was a valued guest invited by Qingyuan that he managed to restrain his temper.</p><p>Qingyuan chuckled and shook his head, not knowing what to say.</p><p>Dongjia remained silent for a long while. “The Seven Delicacies Feast features a dish called ‘Jade Pouch Offering Treasures.’  It uses seven precious fish from the capital's Blue Lake, ground into a fine paste.  Slices of Jade White Bamboo Shoots, thin as cicada wings, are then shaped into jade pouches, filled with the fish paste and other delicacies.  It's truly a treasure among treasures. If this doesn't suit your taste, Daoist Priest, we can prepare a separate main course for you…”</p><p>Having settled on the Seven Delicacies Feast, Dongjia went to the kitchen to oversee the preparations.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t truly meant to make things difficult for Dongjia. He simply wanted to buy some time to contemplate his next move.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body stood somewhere else, hands clasped behind his back, gazing towards Jin County.</p><p>His expression was unusually grave as he ran through the scenario again and again in his mind.</p><p>No matter how many times he replayed it, the answer remained the same—he couldn't do it!</p><p>He even doubted whether a cultivator at the late Void Refinement stage could achieve it.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t truly faced a Void Refinement cultivator in direct combat, but based on his own deductions, he could estimate their general capabilities.</p><p>Before breaking through a major realm, there wouldn't be any fundamental transformation.</p><p>Unless Qingyuan possessed some unique cultivation technique or divine ability.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lin Baoshan's cultivation was too low, the difference between him and Qingyuan was like a chasm. Based on this single encounter, he couldn't discern much more.</p><p>If Qingyuan could display such power against a Nascent Soul cultivator, that would be truly terrifying. Any cultivator using Dao Arts in his presence would have to think twice.</p><p>…</p><p>Drunken Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to wait and see, to discern Qingyuan's true purpose.</p><p>Before the main course, cold dishes were served, each made with rare ingredients seldom seen by ordinary people.  The tea served was a tribute tea from the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the serving girls, having Yu Lang pour tea and water, with Tao Teng assisting.</p><p>Qingyuan took a sip of tea and looked out the window, at the houses stretching all the way to the city walls.</p><p>The streets below bustled with activity.</p><p>The hawkers' cries, the children's laughter, the New Year's greetings, and even the sounds of arguments filled the air.</p><p>Firecrackers popped, gongs and drums clanged, and pellet drums thumped…</p><p>After Lin Baoshan left, Qin Sang removed the sound barrier, allowing all the sounds to flood into the private room, creating a lively atmosphere.</p><p>“Truly a time of celebration in the mortal world.”</p><p>Qingyuan sighed, seemingly touched. “Coming down from the mountain, Daoist Priest, don’t you find it too quiet up there?”</p><p>“Those of us who cultivate must endure solitude.  This humble Daoist descended the mountain for other reasons, and it hasn’t been long.”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke the truth, simply omitting the crucial information.</p><p>He turned to Qingyuan. “Fellow Daoist has been traveling extensively?”</p><p>“Indeed. I enjoy fine food and drink. Each region has its unique customs and flavors. Even though I’ve seen much, there are always new surprises to discover.”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled faintly, then his expression turned serious. “Unfortunately, not every place is as prosperous as the Yan Kingdom, with its people living in peace and contentment. Even within the Yan Kingdom, there is not only joy. The mortal world is inevitably filled with joys and sorrows, hardship and suffering.”</p><p>“Is it merely the mortal world?  The sea of suffering is vast, how many can cross it?”</p><p>Since Qingyuan was so inclined to conversation, Qin Sang set aside his other thoughts and echoed his sentiment.</p><p>This lament came from the depths of his heart.</p><p>If ascending to immortality meant escaping the sea of suffering, then looking at the entire Great Thousand World, how many had truly succeeded in ascending?</p><p>Every realm was a difficult hurdle, blocking countless cultivators.</p><p>“You and I, at least we are better off than those people.”</p><p>Qingyuan pointed at Qin Sang, then at himself, before suddenly turning to Yu Lang and Tao Teng, who were listening quietly.</p><p>“You are both scholars, studying the writings of sages.  People often speak of the Human Dao.  What exactly is this Great Dao of Humanity?”</p><p>Yu Lang and Tao Teng hadn't expected Qingyuan to address them, and both were startled.</p><p>In that moment, they felt an inexplicable pressure, greater than when called upon by their teacher, and couldn't help but sit up straight.</p><p>Yu Lang furrowed his brow deeply, lost in thought.</p><p>Tao Teng waited for a while, and seeing his companion silent, he boldly replied, “Between father and son, there is affection. Between ruler and minister, there is righteousness. Between husband and wife, there is distinction. Between elder and younger, there is order. Between friends, there is trust.”</p><p>Qingyuan hummed. “This can be called the Dao of Human Relations, the foundation of a nation.”</p><p>Tao Teng didn't receive the praise he expected, so he scratched his head, thought for a moment, and then recited, “When the Great Dao prevails, the world is a commonwealth.  The virtuous and able are selected to office; mutual confidence is fostered and good neighborliness cultivated. Thus, people do not regard as parents only their own parents, nor do they treat as children only their own children. Provision is secured for the aged till death, employment for the able-bodied, and the means of growing up to the young. The widow, the widower, the orphan, the childless, the disabled and the diseased are all provided for…”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled without speaking, then looked at Yu Lang.  “Young Daoist Priest seems to have a different perspective?”</p><p>Yu Lang looked at his master, then at his companion.</p><p>In this room, Tao Teng was the only mortal.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, then instead of answering, he posed a question: “Are mortals destined to be mere pawns?”</p><p>What Tao Teng spoke of, without external interference, would naturally be the ideal world imaginable.</p><p>But the world wasn't just populated by humans. There were also demons, witches, and all manner of beings, as well as the entire Great Thousand World.</p><p>Mortals without supernatural powers were like pigs and dogs, subject to slaughter at will.</p><p>Even if the mortal realm truly achieved the Great Harmony spoken of by the sages, without the ability to protect themselves, it would be like a flower in a mirror, the moon in the water.</p><p>For example, Jin County.  Without the protection of the City God and other spirits, would the city be so peaceful and harmonious today?</p><p>Could such a Human Dao truly be considered the Great Dao?</p><p>Tao Teng stared blankly at Yu Lang, somewhat confused. He couldn’t grasp the deeper meaning of the question.</p><p>Qingyuan’s eyes, however, lit up, and he burst into laughter. “To think of such things at such a young age, and it’s clear you’ve given it serious thought.  Remarkable!  The Daoist Priest has taught his disciple well. This question resonates with the worldly debate of the Greater Vehicle and the Lesser Vehicle.”</p><p>At this point, Qingyuan abruptly stopped speaking.</p><p>Then, a knock came at the door.</p><p>“Enter,” Qingyuan said.</p><p>A man dressed as an attendant gently pushed the door open and bowed first to those seated at the main table. "Greetings, gentlemen."</p><p>He then turned to Tao Teng.  “Young Master, it’s getting late. Time to go.  The Master asked me to fetch you.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Tao Teng looked reluctant.  Not only did he not want to part from his companion, but he also wanted to hear what profound insights this gentleman might offer.</p><p>His intuition told him that this gentleman, like Daoist Priest Qingfeng, was an extraordinary individual.</p><p>The attendant, however, was oblivious, urging, “Young Master, the Master is waiting for you downstairs.”</p><p>“Alas!”</p><p>Tao Teng had no choice but to sigh and rise, gripping Yu Lang’s hand tightly.  “Yu Lang, you must come find me in the capital someday!”</p><p>He then bowed to Qin Sang and Qingyuan, reluctantly following the attendant out of the room.</p><p>“The Greater Vehicle, the Lesser Vehicle…”</p><p>Both Qin Sang's true body and his avatar in the Drunken Fragrance Pavilion were momentarily lost in thought, the two terms echoing in their minds.</p><p>He felt as though he had grasped something profound.</p><p>“This Greater Vehicle is not that Greater Vehicle, although there’s likely a connection.”</p><p>Qingyuan glanced at Qin Sang and continued, “The Lesser Vehicle and the Greater Vehicle differ only in their pursuits, not in their inherent value.  To put it simply, the Lesser Vehicle cultivates oneself, while the Greater Vehicle cultivates others!”</p><p>Cultivate oneself!</p><p>Cultivate others!</p><p>It was as if a bolt of lightning had flashed through Qin Sang's mind, illuminating many of his past doubts.</p><p>The Lesser Vehicle cultivates the self, with the ultimate goal of achieving immortality and transcendence.</p><p>But what about the ultimate goal of the Greater Vehicle?</p><p>This world wasn't just populated by humans.  There were demons, witches, all living beings, and even the entire Great Thousand World.</p><p>Could it be, to bring this heaven and earth along on the journey of cultivation?</p><p>“The Divine Dao…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He had always harbored doubts about the Divine Dao.</p><p>Especially knowing that the origins of the Divine Dao might be linked to the Dao Court.</p><p>Why did some members of the Dao Court choose to cultivate the Divine Dao back then? What doctrines did they base their decision on?</p><p>Divine Dao cultivation relied on the worship of believers, which was clearly contrary to Qin Sang's understanding of the Immortal Dao.</p><p>Immortal Dao cultivation pursued ascension to immortality.</p><p>But what about the Divine Dao?</p><p>If a Divine Dao cultivator ascended alone, unable to bring their believers to the Immortal Realm, even if it didn't directly sever their faith, wouldn't it likely cause instability in the lower realm?</p><p>Unless there was free passage between the Immortal Realm and the lower realm.</p><p>Moreover, with more believers came more attachments for a Divine Dao cultivator.  How could they achieve transcendence?</p><p>So, there was a Greater Vehicle!</p><p>“The Divine Dao can be considered a Greater Vehicle, but in my opinion, its current evolution has led some Divine Dao cultivators astray. They merely see the Human Dao as sustenance for their own path, making it difficult to be considered the orthodox Human Dao. The Greater Vehicle serves all under heaven, whether cultivating merit, virtuous conduct, blessings, or even hidden virtues… Rooted in the Human Dao.  In my travels, I’ve seen glimpses of this, some even inspired by the Divine Dao, be it the Kingly Dao, the Sage Dao, or various other paths.  The future is promising. Perhaps one day, a hundred schools of thought will contend, and the true Dao will emerge from this discourse, resolving your questions, Young Daoist Priest.”</p><p>Qingyuan spoke eloquently.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't interject, nor did he want to. He simply wanted Qingyuan to continue.</p><p>The joy of hearing the Dao!</p><p>That was precisely how Qin Sang felt.</p><p>This karmic encounter had arrived suddenly and unexpectedly.</p><p>Meeting on the Dao, hearing the Dao from a stranger’s lips seemed absurd, raising concerns about potential traps.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could discern the truth in his heart. He had already had vague inklings, though they lacked a cohesive framework.</p><p>Qingyuan's discourse resonated deeply with his thoughts and provided a more comprehensive perspective.</p><p>It not only resolved many of Qin Sang’s doubts,</p><p>But even subtly touched upon his understanding of his own cultivation.</p><p>Yu Lang’s cultivation realm was insufficient to grasp the deeper meaning. He was still preoccupied with his own questions.</p><p>His thoughts couldn't be hidden from the two cultivators.</p><p>“Young Daoist Priest still seems somewhat discontented. Whether it’s the Divine Dao, the Kingly Dao, or the Sage Dao, mortals are still reliant on others, unable to truly control their own destiny. Is that not so?”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled faintly.  “You only see cultivators as the butcher’s knife and mortals as the fish on the chopping block. Do you not see that among cultivators, and even among mortals, there is also a hierarchy of strength and oppression? I wove the story of the young lady from the Yin family and the spirits of Jin County into my narrative.  What could they do to me? If everyone could cultivate, wouldn't Qi Refining cultivators become like the mortals of today?  Moreover, could the Great Thousand World even withstand it?  Have you not seen the devastation left in the wake of a locust swarm?”</p><p>Qin Sang also looked at his disciple and said gravely, “Have you forgotten your teacher's words? A person without aspirations cannot stand tall, but beware of empty talk and lofty ambitions.”</p><p>“Indeed. There’s a saying in the mortal world: ‘One does not concern oneself with matters beyond one’s station.’ To change this world… well, at least catch up to your master first.”</p><p>Qingyuan finished the water in his cup and picked up the teapot.</p><p>“This disciple humbly accepts your teachings,” Yu Lang said, as if awakening from a dream. He quickly took the teapot and filled Qingyuan and his master’s cups.</p><p>The tea flowed gently.</p><p>His thoughts seemed to have calmed, and he sat properly, his brow no longer furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qingyuan continued their previous conversation.</p><p>“In the cultivation world, the debate surrounding the Lesser and Greater Vehicles is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially within the Buddhist sects.  However, there are exceptions. For example, the Alchemy branch of the Daoist sect cultivates the Lesser Vehicle, yet possesses the magnanimity of the Greater Vehicle!”</p><p>Qingyuan's expression was filled with admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, and he finally couldn’t resist asking, “How so?”</p><p>Qingyuan picked up his folding fan and drew a large circle in the air.</p><p>“In the Great Thousand World, Five Elements spiritual energy is ubiquitous.  Cultivating through comprehension of the Five Elements is arguably the easiest path compared to others.</p><p>“Once on the path of cultivation, switching to another path is like building a bridge over a chasm. Though the bridge leads to other directions, walking on land is undoubtedly easier than directly leaping across the chasm.</p><p>“Legend has it that this bridge originated from the Alchemy branch of the Daoist sect!</p><p>“Back then, the Daoist sect combined the Five Elements, creating the Golden Core path, a direct path to the Great Dao.  Astonishingly, they then disseminated this Daoist art to the world.</p><p>“From then on, human cultivation seemed to find its foundation. Regardless of sect or school, cultivators first cultivate the Five Elements to enter the gate of cultivation, and then gradually clarify their path, pursuing their own Dao. It can be considered the foundation of all methods!</p><p>“The rise of humanity, surpassing all other races in the Great Thousand World, is largely due to the contributions of the Daoist sect!</p><p>“Five Elements spiritual roots have also become the most important criteria for judging human talent.</p><p>“The cultivation realms of the Alchemy branch—Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and even Greater Vehicle—have also spread throughout the world and become increasingly refined.</p><p>“Each breakthrough to a new realm is accompanied by a transformation, with clear guidelines that inspire confidence.  These are now revered as the gold standard.</p><p>“From this, we can see that the Alchemy sect’s naming of the final realm as ‘Greater Vehicle’ was no arbitrary decision!</p><p>“Cultivating the Dao for oneself, and spreading the Daoist art for others. What immeasurable merit!”</p><p>These words deeply moved Qin Sang.</p><p>He had read some records about the Alchemy branch in the Talisman Scripture World, knowing that it was once on par with the Talisman branch, the two most important schools of the Daoist sect.</p><p>Due to the scarcity of records, Qin Sang could only speculate that the Alchemy branch had later declined or had a disagreement with the Talisman branch, leading to their separation.</p><p>At its peak, the Talisman branch possessed astonishing power.</p><p>But Qin Sang hadn't expected the achievements of the Alchemy branch to be any less impressive!</p><p>Now, the vast majority of cultivators entered the path through the Five Elements, and they all owed a debt of gratitude to the Daoist sect!</p><p>“Food and wine are here!”</p><p>A shout came from outside the private room.</p><p>A waiter hurried to the door, knocked gently, and pushed it open, carrying a tray.</p><p>On the tray was an exquisitely prepared dish, a veritable work of art, steaming hot and emitting a rich aroma.</p><p>Instantly, the room was filled with fragrance.</p><p>The dish was a feast for the eyes, nose, and palate, stimulating the appetite.</p><p>The waiter beamed.  “The first course: Phoenix Welcomes Spring!”</p><p>Along with the dish came a pot of wine. “This is our finest Drunken Spring Breeze wine. Please enjoy, honored guests.”</p><p>The waiter bowed slightly and withdrew from the room.</p><p>Qingyuan put down his folding fan and looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>“If the Alchemy branch is such, what must the Talisman branch, once known as the Greater Vehicle Dao Sect, have been like!”</p><p>“This humble one has always yearned to know!”</p>
