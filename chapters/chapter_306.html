<h1>CHAPTER 299: IDIOT (2)</h1><p>Ge Yuan moved so quickly as if he was afraid Qin Sang would snatch it from him.</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived, Ge Yuan was standing at the edge of a pond.</p><p>At the heart of the pond, a rare flower was in full bloom.</p><p>This spiritual flower grew on the edge of the pond, surrounded by misty water vapor. It had a straight stem and a giant flower that was even bigger than an adult’s palm. Surprisingly, its petals were blue.</p><p>The sky-blue petals overlapped each other, and their color was as rich as it was pure. Spotlights of light flowed from the flower’s core, which converged into a blue pillar of light that broke through the fog.</p><p>The flower’s sweet scent was intoxicating and refreshing.</p><p>“Blue Dewdrop!”</p><p>This Blue Dewdrop seemed to be exactly what Ge Yuan needed. His eyes were intoxicated, and his face wore an expression of wild joy.</p><p>Seeing Ge Yuan’s appearance, Qin Sang stopped walking and stood at the perimeter to avoid any misunderstanding.</p><p>He had followed Ge Yuan not to compete over the spiritual medicine but to observe the place where spiritual medicine grew to see if it posed any danger.</p><p>Now he discovered there seemed to be no protective measures.</p><p>The Blue Dewdrop grew utterly alone in the depths of the pond without any guardian spirit beasts or prohibitions.</p><p>The pond water was pure and crystal clear.</p><p>Obtaining the spiritual medicine was as easy as picking it.</p><p>Seeing this flower with his own eyes, Qin Sang could immediately tell it was an absolutely mature thousand-year-old spiritual medicine.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the blue light beam. Ge Yuan was right. Among the twenty-one spiritual medicines, this one ranked near the top, but there were several with better quality!</p><p>This mountain was absolutely a massive treasure trove!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but feel excited. He was about to head toward the Profound Yellow Qi when his gaze suddenly lingered on the Blue Dewdrop.</p><p>For some unknown reason, he felt an indescribable oddity from the Blue Dewdrop.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred, and he stopped his movement. His gaze quickly swept over the surroundings, and finally, his eyes fell on the aura of spiritual medicine emitted by the Blue Dewdrop.</p><p>The blue pillar of light pierced straight through the clouds.</p><p>In the pillar of light, the spiritual medicine’s aura and fog blended together, looking like countless blue mayflies swimming, creating a beautiful and fantastic scene.</p><p>When Qin Sang followed the light’s direction and looked far into the clouds, the strange feeling lingered in his mind, yet he couldn’t find the reason.</p><p>At this time, Ge Yuan had also carried out a detailed examination and confirmed there was no danger around the Blue Dewdrop. He could no longer suppress his impatience. In a flash, he dashed over the pond and was about to pick the Blue Dewdrop.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The strange feeling surged violently when Ge Yuan approached the Blue Dewdrop. Although he didn’t know the reason, Qin Sang dared not hesitate and called out to Ge Yuan.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Ge Yuan turned his head and glared at Qin Sang. Not only did he not stop, but his movement became even faster, and without any hesitation, he reached out and grabbed the stem of the Blue Dewdrop.</p><p>At the same time, a glow lit up behind him as a short sword appeared in his hand, pointing at Qin Sang from afar.</p><p>Qin Sang saw dense vigilance, warning, and killing intent in Ge Yuan’s eyes!</p><p>Ge Yuan actually thought he was obstructing him to steal the Blue Dewdrop.</p><p>Qin Sang cursed him as an idiot and had no time to stop Ge Yuan.</p><p>Immediately afterward, an alarm suddenly arose in Qin Sang’s heart, and he looked up, his expression drastically changing.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Just as Ge Yuan’s palm was about to touch the Blue Dewdrop.</p><p>Several bolts of lightning appeared out of thin air and descended from the heavens.</p><p>The pillar of light vibrated violently as a silver net of lightning suddenly unfolded, charging straight at Ge Yuan.</p><p>All the lightning targeted the same individual—Ge Yuan!</p><p>Deafening thunder rang out as an extremely terrifying aura of destruction enveloped him.</p><p>Since Qin Sang was standing farther away, he was fine. Ge Yuan was the sole target of these lightning bolts, and a sense of fear of death welled up in him at that moment.</p><p>Only then did Ge Yuan realize that Qin Sang’s obstruction wasn’t to compete over the spiritual medicine but because he had truly discovered something.</p><p>He could only blame the fact that the spiritual medicine’s protective prohibition was too well-hidden. They had examined it carefully but failed to notice anything unusual. And at the moment he saw the spiritual herb he had longed for, his heart was captured by it, leading to this grave mistake.</p><p>It was too late for regrets. These lightning bolts were too terrifying. Ge Yuan activated the short sword to try and resist, but the top-grade Dharma artifact didn’t last a single breath before being destroyed by the lightning, turning into dust, making him panic.</p><p>If he were hit by the lightning, there was only one possible outcome: death!</p><p>At this moment, he was only an inch away from picking the spiritual medicine, but he couldn’t reach it at all.</p><p>Ge Yuan's face was filled with deep resentment, but in the end, he did not reach for it. No matter how precious the spirit medicine was, it would be worthless without his life.</p><p>"Thud!"</p><p>Ge Yuan stomped on the water's surface and retreated swiftly.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang, not caring whether Ge Yuan lived or died, decisively turned and rushed down the mountain.</p><p>Ge Yuan had triggered the spirit medicine's defense mechanism. The sound of lightning must have alerted Luo Xingnan and the others. Ge Yuan's cover was blown, so he might still have a chance.</p><p>As expected, the battle on the mountaintop suddenly came to an abrupt halt as the spirit medicine's defense mechanism was triggered. The cries of the demonic beasts immediately became extremely frenzied.</p><p>"Hoo-hoo..."</p><p>As the hurricane rose, a few colossal figures could vaguely be seen rushing over amid the swirling clouds.</p><p>Simultaneously, Luo Xingnan's furious cries echoed through the air, "Who are these vile thieves!?"</p><p>Before the sound of his voice had died down, a piercing shriek tore through the clouds. A jade fork-shaped magical artifact arrived even faster than the demonic beasts, reaching them in an instant.</p><p>Ge Yuan, who was being pursued by lightning, was already exhausted and struggling to escape. When he saw the jade fork刺 coming at him, he was so terrified that he barely managed to dodge the fatal blow. However, he was still struck by the spiritual energy carried on the jade fork and sent flying like a rolling gourd.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The jade fork plunged straight into the water.</p><p>The water splashed in all directions, and the spiritual energy fluctuations spread far and wide.</p><p>Close behind the jade fork came a group of gigantic birds. Their wingspans reached several meters, and their bodies were covered in black feathers.</p><p>Strangely, their heads were not those of birds but rather resembled human heads, complete with facial features. Their mouths, however, still resembled bird beaks, and when they opened and closed, they let out bird-like cries, giving them an eerie appearance.</p><p>Human-headed birds!</p><p>At the same time, several figures flew over.</p><p>Qin Sang's body stiffened, and he gave a wry smile inwardly as he abandoned the idea of continuing to hide.</p><p>There were no obstacles on the mountain path. From the moment the mechanism was triggered to the present, only an instant had passed. Luo Xingnan and the others had already arrived, leaving him no chance to escape.</p><p>Lan Ludan's defense mechanism seemed to exist only to protect the spirit medicine. After deterring Ge Yuan, the lightning gradually dissipated.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's sinister gaze swept over the two of them, and he sneered, "So, it's you two good-for-nothing thieves working together. You must have had unbelievably good luck to break through and enter! You have some guts to steal medicine right under this old man's nose!"</p><p>Ge Yuan was under Shengyuanzi's command, and Qin Sang followed Youkong. Luo Xingnan still remembered them.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the disheveled Ge Yuan and exchanged helpless glances with Youkong.</p><p>Chapter 299: The Fool (Part Two)</p><p>Ge Yuan, as if afraid Qin Sang would snatch it from him, moved with incredible speed.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang arrived, Ge Yuan was standing at the edge of a pool.</p><p>A wondrous flower bloomed in the depths of the pool.</p><p>This spiritual flower grew at the pool's edge, surrounded by swirling mist. Its stem was straight, and its blossom was enormous, larger than an adult's hand, and a brilliant blue.</p><p>Sky-blue petals overlapped, their color rich and pure. The flower's pistil emitted a sparkling, dust-like brilliance, converging into a beam of blue light that pierced the dense fog.</p><p>A refreshing fragrance filled the air, invigorating the mind.</p><p>"Blue Dew昙!"</p><p>This Blue Dew昙 seemed to be precisely what Ge Yuan sought. His eyes were glazed over, his face filled with ecstasy.</p><p>Seeing Ge Yuan's state, Qin Sang stopped at the periphery to avoid any misunderstanding.</p><p>He had followed, not to compete for the spiritual herb, but to observe the environment where such herbs grew, to assess any potential dangers.</p><p>Now, it seemed, there were no protective measures at all.</p><p>The Blue Dew昙 grew alone in the depths of the pool, with no guardian spirit beasts or restrictive formations.</p><p>The pool water was pure and crystal clear.</p><p>The herb was within easy reach.</p><p>Upon seeing the flower, Qin Sang immediately recognized it as a mature, thousand-year-old spiritual herb.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the blue light. Ge Yuan was right; it ranked high among the twenty-one spiritual herbs, but several others were even more potent!</p><p>This mountain was undoubtedly a treasure trove!</p><p>Excitement surged within Qin Sang, and he was about to set off towards the Primal Yellow Qi when he paused, his gaze lingering on the Blue Dew昙.</p><p>He felt a strange, inexplicable sensation emanating from the flower.</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang stopped, his eyes scanning the area, finally settling on the spiritual aura radiating from the Blue Dew昙.</p><p>The blue beam of light reached towards the sky.</p><p>Within the beam, the herb's aura mingled with the fog, like countless blue mayflies dancing within, creating a breathtaking scene.</p><p>As Qin Sang's gaze followed the light into the depths of the fog, the strange feeling persisted, though he couldn't discern its cause.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ge Yuan, having confirmed the absence of danger around the Blue Dew昙, could no longer contain himself.  He darted across the pool's surface, reaching for the flower's stem.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The instant Ge Yuan neared the Blue Dew昙, the strange feeling intensified. Though unsure of the reason, Qin Sang didn't hesitate, urgently calling out to Ge Yuan.</p><p>However, Ge Yuan turned, casting a hostile glance at Qin Sang. Instead of stopping, he accelerated, his hand reaching for the Blue Dew昙.</p><p>Simultaneously, a light flashed behind him, and a short sword appeared, pointed at Qin Sang.</p><p>In Ge Yuan's eyes, Qin Sang saw suspicion, warning, and killing intent! He believed Qin Sang was trying to steal the Blue Dew昙.</p><p>Qin Sang cursed him inwardly as a fool. It was too late to stop him.</p><p>Suddenly, a sense of foreboding washed over Qin Sang. He looked up, his face paling.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Just as Ge Yuan's hand was about to touch the Blue Dew昙, several bolts of lightning appeared out of nowhere, descending from the sky.</p><p>The beam of light vibrated violently, and a shimmering electrical net unfurled, snapping towards Ge Yuan.</p><p>All the lightning bolts converged on a single target: Ge Yuan!</p><p>Amidst the deafening thunder, a terrifying aura of destruction enveloped him.</p><p>Qin Sang, being further away, felt less of the impact, but Ge Yuan, the lightning's sole target, was seized by a fear of death.</p><p>Ge Yuan finally understood. Qin Sang hadn't tried to stop him out of greed but because he had sensed danger.</p><p>The protective formation around the herb was too well-hidden. They had checked carefully but failed to detect it.  Blinded by the sight of the long-sought herb, Ge Yuan had made a grave error.</p><p>Regret was too late. The lightning was too powerful.  He urged his short sword forward in an attempt to defend himself, but the high-grade magical artifact shattered instantly, turning to dust, leaving him aghast.</p><p>Being struck by the lightning meant only one thing: death!</p><p>His hand was inches from the herb, but he couldn't reach it.</p><p>Intense frustration flashed across Ge Yuan's face. In the end, he dared not extend his hand.  No matter how precious the herb, it was worthless without life to enjoy it.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Ge Yuan stomped on the water's surface, his body retreating rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang, disregarding Ge Yuan's fate, turned and fled down the mountain.</p><p>The commotion from the triggered formation couldn't be hidden from Luo Xingnan and the others. Ge Yuan was exposed, but Qin Sang might still have a chance.</p><p>As expected, the moment the formation was triggered, the battle at the summit paused. Then, the roars of the beasts intensified drastically.</p><p>‘Whoosh… ’</p><p>A hurricane erupted, the fog swirling. Several enormous figures emerged, diving towards the pool.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's furious roar echoed: "Who are these thieves!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, a piercing shriek tore through the fog. A jade, fork-like artifact, faster than the beasts, arrived in an instant.</p><p>Ge Yuan, pursued by lightning, was already struggling.  The sight of the approaching jade fork filled him with terror. He narrowly avoided being impaled, but the spiritual energy radiating from the fork struck him, sending him tumbling.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The jade fork plunged into the pool.</p><p>Water splashed, and waves of spiritual energy rippled outwards.</p><p>The beasts arrived close behind the fork. They were a flock of massive birds, their black wings concealing bodies several meters long.</p><p>Their heads were not bird-like but resembled human heads, complete with facial features, though their mouths were still beaks, opening and closing with bird-like screeches, creating a grotesque appearance.</p><p>Human-headed birds!</p><p>[Reader Benefits] Read and get cash or points, and a chance to win an iPhone12 or Switch!

He abandoned any hope of hiding.</p><p>There were no obstacles on the mountain. From the moment the formation was triggered, only a blink of an eye had passed before Luo Xingnan and the others arrived. There was no chance to escape.</p><p>The Blue Dew昙's protective formation, seemingly designed only to guard the herb, dissipated after repelling Ge Yuan.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's cold gaze swept over the two men. He sneered, "So it's you two thieves working together. You stumbled into this place by sheer luck!  How dare you try to steal herbs right under my nose!"</p><p>Ge Yuan served under Sheng Yuanzi, and Qin Sang followed Yu Kong.  Luo Xingnan remembered them.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the disheveled Ge Yuan and exchanged a look with Yun Youzi.  Both felt a sense of helplessness.</p>
