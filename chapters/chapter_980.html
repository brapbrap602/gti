<h1>Chapter 972: Scales</h1><p>The smoke cleared.</p><p>A multicolored light flickered, revealing Jiu Feng Wang’s somewhat disheveled figure.  Jiu Feng Wang appeared only slightly injured.  Her gaze swept across the scene, taking in only the lingering embers of blood and fire, each a testament to a life lost.</p><p>After a long moment, Jiu Feng Wang turned and left, a barely audible sigh echoing in the void.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, caught in a hurricane, felt the world spin as he was tossed about, his senses reeling. He fought desperately, struggling to break free from the raging winds. He had no idea where the hurricane had carried him.</p><p>During the attack on Jiu Feng Wang, Qin Sang's Heavenly Eye ability had perceived a strange expression on Jiu Feng Wang’s face.  Always decisive, he didn't hesitate. Abandoning his ebony sword, he unleashed his most powerful technique, the “Sacrifice Lightning Art”.</p><p>Indeed, the moment he made his decision, Jiu Feng Wang blew on her jade flute, and a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Seeing the terrible state of Yuan Zhu and the other demons, Qin Sang realized that killing Jiu Feng Wang was impossible.  Unwilling to die with them, his mind raced, desperately searching for an escape.</p><p>Secretly mobilizing his true energy, Qin Sang also manifested blood fire on his body, feigning being affected by the jade flute.</p><p>At the last moment, Qin Sang made a bold decision and leaped into a grey hurricane – the only escape he could think of, though it was akin to drinking poison to quench his thirst.</p><p>Within the storm zone, being caught in a grey hurricane was incredibly dangerous.  The hurricanes in this zone possessed the power of heaven and earth; their destructive force was far beyond anything in the outside world. Even if he survived and escaped, he had no idea where he would end up.  If he lost his way in the storm zone, death was inevitable.</p><p>But in that situation, Qin Sang had no other choice.  If captured by Jiu Feng Wang, death would be a mercy.  Leaping into the hurricane offered, perhaps, a sliver of hope.</p><p>To avoid arousing Jiu Feng Wang's suspicion, Qin Sang secretly summoned the Red Yuan Shawl to conceal his aura and feign death. Unexpectedly, the shawl proved far more fragile than he anticipated, shattering after only a few breaths.</p><p>Fortunately, before the shawl disintegrated, Qin Sang successfully plunged into a colossal hurricane, akin to a true dragon, and quickly swallowed a drop of the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>The liquid was precious, but he had no choice.</p><p>“Whoosh… whoosh…”</p><p>Qin Sang tumbled within the hurricane, unable to maintain his footing.  All around him was a hazy grey, obscuring his vision.  He felt dizzy and his whole body ached.</p><p>Immense pressure bore down from all sides. Qin Sang had already summoned his external avatar, and the two clung together, jointly resisting the hurricane's onslaught.</p><p>Qin Sang had been prepared to sacrifice his avatar to save himself, but thankfully Jiu Feng Wang didn't pursue him, proving his disguise had deceived her.</p><p>The time since he’d leapt into the hurricane was short, yet Qin Sang had no idea where he’d been carried.  He was desperate to escape.  If he were swept into the heart of the storm zone and couldn’t find his way back, he would undoubtedly die. That area was dangerous enough to lose even a Nascent Soul Grandmaster.</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid infused his meridians with abundant spiritual energy.  Qin Sang ordered his avatar to help shield him from the pressure, while he focused on refining the liquid.  His true energy quickly replenished.  Without delay, Qin Sang searched frantically for a weak point in the hurricane.</p><p>Using the ebony sword as a guide, Qin Sang and his avatar struggled to break through.</p><p>The interior of the hurricane was chaotic.  Facing countless gales, they barely managed to avoid being scattered; otherwise, they would have been separated by miles in an instant.</p><p>The hurricane was like a blade.</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Coffin armor creaked, marked by countless scratches from the ethereal winds.</p><p>Qin Sang used his sword energy for protection, but he still suffered cuts, his body quickly becoming covered in blood.</p><p>“Break for me!”</p><p>Qin Sang roared.</p><p>The sword wheel reappeared.</p><p>After the sharpening from the Sword Path, the sword wheel’s power was somewhat stronger than before he entered the Seven Killing Hall, but against the terrifying hurricane, it was still like a drop in the ocean.</p><p>Then Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag, ignoring his complaints about Qin Sang, and mobilized his still-recovering corpse energy, forming it into a sharp spear to pierce forward.</p><p>The two-headed demonic beast also emerged, its shadow quivering.</p><p>The three beings and the beast huddled together, pushing outwards with renewed effectiveness.</p><p>After pushing forward a certain distance, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The blood sword, a manifestation of Qin Sang's power, shattered.  Already weakened from its fight with Qingzhu and battered by the hurricane, it could endure no more.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang, with a thought, made the blood sword self-destruct with a muffled groan from his manifestation.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The exploding sword was instantly swept away by the hurricane.  Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang surged forward, finally feeling the pressure lessen as he reached the edge of the storm.</p><p>The hurricane was unpredictable, the timing fleeting.  The three cultivators and their beast companion, pushing their spiritual energy to its limit, charged through, bursting into the clear.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>A massive wave crashed over them, sending the group sprawling before they regained their footing.  The surrounding landscape remained the same apocalyptic scene, unchanged from before.</p><p>"You're a walking disaster!  You must have committed terrible sins in a past life!" Bai exclaimed angrily, his finger almost touching Qin Sang's face.  Weak and exhausted from the exertion, he retreated to his corpse puppet bag to recuperate, leaving Qin Sang to clean up the mess.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, inwardly grumbling that he hadn't summoned these Yuan Ying cultivators.  The repeated encounters made him wonder if he was simply having terrible luck.</p><p>The two-headed beast, Kui, settled into the Hun Yuan Tong Xin ring to sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang checked his and his manifestation's injuries.  He was fine, but his manifestation was badly hurt and needed to return to the Heavenly Corpse Coffin.</p><p>Gazing out at the endless wind and waves, Qin Sang felt lost. He had no idea where he was, couldn't even discern direction.  Lost and adrift, he wondered how long it would take to find a way out, fearing he might perish here.</p><p>He quickly produced a jade talisman, his heart sinking. It remained inert, indicating he was far from the Seven Killing Hall.  The talisman would help him find his way back, but the Hall was about to close.  Once the Grand Shaman withdrew the spirit array, the talisman would be useless.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang didn't delay, choosing a random direction and fleeing, relying entirely on chance.</p><p>While searching for the Seven Killing Hall, he took out another item – a small, green scale, resembling a dragon scale but no larger than a baby's palm. Yuan Zhu had secretly given it to him before entering the cave, but hadn't explained its use.</p><p>Qin Sang held the scale, his gaze flickering.  He recalled the last moments before entering the hurricane, the horrifying scene of Yuan Zhu, Gu Heng, and the Caiyi Fairy engulfed in fire.  He’d seen a beast ripped to shreds by the hurricane’s power.  The chances of Yuan Zhu surviving were practically nil.  What use could this scale possibly be?</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Finally complete.</p>
