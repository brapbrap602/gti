<h1>Chapter 1154: Forming the Nascent Soul </h1><p>Within the Purple Mansion.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Armor had long been torn apart by the raging winds. The golden light of the Jade Buddha shone brightly, steadfastly blocking the winds and protecting Qin Sang's primordial spirit. He could have allowed the winds to enter, just as before, to temper his spirit and gain benefits.</p><p>But Qin Sang chose not to.</p><p>First, after forming his Nascent Soul, he would likely be able to cultivate the "Seed of Fire and Golden Lotus," so he wouldn't lack opportunities for tempering.</p><p>Second, Qin Sang had an ominous premonition—something might change with the Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was extremely grave. Ignoring the howling winds, he opened his eyes and gazed intently at the heavens.</p><p>Yun Youzi was a fusion of a demon's and a human's soul.</p><p>But Qin Sang was not. His situation was closer to a soul possession.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Yun Youzi once saying that one must pass this tribulation to gain the recognition of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Could it be that those who possess another's body are despised by the Heavenly Dao, rejected by heaven and earth, and seen as defying the natural order? During their first Heavenly Tribulation, the power of the tribulation would surge, and they must overcome this hurdle?</p><p>Fail, and their body perishes, their Dao dissipates.</p><p>Succeed, and it would be akin to a rebirth, earning the recognition of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Or was it only anomalies like him and Yun Youzi who would face such a trial?</p><p>These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he quickly suppressed them. Overthinking was futile now. He had to muster all his strength to face the Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The power of the winds grew stronger, but they could not shake the Jade Buddha. After reaching their peak, the winds finally scattered.</p><p>Outside, the others also noticed something unusual.</p><p>Li Yufu recalled the similar scene during Yun Youzi's tribulation and felt a sense of foreboding. He hurriedly flew to Bai's side, his face filled with panic.</p><p>"Senior..."</p><p>Bai shook his head, his gaze fixed on the tribulation clouds, saying nothing.</p><p>Finally, the winds dissipated.</p><p>The tribulation clouds gathered, the dark clouds transforming into tribulation clouds. Arcs of lightning, like coiling dragons, darted through the clouds. Countless bolts of lightning converged, and the tribulation clouds visibly expanded.</p><p>Gradually, the lightning within the clouds turned azure—the Heavenly Tribulation Lightning had appeared!</p><p>Bai and Li Yufu stared intently at the center of the tribulation clouds, fearing a repeat of the tragedy, hoping no golden or other-colored lightning would appear. Fortunately, as the azure lightning filled the clouds and the tribulation clouds took shape, no anomalies emerged.</p><p>Li Yufu's heart was in his throat.</p><p>He even began to suspect that Qin Sang might share a similar origin with Yun Youzi. Otherwise, why would their bond be so strong? Such friendships were rare in the cultivation world.</p><p>"Thank goodness, thank goodness..."</p><p>Seeing only a single-colored tribulation cloud, Li Yufu's tension eased slightly.</p><p>Bai said gravely, "Each person's tribulation is not entirely the same. Your martial uncle might have done something that caused the Wind Tribulation to mutate. However, the strength of the Heavenly Tribulation Lightning is still uncertain..."</p><p>Before he could finish—</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Thunder roared within the tribulation clouds, and in an instant, a bolt of Heavenly Tribulation Lightning formed. The moment it appeared, it pierced through the void like a sword, descending with unstoppable force!</p><p>On the small island.</p><p>The protective formation created a glowing barrier.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation Lightning struck the barrier fiercely, causing it to tremble violently. It absorbed part of the lightning's power before being torn apart.</p><p>Qin Sang had already summoned the Ebony Wood Sword. With a thought, the sword split into dozens of sword lights, swirling upward to annihilate the remnants of the lightning.</p><p>The barrier flickered a few times before reforming.</p><p>Having witnessed the power of Yun Youzi's Heavenly Tribulation, Qin Sang compared it to his own and felt that his tribulation lightning was not as powerful as the two-colored lightning. Perhaps he had overthought things.</p><p>The tribulation clouds showed no sign of stopping, and the lightning fell like rain.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword darted about, actively attacking and dispersing the lightning that penetrated the formation.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly also flew out from Qin Sang's dantian, landing on his shoulder.</p><p>The Nine-Life Mystic Tortoise's shell covered Qin Sang's body, serving as his final defense against the scattered lightning threads.</p><p>Qin Sang tried releasing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, allowing it to devour the lightning threads in hopes of enhancing its abilities. The Heavenly Tribulation did not mutate as a result.</p><p>The Witch Clan's grand inheritance indeed had its merits. The life-bound insect gu was one with him and was not seen as an external aid by the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang nodded slightly and then focused entirely on facing the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The thunder roared incessantly, drowning out all other sounds. Qin Sang's vision was filled with blinding azure lightning.</p><p>Wave after wave of Heavenly Tribulation Lightning struck, each more terrifying than the last. The formation's barrier was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>At first, the Ebony Wood Sword's sword lights were barely enough to cope. Now, Qin Sang had already taken a pill to restore his true essence and was forced to deploy a sword formation to withstand the lightning.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Another bolt of lightning.</p><p>The tribulation clouds remained thick and heavy, showing no sign of ending.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He formed a sword seal, and the sword formation suddenly erupted with a pillar of light, shooting upward to counter the lightning!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Finally, the protective formation reached its limit and could hold no longer. The array tools turned to ash.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation Lightning broke through the sword formation's defense, carrying its residual power as it surged toward Qin Sang's crown. Qin Sang snorted coldly and instantly activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation. His wings flapped, and his figure shot upward, his fists swinging with immense force.</p><p>In an instant, countless fist shadows filled the air.</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>With a loud shout, the Heavenly Tribulation Lightning shattered.</p><p>The void lit up as if it were daytime, and a figure appeared in mid-air, bathed in lightning.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze at this moment. Qin Sang's fists were enveloped in azure light as he shattered the Heavenly Tribulation Lightning!</p><p>However, the tribulation clouds were not impressed by his display. The lightning continued to strike relentlessly.</p><p>Relying on his formidable physique and the sword formation, Qin Sang repeatedly dispersed the lightning. Like a demon god, he was knocked down time and again, only to rise and charge back toward the tribulation clouds, battling the Heavenly Tribulation with unyielding determination.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang finally sensed something amiss.</p><p>Although his Heavenly Tribulation was not a two-colored one, the number of lightning strikes he had endured already surpassed what Yun Youzi had faced, and it still showed no sign of ending.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. Seizing a brief respite between lightning strikes, he took another pill and continued to endure. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly also used its abilities to aid its master in overcoming the tribulation.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation Lightning grew stronger with each strike, but Qin Sang shattered them one after another.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The thunder within the tribulation clouds roared like the fury of the heavens, enraged by this stubborn insect.</p><p>At that moment, the tribulation clouds suddenly stopped rotating. A dense azure light erupted, and all the lightning power coalesced into a single bolt, unleashing a final, deafening roar.</p><p>"The final strike!"</p><p>Seeing the massive lightning pillar flash toward him, Qin Sang's heart tightened. To ensure his safety, he swallowed a Mist Origin Pill. With a flick of his finger, the Twelve Demon Banners leaped from the ground, instantly forming an array.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Flames blazed fiercely, shielding Qin Sang from above.</p><p>The next moment, the Heavenly Tribulation Lightning collided with the demonic flames!</p><p>*Sizzle!*</p><p>The two forces clashed and neutralized each other. The demonic flames were the first to give way, torn apart by the lightning.</p><p>The residual power was still formidable. Qin Sang let out a roar, pushing the Heavenly Demon Transformation to its limit. His veins bulged, his bones cracked, and he struck the lightning with all his might!</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Dust and smoke erupted, and the mountain peak was sheared off a layer. Qin Sang, now blackened all over, flipped to his feet.</p><p>There was still the Heart Demon Tribulation to face. Ignoring his injuries, he quickly sat down to focus his spirit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, no Heart Demon seemed to appear.</p><p>Everything was normal.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly sensed Li Yufu and the others rushing toward him, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of confusion.</p><p>***</p>
