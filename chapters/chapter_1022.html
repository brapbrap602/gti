<h1>Chapter 1114: Wind Extremity Nails</h1><p>Chapter 1114: Wind Extremity Nails</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess lightly tapped her foot, transforming into a streak of light that soared upward.</p><p>Elder Fang and the other cultivators followed closely behind.</p><p>Before long, they arrived at the mysterious valley.</p><p>The valley was silent, devoid of any figures.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess swept her gaze across the valley, then flashed into its deepest part, arriving before an ancient restriction between two sheer cliffs.</p><p>The valley was pitch-black, like a black hole.</p><p>Black light was composed of countless slender threads, extensions of the ancient restrictions in the cliffs on both sides.  These threads crisscrossed, sealing off the valley entrance.</p><p>The threads were thin and not solid objects.</p><p>Human cultivators turned pale with fear, not daring to approach them by a hair's breadth.</p><p>Many cultivators had lost their lives here.</p><p>Fortunately, the ancient restriction wouldn't harm anyone unless they actively intruded.</p><p>"The Sky Tower is clearly the ruins of an ancient Human sword cultivator sect. Why would a Witch Clan treasure be hidden here?"</p><p>Standing before the ancient restriction, Elder Fang still had doubts.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess stared intently at the depths of the ancient restriction, saying calmly, "Who can say for sure whether the Human and Witch Clans were enemies or friends in ancient times?  The Seven Killing Hall contains not only the ruins of ancient Human cultivators, but also traces of the Witch and Demon Clans.  Our ability to directly cultivate Human cultivation methods speaks volumes.  Furthermore, while Human cultivators are helpless against these restrictions, we of the Witch Clan may not be."</p><p>With that, the Grand Witch Priestess flipped her palm, revealing two black, nail-shaped treasures.</p><p>She infused them with True Qi.</p><p>The nails glowed faintly green from the inside out, revealing countless green runes.</p><p>Simultaneously, tiny whirlwinds gathered at the tips of the nails, gradually turning green.</p><p>"Last time, I faced grave danger inside and gained nothing because I couldn't shake off Ling Zhuzi. He watched me menacingly, so I couldn't use these Wind Extremity Nails and had to resort to other methods... These treasures are ideally suited to counteract this restriction."</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess flicked her fingers. "Go!"</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The two nails were driven into the cliff walls on either side, disappearing completely.</p><p>The stone walls trembled violently.</p><p>The black light within seemed like streams of black water, threatening to overflow.</p><p>A sudden gale swept through the valley, centered on the two Wind Extremity Nails.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess formed hand seals, exerting all her strength to activate the treasures.</p><p>The black light in the stone walls gradually subsided, and the chaotic threads in the valley began to fade, eventually disappearing completely.</p><p>In an instant, the dense black threads became much thinner than before. Although still dangerous, it was no longer difficult for the Grand Witch Priestess and her companions to pass through.</p><p>Even for someone as strong as the Grand Witch Priestess, this task proved strenuous.</p><p>She turned to the two elders behind her. "Elder Wind, Elder Moon, please guard this place and prevent Human cultivators from taking the Wind Extremity Nails."</p><p>"Rest assured, Grand Witch Priestess, we will guard this place to the death!"</p><p>The elders said gravely.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess said softly, "You don't need to guard to the death. If you spot Human cultivators and we haven't returned, take the Wind Extremity Nails and hide. Return after they've left."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>One elder sat cross-legged, while the other flew out of the valley to stand guard.</p><p>Having made her arrangements, the Grand Witch Priestess nodded to Elder Fang and, with her remaining companions, stepped into the restriction.</p><p>The black threads remained chaotic and dangerous. The Grand Witch Priestess and her group carefully navigated the gaps between the threads, proceeding deeper into the valley.</p><p>The valley was far larger than they had imagined.</p><p>The ground was bare rock, and the top was out of sight. They seemed to be in an extremely deep canyon, surrounded only by black threads and nothing else.</p><p>The Grand Witch Priestess and Elder Fang led the way, with the others silently following behind.</p><p>They spread out to avoid anyone accidentally triggering the restriction and endangering others.</p><p>After walking for a while, the Grand Witch Priestess paused, surveyed her surroundings, and ran a hand across her waist, producing a dark stone disc with simple symbols carved on its surface.</p><p>Holding the disc in one hand, she chanted an incomprehensible incantation.</p><p>Soon, an exquisitely detailed tattoo appeared on her snow-white wrist.</p><p>Elder Fang and the others showed no surprise at this sight.</p><p>These tattoos symbolized divine runes, the true power of the Witch Clan, like their innate insect gu, representing their true heritage.</p><p>Unfortunately, the divine runes were limited, reaching at most the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>All the Witch Clan experts present had delved deeply into the divine runes, but all had failed without exception.</p><p>The innate insect gu, however, held promise, with some forging an unprecedented path through it.</p><p>At this thought, several Witch Clan cultivators subconsciously glanced at Elder Fang.</p><p>Elder Fang's abandonment of his human body to merge with the insect gu body was truly shocking. However, if there was a high probability of breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, many would undoubtedly be willing to do the same.</p><p>After a period of activity, Old Master Fang became very mysterious.  For years he's been secluded in Ling Chan Cave, and hasn't taken on any disciples.</p><p>One wonders if, after Old Master Fang's passing, his research and secret techniques will be made public and passed on.</p><p>Old Master Fang remained silent, awaiting the Great Shaman's actions.</p><p>'Ding!'</p><p>The stone disc trembled slightly in the Great Shaman's hand.</p><p>The Great Shaman used her power of divine runes.  Countless rain-like threads suddenly appeared around her, creating a misty scene.</p><p>This seemingly beautiful image of a woman in the rain was occurring within a perilous ancient restriction.</p><p>These rain-like threads narrowly avoided the black lines, causing fear in the onlookers.  Their delicate dance, without ever touching the black lines, demonstrated the Great Shaman's incredible control.</p><p>'Drip…drip…’</p><p>The rain-like threads fell into the stone disc. The strange symbols inside seemed to come alive; the disc became like a vast lake, with huge waves surging.</p><p>The Great Shaman gently stirred the disc with her finger.</p><p>The waves in the disc surged towards one side, reaching the edge and attempting to spill out, but unable to escape.</p><p>Seeing this, the Great Shaman looked in that direction and said, "It's there!"</p><p>Everyone immediately set off.</p><p>The Great Shaman, holding the disc, led the way.</p><p>Old Master Fang circled the perimeter, maintaining vigilance and preventing any unforeseen incidents that might disturb the Great Shaman.</p><p>They walked for a while.</p><p>Everyone's faces showed surprise.</p><p>Before them, the black lines of the restriction had vanished, revealing a circular stone hall. There was no signboard, nor any inscription.</p><p>The hall was weathered, radiating an ancient aura, clearly not of this world.</p><p>After a brief inspection, they found the entrance: a huge, rectangular stone block.</p><p>The block resembled a giant stele, standing before them as the hall's door.</p><p>In the center of the block was a circular recess.</p><p>Understanding dawned on them, and their gazes fell upon the stone disc in the Great Shaman's hand – the recess was the same size.</p><p>The Great Shaman pondered for a moment, took a step forward, and instead of immediately placing the disc, reached out and gently touched the stele, carefully sensing the restriction within the stone hall.</p>
