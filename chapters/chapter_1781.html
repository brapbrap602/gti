<h1>Chapter 1772: The Tao Heng Mountain Lineage</h1><p>Jushan Province.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating in seclusion within a certain cave dwelling.</p><p>Having weathered this thunder tribulation, he would have three hundred years of peaceful cultivation.  He could now concentrate on seeking a Dharma Lineage.</p><p>He circulated his cultivation technique, healing the injuries inflicted by the thunder tribulation.</p><p>Thanks to his powerful regenerative abilities, these injuries were swiftly mending, yet Qin Sang gradually perceived something unusual.</p><p>His physical body had inexplicably become much stronger!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but be taken aback.  After his breakthrough, he had been wholly absorbed in comprehending two divine abilities, neglecting his physical cultivation.  Logically, there shouldn't have been such a significant improvement.</p><p>"Could it be…"</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Qin Sang's mind.  He recalled the moment when the grey heavenly tribulation struck his body during the tribulation, a peculiar energy seemed to seep into him.</p><p>At that time, he had to concentrate on surviving the tribulation, so he hadn't noticed the anomaly and hadn't paid it any mind.</p><p>Could this grey tribulation lightning actually bring about a transformation for him?</p><p>For cultivators, every heavenly tribulation was a perilous trial, but also an opportunity.</p><p>Yet, gaining such immense benefits from a heavenly tribulation was a first for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang soon discovered that the improvement wasn't limited to his physical strength; his Nascent Soul and Primordial Spirit seemed to have undergone changes as well.</p><p>It was a comprehensive transformation.  To forcibly describe it, he was now closer to the Great Dao. His previous comprehension of the Great Dao had been biased and incomplete, but now it had been perfected.  The benefits were self-evident.</p><p>"Do all cultivators who ascend from Small Thousand Worlds have to experience this?  Although dangerous, as long as one can survive it, it's equivalent to receiving the recognition and bestowment of this world's Heavenly Dao. I wonder if future heavenly tribulations will also mutate…"  Qin Sang mused.</p><p>This further reinforced his belief that he had already entered a Great Thousand World, possibly landing in a secluded corner of it.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly recalled the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Having devoured so much tribulation lightning, would the butterfly also gain a fortuitous encounter like him?</p><p>Qin Sang focused his consciousness on his dantian, seeing the Heaven's Eye Butterfly perched quietly on his Nascent Soul's shoulder.  He carefully called out to it, but the butterfly's response was somewhat sluggish.</p><p>"Is it still digesting the tribulation lightning…?"  Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly was at the peak of its fourth transformation, on the cusp of a breakthrough.  If it could benefit from the heavenly tribulation's essence, it should be greatly advantageous for its advancement.</p><p>Of course, the Azure Frost Pill still needed to be refined, and he was currently gathering information about the Hundred-Jointed Earth Bamboo.</p><p>…</p><p>Jushan Province, Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling, rested briefly, and set off once more, his destination being the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>This journey was a plan Qin Sang had made before the tribulation.  Firstly, he had a prior agreement with True Person Zhijian. Secondly, as a gathering place for cultivator factions in Jushan Province, the Star Island Immortal Lake was where he was most likely to obtain the information he sought.</p><p>He intended to explore the Star Island Immortal Lake on his way to visit True Person Zhijian, so he didn't inform True Person Guzhou and set off alone.</p><p>The western part of Jushan Province was an area completely controlled by the Dao Court.  Sermon City was the easternmost immortal city in this region, its name a testament to the Dao Court's high hopes for it.</p><p>Traveling westward from Crane Cry Mountain to Sermon City, one could take a teleportation formation back to White Stone Province. Qin Sang had been to this city before when he visited Master Lingxu.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't head west this time. After leaving Crane Cry Mountain, he traveled northwest, arriving half a month later at an immortal city called Li City.</p><p>Although Li City maintained a detached relationship with the Dao Court, it wasn't under its jurisdiction.  It was jointly established by the factions of Jushan Province, and its scale couldn't compare to Sermon City, much less Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>Nevertheless, this small city was widely known throughout Jushan Province.</p><p>Passing through Li City, and transferring through several other immortal cities, each equipped with a teleportation formation, until reaching Star Island Immortal Lake, was one of the safest and most convenient routes in Jushan Province.</p><p>Viewed from north to south, Jushan Province's terrain resembled a funnel.</p><p>The further north, the wider it became, gradually narrowing towards the south.  There was a reason why the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom chose the Yellow Springs Path for their military standoff.</p><p>When Qin Sang infiltrated the Ghostfang Kingdom, his round trip, including the time spent searching for the Dream Transforming Four Seasons Flower, took less than a year.</p><p>The distance in the north-south direction was much greater, and Star Island Immortal Lake was located at the northern end of Jushan Province.  Relying solely on flight would be too slow.</p><p>Li City was built on a plain, offering a wide view. Despite its small size, its defenses were quite tight.</p><p>The city gates were bustling with people. Many cultivators from Jushan Province, after leaving Li City, would first detour westward to Sermon City before heading to Crane Cry Mountain, finding that route much safer.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the city with the flow of people.  As far as the eye could see, over ninety percent of the cultivators wore Daoist robes and crane cloaks.</p><p>Beneath these Daoist garments, they might not necessarily practice Daoist lineages, but they were certainly influenced by Daoist Dharma.</p><p>Li City served as a waystation, offering little of interest, so Qin Sang headed directly for the teleportation formation.</p><p>Cloud Peak City.</p><p>This immortal city was situated between Li City and Star Island Immortal Lake.  Emerging from the teleportation formation in Cloud Peak City, Qin Sang didn't continue north.  After leaving the city, he recalled the geomantic map in his memory and flew eastward.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Sang spotted several north-south mountain ranges in the distance. Outside the mountains, a vast alluvial plain formed by river erosion was densely populated.</p><p>Within the mountains, there were several clusters of cultivator auras.</p><p>He didn't stop, continuing eastward, observing undulating mountains and numerous similar locations nestled among them.</p><p>These were the locations of the various sects' mountain gates.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang stopped before a graceful and verdant mountain range.</p><p>"Tao Heng Mountain."</p><p>This name flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>When he returned to Crane Cry Mountain from Star Valley, while gathering information about Jushan Province, the first person he befriended was the Sect Master of Tao Heng Mountain.</p><p>At the time of their acquaintance, the Tao Heng Mountain Sect Master's cultivation was at the mid-stage Nascent Soul realm, known in this world as the mid-stage Ascendant Profound Dharma Position, approaching the bottleneck of the late-stage Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>This world wasn't lacking in Deity Transformation experts.  For the sect master of a sect to only be at the mid-stage Nascent Soul realm seemed somewhat weak. Qin Sang suspected that Tao Heng Mountain likely had hidden experts.</p><p>Along his journey, Qin Sang discovered that there were many sects, both large and small, clustered around Tao Heng Mountain like stars surrounding the moon.</p><p>The reason for this was that Tao Heng Mountain possessed a Dharma Altar, qualifying it to bestow Dharma Lineages!</p><p>This altar was known as the Tao Heng Ancestral Altar, but it certainly wasn't established by Tao Heng Mountain.  As for which Daoist sect it originally belonged to, even Tao Heng Mountain might not know.</p><p>In Jushan Province, not every sect possessed a Dharma Altar. If they wished to receive a Dharma Lineage, they could only seek the assistance of a faction possessing one.</p><p>These factions gathered around Tao Heng Mountain for this very reason, holding their heads high, acting in some ways as vassals of Tao Heng Mountain.</p><p>Therefore, the structure of Jushan Province differed greatly from the Storm Realm.  In the Storm Realm, sects were built based on spiritual veins.  Here, sects prioritized Dharma Altars.</p><p>Without aligning themselves with a faction possessing a Dharma Altar, they could only use spirit stones and treasures to purchase the right for their disciples to receive a Dharma Lineage, or face the crisis of their lineage's extinction.</p><p>One could imagine the immense value of a Dharma Altar, inevitably attracting covetous eyes.  Insufficient strength wouldn't be enough to protect it.</p><p>"Who goes there?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't concealed his presence, and was immediately detected by the mountain guarding disciples who came to question him.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is Qing Feng, here to visit True Person Tao. This is my visiting card," Qin Sang introduced himself.</p><p>Learning that he was visiting their sect master, the guarding disciples dared not be negligent and quickly reported his arrival.  Soon, laughter echoed from within the mountain, and a Daoist in azure robes flew out. It was True Person Tao.  "A distinguished guest has arrived! Please forgive my tardiness in welcoming you!"</p><p>The two greeted each other warmly and entered the mountain.</p><p>After some pleasantries, True Person Tao inquired, "Fellow Daoist, on this journey, what important matters bring you? Perhaps this humble Daoist can be of assistance?"</p><p>"Couldn't I have come specifically to visit Fellow Daoist?" Qin Sang replied with a smile.</p><p>True Person Tao feigned displeasure, "I understand Fellow Daoist's temperament.  Thirty years ago, I extended an invitation, yet Fellow Daoist has made me wait for so long.  Your dedication to the Dao is unwavering, something I'm ashamed to compare myself to. If it weren't for some other pressing matter, I wouldn't let you leave your cave dwelling!"</p><p>"It wasn't that I was unwilling, but rather that circumstances prevented me."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly.  Back then, pressured by the impending heavenly tribulation, how could he be distracted?</p><p>True Person Tao didn't pry further, asking, "Fellow Daoist, by venturing out personally this time, are you planning to travel and select a Dharma Lineage for your disciple?"</p><p>"Indeed, which is why I came directly to your esteemed grounds," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>When he befriended True Person Tao, Qin Sang had pretended to be seeking a suitable Dharma Lineage for his disciple.</p><p>True Person Tao knowingly said, "I haven't forgotten our agreement from back then.  It remains valid today. As long as Fellow Daoist chooses our Tao Heng Ancestral Altar and becomes a Guest Elder of Tao Heng Mountain, your future descendants can all receive Dharma Lineages at the Tao Heng Ancestral Altar."</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "Back then, I hadn't made a decision and hadn't carefully inquired about your sect's Dharma Lineage…"</p><p>"These are not secrets."</p><p>True Person Tao thought for a moment, then said, "Fellow Daoist, come with me to the Bestowal Court, and you'll understand."</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  "Wouldn't that be too presumptuous?"</p><p>As its name suggested, the Bestowal Court was where the sect bestowed Dharma Lineages.  The Dharma Altar, the core of the sect, was located within the Bestowal Court, undoubtedly a forbidden area.</p><p>By now, True Person Tao had already risen and walked towards the door, saying it was no trouble at all.</p><p>True Person Tao was still unaware of Qin Sang's true cultivation level.</p><p>If Qin Sang deliberately concealed it, even cultivators of the same rank would find it difficult to see through, let alone him.</p><p>However, True Person Tao was very confident in the Bestowal Court's defenses.</p><p>The Bestowal Court was the most heavily guarded area of the sect. Even if a Cave Profound True Person infiltrated it, they wouldn't be able to gain any advantage.  Moreover, he wasn't taking Qin Sang to the Tao Heng Ancestral Altar itself.</p><p>Qin Sang understood this and wouldn't be foolish enough to cause trouble in a sect's forbidden area.</p><p>The Bestowal Court was located in a valley deep within Tao Heng Mountain. Looking down from above, one could see a few scattered pavilions and halls within the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard that the Bestowal Courts of Daoist sects typically had numerous halls for worshipping various deities, grand and solemn, unlike the simple structures of Tao Heng Mountain.</p><p>However, Tao Heng Mountain wasn't a direct lineage of the Daoist orthodoxy and didn't adhere to those customs.</p><p>True Person Tao landed with Qin Sang outside the valley and led him into a large hall where some scriptures were stored.</p><p>"The Tao Heng Ancestral Altar can bestow the first level of the Supreme Unity Childlike Lingguan General Dharma Lineage, contemplating the sixty Jiazi Tai Sui deities who are close to the water element, making it easy to invite Guardian Dharma Generals.  Ascending to receive the Inspecting Water Jade Dharma Lineage, contemplating the deities of the Water Ministry, based on experience, inviting the Golden Gate Bi Constellation Emissary as a Guardian Dharma General is the easiest…"  True Person Tao explained.</p><p>Had this been when Qin Sang first entered this world, he wouldn't have understood the meaning of True Person Tao's words at all.</p><p>Among Daoist sects, Dharma Lineages varied. Each sect's heritage encompassed several Dharma Lineages, arranged according to their rank, forming a complete system for the sect.</p><p>An entire system usually had a specific name, such as the Heavenly Hub Academy's Capital Merit Dharma Lineage, or the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy's Northern Emperor Dharma Lineage.</p><p>The Dharma Lineage of the Tao Heng Ancestral Altar was known by nearby cultivators as the Tao Heng Mountain Lineage.</p><p>As True Person Tao had stated, the Tao Heng Mountain Lineage only had two levels, because each level actually corresponded to two major realms.</p><p>Upon entering the Dao, one received the Supreme Unity Childlike Lingguan General Dharma Lineage, corresponding to the Orthodox Unity Dharma Position and the Moral Dharma Position.  There was no need to receive another Dharma Lineage in between, and cultivation could proceed normally.</p><p>This was equivalent to the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages.</p><p>Afterward, returning to the Ancestral Altar to ascend and receive the Inspecting Water Jade Dharma Lineage, one could continue cultivating to the Cave Spirit Dharma Position and the Ascendant Profound Dharma Position, which was the peak of the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>If anyone in Tao Heng Mountain managed to break through further, the Tao Heng Ancestral Altar couldn't bestow the corresponding Dharma Lineage, and they would have to seek it elsewhere.</p><p>The sixty Jiazi Tai Sui deities and the Golden Gate Bi Constellation Emissary were all deities from Daoist legends.</p><p>In Dharma Lineages, aligning with deities referred to these figures.  Successfully contemplating these deities allowed one to invite Guardian Dharma Generals.</p><p>When the previous sect established the Dharma Altar and passed down the Dharma Lineage, it might not have corresponded to these specific deities.  Perhaps due to different cultivation techniques or incomplete inheritance, the Tao Heng Mountain cultivators couldn't contemplate these deities.</p><p>However, it didn't matter. As long as they could contemplate similar deities and successfully invite Guardian Dharma Generals, they could cultivate.</p><p>The fact that the Tao Heng Mountain Lineage only had two levels confirmed True Person Zhijian's words.</p><p>If he wanted to seek higher Dharma Lineages, it would be very difficult!  Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, True Person Tao continued his enthusiastic introduction, "After Fellow Daoist's disciples receive the Dharma Lineage, if they establish a Golden Seal Altar, the most suitable spiritual material is Silver Dew Tree sap. Our sect cultivates many Silver Dew Spirit Trees and can allocate a certain share to Fellow Daoist.  At least your disciples won't have to worry before breaking through to the Cave Spirit Dharma Position."</p><p>He believed his offer was quite generous, but winning over a top-tier expert wasn't so easy.</p><p>True Person Tao looked at Qin Sang, awaiting a response.</p><p>"Silver Dew Tree sap…"  Qin Sang muttered to himself, recalling True Person Tao's introduction.</p><p>Based on the name of the Dharma Lineage and the deities to be contemplated, it was evident that the Tao Heng Mountain Lineage leaned towards the water element in the five elements.</p><p>In fact, every Dharma Lineage had different focuses, with distinctions based on the five elements, yin and yang, and so on, and were categorized accordingly.</p><p>Although all these Dharma Lineages allowed one to establish an altar and invite deities, cultivators ideally chose a Dharma Lineage that aligned with their own cultivation technique, as it was said to offer certain benefits.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's understanding of the "Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter," this cultivation technique could be considered formless, or at least compatible with all five elements.  Of course, Qin Sang didn't expect to gain many benefits.</p><p>If sword Dharma Lineages or killing Dharma Lineages existed in this world, those might be the most suitable for him.</p><p>Since that was the case, Qin Sang's primary consideration was the Dharma Lineage that allowed for the fastest altar establishment.</p><p>Cultivators outside the Daoist orthodoxy generally cultivated Golden Seal Altars.  Even among Daoist sects, only a minority could afford to maintain Daoist soldiers.</p><p>The spiritual materials required to establish a Golden Seal Altar needed properties that aligned with the Dharma Lineage, known as "altar stabilizers."  Otherwise, even if the altar was forcibly established, it would be prone to instability.</p><p>It could be seen that the essence of altar establishment was refining the special power within these spiritual materials and fusing it with the power of the Dharma Lineage.</p><p>Considering his own situation, Qin Sang had already contemplated this.  He believed the two most suitable Dharma Lineages for him were Fire Ministry Dharma Lineages and Thunder Ministry Dharma Lineages!</p><p>Not the Tao Heng Mountain Lineage, which was a Water Ministry Dharma Lineage.</p><p>He possessed Vermilion Bird True Feathers and Heavenly Phoenix True Feathers.  If he could use the true fire contained within these true feathers to establish an altar, wouldn't it be effortless to create a sturdy Dharma Altar?</p><p>As for the Thunder Ministry, he had once hunted a Thunder Turtle beast in the Storm Realm, obtaining its demonic bones and demonic core.</p><p>The demonic bones and core possessed the Thunder Turtle's innate thunder power. If refined, they should be able to establish a Dharma Altar at the Deity Transformation level.</p><p>He also had materials of even higher rank. Within the Phoenix Wings, the Azure Phoenix's origin thunder power was no less potent than the two types of true fire!</p><p>(A note about a new error correction feature has been added on the original platform.)</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
