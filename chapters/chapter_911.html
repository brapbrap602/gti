<h1>Chapter 903: The Stone Dais and the Scars</h1><p>Chapter 903: The Stone Dais and the Scars</p><p>The hall walls were mottled, with runes etched directly onto them. The strokes were powerful and elegant, bearing the marks of time.</p><p>The stone dais was older than the hall itself.</p><p>On the surface, it was just an ordinary crescent-shaped stone platform, yet it emanated a strange, ancient aura that moved the heart, clearly not of this world.</p><p>The dais was scarred and battered, whether from ancient warfare or its original state was unclear.  Its surface was covered in crisscrossing marks, so chaotic as to defy any discernible pattern.</p><p>In the hall, aside from the spirit array, the stone dais, and the pool of thunderous plasma, there was nothing else.</p><p>The dais, so unremarkable, yet floated in mid-air.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed that this wasn't the dais' own power, but rather the convergence of the spirit array's energy.  The dais' location was precisely the array's eye.</p><p>The reason the thunderous plasma in the pool was so docile was most likely due to the spirit array; the dais' function remained unclear.</p><p>The spirit array and the dais were certainly not created by the same person, nor even in the same era. The one who left the spirit array must have placed the dais there with a specific purpose.</p><p>The cloaked figure stared intently at the dais;  the Black Serpent Mountain Ancestor had specifically requested this object.</p><p>He cautiously entered the hall. Seeing no immediate danger, he swiftly moved to the edge of the plasma pool.</p><p>Even though the plasma pool showed no change, being so close to it made the cloaked figure's scalp tingle and his eyelids twitch. He acted with extreme caution.</p><p>“Could this be a strange treasure?”</p><p>Looking at the dais, the cloaked figure was perplexed.</p><p>From all appearances, it didn’t resemble a magical artifact; it showed no signs of possessing powerful inherent energy. Yet, the ancient, primordial aura it emitted was awe-inspiring. To have survived from ancient times to the present, it couldn’t be an ordinary object.</p><p>The situation outside was urgent, but the cloaked figure didn't seem concerned.</p><p>He didn't rush to take the dais. First, he took out a flying sword, activated his true essence, and gently struck the dais.</p><p>‘Ting!’</p><p>The sound was crisp.</p><p>The flying sword bounced off.</p><p>The cloaked figure then used a magical sword artifact, with the same result.  He struck several times, leaving no mark whatsoever.</p><p>The dais was exceptionally hard.</p><p>Those shockingly deep scars on its surface, unless they were original, could only have been inflicted by weapons far beyond ordinary swords.</p><p>The cloaked figure decisively put away his sword, placed his palm gently on the dais, and channeled his true essence into it.</p><p>The next moment, a faint glow suddenly appeared on the dais' surface. The hall was too bright to see it clearly, but it was a hazy, ethereal light, like faint starlight.</p><p>The dais finally showed a change, but the cloaked figure, already expecting it, showed no excitement. As he continued to pour in his spiritual energy, the starlight only intensified, with no other changes.</p><p>“As expected, even the two great Yuan Ying cultivators from the human race couldn't discern its nature, mistaking it for merely an array eye and an aid to cultivation. I shouldn't expect any breakthroughs using human methods.”</p><p>The cloaked figure withdrew his spiritual energy, pondered briefly, then moved his lips, uttering strange syllables.</p><p>Then, he extended his right hand, fingers spread wide. A strange tattoo, a type of Wu tribal rune, appeared on his arm. A ball of silver light gathered in his palm. With a low shout, he struck the dais with it.</p><p>It was a bolt of lightning.</p><p>After striking the dais, the lightning didn’t dissipate but transformed into a net of electricity, encasing the dais, as if attempting to penetrate it or activate a hidden power within.</p><p>Unfortunately, the cloaked figure still failed. The dais remained unchanged, only glowing faintly, and due to the weakness of the rune, the light was almost invisible.</p><p>But he wasn't discouraged, for Wu tribal runes encompassed a vast range of powers, including wind, rain, thunder, and lightning.</p><p>Wu tribal inheritance must have been a profound system of practice, at least equal to that of the human race, yet it was inexplicably severed so completely.</p><p>The cloaked figure activated different runes, manifesting various powers, even employing insect-gu, but received no response from the dais.</p><p>Finally, the cloaked figure was exhausted and had to give up.</p><p>“No wonder my master called it a strange treasure rather than a magical artifact. What secret lies within this object? It seems only my master, or another Wu tribal Yuan Ying cultivator, can unlock it.”</p><p>The cloaked figure muttered to himself, his demeanor changing. He retracted all the runes, recalling the dying words of the abandoned disciple from the Fighting Bull Peak. His true essence reappeared, splitting into several streams, and merging into the spirit array.</p><p>The runes in the array flickered. Seizing the opportunity, the cloaked figure reached out, snatched the dais with lightning speed, lifted it, and successfully removed it.</p><p>The cloaked figure's face lit up. He quickly put the stone platform into his pouch, but noticed something unusual in the thunder pool.</p><p>The normally calm thunder liquid showed subtle ripples on its surface.  Its aura became increasingly violent, and the surrounding ambient thunder was affected.</p><p>Clearly, the platform was crucial to the spirit array.  Removing it destabilized the array.  The runes in the array lit up brilliantly, but the agitation of the thunder liquid couldn't be stopped.</p><p>A full pool of thunder liquid, if it erupted, would destroy the entire island. Even this thin layer terrified the cloaked figure; he didn't dare delay.  He leaped back, swiftly exiting the hall.</p><p>Outside the Thunder Cave, the Foundation Establishment cultivators from various sects, alerted by the disturbance, rushed to the scene, only to discover a group of unfamiliar Witch Cultivators.  They immediately realized the three disciples from Dou Niu Peak were involved in a deception.</p><p>"Get out!"</p><p>The Witch Cultivators reformed their array. With a wave of the Beast King Banner, golden threads shot out, targeting the two fastest human Gold Core cultivators.  Sensing the power of the threads, the two cultivators' expressions changed drastically. They activated their treasures to defend, but to no avail. The golden threads swallowed their attacks and pressed on relentlessly.  The two were forced to retreat hastily, thoroughly routed in a single exchange.</p><p>Fortunately, reinforcements arrived.</p><p>"That's the Witch clan's renowned Beast King Banner array!" someone exclaimed, recognizing it and gasping in shock.  The banner is notoriously difficult and complex to forge; only top-tier Witch clans possess one.</p><p>"These Witch Cultivators are no ordinary bunch! The Beast King Banner isn't complete, so don't worry. Anyone who dares infiltrate the island, don't let them escape!"</p><p>The most powerful human cultivators made arrangements. Everyone quickly changed their formation and counterattacked.  While the human cultivators outnumbered the Witch Cultivators, the latter's reliance on the Beast King Banner meant the battle wouldn't last long.</p><p>Just as things were becoming critical, the cloaked figure emerged from the Thunder Cave.  Seeing the situation, he waved his arm.  "Got it!  Retreat!"</p><p>With that, the cloaked figure fled. The Witch Cultivators, overjoyed, used the Beast King Banner for cover and swiftly retreated towards their formation.</p>
