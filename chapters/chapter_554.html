<h1>Chapter 547: The Urging</h1><p>Due to the unique nature of the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Scripture*, aside from the Ebony Sword, Qin Sang could also nurture a natal magical treasure within his dantian, drawing upon the power of his Gold Core.</p><p>Thinking about his natal magical treasure, Qin Sang still hadn't decided which one to refine.</p><p>He currently only knew the refining methods for four magical treasures: the Yin Xuan Pagoda and Yin Thunder Pearl from the *Ancient Yin Sha Manual*, the Celestial Sound Conch from the *All Heavens Demonic Sound*, and the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings.</p><p>The first three required compatible cultivation techniques, which he didn't possess.  The techniques stored within Pagoda Peak were similar.</p><p>The Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings originally belonged to someone else and naturally couldn't serve as his natal treasure unless Qin Sang shattered the Yin Ring and refined a new one.</p><p>"I'll consult with the Patriarch after forming my Gold Core and ask him to help me choose..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>After forming his Gold Core, he would be granted an audience with the Nascent Soul Patriarch, Duke Dongyang.</p><p>Having joined the sect for nearly a century, he had seen most of Mount Shaohua's Gold Core cultivators, yet he had never met Duke Dongyang. In his mind, this Patriarch was an extremely mysterious figure.</p><p>The thought of meeting Duke Dongyang filled Qin Sang with anticipation.</p><p>Once a sect member reached the Gold Core stage, they could become Duke Dongyang's disciple, meaning he would have a Nascent Soul backer.</p><p>"I wonder if the Patriarch still remembers that insignificant person who sold himself for Foundation Establishment all those years ago?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his thoughts drifting to Fairy Chenyan.</p><p>So many years had passed, and he hadn't heard any news of Fairy Chenyan. Even Realmwalker Mawu seemed to have vanished without a trace.</p><p>Had she reached Nascent Soul?</p><p>Logically, after reaching Nascent Soul, one would hold a grand ceremony and invite fellow cultivators to witness it.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he quickly shook his head.</p><p>After that transaction, they had no further connection. Whether Fairy Chenyan had reached Nascent Soul or not was no longer his concern.</p><p>Unrequited affection would only bring misfortune.</p><p>Today was the day to visit the Earth Sinkhole. Qin Sang put away the jade slip, left his cave, and flew towards the Earth Sinkhole.</p><p>The Flying Night Fiend emerged from the abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang skillfully checked the state of its corpse core.</p><p>He had been back for almost two months, and the Flying Night Fiend's injuries had significantly improved. The small cracks on its corpse core had now healed.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded approvingly and instructed the Flying Night Fiend to sit and meditate while he continued to heal it.</p><p>...</p><p>Two hours later, Qin Sang returned to Mount Shaohua. Just as he was about to return to his cave for cultivation, he noticed someone standing in front of it: Gao Yang, Qi Yuan Shou's disciple.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang quickened his pace and landed in front of Gao Yang, smiling. "Junior Brother Gao, what brings you here? Has Senior Uncle Qi finally allowed you to descend the mountain?"</p><p>Qi Yuan Shou had been in secluded cultivation, and Gao Yang rarely left the mountain. They had only met once in the past two months.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang finished speaking, he noticed something amiss in Gao Yang's expression.</p><p>Thanks to those two top-grade magical artifacts, they had always had a good relationship.</p><p>Gao Yang had great trust in Qin Sang, always addressing him warmly as "Senior Brother." Now, however, his face was serious.</p><p>"Junior Brother Gao, what happened?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked gravely, wondering if something had happened to Qi Yuan Shou.</p><p>Gao Yang winked at Qin Sang, his expression unchanged, cleared his throat, and said loudly, "Senior Brother Qin, Master asked me to ask you why, after accepting the Skull Guard duty, you have yet to report, instead idling around the sect? Do you disregard Master Qi's orders, the sect rules, and the Skull Pass military orders? You are ordered to go to Skull Pass immediately; do not delay!"</p><p>After relaying Qi Yuan Shou's reprimand, Gao Yang's stern expression softened, and he quietly explained, "Please don't take offense, Senior Brother. Master just called me to fetch a spirit herb. I happened to mention that you had returned to the mountain. I don't know why Master flew into a rage and immediately ordered me to come and urge you to report to Skull Pass."</p><p>Qin Sang slapped his forehead, remembering the Skull Guard token Qi Yuan Shou had given him.</p><p>He had accepted the token, intending to use his Skull Guard identity to explore the ancient battlefield and seize the initiative as soon as the spirit tide ended.</p><p>Times had changed.</p><p>Now, he could form his Gold Core at any time, and Gold Core cultivators weren't bound by these rules. The Skull Guard token was no longer useful. He hadn't expected Qi Yuan Shou to reprimand him for this.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that the Skull Guard token was probably hard to come by.  The one he held seemed to represent a captain's status, a rare position within the Skull Guard.</p><p>Mount Shaohua didn't hold absolute power at Skull Pass.</p><p>The token determined who could enter the ancient battlefield first.  There must have been many vying for it, and Qi Yuan Shou likely owed someone a favor for obtaining it for him.</p><p>He, however, had been ungrateful, failing to show up for nearly two years.  It was understandable that Qi Yuan Shou, unable to explain himself to Skull Pass, was furious.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked, "Has Senior Uncle Qi left seclusion?"</p><p>"Master left a message and returned to seclusion," Gao Yang shook his head.</p><p>"Alright, Junior Brother, please report back to Senior Uncle Qi and tell him I understand my mistake and will go to Skull Pass immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, and he decided not to wait any longer.</p><p>After forming his Gold Core, he wouldn't need to rely on Qi Yuan Shou, but he couldn't burn bridges and offend someone for no reason, especially since Qi Yuan Shou had acted in his best interest.</p><p>He still needed to maintain appearances, to give Qi Yuan Shou and the sect an explanation.</p><p>The reason he had stayed was to wait for the Flying Night Fiend to recover.</p><p>Now that the Flying Night Fiend's injuries were improving, he could take enough Earth Sha Qi with him and continue the healing process at Skull Pass.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind, bid farewell to Gao Yang, and immediately searched every market, buying up all the lodestones. He then refined a large batch of Lesser Yin Magnetic Flasks, filled them with Earth Sha Qi, confident that the Iron Finger Ring could hold them.</p><p>He then retrieved the Flying Night Fiend and headed straight for the Supreme Yuan Serenity Palace.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Supreme Yuan Serenity Palace.</p><p>Arriving at the Supreme Yuan Serenity Palace once more, Qin Sang hadn't even entered the mountain gate when he encountered several Foundation Establishment cultivators, all headed to the ancient battlefield.</p><p>In the southeastern region of the Righteous Path territories in the Small Cold Realm, the Supreme Yuan Serenity Palace held the only ancient teleportation formation directly connected to the ancient battlefield.</p><p>Now that everyone knew the spirit tide in the ancient battlefield was nearing its end, those hoping for a stroke of luck were rushing to the ancient battlefield.</p><p>The Supreme Yuan Serenity Palace opened its doors wide, allowing anyone, regardless of status, to use the teleportation formation after paying a hefty sum of spirit stones once enough people were gathered.</p><p>Surrounding rogue cultivators, sects, and clan cultivators all had to abide by the Supreme Yuan Serenity Palace's rules.</p><p>Upon entering the mountain gate, they were immediately guided to temporary lodgings, told that the required number of people hadn't been reached yet, and to expect the teleportation formation to activate the following evening.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat of a celebrity.  Shortly after arriving, he was recognized.</p><p>They were all fellow cultivators who had once roamed the ancient battlefield.  Qin Sang accepted their invitation and spent the time discussing the Dao with them until noon the next day.</p><p>A message arrived, announcing the imminent activation of the teleportation formation.</p><p>Qin Sang excused himself, and flew towards the main hall.</p><p>Seeing the ancient teleportation formation for the second time, Qin Sang's understanding far surpassed his previous visit.  He carefully observed how the Supreme Yuan Serenity Palace elder activated the formation. Combining this with his recent insights, he gradually began to grasp some of its principles.</p><p>However, with so few ancient teleportation formations remaining in the world, Qin Sang lacked opportunities for practical application.</p>
