Chapter 538: Dove Robe Daoist's Legacy


However, before untying the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, Qin Sang needed to utilize the Corpse Pill's power to take care of a few things, lest the pill shatter and he lose the opportunity.


Qin Sang and Wandering Scholar agreed to meet at a location far from the Green Sun Demonic Sect after he finished his business.  To avoid disrupting the secret technique, Qin Sang allowed himself two extra days, so there was no rush.


He took out four items and placed them before him:


The Yin ring of the Concentric Rings of Harmony, two damaged Ten Yama Banners, and the iron thumb ring obtained from Dove Robe Daoist.


He picked up the Concentric Rings of Harmony and channeled his True Essence into it.


The white gold ring was riddled with cracks.  In the past, when Qin Sang probed it with his spiritual power, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no reaction from the ring.


This time was clearly different.


As soon as his True Essence entered, the Concentric Rings of Harmony emitted a faint white light, then, under Qin Sang's expectant gaze, it began to tremble slightly.


However, no matter how much True Essence Qin Sang poured in, the ring showed no further change.


After a while, Qin Sang gave up.


"It seems I must repair it and refine the Yang ring before I can use it. No wonder Old Man Di Que couldn't use it back then. I wonder when I'll be able to gather the Myriad Year Camphorwood and Heavenly Capital Rock."


Qin Sang shook his head, storing the Concentric Rings of Harmony back in his Mustard Seed Bag, then picked up the Ten Yama Banners.


Two Ten Yama Banners.


One was damaged by Fatty when he stole the Infernal Blood Mulberry in the Thunder Swallow's cave.


The other, from Dove Robe Daoist, was tainted by the Blood Defiled Divine Light, greatly diminishing its spiritual nature, and was later damaged in battle.


Neither banner was severely damaged. Qin Sang initially thought that nurturing them with the Corpse Pill for a while would restore them, but now he realized it wasn't that simple.


Half an hour later, Qin Sang withdrew his True Essence and carefully examined the two banners.


The cracks on the Yama Banners remained, showing no signs of recovery.


"How could this be…?"


The damaged areas on both banners were on the surface of the flags.


Qin Sang's fingers brushed against the banner's surface. The pale cloth hung down naturally, feeling as smooth as silk and emitting a chilling sensation. He studied it for a long time but couldn't determine the material.


Logically, this shouldn't be the case. Once a magical treasure is refined, it should be a cohesive whole. Nurturing it with Golden Core energy should be able to restore it.


Although Qin Sang's Corpse Pill was peculiar, it was no worse than that of other Core Formation cultivators. It shouldn't be the pill's fault.


Qin Sang was puzzled, muttering, "Could it be that I need to find spiritual materials of the same nature to repair the damage? That would be troublesome…"


He had no idea how the Ten Yama Banners were refined. Unless he found Grand Patriarch Kui Yin's refining method and the necessary spiritual materials, it would be impossible.


The Kui Yin Sect was destroyed, and the three Core Formation cultivators most likely to know the refining method were all deceased.


After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang put down the Ten Yama Banners and turned his attention to the iron thumb ring.


The dark iron ring was covered in rust, with no discernible fluctuations.  Thrown into a pile of scrap metal, no one would give it a second glance.


Only when held in hand did one realize how heavy the small ring actually was.


Qin Sang remembered his first attempt to open the ring. Inside seemed to be a space similar to a Mustard Seed Bag, likely a storage artifact used by Dove Robe Daoist.


The ring contained Dove Robe Daoist's restrictions. Qin Sang was previously unable to break them, but now he might be able to try.


There might be something he needed inside.


"I wonder what surprises await…"


Qin Sang's expression turned thoughtful.


The restrictions Dove Robe Daoist left on the ring were primarily based on divine sense. Since Qin Sang's divine sense hadn't improved, brute force was impossible. He needed a strategy, using True Essence to break the restrictions.


Fortunately, Dove Robe Daoist was dead, and the restrictions were masterless, making it less difficult.


Qin Sang grasped the iron ring and flashed out of the cave to an open area outside. He channeled a wisp of divine sense, probing the ring.


In the next instant, the ring flashed brightly, and an exceptionally sharp blade of energy shot towards Qin Sang like lightning.


Prepared, Qin Sang tapped his foot, leaving a trail of afterimages.


His strength was far greater now.  Without the Ebony Sword, he could easily dodge, leading the blade of energy on a wild goose chase.


Meanwhile, True Essence surged in Qin Sang's palm, probing the ring along with his divine sense. After several repetitions, he grasped the pattern of the restrictions.  Finally, he mobilized the Corpse Pill, focusing all his power, and finding the restriction's weak point, he finally broke it.


'Boom!'


Inside the iron ring, the restrictions shattered, revealing a space dozens of times larger than a Mustard Seed Bag to Qin Sang's 'eyes.'


Qin Sang cautiously extended a wisp of divine sense, finding nothing unusual.  Reassured, he began to examine the space.  To his disappointment, the ring seemed to be a simple storage artifact, no different from a Mustard Seed Bag except for its larger capacity.


However, it was more convenient and discreet to carry than a Mustard Seed Bag.


Worn on the finger, it also allowed for quicker access to stored items.


Clearly, Dove Robe Daoist had also used it as a storage artifact, as it was filled with various miscellaneous items.


Qin Sang returned to the cave and emptied the ring's contents.  To prevent encountering anything similar to the ring itself, he meticulously examined even the mundane objects.


Jade slips and books were numerous.


One jade slip contained a cultivation technique called the *Ancient Yin Sha Manual*, passed down by Grand Patriarch Kui Yin, the core technique of the Kui Yin Sect.


Qin Sang had previously obtained the first two parts of the *Ancient Yin Sha Manual* from Silver Flame and the others, corresponding to the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages.


Dove Robe Daoist's jade slip contained the complete *Ancient Yin Sha Manual*, with a total of four layers, allowing cultivation up to the late Nascent Soul stage.


Upon seeing the *Ancient Yin Sha Manual*, Qin Sang immediately focused on reading it.


The jade slip was densely covered with Dove Robe Daoist's annotations and insights.


The *Ancient Yin Sha Manual* was a demonic cultivation technique that utilized Yin Sha energy. It was no wonder the Kui Yin Sect was built on the Yin Sha Abyss. Cultivating this technique with sufficient Yin Sha energy would result in rapid progress.


However, because Yin Sha energy was an external force, it presented an additional obstacle when encountering major bottlenecks, making breakthroughs more difficult than for cultivators of orthodox techniques.


Upon reading this, Qin Sang immediately dismissed the *Ancient Yin Sha Manual*. Even without the *Nurturing the Soul with the Sword*, he wouldn't cultivate this technique.


As for the accompanying divine abilities and spells, they mostly required Yin Sha energy, leaving Qin Sang with few options, none of which were particularly useful.


Qin Sang quickly skimmed the first two layers, finding the description of the destined magical treasure for the *Ancient Yin Sha Manual* in the third layer.


Surprisingly, the technique offered two compatible magical treasures: the Yin Xuan Pagoda and the Yin Thunder Pearl.


Naturally, each cultivator could only choose one.


Neither of them was a banner.
