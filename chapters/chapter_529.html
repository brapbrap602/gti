<h1>Chapter 522: The Violent Collision of Qi</h1><p>Chapter 522: The Violent Collision of Qi</p><p>Hearing Shi Ying's words, Qin Sang couldn't help but laugh and cry, but quickly dismissed all distractions, shutting out his five senses and focusing his mind on his dantian, not daring to be distracted in the slightest.  Shi Ying was extremely nervous, and so was he. Shi Ying couldn't offer much help; it all depended on Qin Sang himself. What he was about to attempt was a forceful breakthrough of his own dantian. If an accident occurred, Shi Ying might at most be injured, but Qin Sang could have his dantian foundation destroyed, and his survival was far from certain.</p><p>In the quiet cave, green demonic flames flickered.  The sliver of Green Sun Divine Qi, severed earlier, drifted towards Qin Sang's dantian.</p><p>At that moment, a vortex suddenly appeared in Qin Sang's dantian, within which spiritual energy and earth-sha Qi mingled, creating a grayish swirl.</p><p>At this point, Shi Ying paused slightly.  She first checked the Green Sun Divine Qi, confirming it showed no signs of collapse. Then she looked at Qin Sang, confirming the corpse puppet remained obedient.</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Shi Ying gently bit her red lip, steeled her heart, and abruptly pushed the Green Sun Divine Qi into the vortex!</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang made his first real contact with the Green Sun Divine Qi.  To his surprise, this legendary supremely yang Qi, one of the world's rare treasures, paired with the earth-sha Qi, was surprisingly gentle and peaceful, like a drop of exquisitely refined nectar falling into Qin Sang's dantian, soft and delicate as congealed fat.</p><p>Was this its inherent nature, or was this appearance due to its transformation into Divine Qi essence?</p><p>Qin Sang's question didn't last long. After the Green Sun Divine Qi entered the vortex, Shi Ying immediately withdrew the Green Sun Demonic Flame encasing it. In an instant, freed from its confinement, the Green Sun Divine Qi revealed its true nature!</p><p>The previously gentle Green Sun Divine Qi suddenly sprang into action. Before Qin Sang and Shi Ying could react, it fiercely pierced Qin Sang's dantian. It wasn't just a simple streak of green light; it was a bolt of green lightning, carrying an extremely violent energy, revealing its predatory fangs!</p><p>The sudden change caused Shi Ying's face to change drastically. Although she cultivated the Green Sun Demonic Flame, she didn't fully understand the Green Sun Divine Qi. Disciples like them simply followed the cultivation methods, practicing step by step.  To delve into the essence of Green Sun Divine Qi, they'd likely have to wait until after forming their Golden Core.</p><p>The Green Sun Divine Qi's erratic behavior was unexpected to Shi Ying.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart also tightened. Such a minuscule amount of Green Sun Divine Qi could erupt with such terrifying power; he felt a moment of dread, as if his dantian was about to be pierced, instinctively wanting to expel the Green Sun Divine Qi with all his might.</p><p>But he quickly suppressed this instinct, focusing his mind on his dantian.  Even if the Green Sun Divine Qi was powerful, the quantity was too small. Shi Ying had brought out only a little from the mountain, and this was only part of it.  Half of his dantian was filled with earth-sha Qi. It wouldn't be defeated by the Green Sun Divine Qi.</p><p>As long as he stabilized the earth-sha Qi, he could regain control.</p><p>"Why did the Green Sun Divine Qi suddenly erupt?" Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>The fluctuations from Shi Ying's soul imprint told Qin Sang that she was also shocked by the change, indicating that this change in the Green Sun Divine Qi was abnormal.</p><p>And so it was. Back on Divine Qi Peak, Shi Ying had repeatedly failed to seal the Green Sun Divine Qi, only resulting in silent dissipation.  This kind of change had never happened before.</p><p>"There's only one reason: it sensed the earth-sha Qi within me…"</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts raced, arriving at the cause.  Earth-sha Qi and Heaven-Opening Divine Qi, yin and yang, existed in harmony for eons, and their clash and opposition upon meeting wasn't strange.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang conceived a solution.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang could act, his dantian also lost control along with the Green Sun Divine Qi. The earth-sha Qi surged, creating a huge wave, rushing towards the Green Sun Divine Qi.</p><p>So it was! This scene confirmed Qin Sang's guess, but he felt no excitement; his mind was tense, his nerves stretched to their limit, as he desperately restrained the earth-sha Qi.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's quick reaction, he was a step too slow. It was too late.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>In an instant, a supremely yin earth-sha Qi and a supremely yang Divine Qi, two incredibly violent treasures of the world, collided violently.</p><p>The dantian was turbulent. The barrier formed by the five Yin objects vibrated incessantly under the impact of the explosion, helping to stabilize the dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was in his throat, his gaze fixed on his Golden Core.  His dantian fluctuated, the Golden Core suspended in the center, like a moon in water, flickering uncertainly amidst the turmoil.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang relaxed slightly.</p><p>Fortunately, the number of Qingyang Divine Gang was small.  Facing so much Earthly煞 energy, they were easily annihilated without resistance. The conflict quickly subsided, the impact was acceptable, and it didn't shake Qin Sang's foundation.</p><p>His Golden Core was barely affected and remained stable.</p><p>With the Qingyang Divine Gang destroyed, the Earthly煞 energy finally calmed down. Qin Sang's dantian gradually returned to peace. Outwardly, it seemed nothing had happened.</p><p>Outside, Shi Ying’s face turned pale. She was stunned for a moment. Seeing Qin Sang still sitting quietly, she suddenly came to her senses and nervously checked his condition.</p><p>Confirming Qin Sang was unharmed, Shi Ying breathed a sigh of relief, only then realizing her back was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>The conflict was very short and confined to Qin Sang's dantian, but the power displayed in that instant was terrifying. Recalling the scene, she was still frightened.</p><p>Thankfully, she had been cautious and tested with only a portion of the Qingyang Divine Gang first.</p><p>Shi Ying secretly rejoiced, her gaze falling on Qin Sang's dantian. After hesitating, she decided to continue testing.</p><p>The scene, though seemingly dangerous, perfectly matched the secret technique's description. Using the power of the煞 corpse itself to handle unexpected situations put Shi Ying's mind at ease.</p><p>She 'ordered' Qin Sang to recover and took a spirit pill herself, holding a spirit stone and quickly recovering her breath.</p><p>She was now wealthy, but before obtaining the legacy of the Foundation Establishment cultivator, she wouldn't dare to be so extravagant.</p><p>Soon, Shi Ying restored herself to peak condition. Seeing Qin Sang hadn't finished, she sat on the ground, propping her chin, waiting and staring blankly at him, talking to herself.</p><p>"Brother Corpse, when you recover, we'll try again, striving to complete your transformation as soon as possible…</p><p>Before I met you, I had already given up hope, forever unable to avenge my parents. You gave me hope…</p><p>I don't seek immortality or the Dao. I live only for revenge.</p><p>Don't worry, after revenge, I will keep my promise and find a way to unseal your soul…"</p><p>Shi Ying had never dared to share these innermost thoughts with anyone, suppressing them for too long.  Thinking Qin Sang was inanimate, she treated him as a confidant.</p><p>Unknowingly, she poured out her heart.</p><p>In Qing Mengmeng's cave, her eyes shone brightly, filled with fervent hope and a desperate resolve.</p>
