<h1>Chapter 1207: Awakening</h1><p>He drifted through the shadowy clouds.</p><p>He discovered that each cluster of dark clouds was filled with ancient, perilous seals, likely concealing similar sealed realms within.</p><p>However, those seals and restrictions were intact. If Qin Sang were to forcefully break in, it would consume a great deal of time and energy, and there was no guarantee of success. Moreover, it would provoke a counterattack from the seals, risking exposure.</p><p>Unless the Spirit of the Slaughter Sword sensed fragments, Qin Sang would not act recklessly.</p><p>Even so, navigating through the endless expanse of shadowy clouds and finding a path was no easy task. He had no idea how many wrong turns he had taken, going back and forth, circling aimlessly.</p><p>A full day had passed, and Qin Sang had only managed to explore a small nearby area.</p><p>The area wasn’t large, but it had taken an enormous amount of time. If it were just Qin Sang alone, he would have been utterly exhausted by now.</p><p>The Spirit of the Slaughter Sword remained unresponsive.</p><p>Qin Sang took a moment to regulate his breathing and then set off again.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang began to discern some patterns.</p><p>The route he chose resembled an arc, centered around the Palace of Sinful Gods. He avoided getting too close to the palace, instead exploring as much of the surrounding area as possible. If he found nothing in these outer regions, he would consider venturing closer to the Palace of Sinful Gods as a last resort.</p><p>Several days passed, and as time went on, Qin Sang and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly became more adept, speeding up their exploration.</p><p>Qin Sang came to a halt, gazing at the terrifying scene ahead—a chaotic sea of clouds.</p><p>Ancient seals coiled within the shadowy clouds, leaving no gaps.</p><p>This chaotic sea of clouds was not unique to the Abyss of Sin; there were several such places within the abyss.</p><p>It was certain that even the cultivators of the Abyss of Sin would find it difficult to enter such a place. Standing here, Qin Sang felt an overwhelming sense of danger. He dared only to approach slightly, allowing the sword spirit to sense on its own.</p><p>Reason told Qin Sang that it was best not to venture in, as he might not even be able to protect himself, let alone retrieve any treasures. Fortunately, the Spirit of the Slaughter Sword remained silent.</p><p>Over the past few days, Qin Sang had explored most of the accessible areas and found no trace of others. After the tremors in the Palace of Sinful Gods, only Nascent Soul Ancestors dared to linger in the Abyss Ruins. With the Abyss of Sin embroiled in constant warfare, it was no wonder this place was so desolate.</p><p>Several days passed with no results.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to persist and search the remaining areas, but he already had a premonition: "The likelihood of the Abyss Ruins containing fragments of the Slaughter Sword is slim. I’ll have to find a way to enter the Palace of Sinful Gods in the future..."</p><p>This thought flashed through his mind, and then his expression shifted slightly. He suddenly looked down at his waist, sensing something unusual in his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>"The Fire Jade Centipede has hatched here and awakened..."</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A streak of crimson fire flew out of the spirit beast pouch. Within the fiery glow was a centipede that seemed carved from red jade—the newly emerged Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Each of its legs was wreathed in crimson flames, as if it were riding the fire to fly. The surrounding fiery glow was formed by the power of the flames.</p><p>After its transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede had grown to the length of Qin Sang's arm, its claws bared, now a true beast.</p><p>Having slept for so long, it had finally awakened, transformed, and advanced. Qin Sang could feel the Fire Jade Centipede's excitement.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede fluttered around Qin Sang, seeking recognition from its master. After the soul imprint was planted, it had fully accepted Qin Sang, and there was no barrier between them.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly perched on his shoulder grew displeased. Its wings flashed, and a bolt of lightning shot out, easily dispersing the fiery glow around the Fire Jade Centipede, teaching it a lesson.</p><p>It wanted to make clear who the number one spirit insect under their master was!</p><p>With an entire major realm of difference, the Fire Jade Centipede was no match for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Fortunately, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly held back. The Fire Jade Centipede, stung by the pain, immediately reverted to its original size and scurried to the other side of Qin Sang, curling into a ball and trembling, its arrogance completely deflated.</p><p>Sensing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's smugness, Qin Sang was both amused and exasperated. His butterfly, despite not yet fully developing its intelligence, had already learned to be proud and vie for favor.</p><p>He couldn't bring himself to scold the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, so the Fire Jade Centipede would have to endure.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, looking at the Fire Jade Centipede with pity.</p><p>At this moment, he noticed that the Fire Jade Centipede's excitement seemed abnormal. "Hmm? Could the Fire Jade Centipede have sensed something, waking up due to an attraction? But it had been asleep for so long and was already close to waking up. Since its transformation was successful, waking up a bit early shouldn't cause any major issues..."</p><p>Qin Sang extended his hand, and the Fire Jade Centipede landed on his palm, cautiously unfurling its body. The emotions it conveyed were first of grievance, then of urgent urging for its master.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the direction the Fire Jade Centipede was indicating.</p><p>He remembered how the Fire Jade Centipede had once helped him find Crimson Fire Flowing Gold, which had been a great help later on. Now, the Fire Jade Centipede's excitement surpassed even that time, suggesting there might be something truly extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang trusted the Fire Jade Centipede's treasure-hunting abilities, but the direction it indicated gave him pause—it was pointing toward the Palace of Sinful Gods!</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang decided to take a look.</p><p>Waves of tremors continued to assault him, and Qin Sang could only do his best to conceal his sword light, pressing forward against the impact as he approached the Palace of Sinful Gods.</p><p>The further he went, the more impatient the Fire Jade Centipede became. Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression changed, and he came to an abrupt halt. The Fire Jade Centipede raised its upper body, puzzled as to why its master wasn't hurrying to retrieve the treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed as he stared ahead.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly could only see the storm caused by the tremors of the Palace of Sinful Gods, its vision filled with chaos. But Qin Sang's keen senses detected an unusual fluctuation within the chaos.</p><p>"Is someone fighting up ahead?"</p><p>Then, Qin Sang spread out his divine sense, focusing intently to confirm his guess.</p><p>He glanced at the Fire Jade Centipede coiled in his hand. The treasure wasn't hidden in some secret realm—it had already been discovered, and the commotion was likely due to a struggle over it.</p><p>This was deep within the Abyss Ruins, so it was undoubtedly an internal conflict among the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, weighing whether it was worth the risk.</p><p>If he revealed himself to seize the treasure, he would undoubtedly become the target of all, facing a joint attack. But as long as the opponents weren't mid-stage Nascent Soul experts, Qin Sang was confident he could shake them off and then leave the Abyss Ruins unnoticed through the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters.</p><p>Even if the Abyss of Sin sent people to block the entrance, it would be futile.</p><p>Having found the Bone Curse and searched most of the Abyss Ruins, Qin Sang was fairly certain that the fragments of the spirit sword weren't here. His purpose in coming to the Abyss of Sin was nearly fulfilled, and it was time to leave.</p><p>Before departing, if there was a chance to cause chaos in the Abyss Ruins and snatch a treasure, Qin Sang decided to go for it.</p><p>They were already enemies. He had already killed a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Abyss of Sin, so he wasn't afraid of offending a few more.</p><p>Of course, this was contingent on the opponents' strength being within his limits.</p><p>Qin Sang became even more cautious.</p><p>He summoned the Twelve Demon Banners, hiding them within his sleeves, and slowly approached the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>After flying for a while, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly finally caught sight of the distant battlefield.</p><p>But the scene before Qin Sang was utterly unexpected.</p><p>He saw a familiar figure—half-human, half-snake. It was the Serpent King!</p><p>He knew that the Serpent King and others would also come to the Abyss of Sin in search of treasures, which was why he had decided to set out early. But he hadn't expected to encounter the Serpent King in the Abyss Ruins. The ancient demon's cave was actually within the Abyss Ruins—he had no idea how they had managed to get in.</p><p>―</p><p>―</p><p>I can finish a chapter by noon, but without time for revisions or proofreading, it's better to wait until evening when all the chapters are done before posting.</p>
