<h1>Chapter 1948: The Forbidden Book</h1><p>“Senior Shi! You’ve come!”</p><p>Yu Lang’s alert expression softened. He bowed, remembering the events of a month ago, secretly thinking the other party had come to repay the medicinal debt.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi said gently, “You once saved me.  Don’t be so formal. You can call me Brother Shi.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yu Lang scratched his head.</p><p>Although this young man surnamed Shi always appeared quite disheveled, his cultivation was undoubtedly far superior to his own.</p><p>Yu Lang wasn’t good at polite conversation, so he simply replied, “Brother Shi, are your injuries healed?”</p><p>“My master is truly a master alchemist.  After taking a dose of Jade Luo Powder, the harmful mercury energy was immediately dispelled.  I've spent a month recuperating, and my injuries are fully under control.  I only need some time to fully recover.”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi spoke with unconcealed admiration.</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Lang couldn't help but smile, happy for the other and proud of his master’s medical skills.</p><p>The sound of training exercises drifted from outside the bamboo forest.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi turned his head, looking towards the bamboo forest, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.  “Cultivators specifically coming down the mountain to study and practice martial arts amongst mortals… this is the first time I've seen this. Is this your master's idea?”</p><p>Cultivation certainly involves literacy.</p><p>However, after cultivation, one's energy is abundant, one's mind sharp, and one possesses near-perfect memory. Studying with ordinary people at the same pace would inevitably be a drag and a waste of time.</p><p>“I wanted to come down the mountain to study, and Master agreed,” Yu Lang waved the spear in his hand. “Brother Shi, do you also know spear techniques?”</p><p>“In my youth, I admired the carefree and unrestrained style of martial heroes. However, in the mortal realm, the Divine Dao keeps watch, preventing the reckless use of spells. So I secretly learned martial arts, suppressing my cultivation, and went out to act as a righteous hero.”</p><p>As the young man surnamed Shi spoke of the past, a touch of sadness tinged his reminiscence. He suddenly chuckled, “The sword is a gentleman's weapon.  Wandering the world, it looks much more elegant than a spear or staff. However, I have encountered some skilled spear users. Your spear technique already surpasses most people, but this style is meant for fierce, killing attacks.  You lack real combat experience, that decisive and ruthless intent.”</p><p>Yu Lang greatly admired Brother Shi’s experiences. “When I was young, I only learned some basic skills from my father.  Now, I just practice casually. The spear technique is the military formation style taught by my teacher. I don’t even know how to cultivate true energy.  I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to travel down the mountain and see some advanced martial arts in the world.”</p><p>“You really want to continue practicing martial arts?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi looked at Yu Lang in surprise.  “Aren't you afraid of being scolded by your master for neglecting your studies?”</p><p>The methods of cultivators are incomparable to mortal martial artists. How could anyone abandon the essential for the secondary!</p><p>Seeing Yu Lang’s stiff expression, the young man surnamed Shi changed his tone, saying, “Martial arts aren't completely useless.  During my Qi Condensation stage, I often fell into danger. Several times, I survived only thanks to the agility and quick reflexes gained from martial arts.  I used surprise attacks to kill my opponents. Otherwise, you wouldn't see me today.”</p><p>Here, the young man surnamed Shi paused.</p><p>He could only say so much. In battles between Foundation Establishment cultivators, martial arts have very limited effectiveness.</p><p>Yu Lang took a deep breath.  “Brother Shi, you don’t need to say any more. I understand.  Practicing martial arts is only to fulfill a childhood wish. Cultivation is the most important thing. I won't sacrifice the greater for the lesser!”</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi nodded lightly, then suddenly smiled.  “In my younger days, I devoted considerable effort to creating a sword technique that I considered to be as refined as any other martial art.  Later, I dedicated myself to cultivation and never found a successor. Since you are interested in martial arts, and you call me big brother, I’ll pass this sword technique on to you. Consider it a continuation of the style. What do you say?”</p><p>Yu Lang was initially delighted, then hesitant.</p><p>Was he about to take a third teacher?</p><p>Mr. Chen's school was open to all.  He wasn't the only one studying there.</p><p>But martial arts were different, passed down secretly.  The rules of the martial world dictate that the relationship between master and student is like that of father and son.</p><p>Moreover, this Brother Shi was no ordinary mortal. Taking him as a teacher wouldn’t just be a one-time connection; there would be countless karmic entanglements in the future.</p><p>Would his master agree?</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi saw through Yu Lang’s thoughts and said casually, “It’s just a martial art.  For us cultivators, it's useless. Even if I passed on ten or more styles, it wouldn’t matter.  Don’t take it too seriously. I saw you liked it, so I'll give it to you as a gift, that's all.”</p><p>“Then I’ll gratefully accept. Thank you, Brother Shi!”</p><p>Yu Lang put aside his worries and immediately bowed deeply.</p><p>A young man, whose surname is Shi, waved his hand, separating the bamboo grove.  A sword, seemingly materializing from a pouch, appeared in his grasp. He brandished it, practicing the strokes.</p><p>“This martial art is called the ‘君者杀剑诀’ (Gentleman's Killing Sword Technique)! It has twenty-five forms and five essential principles.  It's designed to kill evildoers, but its style is upright and honorable; I always fight head-on.  I earned the reputation of ‘Gentleman Sword’ in the martial arts world.  I originally planned to integrate all the forms and principles for a breakthrough in the technique.  Unfortunately, circumstances changed, and I lost interest, letting it fall by the wayside.  If you're interested, you can try; perhaps you can discover something new.”</p><p>“The first form: ‘White Clouds Emerging from the Mountain Peaks!’”</p><p>As Shi explained, he became a blur of sword light.</p><p>A sharp wind whistled, bamboo leaves fluttering down.  His swordsmanship was exquisitely precise, far surpassing the spear techniques taught by Master Chen.</p><p>Yu Lang watched with wide eyes, listening intently, afraid of missing a single detail.</p><p>Soon, Shi finished demonstrating the ‘Gentleman's Killing Sword Technique,’ and sheathed his sword.</p><p>“Did you learn it?”</p><p>Yu Lang closed his eyes, thought for a moment, and nodded slightly.</p><p>“Before learning this sword technique, there are several other martial arts you need to master first. I developed this sword technique based on them. The first is the ‘Nameless River God’s Blade’!”</p><p>Shi used his sword like a blade, demonstrating a knife technique.</p><p>He demonstrated several more martial arts, one after another.  Yu Lang remembered each perfectly after a single demonstration.</p><p>“A truly remarkable talent.  Unfortunately, martial arts are not the ultimate path,” Shi sighed, shaking his head, and tossing his sword to Yu Lang.  “You lack a proper sword; take this. It’s considered a divine weapon in the mortal world, though it's merely a substandard magical artifact.”</p><p>Sensing the sword, Yu Lang accepted it without hesitation.</p><p>Suddenly realizing the time, he saw it was almost the end of the school day.  He cried out in alarm and rushed back to the school.</p><p>Shi waited until Yu Lang and Xiao Wu finished school, then walked back to the temple with them.  Along the way, he continued to explain various martial arts, interweaving his adventures, captivating Yu Lang and even holding Xiao Wu's attention.</p><p>Back at the temple, Shi waited until the last patient left, then paid his outstanding debt in spirit stones.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang pick up her pen and erase the account under the dim lamplight, just like any ordinary Daoist priest, Shi sighed, “I’ve only been to Qingyang Temple twice, but I don't know why, each time I enter, I feel an unprecedented sense of peace.  It truly is a place of tranquility; I almost don't want to leave.”</p><p>Despite his words, he soon took his leave, Yu Lang escorting him out.</p><p>…</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the three had spent four years at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The temple remained unchanged. Fewer people came seeking medicine, but those who did traveled from increasingly distant places.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang and Master Chen had held back Xiao Wu and Yu Lang for three years so they could finish their elementary studies with their peers.  Normally, they would now take the童试 (children's examination), after which they would become童生 (child students) and could attend the county school or other academies.</p><p>However, Master Chen's school was also considered an academy.  Though only a 秀才 (successful candidate in the first imperial examination), he was renowned for his talent.  Many fellow 秀才 admired him, often staying at the school to discuss classics, compose poetry, and implicitly treating him as their teacher.</p><p>Some童生 only registered at the county school and continued studying at Master Chen's academy.  Those who failed the examination, or those like Yu Lang and Xiao Wu who did not take it, were, after evaluation by Master Chen, also included with the童生 to study more advanced texts.</p><p>In fact, Xiao Wu and Yu Lang had already mastered those texts.  Master Chen often provided them with extra tutoring, even using his connections to obtain books from the prefecture and provincial capitals, especially having high hopes for Yu Lang.</p><p>Despite countless attempts to persuade him otherwise, Yu Lang remained steadfast, and Master Chen eventually gave up but continued to treat them well.</p><p>Yu Lang had a fulfilling few years.  After teaching Yu Lang the Gentleman's Killing Sword Technique, Shi visited Qingyang Temple every year or so.  Not to seek medicine.  Each visit, he brought various mortal martial arts as gifts for Yu Lang.  Even he wasn't sure whether he was repaying his young friend or seeking that precious tranquility.  He couldn't stay long, however, never more than an hour, coming and going quickly.</p><p>The snow had just cleared.</p><p>Yu Lang sat attentively, his expression shifting slightly as he glanced at his senior sister.  They exchanged a knowing smile, and at break time, they slipped off together towards the bamboo grove.</p><p>"Shi Da Ge!"</p><p>Spotting a young man surnamed Shi seated in the bamboo grove, Yu Lang exclaimed, a mix of excitement and complaint coloring his voice, "Why did it take you so long this time?"</p><p>"This brother can't disturb you too often,"</p><p>the young man surnamed Shi chuckled, offering no further explanation. He sized Yu Lang up and down, a hint of admiration in his voice, "You've reached the eleventh level of Qi Refinement so quickly!  Having a master really helps!  When are you planning to attempt Foundation Establishment?  Has your master given you any Foundation Establishment pills?"</p><p>"Master hasn't said anything," Yu Lang replied, a touch of frustration in his tone.</p><p>After reaching the tenth level of Qi Refinement, his master had offered him little guidance, and the medicinal baths had stopped. He wasn't sure what he should be doing next.</p><p>"With your master's abilities, refining a few Foundation Establishment pills would be a breeze.  He probably wants you to hone your skills. You're still young; you have plenty of time," the young man surnamed Shi said, waving his hand to conjure a wooden table which instantly became laden with cups and dishes.  He always brought a variety of delicacies, knowing Xiao Wu’s preferences.</p><p>"What are you looking at? Eat up!"</p><p>Seeing Xiao Wu happily devouring the food, while Yu Lang remained motionless, staring intently, the young man surnamed Shi shook his head with a smile, and tossed a stack of manuals over to him.  "Here you go!"</p><p>"Thank you, Shi Da Ge!"</p><p>Yu Lang cheered, hugging the manuals to his chest. He disregarded decorum, sitting on the ground and eagerly flipping through them.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng lets this kid indulge in martial arts; I wonder what his intentions are,"</p><p>the young man surnamed Shi mused to himself. He knew that his visits couldn't possibly escape his master's notice.  Since even the master wasn't objecting, he saw no need to say anything.  He glanced at Xiao Wu, who was eating slowly but steadily, and thought to himself, *That’s an odd one, too*.</p><p>Years passed, and Xiao Wu showed no signs of growth. He only used illusions to deceive ordinary people; he probably wasn't human.  Yet, the young man surnamed Shi couldn't determine Xiao Wu's true nature.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>all three stopped their activities and looked towards the outside.</p><p>Qiqia Village and Qinggui Town were connected by a road that had a three-way intersection, with another road leading to the county seat.  A group of people on horseback had just arrived from the county seat.</p><p>The group was led by several constables, followed by a contingent of armored soldiers; their horses thundered along.  The Southern Shu state border was constantly at war, with troops stationed there year-round, so this sight wasn't uncommon.</p><p>Xiao Wu and the young man surnamed Shi had already sensed their approach and hadn't paid much attention.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the soldiers didn't take the main road to Qinggui Town; instead, they turned onto a smaller road leading towards Qiqia Village.</p><p>"What are they doing?"</p><p>Yu Lang, who was the last to notice, frowned. The soldiers' killing intent was palpable; their intentions were clearly hostile.</p><p>*Nnnnnnn…*</p><p>The urgent sound of galloping hooves shattered the peace of Qiqia Village.</p><p>The soldiers burst through the bamboo grove, heading straight for the school. The leading constable, appearing to be only about twenty years old, yanked hard on the reins, causing his horse’s forelegs to rise high in the air, accompanied by a long neigh.  The soldiers behind him halted in unison.</p><p>Uproar erupted within the school; the students rushed out, staring in terror at the fierce-looking constables.  Some of the younger students burst into tears. Someone raced to the back hall to inform Mr. Chen.</p><p>The young constable let out a cold laugh and waved his hand. "Surround the building! Don't let anyone escape, or you'll be held accountable!"</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>The soldiers responded in unison, dividing into two lines and completely encircling the school.</p><p>Just as they were about to storm the school, Mr. Chen finally hurried out from the back hall.  Upon seeing the young constable, Mr. Chen's face darkened, and he shouted angrily, "Yue Duanshu!  Don't you dare act so brazenly! What do you think you're doing?!"</p><p>Yue Duanshu’s smile grew even colder as he raised his official badge high. "The magistrate's office received a confidential report that student Chen Zhenqing is using teaching as a cover to secretly distribute books banned by the court, with ulterior motives!  I've been ordered by the magistrate to investigate. Search the place! Anyone who dares to obstruct, will be killed without mercy!"</p><p>Yue Duanshu held up his badge, appearing righteous and superior.</p><p>"Who dares to slander me!"</p><p>Mr. Chen’s face was as dark as the bottom of a pot.</p><p>The students were filled with righteous indignation.</p><p>No one noticed a girl hiding behind the other students by the school window; her eyes widened in terror, and she almost collapsed. She shrank back, her demeanor frantic, fearful of making any sound.  Her hands trembled as she furtively pulled a damaged old book from her satchel.  Her whole body shook with fear, and the book nearly slipped from her grasp.</p><p>The soldiers’ footsteps sounded like a death knell.</p><p>The girl was at her wit's end, her eyes catching sight of a small, exquisite wooden box nearby.  She quickly stuffed the book inside. (End)</p>
