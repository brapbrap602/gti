<h1>Chapter 514: Changes</h1><p>Chapter 514: Changes</p><p>The first wisp of earth-bound煞 energy successfully entered the qi sea, marking a crucial step in completing the corpse refinement prohibition.</p><p>With Qin Sang's previous experience in corpse refinement and his powerful self-control, everything went smoothly.</p><p>But he dared not relax, for the difficulties lay ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently guided wisp after wisp of earth-bound煞 energy into his body, gradually completing the corpse refinement prohibition.</p><p>As the prohibition improved, his physical changes were minimal, but the sensations he received became clearer—the gradual chilling of his blood, the craving for bloodshed…</p><p>None of this could shake him.</p><p>The jade Buddha allowed him to remain calm, completely unaffected by desire.</p><p>Only the intense pain emanating from his dantian could make even Qin Sang's strong willpower falter. He could only grit his teeth and persevere, taking a healing pill to alleviate the pain every so often.</p><p>Fortunately, thanks to Wu Shang's notes, Qin Sang was well-prepared and able to endure.</p><p>Another wisp of earth-bound煞 energy successfully entered the qi sea. A glimmer of joy appeared on Qin Sang's face, quickly replaced by seriousness and caution.</p><p>Next was the final prohibition in creating the living corpse.</p><p>Although the process had been smooth until now, Qin Sang felt a nagging worry.</p><p>Would the modified prohibition, painstakingly researched and altered by Wu Shang, truly succeed as described in his notes, or would unforeseen complications arise?</p><p>If this step failed, the subsequent step of incorporating the pill would be impossible.</p><p>Now was the time to find out!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened slightly.  He formed hand seals, his movements becoming incredibly fast and intricate, countless complex seals forming before him and then floating towards him under his guidance.</p><p>Finally, the last seal was complete!</p><p>"Merge!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly flipped his palm and without hesitation, pressed it against his dantian.</p><p>The prohibition merged!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned pale. The intense pain from his qi sea caused his body to tremble violently, forcing a muffled groan from him as he clutched his dantian.</p><p>Within his qi sea, the conflict between spiritual energy and earth-bound煞 energy created a raging storm, instantly overwhelming Qin Sang's control. The barrier constructed from five-element Yin objects showed signs of instability.</p><p>Fortunately, their existence gave Qin Sang a chance to breathe.</p><p>He took a deep breath, straightened up abruptly, and a fierce glint flashed in his eyes.  He focused all his attention, using his previous experience with corpse refinement to try and suppress the unruly earth-bound煞 energy.</p><p>Initially, the prohibitions on his body threatened to collapse, and the earth-bound煞 energy in his dantian resisted fiercely.  But as time passed, the fluctuations on Qin Sang's body gradually subsided, and his expression grew calmer.</p><p>At one point, the pain in his dantian suddenly vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned, quickly inspecting his dantian. He found that the storm in his qi sea had subsided and stabilized, with the earth-bound煞 energy and spiritual energy coexisting peacefully, each occupying half of his qi sea.</p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, both the earth-bound煞 energy and spiritual energy each branched off a stream, merging and flowing calmly into his meridians, beginning to circulate.</p><p>Success?</p><p>A wave of joy washed over Qin Sang. He stood up, moved his limbs, and carefully sensed the changes in his body.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang opened his eyes, his expression a mixture of joy and worry.</p><p>The joy stemmed from the fact that Wu Shang's notes were truthful, each point verified on Qin Sang's body, revealing that Wu Shang had spared no detail in recording his secret method.  Qin Sang successfully completed this step. The moment the prohibition was completed, his corpse transformation accelerated sharply, but it was far less advanced than a true living corpse.  This was thanks to Wu Shang's modification of the prohibition, and it was only because of Qin Sang's precise control that he could barely complete it.</p><p>In the short term, the corpse transformation could be controlled to an acceptable level. As long as he timely released the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the corpse refinement prohibition, recovery would be easy.</p><p>His worry came from the fact that the circulation routes of the earth-bound煞 energy and spiritual energy within his body were not those of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation* method, but were rigidly restricted to a fixed route by the corpse refinement prohibition.</p><p>No matter how Qin Sang tried, he couldn't change it.</p><p>Qin Sang moved his mind, and spiritual energy and煞 energy erupted from his palm, their combined power even stronger than before the transformation.</p><p>Apparently, their use in combat was unaffected, but further cultivation was impossible.</p><p>Even though his consciousness remained, his inability to cultivate meant that his cultivation could not progress further, trapped at this moment.</p><p>To make matters worse, the *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation* method was restricted, and the two divine abilities within it—Man-Sword Unity, Shadowless Escape, and Sword Qi Thunder—were unusable.</p><p>Qin Sang's greatest asset, the Sword Qi and Thunder Sound techniques, had been weakened.  Losing them significantly hampered his power and speed.</p><p>Fortunately, the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* (Soul Cultivation Sword Chapter) was only restricted, not replaced.  While his abilities were temporarily unavailable, his ebony sword, his life-bound spiritual weapon, remained under his control, offering considerable support.  Years of practice with two powerful techniques had given him superior swordsmanship compared to other cultivators.</p><p>However, would this change after creating the Corpse Pill?  Wu Shang had only used earth-sha spirit energy to refine his pill, whereas Qin Sang intended to use both earth-sha and heaven-yang energy – fundamentally different approaches with potentially different outcomes. Wu Shang's experience might not apply.  This very uncertainty was why Qin Sang dared to try.</p><p>[Read books and earn cash] Follow vx public account [Book Friend Base Camp] to earn cash while reading!</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang took out the corpse puppet bag, his expression shifting between doubt and determination. He'd never practiced corpse refinement, and he wondered what it would feel like to be inside.</p><p>Hesitantly, he opened the bag and aimed it at himself.  Moments later, a puzzled expression crossed his face. Nothing happened.</p><p>Could the bag not contain him? Was it the jade Buddha? Or had Wu Shang significantly altered the corpse refinement restrictions, making Qin Sang not a true living corpse, thus causing conflict with the bag's restrictions?  Wu Shang, even after refining himself into a living corpse, never tried putting himself in the bag. Without a precedent, Qin Sang could only guess.</p><p>It wasn't likely due to retaining his intellect;  Qing Ting had once placed Senior Brother Jiang inside, even before he died.  However, Jiang had first been placed in a crystal coffin, possibly connected to the Sky Corpse Sect. Sadly, that coffin had been gifted to Tan Hao, precluding investigation.</p><p>Corpse puppet bags were difficult to refine.  Those of the Sky Corpse Sect appeared unremarkable but were unique to the sect and could contain living corpses. Other corpse-cultivation sects’ bags wouldn't work.  Only high-ranking members or those who rendered great service received them; the first half of the *Tian Yin Shi Jue* (Heaven Yin Corpse Scripture) didn't include the refining method.</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang tried several times to no avail, finally giving up and retrieving a coffin from his spatial pouch.</p>
