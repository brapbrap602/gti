<h1>Chapter 1367: Fragments of the Abyssal Ruins</h1><p>Chapter 1367: Fragments of the Abyssal Ruins</p><p>A deathly silence fell over the Ice Crystal Palace.</p><p>You could hear a pin drop.</p><p>The expressions of the others were no better than Yue Wu's.</p><p>Even those with strong wills, like the Yuan Ying cultivators, were all stunned, looking at Qin Sang as if he were a monster.</p><p>The junior disciples standing by couldn't sense any change in Qin Sang's cultivation, but seeing the strange looks on these Yuan Ying ancestors, they were too scared to speak, their expressions varied.</p><p>"What?  Are you all not welcoming me, Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang walked into the Ice Crystal Palace, letting out a light laugh.</p><p>"How could we dare! How could we dare!  Master Qin, please…"</p><p>The Yue Wu brothers, as if waking from a dream, apologized repeatedly, quickly welcoming him.</p><p>Previously, they had treated Qin Sang as an honored guest, thanking him for helping the Tianxing Alliance drive away the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>Now, their eyes held even more respect.</p><p>Respect for a powerful cultivator!</p><p>Autumn Iris, the fairy, gracefully rose, her beautiful eyes fixed on Qin Sang, as if trying to see through him. "Hehe… I didn't expect Daoist Qin to break through to mid-Yuan Ying in such a short time. Now, I'm no longer your match."</p><p>As soon as she said this, the entire hall was shocked.</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"Senior Qin broke through to mid-Yuan Ying?"</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>…</p><p>The junior disciples' eyes widened like bells, unable to believe it.</p><p>The Serpent King glanced at Jing Yu beside him, "Daoist Qin's breakthrough is good news. Was there a need to keep it such a secret?"</p><p>Jing Yu smiled wryly, looking at Qin Sang with a bit of reproach. "I only just left seclusion and came to the meeting at your invitation. I haven't even had a chance to ask the younger generation about it.  How could I know, Daoist Qin…"</p><p>Qin Sang had three Corpse Flower Blood Jades; Jing Yu knew that.</p><p>But she never imagined that Qin Sang could break through to mid-Yuan Ying so quickly.</p><p>His cultivation speed was truly astonishing.</p><p>If Old Man Ye were still alive, he would have been ashamed of himself, lamenting that another shocking talent had emerged from the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>Do bottlenecks not exist?</p><p>"Another earth-shattering talent has appeared among humans!"</p><p>The Serpent King sighed, his expression somewhat worried.</p><p>"Fortunately, it's Daoist Qin," Jing Yu suppressed the surprise in her eyes, and said.</p><p>The Serpent King nodded heavily. "That's right, fortunately it's Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang was invited to the main seat.</p><p>The atmosphere in the Ice Crystal Palace was still unusual; everyone's gaze was focused on Qin Sang.  It seemed that the meeting could hardly continue.</p><p>"I was just lucky.  I happened to gain some opportunities, and unexpectedly broke through the bottleneck in one go…"</p><p>Qin Sang said lightly.</p><p>The disbelief was clear in everyone's eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't explain further, and no one dared to ask.</p><p>After a round of sycophantic flattery, the meeting continued, but everyone was too shocked; they were all absent-minded and the meeting ended hastily.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had already learned what he wanted to know.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang no longer concealed it and publicly offered a reward in the Northern Star Alliance for the capture of Gui Mu and Tan Hao.</p><p>Based on the information he'd collected, Qin Sang guessed that Tan Hao and Gui Mu were most likely no longer in the Northern Star Realm; the reward was just to confirm this.</p><p>To find Tan Hao, he would probably have to leave the Northern Star Realm and go to the other three realms.</p><p>It just so happened that Qin Sang had just broken through, and his cultivation wouldn't improve much in the short term; he also wanted to travel.</p><p>With his current cultivation, he should be able to barely cross the storm belt. He had a Moonlit Rhinoceros Horn and wouldn't worry about getting lost in the storm. He had a better chance than others.</p><p>Before leaving, he needed to close himself off for a while to consolidate his cultivation, and there were a few other things to do.</p><p>The meeting ended.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Yu, instead of returning to the Green Sheep Temple, flew towards the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>They didn't need to flatter each other. Jing Yu simply asked Qin Sang about his experiences during his seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang then spoke about his plans.</p><p>"I'm afraid I can't go with Daoist Qin. Chi Lei's cultivation has improved, but I still need to personally oversee him.  Only after a long period of careful refinement can I feel comfortable letting him take the Corpse Flower Blood Jade…"</p><p>Jing Yu said apologetically.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't intended to bother Jing Yu.</p><p>With Jing Yu staying in the Northern Star Realm to manage the estate, no villains would dare to act rashly, allowing him to travel without worry.</p><p>Although the Green Sheep Temple was founded by Qin Sang in keeping with Yun Youzi's wishes, it was still something he created himself, and he didn't want it to decline so quickly.</p><p>"After I leave, I'll entrust the Green Sheep Temple to you," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Rest assured, Daoist Qin."</p><p>Jing Yu nodded, suddenly laughing. "Did you see the expressions of those old fellows? Your breakthrough was so shocking; even if you don't show up, no one will dare to touch the Green Sheep Temple for a thousand years…"</p><p>"What are you two talking about?  Why are you so happy?"</p><p>Autumn Iris, flying ahead, heard the laughter, slowed down, and looked back.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, catching up with Autumn Iris, and inquired about the situation of the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>Master Canghong was still tirelessly searching at the bottom of the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>“The outlook isn’t good…”</p><p>Fairy Qiu Zhi didn’t hide it.  “Master has found several locations, but they were all false leads. Only one place is suspected to be a fragment of the Abyssal Ruins, but it’s extremely chaotic and dangerous.  Many attempts have been made, all to no avail.  With Daoist Qin's help this time, we should be able to make progress!”</p><p>“Only one place in all these years?”</p><p>Seeing Fairy Qiu Zhi nod, Qin Sang felt a heavy heart.  The Abyssal Ruins were truly destroyed.</p><p>Upon reaching the Sinful Abyss, Fairy Qiu Zhi invited them to visit their sect.</p><p>A few hours later, the three of them entered the Heavenly Scar and met up with Master Canghong.</p><p>The bottom of the Heavenly Scar was far more dangerous than before. Fragments of ancient prohibitions were everywhere. The space itself was torn.</p><p>Currently, even Golden Core cultivators dared not venture too deep into the Heavenly Scar. Even someone as strong as Qin Sang and his companions had to proceed cautiously, avoiding the shimmering lights dancing everywhere.</p><p>These lights were turbulent currents, some coalescing into large swathes, others just thin streaks. If struck by these currents, and swept into an ancient prohibition or a spatial fissure, the outcome would be overwhelmingly dire.</p><p>Exploring this place for decades, Master Canghong’s expression revealed a hint of weariness.  Not to mention their shock at seeing Qin Sang's cultivation level.</p><p>The group arrived at their target location.</p><p>Seeing the scene before them, Qin Sang finally understood why there had been no progress for so long.  Ahead, the shimmering lights formed a continuous expanse, with ancient prohibitions, spatial fissures, and turbulent currents all intertwined. The suspected fragment of the Abyssal Ruins was located right in the heart of these lights.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. Taking such a huge risk, and it might not even contain the Blood Lake he sought – it wasn’t worthwhile.</p><p>Master Canghong urged him repeatedly, making promises. They knew Qin Sang possessed an extraordinary divine eye ability that would be invaluable here, and they had unsuccessfully sought his assistance from the Qingyang Temple many times.</p><p>Now that they had found him, how could they let him go?</p><p>After much consideration, Qin Sang agreed to help.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators rejoiced. They had been studying the area for a long time and finally found a breakthrough.</p><p>With Yuan Ying spirit puppets and Jing Yu protecting them on either side, Qin Sang activated his divine eye ability, guiding them through the impossible, searching for a path.</p><p>After several months, they finally made a new discovery, but then encountered another obstacle.  It was clear that a fragment of the Abyssal Ruins was inside, but sadly, it wasn't the Blood Lake.</p><p>The danger was too great.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to retreat, leaving Master Canghong and the others to continue their research.</p>
