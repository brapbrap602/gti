<h1>Chapter 477 Experiment</h1><p>Even his confidante was only revealed after he left his sect and completed his revenge.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the crystal, sensing its connection to the stone pillars and platform.</p><p>No mistake, the crystal was the 'key'!</p><p>Without the crystal, the door couldn't be opened, and Summit Peak couldn't be entered!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He flashed off the platform and dashed towards the exit of the hall, then abruptly stopped, his expression grave, not daring to take another step.</p><p>Outside the hall, a spatial rift lay across the exit.</p><p>There was only one rift, but the entire void around it was chaotic. Within the gray aura, unstable fluctuations seemed to faintly exist.</p><p>His cultivation was restricted to the Qi Refining stage, and he didn't dare to trespass.</p><p>Recalling Granny Jing's warning, Qin Sang slowly retreated, his heart gradually calming down. After thinking it through, he couldn't help but chuckle self-deprecatingly.</p><p>He didn't need to overthink it.</p><p>Regardless of Granny Jing's relationship with Senior Qing Zhu, it had nothing to do with him.</p><p>He only needed to know that the closer Granny Jing was to Senior Qing Zhu, the more credible her information was, which was a good thing for him.</p><p>Since Granny Jing was unwilling to mention it, it was best for him not to delve deeper. If he touched upon Granny Jing's taboo, it would backfire and offend her.</p><p>Having figured this out, Qin Sang stopped dwelling on it. He glanced at the crystal, calculated the time, and then turned his gaze to the handsome young man.</p><p>Qin Sang took the young man's storage pouch, opened it, and took out everything inside.</p><p>For a moment, the hall glittered with treasures, nearly blinding Qin Sang.</p><p>The spirit stones alone definitely exceeded ten thousand. Qin Sang didn't bother counting them and put them all away, casually tossing aside other less valuable items.</p><p>The remaining items were spirit pills, magical artifacts, talismans, and two sets of powerful restrictive tools.</p><p>The young man had already used one talisman, yet there were still two more in the pouch. These two talismans were quite peculiar, possibly inherited from the Yuan Mirage Sect. Qin Sang didn't dare keep them and planned to destroy them after entering Summit Peak.</p><p>The same went for the magical artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to heed Granny Jing's words and keep nothing, good or bad. The best pieces had already been destroyed in the battle, and the remaining ones weren't top-tier.</p><p>With the Ebony Sword and the Ten Yama Banners, no other magical artifacts could catch his eye.</p><p>He dared not take the two sets of restrictive tools, which were definitely meticulously refined by high-level cultivators of the Yuan Mirage Sect.</p><p>If it were an ordinary Yuan Mirage Sect disciple, he might have kept them. However, this involved not only the young man's identity but also two elders of the Yuan Mirage Sect. The matter was significant, and he couldn't be too cautious.</p><p>The combined value of all the items was less than a single Void Thunder, so Qin Sang wasn't too heartbroken.</p><p>He pushed them aside, along with the other "junk," and turned his gaze to the jade bottles, carefully examining them.</p><p>To his disappointment, none of the jade bottles contained spirit pills that could aid in Core Formation.</p><p>It made sense. The young man himself was at the Pseudo Core Formation stage. If he had such spirit pills, he would have used them himself and wouldn't have left them for others.</p><p>Fortunately, several jade bottles contained foundation-building and cultivation-enhancing spirit pills. One bottle was no less potent than the Dragon Departure Pill, likely leftovers from the young man.</p><p>There were still so many leftovers. Being connected really had its perks!</p><p>These spirit pills could help him reach the Pseudo Core Formation stage faster. Qin Sang happily took them out and placed them in new jade bottles.</p><p>As for the other spirit pills, most were for healing and recovery, which Qin Sang unhesitatingly consumed.</p><p>Besides these, what Qin Sang valued most was a jade slip called "Fragments of the Grand Profound Formation." It recorded several spirit formations that Qin Sang found quite ingenious at first glance.</p><p>The content was very profound and couldn't be understood overnight. Qin Sang could only hastily memorize it.</p><p>After organizing everything, Qin Sang leisurely sized up the young man. This was the second Pseudo Core Formation expert he had captured alive, after Yu Hua.</p><p>In his view, the young man's value was no less than the Void Thunder.</p><p>Refining living corpses was difficult, with a low success rate. Qin Sang wasn't sure he could succeed on his first try with Yu Hua.</p><p>Although he couldn't take the young man out, he was perfect for practice.</p><p>The young man hadn't woken up yet.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a Celestial Corpse Talisman and, after some effort, implanted it into the young man's Nascent Soul space, suppressing his Nascent Soul. Then, he paused.</p><p>Here, his cultivation was restricted to the Qi Refining stage, limiting his abilities, which would also affect the refining process.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the platform, waiting patiently.</p><p>Finally, fifteen minutes passed.</p><p>Following Granny Jing's instructions, Qin Sang activated the crystal.</p><p>The door on the platform slowly opened, revealing the familiar chaotic scene. Without hesitation, Qin Sang grabbed the young man and leaped into the doorway.</p><p>Another dizzying sensation followed, and soon, he felt the solid ground beneath his feet again.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief and quickly opened his eyes. He found the plaza completely transformed. The stone pillar fragments had turned to dust, and the large stone slabs surrounding the plaza hadn't been spared either, mostly cracked into several pieces, covered in fissures.</p><p>Fortunately, the slabs hadn't completely shattered, and the plaza's original shape was still vaguely discernible.</p><p>The void had stabilized, and the darkness that threatened to devour everything had vanished without a trace. Everything in the space returned to normal.</p><p>What a powerful formation!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly amazed. It could even suppress a shattered space; how powerful must it have been when intact?</p><p>There was no time to lose. After a quick look around to ensure everything was alright, Qin Sang immediately began the corpse refinement process.</p><p>He had already prepared ample Yin materials of the Five Elements, and there was still plenty of Earthly Yin Qi in the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle.</p><p>Laying the young man flat on the ground, Qin Sang tapped his fingers on his body, completing a set of restrictions. Then, he picked up a piece of Blue Nether Gold...</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the young man without blinking, meticulously completing each step, observing his changes.</p><p>It wasn't his first time refining a living corpse, and his technique was already quite proficient. However, he soon discovered that there was a significant difference between Pseudo Core Formation and late-stage Core Formation.</p><p>...</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A muffled sound suddenly erupted from the young man's dantian, followed by an explosion.</p><p>Rampaging Earthly Yin Qi gushed out, and the young man's flesh and blood exploded in all directions. He didn't even have time to grunt before he perished, his body and bones completely obliterated.</p><p>The Earthly Yin Qi continued to surge outwards.</p><p>Qin Sang nimbly dodged, his face darkening.</p><p>As expected, the refinement had failed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't expected the failure to come so quickly. He had only managed to fuse one stream of Earthly Yin Qi into the young man when a violent conflict occurred while fusing the second stream.</p><p>He tried his best to salvage the situation, but to no avail, ultimately resulting in the explosion.</p><p>Qin Sang replayed the entire process in his mind. He believed the main reason for the failure was his insufficient cultivation. If he were at the Pseudo Core Formation stage, his control would have been different, and he could have suppressed the conflict.</p>
