<h1>Chapter 432: Each One's Escape</h1><p>Forming a Gold Core wasn't as easy as Cang Ling made it sound. However, given the Han family head's talent and the favor of a Gold Core cultivator, his chances were much higher than others'. Such opportunities couldn't be envied.</p><p>As they spoke, they finally flew out of the Chaotic Isles' waters.  Everyone concealed their auras, skimming the surface as they continued to fly.</p><p>Not long after they left, everyone stopped abruptly and looked up at the distant sky, their expressions varied.</p><p>It was noon. The sun was shining brightly, and the sky was cloudless.  The clear blue sky was spotless.</p><p>But in the south, where the water met the sky, a crimson cloud formation was exceptionally conspicuous, covering a large area.</p><p>The red cloud churned, as if hiding countless man-eating monsters within. Even from this distance, Qin Sang could faintly sense a terrifying aura emanating from it, causing his heart to pound.</p><p>This kind of red cloud was definitely not naturally formed in the Cloudmire Great Marsh. The battlefield was there!</p><p>"Be careful, everyone." Cang Ling reminded them. His robe flashed, then became transparent, and his aura converged to its limit, perfectly concealed.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly performed the *Spirit Concealment Art*.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he took out a three-foot-long azure blade and held it in his hand. This spirit sword was the best one he had crafted in his years of sword-making. It was a top-grade spirit sword infused with Frostmetal, ranking among the best of its kind.  </p><p>Qin Sang had forged countless swords, but he had only ever created one like this.</p><p>After years of use, his Frostmetal was gone, so Qin Sang named this sword "Frostmetal" to commemorate it.</p><p>However, the Frostmetal Sword was far inferior to the Ebony Sword, not solely because the Ebony Sword was a magical treasure.</p><p>The gap between the two wasn't just in quality.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was Qin Sang's life-bound spirit sword!</p><p>His cultivation technique, its associated divine ability, and his life-bound spirit sword formed a trinity, none dispensable. The Sword Qi Thunderclap divine ability could only be used through the Ebony Sword.</p><p>No matter how high the quality of other spirit swords, in Qin Sang's hands, they couldn't perform the Sword Qi Thunderclap, making them less powerful than the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Once he lost the Ebony Sword, his strength would inevitably decline sharply.</p><p>Although the Ebony Sword was powerful, it wasn't wise to use it openly in this situation.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was Qin Sang's life-bound spirit sword, cultivated with his mind and spirit. While he could minimize its aura as a magical treasure for a short time, this concealment wouldn't last. Especially in battle, if he was in danger and couldn't maintain focus, it would be easy for him to reveal a flaw.</p><p>Magical treasures were precious even to Gold Core cultivators.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator wielding a magical treasure, in the eyes of a Gold Core cultivator, was like a child flaunting gold, inviting trouble. Who could guarantee they wouldn't be tempted?</p><p>There were plenty of Gold Core cultivators on the battlefield. If Qin Sang revealed a flaw, it was impossible to hide it from their senses, and what followed might be utter destruction.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang had decided to avoid using the Ebony Sword unless absolutely necessary. Even if he had to, he would find a secluded spot far from the battlefield.</p><p>Or, he would save it as a surprise tactic.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Frostmetal Sword in one hand and the Yin-Yang Compass in the other.  In a chaotic battle, the Yin-Yang Compass could be surprisingly effective.</p><p>The others also made their preparations.</p><p>Qin Sang caught up with Cang Ling. The three late-Foundation Establishment cultivators led the way, followed by the others.</p><p>They continued to fly, and the crimson cloud formation in their view became increasingly clear.</p><p>This cloud formation was exceptionally vast, almost staining half the sky, and even the Cloudmire Great Marsh wasn't spared.  That area of water was dyed crimson, with towering waves and a startling momentum.</p><p>The cloud formation churned like the crimson glow of the setting sun.</p><p>Their vision was blocked by the crimson cloud formation. They couldn't see who was fighting inside, how many people were on the battlefield, or which side had the upper hand.</p><p>Without a clear understanding of the situation, they couldn't make a decision.</p><p>Everyone was restless and uneasy, cursing Pei Qin's ancestors a thousand times over in their minds.</p><p>Just then, a resounding dragon's roar came from afar.</p><p>The crimson cloud formation suddenly split open from the middle, as if someone had slashed it with a sword from within.</p><p>Then, a deep blue sword light pierced through the crimson cloud formation, weaving like a dragon in and out. The sword light was incredibly sharp, drawing in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, transforming into a terrifying hurricane, sweeping out countless blades.</p><p>The crimson cloud formation was severely damaged by the sword light, but it was far from dissipating.</p><p>Judging by its power, the sword light definitely housed a magical treasure!</p><p>Everyone was astonished by the sudden appearance of the magical treasure.</p><p>The crimson cloud formation could contend with a magical treasure. Was it also a magical treasure?</p><p>With two magical treasures clashing, they couldn't tell which side had the upper hand, nor could they determine which side to root for because they didn't know who owned these treasures.</p><p>Soon, they realized that the essence within the deep blue sword light seemed to be not a spirit sword, but a needle-shaped magical treasure!</p><p>"It's Senior Martial Uncle Fang's Heaven-Piercing Needle!" Qiao Jiang pointed at the sword light, his expression suddenly filled with excitement. "The Heaven-Piercing Needle is Senior Martial Uncle Fang's life-bound magical treasure! Everyone in our Illusory Spirit Sect knows it! Senior Martial Uncle Fang is alright, we don't have to worry!"</p><p>Hearing this, everyone's worried hearts finally settled somewhat.</p><p>It was this Senior Martial Uncle Fang who had sent the Liu cultivator to the trade fair for help.</p><p>Everyone had been terrified by the Liu cultivator's tragic state, fearing that Senior Martial Uncle Fang was also critically injured.</p><p>Seeing the terrifying power displayed by the Heaven-Piercing Needle, it seemed Senior Martial Uncle Fang's situation wasn't as dire as they had imagined. He wasn't severely injured and fleeing for his life.</p><p>Now with Pei Qin's assistance, the Small Cold Region side could at least hold their ground and wouldn't collapse immediately.</p><p>"Let's go! Get closer and see!" Cang Ling gritted his teeth and accelerated.</p><p>They were still far from the battlefield. With the cloud formation obscuring everything, they couldn't see what the real battlefield was like.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, glanced at Cang Ling's back, hesitated for a moment, then followed.</p><p>His vigilance was raised to the highest level.</p><p>Their speed gradually decreased as they cautiously approached the cloud formation.  They still couldn't see anything, only hearing bursts of spiritual energy roaring ahead.</p><p>After advancing like this for a while, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He stopped abruptly and waved his hand backward.</p><p>Cang Ling and Fan Zhen were only slightly slower than Qin Sang, almost stopping at the same time.</p><p>The three of them looked at the water ahead, exchanged glances, and then moved simultaneously!</p><p>To prepare for the upcoming battle, they had rehearsed their formation beforehand. They were perfectly coordinated. Qin Sang and Fan Zhen flanked left and right, while Cang Ling flew straight ahead, reaching a specific area of water and surrounding it.</p><p>The others looked at each other in confusion, not knowing what was happening, and stayed where they were, not daring to move.</p><p>Before the three could settle into position, a splash erupted.</p><p>A dark figure shot out of the water like an arrow, incredibly fast, about to break through their encirclement.</p>
