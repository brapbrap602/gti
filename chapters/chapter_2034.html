<h1>Chapter 2025:  The Sleeping Spirit</h1><p>These gall crystals might be incredibly effective even for Sky-Eyed Butterflies that have undergone six transformations—a serendipitous find.</p><p>‘Buzz…buzz…’</p><p>As Qin Sang approached the flowering tree, the sacrificial insects sensed the threat and went into a frenzy to protect the gall crystals.</p><p>The swarm surrounded Qin Sang, their rapid buzzing accompanied by visible yellow waves attacking his spirit.</p><p>Despite being caught in this maelstrom, Qin Sang remained unaffected, his gaze clear as he drew closer to the tree.</p><p>Seeing their attacks were futile, the frenzied insects began ramming into Qin Sang, only to be flung away by his Ming Shan armor. Some were pulverized instantly; their efforts were as futile as a mantis trying to stop a chariot.</p><p>Unharmed, Qin Sang reached the tree, plucked a vial containing the crystals, weighed it in his hand, and stowed it away with satisfaction.</p><p>This action further enraged the insects. Several larger sacrificial insects, many times the size of the others and possessing sharp fangs on either side of their mandibles, emerged from the swarm, emitting a piercing shriek at Qin Sang.</p><p>This caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>The methods of the Wu tribe for cultivating sacrificial insects are closely guarded secrets, unique to each clan. He didn't know how to cultivate them, nor could he subdue this swarm, but he could try to take a few of these special insects—perhaps he could glean some insights.</p><p>Sacrificial insects are not only useful in ceremonies and gall crystal production, but have many other applications.</p><p>He lacked the backing of a Wu tribe clan, but he had the entire Storm World. If he could cultivate his own sacrificial insects, it would greatly benefit the Storm World. However, the difficulty of cultivating them was immense, and Qin Sang was not confident.</p><p>A flash of sword light cleaved dozens of insects in two, appearing above one of the special insects.</p><p>This special insect was extremely aggressive, daring to attack the Grey Heron Sword, but it was ensnared by the sword light. Despite struggling, it couldn't break free and was flung back.</p><p>Qin Sang captured it, storing it in his spirit beast pouch, then repeated the process for the remaining special insects.</p><p>The insect cloud thinned considerably, the ground beneath littered with corpses. With their leaders captured, the swarm's attacks significantly weakened.</p><p>A whooshing sound approached from behind.  Pei Gongfeng arrived, his gaze sweeping over the tree. The vial containing the gall crystals was gone, but the lingering scent remained.</p><p>His pupils constricted. Pei Gongfeng looked intently at Qin Sang.  "Elder Qin seems quite knowledgeable about this place?"</p><p>"My pursuits extend beyond mere refinement; I also keep a few spirit insects. There are rumors that our human race's insect control techniques originally stemmed from Wu tribe heritage.  Driven by curiosity, I collected some ancient texts and unearthed numerous records on Wu tribe insect control techniques.  Unfortunately, relations between humans and the Wu tribe are strained; the Fengju Jade Gate is a formidable barrier. Otherwise, I might have visited the Wu tribe to seek instruction personally," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"Elder Qin is indeed erudite," Pei Gongfeng nodded, offering praise. Whether he believed Qin Sang's explanation was another matter.</p><p>At this point, the Xin family also caught up. Even if they suspected the presence of treasure, seeing even Pei Gongfeng hadn't thoroughly investigated, they dared not ask any further questions.</p><p>With the sacrificial insect threat neutralized, the group pressed on.  Unexpectedly, they found no entrance to a lower level; the space ahead seemed infinitely vast, with mountains rising and falling, becoming increasingly barren and dark, ominously reminding everyone they might be inside a tomb.</p><p>After flying for a while without further incident, they encountered an unusual sight.</p><p>Atop a mountain ahead stood a uniquely shaped high platform.  The mountain was devoid of any vegetation; the rocks appeared stained black, giving the entire mountain a grim and eerie feeling.</p><p>The platform was empty, yet the sight stopped everyone in their tracks.</p><p>The platform occupied almost the entire summit, surrounded on three sides by sheer cliffs, with a stone staircase leading down to the foot—clearly a meticulously constructed structure. The wear on the steps wasn't solely due to erosion; it clearly showed signs of prolonged use.</p><p>This indicated that someone had once lived here!</p><p>From afar, Pei Gongfeng studied the platform. "Elder Qin, with your extensive knowledge, what is that platform used for?"</p><p>"It might be a Wu tribe sacrificial altar."</p><p>Qin Sang mused. In ancient times, Wu tribe clans often built altars on the highest points, believing it facilitated communication with heaven and earth.</p><p>And this mountain was the highest peak in the vicinity.</p><p>Sacrificial insects, a sacrificial altar…could this have been the dwelling place of a Wu tribe clan? But why would anyone build their dwelling to resemble a tomb?</p><p>Qin Sang found this place increasingly enigmatic.</p><p>"It's the Wu tribe again!" Pei Gongfeng frowned.</p><p>The Wu tribe and the human race have different heritages. Some things defy logic, and unexpected variables may arise, beyond his control.</p><p>"I recall Daoist Friend Xin has never displayed Wu tribe abilities," Pei Gongfeng stared into Young Miss Xin's eyes.</p><p>The mere gaze put immense pressure on Young Miss Xin.  Her body trembled slightly, and she softly said, "Senior Pei is right. My father never mentioned the Wu tribe to me."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Pei Gongfeng's expression shifted. "So, Daoist Friend Xin doesn't know this place is connected to the Wu tribe?"</p><p>If so, the Xin family might not know as much about this tomb as previously thought.</p><p>A flicker of anxiety crossed Steward Luo's eyes. The gaze of a Transcendence Realm cultivator was too sharp; no detail escaped them.  Once they deemed the Xin family worthless, the situation could reverse, and the best outcome for the Xin family would be a few scraps, or they might be completely expelled.</p><p>Young Miss Xin remained relatively calm. "Father never personally entered. He only obtained some clues about this place and made inferences. He may have been unsure about some information and worried it would mislead me, so he didn't mention it."</p><p>"Is that so?  Inviting Elder Qin was the right move," Pei Gongfeng smiled at Qin Sang. "Elder Qin understands the Wu tribe far better than we do.  We'll rely on your expertise for the journey ahead."</p><p>"I'll do my best," Qin Sang replied flatly.</p><p>The group bypassed the altar and continued forward, flying over countless mountains.  Suddenly, the sound of rushing water echoed from ahead.</p><p>It was the sound of waves crashing against a shore.  They flew forward and saw it—a vast expanse of water, an ocean within the tomb!</p><p>The waves were not high, gently lapping against the rocks.  Strangely, the water was black.</p><p>There were no islands on the surface; the depths were as dark as ink, shrouded in mystery.</p><p>"Is it further ahead?" Pei Gongfeng asked Young Miss Xin.</p><p>Young Miss Xin nodded.</p><p>"I'll lead the way. You follow me, and Elder Qin will bring up the rear.  This prevents surprises.  Elder Qin, do you agree?" Pei Gongfeng made the arrangements.</p><p>Elder Qin had no objections.</p><p>This formation seemed advantageous for the Xin family, but Pei Gongfeng didn't consult Young Miss Xin. The Xin family cultivators sensed the change in Pei Gongfeng's attitude. Gazing at the gloomy sky, they felt uncertain about the future, filled with secret worry.</p><p>Nothing was apparent from the shore, so they flew out to sea according to Pei Gongfeng's plan, deeper into the black ocean.</p><p>The inky black water held no visible life; apart from the sound of the waves, there was utter silence. The eerie atmosphere heightened everyone's tension.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng claimed to lead the way, but after flying some distance, he seemed to sense something and unceremoniously dispatched two Xin family cultivators to scout ahead.</p><p>Those two Xin family cultivators looked at Young Miss Xin, but she couldn't openly defy Pei Gongfeng and could only silently nod.</p><p>The open sea offered complete visibility, with no signs of danger beneath the surface.  Just as everyone thought Pei Gongfeng was being overly cautious, they were astonished to see the two Xin family cultivators vanish before their eyes.</p><p>The Xin family's faces changed dramatically. "What happened? Where did Lao Wu and the other go?"</p><p>A slight smile played on Pei Gongfeng's lips as he turned to Qin Sang. "Elder Qin, do you see anything?"</p><p>"Spatial distortion!"</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>The surface appeared normal, but it was actually two different spaces, like two small universes stitched together. Fractured space is common in Feng Ju Yu Men, but such calm, almost imperceptible distortion, with seamless passage, was unprecedented.</p><p>"That might not be the reason. It could be some kind of formation," Pei Gongfeng shook his head.</p><p>Flickering light appeared ahead; the two Xin family cultivators reappeared, their relieved expressions showing they had also lost sight of the others.</p><p>The group entered the new space, finding an identical black sea, only with stronger winds.</p><p>They continued to fly, the wind intensifying, the sky growing darker.</p><p>"Something's wrong."</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>"Indeed. Be careful. Where's that treasure bell? Use it!" Pei Gongfeng unceremoniously ordered the Xin family cultivators.</p><p>Young Miss Xin summoned the bell, its radiance enveloping the Xin family cultivators.</p><p>At the same time, a fierce gale erupted, instantly filling the sky with dark clouds.  A dull rumble of thunder echoed across the sea.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder roared, a storm approaching.</p><p>Initially, everyone was relaxed, but that quickly changed.  Lightning bolts converged from all directions above them, gathering in terrifying numbers.  The air was heavy with dread.</p><p>Except for the absence of Heavenly Tribulation pressure, the scene was comparable to an imminent Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>“No good! Run!”</p><p>Pei Gongfeng’s expression changed slightly, and his speed increased immediately. The space here wasn't uniform; escaping this area should allow them to evade the danger.</p><p>Even Pei Gongfeng was fleeing, so one can imagine the state of the Xin family cultivators.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Countless bolts of lightning poured down, illuminating the sea like daylight.  Everyone was instantly engulfed in lightning.</p><p>Yu Ruyi circled above Pei Gongfeng’s head, preventing the surrounding lightning from striking him.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding her sword, repeatedly slashed through the lightning, glancing at the Xin family members.</p><p>The precious bell was more effective against spirit attacks and was less useful here.  Butler Luo quickly summoned a long banner; everyone jointly activated it, and the banner unfurled, enveloping them.</p><p>Under the continuous bombardment of lightning, the banner surface vibrated constantly, emitting waves of dark light.</p><p>While it seemed to block the lightning, the real danger had only just begun.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng simultaneously looked upwards.</p><p>“Danger!”</p><p>At this instant, a warning surged through their hearts; they both sensed a dangerous aura from the dark clouds.</p><p>This aura appeared without warning, suddenly emerging—an aura that could threaten even Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>Almost the instant the warning appeared, a beam of light shot from the dark clouds. Unlike the previous lightning, this was shaped like a giant crescent moon, swiftly cutting through the void, sweeping across the entire space.</p><p>The attack came too suddenly.  Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng couldn't escape in time and could only endure it.</p><p>As the saying goes, each sweeps their own doorstep.  Without knowing the power of the crescent moon lightning, their priority was to protect themselves, and they didn't immediately intervene to protect the Xin family members.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed the actions of Young Master Xin, using this opportunity to force out more of the Xin family's trump cards.  Presumably, Pei Gongfeng thought the same.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The crescent moon lightning struck, its momentum astonishing.</p><p>Everyone was instantly swallowed by the lightning; the surroundings were a brilliant white, and the violent power of the thunder surged towards them.</p><p>As the lightning raged like a sea, a sword light suddenly appeared, bursting forth with incredible sword intent, fiercely cutting through the lightning – Qin Sang, wielding the Grey Warbler Sword, charged against the current.</p><p>From her elevated position, Qin Sang saw a mass of blue light emerge from beneath the lightning. Pei Gongfeng also broke through under the protection of Yu Ruyi.</p><p>They exchanged a glance and simultaneously looked towards the Xin family members.</p><p>This crescent moon lightning undoubtedly possessed the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator; they had to be careful, and if the Xin family didn't handle it properly, some might perish.</p><p>What followed surprised Qin Sang and Pei Gongfeng greatly.</p><p>A blade of energy, a hundred meters long, appeared, only slightly slower than the lightning, possessing an aura capable of tearing through anything. It fiercely ripped through the lightning.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, Young Master Xin, leading the Xin family members, flew out from the gap created by the blade energy. The Xin family members’ faces still bore expressions of terror, but they were unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze sharpened as she looked at Young Master Xin, her eyes finally settling on her back. Behind her was a faint shadow, seemingly her own, clinging tightly to her body.</p><p>“This is the Xin family's inherited Mingling, isn’t it? I didn't expect that you, Xin Sheng, could already control it so freely. Truly amazing talent!”</p><p>Pei Gongfeng recognized the origin of the shadow and exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>No one noticed the flash of joy in Pei Gongfeng’s eyes.  Forcing Young Master Xin to summon the Mingling here was precisely what he wanted.</p><p>Young Master Xin's face showed no complacency; her breathing was somewhat rapid, and bloodshot veins appeared in her eyes, which were as bright as jade, suggesting that summoning the Mingling had taken a considerable toll.</p><p>Seeing that the dark clouds still hadn't dispersed, Young Master Xin didn't dare hesitate and quickly led the Xin family members forward.</p><p>…</p><p>As Qin Sang and the others sped across the dark sea, they were completely unaware of the changes behind them.</p><p>Outside the tomb, a gentle breeze passed, and an old man appeared out of thin air.</p><p>The old man had snow-white hair and a youthful complexion. He looked at the ancient prohibitions on the stone gate, which had been broken, stroked his white beard lightly, and smiled smugly.</p><p>“Humph! Old Pei, you think that with you and that greenhorn from the Xin family, those little tricks can escape my notice?  Daring to treat the Xin family as your private possession... I want to see what else you’ve got…”</p><p>Before he could finish, the old man's figure flickered, silently passing through the crack in the stone gate, transforming into a wisp of smoke and following them down the tomb passage.</p>
