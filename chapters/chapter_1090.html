<h1>Chapter 182: The Scramble</h1><p>All eyes instantly focused on the two Demon Kings.</p><p>Everyone watched intently.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King brandished his golden spear, coordinating with the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's shell, believing their victory was assured.</p><p>Flames and the crimson barrier intertwined.</p><p>The crimson barrier seemed to be melting, about to be pierced by the flames conjured from the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>As the two demons were about to breach the barrier and escape with the Heavenly Phoenix Plume,</p><p>the Flood Dragon King's smile suddenly froze, his face contorting in shock and rage.</p><p>"Who?!"</p><p>the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise roared.</p><p>Before he could finish, darkness descended upon the two demons.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The tortoise shell shuddered violently.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's face paled, and he coughed up blood.</p><p>A slender hand, seemingly emerging from the void, appeared as if from nowhere, pressing against the tortoise shell. The shell's mystical light dimmed, and cracks appeared on its surface.</p><p>Then, the Ancient Devil's soul fragment materialized, its gaze cold, tinged with greed and madness, filling the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise with terror.</p><p>Simultaneously, a furious roar came from behind, where the Flood Dragon King stood.</p><p>Beside the Flood Dragon King, Mo Qingzhu appeared without warning, her expression vacant as she stared fixedly at him.  With a swift grab, she unleashed a torrent of True Demonic Qi.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu and the Ancient Devil's soul fragment acted in perfect coordination.</p><p>While the soul fragment assaulted the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise, Mo Qingzhu directly engaged the Flood Dragon King.</p><p>It was unclear what secret technique Mo Qingzhu employed, but a rustling sound emanated from the True Demonic Qi. Countless black chains, writhing like pythons, emerged from within, swiftly darting towards the Flood Dragon King, enveloping him.</p><p>At that moment, the distant illusions of the Ancient Devil's main body and Qingzhu slowly dissipated.</p><p>The human cultivators, having previously faced the Ancient Devil's soul fragment, were aware of its power and remained vigilant, ready to assist each other.</p><p>The Grand Shaman and Elder Fang Mo, while discussing strategy with the humans, had also been warned.</p><p>Only the Flood Dragon King and the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise, unaware of the situation, had received no warning about the Ancient Devil's strength. They were also preoccupied with guarding against the cultivators, and hadn't expected the Ancient Devil's speed and terrifying power.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King wasn't completely unprepared.</p><p>He had communicated with the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise and had already summoned his golden spear and donned his golden armor, preparing his Dragon Clan's divine abilities.</p><p>Although numerous, the cultivators present were at most equal to him in cultivation level.  Together with the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise, he believed they could withstand a siege, at least for a short while.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Plume's power had been activated.</p><p>In the next moment, they would be able to break through the crimson barrier and escape.</p><p>No one could stop them.</p><p>Yet, at the last moment, the unexpected occurred.</p><p>Seeing Mo Qingzhu so close, and meeting her blood-red eyes, a chill ran down the Flood Dragon King's spine.  As one of the most powerful beings in the two realms, he felt a foreboding sense of danger.</p><p>It had been a long time since he had experienced such a feeling of extreme peril.</p><p>The True Demonic Qi surrounded him.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Golden light erupted, and thousands of spear shadows burst forth, creating a dazzling spectacle.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King struck with all his might, his golden spear imbued with the Dragon Clan's divine power, radiating like a golden sun.</p><p>However, as the spear shadows entered the True Demonic Qi, they instantly dimmed.</p><p>*Swish, swish, swish...*</p><p>Countless chains filled the Flood Dragon King's vision, tearing apart the spear shadows, effortlessly neutralizing his attack in an instant.</p><p>The True Demonic Qi engulfed the golden spear and surged towards him.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King's expression changed completely. If he insisted on activating the Heavenly Phoenix Plume, he might die at Mo Qingzhu's hands.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Black Tortoise was also in grave danger and couldn't offer any assistance.</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment, having devoured three Nascent Souls, had battled three late-Nascent Soul cultivators on Mount Yitian.</p><p>Although it had paid a price to power the formation and destroy the altar, it was more than enough to deal with the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise, who was only at the peak of the mid-Transformation stage.</p><p>*Thump! Thump! Thump!*</p><p>Muffled sounds came from the tortoise shell in rapid succession, so fast that they could easily be mistaken for a single sound.</p><p>The jade hand, seemingly delicate, was a death warrant in the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's eyes.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The tortoise shell shattered.</p><p>This was a manifestation of the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's divine power, not his actual shell, but it still possessed formidable defensive capabilities. Yet, it was shattered by the Ancient Devil's soul fragment.</p><p>The fragments scattered, reverting to mystical water energy and transforming into a raging river that crashed against the Ancient Devil's soul fragment.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>The river was torn apart by the hand.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Just in the nick of time, the tortoise shell on the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's back flashed to the front, finally blocking the Ancient Devil's soul fragment's hand.</p><p>This shell, being the source of the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's life force, proved incredibly resilient and wasn't shattered.  However, his situation didn't improve in the slightest.</p><p>His blood churned, his True Essence stagnated, shocked by the Ancient Devil's soul fragment's terrifying power. Then, a figure flashed before his eyes, and his heart sank.</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>a streak of azure light shot out from the side, emitting astonishing fluctuations that sent shivers down the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's spine.</p><p>Simultaneously, he heard Fairy Nangui's voice transmission:</p><p>"The Flood Dragon King won't escape! Seize the Phoenix Plume, and all will be forgiven!"</p><p>As the Flood Dragon King summoned the Heavenly Phoenix Plume and the Ancient Devil's soul fragment launched its attack, the Demon Lord and others also made their move, converging on the scene.</p><p>However, they weren't necessarily there to rescue anyone.</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment had left a deep impression on them, and Mo Qingzhu, controlled by the Ancient Devil himself, was undoubtedly even stronger. The Flood Dragon King served as a test, confirming this fact.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Plume was their only hope of escape, and everyone's eyes were fixed on it.  At the very least, they couldn't let the Ancient Devil seize it.</p><p>The Grand Shaman and Elder Fang Mo's intentions were obvious.</p><p>Spirit Master and the Demon Lord had already formed an alliance.</p><p>Fairy Nangui and the Elder reacted just as quickly, but they didn't charge forward like the others.</p><p>Ignoring his injuries, the Elder forcibly activated the Sacrificial Yuan Technique, his cultivation level surging to match Fairy Nangui's.  The cost was steep, and he coughed up blood before stabilizing himself.</p><p>Together, they activated the Demon Subduing Stele.</p><p>During this time, the Stele had recovered some of its power, and with the combined efforts of two powerful cultivators, its might surpassed its previous state.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Demon Subduing Stele traversed the void, ambushing the Ancient Devil's soul fragment.</p><p>Their strategy differed from the others. They aimed to save the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise and then cooperate with him to seize the Heavenly Phoenix Plume. Being closest to the Flood Dragon King, the Tortoise had the best chance of success.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace had withdrawn from the world, taking refuge in a hidden realm within the storm belt at the edge of the North Sea Rain Desert. The Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's lair was within the Rain Desert.</p><p>He had deep ties to the Four Saints Palace and had once been under its protection.</p><p>However, after the Palace's decline, the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise broke free from their control. Now, he dared to collude with the demons of the Demon Sea and infiltrate the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>With his life on the line, the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise, unless a fool, knew what to do.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The Demon Subduing Stele arrived in an instant. The Ancient Devil's soul fragment, caught off guard, sensed the danger and paused momentarily.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Black Tortoise narrowly escaped, gaining a moment to breathe and assess the Flood Dragon King's predicament.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>A bit busy with the new year, just one chapter for today. Will try to make up for it tomorrow.</p>
