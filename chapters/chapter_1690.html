<h1>Chapter 1681: Nascent Soul Legacy</h1><p>Someone!</p><p>Slipping into the stone chamber, Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat as his eyes fell upon a figure facing the stone door.  He was instantly on high alert.</p><p>"No life aura…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression relaxed slightly. He'd been overthinking it.</p><p>The Witch Clan markings pointed directly to this person, the Nascent Soul expert the Ghost Mother sought. How could a Nascent Soul cultivator live for so long?</p><p>However, when dealing with ancient demons, nothing could be taken for granted.</p><p>His main body could perceive the situation outside through this avatar. That demonic body radiated an overwhelming demonic aura, something no cultivator could possess. It was most likely the ancient demon sealed within Emperor Bestowal Mountain by the Formless Immortal Sect, and its power far surpassed the Jade Bone Devil.</p><p>He was truly cursed to encounter ancient demons!</p><p>He still remembered Senior Qing Zhu, who fell at the hands of an ancient demon.  Even now, the thought filled Qin Sang with regret.</p><p>Caution was paramount.</p><p>Maintaining his protective罡fire shield, Qin Sang peered closer.</p><p>The corpse was remarkably well preserved.</p><p>The figure sat cross-legged.  He wasn't tall, his spine slightly curved, his cheeks hollow. His eyes were closed, his expression serene, like a scholar of fifty years.</p><p>He wore a long robe, adorned with vivid patterns and twisting designs in bright colors – attire that would appear strange to human cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>In the Boundless Sea, Witch Clan cultivators, both men and women, favored such elaborate attire. Some even painted their bodies with vibrant colors or adorned themselves with tattoos.</p><p>He sensed no powerful Nascent Soul aura from the figure.  Had he encountered him outside, Qin Sang might have mistaken him for a mortal and passed him by.</p><p>Perhaps he had reached a state of returning to one's original nature.</p><p>Or perhaps it was due to the passage of time.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense, scanning the figure thoroughly. He confirmed there were no anomalies; it was undoubtedly a corpse.</p><p>His expression turned solemn. He bowed respectfully towards the corpse, then surveyed the surroundings. He noticed a spirit formation beneath the body, clearly a Witch Clan secret formation.</p><p>Apart from that, there were no markings or inscriptions left.</p><p>This Nascent Soul Witch had perished here silently.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang's gaze settled on the figure's waist. Hanging there was a wooden gourd, fist-sized and exquisitely carved, lifelike in its detail.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered. He manipulated the Golden Sinking Sword to lift the wooden gourd, bringing it before him.  Resting it on the flat of the blade, he extended a wisp of divine sense to examine it.</p><p>A look of joy spread across Qin Sang's face. As he suspected, it wasn't a magical treasure but a spatial artifact similar to a Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>A Nascent Soul legacy!</p><p>The Ghost Mother had used this as bait to lure him into taking Dumb Auntie away.</p><p>He hadn't expected to actually obtain it.</p><p>Regardless of his current predicament, such a reward was cause for celebration, offering Qin Sang a sliver of solace.</p><p>However, acquiring the legacy wouldn't be easy.  Qin Sang detected restrictions placed by the original owner within the wooden gourd. One misstep could ruin everything.</p><p>Gazing at the wooden gourd, Qin Sang fell into deep thought. Finally, he glanced upwards. Since escape was currently impossible, he would focus on analyzing the gourd's restrictions.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flew from his dantian, perching on his shoulder. Its multifaceted eyes, shimmering with iridescent light, focused on the wooden gourd.</p><p>"A divine sense restriction…"</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang murmured, his expression easing somewhat.</p><p>The restriction was formed from a strand of the Nascent Soul Witch's divine sense.  Given the vast time elapsed since the Witch's demise, the divine sense within the restriction had weakened considerably.  For Qin Sang, this was the easiest type of restriction to break.</p><p>With the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's assistance, Qin Sang quickly deciphered the restriction's structure. Progress accelerated, and soon, confidence filled him as he transformed his divine sense into needles, piercing the wooden gourd.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A green light illuminated Qin Sang's face, bathing him and the entire chamber in an emerald glow.</p><p>As the light faded, the wooden gourd transformed. Its material shifted to jade, becoming crystalline and translucent.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly extended his divine sense into the gourd.  A look of surprise crossed his face as a beam of green light erupted from the opening, his divine sense drawing an object out.</p><p>A crescent-shaped stone platform!</p><p>The platform's surface was rough and scarred, crisscrossed with a chaotic web of marks. No discernible pattern could be seen.</p><p>It resembled an ordinary stone, but its placement within the gourd suggested the Nascent Soul Witch held it in high regard.</p><p>From the platform, Qin Sang sensed a familiar energy fluctuation.</p><p>Not only that, but the platform's shape was also strikingly familiar.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, an object appeared in Qin Sang's right palm – another stone platform.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously called it the Star Platform, acquired from a Witch Clan cultivator in the Orchid Fighting Sect. His breakthrough in the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art* had relied on it channeling stellar energy.</p><p>The two platforms were remarkably similar, differing only in the subtle details of their surface patterns. Their shapes were almost identical!</p><p>Qin Sang looked from one to the other.</p><p>The familiarity stemmed from the new platform's energy, almost identical to his previous Star Platform.  It was another Star Platform!</p><p>The old Star Platform had absorbed a substantial amount of stellar energy at Pointing Heaven Peak, undergoing a transformation. While it had reverted to its original unassuming form, it retained a certain indescribable mystique.</p><p>The newly acquired Star Platform possessed the same mystique, indicating the Nascent Soul Witch had already replenished its stellar energy.</p><p>Qin Sang brought his hands together.</p><p>The two platforms fit perfectly, forming a complete circular Star Platform.</p><p>Clearly, they were once one, somehow split and scattered.</p><p>Sudden realization dawned on Qin Sang. No wonder the Star Platform hadn't responded to his attempts over the years since its transformation at Pointing Heaven Peak. The treasure was incomplete!</p><p>One half he had brought back to the North Star Region, the other brought to the Central Continent by the Nascent Soul Witch.</p><p>By a twist of fate, he had reunited them.</p><p>Qin Sang separated his hands. He wouldn't combine the platforms here. He hadn't forgotten the Star Platform's ability to draw stellar energy directly from the stars.</p><p>The complete platform would undoubtedly be even more potent.</p><p>If he couldn't control it and inadvertently revealed his location, it would be a grave mistake.</p><p>He recalled the first Star Platform, snatched from the jaws of the Black Serpent Mountain's ancestor, who had sent a direct disciple to infiltrate the Orchid Fighting Sect and steal it.</p><p>Now, the Nascent Soul Witch had also treasured it, keeping it close.</p><p>This suggested the Star Platform was a significant Witch Clan treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't overly excited by its reunification.</p><p>The more precious the treasure, the more restrictions it typically possessed, like spiritual treasures, especially considering the vast differences between the two clans' bloodlines.  It was uncertain how much benefit a Witch Clan treasure could offer him. If it could accelerate his progress in the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*, Qin Sang would be content.</p><p>Putting aside his thoughts, Qin Sang stored both Star Platforms within his Thousand Jun Ring before turning his attention back to the wooden gourd, examining the remaining items.</p><p>His earlier assessment proved correct.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Witch's legacy contained many valuable treasures, but all crafted items bore strong Witch Clan markings.</p><p>The Boundless Sea Witch Clan's inheritance was incomplete, and they often borrowed from human cultivation.  Qin Sang could barely discern the purpose of these treasures, and he was certain most were unusable.</p><p>However, a few treasures were mentioned in the *Panhu True Scripture*.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't had the time to thoroughly study the scripture obtained from the Ghost Mother, but he knew he would eventually need to cultivate its techniques to further enhance the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Whether he recognized them or not, Qin Sang collected everything.</p><p>Finally, only miscellaneous items, a pile of spirit stones, and a jade box remained.</p><p>From the jade box, Qin Sang sensed an exceptionally comforting energy fluctuation.</p><p>'Click!'</p><p>The jade box opened slightly.</p><p>A gentle blue light spilled out, accompanied by an outpouring of incredibly dense spiritual energy, almost taking on a physical form.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively inhaled deeply, his breath catching in his throat.</p><p>Within the jade box lay a water-type spirit stone, its spiritual energy purer than any he had ever encountered. Tiny vortexes formed on the stone's surface, swirling with pure water-type spiritual energy.</p><p>"A top-grade spirit stone!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p>He had heard of top-grade spirit stones but had never seen one.</p><p>He was already a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, a former sect leader who had traveled extensively. This demonstrated the rarity of top-grade spirit stones.</p><p>High-grade spirit stones were considered scarce in the cultivation world.  Nascent Soul cultivators didn't always barter; high-grade spirit stones often served as currency.</p><p>They had many uses.</p><p>But no one treated top-grade spirit stones as mere currency; they were incredibly valuable treasures.</p><p>Excavating an entire giant spirit stone mine might not yield a single top-grade stone.</p><p>Top-grade spirit stones were not only essential components of certain ancient immortal formations, but they also held profound significance for cultivators themselves. Their incredibly pure spiritual energy could be directly converted into true essence without refinement.</p><p>Improving cultivation efficiency and saving time were crucial.</p><p>In dire straits, a top-grade spirit stone could be lifesaving, without the severe consequences of a Boiling Snow Pill.</p><p>Of course, comparing the two wasn't entirely fair. Absorbing a top-grade spirit stone required some time, while a Boiling Snow Pill instantly transformed into a surge of true essence.</p><p>Anyone who obtained a compatible top-grade spirit stone treasured it, rarely trading it away.</p><p>The benefits of Qin Sang's five spiritual roots manifested here.  He could utilize all five types of spirit stones, and the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* had no elemental restrictions.</p><p>He gazed at the spirit stone in the jade box, captivated, and experimentally drew a sliver of its energy into his body. The sensation was remarkably different from absorbing ordinary spirit stones, filling him with wonder.</p><p>Just then, the stone chamber began to shake violently.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang quickly gathered his belongings. Extending his divine sense beyond the chamber, he discovered the Five Elements Divine Restriction outside had become chaotic, the disturbance seemingly originating from the seal's core.</p><p>He then saw through his avatar the demonic body charging out of the mountain, its demonic aura surging.</p><p>Observing this, Qin Sang pondered, "I wonder how powerful this ancient demon is? If it can occupy the two Nascent Soul cultivators, preventing them from noticing me, I might be able to escape…"</p><p>On the other hand, he worried about the ancient demon's overwhelming strength.</p><p>The current number of Nascent Soul cultivators was fewer than during the Formless Immortal Sect's era. If the Central Continent was engulfed in a demonic tribulation, could he truly remain unaffected even if he escaped to the North Sea?</p><p>…</p><p>High above,</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King was quick to act despite her words.</p><p>She understood the significance of this ancient demon, possibly the last one remaining in this realm.</p><p>Her three long tails swayed gently.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King tilted her head back slightly, her alluring features taking on a sacred air.  The chaotic sky above the legacy grounds calmed, becoming preternaturally still.</p><p>Suddenly, a cool moonlight descended.</p><p>A bright moon had appeared in the sky, seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p>It was undoubtedly an illusion, but no one could discern its falsehood, believing the true moon had pierced through the formation and shone upon the legacy grounds.</p><p>The moonlight bathed a single figure.</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King, enveloped in the lunar glow, appeared ethereal, like a celestial maiden from the moon palace. She bowed gracefully towards the moon.</p><p>The Fox Spirit's Moon Salutation!</p><p>In the next instant, a massive, silver-disc-like moon appeared directly above the demonic body.  Moonlight flowed down like water, merging seamlessly with the tide below.</p><p>Everyone witnessed the celestial and terrestrial waters connecting, a dreamlike spectacle.  A barrier seemed to form, enclosing both the demonic body and everyone present.</p><p>The demonic body, positioned at the center, roared with increasing frenzy as it felt the immense pressure.</p><p>Seeing the Azure Fox Holy King take action, Fan Laomo and the others felt their doubts diminish.</p><p>Then, Holy Venerable Huiguang spoke once more, "To suppress this ancient demon, this poor monk will explore the legacy grounds with all of you. The treasures within, excluding scriptures, shall belong to those with the karmic connection.  In addition…"</p><p>His gaze swept over the crowd as he produced a jade bottle. "For those who contribute greatly to this battle, this poor monk has another reward."</p><p>The jade bottle in Huiguang's hand captured everyone's attention.</p><p>Inside was a mottled, strangely colored pill, resembling a failed alchemical concoction.</p><p>The worldly Fan Laomo instantly recognized something, his face a mixture of shock and realization.</p><p>Everyone noticed Fan Laomo's reaction, their curiosity piqued.</p><p>With the situation urgent, Huiguang didn't prolong the suspense.  "This is the Five Elements Pill. You must have all heard tales of this pill. After the collapse of the Unfettered Palace, it vanished from the cultivation world. As the name suggests, when one is at the bottleneck of Nascent Soul, consuming this pill allows for instantaneous attunement with the Heavenly Dao, to some extent mimicking the effects of five spiritual roots…"</p><p>The Azure Fox Holy King glanced at Huiguang, a hint of mockery flashing in her eyes.</p><p>"The Five Elements Pill!"</p><p>"The Unfettered Palace!"</p><p>…</p><p>So the Nascent Soul cultivators had indeed been trapped within the Unfettered Palace!</p><p>Learning the pill's origin, everyone present, except Qin Sang's avatar, was captivated. Even True Person Hegao's gaze was drawn to the pill.</p><p>They understood that Heavenly Resonance was the key to Nascent Soul.</p><p>There were secret techniques and supreme treasures that could mend spiritual roots, but most only addressed a single element. While the Five Elements Pill might be slightly less effective than those focused on a single element, it could simultaneously mend all five, offering far greater assistance!</p><p>Everyone stared intently at the pill within the jade bottle, no longer finding its appearance unsightly.</p><p>Great rewards motivated even the bravest.</p><p>Yet, these seasoned veterans weren't blinded by the reward.</p><p>The old monk was willing to offer such a precious pill as an incentive, indicating the immense danger posed by the demonic body. This pill would come at the cost of lives!</p><p>But no one could deny the Five Elements Pill's allure.</p><p>Legend held it was the foremost medicinal pill for breaking through to Nascent Soul, possibly surpassing even the Immortal Palace's Sword Tombs in efficacy.</p><p>Among those present, perhaps only Qin Sang could resist its temptation.</p><p>However, the appearance of the Five Elements Pill sparked a sudden thought in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>His avatar approached Mo Xingdao, "Fellow Daoist Mo, if I were to obtain the Five Elements Pill, would you exchange it for a Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit?"</p>
