<h1>Chapter 887: The Yuanshen</h1><p>Chapter 887: The Yuanshen</p><p>While the Avatar was lost in thought, the Daoist boy finished his lecture.</p><p>After answering a few of the Avatar's questions, the Daoist boy took him away from Jade Finger Peak.  Using a magical artifact, they flew across a large river, landing on a clifftop at the river's edge where a fiery red stone hall stood.</p><p>Before they drew near, a wave of intense heat washed over them.</p><p>This stone hall was constructed from a unique stone imbued with the power of flames, further reinforced by protective enchantments designed to preserve this fiery power.</p><p>This made activating spiritual flames far easier, significantly increasing efficiency during the refinement process.</p><p>The two stopped before the hall, not entering directly.</p><p>The Daoist boy sent out a burst of spiritual energy, activating the hall's protective seal.</p><p>Shortly after, a muffled sound of footsteps echoed from within, followed by a strong, bronze-skinned man striding out. His gaze swept over them.</p><p>"Brother Jinyan!"</p><p>The Daoist boy bowed respectfully.</p><p>Jinyan, initially looking angry, as if disturbed during an important task, softened slightly at the sight of the Daoist boy. He grumbled, "It's Junior Brother Yang! I heard Master Huayang took you as his personal attendant.  What are you doing gallivanting about?"</p><p>The man's voice boomed, reverberating through the hall. His words were blunt and direct.</p><p>The Daoist boy and Jinyan seemed to be quite familiar, unfazed by his demeanor.  The Daoist boy said, "Junior Brother has come to present you with a helper for your work."</p><p>The burly man's eyes narrowed. He glanced at the Avatar, chuckled, and said, "What can someone you bring be good for? If they don't cause trouble, that'll be a blessing! I've never seen this lad before. When did he join the sect?"</p><p>"Brother is so engrossed in refinement, it's understandable you haven't met him. Zhang Yue is a newly admitted disciple. I asked Master Lu to assign him to you."</p><p>The Daoist boy gestured to the Avatar. "He studied refinement before joining the sect, Brother can test him."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>The strong man sized up the Avatar without ceremony.  "Then come in and try it. I have a batch of materials that need refinement.  Junior Brother Yang, let's get this straight.  You know how much I have on my plate. I can't be expected to keep idle people for your Yin-Yang Sect. We're friends, but if you send me a good-for-nothing, I won't take them…"</p><p>"Naturally! If he were truly incompetent, I wouldn't dare bother Brother Jinyan."</p><p>The Daoist boy spoke with confidence.</p><p>Before coming, he had questioned the Avatar about his skills, confirming that his refinement abilities were quite good.</p><p>With that, the strong man opened the door, inviting them inside.</p><p>The heat inside the hall was even more intense.</p><p>The Avatar followed, entering a stone chamber where a large pile of purple ore lay.  He exclaimed, "So much Purple Wind Copper!"</p><p>This copper ore could be refined into Purple Wind Copper, ideal for creating metal-attribute magical artifacts.</p><p>Jinyan raised an eyebrow, "You recognize Purple Wind Copper at a glance. It seems Junior Brother Yang wasn't exaggerating. Choose a piece of ore and refine the Purple Wind Copper. Let me see your skills."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The Avatar bowed his head, calmly entered the chamber, selected a medium-sized piece of ore, and went to the furnace in the center of the room. Under Jinyan's guidance, he activated the enchantment.</p><p>…</p><p>An hour later, the Daoist boy flew out of the hall with a smile, heading straight back to Yin-Yang Peak.</p><p>The Avatar stood before the hall, examining the token in his hand.</p><p>With his proficiency in refinement, showing off only a portion of his skill would have been enough to astound them.  Of course, he wouldn't be that ostentatious.  Carefully refining a piece of pure Purple Wind Copper to meet Jinyan's requirements was enough.</p><p>After seeing the refined Purple Wind Copper, Jinyan had no hesitation in keeping him.</p><p>The Daoist boy, relieved to have completed his task, hurried back to the mountain, instructing the Avatar to focus on forging the Yin-Yang armor and to avoid disturbing him unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"You already have a foundation in refinement.  Ever considered focusing on it?"</p><p>Jinyan's voice came from behind, but then he shook his head. "Forget I said anything! You were personally introduced by Master Huayang. The Yin-Yang Sect wouldn't allow me to waste your talent; I don't want to invite trouble.  Come with me, I'll introduce you to a fellow disciple.  He will share some materials with you daily. Once you finish your task, you'll have freedom of movement. I won't interfere much!"</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Jinyan!"</p><p>The Avatar thanked him obediently.</p><p>They went deeper into the hall, turning a corner, arriving before a stone chamber. Jinyan left him with a disciple named Gaoyi and departed.</p><p>"Since the Master personally instructed this, Apprentice Brother Zhang, refine this batch of red jade into pendants. After you finish, I'll take you to choose a cave dwelling. We have many unoccupied ones along this cliff."</p><p>Gaoyi led the Avatar to a nearby quiet chamber where a small amount of crimson jade lay. For others, an hour would suffice; for the Avatar, it would be even faster.</p><p>Compared to others' tasks, his was definitely much easier, even Gao Yi looked on with a touch of envy.</p><p>After seeing Gao Yi off and closing the door, the clone, hampered by his low cultivation, finished the task in half an hour.</p><p>But he didn't rush to leave.  The stone hall, though hot, had a rich spiritual energy, so he sat cross-legged in the stone chamber, deciding to attempt refining the Yin-Yang Armor there.</p><p>Refining the Yin-Yang Armor first requires sensing and refining the Yin and Yang energies from the chaotic spiritual energy in the void. This wasn't difficult for the clone; his main body was at the Core Formation stage and was extremely familiar with various refining techniques.</p><p>He pinched a hand seal, and the surrounding spiritual energy suddenly surged and converged.</p><p>Then, a funnel-shaped vortex appeared out of thin air above his head. The vortex spun rapidly, faster and faster.  At that moment, a sudden change occurred, and the vortex exploded with a "bang."</p><p>A stream of light shot out from the clone's energy sea, easily suppressing the chaotic spiritual energy. It was the Sky Eye Butterfly secretly lending a hand.</p><p>The clone chuckled wryly to himself, "This body's cultivation is too weak. It seems I can't achieve it in one go. I'll have to take it slow…"</p><p>After a brief adjustment of his breath, he began to chant the incantation again, but this time much more slowly.</p><p>"Bang! Bang!"</p><p>"Junior Brother Zhang…"</p><p>A knock came on the stone chamber door. The clone awoke from his meditative state, heard Gao Yi's voice, and quickly stopped the incantation.</p><p>He calculated the time – two hours had passed.</p><p>The clone opened his palm, revealing two streams of energy, one black and one white, wriggling like playful fish.</p><p>"It took me two hours of personal cultivation to refine this tiny amount.  If those truly new disciples lack talent, they'll find it hard even to enter the sect, let alone cultivate this technique.  It truly is a Xuanmen secret art…"</p><p>The clone murmured to himself. Suddenly, he clenched his hand, and the Yin and Yang energy in his palm shot into his body. Then, under the clone's deliberate guidance, it quickly flowed upwards along his meridians, entering his Purple Mansion in the blink of an eye.</p>
