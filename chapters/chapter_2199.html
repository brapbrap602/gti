<h1>Chapter 2189: Daojun</h1><p>The immortal child, while not as intimidating to outsiders as it was to the Siyou clan, held immense sway over the clan members.  They dared not defy the ancestor's will and could easily be manipulated into attacking Qin Sang.</p><p>Si Huang and Shao Shi promised non-interference, a result Qin Sang readily accepted.</p><p>Therefore, although Qin Sang initially intended to probe for more information, Shao Shi remained silent, and Qin Sang refrained from further questioning.</p><p>The attitude of Si Huang and Shao Shi confirmed that the attempt to avenge the Grand Protector was the immortal child's initiative, not the Siyou clan ancestor's.</p><p>Where is the immortal child now?</p><p>During the beast tide, no cultivator remained untouched; all participated, yet the child described by Si Lu was absent.  Qin Sang felt no surveillance, unless the child employed superior concealment techniques.</p><p>A silent battlefield remained after the fierce battle. No corpses, not a trace of blood – it felt like a dream.</p><p>After some time, cultivators resumed their cultivation, noticing the delayed arrival of the second wave of the beast tide.</p><p>Someone then proposed sending a group to investigate the edge of the mist.  Several cultivators volunteered and set off.</p><p>Shortly after their departure, more lights streaked across the sky.</p><p>Seeing the lights, everyone rose to greet them, their expressions grave. It seemed that the immediate threat of the beast tide had lessened, replaced by the looming presence of two Saint Realm powerhouses.</p><p>The lights descended, revealing a Zhuo Huai cultivator and Yuan Xiang, the clan leader, and others, all appearing calm and inscrutable.</p><p>Yuan Xiang and the others returned to their respective camps.</p><p>"Elder Brother?" Yuan Ren asked hesitantly.</p><p>Yuan Xiang shook his head gently, gesturing for everyone to listen to the Zhuo Huai cultivator.</p><p>By then, Qin Sang learned the cultivator's name was Hong Yue.</p><p>Hong Yue surveyed the crowd and announced, “You all know the beast tide's origin: the boundless, immortal霞光之海. This is only the beginning; each wave will be more terrifying than the last.  Hong Tian has summoned the leaders of the upper clans to devise a strategy.  The decision is to form a combined array, with the elite of the upper clans at its core, to defend against the tide! However…”</p><p>Hong Yue paused, his tone shifting.  “You're all curious about the depths of the mist.  Let me tell you, this is the former Heart Lake, but not as you knew it.  Consider this the true sacred ground!”</p><p>The crowd frowned. Someone asked, "Daoist Hong Yue, could you be more specific?"</p><p>"I'm not trying to be secretive; I don't fully understand either. I'm only relaying Hong Tian's message…"</p><p>Hong Yue shook his head, then dropped a bombshell.  "The sacred ground's collapse wasn't a test from the ancestors; our ancestors are in trouble!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"What happened to the ancestors?"</p><p>…</p><p>An uproar erupted.</p><p>No one knew how many ancestors were still alive, but all the clan ancestors of the Yi Ren race cultivated in the sacred ground.  Their lifespans were immense; Ancestor Realm cultivators were practically immortal—a substantial number.</p><p>What kind of trouble could bind so many ancestors, even threatening the sacred ground?</p><p>While such speculation existed before, Hong Yue's confirmation brought panic.</p><p>If these ancestors were harmed, it would be a devastating blow to the Yi Ren race!</p><p>"Don't panic. It's not the kind of trouble you imagine.  The situation is under control by the ancestors and Hong Tian; order will be restored soon," Hong Yue reassured them.  "The grey figures born from the霞光, and the beasts they command, are part of the problem. We cannot allow a single grey figure or beast to enter!  Furthermore, the trouble lies within the Heart Lake itself.  Even with our lower cultivation, we can assist the ancestors! You've all received great opportunities from the sacred ground's collapse; it's time to contribute.”</p><p>The cultivators exchanged uneasy glances. Earlier, they had resented the intervention of the two Saint Realm powerhouses. Now, with Hong Tian seemingly allowing them access, they hesitated.</p><p>Hong Yue spoke lightly but never clarified the nature of the trouble. Whatever could bind the clan ancestors would likely obliterate them upon contact.</p><p>Someone tentatively asked, "What can we do for the Patriarch? I heard that Lord Hongtian entered earlier but was forced to retreat."</p><p>"Lord Hongtian's cultivation is too high, causing him to be repelled by an unknown force. Those below the Saint Realm can enter and exit freely.  Moreover, two Lords must personally preside over the great formation to defend against the beast tide," Hongyue's answer was unexpected. He continued, "As for what we can do, it's not yet entirely clear, so we need someone to go to the depths of the Heart Lake."</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone finally understood.  Clearly, Hongtian himself couldn't enter the Heart Lake and was preparing a vanguard.</p><p>Those who had previously been most eager to enter the Heart Lake fell silent.  No one present was a fool; the vanguard would undoubtedly be the most dangerous. Even if the Heart Lake contained many treasures, one had to live to enjoy them.</p><p>Furthermore, don't assume that entering the Heart Lake means escaping control and acting wantonly. Hongtian had entered before, demonstrating that he was merely repelled, not entirely unable to enter.</p><p>For a time, the scene fell silent, with no one volunteering to be in the vanguard.</p><p>Hongyue remained silent, his gaze sweeping across the crowd.</p><p>When Qin Sang met Hongyue's gaze, his heart skipped a beat, a bad feeling arising.</p><p>Sure enough, after a moment, Hongyue sighed softly, saying, "Our foreign guests, please step forward."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  Being in a foreign land and powerless, they could not defy the will of a Saint Realm expert.  Otherwise, Hongyue wouldn't have been so polite.</p><p>He looked at the Yuanxiang Clan Chief and Ji Xia.  Both shook their heads slightly. The Yuanxiang Clan Chief transmitted a message, "This is Lord Hongtian's intention; I am powerless to intervene."</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was settled and flew out of the formation alongside Liuli.</p><p>At this time, two more figures flew out from the right, their妖气 (demon aura) billowing. They were two female demon cultivators, but they did not reveal their true forms, and their origins were unknown.</p><p>The two women looked similar, appearing to be sisters.</p><p>Only four of them stepped forward in the end. The Tianbu tribe and the East Sea aquatic tribe are allies; surely more than two demon cultivators qualified to enter the sacred land, but gaining access requires not only courage and strength, but also surviving the霞光之变 (the Radiant Light Change) and a degree of luck.</p><p>After they stepped forward, Hongyue did not speak, his gaze fixed elsewhere.</p><p>After a moment, a shrill, strange laugh rang out, and a figure leaped out. This person had a bizarre appearance, with one arm and one leg, as if someone had been split in half. He was from the Shenchi tribe, and judging by the ornament on his waist, he was the Shenchi Clan Chief.</p><p>Another Shenchi tribesman, only at the early stage of the Sky Realm (Kongjing) second level, stared at his clan chief in astonishment.</p><p>"I thought my abilities were unmatched, yet I still couldn't escape Lord Hongtian's keen eyes…"</p><p>The Shenchi Clan Chief's voice was completely different, his mouth opening wide to release a dark light.</p><p>The dark light landed, transforming into a monkey-faced monster, only a foot tall, with a gleeful expression.</p><p>"It's... a Soul-Stealing Imp!"</p><p>Someone gasped, recognizing the creature as a notorious demon beast from the East Sea.</p><p>As the name suggests, they can directly seize someone's soul. The victim doesn't die immediately, but becomes dazed and controlled by the Soul-Stealing Imp, undetectable even by their closest relatives.</p><p>With the Soul-Stealing Imp leaving its host, the Shenchi Clan Chief slumped over.</p><p>"Clan Chief!"</p><p>The other Shenchi tribesman cried out, rushing forward to support the clan chief and glaring at the Soul-Stealing Imp.</p><p>"Heh heh, your clan chief isn't dead yet. Don't look at me like that. I didn't intend to occupy this body. I merely reached an agreement with your clan chief. Otherwise, I couldn't have entered the sacred land.  In fact, you should thank me. If I hadn't happened to pass by and save him, your clan chief would have already been killed by his enemies…"</p><p>The Soul-Stealing Imp chuckled, unconcerned. It then bowed to Hongyue, "I merely harbor curiosity about your Yi Ren clan's sacred land, coming to see the sights. I didn't obtain any opportunities and don't wish to know your clan's secrets. Might I ask you to inform Lord Hongtian and grant me leniency? I'm willing to do my utmost to slay demons!"</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>Hongyue nodded.</p><p>The Soul-Stealing Imp was overjoyed; Hongyue was surprisingly agreeable.</p><p>However, Hongyue's tone changed, "In that case, there's no need for you to defend against the beast tide. Leave the Heart Lake immediately."</p><p>The Soul-Stealing Imp's smile immediately vanished.  Everyone knew how dangerous the current Radiant Light Sea was. Leaving now would be no better than being in the vanguard. Even if the passage still existed, he might not survive.</p><p>He looked at Qin Sang and the others, seeing their silence, and sighed, his spirits drooping.</p><p>Five foreign cultivators weren't enough for the vanguard.</p><p>Hongyue spoke again, this time directly naming individuals.  Those chosen were mostly from influential clans, representing various factions.</p><p>Hong Yue looked towards the Zhu Yan tribe, before he could speak, the Yuan Xiang clan leader said, "My clan is not skilled in formations and restrictions. Please leave two You Ming clan friends to assist me.  My seventh brother can go in their stead."</p><p>Hong Yue nodded, "Agreed!"</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang heard a faint, murmuring transmission, "The Immortal Child might be inside!"</p><p>Qin Sang thanked them. By leaving Yuan Jian behind, the Yuan Xiang clan leader prevented Yuan Jian and the Immortal Child from joining forces, giving him a better chance of dealing with the Immortal Child.</p><p>The Yuan Xiang clan leader had previously stated that the Immortal Child and the Zhu Yan tribe had no grievances; they couldn't openly participate in the hunt.  But as long as Yuan Ren was present, even without actively participating, his mere presence would deter them from acting rashly.</p><p>Yuan Ren stepped forward, showing no fear, his expression even hinting at excitement. If the Yuan Xiang clan leader hadn't stopped him, he would have been the first to charge in.</p><p>The other cultivators who were selected didn't share his enthusiasm; some were anxious.</p><p>One cultivator produced a jade token, solemnly stating, "This is a relic left by our ancestor for us. Perhaps our ancestor is waiting for their descendants' assistance. If I die here, how can I account for it to my ancestor?"</p><p>"Someone will account for you! Who among those here doesn't possess an ancestral relic? If you're cowardly and afraid of death, let your ancestor personally explain to Lord Hong Tian!" Hong Yue rebuked him without hesitation.</p><p>The man's face turned pale, frozen in place.</p><p>"Everyone, don't be too pessimistic," Hong Yue changed his tone. "Remember the prophecy? When the sacred ground is destroyed, it will be the day of our clan's revival.  Helping our ancestors solve their problems will surely bring us opportunities. I've said my piece; do as you see fit!"</p><p>He then turned to Qin Sang and the others, "Please, follow me."</p><p>...</p><p>Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>At the lakeside pavilion where Ning Zhenren and Qin Sang had met, two people sat. One was Ning Zhenren.</p><p>Ning Zhenren gently stroked the strings of her guqin, producing celestial music.</p><p>In the seat where Qin Sang had previously sat, an old Daoist was meditating.  Beside him stood a mirror.</p><p>The Daoist was not paying attention to the music, his eyes fixed on the mirror.</p><p>Unfortunately, the mirror showed only a chaotic scene, a jumble of images, nothing clear.</p><p>"It seems that the Great Dream Deity has achieved some understanding in the Dream Path, triggering the upheaval in the sacred ground!"</p><p>The Daoist sighed, his face filled with envy, "The Deity has gathered the power of the entire clan. If they succeed in opening a path in the Dream Path, they might be able to take that next step in the future!"</p><p>Ning Zhenren remained silent, focused on playing her guqin.</p><p>The Daoist, unfazed, continued, "I didn't expect the Deity to attempt a breakthrough now.  With the changes in the sacred ground, I wonder how many of those younger generations will survive. I heard that Ning Shijie sent two in this time?"</p><p>"They were fortunate; they both survived. However, one of them is a chosen one of the Dao Court," Ning Zhenren said calmly, her music flowing smoothly.</p><p>"The Dao Court?"</p><p>The Daoist was startled, "Which Dao Court?"</p><p>Ning Zhenren looked up, her gaze serious, "From ancient times to the present, there has been only one Dao Court."</p><p>The Daoist nodded, "That's true! The Divine Court has already appeared. Regardless of their current identities, these people will always remember the Dao Court. However, the Dao Court only recently returned to the Grand Thousand Worlds, and it's still in its rebuilding phase.  The current Celestial Master hasn't appeared yet.  Perhaps their cultivation is insufficient, and they want to seize the ancestral inheritance?"</p><p>"The Supreme Ancestor, the Daojun who founded the Dao Court, why couldn't they?" Ning Zhenren countered.</p><p>The Daoist's face stiffened. He repeatedly said, "This is unconfirmed, Shijie. You must be careful what you say outside, otherwise, it will cause unnecessary trouble!"</p><p>Ning Zhenren sneered, "It's you stubborn people who refuse to admit that the Ancestor ultimately abandoned the Lesser Vehicle and embraced the Greater Vehicle. You are simply deceiving yourselves and making yourselves look foolish!"</p><p>"There's still no definitive conclusion.  We can't make rash judgments…"</p><p>The Daoist said awkwardly, not wanting to dwell on the topic.</p><p>"The Ancestor left the Spring and Autumn Gnomon for the Great Dream Deity to watch over, but it's not from the Supreme Dao lineage. The Ancestor's intention is clear. Whoever gains the Spring and Autumn Gnomon's acknowledgment will be the Ancestor's successor, regardless of their background," Ning Zhenren declared.</p><p>"Shijie is right, but they still have to be from the Daoist sect; otherwise, how will they gain the recognition of the various lineages? Oh well, at least the Dao Court's successor is from our Daoist sect…"</p><p>The Daoist didn't insist further, partly because he didn't believe the Dao Court would send just anyone to obtain the inheritance.</p><p>The various lineages of the Supreme Dao Sect and the Great Dream Deity had a long-standing agreement. Countless disciples had been sent over the years, yet none had been able to take the Spring and Autumn Gnomon.</p><p>"The other one is the disciple you chose, Shijie? After all these years, you've finally taken on a disciple again.  But I have one question, Shijie. Why did you send your disciple to the Supreme Impartial Path?"</p>
