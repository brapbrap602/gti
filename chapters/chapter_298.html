<h1>Chapter 291: Annihilation</h1><p>In the depths of the abyss, two "elderly" hook serpents were sleeping soundly. Suddenly awakened by the bloody aura, they quickly blocked their path.</p><p>The bodies of these two hook serpents were much larger than those in the red mist, measuring up to several dozen feet long. Their scales were as black as ink, and each scale was exceptionally thick, with an iridescent glow flowing between them like a dragon.</p><p>Snake heads emerged from the abyss, and four scarlet giant eyes fixed onto Luo Xingnan and the others. A large portion of their bodies was still hidden in the gloomy miasma, and their snake tails stirred up the miasma, causing a violent wind and waves.</p><p>Upon seeing these roadblocks, Luo Xingnan and the others' hearts sank, their complexions changed.</p><p>Mid-stage demon spirit!</p><p>Originally, even when being hunted by the hook serpents, the crowd had not been too flustered. Even if they couldn't defeat them, it wasn't difficult to escape. As long as they returned to the cave, they could rely on the terrain and the possibility of Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi counterattacking the hook serpents was not small.</p><p>But now, no one dared to have such an idea anymore, a group of hook serpents had fallen into a frenzy, and there were at least two mid-stage demon spirit great demons among them. Their strength had already surpassed them.</p><p>"Hurry up and go!"</p><p>Someone shouted loudly.</p><p>The group of people didn't dare to hesitate in the slightest and tried to rush out of the encirclement.</p><p>But the speed of the hook serpents was faster.</p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p>Two huge snake mouths opened at the same time, and two groups of dark red mist, even slightly tinged with black, spewed out from their mouths. In an instant, it spread out, becoming a huge red wall, and rushed towards them at an astonishing speed.</p><p>At the same time, from the abyss, two black shadows suddenly flashed out, and the snake tails sprang out from the abyss with great flexibility, transforming into huge whips, and they lashed over fiercely.</p><p>The strong wind was blowing towards them.</p><p>Luckily, Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi had absolute control over their subordinates, and the formation had not been broken. Upon seeing this, they immediately ordered the group to form up in order to resist.</p><p>"Form up!"</p><p>Following Luo Xingnan's loud shout, the spiritual power on the crowd's bodies increased greatly, forming into a huge light shield in front of them.</p><p>Consequently, the speed of their escape had to be reduced, but this was a helpless matter.</p><p>The mid-stage demon spirit demonic beast and Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi were on the same level, and at a glance, it could be seen that the demon bodies of these two hook serpents were very strong, and their tail hooks would definitely carry strong poison.</p><p>They didn't dare to use their bodies to resist the snake tails.</p><p>The red mist struck, and a teeth-grinding "chi chi" sound rang out from the light shield. This red mist could actually corrode the light shield, which showed how strong its toxicity was. Luckily, it was firmly blocked outside the light shield and couldn't enter.</p><p>But the snake tails that came close behind weren't that easy to resist.</p><p>Because of the fork, there were actually four snake tails that attacked, and they attacked almost at the same time, hitting the light shield hard.</p><p>KABOOM!</p><p>The light shield trembled violently, and the complexions of everyone slightly whitened as they were shocked by the great strength of the hook serpents.</p><p>The tail hook on the snake's tail carried a horrifying cold light, and it almost pierced through the light shield. Luckily, the light shield was strong enough that it wasn't pierced through. However, the tail hook that was close, still startled the two people in the front of the formation until they broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>"Imprison!"</p><p>Before the others had caught their breath, they heard Luo Xingnan and the other two shout loudly. They hurriedly urged the spiritual power again, and the light shield in front immediately dissolved, transforming into innumerable light ropes. Like tentacles, they wrapped around the snake tails of the hook serpents.</p><p>These light ropes were very tough and firmly imprisoned the snake tails. The hook serpents struggled violently, and countless light ropes snapped, but they still weren't able to break free for a while.</p><p>"ROAR!"</p><p>The hook serpents roared angrily, and they abandoned their snake tails and attacked with their heads.</p><p>But compared to their tails, snake heads were far from being that flexible. Although the red mist was venomous, it needed some time to corrode and penetrate the crowd's protective spiritual power.</p><p>"Hurry up and go!"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi shouted loudly.</p><p>―――――</p><p>Opportunities were fleeting.</p><p>They didn't need Sheng Yuanzi to remind them. The others also understood the urgency of the situation. The hook serpents behind them also had fallen into a frenzy, and they were already within reach. If they couldn't escape from the encirclement soon, they would have nowhere to run but to their deaths.</p><p>The situation was pressing, and the crowd displayed their various means. Their escape light was like lightning.</p><p>At this moment, the figure of Yu Kong, who was hiding in the dark, moved slightly.</p><p>At the same time, Yu Kong's voice transmission reached Qin Sang's ears. But before he could respond, he heard Yu Kong's anxious low shout again. He gave an order which contradicted his previous one.</p><p>"Don't move!"</p><p>Before his voice had faded, one angry and surprised voice after another could be heard from the distant battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang also saw it following closely behind.</p><p>In the midst of the red mist, there was suddenly a hook serpent that had gone ahead of all the others. Its size was comparable to the two that were sleeping in the abyss!</p><p>They didn't discover its presence until it rushed out of the red mist.</p><p>In the mountains near the precipice where two hook snakes slumber, there suddenly appeared a "young" hook snake at mid-level demon spirit period.</p><p>Three hook snakes of mid-level demon spirit period!</p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p>A long snake tail spun out a hurricane and enveloped the humans with its shadow.</p><p>Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi were the fastest to escape, but also the largest targets. They were unprepared for the sudden appearance of the hook snake and were forced to retreat. The others were obviously in a sorry state. The whole situation soon descended into chaos.</p><p>Before the people could steady themselves, the two other hook snakes also broke free from the light shackles. The three powerful demon beasts spread out their long bodies in the sky, forming a defensive cordon that surrounded the people like an iron bucket. They eyed the people hungrily.</p><p>The chance to flee was lost in a flash, and the people clearly had not been able to grasp it.</p><p>The next moment, red fog suddenly spread out.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Fighting immediately broke out. Red fog rolled and snake shadows danced about, and it was almost impossible to see the human cultivators clearly.</p><p>The roars of the cultivators and the hissing of the hook snakes could be heard at the same time, but it was impossible to tell them apart.</p><p>Not long after, one of the cultivators barely managed to reach the edge of the red fog, but was then stabbed in the chest by a hook-shaped tail from behind. With a scream, his body was torn into pieces and collected by separate tails.</p><p>There were just three mid-level demon spirit period hook snakes, but countless were at the initial stage. And there were only two human cultivators of mid-level foundation building period: Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>The even more terrifying truth was that the hook snakes had all been driven insane by the smell of blood and were utterly fearless of death.</p><p>When a human cultivator died, their body would be torn apart by the hook snakes. It had become impossible to know how many people had died inside.</p><p>The hook snakes that were killed by the attacking cultivators were also quite numerous. Every once in a while, the body of a hook snake would fall, its body equally mutilated. Driven to frenzy, the hook snakes were not even sparing their own kind.</p><p>By this point, the stench of blood had reached an almost unbearable level, and the hook snakes had become even more ferocious.</p><p>Red fog filled the air, making it impossible to see the battle going on, but until now, no one had managed to break out of the encirclement. The cries of anguish rose and fell, making the listeners' hearts tremble.</p><p>Could it be that everyone was going to die here?</p><p>Yu Kong and the others, who were watching from a safe distance, were beginning to feel a little scared.</p><p>Yu Kong also had not expected that there would be so many mid-level demon spirit period hook snakes in hiding here. After a moment's deliberation, he cautiously stood up from his hiding place.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>After hearing Yu Kong's transmitted message, Qin Sang stood up lightly and followed Yu Kong in a large circle as they headed toward the opposite bank of the precipice, taking advantage of the fact that the hook snakes were all distracted by Luo Xingnan and the others.</p><p>In the abyss, two 'ancient' Hook Serpents, roused from their slumber by the scent of blood, blocked the path of the fleeing cultivators.  These serpents were far larger than those encountered in the red mist, each tens of meters long.  Their scales, as black as ink, were thick and heavy, with a strange luminescence shimmering between them, giving them the appearance of nascent dragons.  Their heads emerged from the abyss, four crimson eyes fixed on Luo Xingnan and his companions.  Most of their bodies remained hidden in the shadowy depths, their tails churning the gloom, stirring up phantom winds and waves.</p><p>The sight of these two behemoths made Luo Xingnan and the others' hearts sink. Their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Spirit Severing Middle Stage!</p><p>Initially, pursued by the Hook Serpents, the group hadn't panicked. Even if they couldn't win, escape seemed feasible.  Returning to the cave, they could rely on the terrain, and with the combined strength of Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, two powerful cultivators, they even held out hope of turning the tables.</p><p>Now, such thoughts vanished.  A pack of frenzied Hook Serpents, including at least two powerful Spirit Severing Middle Stage demons, clearly outmatched them.</p><p>"Run!" someone yelled.</p><p>Without hesitation, the group attempted to break through the encirclement.</p><p>But the Hook Serpents were faster.</p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p>Two massive maws opened simultaneously, spewing deep crimson, almost black mist. The mist spread rapidly, forming a massive red wall that rushed toward them with alarming speed.</p><p>Simultaneously, two dark figures flashed from the abyss.  Their tails, incredibly flexible, shot out like enormous whips.</p><p>The force of the wind buffeted their faces.</p><p>Fortunately, Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi maintained absolute control over their subordinates. The formation held.  They immediately ordered everyone to form a defensive formation.</p><p>"Form up!" Luo Xingnan roared.</p><p>Spiritual energy surged from the cultivators, coalescing into a massive shield of light in front of them.</p><p>This slowed their escape, but it was unavoidable.</p><p>Spirit Severing Middle Stage demons were on par with Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.  Moreover, the robust bodies of these two Hook Serpents suggested immense physical power, and their tail hooks were undoubtedly venomous.</p><p>They dared not risk direct contact with the tails.</p><p>As the red mist struck the light shield, a grating sound filled the air.  The mist was corrosive, its toxicity evident. Thankfully, the shield held, preventing the mist from penetrating.</p><p>The serpent tails, however, were a different matter.</p><p>Due to the bifurcated tails, four whip-like appendages lashed out almost simultaneously, striking the light shield with tremendous force.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The shield trembled violently, and the cultivators paled, shocked by the raw power of the Hook Serpents.</p><p>The gleaming hooks on the tails nearly pierced through the shield. Though the shield held, the close call sent shivers down the spines of those at the front of the formation.</p><p>"Bind!"</p><p>While still shaken, they heard Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi's commands.  They immediately channeled their spiritual energy again.  The light shield dissolved, transforming into countless glowing tendrils that lashed out like tentacles, ensnaring the serpents' tails.</p><p>These tendrils were incredibly strong, firmly binding the tails.  The Hook Serpents struggled fiercely, snapping many tendrils, but for a moment, they were held fast.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Hook Serpents roared, abandoning their tails and lunging forward with their heads.</p><p>Compared to their tails, their heads were less agile. Though the red mist was poisonous, it needed time to corrode and penetrate the cultivators' protective spiritual energy.</p><p>"Go!" Sheng Yuanzi yelled.</p><p>―――――</p><p>The window of opportunity was fleeting.</p><p>Even without Sheng Yuanzi's reminder, everyone understood the urgency.  The pursuing Hook Serpents were closing in, and if they didn't escape quickly, they were doomed.</p><p>In the desperate situation, each cultivator used their own methods, their escape lights flashing like lightning.</p><p>At that moment, Yu Kong, hidden in the shadows, stirred.</p><p>Qin Sang heard Yu Kong's voice transmission, but before he could respond, Yu Kong barked a contradictory command.</p><p>"Don't move!"</p><p>Before the words faded, cries of alarm erupted from the distant battlefield.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang saw it too.</p><p>Amidst the swirling red mist, a Hook Serpent suddenly emerged, its size rivaling the two slumbering in the abyss!</p><p>Only when it broke free of the mist did they realize its presence.</p><p>Besides the two in the abyss, there was a 'younger' Hook Serpent hidden among the low hills, also at the Spirit Severing Middle Stage.</p><p>Three Spirit Severing Middle Stage Hook Serpents!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A long tail whipped up a hurricane, encircling them.  The shadows cast by the serpents blotted out the sky.</p><p>Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, having fled the furthest, were the biggest targets.  The sudden appearance of the third Hook Serpent forced them back, leaving them in disarray. The others fared even worse, the situation descending into chaos.</p><p>Before they could recover, the other two Hook Serpents broke free of the light tendrils. The three powerful demons uncoiled their long bodies, hovering in the air, forming an impenetrable circle around the cultivators, their eyes gleaming with predatory intent.</p><p>The chance to escape was gone.</p><p>The next moment, the red mist surged forward.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The battle erupted. Red mist billowed, serpent shadows writhed, and the cultivators were barely visible.</p><p>Cries of rage and the hissing of the Hook Serpents mingled in a cacophony of sound.</p><p>Soon, a cultivator struggled to the edge of the red mist, only to be impaled from behind by a tail hook. With a scream, the cultivator was torn apart, limbs and torso dangling from the retracting hooks.</p><p>Three Spirit Severing Middle Stage Hook Serpents, countless Spirit Severing Early Stage ones, against only two Foundation Establishment Middle Stage cultivators, Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>Even more terrifying, driven by the bloodlust, the Hook Serpents fought with reckless abandon.</p><p>Each dead cultivator was dismembered, making it impossible to tell how many had fallen.</p><p>The cultivators also managed to kill several Hook Serpents.  Mutilated serpent corpses rained down, victims of the frenzied Hook Serpents who attacked even their own kind.</p><p>The stench of blood was now overpowering, further inflaming the serpents' ferocity.</p><p>The red mist obscured the battle, but no one had managed to break through. The screams continued, chilling to the bone.</p><p>Would everyone perish here?</p><p>Even Yu Kong and the others, watching from afar, were horrified.</p><p>Yu Kong hadn't expected so many Spirit Severing Middle Stage Hook Serpents.  After a moment of contemplation, he quietly rose from his hiding place.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Upon hearing Yu Kong's transmission, Qin Sang rose and followed, taking a wide detour around the battle, slipping towards the opposite side of the abyss while the Hook Serpents were occupied with Luo Xingnan and the others.</p>
