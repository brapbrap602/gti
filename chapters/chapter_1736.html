<h1>Chapter 1727: Eastward Bound</h1><p>Great Compassion Zen Temple's secluded courtyard.</p><p>This temple, built near the uninhabited zone bordering the Storm Belt, served to protect a sacred Dao Field, the tribulation-crossing grounds of Great Compassion Zen Temple's past generations of eminent monks.</p><p>Outside the temple, yellow sand billowed relentlessly.</p><p>On this day, two figures emerged from the desert's depths. One wore monastic robes, the other a Daoist gown.</p><p>Their movements indicated they weren't flying with spiritual energy, but walking upon the ground. Yet their speed was astonishing, their feet leaving no trace in the dust. Had mortals witnessed them, they would have surely mistaken them for apparitions.</p><p>The arrivals were none other than Qin Sang and Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely, eyes closed, a faint golden aura shimmering around his body. His agitated vital energy suggested he was suppressing something within.</p><p>After three years of training in the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern, Qin Sang had absorbed Radiant Gold Sword Energy into his body.</p><p>He was already a Nascent Soul cultivator and had once used the Yin Fire Tribulation to shatter and rebuild himself, enduring pain beyond mortal comprehension.</p><p>Not only did he allow the Radiant Gold Sword Energy to enter his body, but after adapting, he actively channeled his True Essence to attract even more.  Striving for optimal cultivation results, Qin Sang constantly pushed himself to the brink of physical collapse, enduring unimaginable agony to purify his meridians and marrow.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, occasionally checking on him in the cavern, expressed immense admiration.</p><p>The benefits of training in the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern weren't always immediately apparent.  Over time, the Radiant Gold Energy would accumulate within the body, requiring further refinement.</p><p>This refinement process also strengthened the physical body, a benefit Qin Sang would experience later in his cultivation.</p><p>He pushed himself so hard to absorb as much Radiant Gold Energy as possible. Three years of arduous cultivation had brought Qin Sang's body close to its limit.  The accumulated Radiant Gold Energy was the source of his restless vital energy.</p><p>Qin Sang used his True Essence to quell the turbulence.</p><p>Looking inward, he circulated his True Essence ceaselessly.</p><p>With each cycle, his vital energy calmed further.</p><p>By the time the Great Compassion Zen Temple's secluded courtyard came into view, Qin Sang had returned to normal, the image of a transcendent Daoist once more.</p><p>Only a few monks resided in the courtyard now, all eminent monks of the Great Compassion Zen Temple, who had arrived early to protect Master Zhitan during his tribulation.</p><p>Entering the temple, they didn't see Master Zhitan.  He was scheduled to emerge from seclusion three days later, and upon emerging, he would immediately attempt to break through!</p><p>Master Huaiyin led Qin Sang to a quiet chamber and left for a short while, returning with a scroll.</p><p>The scroll was slender and felt soft in his hands.</p><p>It was the Great Compassion Zen Temple's tribulation-crossing secret treasure: the Myriad Kings Diagram!</p><p>Qin Sang slowly unfurled the scroll, revealing a material akin to the finest silk, thin as a cicada's wing.  The base color was slightly yellowed, yet the pigments on the painting remained vibrant and fresh.</p><p>The Myriad Kings Diagram depicted one of the legendary dharma forms of Acala, the Immovable Wisdom King.</p><p>The dharma form sat upon a stone pedestal, in the form of a child.  Seven knots adorned its head, braided hair draped over its left shoulder.  Its left eye was slightly closed, lower teeth biting its upper lip in a wrathful expression.  Engulfed in fierce flames, it held a sharp sword in its right hand and a lasso in its left, poised to sever all worldly attachments.</p><p>The depicted dharma form was incredibly lifelike, radiating the aura of a true Wisdom King. It was difficult to look directly at it, and demons would instinctively recoil in fear upon seeing it.</p><p>Master Huaiyin pressed his palms together, knelt before the Acala dharma form, and began chanting.</p><p>He wasn't reciting ordinary scriptures but a secret mantra to activate the Myriad Kings Diagram, profound and boundless.</p><p>Although not a Buddhist, Qin Sang's original body had studied Buddhist Dharma in the Western Desert. His avatar had also spent considerable time in the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery's scripture library. Furthermore, this mantra was a method of application, not difficult to comprehend.</p><p>Understanding the mantra made its application even simpler. Qin Sang needed only to fully activate the Myriad Kings Diagram, unleashing the extraordinary power contained within the Acala image, and precisely time its empowerment of Master Zhitan. Three days were sufficient for him to master this treasure.</p><p>He memorized the mantra carefully, extended his divine sense into the Myriad Kings Diagram, and immersed himself in contemplation.</p><p>Master Huaiyin quietly withdrew.</p><p>Qin Sang remained within the quiet chamber for three days.</p><p>Master Xingji visited on the second day but didn't disturb him.</p><p>Until the morning of Master Zhitan's emergence from seclusion.</p><p>The monks waited outside Qin Sang's chamber. With a creak, the door opened, and Qin Sang stepped out. He nodded to Master Xingji and addressed Master Huaiyin, "This humble Daoist can now skillfully wield the Myriad Kings Diagram. Where does Master Zhitan intend to undergo his tribulation?"</p><p>Master Huaiyin bowed, "Please, True Monarch, grace the rear mountain with your presence."</p><p>The so-called rear mountain was once a sand dune.  Through powerful Dharma, the monks of Great Compassion Zen Temple had solidified the sand into stone, and over generations, they had channeled moisture to artificially create a verdant mountain.</p><p>The rear mountain wasn't large, consisting of three peaks.</p><p>The monks and Qin Sang landed on the leftmost peak, gazing towards the central main peak.</p><p>Upon arrival, Qin Sang sensed something unusual, his voice grave, "Master Zhitan has already begun his breakthrough attempt."</p><p>Master Huaiyin and the others, still unaware, tensed at his words, their eyes fixed on the main peak.</p><p>If the breakthrough failed, there would be no need for Qin Sang's intervention, and he would have benefited without effort.</p><p>In the two hundred years since True Monarch Zilei's fall, besides Qin Sang, no one, at least not openly, had successfully broken through to the Nascent Soul realm and triggered the Nascent Soul Tribulation, in either the Western Lands or the Central Continent.</p><p>True Monarch Zilei, unaware of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, had faced his tribulation unprepared. Now, Master Zhitan had made extensive preparations and invited a Nascent Soul cultivator for protection.  If he succeeded in breaking through and attracting the Heavenly Tribulation, the potency of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound could be tested.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>At midday, the sky abruptly darkened.</p><p>A violent wind swept through the void.</p><p>Sandstorms raged outside the mountain, engulfing the temple in a swirling yellow haze, plunging the world into twilight.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others watched the main peak intently.  Above it, wind and clouds churned, and spiritual energy surged, forming a visible vortex in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.  Judging by this spectacle, Master Zhitan had a reasonable chance of success.  He had patiently accumulated power for his tribulation, and this profound accumulation was now manifesting dramatically.</p><p>A successful breakthrough didn't guarantee ascension to Nascent Soul.</p><p>Even before the appearance of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, countless powerful cultivators had perished during the Nascent Soul Tribulation.  Not everyone could traverse the Yin Fire, Yin Wind, and Heart Demon Tribulations with the ease of Qin Sang.</p><p>But those who reached this stage were all exceptionally gifted!</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, sitting cross-legged on a rock, the Myriad Kings Diagram spread across his knees.</p><p>Observing him, Master Xingji led several monks to the other peak, while Master Huaiyin stood beside Qin Sang.</p><p>As the dominant force in the Western Lands, the Great Compassion Zen Temple was unlikely to face interference during Master Zhitan's tribulation, especially with Nascent Soul True Monarch Qin Sang present.  So many protectors weren't strictly necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, perceiving the world through his divine sense, while another part of his mind connected with the Myriad Kings Diagram.</p><p>Soon, he stirred, a thought arising: "The breakthrough is successful!"</p><p>Simultaneously, the spiritual tide atop the main peak intensified dramatically, filling the surrounding monks with primal fear. The scene at the vortex's center distorted as the Yin Fire Tribulation descended!</p><p>The monks still couldn't see Master Zhitan but sensed the Yin Fire's fluctuations.</p><p>The Yin Fire Tribulation was the weakest of the Nascent Soul Heavenly Tribulations.  Cultivators capable of attempting Nascent Soul ascension wouldn't be defeated by the Yin Fire.</p><p>The monks' attention now shifted from the main peak to Qin Sang.</p><p>Shortly after, Buddhist light radiated from above the rock where Qin Sang sat. The scroll rose into the air and unfurled, revealing the image of Acala.</p><p>The Myriad Kings Diagram vanished within the Buddhist light, leaving only the image, as if stepping out of the painting into reality, a true Acala, facing the main peak, its gaze fixed on the one undergoing tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang sat behind the Acala image, forming Buddhist hand seals and chanting the secret mantra. It sounded identical to Master Huaiyin's chanting, yet possessed a unique rhythm.</p><p>Empowered by the mantra, the flames behind Acala intensified, engulfing Qin Sang, forcing Master Huaiyin to retreat several zhang.</p><p>The Yin Fire Tribulation reached its peak and began to wane.</p><p>The instant the Yin Fire vanished completely, Qin Sang finished the mantra, letting out a low shout as he opened his eyes, his expression wrathful, mirroring the Acala before him.</p><p>For an instant, man and dharma form became one.</p><p>Acala raised its sword, pointing towards the main peak. A golden beam shot forth.</p><p>Upon leaving the image, all divine power dissipated.  The Acala image shattered, reverting to the Myriad Kings Diagram, its light dimmed as it fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>The others only saw the golden beam fly towards the main peak. Qin Sang clearly saw it strike Master Zhitan's forehead, dyeing his white eyebrows and beard gold.</p><p>Unseen by Qin Sang, within Master Zhitan's spiritual platform and Purple Mansion, his nascent soul donned a golden suit of armor.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Yin Wind appeared!</p><p>Qin Sang caught the Myriad Kings Diagram, tossed it to Master Huaiyin, and kept his eyes on the main peak. Confirming the tribulation hadn't spread, he silently circulated his cultivation technique to recover, waiting to see the outcome of the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang lacked precise knowledge of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound's power, having never experienced it personally.  He could only estimate its approximate range.</p><p>Extraordinary phenomena continued on the main peak.</p><p>After the Yin Wind Tribulation, dark clouds gathered, and heavenly lightning descended.</p><p>Booming thunder shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>Bolts of tribulation lightning rained down on the main peak.  Amidst the dazzling light, occasional flashes of treasure light and sounds of shattering indicated the destruction of formations and magical treasures.</p><p>Most prominent was a black ruyi scepter.</p><p>Initially appearing sporadically, during the later stages of the lightning tribulation, Master Zhitan focused on wielding the black ruyi.  Like a black dragon, it soared and swooped, devouring lightning bolts above and shielding its master below.</p><p>The terrifying lightning made the monks' eyelids twitch.  They couldn't discern Master Zhitan's condition, but judging by the black ruyi's fluctuating light, it wasn't easy.</p><p>As their anxiety peaked, the tribulation clouds birthed the final lightning bolt, hurtling towards the main peak, accompanied by a torrent of spiritual energy.</p><p>Atop the main peak, a stick of incense had appeared beside Master Zhitan.  As the lightning and spiritual energy washed over him, he maintained a solemn expression, flicking his sleeve to light the incense.</p><p>The fragrance cleared his mind.</p><p>Simultaneously, Master Zhitan finally 'heard' the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, Master Huaiyin, and Master Xingji on the opposite peak flew towards the main peak, witnessing the remnants of the tribulation formation and the old monk seated within.</p><p>Suddenly, Master Xingji sighed towards the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang heard his mournful voice transmission, "Master Zhitan was too engrossed in his breakthrough technique."</p><p>Master Zhitan was now laughing and crying, alternating between uproarious laughter and mournful sobs, occasionally displaying lewd gestures.  All seven emotions and six desires manifested, as he rapidly experienced countless heart demon illusions.  Whether laughing or crying, his expression grew increasingly crazed!</p><p>This outward manifestation of the heart demon signified his doom.</p><p>The Soul Calming Incense burned beside him, its fragrance wafting, yet it couldn't pull Master Zhitan from the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. He had heard of True Monarch Zilei's struggles, managing a flicker of clarity in his final moments. Master Zhitan's performance was even worse.</p><p>The Soul Calming Incense wasn't entirely ineffective. Their experiences, temperaments, and Dharma tools differed. Without the incense, Master Zhitan's state would have been even more dire.</p><p>Master Xingji's assessment was accurate. Master Zhitan had spent three hundred years simply accumulating power, and the prior preparation time was unknown.  His obsession with this technique had left him no way back.</p><p>Exchanging glances, Qin Sang and Master Xingji quietly withdrew from the rear mountain, sparing themselves the sight of Master Zhitan's chaotic emotions and desires, preserving the Great Compassion Zen Temple's dignity.</p><p>The monks encircled the main peak, grief etched on their faces.</p><p>The next day, Qin Sang felt his quiet chamber's restriction being touched. Opening the door, he saw Master Huaiyin standing outside, his composure restored.  He bowed deeply, "This humble monk, on behalf of the abbot, thanks True Monarch for your protection."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "There's no need for such formalities, Master. Master Zhitan knowingly pursued a doomed path. This humble Daoist admires his resolve. Please accept my condolences."</p><p>Master Zhitan had left instructions for a simple ceremony should he fail.  Having perished in the Heart Demon Tribulation, his body remained intact.  The monks prepared his funeral rites, cremating his body and enshrining his relics.</p><p>Qin Sang remained until the completion of the transcendence ceremony before taking his leave.</p><p>He departed with Master Xingji.</p><p>After Master Zhitan's fall, including Master Huaiyin, the monks' gazes towards Qin Sang held a newfound reverence. They couldn't understand whether the Superior Soul Calming Incense was vastly superior to the regular version or if this True Monarch Qin possessed such impeccable temperament.</p><p>Qin Sang himself pondered the question. Witnessing the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound's power firsthand revealed the tribulation's terrifying nature.  Could the Superior Soul Calming Incense truly be effective?</p><p>Regardless, refining the Superior Soul Calming Incense was imperative.  They possessed three medicinal embryos; after refinement, they could test its efficacy.</p><p>Returning to the Central Continent, Master Xingji invited Qin Sang to the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, but Qin Sang declined.</p><p>The Western Lands were but one region.  The vast Canglang Sea and the North Sea awaited, and time was precious.</p><p>Having made the necessary arrangements, he didn't even return to Deer Field, crossing the East Sea directly, entering the Storm Belt from its eastern edge.</p><p>He planned to visit the Canglang Sea first.</p><p>Before leaving the North Sea, he had instructed them to continue searching for the Ascension Platform, though not with the full force of the Central Continent or Western Lands.</p><p>Traversing the Storm Belt as a Nascent Soul cultivator was drastically different from his Yuan Ying experience.</p><p>He could now manipulate the power of heaven and earth, directly absorbing the chaotic spiritual energy within the Storm Belt. While not as efficient as within the cultivation world, it replenished his consumption, allowing him to endure longer journeys without borrowing the Ten Directions World Cleaving Shuttle from Liu Li.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush, flying at a measured pace, utilizing the time to comprehend various divine abilities and secret techniques.</p><p>Refining the Radiant Gold Energy within his body was a priority.  He also discovered that the "Inner Lion Seal" and the "Seven Masters Buddha Seal," both Buddhist seals, complemented each other well in cultivation.</p><p>He occasionally summoned the Grey Warbler Sword, practicing the "Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation."</p><p>The poison pearl within him continuously devoured the poisonous fumes.</p><p>His strength gradually increased on his long journey.</p><p>Perhaps through good fortune, Qin Sang encountered no ferocious beasts during his nearly twenty years traversing the Storm Belt.</p><p></p>
