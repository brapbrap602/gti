<h1>Chapter 245: Lend a Helping Hand</h1><p>Old Man Earth-Fiend chuckled, "How could I bear to abandon them? Many years ago, that old celestial doctor, Tian Yi, blocked my gate and borrowed them. I owe him a favor, so I couldn’t refuse. Later, Tian Yi entrusted his disciple to search for treasure, but not only did that disciple lose his life, he also lost my treasures. I went to the mine myself once, but it was a shame that the barrier of the mine was destroyed, which allowed demonic cloud beasts to nest there. I thought the little things couldn't have survived, but I never expected them to end up in the hands of Little Brother."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed after hearing that.</p><p>Before he entered the ancient cultivator's legacies, he specifically asked Mu Yifeng about the names of several Foundation Establishment cultivators. After confirming that Tian Yi wasn't among them, he daringly released the Fire Jade Centipede to search for treasure.</p><p>Who would have thought that Tian Yi wasn't the master of the Fire Jade Centipede, but had borrowed it from Old Man Earth-Fiend?</p><p>Ordinary people were lucky to obtain one of these strange insects, yet Old Man Earth-Fiend had a pair.</p><p>Tian Yi was the one who'd commissioned Yin Xingge to mine Sun Essence Crystals. He was the deputy sect master of the Medicine King Sect. Although Yin Xingge wasn't Tian Yi's personal disciple, he was still held in high regard.</p><p>Qin Sang had made a point of looking into this after he left the mine.</p><p>Naturally, his plan was to find an opportunity to go to the mine after the news had died down. He would then use the Fire Jade Centipede to locate the Sun Essence Crystal and make a fortune.</p><p>Yin Xingge had bad luck. He hadn't even found the Sun Essence Crystal before being attacked by the humanoid cloud beast. Such a thing wasn’t common.</p><p>However, before Qin Sang could act, he learned that an expert who'd entered the mine had found the Sun Essence Crystal. However, when they were collecting it, they were attacked by a humanoid cloud beast with the strength of a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>After a great battle, although the humanoid cloud beast was killed, the barrier outside the mine was accidentally destroyed. This completely exposed the mine to the cloud beasts in the rift valley, and it became a lair for the cloud beasts.</p><p>Now, if anyone dared to enter the mine to excavate it, they would only meet one end: being torn into pieces by the cloud beasts.</p><p>That matter was thereby dropped.</p><p>"The place where Tian Yi's disciple died isn't somewhere that just anyone can enter. Since Little Brother picked up the little things, how could you not know who dropped them? That treasure of mine isn't something that boy would dare to throw away haphazardly. Could it be that it has fallen into Little Brother's hands?"</p><p>Old Man Earth-Fiend narrowed his eyes, and a glint of light flashed across them.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression stiffened, and he hurriedly defended himself, "Senior is wise. You must be referring to Senior Brother Yin Xingge. Back then, I was one of the shadow guards who entered the mine. Later, Senior Brother Yin left the team without permission, and he awakened the humanoid cloud beasts, which caused all this trouble. In order to find Senior Brother Yin, we nearly died at the hands of the cloud beasts. I discovered this centipede by chance, and I later learned that it was the strange insect, Fire Jade Centipede. It isn't..."</p><p>"Alright, alright..."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish speaking, Old Man Earth-Fiend impatiently waved his hand, "I'm not his master. Whether he died at the hands of the cloud beasts or at the hands of someone else has nothing to do with this old man! You don't have to be nervous either. I remember that you're a disciple of Mount Shaohua. Carrion Devil is nearby, so I wouldn't dare to do anything to you. What's more, it was thanks to you that the little things have been recovered. Even if you didn't contribute much, you still underwent hardship. This old man should properly thank you..."</p><p>Although he said this, Qin Sang couldn't relax in the slightest because, even now, Old Man Earth-Fiend hadn't lifted the restriction on his body!</p><p>Qin Sang smiled on his face, "Since the Fire Jade Centipede belongs to Senior, then it should be returned to its rightful owner. I don't dare to take credit for it. Please release me, Senior. I'll leave and won't bother you any longer."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang glanced down at his stiff body.</p><p>"Not so fast!"</p><p>Old Man Earth-Fiend turned a blind eye to Qin Sang's little movements. He walked past Qin Sang and down the stone steps. As he walked, he said, "That illusion array outside is rather interesting. If it weren't for these two little things, even I wouldn't have been able to notice anything unusual. What's hidden there must be extraordinary. Let this old man see what kind of surprises these little things can give me again...huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't move and couldn't see Old Man Earth-Fiend's expression. However, judging from his tone of voice, it seemed as though he recognized the vine and fruit in the lake.</p><p>When Old Man Earth-Fiend suddenly saw the strange vine and fruit, he was somewhat surprised. His expression suddenly changed slightly, and he muttered, "Golden fruit. This...could this be the Scarlet Gold Vine?"</p><p>Surprise appeared on his face as he turned his gaze to the Flame Flying Monkey. He pondered for a moment, then turned to look at Qin Sang. He laughed and said, "Little Brother, you truly are a lucky star! I racked my brains and even broke through several difficult barriers, but I only found a few worthless items.</p><p>I just met with you, little brother, and not only did I regain the Fire Jade Centipede, but I've also just seen the Crimson Gold Vine. I really didn't have to do anything to get it!"</p><p>Crimson Gold Vine?</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and confirmed that he had never heard of the Crimson Gold Vine before.</p><p>But judging by Elder Di Que's unconcealed delight, the Crimson Gold Vine must be very precious.</p><p>What a pity!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed to himself. He suddenly felt the 禁制 curse on his body being lifted. He turned and saw Elder Di Que looking at him with piercing eyes. He asked, "What is your name, little brother?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. "Reporting to senior, my surname is Qin."</p><p>"Brother Qin..."</p><p>Elder Di Que nodded. He suddenly spoke in a friendly manner, "Brother Qin, you've helped this old man so much. This old man is very grateful to you! I just don't know how to thank you."</p><p>Stared at by Elder Di Que's triangular eyes, Qin Sang felt his heart skip a beat and grow anxious. He quickly bowed and said, "Senior, you're too kind. This junior only helped out by chance. It's nothing worth rewarding."</p><p>"Brother Qin is being too humble. This old man is not an ungrateful person. I still have to acknowledge you for this favor. However, this is not the place to discuss it. This old man happens to have a small matter. How about Brother Qin helps this old man to the end? After we leave this place, this old man will thank you properly. What do you think?"</p><p>Elder Di Que looked at Qin Sang with a smile on his face, as if he was negotiating.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, and his fists clenched tightly.</p><p>The thing he was most worried about had happened. This old immortal was definitely not a good person. He was another person like the Smiling Tiger! It made sense. He was a casual cultivator, but he had not only successfully formed a golden core, but he had also become a high-ranking member of the Xuanlan Pass and was able to get along with the various sects. How could he be a simple person?</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed the shockwaves in his heart and said politely, "This junior's cultivation is low. I'm afraid I won't be able to help senior with anything. Instead, I might hold senior back."</p><p>Elder Di Que was not moved. "This old man's judgment is not wrong. With Brother Qin's abilities, you will definitely succeed!"</p><p>The situation was stronger than the person. In the face of absolute strength, any struggle was futile.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled bitterly to himself and took a deep breath. "Please instruct me, senior. As long as this junior can do it, I will definitely do my best."</p><p>"Brother Qin is truly a kind-hearted person!"</p><p>Elder Di Que smiled with satisfaction. He turned around, stood with his hands behind his back, and looked at the Crimson Gold Vine. He said indifferently, "I will ask you, little brother, to help this old man pick the Crimson Gold Vine's fruit."</p>
