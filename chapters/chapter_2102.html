<h1>Chapter 2093: Observing from the Sidelines</h1><p>A monk presented a sealed letter, a plea for aid from Li Yu Fu and others.</p><p>The letter lay on the table, everyone looking at Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin said, “It will take time for everyone to agree on a clear plan, and mobilizing troops isn't something that can be done overnight.  If we delay too long, the situation will become irreversible.  Only the Western Wasteland can send reinforcements immediately.”</p><p>The Three Teach Alliance clearly intended to wait and see, but given Fan Laomo's reasons, it was hard to blame them.  Other factions likely felt the same.</p><p>Fan Laomo said with displeasure, “Does the Master mean we should send troops without consulting the others?”</p><p>“The Western Wasteland army has the authority to act as needed; it was established from the beginning.  In this urgent situation, and since we are not sending all our cultivators to the North Sea, leaving enough troops to defend against external threats; those remaining can rush to the North Sea to relieve its immediate crisis,” Master Huaiyin paused slightly, then said to Fan Laomo, “If the Western Wasteland is in danger, as long as the Central Plains and the Eastern Sea provide timely reinforcements, it should be able to hold.”</p><p>Valley Master Mu and others nodded in agreement.</p><p>Bao Xi, overjoyed, paid her respects to Master Huaiyin, “Master, your righteousness is profound!”</p><p>Fan Laomo snorted.  Master Huaiyin was clearly forcing the Three Teach Alliance to make a quick decision; a blatant maneuver, but he couldn't threaten them with the Central Plains abandoning the Western Wasteland.</p><p>In fact, Fan Laomo knew very well that not all factions would obey his orders, and the Three Teach Alliance wanted to see a weakened North Sea, not one occupied by the Changyou.</p><p>Before the North Sea falls, they still need to save it.</p><p>Thinking of this, Fan Laomo didn’t openly rebuke Master Huaiyin, but turned to someone else, “Daoist Lingshou, what's your opinion?”</p><p>This person looked old, with long whiskers on his upper lip, a round tortoise shell on his back, his figure somewhat stooped and thin, as if he were shrinking into the shell.</p><p>He was a spirit tortoise who had attained enlightenment, with the Dharma name Lingshou. He hailed from the Eastern Sea and was a high-ranking general under the Dragon Whale Sage.</p><p>Since the beginning of the discussion, Saint Lingshou had remained silent, his eyelids drooping, his breathing steady, appearing drowsy, offering no opinion.</p><p>Fan Laomo looked intently at him, and Lingshou, seeing he couldn't avoid it, his eyelids fluttered, and he slowly stroked his beard, saying unhurriedly, “Without the Dragon Whale Sage's edict, I dare not make a decision. However, whatever your intentions, I will diligently guard the Western Wasteland.”</p><p>Lingshou's answer was very evasive; he didn’t want to get involved, but he wasn’t opposing anyone either.</p><p>Fan Laomo sighed, and asked Master Huaiyin, “Master, how many troops do you intend to send to reinforce the North Sea?”</p><p>Master Huaiyin looked at Bao Xi, “The Four Saints Palace's cultivators are stationed at Qiong Mountain. I'll send someone to replace them and have the monks hidden in Gu Shui Abyss follow Bao. How does that sound?”</p><p>Yuan Zhu chimed in, “The situation in the north is still under control; I can also spare some demon soldiers for Bao.”</p><p>Bao Xi bowed, “Thank you both. I will not disappoint you!”</p><p>Then, Valley Master Mu revealed surprising news, “I won’t be sending any troops to Bao. I just received a message from Daoist Fang; the Witch Clan has decided to immediately send troops to the North Sea. They might already be on their way.”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was surprised.</p><p>The Demon Clan was silent, the Three Teach Alliance offered various excuses, and the weakest Witch Clan was the first to offer firm support to the North Sea.</p><p>The situation hadn't developed as Fan Laomo had anticipated. The Western Wasteland and the Witch Clan were too decisive. Master Huaiyin’s straightforward nature was understandable, but he hadn’t expected the cunning old Daoist Fang to forgo observation.</p><p>However, the Changyou's attack was fierce, aiming to seize the North Sea. These reinforcements could only delay them.  Ultimately, to turn the tide, they would still have to rely on others.</p><p>Thinking this, Fan Laomo slammed his hand on the table, “Since you've decided, why should I play the villain! You better pray nothing happens to the Western Wasteland!”</p><p>With that, Fan Laomo left in a huff, and Saint Lingshou also rose shakily to take his leave.</p><p>…</p><p>Central Plains Continent.</p><p>West of the Southern Barbarian Two States, beyond countless mountains, lies a relatively flat wasteland, though still dominated by peaks and hills, with only small plains.</p><p>The Witch Clan dwells in this region. The Witch Clan's sacred mountain, migrated from the Witch God Continent, sits in the very center of this area, revered by the Witch Clan people.</p><p>The sacred mountain holds a high status in the hearts of the Witch Clan, due to ancient legends and because it's where the Great Witch Priest cultivates.</p><p>After arriving on the Central Continent, the Wu tribe discovered several more sacred training grounds, rivaling, even surpassing, the Sacred Mountain in significance. Many Wu elders established their secluded retreats there, yet the Sacred Mountain's status remained unshakeable.</p><p>Even after the cataclysm, despite the severe damage and utter destruction of the Sacred Shrine, Fang Laomo, the High Priest, never considered relocation.</p><p>Atop the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>The scars of the cataclysm remained. The summit was completely obliterated by the blood wind.</p><p>Later, the blood wind coalesced into a crimson storm hanging above the mountain, slowly dissipating only after a long time.</p><p>The persistent blood wind instilled fear and was considered an ill omen by the Wu people.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators felt fear and trepidation before its power.  This is why they believed Qin Sang, having been targeted by the Blood Sun, had no hope of survival.</p><p>The peak remained desolate.  Below, several ancient halls were scattered.</p><p>One was Fang Laomo's sleeping quarters.</p><p>A young Wu tribesman approached the palace, gently touching the restriction.  A voice said, "Enter." He pushed open the door and saw a cicada on the throne.  He bowed respectfully, "Child greets foster father!"</p><p>The cicada remained motionless. Fang Laomo's voice echoed, "Rise."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The young man straightened, "Everything is prepared as you instructed, foster father."</p><p>Fang Laomo hummed, "Take them to the North Sea yourself. Go now."</p><p>The young man hesitated.</p><p>"What troubles you?" Fang Laomo saw through him.</p><p>"I have a question, foster father," the young man knelt on one knee, "The lack of response from the Three Teach Alliance and the two factions of demons is unusual. Why not wait before deciding? The greater their conflict, the more advantageous it is for us, isn't it?"</p><p>Fang Laomo seemed to have anticipated this, his tone unwavering.  He countered, "Do you think they will allow the North Sea to fall?"</p><p>The young man paused, then said, "The Three Teach Alliance will certainly not stand idly by. The demons, however, are uncertain."</p><p>"Fairy Liuli, the Three Teach Alliance, the demons…"</p><p>Fang Laomo said calmly, "Any one of them far surpasses our tribe in power.  For our tribe to survive and recuperate, we must ally with one of them.  We previously chose to stand with Fairy Liuli. If the North Sea suffers a devastating blow and declines, we will have to rely on the Three Teach Alliance or the demons.  Since they are both outsiders, what's the difference?"</p><p>"The demons are arrogant, the Three Teach Alliance tyrannical. It's better to rely on Fairy Liuli. Her character is evident; she distributes the Azure Spirit Qi fairly and has never discriminated against our tribe," the young man murmured, understanding his foster father's intentions. He sighed, "Oh, Wu God, when will our tribe rise again and escape this predicament!"</p><p>"As long as we exist in this vast world, there is hope. As long as our tribe continues, we will eventually encounter other members of our kind…"</p><p>Fang Laomo's voice faded. The young man silently withdrew.</p><p>…</p><p>The Three Teach Alliance headquarters.</p><p>Three high chairs sat at the head, representing the Eight Scenery Sect, the Ganlu Zen Monastery, and the Tianhao Tower. One remained empty due to the absence of Fan Laomo; the others were occupied by the Seven Prudent Monarch from the Eight Scenery Sect and the Compassionate Saint from the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>They sat high, looking down at the assembly below.</p><p>Below sat various experts, including sect masters and grand elders.</p><p>After the three sects – Buddhist, Taoist, and Demonic – formed an alliance, they brought in other affiliated sects, forming the Three Teach Alliance. Later, when Qin Sang ordered the Alliance to gather Central Continent's strength to search for the Ascension Platform, the other sects, unable to resist, also joined, though their influence paled in comparison to the three major sects.</p><p>Now, the Seven Prudent Monarch and the Compassionate Saint had summoned all sects of the Central Continent, regardless of alliance membership, to announce the North Sea disaster and discuss the situation.</p><p>It was unusual for smaller sects to have a say in major decisions, instead of just following the larger ones.</p><p>The sects argued fiercely. Some said the North Sea should be saved; others warned of a Changyou clan feint, fearing an attack on the Central Continent.  Others dismissed the North Sea's plight as alarmist, arguing that with Fairy Liuli there, such a swift defeat was impossible,  likely a ploy to avoid casualties and avoid sending reinforcements to their deaths…</p><p>Cultivators had vivid imaginations.  The discussion became so heated that some openly clashed, accusing each other of ill intent, turning the hall into a marketplace.</p><p>The meeting dragged on, with no end in sight.  Qi Shen Zhenjun and Yin Ci Shengzhe made no attempt to expedite things.</p><p>Night fell, still without a resolution. Yin Ci Shengzhe adjourned the meeting until the following day.</p><p>Lu Zhang left the hall alone, returning to his palace on Bu Nian Mountain.  Gazing at the moon, he sighed softly.</p><p>"Why the melancholy, Lu Zhangmen?" a clear voice called from behind.</p><p>Lu Zhang, who had sensed the approach, didn't turn around.  "Haven't you noticed anything unusual lately, Poison King?"</p><p>The Poison King joined Lu Zhang, looking out at the night. He chuckled, "Forgive my dull eyes, but Qi Shen Zhenjun and Yin Ci Shengzhe are not known for their decisiveness. If they were, they'd be the leaders of the Three Sects.  Their hesitation, coupled with their lack of influence compared to the three sect masters, is hardly surprising.  They're simply struggling to control the situation."</p><p>Lu Zhang chuckled dryly, shaking his head without comment.</p><p>"However," the Poison King continued thoughtfully, "the timing of the three sect masters' seclusion is rather…convenient, especially considering they're refining such an important treasure.  I wonder how confident they are in their success?"</p><p>Lu Zhang frowned slightly. "What are you implying?"</p><p>The Poison King shook his head. "I'm merely observing, nothing more.  It's likely a coincidence."</p><p>Lu Zhang had entertained similar doubts, but quickly dismissed them.  The Three Teach Alliance would never collude with the Changyou Clan, regardless.</p><p>"If that's the case, please be careful with your words.  Misunderstandings are best avoided."</p><p>The Poison King nodded, dropping the subject. His tone shifted. "I hear you were close to Qin Zhenjun in your younger days?"</p><p>Lu Zhang's eyes softened with remembrance. He sighed, "Thanks to Qin Daoyou's help, I was able to break through to the late Yuan Ying stage. Sadly, my senior brother decided to seal the mountain, and I was unable to assist Qin Daoyou in his time of need."</p><p>"Liuli Xianzi is Qin Zhenjun's widow, and Qingyang Guan is the sect he founded.  Regardless of the outcome here, you'll be sending reinforcements to the North Sea, won't you?" the Poison King asked.</p><p>Lu Zhang didn't hesitate.  "Indeed.  What are your plans?"  He knew the Poison King's visit and this line of questioning were no accident.</p><p>"The Three Teach Alliance's position is unclear.  We rely on them, and that makes us hesitant. I'm sure you understand. However, I've developed several battlefield-ready poison formations over the years, and have trained select elders and disciples. I'm eager to test their effectiveness. If you agree, I'll station them at Bu Nian Mountain awaiting your commands," said the Poison King.</p><p>Lu Zhang straightened.  "I thank you on behalf of Li Guan Zhu."</p><p>Before he finished, more sounds of approaching travel broke the silence.  It was the Qiongying Sect's leader and Mu Tangzhu of Liu Zhou Tang.</p><p>The Qiongying Sect leader was a woman, with a graceful figure, but her face was veiled, concealing her features.</p><p>Mu Tangzhu and Liu Zhou Tang were no longer the same.  With Liuli's support, they were no longer just a merchant guild in the Central Plains; their influence extended across the North Sea and the Central Plains, making them a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>"Greetings, Master慕容 and Tangzhu Mu!" Lu Zhang and the Poison King bowed.</p><p>Their presence did not surprise them. Master慕容 returned the greeting and stated plainly, "Shen Mengzhu's sect is under attack, and the Tian Gong Alliance's members are enraged. We cannot stand idly by.  This debate may drag on indefinitely; we cannot rely on these people. I'd like to know your opinion, Master Lu. Should we send reinforcements?"</p><p>Mu Tangzhu added, "Liu Zhou Tang is already working at full capacity, sending medicines and magical artifacts to the North Sea!"</p><p>The Poison King smiled. "We're thinking alike.  I was just discussing this with Lu Zhangmen!"</p><p>Other factions took varying actions:  some hedged their bets, others watched from the sidelines…</p><p>…East Sea.</p><p>In the most secluded palace of the Dragon Whale King.</p><p>The Dragon Whale King was not in seclusion; he sat on his throne, a powerful figure. A subordinate妖修 knelt before him, reporting on the current situation.</p><p>"The Three Teach Alliance hasn't moved yet?"</p><p>The Dragon Whale King rubbed his chin, surprised. He fell into thought, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>His gaze fell upon a message before him, a plea for help from Li Yu Fu and others.</p><p>The Three Teach Alliance must have received it as well, but their attitude was intriguing.</p><p>"Any news from those in the Demon Sea?"</p><p>The 妖修 replied, "Not yet."</p><p>After a long silence, the Dragon Whale King waved his hand, and the message floated to the 妖修. "Remember, I'm in seclusion, striving for a breakthrough. You are to remain still, keep a close watch on the Three Teach Alliance and the Demon Sea.  Report to me immediately if anything develops!"</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>The 妖修 carefully put away the message and retreated.</p>
