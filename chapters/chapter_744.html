<h1>Chapter 736: Great Battle Against the Demons</h1><p>Qin Sang knew escape was impossible.</p><p>Behind him were two great demons. One was a Black Hawk, exceptionally divine and swift, capable of wielding golden lightning. The other was a winged Flying Fish with a bizarre appearance.</p><p>They were incredibly powerful, among the elites of their respective ranks, each no weaker than the Twin-Headed Beast, perhaps even stronger.  They coordinated flawlessly, flanking Qin Sang from both sides.</p><p>Even more worrying, Qin Sang faced not only these two, but other great demons in the distance, drawn by the Giant Turtle's summons, were converging on their location.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look back, his sword clearing a path as he ruthlessly slaughtered the lesser demons.</p><p>The sea ran red with blood, waves churning as countless demon corpses bobbed on the surface.</p><p>The two great demons closed in, relentlessly pursuing.  Qin Sang's eyes flashed, a fierce expression hardening his face. He abruptly sheathed his sword and turned, fixating his gaze on the strange Flying Fish.</p><p>The Flying Fish's heart skipped a beat, instinct screaming danger!</p><p>In the next instant, Qin Sang sprang into action.</p><p>He had planned this.  He knew that being entangled by two great demons within the demon horde would mean a slow, agonizing death. The best strategy was to divide and conquer, eliminating one first.</p><p>Previously, faced with such a situation, Qin Sang's only option would have been to flee.  But now, having broken through to the middle stage of Core Formation, his power had soared. He was no longer as apprehensive, even believing victory might be within his grasp.</p><p>With talismans and Sword Qi Thunder Sound deployed simultaneously, Qin Sang's speed explosively increased to an astonishing degree. Like a streak of red lightning, his escape light expanded rapidly within the Flying Fish's eyes.</p><p>The Flying Fish shrieked, a sound as eerie as a child's wail.</p><p>This battle-hardened great demon wasn't panicked.  It cried out to the Black Hawk for help, while simultaneously puffing out its cheeks and expelling a silvery-white pearl.</p><p>Qin Sang initially thought it was the Flying Fish's demon core, but a closer look revealed otherwise. It seemed to be some kind of pearl the Flying Fish had acquired in the deep sea.</p><p>This pearl was no ordinary object; its aura rivaled that of a magical treasure. How it had formed remained a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered demons capable of refining treasures before, but they were extremely rare.</p><p>After releasing the pearl, the Flying Fish's abdomen swelled, and it spewed a cloud of green gas onto the pearl.  The pearl spun rapidly, churning the green gas into beams of azure light.</p><p>Within the depths of the azure light, fist-sized orbs of strange light pulsed, even more dazzling than the surrounding glow. And within these orbs, lightning flickered.</p><p>"Some kind of divine lightning... Is it the Flying Fish's own power, or the pearl's?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.  The power of the green orbs was substantial; he could already feel their sting. Without hesitation, he pointed his Ebony Sword, unleashing the Blood-Corrupting Divine Light.</p><p>Touched by the Blood-Corrupting Divine Light, the pearl's luster dimmed, its rotation slowing as it began to tremble violently.</p><p>The azure light dispersed, the divine lightning failing to fully form.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed didn't falter.  He crashed through the remnants of the divine lightning, closing in on the Flying Fish in an instant. Sheathing the Ebony Sword, he flicked his sleeve, sending the Ten Yama Banners fluttering forth. The Nine Nether Demonic Flames manifested before the Flying Fish's very eyes.</p><p>The Flying Fish was both shocked and enraged.  Escape was now impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang's attack was as swift as his earlier assault on the Twin-Headed Beast.  The Nine Nether Demonic Flames engulfed the Flying Fish, its protective spiritual light shattering almost instantly.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Smashed by the Nine Nether Demonic Flames, the Flying Fish wailed, the flesh on its back corroded by the flames, one wing reduced to a skeletal frame.</p><p>To make matters worse, its consciousness was also assaulted by the demonic flames, leaving it disoriented.</p><p>The Flying Fish reeled, unable to steady itself before the Twin-Headed Beast arrived.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Beast pounced upon the Flying Fish, its hooves trampling its body as both heads bit into vital points.  Blades of wind shot from its vertical pupils, tearing into the Flying Fish.</p><p>The Flying Fish shrieked incessantly, its body riddled with wounds, blood flowing freely.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly, devoid of pity.  Just as he was about to further unleash the Nine Nether Demonic Flames to finish it off, a sudden tension in his back made his hairs stand on end.</p><p>The Black Hawk attacked, bathed in golden light. With a screech, it unleashed an exceptionally thick bolt of golden lightning that tore through the void, aimed directly at Qin Sang's back.</p><p>The golden lightning struck obliquely, with terrifying speed and power.  Focused on killing the Flying Fish, Qin Sang had left himself vulnerable to the Black Hawk's attack.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Qin Sang chose not to dodge. Without looking back, he channeled all his power into the Nine Nether Demonic Flames, still aimed at the Flying Fish.</p><p>Battered by the Twin-Headed Beast, the Flying Fish was powerless to resist the demonic flames. With a final, desperate shriek, its vital points were breached, and it perished.</p><p>At the same moment, the golden lightning slammed into Qin Sang.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Blinding golden light filled the space where Qin Sang had stood, engulfing his entire being.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Beast retreated hastily, its gaze filled with a complex mix of emotions as it looked towards the light.</p><p>Moments later, a battered figure burst forth from the golden glow. Qin Sang's face was pale, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, but his body seemed remarkably unscathed.</p><p>Strangest of all, a faint golden shield shimmered around him, now almost completely dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang darted behind the Twin-Headed Beast, quickly assessing his condition.  He breathed a sigh of relief. The Golden Radiance Armor's defensive power had proven its worth; without it, he would have been severely injured.</p><p>He had to press his advantage against the Flying Fish.  If he hadn't finished it off while it was weakened, it would have recovered, rendering his efforts pointless. He was willing to risk the Black Hawk's attack to eliminate the Flying Fish.</p><p>His confidence stemmed from the Golden Radiance Armor, a treasure whose durability rivaled that of a mid-grade magical treasure. It hadn't disappointed him; his injuries were relatively minor.</p><p>Trading these injuries for the life of a great demon was a worthwhile exchange.</p><p>Qin Sang swallowed a healing pill, a flush of color returning to his face as he forcefully suppressed his injuries.  He glared at the Black Hawk, growling, "Continue!"</p><p>Now, the tables had turned. Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Beast were the ones flanking the Black Hawk.</p><p>Having witnessed the Flying Fish's demise, the Black Hawk was terrified.  It turned to flee, shrieking orders at the lesser demons to block Qin Sang and calling upon the Giant Turtle for help.</p><p>The distance between them was already small, and the lesser demons posed little threat.  Qin Sang easily caught up to the Black Hawk. With the Twin-Headed Beast joining the fray, the outcome was clear.</p><p>Trapped within the demon horde by the two great demons, Qin Sang's situation had been perilous. By risking injury and swiftly eliminating the Flying Fish, he had completely reversed the situation.</p><p>The Black Hawk struggled, but its defeat was inevitable.  It could no longer turn the tide.</p><p>Its cries reached the distant battlefield.</p><p>Both the Giant Turtle and Yuan Sanzhen witnessed the scene.  The Giant Turtle was enraged, while Yuan Sanzhen was overjoyed.</p>
