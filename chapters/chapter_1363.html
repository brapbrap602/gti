<h1>Chapter 1355: Peach Blossoms Still Smile in the Spring Breeze</h1><p>Qin Sang received the urgent letter.</p><p>After reading it, he let out a soft 'hmm,' a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Jing Yu looked over curiously.</p><p>"A few days ago, Dongyang Bo passed the position of Sect Master to a disciple, and left Shaohua Mountain," Qin Sang masked the letter, looking towards the direction of Shaohua Mountain, his eyes flickering.</p><p>A hint of joy flashed in his eyes, followed by vigilance and contemplation.</p><p>He pondered the deeper meaning of Dongyang Bo's actions, wondering if there was a hidden conspiracy.</p><p>Since the Blood Pool battle, Dongyang Bo had been very 'well-behaved.'</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately created opportunities for him on the battlefield, but Dongyang Bo didn't take the bait.</p><p>Dongyang Bo definitely knew the origins of the puppet in Qin Sang's hands, but in all these years, there hadn't been any rumors about Nascent Soul Talisman Puppets in the cultivation world.</p><p>Dongyang Bo meticulously plotted against Gongliang Yu, only to have everything benefit Qin Sang in the end, and he himself was injured by Qin Sang. It seemed he had truly resigned himself to fate.</p><p>Qin Sang had released his hatred in his heart, and no longer harbored thoughts of revenge.</p><p>The two had remained at peace with each other.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Shaohua Mountain had quietly changed hands.</p><p>"Someone at Shaohua Mountain has broken through to the Nascent Soul stage, who is it?"</p><p>Jing Yu knew about the grudges between Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo, and had carefully investigated the details of Shaohua Mountain. He counted Dongyang Bo's famous disciples, "It is said that the disciple with the best talent at Shaohua Mountain, and the one Dongyang Bo publicly favored the most, is a disciple named Qiu Mubai, who is already in the late Golden Core stage, but he is still a bit short of the Nascent Soul bottleneck. The one with the most hope of forming his Nascent Soul, whose cultivation has reached the peak of the Golden Core stage, should be Che Yutao, right?"</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang slowly shook his head.</p><p>"Neither! Che Yutao failed to break through the Nascent Soul stage bottleneck, and perished in his cave half a year ago. Qiu Mubai also hasn't formed his Nascent Soul, and Dongyang Bo took him away when he left."</p><p>Jing Yu was stunned. "If it's not these two favored disciples, could it be that Shaohua Mountain has produced another genius?"</p><p>"Not some genius, and no one at Shaohua Mountain has formed their Nascent Soul. The person who took over from Dongyang Bo is -- Mu Yifeng!"</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the urgent letter in his hand, his tone complex.</p><p>After returning to the Northern Chen Realm, Qin Sang had always wanted to meet Mu Yifeng.</p><p>He now had the ability to repay Mu Yifeng.</p><p>But for decades, even during the most dangerous times of the Three Realms War, Mu Yifeng had always been diligently cultivating at Shaohua Mountain, never stepping out of his sect.</p><p>Because of Dongyang Bo, Qin Sang couldn't act rashly, and could only send people to infiltrate the market towns outside Shaohua Mountain, keeping a constant watch, waiting for Mu Yifeng to emerge from seclusion.</p><p>But unexpectedly, he finally received this news.</p><p>Mu Yifeng had become the master of a sect!</p><p>Dongyang Bo passed the position to Mu Yifeng, instead of his favored disciple Qiu Mubai. Was it because he acknowledged that Mu Yifeng's cultivation and talent were stronger than Qiu Mubai, or was there another deeper meaning?</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't be so naive as to think it was a coincidence.</p><p>If Mu Yifeng took charge of Shaohua Mountain, he would definitely give his full support.</p><p>With his status in the Northern Chen Alliance, he could guarantee that, at least for the next few hundred years, no one would dare to cause trouble for Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>If it were Qiu Mubai, it would be different.</p><p>He wouldn't vent his anger on Qiu Mubai, but he also couldn't provide him with any help.</p><p>He wouldn't need to personally target him, he would only need to hint, or reveal his attitude, to allow Shaohua Mountain, having lost Dongyang Bo, to be ostracized by all sides.</p><p>If Dongyang Bo had precisely calculated this, that was why he passed Shaohua Mountain to Mu Yifeng.</p><p>He probably knew a long time ago that Mu Yifeng had let him go back then!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank slightly.</p><p>"It's actually him?"</p><p>Jing Yu was also quite surprised. After figuring out the key, he clicked his tongue twice. "Dongyang Bo is indeed a cunning old fox! Mu Yifeng disobeyed his master's orders and let you go. Dongyang Bo was actually able to endure for hundreds of years, and even push him to the position of Sect Master, it's truly unexpected!"</p><p>"Not necessarily! Mu Yifeng wasn't in the Golden Core stage back then, he wasn't of much value, and Dongyang Bo's magnanimity isn't that great."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>He recalled the information he had found earlier. Mu Yifeng's cave was on Pure Moon Peak.</p><p>The reason why Dongyang Bo could let Mu Yifeng go was probably related to Chen Yan.</p><p>What's done could not be undone.</p><p>Moreover, Dongyang Bo hadn't completely fallen out with Chen Yan, and they had reached some kind of agreement.</p><p>If Chen Yan pleaded for Mu Yifeng, with Dongyang Bo's deep machinations, it wasn't unimaginable that he would endure this matter.</p><p>However, Qin Sang also hadn't expected that Dongyang Bo would once again use Mu Yifeng as a pawn to put him in check.</p><p>"Where did Dongyang Bo go?"</p><p>Jing Yu asked again.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, "Mu Yifeng isn't sure either, but Dongyang Bo personally told Mu Yifeng before leaving that this time, he probably wouldn't have a chance to return!"</p><p>Jing Yu pondered, "I remember Qing Jun Daoist friend once said that the speed of Dongyang Bo's cultivation increase was very abnormal. After breaking through the bottleneck, it suddenly stagnated. He hasn't made any progress in the past hundred years, and she suspected that he used some kind of evil art with great hidden dangers to forcibly break through. His Heavenly Tribulation is still a hundred years away. Even if he can't survive the Heavenly Tribulation, he can push Qiu Mubai to at least the peak of the Golden Core stage. Now he suddenly left, could it be that the hidden dangers are about to erupt?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Jing Yu's guess was very likely close to the truth.</p><p>Dongyang Bo valued the sect's inheritance very much. With him personally in charge, no one could suppress Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Now he left the sect without a word, there must be a reason.</p><p>The entire Northern Chen Realm was under the control of the Northern Chen Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he exchanged a look with Jing Yu.</p><p>"The Three Realms of the Northern Sea!"</p><p>Qin Sang paced back and forth, "Chen Yan has a mysterious master. The secret technique Dongyang Bo used to break through the bottleneck was likely from Chen Yan's hand, one of the conditions for their renewed cooperation. If Dongyang Bo wants to resolve the hidden dangers, he can only ask Chen Yan for help! With his cultivation, the hope of passing through the storm belt alone is very high. However, why did he risk bringing Qiu Mubai along?"</p><p>Jing Yu laughed, "Perhaps he's afraid you'll vent your anger on his favored disciple."</p><p>"Then he underestimates me too much."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly.</p><p>Revenge has its source, debts have their owners.</p><p>All hatred was only between him and Dongyang Bo.</p><p>In his cultivation journey, the experience at Shaohua Mountain was an indelible memory, he wouldn't vent his anger on innocent people for no reason.</p><p>After thinking about it.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to the white cat and said, "Go and invite Mu Yifeng to Peach Blossom Valley... No, I'll go see him myself!"</p><p>Jing Yu got up and walked out of the valley with Qin Sang shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>Qingyang Temple's Mountain Gate was the original site of the Yuan Mirage Gate.</p><p>Before Qing Jun left, she entrusted the Yuan Mirage Gate to Qin Sang's disposal, but Qin Sang didn't want to absorb so many Yuan Mirage Gate disciples, so as to avoid being too powerful to control. Thus, he chose a spiritual vein of lower quality in the southern foothills of the Heavenly Walk Plateau and moved the Yuan Mirage Gate there.</p><p>No one in the Northern Chen Alliance objected, and the Yuan Mirage Gate disciples didn't dare to disobey Qin Sang's decision.</p><p>The white cat hopped and skipped behind them.</p><p>The entrance of Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>The mist parted to both sides, and one man and two demons flew out of Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>It was another sunset.</p><p>The setting sun shone in from the outside.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang flew out, his body was draped in a golden glow. He suddenly felt something, his figure paused slightly, and he turned to look at Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>The peach blossoms were in full bloom, dyeing the peach forest in vibrant colors.</p><p>The scenery was incredibly beautiful.</p><p>"Ten years..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly in his heart.</p><p>He still remembered.</p><p>At that time, the face and peach blossoms complemented each other in rosy beauty.</p><p>And now, the peach blossoms still smile in the spring breeze.</p>
