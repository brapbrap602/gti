<h1>Chapter 605: The Ghost Path</h1><p>Chapter 605: The Ghost Path</p><p>Ripples of blue light pulsed in the tunnel.</p><p>Looking up, they saw a幽蓝 lake overhead, like a curtain of water, within reach.  They were beneath a small lake; the tunnel was hidden beneath the lakebed.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Entering the tunnel, Dongyang Bo showed no hesitation. He led Qin Sang and the others, swiftly moving towards the tunnel's end.</p><p>The tunnel was incredibly long.  Although winding, it was clear and unobstructed, without any barriers. Dongyang Bo sped them along for a full fifteen minutes, yet they still hadn't reached the end.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally calculated their direction. Based on the location of the lake outside, they were deep within the mountain. However, the tunnel walls glowed with a strange light, clearly showing the presence of some kind of restriction.  Their current path likely didn't correspond to the outside. Otherwise, with Dongyang Bo's speed, they would have circled Mount Heaven countless times in fifteen minutes.</p><p>After another fifteen minutes, the tunnel suddenly opened up.</p><p>At the tunnel's exit, Qin Sang and the others were speechless, staring in shock at what lay before them.</p><p>Even Chen Yan seemed lost for words.</p><p>Before them was an extraordinarily wide passage, dozens of meters high, its far end shrouded in darkness.  The walls, floor, and ceiling were coated in a smooth, glazed material.</p><p>What shocked them all were the countless ferocious ghosts painted on this glaze!</p><p>Ghouls, skeletons, pale eyes, crimson tongues, bare bones, flying flesh…</p><p>Countless monstrous ghosts filled the entire passage.  Every imaginable ghost imaginable was depicted here, vivid and lifelike, seeming truly real.</p><p>They were sealed beneath the glaze, appearing ready to break free at any moment, to devour souls and blood!</p><p>This was clearly a Ghost Path!</p><p>If it weren't for the absence of the legendary Yellow Springs Road, they would have thought they had arrived in hell.</p><p>Qin Sang's back felt cold.  In this place, he felt as if countless ferocious gazes were fixed on him, coveting his life force and flesh.</p><p>This feeling came from the nearby ghosts. Sealed beneath the glaze, they remained motionless, yet their eyes seemed to truly watch him.</p><p>In fact, it wasn't just Qin Sang; Qiu Mu Bai and the others felt the same.</p><p>Targeted by countless ghosts, their bodies froze, their spirits and blood seeming to congeal; they dared not move.</p><p>Dongyang Bo pointed to the Ghost Path ahead, addressing Chen Yan:</p><p>"The reason I went to such lengths to bring these five, instead of having Foundation Establishment disciples control the Five Elements Beast Seal, is because of this Ghost Path.</p><p>"Whether it's due to the unique restrictions here, or because ghosts were actually sealed here…</p><p>"Stepping onto the Ghost Path will instantly alert them.</p><p>"Awakened ghosts will surround us, making it impossible to advance. We'll have to fight our way through. Although they aren't particularly powerful individually, their numbers are immense. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator could only protect themselves, with little ability to safeguard others.</p><p>"However, this Ghost Path has a peculiar characteristic: it only reacts to those with exceptionally strong life force, and this reaction cannot be blocked.</p><p>"These five are only at the Foundation Establishment stage and have not undergone the spiritual energy infusion of the Golden Core stage.  They can pass unnoticed, unharmed.  Che Yu Tao and the others cannot.</p><p>"Let them go first, and then the two of us will follow."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang and the others were amazed.  Such a strange place existed in the world.</p><p>Avoiding the battle with the ghosts eased their tension somewhat. However, the thought of traversing this path alone still filled them with unease and worry, fearing an accident and being devoured by countless ghosts.</p><p>"Master, are these ghosts alive?  Were they perhaps sealed here after ancient cultivators hunted them?" Qiu Mu Bai, emboldened by Dongyang Bo's favor, dared to ask.</p><p>Dongyang Bo shook his head.  "They're not alive. What appears are merely ghostly shadows. Whether it's a naturally formed restriction or the residual traces of real ghosts after their annihilation, it's hard to say. Alright, go ahead.  Walk boldly; don't be afraid.  They wouldn't care for your flesh and blood."</p><p>Disdained by ghosts.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others felt complicated emotions, yet dared not disobey Dongyang Bo's orders.</p><p>The five exchanged glances, gathering around Qiu Mu Bai. Ji Qing led the way, cautiously stepping onto the passage, his foot landing squarely on a ghost's face.</p><p>Ji Qing felt a chill crawl up his spine.  He took a couple more steps, noticing no change in the corridor, and cautiously pressed on.</p><p>He strode forward, deeper into the Devil's Path, into what felt like hell itself.</p><p>By now, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan were out of sight.  The thought of a mishap with no one to help sent a shiver down their spines, and they broke into a run.</p><p>*Thump, thump, thump…*</p><p>Their footsteps echoed on the glazed surface of the corridor, sounding like death knells pursuing them.</p><p>Time had never seemed to move so slowly. The corridor felt endless, stretching into an infinite darkness ahead.</p><p>“Finally!”</p><p> Qiu Mu Bai breathed a sigh of relief, reaching the end at last.  This Devil's Path was terrifying; even his composure had been shaken, leaving him drenched in sweat.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath.  He had actually been the most worried about an accident.  Although he hadn’t undergone spiritual energy infusion, the Corpse Puppet Bag contained a Flying Night Rakshasa currently undergoing transformation, far more powerful than a true Golden Core cultivator.  He had feared the Rakshasa's aura might attract the devils, but thankfully, nothing happened.  He suspected it was due to the Rakshasa, as a lifeless being, having very weak life force.</p><p>Two massive stone doors stood at the end of the Devil's Path.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai stepped forward and pushed them open. The group filed in, discovering a large hall beyond, with a path continuing further.  Unwilling to risk exploring this place, they cautiously remained hidden behind the stone doors, waiting for Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan.</p><p>Initially, there was silence.</p><p>Suddenly, the ground trembled violently. The heavy stone doors couldn't block the terrifying howls.</p><p>On the other side of the doors, countless ghosts materialized!</p><p>Their ears were filled with an endless cacophony of ghostly cries, wails, and laughter – a bizarre mix that, even through the stone doors, unsettled their minds.</p><p>The four of them, Qiu Mu Bai and the others, went pale, their minds wavering under the assault of the ghostly sounds, struggling to maintain control.  They hurriedly entered meditative states to regain their composure.</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally unaffected, but he feigned weakness, sitting cross-legged on the ground.</p><p>This chaos continued.  There was no sign of Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan.</p><p>After a while, the stone doors creaked open, pushed from the other side by Dongyang Bo. Simultaneously, the ghostly wails ceased, and all the ghosts vanished instantly.</p><p>Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan entered, one after the other.  Their auras were unsteady, evidence of the ordeal they’d faced.</p><p>They weren't injured, however. After taking a restorative pill and briefly meditating, they fully recovered.</p>
