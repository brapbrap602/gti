<h1>Chapter 827: A Choice</h1><p>“Seems like it’s been a while…”</p><p>Qin Sang entered the courtyard and reached out to take the message talisman into his hand. It was indeed left two years ago. The talisman didn’t specify what the matter was, only that Qin Sang should contact the informant upon his return, and they would meet later.</p><p>He probably missed a good opportunity due to his absence.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's eyes, Elder Qing Zhu was far more important than Xiang Yi, and he didn't regret it.</p><p>Since his return, he had been paying close attention to news from the Gale Archipelago.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang donned his cloak, crushed the message talisman, left the courtyard, and walked towards the agreed-upon shop.</p><p>The shop owner was still the same white-haired old man.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the man's face lit up with joy. "Senior, you're finally back. My master returned two years ago, but left the next day."</p><p>"I had important matters to attend to, and I didn't expect to be delayed for so long," Qin Sang said in a deep voice. "Did Madam Liu leave any instructions before she left?"</p><p>The shopkeeper lowered his voice. "My master said that upon your return, I should inform her, and she would personally come to visit you. Since you're back, I'll send a message to my master right away."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I shouldn't be leaving Skyrise Island for the next few years. Madam Liu can come directly to the courtyard to see me when she returns."</p><p>After handling all the trivial matters, it was already nightfall when Qin Sang returned to his cave.</p><p>The stars were shining brightly.</p><p>He immediately began cultivating the *Demonic Refinement Technique*. Just past midnight, Qin Sang let out a soft whistle, his body crackled, and a thin layer of sweat emerged on his skin.</p><p>"Broke through to the second level, mid-stage!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed joy. He clenched his fist and sensed his strength; his physical body had indeed been greatly enhanced.</p><p>During his time in the Gale Archipelago, he was either traveling or investigating various information, cultivating intermittently, and finally broke through to the second level, mid-stage.</p><p>"I just bought some pills that are good for the physical body. If nothing unexpected happens, I can reach the late stage of the second transformation in a little over ten years and prepare for the breakthrough."</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time and made plans.</p><p>"Breaking through to the third level requires extremely high stellar energy infusion. Even a treasure like the Star Spirit Net is not enough. I must find a suitable location. Or find the other two spirit herbs and use their medicinal power to force a breakthrough. I need to prepare for both aspects simultaneously…"</p><p>Thinking of the spirit herbs, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He took out the Tyrant Blood Fruit and also brought out the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>"This fruit is called the Tyrant Blood Fruit, and it happens to be effective for your demon race. Take it. The Tyrant Blood Fruit has a potent effect and causes excruciating pain. Remember to use your bloodline power to refine the medicinal power. Your cultivation is good; there shouldn't be any problems…"</p><p>Qin Sang kept his promise and gave the spirit fruit he had promised to the Twin-Headed Serpent, explaining its effects.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent didn't hesitate; it eagerly snatched the spirit fruit and swallowed it in one gulp.</p><p>After consuming the spirit fruit, the Twin-Headed Serpent became somewhat restless.</p><p>Qin Sang stood guard, added several layers of restrictions, and observed the Twin-Headed Serpent's reaction.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent was among the best in the mid-stage of the Demon Core realm. After swallowing the Tyrant Blood Fruit, it was estimated that it could reach the peak of the mid-stage in one go, but the possibility of breaking through a realm was small.</p><p>Before transformation, breakthroughs for the demon race were even more difficult than for cultivators.</p><p>The Tyrant Blood Fruit was not a spirit herb for refining bloodlines or assisting breakthroughs.</p><p>The peaceful period was short-lived.</p><p>Not long after the Twin-Headed Serpent swallowed the Tyrant Blood Fruit, it suddenly let out a roar, its body arched sharply, and then slammed heavily onto the ground. A faint bloody light emerged from its surface.</p><p>Under the shroud of bloody light, the Twin-Headed Serpent's veins bulged like wriggling worms, rising and falling. Its bones seemed to be shifting, cracking, and the accompanying pain intensified.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent's face became distorted.</p><p>It clawed the ground with all four paws, its two heads shaking wildly, not knowing where to turn. Its vertical pupils were tightly closed, its face full of pain. Then, its body curled up tightly and trembled violently.</p><p>"Such a potent effect, and this is still immature. It truly lives up to its name as a brutal medicine."</p><p>Seeing the Twin-Headed Serpent's suffering, Qin Sang felt a little apprehensive.</p><p>He estimated that after he took the medicine, it would be even worse than the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>The medicinal effect continued to surge. The Twin-Headed Serpent's roar became hoarse, its body curled into a ball, using all its strength to resist the power of the Tyrant Blood Fruit. From its appearance, it was impossible to tell the change in its cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried; the Twin-Headed Serpent wouldn't be defeated by a mere spirit fruit.</p><p>After waiting for a while, seeing that the Twin-Headed Serpent remained in this state, without worsening, Qin Sang ignored it. Just as he was about to continue cultivating, he suddenly caught sight of something out of the corner of his eye, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>Between the two heads of the Twin-Headed Serpent, a small bump had appeared!</p><p>A late-stage Demon Core Twin-Headed Serpent would have a large bump between its two heads. When the bump turned into a third head, it meant that the Twin-Headed Serpent had entered the transformation stage!</p><p>The appearance of the small bump meant that the Twin-Headed Serpent was breaking through to the late stage of the Demon Core realm.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, his eyes flickering.</p><p>He faced a choice.</p><p>Once the Twin-Headed Serpent reached the late stage of Demon Core, it would exceed the control limit of the Concentric Rings and would break free from its restraints, escaping his control. Unexpectedly, the Twin-Headed Serpent, after taking the Tyrant Blood Fruit, could break through to the late stage in one go.</p><p>By preventing its breakthrough, he could still control the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>Such a powerful demon at the peak of the mid-stage wasn't easy to find, not to mention the Twin-Headed Serpent had excellent potential. Otherwise, he would have considered replacing the Twin-Headed Serpent long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, but ultimately he did nothing, quietly watching it.</p><p>Recalling his experiences over the years, the Twin-Headed Serpent had contributed both in effort and hardship. If it could truly break through, it was fate. He would give it its freedom. His current combat strength was also quite good; he didn't entirely rely on the Twin-Headed Serpent anymore.</p><p>Time passed bit by bit.</p><p>Until dawn, the bump on the Twin-Headed Serpent's head sometimes grew larger, sometimes smaller, but it was unable to break through. Its aura weakened considerably.</p><p>Another attempt at a breakthrough failed.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent opened its eyes and let out a mournful cry. It looked at Qin Sang, its eyes weak, as if begging.</p><p>Qin Sang understood; it wanted him to help.</p><p>He sighed lightly and said, "You know that after breaking through, you'll be free from all restrictions. Don't blame me for taking advantage of your weakness. If you can break through on your own, I'll let you go. Otherwise…"</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang took out a Tyrant Blood Fruit and placed it in front of the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>"I can give you this fruit, but you must acknowledge me as your master. For decades, you've followed me through various dangerous places; you've seen my performance. I'm not boasting, but I consider myself no less than any Core Formation cultivator, and I'm determined to reach Nascent Soul. Being my spirit beast isn't a disgrace. I can also help you find demon race cultivation techniques. Moreover, the lifespan of humans is far shorter than that of demon beasts. A Nascent Soul cultivator only lives for a little over a thousand years. I can promise to release your restraints before I pass away."</p><p>Qin Sang took a step back and said, "Think it over."</p><p>After acknowledging him as master, it would be one of his own, and he could pass the *Demonic Refinement Technique* to it. However, Qin Sang didn't explicitly say this. He suspected that the technique was tied to many secrets. If it were leaked to a transformed demon, it could bring disaster.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent didn't say a word, staring intently at the Tyrant Blood Fruit, struggling internally.</p>
