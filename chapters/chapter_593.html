<h1>Chapter 586: A Clever Ruse</h1><p>Qin Sang was both shocked and ecstatic upon hearing this news. If everything Cloud Wanderer said was true, then this Nine Phantasmal Orchid was most likely seized from the Suspended Palace by the founder of the Yuanzhao School. Otherwise, Yi Tiannie wouldn't be so persistent!</p><p>During their time in the Earth Sinkhole, Yi Tiannie had secretly gained control of the Night Devil. He could have easily escaped while Qin Sang was away, slowly figuring out how to erase Qin Sang's soul mark, refine the Night Devil's Nascent Soul, and completely possess its body.</p><p>The fact that he risked staying behind must have been because of the Nine Phantasmal Orchid!</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that with every word Cloud Wanderer spoke, Yi Tiannie's expression grew darker.</p><p>Finally, Cloud Wanderer chuckled softly and said, "Brother Qin, since this man has information about the Three Lights Jade Liquid, are you still worried about him destroying the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit Tree? The Three Lights Jade Liquid is known as a miraculous healing medicine. Curing your hidden injuries would be as easy as turning one's hand. Why bother with the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit? Apprehend him now!"</p><p>Cloud Wanderer suddenly roared.</p><p>Yi Tiannie's expression changed drastically. He never expected Cloud Wanderer to see through his bluff so easily.</p><p>With a few words, the tables had turned.</p><p>He had become the prey.</p><p>Black energy suddenly surged in Yi Tiannie's palm, and deathly Qi enveloped the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit Tree, as if he was about to destroy it.</p><p>He had discovered an ancient scroll taken from the Violet Firmament Palace while sorting through the belongings of Patriarch Kui Yin, learning about the Suspended Palace and the Three Lights Jade Liquid. Later, he stumbled upon a secret concerning the Violet Firmament Palace and deduced that it might still hold the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Learning this immediately ignited his ambition, and he recalled the Yuanzhao School's Nine Phantasmal Orchid.</p><p>The Nine Phantasmal Orchid was indeed seized by the founder of the Yuanzhao School from the Suspended Palace. It was the lowest-ranked among the several heavenly treasures found there. At the time, Patriarch Kui Yin had competed with the Yuanzhao founder for this herb, knowing full well that the orchid hadn't reached full maturity.</p><p>However, even immature, it was still a treasure. After a few hundred years, it could potentially grant the sect another Nascent Soul expert.</p><p>After the Yuanzhao founder's unexpected death, Patriarch Kui Yin had considered taking it. However, one of the Eight Righteous Sects, the Wuji Sect, intervened.  Considering the Yuanzhao School's own strength, he decided to give up.</p><p>He couldn't use it himself, and he'd be dust in a few hundred years.</p><p>Besides, there was no guarantee the Nine Phantasmal Orchid would lead to Nascent Soul formation. It wasn't worth antagonizing the Wuji Sect.</p><p>Yi Tiannie, with his lifespan nearing its end and one foot in the grave, was desperate for Nascent Soul formation. He was willing to risk everything, even the entire sect.</p><p>Therefore, after learning about the Three Lights Jade Liquid, he immediately began his preparations.</p><p>He not only tried every means to find weaknesses in the Yuanzhao School's protective formation but also cultivated a ghost Dao secret technique left by Patriarch Kui Yin. This was in case he couldn't find life-extending medicine and his lifespan didn't last until the Violet Firmament Palace opened, allowing him to switch to ghost cultivation.</p><p>The Transcendence Pill helps overcome the tribulations of breakthroughs.</p><p>It's not only useful for cultivators, but also for demon cultivators' transformations, ghost cultivators' advancements, and spirit insect metamorphoses.</p><p>Therefore, Yi Tiannie actually knew very little about the Three Lights Jade Liquid. His knowledge came from a damaged ancient scroll left by Patriarch Kui Yin. He wasn't even sure if it could heal Qin Sang.</p><p>Yet, Cloud Wanderer spoke with such certainty, seemingly knowing more about the Suspended Palace, the Soul Gathering Bowl, and the Three Lights Jade Liquid than he did.</p><p>Yi Tiannie was filled with suspicion. He realized that his threats wouldn't work. Qin Sang had already formed his external core, possessing strength comparable to the Night Devil. He also wielded powerful magical treasures, making him impossible to kill.</p><p>Thus, Yi Tiannie decided to retreat. However, he was ruthless and wanted to destroy the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit Tree, preventing Qin Sang from obtaining the fruit in the future.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Deathly Qi surged towards the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit Tree.</p><p>Just as the rare spiritual tree was about to be engulfed by the deathly Qi and destroyed by the devil's hand, a white light suddenly emerged from its roots. This light originated from the same source as the light Cloud Wanderer had previously activated – the Demon King's blood restriction.</p><p>'Poof!'</p><p>The white light instantly enveloped the entire Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit Tree, effortlessly dispersing the deathly Qi.</p><p>It turned out that the Demon King who discovered the tree and left the blood restriction intended it as a legacy for his descendants.</p><p>First, it sealed the aura of the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit, concealing this treasure trove from human cultivators.</p><p>Second, it protected the tree, preventing his descendants from damaging the treasure trove and the spiritual tree during their fights for the fruit.</p><p>Yi Tiannie's attempt to destroy the tree triggered the Demon King's blood restriction.</p><p>However, the Demon King's intention was to protect the tree, not to harm anyone. After the blood restriction activated, it didn't attack Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Yi Tiannie's attack failed. Seeing that the white light hadn't targeted him, he quickly guessed the reason and immediately withdrew his deathly Qi, reaching for a Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit.</p><p>This time, the Demon King's blood restriction didn't interfere.</p><p>However, just as Yi Tiannie's fingers were about to grasp the fruit, a faint image of a pearl appeared in front of it – the Flawless Pearl!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The pearl suddenly shone brightly, emitting rays of light and a surge of power that stopped Yi Tiannie's hand. Then, it repelled the blood restriction's light and snatched the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit, retreating rapidly.</p><p>Yi Tiannie was furious. He turned to see Cloud Wanderer still hiding in the corner, a Flawless Pearl floating in front of him, now slowly disappearing.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer, in his weakened state, had secretly maneuvered the Flawless Pearl to Yi Tiannie's side without him noticing!</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had also moved, rushing forward.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was quite surprised. He hadn't expected Cloud Wanderer to still have the strength to steal the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit. He had already resigned himself to giving it up.</p><p>Now it seemed that Cloud Wanderer's claim about the Three Lights Jade Liquid healing his hidden injuries was likely a ruse.</p><p>With just a few words, he had forced Yi Tiannie into a desperate situation.</p><p>Secretly astonished, Qin Sang had seen so many miraculous feats of the Flawless Pearl that he was almost numb to it.</p><p>He coldly watched Yi Tiannie, his eyes flashing with a chilling glint, as if looking at a dead man.</p><p>Yi Tiannie knew too many secrets and harbored deep hatred for him. He couldn't be allowed to live!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Ten Yama Banners stood firmly before Qin Sang, drawing in spiritual energy and Netherworld Devil Fire, spreading them widely.</p><p>'Sizzle...'</p><p>The lake water boiled, the lakebed instantly drying up.</p><p>Waves of fire surged within the stone chamber, sweeping towards Yi Tiannie, layer upon layer.</p><p>Yi Tiannie, having failed again, could only watch helplessly as the Flawless Pearl escaped with the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit. He cursed angrily but dared not pursue it.</p><p>He feared being entangled by Qin Sang, giving Cloud Wanderer time to recover and activate the Demon King's blood restriction again, using it against him like he had against the leopard.</p><p>Yi Tiannie looked at the overwhelming sea of fire. He was extremely familiar with the Ten Yama Banners and easily found a weak point in the flames, dashing through it.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The next moment, Yi Tiannie was flung back, his figure disheveled.</p><p>Then, an enraged roar came from the sea of fire, "How can your Corpse Core be so strong?!"</p><p>(Thanks to Starry Sky, Dragon Bound Wood, and Salty Bean Blessing for their generous gifts.</p><p>Thanks to everyone for your votes and support.</p><p>Thank you for your concern during the past period. I also appreciate the help from Brother Mou Lue and his wife. I've read and am working on your suggestions.</p><p>I've been recuperating lately. My uric acid levels have temporarily come down, and the gout has subsided. I'll definitely need to change my lifestyle and adjust as much as possible.)</p>
