Chapter 1861: Acquaintance


Torrential rain poured down.

Each clash between the combatants sent up massive sprays of water. Raindrops shattered into a misty fog, shrouding the two colossal figures locked in battle.  Their every move, every strike, generated a terrifying momentum.  Fortunately, this was within the illusory realm of the Altar of Governance.  Had this been any other place, the mountains and rivers would have already been shattered.

‘Splash!’

Water from the ground surged upwards.

The downpour seemed whipped by a gale, the rain slanting towards the battlefield, deepening the surrounding mist.  Only a slender figure could be vaguely seen, twisting and ascending, soaring upwards.

As a long tail lashed back and forth, rainwater was drawn in, forming a gigantic waterspout.

‘Rumble!’

The waterspout rose from the earth, and with a powerful flick of the fishtail, like the tail swing of a true dragon, it swept across the area with immense force.

Qin Sang, caught at the edge of the waterspout, felt the terrifying impact. His breath hitched, his feet planted firmly on the ground as his shoulders shuddered.

‘Bam!’

A heavy fist, like an iron hammer, struck the waterspout dead on.

The waterspout momentarily froze, two large holes appearing where the fist connected. The force of the blow erupted within the cavities, and the entire waterspout exploded. The rainwater that formed the dragon’s body, losing its support, cascaded down, creating a spectacular sight.

Qin Sang didn’t escape unscathed. His arms and hands throbbed with pain, his Qi and blood churned within him, his organs felt displaced. He staggered backward, his feet splashing in the water.

"Huff... Huff..."

Slightly calming his rapid breathing, Qin Sang sensed through his Spiritwood Body that the surrounding Wood Spirit Qi had significantly stagnated.

"Time to change the battlefield again..."

He muttered to himself, glancing at the two long tendrils whipping down from above. His expression instantly became wooden, the luster fading from his flesh as vitality receded.

His previous uses of the Shifting Art had been seamless, without any hindrance.

The Spiritmoor King didn’t have the power to influence the Wood Spirit Qi of the entire jungle realm.  If he couldn't prevent Qin Sang from shifting, confining him within the downpour, he wouldn't be able to stop him from absorbing the Wood Spirit Qi. The immense effort expended on his divine abilities would be in vain.

Qin Sang had been wary, speculating about the Spiritmoor King’s other methods. This time, he finally understood.

In the distance, the ancient tree Qin Sang had targeted saw its leaves turn yellow, its vitality rapidly fading.

At this moment, the Swallowing Seas Clam, which had been hovering above, solely manipulating the rain, suddenly turned, its opening aimed at the ancient tree.  White Qi swirled within its shell, flashing briefly.

Simultaneously, a cloud of dense water vapor gathered above the ancient tree, and with a whoosh, poured into its trunk.

The near-dead ancient tree surged with renewed vitality.  Its yellow leaves regained their green hue, and its bark became noticeably more hydrated.

‘Swish!’

Green leaves unfurled, branches grew.

The entire ancient tree came back to life and began to grow wildly, its crown overshadowing the surrounding spirit trees. It became even more lush and vibrant than before!

Unlike previously, only this single ancient tree underwent this transformation. The surrounding trees remained unchanged.

‘Thump! Thump! Thump!...’

The previously transformed Spiritwood Body suddenly stirred. Its features regained their animation, its stiff eyes moved, and shock filled its gaze.

At this moment, Qin Sang was forcibly pulled back from his shifting state. Then, he felt a sharp wind against his face as two bolts of lightning struck from either side.

Caught off guard, Qin Sang raised his right arm, hastily activating the Bright Mountain Armor. Fragments of the True Treasure coalesced on his forearm.

Sword light shot out from between his eyebrows, slashing towards the white tendril on the left.

‘Bang!’

‘Crack!’

The Cloud Wanderer Sword shot back, its light encircling him protectively.

Qin Sang staggered, retreating a dozen steps, subconsciously shaking his arm.

Although the True Treasure fragments could withstand the white tendrils, protecting him from being lashed, some force still penetrated, causing bursts of pain.

However, Qin Sang ignored this, staring intently at the Swallowing Seas Clam in the sky.

So this was how the Spiritmoor King countered the Shifting Art!

He would pinpoint the spirit tree Qin Sang targeted before the shift was complete, imbuing it with vitality, claiming its Wood Spirit Qi for his own use, and forcibly interrupting the Spiritwood Body’s transformation process.

This method seemed simple in theory.

The Spiritwood Body's shift was almost instantaneous. Unless one possessed incredibly keen spiritual senses, it was easy to misjudge.

One mistake, and all previous efforts would be wasted.

Qin Sang sensed that the Swallowing Seas Clam was connected to the water vapor in the void. It seemed that a strange power spread through the jungle space along with the vapor. Was this how the Spiritmoor King determined his shifting direction?

While Qin Sang observed the Swallowing Seas Clam, the Spiritmoor King didn't press his attack, instead pondering his previous strike. He, too, was experimenting, and it seemed to be highly effective.

Gradually, a confident smile spread across the Spiritmoor King’s face.

"This King hasn't enjoyed a battle like this in a long time.  Show me what other divine abilities you possess!"

His voice boomed like thunder.

The Spiritmoor King looked at Qin Sang as if he were a plaything.

The Spiritwood Body's two most potent divine abilities had been countered. Once completely suppressed, it would be equivalent to Qin Sang losing his geographical advantage entirely.

Qin Sang remained silent. With a thought, the sword light surrounding him paused, its tip tilting towards the sky.

A sword cry shook the heavens as sword light soared. It didn't slash towards the enemy but transformed into a streak of azure light, weaving through the air.

In the next instant, the sky darkened, plunging into night.

Countless stars hung high in the sky, their light radiating sharp sword intent.

The Seven Constellations Sword Formation!

The sword formation Qin Sang deployed this time was grander than ever before.  The deep, starry river was as vast as the real night sky!

However, vastness didn't necessarily equate to greater power.  It meant the sword momentum wasn't as concentrated, making it harder to control, especially against the discerning eyes of a Demon King.

In the Spiritmoor King’s eyes, this starry sky likely had numerous flaws, making it easy to locate the main star.

Furthermore, forcibly shattering the sword stars wouldn't be too difficult.

If he wished, escaping wouldn't be a problem.

However, Qin Sang's purpose in deploying this formation wasn't to trap the enemy.

As he ascended on his sword, his feet remained planted on the ground. The light in his eyes faded as he once again executed the Shifting Art.

The Blackfish manifestation raised its head, its gaze sweeping across the starry river, but it didn't act rashly.

He attempted the same tactic, and a scene similar to the previous one unfolded.

Outside the battlefield, an ancient tree withered without warning.  The Swallowing Seas Clam immediately shifted, its opening swirling with white Qi, a mass of water vapor condensing above the tree's crown.

Unexpectedly, before the condensation was complete, a sharp fluctuation erupted from within, as if lightning flashed. The water vapor instantly exploded and dispersed.

In that split second, the ancient tree lost all vitality. Qin Sang emerged from its trunk, his eyes narrowed, meeting the gloomy gaze of the Blackfish manifestation.

Within the sword formation, sword intent was omnipresent!

However, the water vapor was a manifestation of the Swallowing Seas Clam's power, not as ethereal as it appeared.  Even dispersing it wasn't an easy task.

The timing was also fleeting. A moment later, the ancient tree would have been infused with vitality, the Shifting Art interrupted.

He first had to pinpoint the core of the Swallowing Seas Clam's power and condense sufficiently strong sword intent in an instant to scatter the vapor and disrupt the Spiritmoor King’s plan.

Before comprehending Sword Heart’s Embrace, even within the sword formation, Qin Sang wouldn’t have been able to achieve this.

A cold snort echoed from the sky.

The torrential rain pursued him, and the Spiritmoor King's attack arrived, as fierce as before. Qin Sang had to devote all his energy to defending.

While relentlessly attacking Qin Sang, the Spiritmoor King employed several divine abilities and retrieved a scale-like treasure, continuously bombarding the starry sea.

The starry sky became chaotic.

"Bang! Bang! Bang..."

Beams of light occasionally tore through the starry sky, many sword stars exploding upon impact, countless others shifting out of place.

Large swathes of stars were even wiped out in a single strike.

But no matter how the Spiritmoor King manipulated his techniques, he couldn't destroy the sword formation. This formation, unlike ordinary spirit arrays, was a sword formation, with only one spirit sword and no other array tools.

Unless the Spiritmoor King could destroy the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

And the sword formation was inherently full of flaws. It wasn't meant to kill, so its destruction didn’t matter.

Two battlefields unfolded, one in the sky and one on the ground.  The celestial one was grander in scale, but the terrestrial one was the most perilous.

Soon, it was time to shift again.

Qin Sang employed the same tactic, and succeeded once more. But after another fierce exchange, the next shift failed!

Although he captured the core of the water vapor, he couldn't disperse it in time.

As time passed, the battlefield kept jumping.

Sometimes the shift succeeded, sometimes it failed. The two powerhouses, both at the pinnacle of Nascent Soul, caused the earth to collapse and mountains to crumble with every clash.

Who would have thought that their victory or defeat hinged on such minute contests?

If the Spiritmoor King could trap Qin Sang, he could neutralize the Spiritwood Body.

Qin Sang had a vague feeling that as long as he persevered, the Spiritmoor King wouldn't be able to overcome him, and the situation would eventually turn in his favor.

He didn't dare to say he could turn defeat into victory, but at least he could stalemate the Spiritmoor King.

The Spiritmoor King's power wasn't infinite.  Unless he summoned other demon cultivators for assistance, the Spiritmoor King would exhaust his strength before him, and the first to retreat would be him.

Perhaps, seeing the situation as hopeless, the Spiritmoor King would withdraw.

As a Demon King, he knew when to advance and retreat. He wouldn't fight to the death with a nameless junior over external possessions.

'Poof!'

The water vapor exploded.

Qin Sang successfully shifted once more, greedily absorbing Wood Spirit Qi, a sense of relief washing over him.

Recalling the previous clashes, Qin Sang wasn't optimistic.

He had truly witnessed the might of a Demon King.  Although the Spiritmoor King had suppressed his cultivation, his understanding of divine abilities and spells, and his exquisite control over power, left Qin Sang in awe.

In this level of confrontation, the Spiritmoor King's advantage was fully displayed.  Qin Sang had been deceived by the Spiritmoor King’s feints several times, missing valuable opportunities.

If not for the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly's assistance, the Spiritwood Body would likely have been neutralized.

Amidst the fierce battle, Qin Sang and the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly were rapidly improving, while the Spiritmoor King continuously experimented with various strategies.  The outcome remained uncertain.

Compared to the physical pain, what truly exhausted Qin Sang was the tremendous mental strain.  He had to remain fully focused, searching for a solution within the jungle realm.

Although he had other arrangements elsewhere, sufficient to deal with other enemies, against the Spiritmoor King, they would only buy him some time.

Once forced out of the jungle realm, Qin Sang would likely have to rely on the Flower Field Grand Formation to defend against the Spiritmoor King.

Even if he ultimately escaped, exposing the Flower Field was unacceptable to him.

Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to resort to that.

As soon as Qin Sang stepped out of the tree trunk, he was engulfed by the downpour.

The Blackfish manifestation lunged, its gaze flickering, the confidence in its heart beginning to waver.

The Spiritmoor King hadn't anticipated Qin Sang to be so tenacious. He no longer possessed absolute certainty of victory in this subtle contest.  He calculated that if this situation persisted, he only had a sixty percent chance of winning.

Before this, the Spiritmoor King wouldn't have imagined that his opponent could hold on for so long at the Hollow Profound stage.

Sixty percent.  Any unforeseen circumstance could influence the battle, even reverse the outcome.

It wasn’t time to retreat yet, as his opponent clearly only had the strength to defend.

The Spiritmoor King had left some markers on his way here. He wondered when Marquis Dingxiang and the others would arrive.

He didn't hold much hope. With the numerous illusory realms obstructing them, Marquis Dingxiang and the others likely wouldn't make it in time.

Thoughts flashed through his mind as the Spiritmoor King pondered silently, searching for Qin Sang's weaknesses while making calculations.

…

Outside the Heavenly Wall.

At the edge of the azure spiritual wind, a flickering figure clung to the wall, observing the battle below.

Zuo Zhenren concealed himself here, without a trace of his presence, taking in the entire battlefield.

He seemed quite familiar with the Spiritmoor King.  After a brief glance, he fixated on Qin Sang, primarily observing him.

When the Cloud Wanderer Sword appeared and deployed the sword formation, Zuo Zhenren diverted some of his attention to scrutinize it.

After observing for a long time, Zuo Zhenren watched the struggling Qin Sang, gently rubbing two fingers together. A符光 silently appeared, followed by a slight movement of his lips.

"What is your relationship with Zhijian?"

A voice, as faint as a mosquito's buzz, reached Qin Sang's ears.

Who’s there!

Qin Sang was startled.

A third party was watching!

He and the Spiritmoor King had chased each other here, and he hadn't seen a single soul along the way. He had assumed that the other cultivators and demon cultivators had been lured to the depths of the Altar of Governance.

With immense willpower, Qin Sang glanced at the Blackfish manifestation, noticing no change in its demeanor. It clearly hadn't detected the hidden presence.

"This person knows Realman Zhijian and transmitted a message to me first. It must be a human cultivator.  This person can conceal themselves from the Spiritmoor King’s perception.  Could it be a Grand Realman?"

Pondering silently, Qin Sang felt it was highly likely.

After a moment of thought, he extended a sliver of his divine sense to make contact. "May I know which senior has graced us with their presence?  This junior is Qing Feng. I cultivate on Sword Heart Island at the invitation of Fellow Daoist Zhijian, often seeking his guidance on swordsmanship. Fellow Daoist Zhijian is both a teacher and a friend to me..."

"Hehe..."

A chuckle reached his ears. "No wonder this poverty-stricken Daoist finds your swordsmanship somewhat familiar."

After this sentence, the voice fell silent.

Qin Sang's mind raced.

The other party had tacitly confirmed it. It was indeed a Grand Realman!

He had sought guidance from Realman Zhijian on swordsmanship and had inevitably been influenced by him.  Even if their sword techniques differed, traces of Realman Zhijian's style would inevitably appear in his swordsmanship.

This influence shouldn't have been so obvious, yet the other party had discerned it at a glance. This Grand Realman must be very familiar with Realman Zhijian.

Judging by their tone, they weren't enemies of Realman Zhijian.

Over the years, Qin Sang had always felt that Realman Zhijian was very mysterious, unfathomable. He hadn't expected him to have connections with a Grand Realman!

The Grand Realman remained silent, and Qin Sang didn't speak either, waiting for a response.

"This poverty-stricken Daoist is Zuo Fengdao. Perhaps you've heard of me, perhaps not... Since I've happened upon this scene, and I have some old grudges with this old demon, I might as well settle them together. Would you mind if I slay this fiend?" Zuo Zhenren said coldly.

"Senior wants this junior to be bait?"  Qin Sang's heart was instantly filled with vigilance.
