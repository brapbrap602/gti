Chapter 716: Corpse Pill


The Mixed Essence Concentric Rings tightened, causing the Azure Flood Dragon immense pain.
However, after receiving Qin Sang's promise, the Azure Flood Dragon seemed to forget its pain, staring intently at him with disbelief and hope in its fierce eyes.
Immediately, the Azure Flood Dragon swung its massive tail and chased after the direction Qin Sang pointed.
Qin Sang looked around, then activated his secret talismans and Sword Qi Thunder Sound, his escape light flickering several times before disappearing into the distance.  After flying for several miles, Qin Sang saw the figure of the Twin-Headed Wind Devil speeding across the water's surface.
Its front leg was injured, but with the help of its wind wings, it could still run swiftly on the water.
This Twin-Headed Wind Devil could create up to six illusory copies of itself, each indistinguishable from the real one, and inheriting a small portion of the original's power.  Without a real confrontation, it was impossible to tell the real one from the fake ones with the naked eye.
If it wanted to escape, it would be nearly impossible for the enemy to trap it.
Qin Sang was glad that he had injured the Twin-Headed Wind Devil first; otherwise, he would have lost it long ago.
Hearing the commotion behind it, the Twin-Headed Wind Devil's two heads turned left and right, staring fixedly at Qin Sang. Its vertical pupils suddenly brightened, and two beams of cyan light shot out, transforming into two whirling cyan wind blades.
They hurtled towards Qin Sang in a pincer attack.
"This is the real one!"
Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.
Facing these wind blades, he felt a stinging sensation on his skin, indicating the immense power of the wind blades. Illusions couldn't possess such a strong attack; this was indeed the true Twin-Headed Wind Devil.
But what delighted Qin Sang was that he discovered the Twin-Headed Wind Devil's aura had weakened again after performing this attack.  His strategy was finally paying off.
During this night of pursuit, Qin Sang had several opportunities to intercept the Twin-Headed Wind Devil. If he had spared no expense and used his secret talismans and Sword Qi Thunder Sound, the Twin-Headed Wind Devil wouldn't have been able to escape.
But he didn't do so. Instead, he trailed the Twin-Headed Wind Devil from a distance, not pressing too hard, making it think it had a chance to escape, but not giving it time to rest.
Under Qin Sang's repeated harassment, the already injured Twin-Headed Wind Devil was forced to overexert itself several times, using its supernatural powers to escape danger, and now it was finally reaching its limit.
As the wind blades approached, Qin Sang remained calm.
*Whoosh!*
The sword light surrounding Qin Sang flashed.
Thunder rumbled.
In the next moment, the Ebony Sword appeared in front of the wind blades. The sword's shadow flickered, splitting into two beams of sword light, one on the left and one on the right, meeting the two wind blades.
At the same time, Qin Sang raised his head and let out a long whistle, ordering the Azure Flood Dragon and the Sky-Soaring Yaksha to come quickly.
The time was ripe; it was time to close the net!
However, the Twin-Headed Wind Devil still possessed Core Formation mid-stage cultivation. Its final counterattack would undoubtedly be extremely fierce, and Qin Sang wasn't entirely confident.
Moreover, his goal was not to kill the Twin-Headed Wind Devil, but to capture it alive.
At this time, the Sky-Soaring Yaksha had just engaged with an illusion of the Twin-Headed Wind Devil. Hearing Qin Sang's whistle, it cleaved the illusion with a palm strike and turned to leave.  The Azure Flood Dragon, which had just spotted the Twin-Headed Wind Devil, hesitated upon hearing the whistle but ultimately chose to return as well.
*Boom!*
The wind blades and the spiritual sword collided, countless cyan fragments scattering.  The wind blades gradually dissipated.
The Ebony Sword trembled, emitting a sword cry, and broke free from the wind blades.  Its sword light flashed, shooting back to Qin Sang.
In this exchange, Qin Sang seemed to have a slight advantage.
To his surprise, after launching the wind blades, the Twin-Headed Wind Devil didn't flee. Instead, it turned to stare at him, its two vertical pupils flashing with ferocity.  Its heads lowered slightly, fangs bared, emitting low growls.
Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, knowing the Twin-Headed Wind Devil was about to fight to the death.
As soon as this thought crossed his mind, the Twin-Headed Wind Devil's body trembled.  Two illusions separated from it and suddenly vanished.
Qin Sang cursed inwardly and immediately retreated.
In the next instant, three Twin-Headed Wind Devils appeared where he had just been standing. If he hadn't reacted in time, he would have been caught off guard.
The Twin-Headed Wind Devil pressed its attack relentlessly.
Its wind wings trembled slightly and shattered, transforming into a vast expanse of wind blades.  At the same time, its true body and illusions lunged again.
Fortunately, the Azure Flood Dragon and the Sky-Soaring Yaksha had arrived.
Qin Sang deftly dodged the wind blades, pinpointed the Twin-Headed Wind Devil's true body, and ordered the Azure Flood Dragon and the Sky-Soaring Yaksha to tear apart the illusions.  Then, the three of them surrounded and attacked the Twin-Headed Wind Devil.
Its last struggle having failed, the Twin-Headed Wind Devil grew even weaker, losing even its wind wings.  Facing the siege, it couldn't defend itself on all sides and its situation worsened.
The Twin-Headed Wind Devil, unwilling to give up, launched several more counterattacks at the cost of its essence, all of which were easily neutralized by Qin Sang.
Finally, the Twin-Headed Wind Devil lost all hope.  It let out a mournful cry towards the sky, and one of its heads opened its mouth, a beam of cyan light shooting out.
Within the cyan light was a pill.
A Demon Pill!
The cyan light seemed incredibly tragic. The Demon Pill trembled, and an unusually powerful aura emanated from it.
The Twin-Headed Wind Devil was about to self-destruct its Demon Pill!
Facing this scene, Qin Sang showed no panic. He waved his hand, and three streaks of ghostly light shot out, striking the Twin-Headed Wind Devil. They instantly transformed into three giant ghost banners, flapping in the wind and waves.
For the past fifteen years, Qin Sang's life had been incredibly monotonous, consisting only of hunting demons and cultivating.
He had been focused on avoiding the conflict between the two races, so during these years, he not only hadn't returned but had ventured deeper into the Demon Sea, relying on the Mixed Essence Concentric Rings' warning function.
For fifteen years, he hadn't encountered a single cultivator.
Enduring this solitude wasn't difficult for him, dedicated as he was to cultivation.
While cultivating, he had been constantly thinking.
Before the next opening of the Seven Slaughters Hall, he should be able to break through to Core Formation mid-stage without any problems, but further breakthroughs to the late stage would definitely be impossible.
Without breaking through realms, further cultivation wouldn't be very effective after reaching Core Formation mid-stage.
How could he rapidly increase his strength to prepare for entering the Seven Slaughters Hall in the future?
Looking for alternative paths, the two most obvious options were to focus on body refinement or to cultivate his primordial spirit and strengthen his divine sense.
Among Qin Sang's past spoils, he had been fortunate enough to obtain similar techniques, but they were all mediocre, their effectiveness debatable, including the techniques stored in the Treasure Pagoda Peak of Lesser Hua Mountain, which offered little benefit to Core Formation cultivators.
Originally, if not for Duke Dongyang's scheme, Qin Sang would have returned to his sect, successfully formed his core, and gained access to Lesser Hua Mountain's most core collection, which presumably wouldn't lack such techniques.
Techniques for cultivating divine sense and body refinement were rare to begin with, and top-tier techniques were even scarcer. Qin Sang was unwilling to join other sects and be bound by their rules, so his opportunities to obtain such techniques were even fewer.
After much deliberation, Qin Sang decided to focus his attention elsewhere.
For instance, the Corpse Pill.
After forming his core, Qin Sang had always treated the Corpse Pill as a reserve. When his true essence was depleted, he could unseal the Corpse Pill and possess greater endurance than cultivators of the same realm.
Qin Sang felt that using the hard-earned Corpse Pill in this way was a bit of a waste. It should play a greater role to justify the hardships he had endured back then.
