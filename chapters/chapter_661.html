<h1>Chapter 653: The Li Witch Palace (Extra chapter for盟主 Mu Han!)</h1><p>“Brother Qin, may you become a celestial…”</p><p>Ya Gu closed her eyes, her breath rapidly fading.</p><p>“Sleep well, everything will be alright.”</p><p>Qin Sang said by her ear, no longer hesitating, he imprinted the Corpse Seal into Ya Gu’s soul space, then set up numerous restrictions.</p><p>Ya Gu fell into a deep sleep, but a lingering smile remained on her face, not deliberately created, but seemingly eternal, a subtle, hidden smile, like a clear night sky after the rain.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at her, suddenly feeling a heavy responsibility fall upon his shoulders.</p><p>He had cultivated for a hundred years, seen all kinds of people, many excellent women, yet never had any romantic attachments.</p><p>It wasn’t a lack of opportunity, but rather, he always chose to sever the ties himself.</p><p>Just as some promises are not easily made,</p><p>some responsibilities are hard to bear.</p><p>The Corpse Seal locked Ya Gu’s soul; whether he could later remove it, Qin Sang wasn't sure. He himself had become a Reanimated Corpse, and knew how evil the Corpse Seal was. If it weren't for a rare treasure like the Jade Buddha, he himself couldn't have undone it.</p><p>But Ya Gu's plight was largely due to him, and Qin Sang couldn't bear to watch her die before him. Since she had agreed, whether there was hope or not, he would do his best.</p><p>Thinking of Wu Shang, who had completely become a Reanimated Corpse in Wuya Valley, Qin Sang felt a sudden sense of urgency. Ya Gu's cultivation was too low; he didn't know how long she could hold on.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang joyfully discovered that the life force from the Three Lights Jade Liquid was still abundant. In Ya Gu's body, it was suppressing the corpse energy, protecting her body from becoming a corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. There were two major difficulties in the Reanimated Corpse restriction.</p><p>One was that the soul was imprisoned for too long, causing the intelligence in the soul to be destroyed. The other was the corpse transformation of the body. Once the corpse energy invaded the root, there would be no turning back, and the only option would be to seize another body.</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid had solved a major problem.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang quickly acted, sealing the medicinal power of the Three Lights Jade Liquid within Ya Gu’s body, using it only against the corpse transformation to avoid waste and prolong its duration as much as possible.</p><p>Then Qin Sang took out the Warm Soul Jade from his Qianjun Ring and placed it in Ya Gu's mouth.</p><p>This warm jade was obtained from Yi Tiannie; it could nourish the soul. Yi Tiannie was able to maintain his remnant soul because he was hidden within the warm jade.  Its effect was not as good as the Soul-Nurturing Wood, one of the ten divine trees, but it could still be of great help to Ya Gu.</p><p>These two rare treasures, combined, would buy Qin Sang ample time to study Corpse and Ghost Dao secret techniques, and to find a way to break the Corpse Seal.</p><p>The Witch Clan was also very adept at Corpse and Ghost Dao, and certainly had unique methods.</p><p>If he couldn't find a solution in the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang would have to return to Xiao Han Region urgently to search for the remains of the Celestial Corpse Sect and the latter half of the *Celestial Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang stood up and looked coldly in the direction of the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>The Five Insects Sect, the Li Witch Palace…</p><p>He had a feeling that the mystery of his teleportation was about to be solved.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang remembered the fat silkworm in the insect basket. A moment ago, the fat silkworm had suddenly become agitated, and was still relentlessly gnawing on the insect basket, but it didn't seem to be hungry.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what it was doing.</p><p>He opened the insect basket, and the fat silkworm scurried out, heading straight for Ya Gu in Qin Sang's arms.</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly moved and didn't stop the silkworm. He saw the silkworm crawl onto Ya Gu's hand and gently bite her finger.</p><p>The essence blood connected, and in that instant, a strange connection suddenly formed between the silkworm and Ya Gu.</p><p>“This is…a spirit insect voluntarily acknowledging a master?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished. He never expected such a rare event to happen to Ya Gu.</p><p>Why would the fat silkworm, meeting Ya Gu for the first time, acknowledge her as its master?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that the fat silkworm only became agitated after Ya Gu spoke; could it be because of her voice? Was her voice so beautiful that it could charm spirit insects?</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the fat silkworm, sensing that it had indeed acknowledged Ya Gu as its master, similar to a life-bound insect, but with significant differences.</p><p>“Could this guy be trying to escape my clutches, willing to acknowledge another master?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the fat silkworm's rolling, uncertain eyes with a strange look. He felt that if it was simply because of Ya Gu's voice, it was too absurd to capture a spirit insect.</p><p>Recently, the fat silkworm had been severely punished by his Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and couldn't even eat Red Fire Gilded Gold, so it probably wanted to run away, but lacked the ability to escape his grasp, only able to swallow its tears.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ya Gu was already asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang checked on Ya Gu, finding no change in her condition.  Her spirit insect, Qin Sang would have to take care of.  That clever fellow was outsmarted by his own cleverness; not only did he fail to escape, he got himself killed in the process.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Nine Nether Demon Fire to restrain the fat silkworm, giving it another beating. The fat silkworm cried, "hissing" in distress, pleading for its master's help, but receiving no response. Finally, its eyes glazed over, looking utterly despairing, before being tossed back into the insect basket by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang learned the location of the fight with Ya Gu: not far upstream from Qianhu Village; it hadn't been long ago. Ya Gu's injuries were severe. She'd been swept away by the fast-flowing river. Thankfully, his sword-energy's speed was exceptional; otherwise, it would have been hopeless.</p><p>Going upstream, Qin Sang quickly found the battlefield on a desolate mountain ridge by the Green Robe River. The explosive force of the Devouring Yuan Cone was limited; the mountain ridge wasn't severely damaged.  Qin Sang immediately saw two bodies lying on the ground, and severed limbs and flesh scattered amongst the surrounding vegetation.</p><p>The cultivator with the surname Tong was in the worst shape; his lower body was almost completely gone. Although he'd avoided vital areas, he hadn't escaped the poison needles. The deadly poison had already claimed his life.</p><p>The other person was indeed a stranger. Qin Sang used his divine sense to scan him, detecting a faint life sign.  Poisoned by the Black Jiao, he hadn't died instantly, but he wasn't in much better condition. His skin was almost black and purple. Without help, he would surely die.</p><p>Qin Sang went to the man's side and slipped an antidote pill into his mouth. Soon, the poison was neutralized, and the man gradually recovered, eventually waking up to find a stranger.</p><p>"Who are you…?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent and coldly placed a hand on his forehead.  Soul-searching! Qin Sang, fearing the man's weakened body couldn't endure the pain, administered the antidote first.</p><p>After a heart-wrenching scream, the man fell silent. Qin Sang withdrew his hand, a look of surprise and murderous intent on his face.</p><p>…</p><p>The Five Insects Sect was in ruins.  The mountain was littered with rubble, broken stones, and shattered wood, the aftermath of a great battle.  The sect's protective formation was activated, yet surprisingly, it remained intact.  In the debris, many corpses of Five Insects Sect disciples lay scattered about, a strong smell of blood filling the air, their bodies left unburied.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to Mu Han for the leader support!</p><p>Thank you everyone for your votes and donations!</p>
