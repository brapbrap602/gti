<h1>Chapter 2046: The Foundation</h1><p>Qin Sang followed instructions.  He saw Master Luo Hua cast the Barrier-Free Seal, splitting it into six beams of incantation light, one of which shot towards him.</p><p>Suppressing his instincts, Qin Sang allowed the light to fall upon him. He felt a strange spiritual energy enter his body.  When he tried to grasp it, the energy dissipated.</p><p>Vaguely, Qin Sang sensed a connection forming between himself and Master Luo Hua.  This connection was subtle, like a channel opening between them, but Qin Sang felt no constraint or manipulation.</p><p>Master Luo Hua stopped, quietly observing everyone.</p><p>The group focused their senses for a moment, then opened their eyes. They confirmed that the Barrier-Free Seal posed no significant hindrance, at least not in a way that Master Luo Hua could control them. They calmed themselves, but remained vigilant, awaiting further orders.</p><p>Master Luo Hua nodded.  “Everyone, please refine the materials before you according to the established method!”</p><p>With that, Master Luo Hua gently shook the whisk in his hand.  The tassels unfurled, countless silver threads shooting downwards. Some clung to the refining furnace, others pierced the platform.  Everyone saw only a dazzling silver light, obscuring everything within.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed briefly that he couldn't perceive the presence of the spiritual treasure. He wasn't worried; if Master Luo Hua needed their help in refining it, he would eventually reveal it.</p><p>He looked at the spiritual object before him and, without hesitation, drew it closer.</p><p>It was a chicken egg-sized, perfectly round white stone, called the Turbid Wave Stone.</p><p>Legend says that from its birth, the Turbid Wave Stone first forms a cocoon-like outer shell.  Once the interior develops to a certain point, it forms a second shell, and so on. Each new shell represents increased purity, eventually resulting in numerous thin shells surrounding the most refined spiritual energy within.</p><p>The shells are incredibly fragile. Once broken, the spiritual energy dissipates immediately, the same during refinement.  There's no way to slow or preserve it.  Therefore, refining this object requires first transforming the layers of shells into an invisible force that encloses the spiritual energy without hindering the refinement process.</p><p>At Luo Hua Temple, Qin Sang had already learned the properties of these treasures and was adept at refining them.</p><p>Before him, the Turbid Wave Stone's shells were peeled away layer by layer, each with unique patterns, as changeable as ocean waves.</p><p>He proceeded methodically, without a single mistake, until the white stone vanished, leaving only a single ‘drop’ of liquid.  An invisible membrane seemed to envelop this droplet.</p><p>He carefully moved it aside and summoned the next object, refining each one in turn.</p><p>In the midst of his work, Qin Sang sensed something, paused slightly, and looked towards the furnace.  He saw that Master Luo Hua had, at some point, put away the whisk, and the platform and furnace felt completely different.</p><p>“It’s an ingenious spiritual array.  The furnace receives a huge boost from the array. I wonder if this array is versatile or only compatible with this furnace?”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the platform, his thoughts forming. He could tell that this furnace was extraordinary.</p><p>Most alchemists and artifact refiners have their own special furnaces or cauldrons to enhance their work. Qin Sang mused that he had yet to find a suitable one and should start searching for his own.</p><p>He thought of the green bronze piece obtained from the Purple Micro Palace. Its original form might have been a cauldron or a furnace, and it might provide some inspiration.</p><p>The extraneous thought quickly passed, pushed aside as Qin Sang focused on refining.</p><p>Then, Master Luo Hua swept his gaze around.  When everyone had finished refining, he flicked his whisk, showering down points of clear light.</p><p>‘Clang clang clang…’</p><p>The platform array activated, and the furnace vibrated violently.</p><p>“Everyone, immediately enter a state of meditative emptiness!” Master Luo Hua ordered again.  Simultaneously, the platform emitted brilliant light, six beams enveloping the group.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a deep meditative state.  Immediately, he felt the power of the spiritual array descend, engulfing him in light.</p><p>Master Luo Hua’s expression was serious. He held his whisk in one hand and made seals with the other, chanting incantations, finally letting out a low shout as he pressed his palm downwards.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, still in meditation, felt the Barrier-Free Seal emanate a strange fluctuation. It wasn't his own, yet it harmonized perfectly with his energy.  This fluctuation subtly guided him towards a task.</p><p>If he had resisted, he could have suppressed it, but that would have affected the refinement.</p><p>He didn't interfere, observing as his hands automatically formed a hand seal, a secret technique he had never practiced, yet flawlessly performed.</p><p>Others experienced the same sensation as Qin Sang, but each person's hand seal was different.  They all simultaneously directed their seals towards the platform.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A powerful beam of light shot into the sky, threatening to tear open the heavens.</p><p>Outside the refining chamber, the Luohua Mountain cultivators stood ready, using spells to mask the fluctuations in spiritual energy.</p><p>Awakening from their meditative state, everyone felt a change. They seemed to have become masters of the high platform spirit array, feeling a closer connection to the refining furnace. However, each person could only control a single sub-array; the true master remained  Master Luohua.</p><p>Master Luohua's breath was slightly erratic, clearly indicating that guiding six people in simultaneous spellcasting was no easy feat. And this was only the beginning; more challenges lay ahead.</p><p>After a moment of closed-eye meditation, Master Luohua gave another command, and Qin Sang and the others activated their respective sub-arrays.</p><p>The array's purpose was to assist in the refinement process.  Only those with a profound understanding of the art of refinement could fully utilize its power. Qin Sang had no such worries; he silently activated the array, drawing in a mass of refined spiritual essence.</p><p>Upon entering the array, the spiritual essence was immediately divided by the array's power, transforming into strands of refined qi. Guided by the array, it underwent another transformation before finally merging into the refining furnace.</p><p>The others performed the same actions. Master Luohua bore the heaviest responsibility, carefully refining the spiritual treasure to avoid damaging its spiritual essence while guiding the orderly refinement of the essences into the furnace.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's heart stirred; he finally sensed the spiritual treasure within the furnace.</p><p>An image appeared in his mind: a jade ruler, floating serenely in the flames. The ruler was quite heavy, less than a foot long, with a white surface and an inner glow of bluish-green.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly sensed a nascent spiritual entity gestating within the jade ruler.</p><p>The spiritual treasure was on the verge of transformation.  Judging its spiritual essence—difficult to compare without Xiao Wu—it was almost as potent as the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>Could this mean the Yunyou Sword was also about to transform?</p><p>Having explored its development alone, without reference, Qin Sang wasn't sure of the Yunyou Sword's progress.  Since being imbued with essence and enlightened by Ziwei Tongzi, nearly six hundred years had passed. It was finally time for it to manifest a spirit!</p><p>Perhaps the Yunyou Sword could even surpass Xiao Wu.</p><p>Because the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* was entangled with too much karma, the Yunyou Sword, upon becoming a postnatal spiritual treasure, could not be easily used in battle, and might not provide much assistance to Qin Sang. Yet, with its true spirit embodied, whether Yunyouzi could be reborn through it would finally be revealed!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, but his actions remained unaffected. Sensing Master Luohua's urging, he increased the array's speed.</p><p>Various refined spiritual essences flowed into the furnace, creating flames of different colors. Under Master Luohua's control, the power of the spiritual fire intensified. Finally, a glaze appeared on the surface of the jade ruler, a sign of melting.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Luohua Temple's treasure refining techniques were far more intense than Qin Sang and the others had imagined. Master Luohua once again guided everyone in employing a secret technique. A deafening boom echoed from the furnace. When Qin Sang emerged from his meditative state, he found the jade ruler had completely shattered into dust.  Astonishingly, the nascent spiritual entity remained unharmed.</p><p>The furnace mouth erupted in raging flames, engulfing Master Luohua in firelight.</p><p>Knowing they had reached the most critical moment, everyone focused their minds, striving to assist Master Luohua in maintaining the energy of the dust and refining the various essences. As time passed, the spiritual essences surrounding them were almost depleted.</p><p>Master Luohua again activated the Wu Zhang Seal. This time, it lasted longer than before, and the technique used was far more complex.</p><p>Qin Sang felt seals emanating from him.  Remaining in meditation, he could only sense the existence of the spiritual entity, unaware of the jade ruler's transformation.</p><p>After an indeterminate amount of time, Qin Sang suddenly perceived a change in the nascent spiritual entity. It seemed as if a life form was gestating within; the once chaotic spiritual essence was undergoing a transformation, about to give birth to true consciousness.</p><p>It was like a seed sprouting, at the very beginning of germination.</p><p>"How did Master Luohua do it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was intensely curious, but he couldn't make any movement, lest he disrupt the Wu Zhang Seal.</p><p>Perhaps Master Luohua had refined unknown spiritual materials, but it was certainly closely related to this secret technique.  Unfortunately, the portion of the technique performed through Qin Sang's hands was only a part. Even if he discussed it with Madame Shuanghua and others later, he wouldn't be able to deduce the complete technique because only Master Luohua knew its key.</p><p>Such a sect's closely guarded secrets could not be passed on. Qin Sang could only wait for the jade ruler's completion, hoping to gain significant insights from the incomplete technique.</p><p>The birth of spiritual essence was a very long process.</p><p>Everyone forgot time, as still as statues.  Only the flickering flames illuminated the refining chamber.</p><p>Six months passed unnoticed.</p><p>Outside the refining chamber, numerous Luohua Sect cultivators formed a protective formation, maintaining a vigil.  After the initial period of intense energy fluctuations from within the chamber, an unusual calm settled.</p><p>"Why is there still no reaction from inside?  I wonder what stage of the refinement process they're at…"</p><p>Bored, the cultivators within the formation exchanged messages through spiritual sense.</p><p>"The Sect is being so cautious; what's so strange about it taking a year or two?"</p><p>Another cultivator shook his head, about to speak further, when his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>Simultaneously, everyone felt it, their gazes snapping towards the refining chamber. Instinctively, they pushed the protective formation to its limits, a thick haze isolating the chamber from the outside world.</p><p>Inside the refining chamber, everyone was startled awake. The moment Qin Sang opened his eyes, he didn't look at the refining furnace, but at Master Luohua.</p><p>Master Luohua looked pale and exhausted.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned his surroundings; finding no trace of the remaining spiritual materials, he sighed and turned his attention back to the furnace.</p><p>At that moment, Master Luohua also ceased all actions.</p><p>Everyone sensed that the spirit embryo within the furnace had reached a critical juncture, a crucial step.  Success would mean a revolutionary transformation!</p><p>In an instant, the spirit embryo emitted a powerful surge of energy.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The spiritual flames within the furnace flared and condensed erratically.</p><p>The spirit embryo's vibrations intensified.  It felt as if a consciousness within was desperately trying to break free from its shell and be reborn!</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang tilted his head, his gaze seemingly piercing the ceiling and reaching the heavens. He sensed a familiar aura gathering, imbued with celestial might – the aura of a Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>Others felt it too.  Master Quan's face lit up with excitement.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation was brewing.  Could it be succeeding?</p><p>Outside the refining chamber, the Luohua Sect cultivators were in an uproar.</p><p>A Heavenly Tribulation was impossible to conceal. While it was still in its nascent stages, its aura was faint enough to be barely masked by the formation. However, once the Heavenly Tribulation descended, all cultivators in Yanling City would sense it.</p><p>But, once the spirit was born and drew down the tribulation, there would be no need for concealment!</p><p>"I wonder what form the spiritual treasure's Heavenly Tribulation will take?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Master Luohua, but found him to be the calmest.  A thought struck him: could something else be happening?</p><p>As soon as this thought occurred, Qin Sang saw a flicker of regret in Master Luohua's eyes.</p><p>The next moment, the spiritual flames within the furnace suddenly contracted, and the abundant spiritual energy exploded—not in transformation, but in an explosion caused by an overload.  Chaotic energy gushed out from the furnace mouth.</p><p>The aura of the Heavenly Tribulation instantly dissipated.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Master Quan cried out in disbelief at the outcome.</p><p>It had failed!</p><p>Even though Qin Sang and the others were not Luohua Sect cultivators, they couldn't help but feel regret.  This might have been their only chance in life to "witness" the refinement of a postnatal spiritual treasure.</p><p>"It seems we acted too hastily. Our foundations were insufficient, and our efforts came to naught."</p><p>Master Luohua sighed, his true essence forming a large hand that reached into the furnace, dispelling the chaotic energy and retrieving the jade ruler.  Though the transformation had failed, the jade ruler wasn't destroyed, but its spiritual energy was greatly depleted, and it would likely take a long time to recover.</p><p>All the spiritual materials were wasted, rendering the Luohua Sect's elaborate planning futile and dealing a major blow to the morale of its cultivators.</p><p>"The Sect prepared for so long, how could it fail! How… how could this happen…" Master Quan couldn't accept it, his gaze filled with worry as he looked at Master Luohua.</p><p>"Brother Quan, do not despair. Even though we failed this time, I still have another chance. However, there will be no turning back next time; it will be a desperate gamble. These fellow Daoists are trustworthy and have no ties to those factions. Once you become Sect Master, remember to maintain contact with them; they will be valuable external support."</p><p>Master Luohua sent a comforting message through spiritual sense, then dispelled the protective barrier surrounding everyone, announcing aloud, "Thank you all for your assistance.  Please return to your respective sects to rest and recover."</p><p>Everyone felt a sense of relief, as if a burden had been lifted. They looked at each other, seeing Master Luohua's calm demeanor, unsure of how to offer comfort.</p><p>Master Tonghu bowed, "This setback is not what we desired. Should your Sect wish to refine this treasure again in the future, please inform us; we will certainly come to assist, without asking for any reward!"</p><p>Everyone echoed his sentiments. Qin Sang nodded silently, pondering Master Luohua's earlier words.</p><p>"Insufficient foundations… what does that mean? Xiao Wu was born from a demonic child, swallowed it, and was then enlightened by the Ziwei Boy.  Yunyou Sword benefited even more from the Ziwei Boy.  Are their foundations insufficient?"</p>
