<h1>Chapter 973: A Plea for Life</h1><p>Events unfolded rapidly, all under the watchful eyes of the Nine-Phoenix King, leaving little opportunity to examine this object.</p><p>Qin Sang held the scale, wrapping it in true energy to keep it at a distance before attempting to infuse it with his own true energy.</p><p>Suddenly, the scale vibrated slightly, and a faint image materialized.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, secretly on guard.  Unexpectedly, it was a miniature dragon, about the size of his palm, remarkably similar to the dragon image summoned by Yuan Zhu earlier, only much smaller, like a sliver of a soul.</p><p>“You actually survived!”</p><p>The dragon spirit's eyes mirrored Yuan Zhu's, its gaze fixed on Qin Sang. Its voice was deep and resonant.</p><p>“You are Yuan Zhu’s remnant soul?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, his mind racing.  Hearing Yuan Zhu's words, he suddenly realized something, his heart jolting. “You know I’m an imposter?”</p><p>There was no need for concealment now, Qin Sang stated directly.</p><p>Yuan Zhu chuckled coldly, “You really thought you hid your human identity so well? Those Xuanjia talismans were bound to each person's blood essence. Even if no one had ever seen the Biqiu Saint Son, exposing you wouldn't have been difficult. If I hadn't covered for you, you would've long been discovered by Gu Heng and Caiyi. However, I couldn’t have helped you without your skill at deception. Since you managed to create such a convincing disguise, I simply played along...”</p><p>Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>He hadn’t been without suspicions. From the start, Yuan Zhu had been unusually enthusiastic, revealing everything before Qin Sang could even ask, giving him ample time to fabricate excuses.</p><p>Even noticing these inconsistencies, Qin Sang felt helpless.</p><p>The situation was overwhelming. Yuan Zhu remained at his side, while Gu Heng and Caiyi's strengths were comparable to his own, leaving him no chance to escape, so he could only remain vigilant.</p><p>Later, seeing the lack of aggression from the other beasts, who treated him as one of their own, Qin Sang began to question his suspicions.</p><p>Now, he realized Yuan Zhu had planned this from the beginning.  Before Gu Heng and the others arrived, he revealed his identity as a transformed great demon to intimidate Qin Sang, preventing any rash actions.</p><p>Then, he used that window of time to subtly guide him, truly a master manipulator.</p><p>“If you dared to act, the outcome would still be uncertain!”</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted.</p><p>He hadn’t expected a demon beast at the Yao Dan stage to be able to transform, assuming he was facing a Transformation Stage great demon, and thus acting cautiously.</p><p>If Yuan Zhu had revealed his true nature earlier, Qin Sang would have acted without hesitation. At that time, Gu Heng and the others hadn't arrived, and escape may have been possible.</p><p>“You saved my life to have me retrieve this scale?  Your true form is dead, this remnant soul will soon dissipate. Could you use this soul to restore your true body?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind raced; there was only one possible reason why Yuan Zhu would help him infiltrate the demon clan.</p><p>However, the soul power of the remnant soul Yuan Zhu left behind was extremely weak, not even a true remnant soul, unlike Bai who was able to recover by possessing a corpse. It was impossible.</p><p>“Who says my true form is dead?”</p><p>The dragon shadow said calmly, “I had long been planning for this; how could I not have precautions?  However, I didn't expect those demon kings to be so ruthless. Not only did they treat us as expendable pawns, but they also left insidious measures to prevent rebellion, rendering all my previous preparations useless. Gu Heng and Caiyi are likely not to survive. It's fortunate that my impromptu move to leave a remnant soul with you proves to be the key.”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Yuan Zhu, somewhat surprised. “My friend, what a masterful move, to survive this situation. However, since your true body is unharmed, what is the meaning of leaving this remnant soul with me?”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Yuan Zhu said: “My true form wouldn't have died at the hands of the Nine-Phoenix King, but I would have been severely wounded, engulfed in flames, and swept away by the storm.  I don't know how long I could have lasted.  Ironically, while my plan was to escape the hurricane should I fail to kill the Nine-Phoenix King, it instead put me in greater danger. Luckily, I left this remnant soul with you to save my true form…”</p><p>“You want me to save your true form?  You wouldn't understand the saying, ‘those of different races will always have different hearts.’ Humans and demons are sworn enemies; why should I save you?”</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have heard the funniest joke in the world.</p><p>“It is true that I had my own calculations, but I also saved you from a fatal ambush and warned you at the last moment, allowing you to prepare. Otherwise, you would not have escaped so easily.  We're even now.”</p><p>We have no blood feud, nor any deep-seated conflict stemming from our different lineages…"</p><p>Yuan Zhu's expression was gloomy.  "Do you still consider me a member of the demon race? From now on, this vast world offers me no refuge, I am utterly alone."</p><p>Qin Sang was silent,  thinking of Yuan Zhu's plight and recalling her own escape from the Yuanzhao Sect.</p><p>Both of us were betrayed, both struggling to survive.</p><p>But Yuan Zhu's situation is far more dire. I could seek refuge with the righteous cultivators, but he is abandoned by his own kind, unable to integrate into human society, and further burdened by an unbreakable magical restriction that prevents his cultivation from progressing.</p><p>His future is bleak, devoid of any hope.</p><p>The thought is utterly despairing!</p><p>Yuan Zhu continued, "You must be worried about finding your way out of the storm zone, right?  My soul-splitting technique allows me to sense my main body's location within a certain range. I've discovered an ancient cultivator's abode in the storm zone.  It's possible to use the abode's formations to determine direction. My main body will also try to move towards the abode. If you rescue my main body quickly, I will guide you out of the storm zone…"</p><p>"An ancient cultivator's abode?"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>The storm zone in the Canglang Sea is much like the Ancient Immortal Battlefield in the Xiao Han region. Cultivators in Xiao Han frequently discover ancient relics there, and naturally, similar places exist in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>However, this is a boundless ocean, and the number of surviving ancient abodes is extremely small.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the constant hurricanes, most ancient abodes have long since crumbled under the relentless assault of the storms, their protective formations failing and their existence vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Finding an ancient abode is far more difficult than in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield; it’s been a long time since anyone discovered one.</p><p>Because of this, the storm zone surrounding the Canglang Sea is far vaster than the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, yet the cultivators here haven't found much of value, making it seem poorer than Xiao Han.</p><p>That Yuan Zhu could discover an ancient abode here, and from his tone, one where the protective formations are still intact, usable as a dwelling – it is truly remarkable fortune.</p><p>There could be no more hidden abode.</p><p>…</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>The 仙禁 incident  alarmed many cultivators.</p><p>Yuan Ying stage experts searched everywhere, but any trace was erased by the Xianjin power, leaving almost no clues to determine the perpetrator's identity or intentions.</p><p>With no useful information, most dispersed, leaving only a few Yuan Ying cultivators still searching.</p>
