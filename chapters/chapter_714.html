<h1>Chapter 706: Shadow of the Insects</h1><p>Chapter 706: Shadow of the Insects</p><p>When the five individuals on the other side of the light barrier realized something was amiss, Qin Sang and the thin, elderly cultivator had already finished their fight. The elderly cultivator had perished in the demonic flames, while Qin Sang was unharmed.  By the time they burst out, the battle was over.</p><p>After killing the cultivator, Qin Sang retreated swiftly. The elderly cultivator's body was quickly consumed by the Nine Netherworld demonic flames, leaving only ashes on the ground.</p><p>Witnessing this, the others’ faces changed drastically. They immediately summoned their magical weapons, aiming them at Qin Sang as if he were a great demon.</p><p>"What are you doing? Why did you kill him?"</p><p>The short, stout cultivator roared, glaring at Qin Sang.</p><p>The others were equally shocked.  Separated by the light barrier, they hadn't heard the conversation between Qin Sang and the elderly cultivator.  They were unclear about the situation, stunned that the usually taciturn Qin Sang had suddenly attacked a companion.  Cultivators at this level often had blood on their hands, but killing someone without provocation outside the cave was unexpected.</p><p>They were also shocked by Qin Sang's strength – he had instantly killed a cultivator of the same level!</p><p>They themselves weren’t confident in easily defeating the thin, elderly cultivator.  Didn’t this mean that if Qin Sang wanted to kill any of them, he easily could?</p><p>Qin Sang distanced himself, his expression unchanged. A swirling chill then brought forth two flying night yakshas to his sides, like guardians, confronting the five.</p><p>Seeing the fierce appearance of the flying night yakshas, the others gasped. They finally understood why the elderly cultivator had died so quickly, almost without resisting.</p><p>These two flying night yakshas were terrifying. One possessed an aura comparable to a true Golden Core cultivator, the other was slightly weaker but still a significant force.</p><p>Coupled with Qin Sang's control over the strange demonic flames, a sudden attack from Qin Sang and the yakshas would force even a mid-Golden Core cultivator to flee.</p><p>"Daoist Qin…"</p><p>The scholar in green swallowed, cautiously asking, "What exactly happened? We're at the Yuan Ying cave entrance, about to enter. Whatever the conflict, why couldn't it be resolved peacefully? Why resort to such violence?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, his gaze cold as he swept across the five faces.</p><p>If the elderly cultivator had accomplices, the short, stout cultivator was the most likely candidate. The other four were also suspicious, cunning individuals who hid their intentions well, escaping Qin Sang's notice.</p><p>Having witnessed Qin Sang kill the elderly cultivator, fear gripped them, turning Qin Sang into their biggest enemy. Words alone wouldn't explain, nor would it gain their trust.</p><p>Even with his strength, Qin Sang couldn't challenge them all.</p><p>He had already sent a signal; staying in the cave would lead to being trapped. Explaining would be a waste of time.</p><p>He guessed the elderly cultivator's accomplices weren't overwhelmingly powerful, otherwise, they wouldn't have used such a deceptive tactic.</p><p>However, the cave was narrow, restricting the use of talismans; moreover, mutual suspicion existed among the group. He couldn't distinguish friend from foe, making a one-on-one fight impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang's biggest concern was the strange chill in the cave. He suspected it was connected to a powerful spiritual fire. If someone could control it, killing them would be effortless.</p><p>He wouldn't stand on the edge of a cliff.</p><p>Leaving the cave first would provide him more advantage. Once the elderly cultivator’s accomplices arrive, he'd reassess the situation.</p><p>Treasures were tempting, but only if one lived to claim them.  Besides, the presence of treasure wasn't certain. This place felt more like a dangerous lure, a hunting ground!</p><p>This thought brought a smile to Qin Sang's face, which the others perceived as a demonic grin, especially in this environment, causing fear.</p><p>Two female cultivators trembled slightly as they gripped their magical weapons.</p><p>"Daoist Lan, in the spirit of our alliance, I must warn you."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured to the elderly cultivator's ashes, "This man, using the chaos caused by the broken light barrier, secretly sent a signal, contacting someone. Fortunately, I noticed it. If you're in league with him, consider this unsaid."</p><p>If not, think carefully.  We're weakened by the chilling mist, struggling to break the barrier.  Imagine what would happen if someone ambushed us here…”</p><p>Qin Sang remained unconcerned, her expression calm.</p><p>Qing Shan Ru Sheng and the others’ faces shifted, their doubt evident.  They subconsciously began to guard against the short, stout cultivator. After all, he was the instigator, the most likely suspect.</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>The stout cultivator sharply interrupted Qin Sang, shouting, “Don’t listen to this demon’s lies!  This is clearly a ploy to kill and silence witnesses, spread chaos, and steal the treasure! Don’t fall for it! We should kill him first; five of us, we have nothing to fear…”</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, disdaining to argue.</p><p>“I’ve said my piece. I'm leaving!”</p><p>Before her words faded, Qin Sang gestured, recalling her flying night fork. Then, with the sound of a dragon's roar emanating from within her, she transformed into a streak of light and sped away, vanishing into the chilling mist, leaving the others staring after her in bewilderment.</p><p>The mist swirled as a figure emerged, landing on a branch of an ancient tree at the edge of the hills.  As soon as he appeared, a brilliant azure hue materialized in the air before him, revealing the exquisite form of the Tianmu butterfly.</p><p>A gentle smile graced Qin Sang’s face.  One hand supported the butterfly, while the other gently stroked it, offering encouragement.</p><p>“Insect Shadow?”</p><p>After communicating with her spirit insect, Qin Sang obtained more precise information: the withered old man had released a spirit insect, Insect Shadow, which flew to a high altitude and then disappeared.</p><p>“They're communicating via spirit insects. It sounds like a Witch tribe technique.  Similar to the Qingfu coins, but less discreet; it seems to require overcoming the interference of the mist. These six are all human cultivators. Could someone be collaborating with the Witch tribe to harm their own kind?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, gazing out at the surrounding sea.</p><p>The sky was a brilliant blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds—everything appeared normal.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s gaze sharpened. She stared intently at a distant point in the northern sky. A white cloud was rapidly approaching.  Its speed across the cloudscape was astonishing.  Qin Sang’s expression changed dramatically.</p><p>Suspecting the cloud concealed the withered old man’s accomplices, though unsure of their number, Qin Sang knew she couldn't stay. She leaped, activating a talisman, and sped off in another direction.</p>
