<h1>Chapter 1881: Control</h1><p>Chapter 1881: Control</p><p>Everyone understood that now wasn't the time to settle accounts with the Jiao Dragon King.</p><p>The crimson barrier clearly originated from the blood coffin, the work of the Ancient Demon himself.  What scheme did the Ancient Demon have in bringing them here?</p><p>The situation was incredibly unpredictable.</p><p>The sword energy and the power of the blood coffin had merged, emitting terrifying fluctuations that sent shivers down their spines. No one dared approach the high platform.  It seemed like a stalemate, with no one knowing who would ultimately prevail.</p><p>If the sword energy were extinguished by the blood light, they would face the Ancient Demon directly, and it was likely that no one present would survive.  The entire Canglang Sea might even be thrown into chaos.</p><p>Everyone's gaze shifted to the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul.</p><p>They saw that the fragmented soul was standing next to Qingzhu, and Qingzhu's state was rather strange.</p><p>……</p><p>From the moment they were pulled into this space, the instant Qingzhu appeared, the demonic energy emanating from the blood coffin surged into Qingzhu's body.</p><p>The clarity in Qingzhu's eyes vanished instantly, replaced by bewilderment, yet their aura steadily rose.</p><p>At this moment, Qingzhu's demonic soul was under the control of the Ancient Demon.</p><p>Qingzhu had been suppressing their demonic soul, on the verge of reclaiming their body.  All their efforts were instantly destroyed and came to naught by the Ancient Demon.</p><p>With their body under the Ancient Demon's control, Qingzhu's original self was powerless to resist.</p><p>"As expected!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragmented soul glanced at Qingzhu. He had guessed that the reason his demonic restriction had failed was because the Ancient Demon had interfered.</p><p>He turned his head, staring at the blood coffin, and angrily rebuked the Ancient Demon, "You still don't trust me!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon was using a secret technique, forcibly infusing Qingzhu with demonic energy.</p><p>He had just forcibly activated the grand formation, consuming a great deal of energy. If this demonic energy were given to him, his strength would immediately skyrocket.</p><p>"Nonsense!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragmented soul heard the Ancient Demon's urgent and angry roar, "I'm consuming the Sacred Coffin's essence. Quickly kill them, set up the Blood River Formation, and defile the sword energy. This sword energy has also been eroded by time, it's not what it once was. These people are barely enough. Otherwise, if the sword energy strikes, you and I will both be reduced to ashes!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragmented soul was startled. Sensing the sword energy's aura, a hint of fear appeared on his face.</p><p>……</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing that no one was paying attention to him, quietly moved to the edge of the crimson barrier.</p><p>The young man and woman were not far from Qin Sang.  Following their master's orders, they were, like Qin Sang, cautiously hiding in a corner, not daring to breathe heavily.</p><p>Once the great battle began, even a stray ripple could cost them their lives.</p><p>Qin Sang exchanged a glance with them, saying nothing, secretly communicating with Bai, inquiring about Ya Gu's condition and discussing countermeasures.</p><p>"That girl really went all out.  She's now in a deep coma, seemingly lifeless. Fei Can is slightly better, only suffering from exhaustion and is currently sleeping within her body."</p><p>Bai sighed, "Originally, if the Heavenly Corpse Talisman was undone, she had a high chance of waking up, but it's hard to say now.  Luckily, you fed her the Soul Cleansing Liquid, along with the Jade Liquid of Life and the Soul-Nurturing Wood. At least the situation won't worsen. It's up to her fate...How did you run into so many dangerous people again?"</p><p>Bai's tone was filled with anger and even despair.</p><p>Qin Sang was also worried.</p><p>He touched the crimson barrier, only to realize that it wasn't actually there. It seemed to be a manifestation of a mysterious boundary-type secret technique.  Seeing that the Demon Lord and others were helpless against the crimson barrier, he knew that it would be impossible for him to escape the chaos.</p><p>Out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p><p>The only good news was that these people had no grievances with him, and no one was paying attention to this insignificant little nobody right now.</p><p>"It's probably the Ancient Demon's plot. I hope they can defeat the Ancient Demon."</p><p>Qin Sang felt powerless and muttered to himself.</p><p>No matter how dire the situation, he had never given up, struggling to fight for a path to survival. Now, he was truly helpless, only blaming himself for being too weak.</p><p>At least someone was holding the line.</p><p>If he fell into the clutches of the demons, and so many influential figures perished for him, it would be a glorious death.</p><p>After falling in, Qin Sang saw Qingzhu was also there, and he had initially felt a glimmer of hope, but then discovered Qingzhu's unusual state—not at all like their usual self.</p><p>This extinguished the hope that had just been rekindled in Qin Sang's heart. What new mishap had befallen Senior Qingzhu?</p><p>His gaze swept across the area, secretly observing the situation.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu possessed by the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul, Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>While on the mountain, the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul had been in the mountain hollow, surrounded by demonic energy. Qin Sang had only dared to observe from a distance and hadn't seen the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul's true form, but he had vaguely guessed something.</p><p>Su Nu's premonition was correct; the Three Great Merchant Alliances had ill intentions towards her.</p><p>But she was powerless to resist, ultimately ending up in this state.</p><p>Qin Sang then noticed the blood coffin and the sword energy.</p><p>This sword energy was extremely powerful, unlike anything he had ever seen.  Nan Gui Xianzi's words also confirmed that it was left by an ancient cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with surprise.  The sword energy contained a familiar aura.  Different cultivators might develop different styles within the same school of swordsmanship, but the underlying principles remained the same. Qin Sang stared intently at the sword energy, sensing its unique essence.</p><p>The cultivator who left this energy likely also practiced the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*!</p><p>The *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* clearly has deep ties to the Seven Kills Hall!  The Outer Hall's Heavenly Tower and the Inner Hall's Yitian Peak are testament to this.</p><p>...</p><p>The demonic energy surged into Qingzhu's body.  Qingzhu's face contorted, his eyes replaced by blood-red pupils.  Another energy pulsed within him, a silent roar. Qingzhu's spirit resisted fiercely but couldn't stop the invasion.</p><p>The onlookers exchanged glances, a chill running down their spines.  Though Qingzhu's cultivation was slightly weaker than theirs, the difference was minimal.  Yet he was utterly helpless. They realized they would likely fare no better.</p><p>Qingzhu's power soared, instantly breaking through his bottleneck to reach late-stage Yuan Ying, and continued to climb, startling everyone.  The Ancient Demon's true form was far more terrifying than its fragmented soul.</p><p>Without needing further explanation, the Great Shaman understood the situation and immediately forged an alliance with the human race.  Releasing the Ancient Demon would endanger both races.</p><p>At that moment, a strange energy wave erupted behind the Jiao Long King, pressed close to the crimson crystal wall.  Crimson flames appeared.  At the heart of the flames was a phoenix feather, one end clutched in the Jiao Long King's hand – the Heavenly Phoenix Feather given to him by Jiu Feng Wang!</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Feather manifested, its tip pointing towards the crimson crystal wall.  Blazing flames, seemingly real and illusory, erupted.  The next instant, the crimson crystal wall warped, as if about to be pierced!</p><p>A smirk played on the Jiao Long King's lips.  He was naturally furious and terrified upon witnessing the arrival of so many powerful foes.  While he didn't know the cause of the upheaval, or what was sealed within the blood coffin, he understood this: whatever the outcome, he would face a grim fate, potentially facing immediate attack.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Feather, a gift from Jiu Feng Wang, proved effective. Although inferior to a true feather, it still contained a fragment of the Heavenly Phoenix's power.  He had secretly summoned it, and it worked!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Jiu Ming Xuan Gui, who had been secretly communicating with the Jiao Long King, instantly blocked the Jiao Long King's path, manifesting a sturdy turtle shell to protect them. The Jiao Long King swung his arm, lightly slicing downwards with the Heavenly Phoenix Feather.</p>
