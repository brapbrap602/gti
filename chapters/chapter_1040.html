<h1>Chapter 1332: Contact</h1><p>Chapter 1332: Contact</p><p>Radiant light shone everywhere.</p><p>The interior of the pavilion was completely empty.</p><p>At this moment, numerous orbs floated within the space, each containing a magical artifact.</p><p>There were the common flying swords, as well as various other kinds of artifacts.</p><p>Among them, some artifacts were clearly damaged; these were ancient, ruined treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance, examining the artifacts within the orbs.</p><p>With his skills as a refiner, he could roughly identify some of the artifacts, but not the damaged ancient treasures. Some might have incredible uses, like the Red Yuan Silk, but their power was greatly diminished, likely self-destructing after only a few uses.</p><p>He reached out and easily drew an orb towards him.</p><p>After examining it for a while, Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Unable to use his spiritual sense, he found it difficult to accurately judge the artifacts' grades.</p><p>“Hey? Bring that iron chain over here, let me see…”</p><p>Bai suddenly spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced in the direction indicated, surprised to find that Bai wasn't pointing at a damaged ancient treasure, but at a complete artifact.</p><p>The complete artifacts in the Treasure Pavilion were crafted by predecessors who had completed the trials; they weren't from Bai's time. Why would he be interested in such a thing?</p><p>Qin Sang was curious and drew the orb containing the iron chain closer.</p><p>The chain was as thick as a baby's arm, link by link, each identical to the last. It was unremarkable, completely black, lacking any luster or inscriptions.</p><p>However, since it existed in the Treasure Pavilion, it must have its reasons; one shouldn't judge it by its appearance.</p><p>“Do you recognize this object?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Bai said in a questioning tone, “It looks somewhat familiar. I seem to have seen a similar-looking artifact before, but I can't recall what it is... It's probably just a coincidence.”</p><p>Then, Bai chuckled, “Which artifact do you like? Should I go out and try to get it for you?”</p><p>“Forget it, there's no way the Treasure Pavilion would have such an obvious loophole,”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “You could enter with me probably because of the Corpse Talisman; you're considered my corpse refinement. If you take an artifact, it will still be attributed to me. If we lose the Soul Cleansing Liquid because of this, that would be a huge loss. There's nothing more to see here; let's go back…”</p><p>No matter how good the artifact, it wasn't worth the risk compared to the Ebony Sword and the Eighteen Devil Banners.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and left the stone peak, finding a secluded spot to meditate and patiently wait for Ming Wei.</p><p>…</p><p>In the distance from the stone peak.</p><p>Inside a hidden cave.</p><p>Su Nu and the others stood at the cave entrance, gazing at the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>“We've seen several escaping lights enter the stone peak. Before that, there must have been others even faster. Most of these people are the true disciples of various sects, aware of the Soul Cleansing Liquid's existence. With so many people vying for the Soul Cleansing Liquid, it's bound to be incredibly fierce.”</p><p>The alluring woman's expression was grave. She turned to the elder with the long beard, “Senior Brother, how much longer do we have to wait? If we don't prepare early, I'm afraid we won't be able to compete with them. Especially those fellows from the Righteous and Demonic paths; they act domineeringly and might even team up to eliminate us first.”</p><p>“No need to rush, there's still some time before the Soul Cleansing Liquid appears. Let's wait another incense stick's worth of time. If Junior Brother Zuo doesn't arrive, we won't wait for him anymore.”</p><p>Said the long-bearded elder.</p><p>Everyone remained silent, quietly watching the stone peak.</p><p>Soon, an incense stick's worth of time passed.</p><p>Junior Brother Zuo still hadn't arrived.</p><p>“Let's go!”</p><p>The elder said in a low voice, taking the lead in flying out of the cave, the others following closely behind.</p><p>They went in the opposite direction, not towards the Treasure Pavilion, but flew for a long time in the opposite direction, eventually disappearing from sight of even the stone peak. They found a deep valley and stopped.</p><p>“Before Master left, he ordered us, after entering the final trial, to combine our efforts to activate this token…”</p><p>The long-bearded elder no longer concealed it, taking out a token from his pouch; it was identical to the token held by the leader of the East Pole Alliance outside.</p><p>“Junior Brother Zuo's strength is on par with mine, so he also has one. However, we know nothing about the token's function or Master's plan; we'll only know after trying…”</p><p>The others exchanged glances, staring at the token, unable to discern anything, they could only follow orders.</p><p>“Set up the formation and cast the spell!”</p><p>The long-bearded elder ordered, and everyone divided their tasks and began to work.</p><p>…</p><p>Another secret realm within the trial grounds.</p><p>This place was exceptionally hot, filled with billowing smoke and dust, blocking out the sky, yet exceptionally bright and glaring; it was a world of magma.</p><p>The magma surged wildly, creating crimson waves. From time to time, fire spirits leaped out, swimming in the magma; their size and strength far surpassed the fire spirits Su Nu had encountered.</p><p>Even more terrifying, space fissures crisscrossed above the magma, some even slowly moving—definitely a very dangerous place.</p><p>In such a dangerous place, there was a lone island that had not been swallowed by the magma.</p><p>On a solitary island, a kind-faced old man in gray robes sat cross-legged, seemingly lost in meditation.</p><p>His presence was almost imperceptible.  Fire spirits swam in the nearby lava, oblivious to his existence.  Anyone familiar with the scene would recognize him; he had stood behind the East Pole Alliance Master in the outer square before the inner sanctuary opened, and had chosen the Nascent Soul cultivator's trial.</p><p>The old man remained motionless, seemingly ignoring the surrounding dangers, showing no urgency to escape the trial.</p><p>After an unknown time, he suddenly opened his eyes, a glint flashing in his pupils. He produced another token—identical to the one he already possessed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Su Nu and the others were nearing the completion of their work. A massive, complex array, covering almost the entire valley, was taking shape.</p><p>The long-bearded elder took a deep breath and said gravely, "Begin!"</p><p>He tossed the token into the air above the array.  The others stood behind him, gazing upward.</p><p>Su Nu, watching his back, revealed a flash of anxiety in her eyes, but she dared not act with strong men standing beside her.</p><p>"Set!"</p><p>The long-bearded elder shouted, throwing the token and pointing a finger.</p><p>The token hung suspended in mid-air, at the array's center. The array activated, countless runes flashing and glowing.</p><p>A rumbling sound echoed.</p><p>The location's seclusion prevented discovery.</p><p>The array's energy surged into the token, causing it to vibrate intensely and glow, its light brightening to illuminate the valley.</p><p>The group anxiously watched the token's transformation.</p><p>Simultaneously, on the lava island, the token in the old man's hand faintly glowed, like a flickering candle.</p><p>His face lit up, and he quickly chanted an incantation.</p><p>Beneath the inner sanctuary's celestial prohibitions, the East Pole Alliance Master's token trembled, startling him awake.</p><p>Examining it for a moment, a slight smile touched his lips. "Hiding the main altar, which only a Nascent Soul cultivator can unlock, within a Foundation Establishment trial.  Did they think that would ensure foolproof security?"</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Wishing you a happy New Year, peace, joy, and an ever-improving life!</p>
