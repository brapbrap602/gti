<h1>Chapter 658: A Strange Golden Core Condensation</h1><p>“Finally, it’s here.”</p><p>Qin Sang slowly let out a breath.</p><p>The time was two days longer than Du Xian had estimated, likely due to some delay.</p><p>Du Han was piloting a golden leaf-shaped flying artifact, and he had brought along the disciple who had gone to fetch him, which slowed them down somewhat, but they were still not slow.</p><p>“Reporting to Master, Senior Brother sent word back. They are all at the Five Insects Gate now.  Everything is normal in the Xiong Mountain region, and that Golden Core cultivator hasn't returned yet.”</p><p>Du Han sat cross-legged on the golden leaf artifact. His disciple stood respectfully behind him, holding a message talisman, and said softly.</p><p>This message talisman was naturally sent by Qin Sang, controlled by Du Xian.</p><p>Du Han nodded slightly, looking far towards the Five Insects Gate, frowning and saying dissatisfiedly: “How careless! Why are they still at the Five Insects Gate? Are they afraid that Golden Core cultivator won’t find them?”</p><p>The disciple looked up, pondered for a moment, and softly excused Du Xian, saying: “Master, rest assured, Senior Brother must have considered everything carefully. He probably anticipated your arrival and came to the Five Insects Gate to greet you.  That Golden Core cultivator only formed their core less than a year ago, and according to the Five Insects Gate’s leader, that person’s innate insect Gu seems to have a problem, so they went out to search for insects to refine new insect Gu.  The possibility of their return in the short term is low.  After Senior Brother Jiu Shan and the others recovered from their injuries, relying on the Five Insects Gate’s protective mountain formation, even if that person suddenly appears, they can hold out for a while.”</p><p>Du Han coldly snorted: “I think you’ve been too comfortable cultivating within the sect, losing your vigilance.  Daring to underestimate cultivators stronger than yourselves—a whole major realm stronger, the outcome will never be good! Once this matter is settled, you will all go out on separate training missions, lest you become frogs at the bottom of a well.”</p><p>The disciple dared not argue and lowered his head in agreement.</p><p>As they spoke, the golden leaf drew an arc in the air and sped towards the Five Insects Gate.</p><p>The Five Insects Gate was in sight; from afar, one could see the lotus-shaped protective mountain formation, and the shadowy peaks within the formation.</p><p>Du Han stood up and looked towards the Five Insects Gate.</p><p>After looking for a while, a strange expression appeared in Du Han’s eyes, and he said in a deep voice: “When you entered the Five Insects Gate, did you attack the protective mountain formation?”</p><p>The disciple, hearing Du Han’s unusual tone, hurriedly looked towards the Five Insects Gate. However, he saw that the Five Insects Gate formation was perfectly normal and could see nothing unusual.  With a bewildered expression, he said: “No, we followed Master’s orders precisely, employing local forces to search for the ancient corpses. We committed no offenses along the way. Senior Brother showed his identity as a member of the Li Witch Palace; the Five Insects Gate didn’t suspect anything and let us in directly.  We didn't anticipate that the Five Insects Gate leader possessed a talismatic treasure, which led to the injury of two senior brothers…Master, has something happened to Senior Brother and the others?”</p><p>Du Han shook his head and mused: “I am interested in the Dao of spirit formations and once had in-depth discussions with a human cultivator who was an expert in it. I find the Five Insects Gate’s protective mountain formation somewhat strange, with many incongruities…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, Du Han suddenly felt a palpitation in his heart.</p><p>In an instant, Du Han’s hair stood on end, and he felt as if a great calamity was about to befall him. His complexion changed drastically.</p><p>“Who dares to be so presumptuous!”</p><p>As Du Han roared angrily, on the mountain in front of them, an extremely dazzling light suddenly erupted—a swift, terrifyingly powerful sword beam.</p><p>Qin Sang did not ambush at the Five Insects Gate but chose this location because he was worried that Du Han would discover the irregularities of the Five Insects Gate’s protective mountain formation or Du Xian and the others, thus becoming wary.</p><p>At that time, to achieve a quick victory and capture Du Xian and the others alive, he had to forcefully break through the Five Insects Gate’s protective mountain formation.</p><p>Although he later repaired the formation, he had little confidence in his own attainments in spirit formations. If he got too close, he might alert Du Han.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to set an ambush outside the mountain gate.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Du Han seemed quite proficient in spirit formations, noticing something amiss from such a distance.  Qin Sang secretly rejoiced while not daring to wait for him to approach further, and was forced to make his move.</p><p>Fortunately, the distance was not too far.</p><p>Feeling the terrifying aura of the sword beam, the disciple’s legs went weak, and he trembled, truly understanding the meaning of his Master’s previous words.</p><p>“Golden Core!”</p><p>A gleam flashed in Du Han’s eyes, and he instantly realized that something must have happened to his disciples.</p><p>Those he had brought to the Western Frontier were the most talented among his disciples, and Du Xian, in particular, was considered his own son and held in high regard.</p><p>Thinking that they might already have been killed by this person, Du Han flew into a rage, wishing to tear Qin Sang to pieces.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as this thought crossed Du Han's mind, he heard a faint rumble of thunder ahead.  He suddenly remembered a divine ability countless sword cultivators dreamt of, and a feeling of foreboding washed over him.</p><p>"Sword Qi Thunder Sound!"</p><p>Du Han was shocked. He never imagined that the Witch God Continent would have a sword cultivator genius so proficient in swordsmanship that they could comprehend Sword Qi Thunder Sound right after breaking through to the Core Formation stage.</p><p>Without time to think, Du Han slapped his dantian, and a burst of light erupted. A pale bone claw flew out from his energy sea.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, a sword shadow ripped through the void and appeared before Du Han.</p><p>Du Han's pupils constricted.  Now he understood why sword cultivators coveted Sword Qi Thunder Sound – its speed was incredible!</p><p>Startled into a cold sweat, Du Han remained calm under pressure. The bone claw, seemingly alive and incredibly agile, opened and intercepted the sword shadow at the very last moment.</p><p>A pale, strange light flashed on the claw as it swiftly lunged for the sword shadow.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Seeing Du Han summon the bone claw, Qin Sang, the sword cultivator, let out a surprised sound.</p><p>He clearly sensed that the claw was Du Han's soul treasure!</p><p>Du Han, a Witch cultivator from a prominent sect, hadn't refined a soul insect, instead opting for a soul treasure like human cultivators.</p><p>This was peculiar and unexpected to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't found this information from Du Xian and the others; Du Han had hidden it well, even from his own disciples.</p><p>Together with the treasure gifted by the Li Witch Palace, Du Han possessed two soul treasures!</p><p>Qin Sang's trap was designed to counter Du Han's soul insect, but the situation was different.</p><p>Moreover, Du Han had other strange aspects.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, Qin Sang sensed a faint demonic aura emanating from him. Initially thinking Du Han kept spirit beasts, he was on high alert, but found no beast pouch or similar item.</p><p>And then there was Du Han's strength.</p><p>His aura was indeed powerful, but not to the extent expected of someone nearing a breakthrough to the mid-Core Formation stage; he was weaker than anticipated.</p><p>Given the hasty encounter, Du Han's panic seemed genuine, suggesting he wasn't concealing his strength.</p><p>Perhaps Du Han had some hidden ailment or other reason.</p><p>Nevertheless, this was advantageous for Qin Sang.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through his mind, but Qin Sang remained focused on the battle.</p>
