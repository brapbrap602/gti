<h1>Chapter 1935: Qingyang Temple</h1><p>A large boulder slammed into the ground, bounced, then tumbled down the mountainside, across the mountain path, and finally landed in a ravine.</p><p>Grass and leaves scattered, a rumbling echo reverberating through the mountains.</p><p>The young man, using all his will, scrambled with hands and feet, narrowly dodging the crushing weight of the boulder, escaping death by his own trap.</p><p>"Huff... Huff!"</p><p>Gasping for breath, the young man turned his head upwards.</p><p>A poisoned spear was embedded in a tree trunk, the body of a white marten impaled upon it.  Its head, tail, and limbs hung limply. Demonic blood flowed down the spear, crimson mixing with the bluish-black poison.</p><p>The marten remained motionless, seemingly lifeless.</p><p>But the young man dared not lower his guard. Enduring the searing pain, he propped himself up and reloaded his light crossbow.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The crossbow bolt struck the marten squarely.</p><p>The marten offered no resistance.  Struck by the bolt, its body twitched violently, still impaled on the poisoned spear, as blood sprayed outwards.</p><p>Confirming the marten's death, the young man's body seemed to deflate. He collapsed onto the ground.</p><p>There was no pride in having hunted a demonic beast with a mortal body. He simply lay his head on the grass, staring blankly at the azure sky, murmuring, "Master, I have finally avenged you!"</p><p>Tears streamed from the corners of his eyes.</p><p>Memories of the past surfaced, the warmth of those days now a stark contrast to his present sorrow.</p><p>His mother had been frail and sickly since his childhood, passing away not long after. His father, a hunter, also met an unfortunate end in the mountains when he was eight.</p><p>At the tender age of eight, he had to fend for himself. His relatives and friends, though kind-hearted, were impoverished and unable to take him in, offering only what little help they could.</p><p>Aware of being a burden, he avoided troubling others as much as possible, striving to survive on his own.</p><p>Then came his Master, teaching them to read and write, imparting wisdom and knowledge.</p><p>His Master encouraged him to study, waiving his tuition fees. His Master's wife, seeing him as an orphan, showed him extra care, granting him a long-lost sense of familial warmth.</p><p>But the good times didn't last.</p><p>One day, his Master went to town to buy paper and ink for his students.  Night fell, and he did not return. The entire village searched, only to find a corpse.</p><p>His Master’s death was gruesome. His chest was ripped open, his internal organs missing, his body drained of blood, a withered husk.</p><p>The young man clearly remembered the feeling of devastation that struck him when the body was confirmed to be his Master’s.</p><p>His Master was the first victim of the demonic marten.  Afterward, others met the same tragic fate. The village organized several hunting parties, but to no avail.  Instead, the marten took advantage of the chaos, claiming several more lives.</p><p>No one dared mention hunting the demon again.  The young man could find no help, but the flames of revenge in his heart never extinguished.</p><p>He knew that the demon possessed powerful abilities. A single mistake could ruin his plan and cost him his life. But he had to do it, to avenge his Master. Otherwise, he would be unworthy of being called a man!</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>A sharp pain interrupted his thoughts.</p><p>He tried to lift his left arm, but the pain intensified, allowing him to raise it only halfway. He removed the iron plate from his body, revealing a ghastly wound.</p><p>His internal organs were undoubtedly injured. It felt as if a giant hand had squeezed his insides.</p><p>The young man stuffed a cloth into his mouth, biting down hard as he treated his wound.  Gasping for air, he struggled to his feet and moved towards the tree, tugging at the poisoned spear.</p><p>The spear was deeply embedded.  He no longer had much strength left and couldn't pull it free.</p><p>He retrieved the marten's body from the spear, picked up another poisoned spear to use as a crutch, and stumbled back towards the village.</p><p>The village was entirely surrounded by earthen ramparts.  After the marten’s appearance, guard towers and patrols were added.</p><p>By the time he reached the village, he was utterly exhausted.  Raising the marten’s body high, he cried out, “I killed the demon!”</p><p>Then he collapsed.</p><p>…</p><p>Xiao Wu and Zhuque, having watched a month-long drama unfold, still felt unsatisfied even as the curtain fell.</p><p>Qin Sang, oblivious to the outside world, focused on restoring the Thunder Altar, his skill growing with each passing day.  He had already recovered ninety percent of its functionality.</p><p>Within another month, he successfully restored the Thunder Altar completely.</p><p>After a brief moment of meditation, Qin Sang activated the altar. As expected, he sensed a faint connection with the other two Thunder Altars.</p><p>He immersed his entire consciousness, grasping this connection, triggering another transformation within the altar.</p><p>Simultaneously, the locations and relationships of the three Thunder Altars were etched into his mind.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>Above the altar, thunder and lightning raged.</p><p>Qin Sang was bathed in the tempest, yet remained unharmed. Each flash of lightning had a unique fluctuation, representing a new transformation.</p><p>Through these numerous transformations, and with the help of the other two altars, Qin Sang’s deductions became increasingly clear, ultimately pointing towards a specific location.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped with joy. Although he still couldn't sense the main altar directly, confirming its location significantly simplified the search, unless the main altar had been utterly destroyed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The lightning retreated into the altar, and it fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a formation to conceal the altar, preparing to immediately search for the main altar.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge from the crevice, Xiao Wu and Zhuque both looked over.</p><p>“Finished?” Zhuque asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I've determined the location of the main altar… Hmm? Taiyi has brought someone, waiting in the distance.  There might be a new development."</p><p>He sent a signal, summoning Taiyi.</p><p>Shortly after, a white cloud drifted towards them, carrying Taiyi and an elderly Daoist.</p><p>“Master, this is Daoist Jingchun, the Abbot of Xinh Huo Temple.”</p><p>Taiyi, imitating Luo Hou, addressed Qin Sang as Master in public.  He then introduced the elderly Daoist beside him, "This is my Master, whose Daoist name is Qingfeng."</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Qingfeng.”</p><p>In recent days, Daoist Jingchun had engaged in discussions with Taiyi and developed immense respect for him. Facing Qin Sang, whom even Taiyi addressed as Master, he was extremely deferential.</p><p>Through Taiyi's account, Qin Sang learned that Xinh Huo Temple was the largest sect in the vicinity, possessing a lineage of Thunder Dao inheritance.</p><p>Taiyi had thoroughly investigated this lineage, discovering that while the inheritance was related to the Heavenly Court's Thunder Division, it was rather unremarkable.  Worried that he might have misjudged, he brought Jingchun to Qin Sang for his assessment.</p><p>Daoist Jingchun, having received some undisclosed benefit from Taiyi, answered Qin Sang’s questions without reservation. Unfortunately, the Xinh Huo Temple's inheritance indeed lacked anything noteworthy.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to take his leave when Zhuque stopped him, acting coquettishly.</p><p>“There’s a good show that hasn’t finished yet! It won't hurt to wait a few more days!”</p><p>Having learned the details of the situation, before Qin Sang could speak, Daoist Jingchun angrily exclaimed.</p><p>"A demonic beast wreaking havoc, such a thing has happened! Our temple has an agreement with the Divine Dao, not to establish local Earth God shrines in this area, leaving it under our protection.  This incident is a negligence on our part.  I apologize for this embarrassing display.”</p><p>Daoist Jingchun’s righteous indignation rang hollow.  If his words were true, the demon would have been slain long before the young man risked his life.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal, glanced at Xiao Wu, and said, “Since you're interested, waiting a few more days won't hurt.”</p><p>They sat down on the ground.</p><p>Daoist Jingchun was uneasy, but relaxed when he saw that Qin Sang didn’t seem to blame Xinh Huo Temple.</p><p>With time to spare, Qin Sang asked Daoist Jingchun if there were any ancient legends in the area.</p><p>Daoist Jingchun racked his brains, recounting various tales, mostly absurd, but some with intriguing elements.  Unfortunately, none could be verified.</p><p>Six days later.</p><p>A rainbow light appeared in the distance, heading directly towards them.</p><p>"The main players have arrived."</p><p>Zhuque chuckled mischievously, glancing at Daoist Jingchun, clearly anticipating another good show.</p><p>They stood up, concealed themselves, and vanished from the mountaintop.</p><p>The rainbow light was a streak of escaping light, enveloping a flying shuttle carrying a man and a woman.</p><p>Both appeared young, their demeanor and attire as luxurious as royal offspring.</p><p>The man was comforting the woman: "Don't worry, Junior Sister.  The aura is growing stronger.  The Jade Dragon Marten must be nearby.  That little rascal managed to escape from my estate, it's quite clever.  It wouldn't dare provoke powerful enemies, at most it would prey on a few mortals. It’ll be fine."</p><p>“Don’t you dare say that!”</p><p>The woman’s face was filled with resentment. "It’s all your fault! You kept saying your people would take good care of it, convincing me to leave it at your estate.  Now it's gone! If anything happens to my Jade Dragon Marten, I'll go to Master and hold you accountable!"</p><p>“Alright, alright, hold me accountable. If the Jade Dragon Marten is dead, I’ll compensate you with a new one and have those maidservants killed to appease you.  How about that?”</p><p>The man offered a conciliatory smile.</p><p>“I don’t want a new one! I want my Jade Dragon Marten!”</p><p>The woman pouted, then suddenly her face lit up with delight. “I found it!”</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The rainbow light descended, landing upon a village below.</p><p>The two appeared above the village, their gaze fixed on a small Earth God shrine in the north.</p><p>Seeing the scene within the shrine, the woman’s face turned deathly pale, while the man's face darkened.</p><p>Since the young man brought back the marten’s corpse, he became a hero in the village. No one dared consume the demonic corpse, so it was offered to the Earth God.</p><p>“Who! Who dared kill Junior Sister’s Jade Dragon Marten!”</p><p>The man roared in fury.</p><p>Seeing the wounds on the marten’s body, the woman burst into tears, while the man was stunned.</p><p>“These wounds…”</p><p>The man sensed no traces of spiritual power or magical artifacts. The Earth God shrine also lacked an Earth God.  He couldn’t believe it.  “Could the Jade Dragon Marten have been killed by a mortal?”</p><p>No matter how weak, the Jade Dragon Marten was still a demon beast that had attained sentience. How could a mortal withstand its demonic arts?</p><p>The man’s roar startled the entire village.  Confused villagers, men, women, and children, poured out of their homes, following the sound to the Earth God shrine, where they saw the man and woman.</p><p>“They’re Immortals!”</p><p>Someone noticed that the man and woman were floating in mid-air, their feet not touching the ground, and cried out in astonishment, causing a commotion.</p><p>“Truly Immortals!”</p><p>“The Immortals have appeared! They’ve come to slay the demon!”</p><p>…</p><p>The villagers chattered excitedly, completely unaware that the demon was actually the Immortals' pet, truly believing that the Immortals had come to vanquish evil. Their eyes were filled with fervent adoration.</p><p>“Who killed Junior Sister’s Jade Dragon Marten? Step forward!”</p><p>The man's gaze was sharp, his killing intent palpable.</p><p>The woman, without turning her head, picked up the marten’s corpse and sobbed.</p><p>The villagers finally realized something was amiss.  They exchanged uneasy glances, falling silent, avoiding the man’s piercing gaze.</p><p>“I killed it!”</p><p>A strong, resonant voice rose from the crowd.  An old man, the village chief, stepped forward.</p><p>“Village Chief…”</p><p>Someone whispered, but the old village chief waved his hand, silencing them.</p><p>The old village chief walked out, his back straight as an arrow, even in the face of the Immortals.  “This demon slaughtered over a dozen people in our village alone, ripping open their bellies, draining their blood, leaving their bodies mutilated beyond recognition.  I killed it to avenge my fellow villagers! If you two Immortals want to avenge this beast, then kill me. Don't take it out on others. These old bones have lived long enough.”</p><p>These words weren't entirely directed at the two Immortals, but also at the villagers behind him.</p><p>The villagers understood the old village chief’s intention.  He was old, while the young man who slew the demon was still young, a hero. The old village chief was willing to die in his place.</p><p>The old village chief’s family could only weep softly.</p><p>Several strong men surrounded the young man, holding him back as he struggled.</p><p>“Heh…”</p><p>The man sneered.  “You mere mortals, daring to deceive this Immortal, your crimes are even greater! Get out here!”</p><p>With a thunderous roar, he nearly shattered the villagers' souls.</p><p>The young man felt his body tighten, seized by an immense force, involuntarily pulled forward and thrown hard onto the ground.</p><p>The men who tried to stop him were instantly sent flying, coughing up blood, unable to move.</p><p>The old village chief's attempt to take the blame couldn't fool the Immortal's discerning eye. A faint resentment clung to the young man, confirming him as the true culprit.</p><p>However, the man didn’t believe that the young man alone could kill the Jade Dragon Marten.  He grinned cruelly.  “Is there anyone else? Come out! Or did the entire village participate?”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>The old village chief’s expression changed drastically. Did the man intend to massacre the entire village?</p><p>“Is it only permissible for demons to eat people, and not for us to fight back? What kind of logic is that?!” the young man cried out in anguish.</p><p>“Hmph! What are you? A bunch of ignorant fools daring to speak of logic with this Immortal!”</p><p>The man had been keeping an eye on his Junior Sister. His actions were also meant to appease her.  “No one else is stepping forward? Good!”</p><p>Seeing no reaction from his Junior Sister, the man raised his hand, palm facing forward, his five fingers like swords, shooting five streaks of sword energy directly at the villagers.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A furious shout echoed from above.</p><p>Seeing that he was truly about to massacre the villagers, Daoist Jingchun couldn’t bear to watch any longer and revealed himself.  The five streaks of sword energy were dispelled by his shout.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others also landed on the ground.</p><p>“Senior Jingchun!”</p><p>The man was shocked to see Daoist Jingchun.</p><p>The woman also trembled, dropping the marten’s corpse, her beautiful face pale with fear.</p><p>Their sect possessed some strength, but in the face of the Abbot of Xinh Huo Temple, even their master would bow respectfully.</p><p>“Scoundrels! Your spirit beast descends the mountain to harm people, and you indiscriminately attempt to slaughter an entire village! Yin Xiao has taught two fine disciples indeed!”</p><p>Daoist Jingchun’s voice was sharp and filled with reprimand, striking the two like a thunderbolt. They knelt on the ground, trembling with fear.</p><p>“Senior, how should we deal with these two villains?” Daoist Jingchun’s words further terrified them.</p><p>“Since your temple has established laws, handle it accordingly.”  Qin Sang turned to Xiao Wu and Zhuque. “Have you seen enough?”</p><p>“Boring! Too weak. A Void Refinement old monster would be more entertaining,” Zhuque tossed her head, her tail swishing, her arrogant tone surprising even Daoist Jingchun.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  If they truly attracted a Void Refinement old monster, even his avatar wouldn't fare well.</p><p>“This matter is settled. We’ll take our leave.”</p><p>They bowed their farewells to Daoist Jingchun.</p><p>The villagers, having experienced a rollercoaster of emotions in such a short time, finally woke up from their daze. They realized that these Immortals were the good guys, their saviors.  They knelt down, expressing their gratitude.</p><p>“Mingyue, the Immortals saved us. Hurry and thank them for their kindness!”</p><p>The old village chief, seeing Mingyue still in a daze, quickly pulled him down, kneeling beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had already turned to leave, suddenly stopped, turning back to look at the young man. “Your name is Mingyue?”</p>
