Chapter 464: Confining the Stones


Many luminous orbs were intertwined with the restrictions, indistinguishable from one another.
Forcibly removing these Star Yuan Stones would trigger a chain reaction, potentially causing unpredictable changes to the restrictions.
Time was short, and even Granny Jing struggled to stabilize the restrictions. She warned Qin Sang not to cause any complications; if the Sky Point Peak space collapsed, none of them would escape.
No wonder Deputy Island Master Xiao hadn't mentioned this before.  Simply using the Spirit-Locking Bracelet made it difficult to retrieve the Star Yuan Stones entangled with the restrictions; only the Star Spirit Net could accomplish this.
"Enter from here."
Granny Jing didn't choose the seemingly safest path, ascending the waterfall and leaving the meadow.
Instead, she pointed to a stone path leading into the forest. Seeing Qin Sang hesitate, she calmly said, "Don't worry, Friend Han. I'll guide you through the restrictions. The Star Yuan Stones you collect along the way will be enough to surpass others."
The forest was dimly lit, deathly silent, and somewhat creepy.
Yet, it wasn't truly quiet. Multicolored lights flickered, resembling countless mischievous spirits, but they were actually fluctuations from fragments of the restrictions.
The colorful lights in the treetops were merely a portion of the restriction fragments within the forest.  These restrictions were ubiquitous, making the forest virtually impassable.
Ultimately, Qin Sang chose to trust Granny Jing.
Before entering the forest, Qin Sang looked upwards as far as he could.
Sky Point Peak's height was beyond imagination; its majestic silhouette soared into the clouds.
Qin Sang vaguely saw a peak resembling a soaring eagle—the Flying Peak, one of the few landmarks on Sky Point Peak, as Deputy Island Master Xiao had described.
Seeing the Flying Peak indicated he was positioned high up on the mid-slope of Sky Point Peak.
To be honest, his luck wasn't the best.
The luminous orbs on Sky Point Peak were distributed regularly; the closer to the summit, the more numerous and dangerous the orbs became.
The restrictions and terrain were more treacherous and complex there, but there were also many orbs untouched by restrictions, easier to collect.
Unlike here, this vast meadow didn't contain a single orb.
An hour—neither short nor long.
Judging by the surrounding terrain, without Granny Jing and the Star Spirit Net, Qin Sang had a chance to receive a reward, but to contend for first place, he had to risk his life and enter the forest.
Only by collecting Star Yuan Stones from between the restrictions did he have a chance.
Of course, there was another way, provided he encountered others.
He stepped into the forest.
Qin Sang's eyes suddenly brightened.  Half his face was bathed in red light, the other half in green.
The source of the light was the colorful glow between two ancient trees ahead.  The red and green lights pressed together, yet didn't blend, forming a clearly defined thin line between them.
They seemed to regard each other as enemies, refusing to yield, yet were bound in this space, only able to press against one another. Sometimes the green light dominated; other times, the red light swallowed a portion of the green.
Qin Sang approached the two-colored glow.  He heard Granny Jing say, "Collect the Star Yuan Stones above."
Looking up, Qin Sang noticed five luminous orbs floating between the treetops of those two ancient trees.
His luck wasn't bad; three were floating at the edge of the red and green lights.
The other two were nestled in the gap between the two colors, swaying with the lights.
"Leave the two in the middle," Granny Jing added.
Qin Sang understood.  The two orbs in the middle were deeply entangled with the restrictions.  Removing them would likely cause a violent conflict between the red and green lights.
He gently raised his hand. The silken threads in his palm shot towards the treetops, rapidly unfolding into a fine net once they left his hand.
Qin Sang had already refined the Star Spirit Net to his will. He quickly completed the hand seals, and the Star Spirit Net approached the three orbs, expanding into a large net, perfectly enveloping them.
‘Whoosh!’
The Star Spirit Net shone brightly, relentlessly engulfing the three orbs.
Under Qin Sang's precise control, the Star Spirit Net didn't touch the two-colored lights.
The orbs were not solid; they were merely clusters of Star Yuan energy condensed into clear starlight. Without special artifacts like the Star Spirit Net or the Spirit-Locking Bracelet, one could only pass through them.
It was impossible to condense them into Star Yuan Stones.
The moment the starlight was enveloped by the Star Spirit Net, it encountered its nemesis.  The light fluctuated, attempting to resist or escape, but couldn't break free from the Star Spirit Net's restraint.
The Spirit-Locking Bracelet could only capture one orb at a time, and its power was far inferior to the Star Spirit Net. It struggled to suppress even a single strand of starlight, requiring the user's full assistance.


If the light orbs couldn't be suppressed, they had to be abandoned immediately. Otherwise, if the orbs resisted and triggered the restriction, the fragile Soul-locking Bracelet wouldn't be able to withstand the impact.

Even using the Star Spirit Net, Qin Sang had to be extremely cautious when the orbs resisted.

Fortunately, his control was good, and he managed to bind all three orbs without incident.

Under the continuous suppression of the Star Spirit Net, the orbs' resistance weakened, their size shrank, and the starlight compressed inwards.

Gradually, the orbs transformed into small, irregularly shaped crystal beads.

‘Whoosh!’

The Star Spirit Net, enveloping the three similarly sized crystal beads, flew back into Qin Sang's palm.

These were Star Yuan Stones.

Called stones, they were actually beads.

Qin Sang felt a chill in his palm. The Star Yuan Stones were light, like catkins, almost weightless, yet incredibly hard.  He couldn't crush them even with a tight grip.

His spiritual sense swept over the Star Yuan Stones, sensing only an indescribable ethereal feeling.  This was a unique object unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen.

Could these be used to set up an array?

Intrigued, but knowing this wasn't the time to examine them, Qin Sang quickly put them into a special pouch provided by the Stargazing Island, tightened his grip on the Star Spirit Net, and turned to Granny Jing.

From summoning the Star Spirit Net to capturing the Star Yuan Stones, only a few breaths had passed—incredibly fast, far surpassing the pathetic Soul-locking Bracelet in efficiency.

Thinking of the two magical items waiting for him outside, Qin Sang felt immensely relieved.

Granny Jing, already aware of the Star Spirit Net's capabilities, showed no change in expression.  She stared intently at the gap of two-colored霞光, gently raised a jade finger, and said, "Enter through here!"

Time was too short for Qin Sang to discern the nature of the broken restriction fragment; he could only obey Granny Jing's command.

The forest's ancient trees weren't densely packed, and the paths were crisscrossing.  Yet, Granny Jing chose the most dangerous route.

*If she wanted to harm me, she wouldn't go to all this trouble!*

This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he didn't hesitate to follow Granny Jing's order.  His figure flickered, transforming into a streak of light that rushed into the gap of two-colored霞光.

At that moment, two exceptionally terrifying pressures suddenly appeared on either side of Qin Sang. If that pressure were to land on him, his robes wouldn't last a moment; he would be instantly crushed into a pulp.

Fortunately, the moment he felt the pressure, he had already passed through the gap of two-colored霞光 and appeared on the other side.
