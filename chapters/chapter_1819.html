<h1>Chapter 1810: The Corpse Field</h1><p>This spirit tree seemed to be the foundation of the entire palace.  Once the tree was removed, the palace instantly began to collapse.</p><p>Only then did the three realize that the entire palace was an illusion!</p><p>Qin Sang shouted a warning almost the moment the palace started to crumble, but it was too late to prevent the disaster.</p><p>The collapse was fastest in the main hall.  Ripples, like those spreading across water, emanated from the palace doors, rapidly expanding.</p><p>Thunder flashed on Qin Sang's back, but before he could summon his Azure-Luán Phoenix Wings, the ripples reached him, engulfing him with a strange force.</p><p>A similar scene unfolded in another main hall.  Just in the nick of time, Master Bohyun, his face pale with shock, sharply jerked his wrist.  A golden ring on his wrist emitted a resounding clang.</p><p>Qingtan Yuanjun, also wearing a jade ring on her wrist, heard a clear chime.</p><p>The two ornaments shone with golden and jade light, seemingly connected, their glows echoing each other. A slender thread materialized between them, linking the two.</p><p>Qingtan Yuanjun, now realizing something was wrong, felt her jade ring vibrate violently.</p><p>The thread tightened suddenly, dragging Master Bohyun with immense force, pulling him free from the ripples. He was shaken, his eyes filled with terror as he watched Qin Sang swallowed by the waves on the other side.</p><p>Their situation wasn't much better than Qin Sang's.  The entire palace was collapsing; the ripples were everywhere, spreading from all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang's last sight was of the two figures retreating rapidly, surrounded and cornered by the ripples.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A deafening roar filled his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang felt like a helpless bird caught in a hurricane.  In a desperate attempt, he hastily activated his treasures and divine abilities for protection, furiously flapping his phoenix wings as lightning flashed repeatedly. He managed to barely stabilize himself but was still swept towards the ground.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A snapping sound came from beneath his feet.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself on solid ground, realizing he had fallen.</p><p>“That sound is wrong…”</p><p>The situation was unclear, so Qin Sang didn't recklessly extend his spiritual sense.  However, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly immediately transmitted its thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang's face instantly changed.</p><p>Beneath his feet was a skeleton. The sound had come from a rib he had crushed; the bone was decayed, shattering into several pieces under his weight.</p><p>Worse, there was more than one skeleton.</p><p>In his and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's vision, the ground was covered with countless, ghastly white bones.</p><p>The bones were packed together, layer upon layer, an immeasurable depth.  Even in the dim light, their whiteness was glaring, chilling him to the bone.</p><p>It was impossible to imagine the horrific massacre that must have taken place here.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed that the bones weren't only human; there were various animal bones as well. But in the area he could see, human bones made up more than half.</p><p>“A battlefield between humans and demons?”</p><p>Recalling rumors about the Jushan Cult, a guess formed in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Another possibility was that this, like the palace, was another undiscernible illusion.</p><p>Among the piles of bones, plants grew.</p><p>These plants were thriving, extraordinarily vigorous, as if the bone-covered soil was incredibly fertile, providing ample nutrients.  Each plant was as thick as a large tree.  Having landed, Qin Sang could see the roots and leaves, a strangely familiar sight.</p><p>Could it be…?</p><p>A possibility struck him, causing his heart to tighten. He flew into the air.  After passing through the foliage, he saw a horrifying sight.</p><p>Bones covered the earth.</p><p>Spirit flowers grew among the bones, their vibrant blooms astonishingly beautiful. A strange, intensely rich fragrance filled the air.</p><p>This scene immediately reminded Qin Sang of the flower field he had seen within the swirling mist.</p><p>The flower field in the mist was certainly connected to this place.  They had mistaken the bones for soil.</p><p>Moreover, the spirit flowers here were more sparsely distributed, only one per patch of bones, unlike the dense field in the mist.  But they were far larger than those in the mist.</p><p>It seemed that a section of the bone flower field had been projected into the mist, inevitably distorted from its true form.</p><p>The following changes confirmed Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>One by one, the spirit flowers swayed, spraying filaments and pollen from their stamens.  Flower cocoons drifted above the field of bone flowers.</p><p>The cocoons were light and larger than a person.</p><p>Then, bizarre scenes replayed before Qin Sang. The cocoons split open, and the flower spirits inside sat up, knees drawn to their chests.</p><p>Regardless of gender, the flower spirits were all delicately beautiful, clad only in what seemed like pollen-woven gauze. Their figures were graceful, their demeanor natural, like celestial maidens.</p><p>However, the flower spirits weren't looking to the heavens, nor were they dancing. Instead, they all stared at Qin Sang, the sole outsider in the field of bone flowers!</p><p>No matter the distance or direction, all the flower spirits watched Qin Sang, their heads turning stiffly, some bodies contorting grotesquely.</p><p>Their eyes were vacant, expressionless, devoid of joy, sorrow, or anger.</p><p>Qin Sang's scalp tingled. He sensed a deep resentment in the flower spirits' empty eye sockets.</p><p>Indeed, flower spirits grown from consumed bones and corpse energy could hardly be without resentment.</p><p>Flower spirits born in such a place must be evil spirits!</p><p>Gradually, the resentment in the flower spirits' eyes intensified, converging on Qin Sang alone, bringing a bone-chilling coldness.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>Even from behind the mist, Qin Sang had been wary of the flower spirits. Now, trapped in the field, his apprehension grew.</p><p>He scanned his surroundings, but found no sign of Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren.</p><p>At the far end of the bone flower field, mountain silhouettes loomed in the distance. This appeared to be a valley nestled within mountains.</p><p>Beyond the mountains, there seemed to be a vast expanse. Considering the mist, this bone flower field might not be unique.</p><p>If Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren had persevered a little longer, they might have ended up elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang had also considered whether Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren had set a trap for him. But their panicked reactions seemed genuine, and he had no quarrel with them; he had even saved a disciple of Qing Dan Yuanjun. What motive would they have to harm him?</p><p>Their concealment of the treasure ring's function seemed normal to Qin Sang; he himself kept many secrets and couldn't afford to be unguarded with strangers.</p><p>The truth remained unclear, preventing a definitive judgment. The priority was to escape this dangerous situation.</p><p>The intense floral scent concealed a potent poison. Surrounded by it, there was nowhere to hide.</p><p>The fragrance relentlessly assaulted him.  If he couldn't escape quickly, if he remained trapped long enough to reach his poison bead's limit, Qin Sang's situation would become extremely perilous.</p><p>"How many of these bones are from cultivators who fell in accidentally?"</p><p>As his thoughts raced, Qin Sang noticed a strange change in the flower spirits' expressions.</p><p>Immediately, pollen swirled above the field, a riot of colors flowing toward him.</p><p>Soon, the pollen coalesced into a humanoid shape, forming a pollen giant nearly ten zhang tall. The pollen suddenly contracted, transforming into a graceful woman.</p><p>The woman was sacred and pure, with skin like jade, like a flower fairy. Her gentle gaze rested on Qin Sang, devoid of the resentment of the other flower spirits; in her expressive eyes, there seemed to be tender affection.</p><p>After the flower fairy appeared, the flower spirits' eyes softened, their resentment subsiding.</p><p>"You've come,"</p><p>Joy flickered in the flower fairy's eyes. Her voice was like celestial music, intoxicating.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>"You've finally come to keep me company. Do you know how lonely I've been here?" The flower fairy's gaze shifted to a melancholic yet tender affection. Extending a jade hand, she murmured softly, "I long for your embrace…"</p><p>At this moment, the flower fairy resembled a celestial maiden awaiting her beloved's return, the affection in her beautiful eyes deeply stirring.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He couldn't allow an unknown person to approach him. He instinctively stepped back, about to speak.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon seeing Qin Sang retreat, the flower fairy's expression changed instantly, becoming horribly contorted. She let out a shrill scream, "You dare scorn me!"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react,</p><p>the flower fairy plunged into madness, her ten fingers raking across her flawless complexion, instantly leaving ten bloody gashes, tearing off a layer of skin.</p><p>Then, the flower fairy's form swelled, her exquisite appearance fading as she transformed into a hideous ghost with a swollen yellow face, a gaping maw, teeth several inches long, and a bluish tongue.</p><p>The ghost glared at Qin Sang, its rage earth-shattering.</p><p>With the ghost's shriek, the previously quiet flower spirits once again erupted with overwhelming resentment, tears of blood streaming from their eyes.</p><p>In an instant, the flower field became a demonic realm.</p><p>"It's a malevolent spirit!"</p><p>Qin Sang showed no fear, coldly snorting as the thunder wings on her back beat, transforming into a burst of lightning that tore through the air.  She unleashed her lightning escape technique without reservation; her speed was astonishing. A thunderbolt flashed across the void.</p><p>Unfortunately, even Qin Sang's incredible speed couldn't shake off the evil ghost. Pollen filled the air, and the ghost instantly reappeared before her.  She felt a ferocious aura wash over her, the ghostly figure lunging.</p><p>Seeing she couldn't gain an advantage through escape, Qin Sang abruptly halted her flight, shifting several meters sideways. A sword light shot from her sleeve.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Huiying sword trembled, splitting into a beam of sword light. The light, like thunder, slashed fiercely at the ghost.</p><p>The ghost showed no intention of retreating, extending a ghostly hand to grasp the sword light directly.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The sword light pierced the ghostly hand, leaving a shocking wound, but the injury instantly healed.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave; the ghost was stronger than she anticipated. To make matters worse, the flower spirits of the entire field were disturbed. Borne aloft by the pollen, they floated towards Qin Sang with ethereal grace.</p><p>Tears of blood flowed down their faces, a tragic beauty laced with deep resentment. This resentment, combined with the flower poison, surged towards her.</p><p>Qin Sang acutely sensed the change in the flower poison, her expression growing even more serious.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A fierce wind struck her face.  Qin Sang's eyebrows rose slightly; she didn't dodge or evade, launching a punch like a dragon, imbued with the power of the Destroyer Seal.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>A ghostly hand appeared before Qin Sang, only to be met by her powerful punch. The spikes on her glove pierced the ghostly hand; eerie blood light flowed along the spikes, seeping into the ghost's body.</p><p>Whether or not the ghost truly felt pain, it let out a sharp scream, its ferocity intensified.</p><p>At that moment, a sword cry echoed from above.</p><p>The sky darkened, the constellations arrayed. The Seven Mansion Divination Sword Array reappeared, enveloping not only the ghost but also a large section of the flower field and the flower spirits.</p><p>Buddhist seals appeared repeatedly. Qin Sang, instead of retreating, pressed forward, charging towards the ghost.  Simultaneously, the sword stars flashed one after another, unleashing sharp sword energy. However, the sword energy wasn't aimed at the ghost, but at the flower spirits.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh…'</p><p>The sword energy pierced the air, like tragic meteors across the night sky.</p><p>The flower spirits sensed the danger, their bleeding eyes fixated on the sword energy, emitting screams. Their resentment, fused with the flower poison, solidified, forming a barrier between them and the sword energy.  Unfortunately, the sword array scattered them, breaking their formation, and they were continually cut down.</p><p>Although entangled with the ghost, Qin Sang mostly focused her attention on the flower spirits. She saw that every time a flower spirit was killed, a spirit flower withered.  But immediately, new buds sprouted in the withered places, giving birth to new spirit flowers.</p><p>This place was similar to that forest; the flower spirits were inexhaustible, yet Qin Sang felt no trace of wood spirit energy.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang's gaze settled on the ghost. This place was too strange; who knew what lay beyond the field of bone flowers. The flower spirits lacked intelligence; the ghost was the only one she could communicate with.  It was best to capture the ghost alive and learn the origin and way out of this place.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang's attack became even more ferocious. Simultaneously, the remaining flower spirits were excluded from the sword array, with sword stars hanging above her and the ghost.</p><p>At this moment, all seven mansions of the sword array appeared, locking onto the ghost.  Against another opponent, Qin Sang might have hesitated, fearing they'd see through her, but the ghost was frenzied, only wanting to devour Qin Sang's flesh, completely ignoring the sword array.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang, ghostlike, dodged the ghost's attack, passing under its arm, circling behind it, and striking its back fiercely. This blow combined the Auspicious, Altar-Turning, and Destroyer seals; its power was extraordinary.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The ghost was heavily struck, lunging forward, nearly falling. Instantly, sword energy rained down, instantly engulfing the ghost.</p><p>The ghost howled, sustaining numerous wounds, bursting through the rain of swords, but Qin Sang was already waiting ahead.</p><p>Under layers of defense, the ghost couldn't truly injure Qin Sang's body, but there was one exception.  As they fought, the surrounding flower poison grew increasingly dense, each of the ghost's movements carrying poison, putting immense pressure on Qin Sang.</p><p>"I can't fight for long!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank, a fierce glint in her eyes. Her figure shifted, appearing before the ghost, her attack almost frenzied.</p><p>In the heavens, the sword stars blazed with brilliant light. Instantly, the stars shifted, the seven mansions moving in unison.</p><p>The starlight converged, sword intent flowing like a river. This starlight's power was far greater than before. Mid-flight, the starlight twisted, transforming into a white tiger that descended from the sky.</p><p>The White Tiger's ferocity was unparalleled, a celestial demon descending from the heavens, gathering the power of the stars, shaking the mountains and rivers.</p><p>The White Tiger's savagery! The Western Seven Mansions are also known as the White Tiger Seven Mansions. This technique was the true killing move of the Seven Mansion Divination Sword Array. Only by fully comprehending the sword array could one grasp the White Tiger's savagery.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's first use of the White Tiger's savagery; she didn't know its full power.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The tiger roared through the heavens. Even before the savagery arrived, the ghost seemed startled by the roar, its body stiffening, its eyes filled with fear.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop her attack, smashing a heavy blow into the ghost's chest, sending it flying. Then she sensed something strange about the ghost.</p><p>Self-destruct?</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly; she hadn't expected the ghost to be so ferocious. Abandoning the idea of capturing it alive, she retracted her fist, concentrating on controlling the White Tiger's savagery.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The white tiger broke through the air, descending above the ghost, passing right through it.</p><p>The ghost, on the verge of self-destruction, its energy chaotic, suddenly stiffened. The next moment, its flesh and blood turned to ashes.</p>
