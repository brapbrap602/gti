<h1>Chapter 665: The East Pole Alliance</h1><p>Chapter 665: The East Pole Alliance</p><p>Several pretty maidservants attended the shop. Like the guards at the city gate, they were a mix of Wu and human races, seemingly without any friction.</p><p>Qin Sang could now easily distinguish between humans and the Wu people.  Although there were no obvious outward differences, their bloodlines were distinct, resulting in slightly different auras.  The shop even sold artifacts for discerning bloodlines.  This difference was easily noticeable when facing cultivators weaker than himself.  Qin Sang was grateful for his caution in not rashly interacting with other Jindan-stage cultivators in West Xinjiang.</p><p>As Qin Sang entered, a maid smiled and approached him.  Upon seeing the badge on his waist, she became even more respectful.  “Honored Immortal, please come in.  May I ask if you wish to purchase artifacts or pills, or perhaps sell something? Our high-quality treasures and precious pills are on the third floor. If you require them, please follow me.”</p><p>“You sell treasures?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He’d long heard of the vast influence of the Four Seas Trading Company, but its headquarters were in human territory. He never expected a branch in the Wu God Continent to possess treasures.  Curious about the prices, Qin Sang allowed the maid to lead him to the third floor.</p><p>On the third floor, a Foundation Establishment cultivator of evidently higher status took over, leading Qin Sang into a private room.</p><p>“May I ask your honorable name, senior?”</p><p>After introducing herself, the cultivator smiled charmingly and served Qin Sang tea.</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice was low. “My Daoist name is Qingfeng. I heard your esteemed company sells treasures.  What kind of treasures are they? What is their power? And what are their prices?” He had revealed his identity in West Xinjiang and could only use a pseudonym in Wu territory.</p><p>The cultivator laughed at Qin Sang’s rapid-fire questions. “Senior, I wouldn't hide it from you.  Our company only has three treasures left in Pingbo Port.  If you're interested, bartering is best. We'll have a Pingbo Port expert assess the value of your items, and we assure you won't lose out.  Of course, if you're willing to pay enough spirit stones, we'll sell them. I'll go fetch the treasures for you to examine…”</p><p>Even a large trading company casually pulling out three treasures! Qin Sang was amazed.</p><p>After a short wait, the cultivator returned, placing three jade boxes on the table for Qin Sang’s inspection.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't sense any other experts watching, but seeing the cultivator’s confidence, he knew the Four Seas Trading Company must have other methods to prevent him from stealing the treasures and fleeing.</p><p>Facing the three treasures, Qin Sang found himself tempted, quickly suppressing his distracting thoughts and opening each box one by one.</p><p>Inside the three jade boxes were a dark tortoise shell, a whip seemingly made from some kind of demonic beast's spine, and a flying sword.</p><p>To Qin Sang's disappointment, the quality of these three treasures was low. The flying sword was inferior to his Ebony Sword, yet its price ranged from tens to hundreds of thousands of spirit stones.  Even without considering his treasures like the Three Lights Liquid, Qin Sang couldn't afford them even if he sold everything.</p><p>Only the tortoise shell caught his attention. It was a defensive treasure, crafted from the shell of a tortoise demon, and its defensive capabilities were decent.</p><p>If he didn't have the Black Water Mirror, he might have considered it.  After all, he didn't lack offensive or escape methods, but he did lack a defensive treasure.  The Black Water Mirror was both offensive and defensive, but mediocre in both aspects.  However, due to its high quality, its defensive ability wasn't much worse than the tortoise shell, sufficient for Qin Sang's needs, so there was no need to buy another one.</p><p>He could certainly exchange his own treasures for it, but he wouldn't be foolish enough to do so.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang shook his head, closed the jade boxes, and pushed them back.</p><p>The cultivator, having experienced such situations many times, remained composed, her demeanor remaining warm towards Qin Sang.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang stated the purpose of his visit. “I need to refine some items and require earth-evil qi.  Does your esteemed company have any channels to help me locate earth-evil qi near Pingbo Port? Spirit stones are not a problem.”</p><p>“Earth-evil qi?”</p><p>The cultivator looked at Qin Sang in surprise.  As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, she knew that earth-evil qi was an extremely yin-natured substance that cultivators feared, yet someone was actively seeking it out.</p><p>What kind of item would require earth-evil qi?</p><p>This thought flickered in the cultivator’s mind before being suppressed. She didn’t dare pry into the secrets of a Jindan-stage cultivator; otherwise, the company wouldn't protect her.</p><p>The cultivator stood up.  “Please wait, senior. I’ll immediately order someone to investigate…”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped the cultivator with a wave of his hand, throwing her a pouch of spirit stones. “One more thing.  Find out which trading company plans to send people to Wu God Mountain to use the teleportation array to the Storm Demon Sea.”</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall incident had made Qin Sang acutely aware of the urgency of the situation.  Sufficient strength was essential for self-preservation within the Seven Killing Hall.  He didn't plan on exploring human territories, opting instead to go directly to the Storm Demon Sea to hunt demons and cultivate. The closest route was naturally the ancient teleportation array on Wu God Mountain.</p><p>We need to leave, and the sooner the better. Otherwise, if those Wu Clan Nascent Souls return, who knows what trouble it will cause.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Du Han that the Wu Clan Nascent Souls had disappeared en masse, and she felt a storm brewing.  The Canglang Sea is turbulent; perhaps the Stormy Demon Sea offers some refuge.</p><p>But the problem is, she's human.</p><p>While Wushen Mountain doesn't exclude human cultivators, it's deep within the Wu Shen Continent.  A long journey separates it from Pingbo Harbor, requiring passage through many powerful Wu Clan sects.</p><p>Venturing there alone, she'd likely be surrounded and killed before going far.</p><p>Top trading companies daring to do business on the Wu Shen Continent have close ties to Wu Clan forces.  Traveling with them is the safest option.</p><p>Qin Sang isn't alone; other human cultivators on the Wu Shen Continent do the same.</p><p>Jiggling her pouch, the female cultivator smiled sweetly, “Senior doesn’t need to ask others, I know.  The Qiongyu Trading Company of the Dongji Alliance has a senior manager in Pingbo Harbor, preparing to return to the Stormy Demon Sea in a month. The news just came out, and they’re recruiting. With senior’s cultivation, you’ll certainly be valued by Qiongyu. Even if you don’t want to join, as long as you don't violate their rules, Qiongyu is willing to build a good relationship…”</p><p>“The Dongji Alliance? The large trading alliance spanning the eastern sea area?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped. With the Dongji Alliance's backing, traveling with the Qiongyu Trading Company would guarantee her safety.</p><p>“That's right.  Members displaying the Dongji Alliance's flag can travel freely across the Wu Shen Continent. The Qiongyu Trading Company's outpost is at the northernmost part of the trading district.”</p><p>The female cultivator gave detailed directions.</p><p>“Thank you, fellow cultivator.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, then produced a list, “If your esteemed alliance sells these herbs and materials, please get them for me as well.”</p><p>The female cultivator took the list, examined it, and nodded.  “We do have some of those herbs in stock. I’ll be right back.”</p>
