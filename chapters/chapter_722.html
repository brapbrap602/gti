<h1>Chapter 714: Black Flame</h1><p>Qin Sang approached his first attempt at crafting a magical artifact with utmost care.</p><p>He retrieved the jade slip provided by Shopkeeper Wu, meticulously studying the notes on artifact refinement again and again, diligently comprehending its secrets.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner expanded to about ten feet in height, planted in a triangular pattern before Qin Sang. The banner fluttered, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire converging in the center, appearing remarkably calm.</p><p>After a moment’s deliberation, Qin Sang surveyed the various spirit materials, selecting the easiest to refine—a spirit material called Silver Stone, drawing it into his palm.</p><p>The Silver Stone was rough and pitted, resembling a rock embedded with countless silver beads.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed it into the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and infused it with his true essence.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire opened and closed, enveloping the Silver Stone.</p><p>The Silver Stone tumbled within the flames.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire’s power was far superior to ordinary earth fire; signs of melting quickly appeared on the Silver Stone’s surface. However, due to the high demands on the refiner during the process, the speed remained slow.</p><p>As smoke billowed, after prolonged refinement, the impurities were purged, leaving behind the purest essence.  A large chunk of Silver Stone was ultimately reduced to a silver liquid the size of a longan.</p><p>Qin Sang wiped the sweat from his brow, quickly taking out a jade bottle to store the silver liquid.</p><p>He pinched the bottle's neck, raising it before his eyes, gently shaking it.</p><p>The silver liquid only oscillated slightly on the surface, extremely viscous.</p><p>Remarkably, within this silver liquid, almost imperceptible black threads were visible, starkly contrasting against the silvery white.</p><p>Qin Sang fell into contemplation. These black threads were the residual power of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire after refining the spirit material, a phenomenon he’d encountered more than once when crafting magical instruments.</p><p>However, the purity of the silver liquid's color made these threads rather prominent.</p><p>Having found that these residual forces had little effect on magical instrument refinement, and even enhanced their power, Qin Sang didn't attempt to remove them, instead welcoming their presence.</p><p>However, magical artifacts differed from magical instruments.</p><p>Magical artifacts possessed greater power and demanded higher refinement standards.</p><p>There was a possibility that the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, which had no impact on magical instruments, could lead to the failure of magical artifact refinement.</p><p>Furthermore, when refining magical instruments, Qin Sang only needed to refine one or two core spirit materials with the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire; he could use earth fire for other auxiliary materials, making the process easier.</p><p>Every spirit material in a magical artifact was crucial; Qin Sang had to refine each one individually, resulting in a stronger Nine Netherworld Demon Fire essence within the final artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang restored his true essence while considering the pros and cons.</p><p>Based on his previous refining experience, the power of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire had already integrated with the spirit material during the refining process, making a sudden eruption during the final artifact refinement unlikely.</p><p>And if this method succeeded, the artifact's power would significantly increase, making it worth a try.</p><p>Following this, Qin Sang proceeded with the refinement methodically.</p><p>The true essence consumption was too fast when activating the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, making continuous refinement impossible; Qin Sang could only patiently work slowly.</p><p>Until the last material, the Wan Shi Camphor, was refined, Qin Sang let out a soft breath, meditating for a day and night to recover from his exhaustion.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the various spirit materials, his gaze sharpening slightly.  He suddenly reached out.</p><p>The Yin Ring shot into the Demon Fire with a ‘whoosh,’ while Qin Sang simultaneously tapped his fingers, sending several spirit materials flying in as well.  Although the Yin Ring was damaged, using it as a guide made refining the Yang Ring prototype much easier.</p><p>As time passed, all the spirit materials merged into one. Next to the Yin Ring, a similarly sized Yang Ring prototype emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang popped a handful of spirit pills into his mouth, adding a few more spirit materials. The Yang Ring’s outline became clearer, while the rate of true essence consumption was alarming.</p><p>Qin Sang lost track of time. He focused entirely on the artifact's refinement, paying attention to his true essence fluctuations to avoid depletion and failure.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang had thrown all the spirit materials into the flames. In the center of the Demon Fire, two bracelet-sized golden rings could be clearly seen standing side by side.</p><p>The Yang Ring, which had only been an outline, had solidified. The Yin and Yang rings resonated with each other, slightly shaking. They did not touch, yet a clear ringing sound emanated from them.</p><p>This was the crucial step!</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned serious, not daring to relax in the slightest.  This time, he held nothing back, directly unsealing the Corpse Pill, pouring all his remaining true essence into the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner.</p><p>The flames surged, the ringing sound echoing through the cave, like demonic vibrations.</p><p>Deep within the Demon Fire, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring vibrated to its limit, then instantly fell silent.</p><p>A flash of light!</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>A sudden, sharp whistling sound pierced the air. The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire fluctuated violently, and then two rings shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, extending a hand to grasp the rings.  True energy formed a large hand, seizing the  Hun Yuan Tong Xin Rings. The artifacts' struggle weakened, eventually ceasing as they fell into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up. He lowered his head to examine the two rings.</p><p>The Yin and Yang rings were identical in shape – perfectly round and white. The Yin ring, previously damaged and dull, was now completely repaired.</p><p>However, there was a difference.  Faint, ethereal black flames flickered across the surface of both rings, more prominently on the Yang ring.</p><p>Qin Sang surmised that the black flames were remnants of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire. Fortunately, they hadn't negatively impacted the refinement process.</p><p>“How will these black flames affect the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Rings?”</p><p>Qin Sang was both curious and expectant.</p><p>After confirming the rings' integrity, he immediately activated his spiritual sense.  The Hun Yuan Tong Xin Rings were effectively new artifacts, free of any previous owner's mark, ready for refinement.</p><p>A short while later, he withdrew the artifacts into his dantian.  Soon, he would completely master them, controlling them as extensions of himself.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang, mid-cultivation, suddenly opened his eyes.  Glancing at his dantian, a thought flickered through his mind. A white light shot out, transforming into a ring that Qin Sang caught.</p><p>This was the Yang ring of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Rings.</p><p>After successful refinement, the Yin ring remained in his dantian, acting as both an early warning system and remote control for the Yang ring.  The Yang ring itself would be used to subdue beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang probed the Yang ring with his spiritual sense, eyes closed. After a thorough examination, he infused it with true energy.</p><p>A buzzing sound echoed, the Yang ring glowing brightly.  White rings shot downwards, expanding in size to form a tower-like structure.</p><p>These rings seemed like some kind of magical restraints, possessing a peculiar binding power, though there was currently no target.</p><p>And, like the rings themselves, these projections also displayed faint traces of black flames, disrupting their pure white appearance.</p><p>A look of intense surprise crossed Qin Sang's face.</p><p>The Yang ring's binding power was far greater than he anticipated.</p><p>Originally, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Rings could only subdue early-stage beasts. Now, they might be capable of subduing mid-stage beasts!</p>
