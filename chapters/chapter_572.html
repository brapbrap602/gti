<h1>Chapter 565: The Abyss of Sin</h1><p>Chapter 565: The Abyss of Sin</p><p>A sudden, noticeable fluctuation occurred.  Although the area ahead was shrouded in darkness, everyone sensed something amiss.  Qin Sang and the others, entering the Purple Micro Palace for the first time, were unaware of the situation.  They initially attributed the anomaly to some shift within the celestial array, feeling worried but not overly panicked.</p><p>However, the Yuan Ying cultivators all changed countenance.</p><p>The Red-Haired Ancestor suddenly erupted in fury, his eyes blazing at True One Daoist.</p><p>“Old geezer, what trickery is this?!”</p><p>True One Daoist looked utterly bewildered, frowning.  “Red-Haired Devil, what’s gotten into you?”</p><p>The Red-Haired Ancestor roared, “If you’re itching to die, I’ll gladly accompany you after we get out of here. But daring to play games within the celestial array? I'll destroy the Northern Dipper Star Array right now! Without the array, let's see how many of you can escape!”</p><p>True One Daoist, inexplicably berated, felt a surge of anger. He couldn't understand what had gotten into the Red-Haired Ancestor.  Ignoring the anomaly was one thing, but this infighting was another.</p><p>As the cultivators from both sides engaged in mutual suspicion, the fluctuation from ahead, no longer content with merely blocking their path, suddenly surged towards them with astonishing speed.</p><p>They were still within the celestial array, surrounded by the terrifying void winds. Without the protection of the Lesser Northern Dipper Star Array, even Yuan Ying cultivators couldn't guarantee their safety.</p><p>Mutual distrust existed, but no outright rupture occurred.</p><p>They attempted to maneuver the Lesser Northern Dipper Star Array backward to evade the threat, but the fluctuation's speed only increased, incredibly fast, reaching them in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Finally, they could see vaguely defined figures emerging from the darkness, their faces indistinguishable!</p><p>“Who’s there?!”</p><p>True One Daoist, ignoring the Red-Haired Ancestor, stared ahead in furious surprise.</p><p>Encountering humanoid creatures within the celestial array was undoubtedly a bad omen.</p><p>The Red-Haired Ancestor looked at True One Daoist suspiciously, thinking, *Could it really be the Heavenly Walk League?*</p><p>Earlier, Chong Yi Daoist had secretly transmitted a message: the leader of the Limitless Gate and Huang Yun Daoist of the Heavenly Walk League were secretly colluding. He hadn't paid much attention to it.</p><p>The Lesser Cold Domain was a fragmented place, its various sects largely independent. It wasn't unusual for the leader of the Limitless Gate and someone from the Heavenly Walk League to be acquainted.</p><p>The Limitless Gate's mountain gate was located in the Lesser Cold Domain, with countless disciples; it wasn't easy to relocate.  The Red-Haired Ancestor believed that unless the leader of the Limitless Gate was foolish, he would know how to choose when faced with a significant event.</p><p>Could any friendship outweigh self-interest?</p><p>Although Chong Yi Daoist hinted at their clandestine actions, suggesting a guilty conscience, the Red-Haired Ancestor felt that they could simply wait until leaving the Purple Micro Palace and then investigate, taking precautions in the meantime.</p><p>If there truly was treachery, he didn't believe the leader of the Limitless Gate could keep up appearances indefinitely.</p><p>In the Red-Haired Ancestor's opinion, even if the leader of the Limitless Gate had been bought by the Heavenly Walk League, he wouldn't act within the celestial array. But unforeseen circumstances could occur, so the moment the anomaly appeared, the Red-Haired Ancestor immediately suspected the Heavenly Walk League.</p><p>Cultivators from the two domains had entered the Purple Micro Palace countless times, whether during the Red-Haired Ancestor’s two expeditions or those of previous generations.  No one had ever encountered such an anomaly within the celestial array.</p><p>The fact that this happened now made the Red-Haired Ancestor suspicious!</p><p>Just as the Red-Haired Ancestor was filled with doubt...</p><p>A cackling laughter echoed from the darkness. “Haha… Old geezer, Red-Haired Devil, never expected the Sin God Palace’s and the Purple Micro Palace’s celestial arrays to be connected, did you?”</p><p>“Ye Lao Mo!”</p><p>“The Abyss of Sin!”</p><p>The Red-Haired Ancestor and True One Daoist both paled.</p><p>Since ancient times, the Purple Micro Palace in the Ancient Immortal battlefield and the Sin God Palace in the heart of the Abyss of Sin had always appeared at the same time, without exception.</p><p>During this period, no matter how intense the conflict, the various domains would unanimously choose a truce.</p><p>All the domain cultivators knew that these two divine palaces must have a deep connection; otherwise, they wouldn't consistently appear simultaneously.</p><p>Despite the countless years and efforts expended by countless cultivators, no one had ever uncovered the true nature of the relationship between the Purple Micro Palace and the Sin God Palace.</p><p>When inter-domain relations were less strained, or under the leadership of a powerful late Yuan Ying cultivator, several cross-domain explorations had been attempted.</p><p>All to no avail.</p><p>Firstly, even late Yuan Ying cultivators lacked the ability to discern the deepest secrets of the two divine palaces.</p><p>Secondly, the prohibitions, treasures, and architectural styles within the Purple Micro Palace and the Sin God Palace were completely different, a world apart.</p><p>The Purple Micro Palace, with its towering celestial gate and swirling immortal clouds, resembled a celestial palace descending from the heavens.</p><p>The Sin God Palace, however, was an undeniable demonic palace.</p><p>Now, the abyss has discovered that the outer celestial arrays of two great shrines are interconnected, and a passage between them has opened, appearing before them!</p><p>Chifa and Zhenyi racked their brains, unable to figure out how Ye Laomo discovered the connection between the two celestial arrays, but they realized that things were dire.</p><p>Ye Laomo's purpose in appearing here is obvious!</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>Chifa suddenly realized something and cried out, repeatedly shouting to Zhenyi, "Beware of Huangtian!"</p><p>Before Zhenyi could react, a brilliant blood glow erupted simultaneously in the heart of the Xiao Han and Tianxing League cultivators' formations.</p><p>These two blood glows originated from the yellow-robed Daoist of the Tianxing League—the Yuan Ying cultivator known as Huangtian—and the Wuji Sect Master!</p><p>Their positions were extremely strategic.</p><p>Everyone stood around the star chart, divided into two camps.</p><p>Zhenyi and Chifa led the way.</p><p>Huangtian assisted in manipulating the Xiao Beichen Star Array, surrounded by Tianxing League cultivators who protected him.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master stood beside Leng Yuntian, also among the Xiao Han cultivators!</p><p>The moment the blood glow appeared...</p><p>It wasn't the Yuan Ying cultivators who recognized it first, but Qin Sang.</p><p>This blood glow was too familiar; he had used it countless times.</p><p>The Blood-Polluted Divine Light!</p><p>However, these two blood glows were on a vastly larger scale, incredibly intense, soaring to the heavens, and soul-stirring—far surpassing the power of the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Ebony Sword only refined a single fragment of the Infinite Blood Mulberry, thus its limited power.  These two individuals possessed at least half a tree's worth of Infinite Blood Mulberry.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally understood what Huangtian and the Wuji Sect Master were searching for in the Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>They were looking for the Infinite Blood Mulberry!</p><p>Years ago, during their battle against the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon, their target was precisely the Infinite Blood Mulberry fragment he had stolen.</p><p>Legend has it that Infinite Blood Mulberry once appeared in the Wuyaya Valley, shattered during a struggle among the demonic sect's Yuan Ying cultivators, scattering countless fragments throughout the valley's depths.  This legend is widespread.</p><p>However, there had been no concrete evidence over the years that anyone had ever actually found any.</p><p>Had Qin Sang not obtained a fragment himself, he too would have considered it a fabrication.</p><p>The depths of Wuyaya Valley are filled with countless dangers; even Yuan Ying cultivators dare not easily venture there. Even with thorough preparations and a lucky find, the risk far outweighs the reward.</p><p>These two individuals must possess some protective measures to dare enter the valley in search of the Infinite Blood Mulberry, and they actually managed to collect so much.</p>
