<h1>Chapter 698: Fusion</h1><p>â€œFellow Daoist is right. The Thousand Demon Sea is in such a state now, it will be difficult for it to return to its former tranquility. Although dangerous, it holds many treasures not found elsewhere. It's a pity," a scholar in blue robes echoed, expressing his regret.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and looked around. "I have stated my conditions. Which fellow Daoist has something I desire and is willing to trade?"</p><p>He looked at each person in turn, but no one responded, leaving him deeply disappointed.</p><p>At this moment, an elder who appeared to belong to a merchant guild, after whispering to someone beside him, spoke, "The items you seek, Fellow Daoist, are all rare treasures. Even with all my efforts, I can only guarantee finding one of them, the Soul-Guiding Herb. If you are willing, Fellow Daoist, I don't want these demon cores and magical treasures. I wish to discuss a different trade."</p><p>The Soul-Guiding Herb was an unexpected delight.</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang asked, "What trade do you propose, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>The elder pondered, "Fellow Daoist can produce so many demon cores at once, indicating extraordinary strength. I would like to invite you to join us. Once you are one of our own, things will be much easier. I can request the Inner Sea to send one or two Soul-Guiding Herbs. Even the other spiritual items might not be entirely impossible to obtain."</p><p>After speaking, the elder transmitted his voice to Qin Sang, revealing himself to be from a renowned merchant guild.</p><p>Qin Sang was amused. He hadn't expected to encounter another recruitment attempt upon arriving at Hutian Island.</p><p>Judging by this person's tone, the power behind him was even greater than the Qiongyu Merchant Guild. Unfortunately, Qin Sang had no interest in being under someone else's control, let alone selling himself for the Soul-Guiding Herb.</p><p>"If the Soul-Guiding Herb is in the Inner Sea, how long will it take for me to obtain it?"</p><p>A trace of embarrassment appeared on the elder's face. "The sea routes are not safe at the moment. It is estimated that we will have to wait until the conflict between the two races ends... But Fellow Daoist needn't worry, we can draw up a written agreement.  Furthermore, by joining our guild, you won't have to shoulder many responsibilities, but you will enjoy many benefits that others can only dream of..."</p><p>No matter how the elder tried to persuade him, Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>Since the elder couldn't sway Qin Sang, the others didn't bother trying.</p><p>For a time, silence fell upon the hall.</p><p>Seeing no hope, Qin Sang sighed softly and said helplessly, "Fellow Daoists, if any of you possess spirit pills suitable for Core Formation cultivators, you can also exchange them."</p><p>This time, more people were willing to trade.</p><p>Qin Sang not only exchanged for several types of healing spirit pills with excellent efficacy, but also luckily obtained a bottle of pills that could aid cultivation, making the trip worthwhile.</p><p>After the transaction was completed, it was the next person's turn. Just as Qin Sang put away his items, his right ear twitched slightly. He raised his head discreetly and looked towards another corner of the hall.</p><p>A short, stout cultivator was looking at him. Their eyes met, and the man nodded slightly before calmly turning his attention to the treasures presented by the next person.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, lowered his head in thought for a moment, and was finally drawn back to the ongoing trade meeting.</p><p>Although everyone had waited for a long time, the actual trading was swift. Shortly after midday, the last transaction was concluded. The elder stood up, made a few polite remarks, and announced the end of the trade meeting.  The crowd then dispersed and left the island under the guidance of the marketplace.</p><p>Before Qin Sang departed, the elder gifted him a compass and invited him to the next trade meeting.</p><p>After leaving the island, Qin Sang flew some distance on his sword, cautiously glanced behind him, and landed on a deserted island. He took out his map, located a place marked Black Hawk Island in the same sea region.</p><p>Looking at the small island marked on the map, a thoughtful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>At the trade meeting, Qin Sang had already given up hope. Unexpectedly, the stout cultivator had transmitted a message to him, indicating that he had a way to cross the Thousand Demon Sea, but didn't want the treasures Qin Sang had offered.  He told Qin Sang to come to Black Hawk Island for a detailed discussion after leaving the marketplace.</p><p>After some deliberation, Qin Sang decided to take a look.</p><p>However, there was one more thing to do before that, something he was rather eager about.</p><p>After setting up a barrier formation around him, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, removed the bone flute hanging around his neck, and took out the other bone flute as well.</p><p>He held his breath, looking at the two bone flutes. They were indeed identical, indistinguishable even when held up close.</p><p>He placed one bone flute in each palm. Although they were now reunited, nothing unusual happened.  A puzzled look flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.  Finally, he actively brought the two flutes together.</p><p>*Click!*</p><p>The moment they touched, a crisp sound rang out, and the two bone flutes joined together automatically.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He was almost ready to activate the formation and prepared to flee if the commotion attracted the attention of nearby cultivators.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after joining together, the bone flute trembled slightly, its surface shimmered with light, and then there were no further unusual occurrences.</p><p>The biggest change was that the power of the constellations within the bone flute became more concentrated and pronounced.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and examined it closely. The two small sections formed a long bone flute, seamlessly integrated, without any visible trace of a break.</p><p>Confirming that the bone flute had stabilized, Qin Sang tentatively probed it with his divine sense.  Just like before, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response.</p><p>"It seems the bone flute must have other fragments scattered elsewhere.  It won't reveal any power until all the fragments are gathered..." Qin Sang muttered to himself, feeling quite regretful.</p><p>It was already fortunate to find one bone flute fragment in a foreign land. The other fragments were scattered who knew where. If they were also in different cultivation worlds like these two, the hope of finding them was incredibly slim.</p><p>In the end, after many more unsuccessful attempts, he reluctantly tossed the bone flute into a corner of his Thousand Treasures Ring.</p><p>"It's about time..." Qin Sang looked up at the sky and flew towards Black Hawk Island on his sword.</p><p>As evening approached, Qin Sang saw the silhouette of a small island in the distance. The highest peak on the island resembled the outstretched wings of a black hawk, hence its name.</p><p>As soon as Black Hawk Island came into view, Qin Sang descended from his sword and hovered in the air.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin has arrived. Why not come onto the island?"</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang appeared, a streak of rainbow light flew from the island, revealing the figure of the stout cultivator, who called out loudly.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he stared at the dark Black Hawk Island. He said coldly, "It seems there are other fellow Daoists on the island, which you did not mention beforehand."</p><p>The stout cultivator was taken aback. He chuckled awkwardly, "I didn't say I only invited Fellow Daoist Qin! Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, this fellow Daoist is an acquaintance whom I just met at the trade meeting. There are a few other fellow Daoists yet to arrive..."</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, another figure flew from the island.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze and saw that it was indeed the scholar in blue robes he had met at the trade meeting. Qin Sang had a strong impression of him. The treasures this person had presented were extraordinary, suggesting considerable strength.</p>
