Chapter 488: Slaying the Black Dragon, Taking the Soul


Wuyagu Valley.
Qin Sang entered the valley alone, revisiting this familiar place.
Wuyagu Valley is vast and boundless.  The areas where cultivators operate are actually a tiny fraction of the whole. Qin Sang trained here for over twenty years, and knows it like the back of his hand.
He has powerful artifacts, allowing him to venture into dangerous places others wouldn't dare, resulting in significant gains.
Most of these gains went into buying materials for refining artifacts and improving his skills, even going so far as to deplete his supply of cold iron to forcibly boost his refining abilities.
He successfully entered the second level of Wuyagu Valley.  Passing through the White Stone Wilderness, a barren landscape appeared before Qin Sang.
It was a sea of grey stones, densely packed, growing larger the further in he went. The largest stones in the deepest part were magnificent, some comparable to mountains.
On the outer edges of the stone sea, he saw many妖群 (demon groups). But once deep within the stone sea, not a single demon beast could be seen.  It seemed to be a forbidden zone, a boundary the beasts dared not cross.
In Wuyagu Valley, places like this weren't uncommon; most harbored the lairs of powerful demons. This black dragon’s territory wasn't particularly large, considering it was only at the peak of the Yaoling stage.
Qin Sang concealed himself and his aura, silently flying through the stone sea. Finally, he climbed a towering stone, looking down.
Two massive stones were almost fused together, with only a narrow gap between them. At the bottom of this gap was a hidden abyss, and the black dragon was hidden within.
The abyss lacked the overwhelming demonic aura or strange lights and mists one might expect; it looked unremarkable.
“It wouldn't be that lucky, to break through to the Yaodan stage already, would it?”
Qin Sang stared at the abyss, muttering to himself. He opened his corpse puppet bag, and instantly a dark shadow appeared silently beside him—the Flying Night Rakshasa.
Its speed was so fast, its appearance was practically invisible to the naked eye, incredibly strange.
Now, the Flying Night Rakshasa had completely merged with the Corpse Pill in its abdomen, its power reaching its peak.  The black dragon would serve as the perfect test.
“Go!”
Qin Sang gave the command in a low voice. The Flying Night Rakshasa lowered its head; its black eyes shone with a deep, intelligent glint, eerily unsettling. Then, it vanished.
Qin Sang himself didn't descend, but instead sat cross-legged, taking out the Ten Directions Yama Banner, quietly setting up a large formation, and also bringing out his artifacts.
Of course, the most important was the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.
The talisman appeared in Qin Sang’s palm, the dragon soul within sending a fawning thought. Qin Sang held the talisman, gazing down at the abyss, waiting to see what happened.
The abyss was pitch-black, ancient restrictions everywhere.
The Flying Night Rakshasa descended rapidly. Qin Sang's understanding of the restrictions here was inferior to the black dragon's, and the Rakshasa inevitably triggered some hidden ancient restrictions, quickly revealing its presence.
“Roar!”
A furious roar echoed from the depths of the abyss.
‘Splash!’
The river water here was icy cold. In the calm dark river, water suddenly splashed, followed by a huge black shadow surfacing. The shadow was long and slender, even the part above the water was dozens of feet long.
The black dragon's upper body rose, its triangular snake head held high, its crimson tongue flicking, its vertical pupils filled with killing intent, looking incredibly sinister in the dim abyss.
Unlike the dragon beasts Qin Sang had seen before, this black dragon had a bulge on its forehead, with a horn already poking through.
Its jet-black scales were incredibly dense, harder than metal, shining with a strange luster, appearing exceptionally smooth. As the black dragon emerged, the water flowed down quickly.
Its warning had no effect; the intruder remained undeterred, moving even faster.
The black dragon's eyes blazed with furious anger.
‘Crash!’
Giant waves erupted from the dark river; a long dragon tail shot out from the riverbed, creating a black whirlwind, emitting a pungent fishy smell.
The whirlwind was exceptionally cold; the dark river's surface froze into thick ice at a visible speed.
The splashing waves instantly turned into ice shards.  These ice shards were extraordinary, shining with a blue light and incredibly sharp.
Wind of demonic energy, ice of profound coldness—the whirlwind and ice shards intermingled, and with a violent swing of its tail, they hurtled towards the intruder with incredible speed.
Just as the Flying Night Rakshasa seemed about to be overwhelmed by the overwhelming attack, Qin Sang, seated on the stone, smiled faintly.
The Flying Night Rakshasa looked coldly at the approaching wind, its eyes flashing with a faint light, and suddenly unleashed a punch.
In front of the enormous wind, the Flying Night Rakshasa appeared so small.
Yet, this punch held earth-shattering power.


BOOM!

A terrifying punch tore a hole through the whirlwind.  Feitian Yecha flew through the gap, completely unharmed.

This astonishing sight caused Hei Jiao's eyes to bulge. The ferociousness in them was instantly replaced by sheer terror.  The fearsome fist magnified rapidly in Hei Jiao's eyes, and it could only manage to jerk its head aside.

BANG!

Hei Jiao took the punch head-on. Its massive body, flung like a rag doll, crashed violently against the Abyss's wall.

Hei Jiao let out a scream, cut short by Feitian Yecha.  Appearing behind Hei Jiao in an instant, Feitian Yecha's ghostly claws easily pierced its scales, tearing away a large chunk of flesh.

Hei Jiao roared in agony and fled.

However, Hei Jiao, a peak-level demon spirit, wasn't without resistance. The Abyss erupted into chaos, a flurry of human and demonic forms.

Qin Sang, calmly seated outside the Abyss, remained connected to Feitian Yecha, monitoring the battle. His goal wasn't to kill Hei Jiao, but to drive it out, while simultaneously blocking all other escape routes, forcing it to flee upwards. The Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman required a living dragon's essence.

The chaos in the Abyss intensified, the ground beneath Qin Sang shaking violently.

Suddenly, a surge of intense demonic energy erupted. Qin Sang's expression shifted, his eyes narrowed as he watched the Abyss.  Moments later, a battered and bruised Hei Jiao tumbled out. Feitian Yecha, furious and relentless, pursued closely behind.

Hei Jiao was a pathetic sight, far from its previous peak-level demon form.  It was horribly wounded, several deep gashes marring its body, blood pouring from its injuries.  One eye was gone, replaced by a long, gaping wound.  After this brutal battle, Hei Jiao had lost all will to fight, its only desire being escape.

Seeing Hei Jiao driven out, Qin Sang swept his arm, and the prepared Ten Directions Yama Banner unfurled with a whoosh.  The ghostly banners formed a tight array, completely sealing off the Abyss's exit.

WHOOSH…WHOOSH…

Countless ghostly flames surged forth, enveloping Hei Jiao from above, creating a pincer attack with Feitian Yecha.

Hei Jiao was trapped.
