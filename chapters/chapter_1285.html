<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1277: Schemes of All Sides</p><p>"The demon race has helped us drive back the Sin Abyss, but their forces will not step beyond the Skywalk Plateau. Once we enter the grasslands, we will have to rely on ourselves. However, we can negotiate with the demon kings individually. As long as we offer them conditions they cannot refuse, we should be able to recruit some..."</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi spoke while glancing at Qin Sang.</p><p>The demon race, bound by an ancient covenant, had sent troops to repel the invading enemy. However, the covenant did not obligate them to assist in invading others, which was a reasonable demand.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. He understood that Daoist Zhenyi wanted him to act as an intermediary.</p><p>But even when he had disguised himself as a demon, he had not managed to befriend many demon kings. Only the Serpent King could be considered somewhat of an acquaintance. After revealing his true identity, he was unsure how the Serpent King would react.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's reluctance, Daoist Zhenyi's expression flickered with disappointment. He guessed Qin Sang's predicament and did not press further.</p><p>"Hmph! The Heavenly Demon Peaks would be more than happy to see us humans fight amongst ourselves until rivers of blood flow and peace is forever lost. If not for the covenant, they would not only stand by and watch but likely fan the flames in secret, pushing us and the Sin Abyss into a life-and-death struggle. This time, they have a good plan. If we cannot completely extinguish the Sin Abyss's momentum, we will be trapped in an endless cycle of war."</p><p>Someone snorted coldly, clearly dissatisfied with the demon race's actions.</p><p>Everyone in the hall understood the demon race's intentions.</p><p>Someone chuckled, "If the power and status of humans and demons were reversed, we would also worry about the demons unifying and attacking us together. It's only natural. Regardless of the demons' intentions, they sent troops to aid us in our most difficult time. We cannot ask for more."</p><p>"However, the Heavenly Demon Peaks have always been united, unlike us humans who are constantly embroiled in internal strife. In recent years, they have indeed grown stronger, with demon kings frequently emerging. Fortunately, Fellow Daoist Qin is of human origin and not the Moonlight Demon King. Otherwise, we would truly have to worry that one day, the demons would possess enough strength to no longer remain dormant in the Heavenly Demon Peaks and stir up trouble again."</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator from the Skywalk Alliance sighed.</p><p>Even Dongyang Bo had to admit that, based on recent achievements, Qin Sang was the most promising among all the newly ascended Nascent Souls in the Two Realms Alliance, perhaps even unprecedented.</p><p>Of course, how much he would achieve in the future was still uncertain. It depended on whether Qin Sang would encounter insurmountable bottlenecks. Such tragedies had happened before.</p><p>...</p><p>Skywalk Plateau.</p><p>Before the second tier, the central camp of the Sin Abyss.</p><p>The Sin Abyss had built a city here, with banners fluttering and cultivator armies gathering.</p><p>In the center of the camp, within the most magnificent palace, a cultivator in a blue Daoist robe with a cold expression and black beard stood at the palace gate, gazing at the vast snowy plains in the distance.</p><p>Only one tier remained before reaching the Skywalk City at the peak of the Skywalk Plateau, but it was like an insurmountable chasm, firmly held by the Skywalk Alliance and the Cold Domain.</p><p>This person was the Crimson Flood True Lord, one of the three giants of the Sin Abyss, stationed at the central camp.</p><p>His strength was equally unfathomable, no less than that of the Heavenly Justice Elder. He had once been the leading figure of the Sin Abyss's righteous path until the sudden rise of the Demonic Lord Ye, who then took the title of the Sin Abyss's strongest.</p><p>Judging by appearance, the Crimson Flood True Lord appeared to be around fifty years old.</p><p>He stared at the Skywalk Plateau for a long time, recalling the various pieces of news he had received recently, and let out an almost imperceptible sigh before returning to the palace.</p><p>In the center of the palace, a dazzling light shone, revealing a miniature snowy mountain.</p><p>The mountain's contours were an exact replica of the Skywalk Plateau.</p><p>On the mountain, not only were all the camps and cities, including Skywalk City, perfectly replicated, but there were also densely packed, ant-sized figures gathered in clusters.</p><p>These figures were not lifeless; they could move freely at any time and could cast spells and incantations like real cultivators.</p><p>The figures were of different colors. For example, the red figures represented the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two Realms Alliance.</p><p>These were created by the Sin Abyss using restrictions and spirit talismans, serving a similar purpose to the sand tables used by mortal armies.</p><p>The Crimson Flood True Lord furrowed his brow, deep in thought. After a moment, he suddenly raised his hand and tapped on the snowy mountain repeatedly.</p><p>The figures on the mountain began to move rapidly, some retreating, some attacking. Amidst the chaos, colorful spells and restriction lights flashed, and then swathes of figures fell.</p><p>"I almost forgot!"</p><p>The Crimson Flood True Lord suddenly remembered something and pointed at two red figures.</p><p>These two represented Qin Sang and Qing Jun.</p><p>The Crimson Flood had already learned about the events in the Blood Lake. The enemy's swift discovery of the Black Tower Formation's core had indeed caught them off guard, but what surprised them the most was the sudden emergence of Qin Sang and Qing Jun.</p><p>Without these two, even in a direct confrontation, the outcome would not have been so disastrous, leaving the Sin Abyss in a passive position.</p><p>The strength of these two red figures had greatly increased.</p><p>Such powerful experts, if not restrained by peers, could only be countered by sending multiple Nascent Souls or relying on the Shadow Crystal Towers to contain them. Allowing them to wreak havoc on the battlefield would be unbearable for anyone.</p><p>The Sin Abyss was indeed beginning to struggle. Even with the Shadow Crystal Towers, they were being forced to retreat repeatedly.</p><p>After running through the simulation once, the Crimson Flood True Lord waved his hand, and the snowy mountain returned to its original state. The figures squirmed and rearranged themselves into new formations, and the Crimson Flood ordered them to continue fighting.</p><p>Again and again, the situation remained unfavorable for the Sin Abyss.</p><p>After pondering for a while, the Crimson Flood True Lord took out several sword talismans. Using his finger as a brush, he swiftly inscribed them and then flicked them lightly. The talismans transformed into streams of light and flew out of the palace.</p><p>The excessive contemplation had taken a toll on his mental energy. The Crimson Flood True Lord gently massaged his temples and was about to return to meditate when he suddenly sensed something and looked towards the palace entrance.</p><p>"These past days have been taxing for you, Fellow Daoist Crimson Flood..."</p><p>The voice grew closer.</p><p>Moments later, a figure appeared before the palaceâ€”it was the Demonic Lord Ye.</p><p>Seeing him arrive alone, the Crimson Flood True Lord couldn't help but frown and quickly asked, "How is the Heavenly Justice Elder's injury?"</p><p>The Demonic Lord Ye sighed and entered the palace.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Heavenly Justice used a secret technique to avoid a fatal disaster. However, the technique consumed a great deal of energy, and the enemy's methods were fierce, causing his injuries to worsen. His foundation was nearly shattered. We sent him back to the Star Pool of the Star Constellation Sect and poured our true essence into the pool to stabilize his condition. He is gradually recovering, but he will not be able to take action for the next few years."</p><p>Hearing this, the Crimson Flood True Lord sighed inwardly. This was the worst possible outcome they had anticipated.</p><p>At that moment, the Demonic Lord Ye suddenly coughed lightly.</p><p>The Crimson Flood True Lord glanced at him. "I heard you were forced to self-destruct a clone comparable to your main body?"</p><p>The Demonic Lord Ye smiled bitterly. "Fellow Daoist, there's no need to look at me like that. The clone was something I refined in the Blood Lake while crafting the Blood Banner. Inspired by a secret technique I had obtained earlier, I only recently perfected it. If I had possessed the clone earlier, I would not have held back, nor would there have been any need to hide it. But before it could achieve any merits, it was destroyed by that Moonlight Demon King, and it even affected my main body."</p><p>"The Moonlight Demon King?"</p><p>The Crimson Flood True Lord chuckled. "Fellow Daoist Ye, you haven't heard the news yet. That person is not a demon king but a human cultivator."</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>The next chapter will be delayed.</p>
