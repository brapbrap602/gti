<h1>Chapter 808: Qu Heng Island</h1><p>When Qin Sang pressed further for more information,</p><p>the Wang surname cultivator shook his head and said, “I’ve been traveling for decades and haven’t returned once.  Decades pass, and everything changes.  I only heard rumors of this extraordinary person's existence back then, and I know nothing more since. If you’re interested, I’ll give you the address of Linggui Island. However, if the island master’s temperament hasn't changed, it may be difficult to see him.”</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist Wang.”</p><p>Qin Sang noted down the address.</p><p>The Wang surname cultivator wanted to hunt妖 in the Demon Sea and asked Qin Sang for advice.</p><p>Qin Sang had spent several decades in the Demon Sea and had considerable experience. He immediately shared detailed precautions with him, and both were very pleased.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Qin Sang took his leave and returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p>He took out a nautical chart of the southwest sea region, located the Liefeng Islands, and confirmed the position of Linggui Island.</p><p>As the Wang surname cultivator had said, Linggui Island was very remote.  Without guidance, Qin Sang wouldn't have thought of it in a million years that Elder Qingzhu would choose such a place to establish a daoist base.</p><p>The imagery of peach blossoms had always been subtly connected to Elder Qingzhu.  Intuition told Qin Sang that he should go and see for himself.</p><p>However, Tianxing Island and the Liefeng Islands were far apart.  A round trip would take years, and he would also have to guard against various hidden dangers along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered in his cave dwelling for a long time before finally deciding to make the trip. Acting decisively, he immediately began preparations, purchasing necessary supplies, and setting off a few days later.</p><p>Before his departure, Qin Sang sent a message to Madam Liu's informant.</p><p>For over a year, there had been no news from Madam Liu.</p><p>Assassinating a close confidante of the Alliance Leader, who was also a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, meant waiting patiently for the right opportunity. However, finding Elder Qingzhu was clearly more important than killing Xiang Yi.</p><p>Prepared, Qin Sang left Tianxing Island alone. After traveling a distance, he summoned his two-headed beast and rode it across the water.</p><p>Because he still hadn't figured out the effects of the spirit fruit, Qin Sang didn’t dare to give it to the two-headed beast rashly. The two-headed beast was uneasy, but under Qin Sang's firm control, it could only obey.</p><p>One person and one beast embarked on a long journey to find someone.</p><p>Riding the two-headed beast, Qin Sang’s own cultivation wouldn’t be delayed too much.  He held spirit stones, studying killing talismans during the day and refining his body with starlight at night.</p><p>Though he didn’t take the most bustling route, he occasionally encountered other cultivators. Qin Sang ordered the two-headed beast to avoid them.</p><p>Most cultivators, upon seeing someone riding such a high-level beast, wisely stayed far away. Even those who considered themselves strong cultivators would not dare to approach, seeing Qin Sang's aloof attitude.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang only feared Nascent Soul masters.</p><p>In the vast ocean, he hoped he wouldn't be so unlucky as to encounter a Nascent Soul master.</p><p>Following the planned route, he traveled and cultivated.</p><p>When encountering large islands, Qin Sang would discreetly visit, restock supplies, and experience the local customs. He adhered to his principles, minimizing contact with local powers or large sects to avoid complications.</p><p>The journey was relatively smooth, and Qin Sang gained considerable experience.</p><p>Continuously traveling, Qin Sang drew closer to the Liefeng Islands, entering the southwest sea region.</p><p>The southwest sea region was probably the most chaotic part of the Canglang Sea.  Neither righteous nor demonic cultivators had sufficient control, and there was also the interference of the Witch Clan, stirring up trouble.</p><p>Upon entering the southwest sea region, Qin Sang could no longer travel so openly and preferred a slower pace.</p><p>“After nearly a year of refinement, the power of my wings has doubled, and my flight speed has also increased significantly.  It seems this path was correct…”</p><p>Arriving at an uninhabited sea area, Qin Sang used his magical powers, flapping his wings and flying up and down over the sea.</p><p>Having complete control over his body felt more free and enjoyable than using a magic weapon.</p><p>The two-headed beast trailed behind Qin Sang, its large eyes full of confusion. It couldn’t understand how this person had grown wings out of nowhere.  Could he possess some beast bloodline?</p><p>After having his fill of fun, Qin Sang retracted his wings, landed on the two-headed beast, and consulted the nautical chart.</p><p>“Ahead is an island called Jinhuan Island, occupied by the Jinhuan Sect. This sect is the largest power in the vicinity, with a questionable reputation, somewhere between righteous and demonic. The sect master is a Nascent Soul expert. Let’s just avoid it…”</p><p>Qin Sang drew an arc with his finger, pointing towards the Liefeng Islands and ordering the two-headed beast to proceed.</p><p>After meandering and stopping along the way, they finally arrived near the Liefeng Islands.</p><p>That morning, Qin Sang and the two-headed beast appeared on the sea surface, bathed in the morning sun.</p><p>A long shadow appeared ahead, bringing Qin Sang to a halt.</p><p>“Finally!”</p><p>He sighed with heartfelt relief.  After so long at sea, even his considerable skill couldn't entirely mask his fatigue.</p><p>“This must be Changshe Island, the northernmost point of the Liefeng Archipelago.  The long, slender island resembles a high wall, making it easy to identify. Entering Changshe Island means entering the Liefeng Archipelago. Quheng Island, the archipelago’s main city, lies over three hundred miles south of Changshe Island.  The island’s ruler is a representative of both righteous and demonic cultivators. This area is the safest part of the Liefeng Archipelago; it’s a good place to gather information...”</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his double-headed bird, altering its appearance and concealing its aura before setting off discreetly.</p><p>Passing Changshe Island, a towering dark silhouette soon appeared before him. Quheng Island was a high mountain rising from the sea, its slopes relatively gentle, visible from afar.  Rows of houses encircled the mountain, its peak piercing the clouds, with the faint outlines of palaces visible at the summit.</p><p>Cultivators could be seen constantly flying to and from the island.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly moved to Quheng Island, passing without question. A small fee allowed him entry, though he was required to leave by a set time unless he paid more.</p><p>Unlike other parts of the archipelago, Quheng Island was much like Tianxing Island – orderly and peaceful, without the constant strife.</p><p>Disguised as a low-level cultivator, Qin Sang discreetly inquired about the archipelago, gaining a detailed understanding.</p><p>The Liefeng Archipelago was vast; if the islands were connected, it would be larger than the Wushen Continent, although its environment was far inferior.</p><p>The southern part, in particular, was frequently ravaged by storms.  The storms brought endless, persistent sea fog and powerful sea beasts. This area was a natural haven for demonic cultivators, the situation utterly chaotic, with only the vicinity of Quheng Island offering any semblance of peace.</p><p>However, even the righteous and demonic cultivators could only maintain control over this limited area.  Many cultivators wanted by both sides hid deep within the archipelago, making capture extremely difficult.</p><p>After learning about the Liefeng Archipelago, Qin Sang left Quheng Island that night, continuing south.  However, as he neared Linggui Island, a sudden storm struck.</p><p>He halted his flight, standing on the water, gazing at the sky.</p><p>To the southwest, the sky darkened, heavy clouds gathering like a monstrous beast, consuming everything with terrifying speed.</p><p>The calm before the storm; the air was filled with a deadly stillness, suffocatingly oppressive.</p>
