<h1>Chapter 483: Astonishing Escape Speed</h1><p>The opportunity was fleeting; he couldn't delay any longer!</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his protective formation and flew out of the cave.</p><p>Taking one last look at the cave he had only occupied for a month, Qin Sang erased all traces of his presence, parted the water, and flew directly towards the surface.</p><p>It was daytime, and the water's surface was calm. As far as the eye could see, there were only a few scattered desolate islands, with no sign of human activity.</p><p>Qin Sang revealed himself mid-air. On a whim, with a mere thought, the Ebony Sword flew out from his Nascent Soul.</p><p>The exceptionally pure wood spirit sword embryo floated before Qin Sang, even more mesmerizing under the sunlight.</p><p>The Ebony Sword trembled slightly, faintly emitting a sword cry, seemingly filled with joy.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed casually.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flashed brightly and vanished instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang then shouted, "Return!"</p><p>The Ebony Sword immediately returned, hovering steadily before him. Now, the Ebony Sword's aura had drastically changed, carrying a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at his natal spirit sword. On the pure sword embryo, four Slaughter Seals were neatly arranged, all complete.</p><p>The moment he broke through to the False Core realm, the fourth Slaughter Seal was fully inscribed.</p><p>He could feel the immense benefits the Slaughter Seals brought him, especially in cultivation.</p><p>If he weren't constrained by the Core Formation bottleneck, with his cultivation unable to advance further, the four Slaughter Seals together would allow his cultivation speed to steadily surpass that of a tri-spiritual root cultivator!</p><p>From now on, spiritual roots would no longer be the biggest limitation on his cultivation.</p><p>This kind of 'talent' was not low in the cultivation world.</p><p>Although he didn't know if the Slaughter Seals in the "Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter" would change after entering the Core Formation stage, Qin Sang was already very satisfied.</p><p>However, after inscribing the fourth Slaughter Seal, Qin Sang encountered a problem.</p><p>Originally, after completing a Slaughter Seal, he could smoothly advance to the next realm. After entering Foundation Establishment, Qin Sang no longer knew what a bottleneck was.</p><p>Perhaps comprehending the Slaughter Seals and his natal spirit sword was the bottleneck of the "Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter."</p><p>But Qin Sang already possessed a natal spirit sword of magic treasure level, and this time, it still wasn't enough. He couldn't even draw a single stroke of the fifth Slaughter Seal. Faced with the fifth level of the "Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter," Qin Sang was clueless and at a loss.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that he would have to rely on his own strength to break through this barrier.</p><p>After all, the improvement of minor realms was incomparable to the transformative leap of major realms.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't placed all his hopes on the cultivation method.</p><p>Qin Sang stretched out his hand, gently stroking the Ebony Sword. The sword restrained its killing intent and became very docile.</p><p>A chill emanated from the sword's surface, and a sense of kinship, similar to a blood connection, flowed from it.</p><p>After cultivating to the False Core realm, not only had his cultivation base and divine sense been comprehensively enhanced, but Qin Sang also clearly felt that his control over the Ebony Sword had also reached a new level.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had attempted several times to use the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability while in Sword Unity and performing Sword Flight, but all had ended in failure due to insufficient control.</p><p>Now, it should be possible!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened as he formed a sword incantation. The Ebony Sword hummed softly.</p><p>Sword Light Envelopment!</p><p>Qin Sang's figure vanished, merging with his spirit sword.</p><p>The Ebony Sword emitted a blinding light, no less intense than the scorching sun, and suddenly transformed into a streak of astonishing rainbow light, speeding towards the Chaotic Islands.</p><p>Under the clear sky,</p><p>A dazzling sword light pierced the sky, soaring towards the heavens, startling the fish in the water, causing them to dive to the bottom.</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderclap echoed in broad daylight.</p><p>Amidst the thunder, the sword light's speed abruptly surged.</p><p>Despite the clear, cloudless day, a thick bolt of lightning flashed across the sky.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>As the thunder roared, a low dragon's roar suddenly sounded.</p><p>Though muffled, the dragon's roar was still clearly audible amidst the thunder, carrying the pressure of a great demon.</p><p>The moment the dragon's roar sounded, all creatures in the water were gripped by terror, and the underwater world instantly descended into chaos. Meanwhile, the speed of the sword light, already at its peak in the air, increased even further.</p><p>The dragon's roar was very brief, almost disappearing as soon as it sounded, fading away along with the thunder.</p><p>The sword light's speed plummeted, finally stopping above a desolate stretch of water.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword, his eyes gleaming with excitement. After breaking through to the False Core realm, he had successfully integrated the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability into his escape technique.</p><p>Fellow False Core cultivators could only eat his dust.</p><p>His current cultivation base was still insufficient to fully utilize his magic treasure and divine ability. He believed that after successfully forming his core, his Sword Flight would definitely surpass that of cultivators at the same realm, and perhaps even rival that of mid-Core Formation cultivators!</p><p>What made Qin Sang even more elated was that the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, worthy of being a secret talisman of the Shangyuan Clear Tranquility Palace, could also be effectively used when employing divine abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the Flood Dragon in Boundless Valley. With his current strength, he was no longer afraid of peak Spirit Severing demons. It was time to claim the Flood Dragon's spirit essence!</p><p>With the Sword Qi Thunder Sound and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, his escape speed would be no less than that of early Core Formation experts.</p><p>This was the source of Qin Sang's confidence.</p><p>Even if there were changes with Priest Jiupao, escaping wouldn't be difficult. Moreover, he still had the Void Thunder, and...</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He put away the Ebony Sword and rode the clouds, returning to the Chaotic Islands.</p><p>Quietly entering the grand formation, Qin Sang didn't go to see Senior Brother Rong and the others but headed straight for Mist Island.</p><p>Half a day later, Qin Sang emerged from Mist Island with a somewhat gloomy expression.</p><p>He had learned that Ji Wu hadn't appeared during the recent battle. He had already left the Chaotic Islands!</p><p>It was possible that Ji Wu had taken another route.</p><p>It was also possible that Ji Wu didn't know the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu secret technique.</p><p>He wasn't a remnant of the Kuiyin Sect but had been taken in by Priest Jiupao later.</p><p>When the Kuiyin Sect was destroyed, the remaining insect gu were destroyed along with Yi Tiannie. Without the Heart-Devouring Insect corpses, the secret technique was practically useless, a waste of effort. It was normal for Priest Jiupao not to teach it to Ji Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this.</p><p>He didn't stay long on Mist Island. After meeting with Steward Bao, who wanted to purchase living corpses, he left the True Water Mirage Formation once again.</p><p>...</p><p>Earth Sink Cave.</p><p>Nearly a century had passed, and while circumstances had changed, the baleful aura remained the same.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer feared the cave's chilling cold. He traversed the gaps in the restrictions with familiarity, his figure quietly arriving before the cave dwelling within Earth Sink Cave.</p><p>Inside, a disciple was diligently cultivating. He had prepared many warming artifacts, but the coldness here wasn't easily dispelled, yet he persevered.</p><p>It was here that Qin Sang had slain Sun De, obtaining his first magic treasure, which later played a key role in his victory against Yu Hua.</p><p>Every gain and loss was predestined.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced inside before continuing to descend, finally passing through the layer of yin baleful qi and arriving at the stone platform close to the earth baleful qi.</p><p>He set up a concealing restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the Corpse Puppet Pouch. First, the late Foundation Establishment stage baleful corpses flew out, taking up positions around him for vigilance.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang cautiously took out two 'corpses' that still had a lingering aura but had their consciousness erased, placing them before him.</p><p>Yu Hua and the Yellow-Armored Man.</p>
