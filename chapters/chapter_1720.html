<h1>Chapter 1711: Ascension (Part 1)</h1><p>In the fire chamber.</p><p>A ball of demonic fire pulsed in Qin Sang’s palm.</p><p>The raging demonic fire seemed docile as water before Qin Sang, its aura confined to a small space.  Even if someone stood before him, they would feel no threat.</p><p>Within the demonic fire, an altar slowly rotated.</p><p>Each rotation sent out ripples, but under Qin Sang’s masterful control, the ripples quickly subsided, and the refinement process was exceptionally smooth.</p><p>The altar was the core of the tribulation formation—the Taiji Altar.</p><p>Compared to the one he’d seen in Bingyi Palace, this altar was nearing completion. The forty-nine grooves along the outer edge for placing the ice and fire talismans were all present, only the Yin and Yang poles remained unformed, their runes flickering, and restrictive light emanating.</p><p>The Bingyi Divine Plate and the Huoxi Orb hovered on either side of the demonic fire.</p><p>A chilling aura extended from the Bingyi Divine Plate, connecting to the Yin pole, while a crimson thread connected the Huoxi Orb to the Yang pole.</p><p>The energy from both treasures slowly poured in.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the altar at the heart of the demonic fire, his hand seals changing continuously, meticulously inputting one restriction after another, guiding the two drastically different energies to flow through the altar’s internal meridians.</p><p>If the altar was considered a human body, its internal meridians were the altar’s veins. The meridians circulated, their energy interconnected, merging with the restrictive runes until the treasure was complete!</p><p>Ten years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang had refined the ice and fire talismans quickly. The Taiji Altar was more troublesome.  After shaping the altar, Qin Sang entrusted its meridian refinement to his avatar, a task that took ten years.</p><p>As time passed, one could see that intricate blue and red patterns formed on the altar's surface, centered around the Yin and Yang poles.</p><p>The patterns gradually spread across the altar, meeting in the middle. Under Qin Sang’s exquisite control, they didn’t clash but spread into each other’s territory until the entire altar glowed with a blend of blue and red light, indistinguishable from one another, ultimately merging seamlessly.</p><p>The altar’s spiritual light subsided, and depressions shaped like a spiritual plate and a jade pendant appeared at the Yin and Yang poles, perfectly fitting the two treasures.</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>Extinguishing the demonic fire, Qin Sang let out a long breath and examined the Taiji Altar.</p><p>Then, remembering something, he flipped his palm and successively sent in forty-nine streams of light—the ice and fire talismans—inserting them into the grooves along the altar's outer edge, while the Bingyi Divine Plate and the Huoxi Orb automatically returned to their positions.</p><p>‘嗡!’</p><p>The Taiji Altar vibrated gently.</p><p>The Yin and Yang poles emitted two brilliant beams of light, one blue, one red, followed by the forty-nine ice and fire talismans trembling, as if about to detach from the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't continue to activate it, otherwise, the Yin and Yang poles would create ice and fire pillars, and the tribulation formation would activate.</p><p>His eyes shone with a strange light as he stared for a long time, sensing the changes in energy, his face full of satisfaction.</p><p>The tribulation formation was complete!</p><p>Actually, Bingyi Palace didn't only contain the tribulation formation; there were also restrictions that could record the scenes of the ancestors’ tribulations for later generations to study, but unfortunately, Qin Sang hadn't obtained this method.</p><p>Next, he just needed to place the tribulation formation in a suitable location and wait for the tribulation to begin!</p><p>Putting away the various treasures, Qin Sang left the fire chamber.</p><p>Midday.</p><p>The sun was high in the sky.</p><p>The bright sun shone on Luye.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly in front of the fire chamber's door, surveying the entire Daoist ground, and slowly closed his eyes. Without using his divine sense, he felt a strange sense of merging with heaven and earth, completely forgetting himself.</p><p>With his five elemental spiritual roots, his Nascent Soul-level divine sense, and various advantageous conditions all concentrated on Qin Sang, in his pursuit of the celestial human response, he quickly overcame initial confusion and grasped the key.</p><p>He had achieved minor success in just twenty years, and his progress had been extremely rapid in the past decade.</p><p>For others, such speed was unimaginable.</p><p>Of course, merely achieving a certain level of attainment in the celestial human response was not enough to directly push Qin Sang into the Nascent Soul stage. He still needed to spend a long time comprehending the Dao, reflecting on himself, and seeking a breakthrough opportunity.</p><p>The key was the "Wu Sheng Demon Seal."</p><p>Now, the "Wu Sheng Demon Seal" was nearing completion, only one step away from condensation.</p><p>After years of careful contemplation, Qin Sang confirmed it wasn't an illusion; the Wu Sheng Demon Seal he was condensing truly possessed extraordinary power!</p><p>In addition, Tianmu Butterfly had been cultivating beside Qin Sang the whole time. After completely refining the strange energy of the near-dragon saliva, with the support of spirit-raising methods and various spirit medicines, it had also reached the late peak stage.</p><p>Because the main ingredient for the Qingshuang Pill was still unknown, and Qin Sang had discovered the secret of the Wu Sheng Demon Seal, he no longer focused on helping Tianmu Butterfly break through, instead concentrating his efforts on himself.</p><p>His fourth-transformation peak innate insect Gu also had the ability to assist in the breakthrough.</p><p>With the tribulation formation complete, the conditions for achieving Ascension were largely in place.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, his perception encompassing the entire dojo; every blade of grass, every tree, was as if before his eyes.  His avatar had completed its mission and was resting in its cave dwelling.</p><p>The bamboo forest outside the cave was forbidden. No one in Qingyang Temple, including Shen Chen, dared to approach it.</p><p>A gentle breeze rustled through the bamboo, creating a serene sound.</p><p>Qingyang Temple was located on the other side of Luye, referred to by the disciples as the Inner Temple.  Qin Sang sensed several disciples cultivating within various cave dwellings.  The Temple now had a Golden Core cultivator, and several others were on the verge of breakthrough.</p><p>Before these disciples entered Luye, Shen Chen had led them in ancestral veneration, something Qin Sang vaguely recalled.</p><p>But that was all. Unless a disciple possessed exceptional talent and surpassed their peers in cultivation speed, they wouldn't warrant Qin Sang's special attention.</p><p>Deep within the Inner Temple, a stone chamber with a closed door was Shen Chen's cave dwelling.</p><p>Several noteworthy events had occurred over the years.  Upon Shen Chen's advancement to the Yuan Ying stage, Qin Sang entrusted him with the position of Head Abbot of Qingyang Temple in Central State.</p><p>Shen Chen was naturally gifted. While his avatar was traveling, he fortuitously obtained a breakthrough-enhancing elixir, which he sent back to Luye, aiding his ascension.  His immediate success on his first attempt surprised Qin Sang.  He had initially taken this disciple on due to his talent in artifact refinement; he hadn't expected such outstanding results.</p><p>Central State's Qingyang Temple now had a second Yuan Ying ancestor!</p><p>With Shen Chen in place, the Temple's legacy was secure, allowing Qin Sang to effectively become a hands-off leader.</p><p>The Cloud Touring Sword also underwent significant changes.  Through continuous refinement using the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique*, Qin Sang felt the Jiao Wood spirit becoming more stable and starting to gestate.</p><p>Another development involved the Fire Jade Centipede.  After absorbing the fire spirits from the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool on Fire Rhinoceros Island, the Centipede, having slept for many years, awoke with mid-fourth transformation cultivation.  Qin Sang subsequently sealed and fed it more fire spirits, sending it back to sleep. He wondered if this would propel it to late-fourth transformation.</p><p>Everything was progressing favorably.</p><p>Returning to the present, Qin Sang smiled faintly and descended the stone steps. A few steps down, he heard rustling in the bamboo forest. Suddenly, a dozen greenish-blue lines shot out, lunging towards him.</p><p>The lines landed before Qin Sang, emitting chirping sounds as they lay at his feet.  These were the earthbound dragons raised by Su Zinan, their ferocity removed by Qin Sang, now serving as mountain guardians.</p><p>The earthbound dragons were very close to Qin Sang's aura, rolling onto their backs, their cries expressing urgency.  Qin Sang smiled and flicked out several pills.</p><p>After devouring the pills, the earthbound dragons followed Qin Sang, sometimes in a line, sometimes scattered, frolicking in the bamboo forest until he entered the bamboo building, at which point they returned to their nests.</p><p>Inside the bamboo building, Qin Sang sat upright with a serious expression.</p><p>Using his spiritual sense to introspect, he silently cultivated the *Lifeless Demon Seal*, sensing the nearing completion of the seal and continuing to comprehend it.</p><p>This seclusion lasted ten years.</p><p>One day, the spiritual energy around the bamboo building suddenly became turbulent.</p><p>Qin Sang’s complexion underwent strange changes, his face sometimes losing its color, turning pale, and at other times suffused with a grayish-black aura, as if possessed by demonic energy and fatally ill.  His breathing was irregular, affecting the surrounding environment.</p><p>With a loud *whoosh*, the bamboo building shook. A violent wind swept through the bamboo forest, scattering leaves.</p><p>The earthbound dragons, sensing Qin Sang's aura, trembled in their nests.</p><p>Qin Sang remained oblivious to the external changes, his mind completely absorbed by the inner demon seal. The time had come; he prepared to finalize the seal today!</p><p>Despite his unfinished obsession, Qin Sang disregarded it and forcibly formed the seal.</p><p>By now, the demonic intent was very faint, the seal was no longer a rudimentary form but structurally complete, only needing a final step.  With the obsession incomplete, there were many inconsistencies in the operation of the technique. The seal was constantly on the verge of losing control, making the process exceedingly difficult.</p><p>The greatest danger was triggering a demonic obsession, leading to a loss of mental composure, but Qin Sang's mind remained clear, completely absorbed, and he resolutely pushed forward with the secret technique.</p><p>*Congeal!*  A sudden low shout.</p><p>A deafening roar echoed within Qin Sang's body.  His face flickered between white and black as demonic energy threatened to erupt. He suppressed it forcefully, completing the final incantation.</p><p>Instantly, the demonic energy receded.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a square seal slowly rotating within him. The seal was black and sinister, seeming to draw everything in, including his consciousness.</p><p>"It's finally done!"</p><p>Without pausing to savor his success, Qin Sang immediately began cultivating, focusing on the seal.  As he'd sensed before, the seal was intimately connected to him.  The slightest movement of the seal caused his true essence to vibrate.  He felt instinctively that its power was even greater than he’d anticipated!</p><p>The seal's immense power underscored the terrifying danger he'd faced during the process of channeling the demonic intent; the thought sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>But it was too late to dwell on such things now.</p><p>Qin Sang regained his composure, pondered for a moment, summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly, and retrieved a jade box.</p><p>The butterfly, sensing its master's contemplation of a critical matter, perched quietly on his shoulder.</p><p>He gently opened the box revealing a crystal-clear spiritual fruit—the Lingxi Immortal Fruit.</p><p>The scent of the fruit filled the air.  As Qin Sang's mind merged with the butterfly's, his understanding of the Wu Sheng Demon Seal deepened, the thrill becoming palpable, almost overwhelming.</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>Only his physical body needed refinement.</p><p>But he had seized the opportunity; there was no need to wait any longer!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang rose to his feet.</p><p>At Qingyang Temple, Shen Chen was cultivating when he received a message from his master.  Surprise flickered across his face, followed by a mixture of shock and joy as he recalled something.  He immediately rushed from his cave, roused the other disciples, and brought them back to the lower courtyard.</p><p>When Shen Chen returned, bringing the Moon Guard with him, they saw Qin Sang's external manifestation standing behind him.</p><p>Upon reaching Luye, they felt the mountain tremble as it sped westward.</p><p>Approaching the storm zone, a desolate wasteland ravaged by the Nine Calamities, Luye came to a halt.  Ripples suddenly appeared in the surrounding void.</p><p>White clouds formed spontaneously, filling the sky in layers.</p><p>Then, the clouds churned.</p><p>In the heart of the cloud sea, a mountain range, resembling a dragon with towering peaks, materialized—a hidden daoist temple.</p><p>This explained why Luye's protective array was deactivated, leaving only the array protecting the mountain itself active.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body now stood on Luye's main peak, gazing at the heavens and surveying the earth below.</p><p>The tribulation formation was placed here, connected to the spirit veins, ready for his breakthrough and ascension!</p><p>"Quickly patrol the area and drive away all outsiders!"</p><p>A deep voice echoed in the ears of the Moon Guard.</p><p>The external manifestation led them from Luye, scattering them to carry out the order.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The external manifestation stood atop a mountain peak not far from Luye, with Shen Chen and the Moon Guard stationed at strategic points.</p><p>Within the daoist temple,</p><p>Qin Sang's main body sat cross-legged above the Taiji Altar. The Ice and Fire Order, the Ice Instrument Divine Plate, and the Fire Rhinoceros Seal were all in place.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly circled above Qin Sang, then transformed into a stream of light, entering his forehead.</p><p>The next moment, a thunderous boom reverberated within Qin Sang.</p><p>A wave of black demonic energy surged from an unknown source, engulfing him. The Wu Sheng Demon Seal within him shattered!</p><p>Shattered seal, breakthrough!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Qin Sang's true essence boiled. His dantian and meridians felt as though they were about to burst, waves of agonizing pain washing over him.</p><p>But he remained oblivious to it, in a state of blissful communion with the heavens and earth.</p><p>It felt like merging himself with the cosmos, returning to the source, yet without completely losing his own path; instead, he sought the point of perfect harmony with the heavens and earth, to receive the feedback of the Dao.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang clearly sensed that the moment the Wu Sheng Demon Seal shattered, the bottleneck loosened!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The jade box opened, and the Lingxi Immortal Fruit was swallowed.</p><p>The fruit, his life-bound insect Gu, and the remnants of the Wu Sheng Demon Seal—all their powers exploded simultaneously.</p><p>In an instant, the previously vague path became crystal clear; he had finally grasped the ultimate truth!</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, his voice echoing through the heavens!</p><p>Above Luye, dark clouds gathered, thunderbolts crashed, and the world's spiritual energy raged violently. Within the howling spiritual tide, the energy roiled, creating countless differently colored orbs that floated around Qin Sang and Luye, descending from the sky.</p><p>An immense pressure emanated from Luye's main peak.</p><p>Even the Moon Guard, Yuan Ying cultivators stationed outside Luye, felt an involuntary tremor as the pressure bore down on them.</p><p>The celestial omen continued, with colorful clouds and streaks of light painting the sky, followed by wind and thunder, plunging the world into chaos. Finally, a familiar wave of energy was felt, and a flickering, formless flame was seen at the heart of the storm.</p><p>"The Yin Fire Tribulation! Master… succeeded!"</p><p>A Moon Guard almost groaned the words, gazing at Luye with a mixture of awe and reverence.</p><p>On Luye's main peak,</p><p>Qin Sang, oblivious to himself and the world, endured the burning Yin Fire.</p><p>The tribulation formation had activated.  The two polar treasures shone brightly, emitting icy and fiery pillars. Forty-nine Ice and Fire Orders broke free from their slots, rising into the air and circling Qin Sang ceaselessly.</p><p>The Orders channeled the ice and fire energies; the two mutually antagonistic forces converged, forming a single stream that flowed around Qin Sang without ceasing.</p><p>Under the protection of this energy, the Yin Fire swirling around him visibly weakened, losing its initial ferocity.</p>
