<h1>Chapter 1409: Fiery Inferno</h1><p>Elsewhere,</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions found themselves in a similar predicament.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Waves of intensely hot winds relentlessly battered them.  Besides the wind, there was nothing else visible in all directions, above or below, offering no points of reference to determine their location.</p><p>Initially, these winds didn't seem particularly unusual.</p><p>Only upon direct contact did their true power become apparent.  The winds carried not only scorching flames, but also an unidentified golden substance, like liquid gold.</p><p>Ordinary protective measures proved ineffective against this golden substance.  Qin Sang and his companions tried several protective techniques, their bodies radiating various glows, but once they encountered the golden substance, they were as fragile as paper, pierced through without resistance.</p><p>However, attempts to collect this golden substance for study proved futile.  No matter the method employed, it vanished before their very eyes.</p><p>This bizarre phenomenon was entirely unknown to all four of them.</p><p>Fortunately, the golden substance wasn't inexhaustible.  It wasn't present in every gust of wind, allowing for intervals of respite.  This gave them significantly more leeway.</p><p>"It ignores spiritual energy…such a thing exists in this world?!"</p><p>The Qi cultivator exclaimed, imagining the havoc they could wreak if they could control this substance.  It seemed to completely negate the powers of all cultivators who relied on spiritual energy, which comprised almost all cultivators in the current cultivation world.</p><p>"This might not be genuinely real,"</p><p>Master Mu stared intently at a silver shield in his hand. The shield was one of his protective treasures, which had just transformed into a ten-foot-tall shield, blocking a gust of wind for them.  Several streaks of the golden liquid now adhered to its surface.</p><p>Just as Master Mu was about to act, a flash of golden light appeared, and the familiar scene repeated itself—the liquid vanished without a trace.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Master Mu said, "It's most likely an outward manifestation of the array's power.  This power surpasses our cultivation level; hence its bizarre appearance."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, nodding slowly in agreement. He too felt that even if such a miraculous treasure existed, the Jing Hai Sect would never use it for an array.  They'd refine it into artifacts, one for each member—wouldn't the Jing Hai Sect become invincible?  The Northern Sea cultivators would be at their mercy.</p><p>The more likely explanation was that the array, or the cultivator who created it, was far beyond their comprehension.</p><p>"This is the Jing Hai Sect's protective formation, not the kind of ancient, fragmented array found in Zi Wei Palace.  Not only is its origin extraordinary, but its creator is at least a Grand Cultivator.  Could it be…Such a powerful force, such a strong cultivator, why are they unknown in the Northern Sea?"</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang, prompting his curiosity. Recalling the various legends and strange tales he'd heard in the Northern Sea, he hadn't heard of any Nascent Soul-stage Buddhist masters.</p><p>At this moment, Master Mu added, "The wind infused with the golden liquid only appears at intervals, supporting our hypothesis. It likely takes time for the array to build up its power."</p><p>"Even so, it's not good news for us,"</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Wang sighed. "If it were only the golden liquid, that would be fine, but those winds infused with the Fiery Inferno are incredibly powerful. Combined with the golden substance, they can penetrate any artifact without hindrance.  None of our natal treasures are for defense, the highest quality is my top-grade Thousand-Line Armor. If we're trapped here too long, I fear it'll damage our treasures.”</p><p>The Thousand-Line Armor was the turtle-shell-like treasure the Wang cultivator had previously summoned.</p><p>Such defensive treasures, famed for their hardness, were rare. Usually, a cultivator’s most powerful treasure is their natal treasure, as it's the easiest to upgrade.</p><p>Among the four,</p><p>Master Mu cultivated natal insect-gu, his snake spear was both offensive and defensive, but the snake armor it transformed into was useless against the golden liquid.  His silver shield was of lesser quality than the Wang cultivator's Thousand-Line Armor.</p><p>Both Qi and Wang were only in the Nascent Soul Initial Stage; their natal treasures hadn’t even reached top-grade.  Fortunately, Wang cultivator unexpectedly obtained the Thousand-Line Armor; otherwise, their situation would be even more dire.</p><p>Even Qin Sang's most reliable treasures weren't very effective.</p><p>"If only I still had the Nine-Lives Xuanwu Armor,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought silently.  With its quality, there would be no cause for worry. In recent years, he’d focused on refining the Sun God Tree and Jin Chen Sword, leaving him with only a few hastily refined defensive treasures for show. A mid-grade bronze mirror floated before his chest; its surface bore several dents from the recent impact.</p><p>"The Fiery Inferno's presence is a double-edged sword," Qin Sang channeled his spiritual energy, smoothing out the bronze mirror, interjecting.  "The Jing Hai Sect's protective array is so powerful. If it weren't for the Fiery Inferno impacting it, causing changes in the array, even creating fissures, the Myriad Spirits Fruit's aura wouldn’t have spread. Otherwise, the Fire Jade Centipede wouldn't have sensed the Myriad Spirits Fruit so easily."</p><p>"Excellent! Every disadvantage has its advantage!  Besides, we've been inside for quite some time now, and the formation hasn't changed at all.  It's a static formation; breaking it shouldn't be difficult, it will just take some time."</p><p>Mu Guzhu nodded heavily, agreeing with Qin Sang's assessment. "Daoist, can the Fire Jade Centipede sense the Myriad Spirits Fruit now?"</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang nodded slightly. "The various auras inside the formation are intertwined; it can only pinpoint a general direction."</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang pointed to the left.</p><p>The other three looked in that direction.</p><p>The scene there was no different from any other direction.</p><p>"For us, any direction is the same. Instead of aimlessly searching for the formation's weakness, let's just go there!"</p><p>Mu Guzhu made an immediate decision.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had no objections and immediately changed direction, flying towards the boundless space on the left.</p><p>During their flight.</p><p>Waves of strange winds continuously assaulted them.</p><p>They had experience dealing with this, so they passed without incident.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't forget to observe Mu Guzhu's every move.</p><p>He suspected a close connection between the Jinghai Sect and the Witch Clan.</p><p>Mu Guzhu knew far more about the Jinghai Sect than he let on, hiding a great deal of information.</p><p>With other Nascent Soul cultivators potentially arriving at any moment, obtaining the Jinghai Sect treasure as quickly as possible was the priority. If Mu Guzhu knew anything that could help break the formation, it was time for him to reveal it.</p><p>The result, however, left Qin Sang somewhat perplexed.</p><p>Mu Guzhu seemed genuinely ignorant of the sect-protecting formation.</p><p>"Could it be that the founder of Hundred Flowers Valley received the Witch Clan inheritance elsewhere, and it truly has nothing to do with the Jinghai Sect? Was this just a coincidence?" Qin Sang began to doubt his judgment.</p><p>However, it was best not to jump to conclusions before entering the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind: after obtaining the Myriad Spirits Fruit, he would secretly follow Mu Guzhu.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang's thoughts wandered,</p><p>The formation finally changed. As time passed, the frequency and intensity of the strange winds gradually increased, putting increasing pressure on them.</p><p>Unknowingly, they had been flying through this space for two hours and still hadn't reached the end!</p>
