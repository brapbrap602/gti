<h1>Chapter 1794: Enlightenment</h1><p>Boom!</p><p>Li Hou, propelled by the sword light, crashed to the ground, his head twisted at an unnatural angle, his life extinguished.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed out lightly, his blood surging violently.</p><p>Although the fragment of the True Treasure was powerful, its consumption of True Essence was terrifying, beyond the capacity of ordinary cultivators.  The Dao Tree, which had absorbed a vast amount of wood spirit energy, couldn't completely withstand the impact; its vitality showed signs of fluctuation. This battle was far from easy.</p><p>His main constraint was his divine sense.</p><p>Setting up such a complex sword array, sealing the heavens and earth, and trapping a mid-stage Nascent Soul demon lord, demanded an extremely high level of divine sense.</p><p>As time passed, Li Hou repeatedly attacked the sword array, constantly analyzing its patterns.  Unbeknownst to him, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, but his mind was extremely tense.</p><p>He had to reserve enough divine sense to suppress the Qilin Primordial Seed; otherwise, his efforts would be in vain.  He had to carefully manage his remaining divine sense.</p><p>He had to maintain both the sword array and the energy shield, while also reserving enough power to deploy the Four-Ride Serpent Seal treasure at any moment to guard against Li Hou's desperate counterattack.</p><p>The energy released by a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator at the point of death would undoubtedly be incredibly powerful.</p><p>Even if Li Hou had a last-ditch, mutually destructive technique, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised; he remained vigilant.</p><p>"After receiving the Five Thunders Secret Technique, my True Essence has been fully restored, but before refining the Qilin Primordial Seed, I still need to rely heavily on my physical body…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, looking up at the sky.</p><p>Having successfully hunted Li Hou, the crisis was not over; there were uninvited guests nearby.</p><p>His battle with Li Hou ended, but the tremors in the forest space had not stopped; thunder continued to roar from the heavens, growing increasingly intense.</p><p>Green streaks appeared on the celestial barrier, stretching across the sky—manifestations of violent impacts causing the barrier to tear.</p><p>From the aura seeping in, it could be sensed that the source of the tremors was not the chaos caused by the golden light, but cultivators battling nearby!</p><p>He didn't know who the combatants were or which side was gaining the upper hand.</p><p>Fearing that unforeseen events might arise, Qin Sang didn't dare delay. He had no intention of capturing Li Hou alive, launching a full-scale attack to eliminate him.</p><p>Even without unforeseen circumstances, the chance of capturing him alive was slim; the corpse of a mid-stage Nascent Soul demon lord was enough to exchange for advancement qualification.</p><p>He had to thank the uninvited guests outside; they gave Li Hou a glimmer of hope for survival, making the desire to live outweigh the desire for vengeance, eliminating his suicidal intent.  Further, his agitated spirit in the face of death gave the Heaven-Severing Soul-Slaying Needle an opening. The intense poison entered his body, and he died without resistance.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The celestial barrier was composed of green energy; the powerful fluctuations from outside caused the energy to surge.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang looked towards the barrier, a section of it caved inward, as if an immense force from beyond the heavens was striking down, about to smash the sky.  Cracks immediately appeared in the indentation.</p><p>Through the cracks, Qin Sang saw a familiar petite figure, slamming into the celestial barrier, letting out a cry of surprise.</p><p>"Elder Youhuang!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>Elder Youhuang was standing on a large, silver-colored spirit flower, which grew amidst numerous thick vines.  The vines, like snakes, writhed around Elder Youhuang.  As they struck the celestial barrier, the vines huddled together, protecting her.</p><p>It was visible to the naked eye that a powerful gray aura had knocked Elder Youhuang away.</p><p>Elder Youhuang wasn't injured, but some of the vines protecting her were broken and withered, losing almost half their number in that single strike.</p><p>Immediately, the vines burrowed deeply into the celestial barrier, forcibly stabilizing themselves in the void.  Elder Youhuang, without hesitation, threw out a blue pearl.</p><p>The pearl transformed into a long ribbon, swirling in the void.  Though seemingly light and fragile, its movements produced the sound of wind and thunder, striking powerfully to disperse the pursuing gray energy.</p><p>At the same time, a figure flew towards them, blocking Elder Youhuang.</p><p>This person, clad in armor, exuded a tidal wave of vital energy. Standing in the void, they were like an unyielding pillar, their spirit spear pointed diagonally forward.</p><p>"Elder Guyun, I didn't expect them to not be separated…"</p><p>As Qin Sang recognized their identities, Elder Youhuang also caught sight of Qin Sang below.  A hint of joy flashed across her tense face, quickly replaced by a serious expression.  Her lips parted slightly, as if she wanted to say something.</p><p>At that moment, the gray energy, repulsed by the ribbon, quickly coalesced, finally forming a gray orb in the hands of a burly man.</p><p>A powerfully built man with unnervingly grey-white eyes and webbed fingers, clearly not human, stood beside a strikingly beautiful woman adorned in a jeweled crown and colorful robes.  A pure crystal embedded in her forehead pulsed with shifting rainbow light, making her even more stunning than the renowned Youhuang Zhenren.  Yet, her almond-shaped eyes held a chilling intensity.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren and his companion were outnumbered but losing ground.</p><p>"See how far you can run!" the crowned woman shrieked.  Her forehead crystal blazed, unleashing five beams of light.</p><p>These five colored rays, sharp as spirit blades, shot towards the two cultivators.  The strong man, not to be outdone, swallowed a grey orb, leaped, and with a bulging throat, expelled a blast of grey mist.</p><p>A strange, oppressive force filled the air, creating a cloud above the two cultivators. They felt a crushing sensation, as if plunged deep underwater, the light and even the very fabric of space distorting around them. A terrifying sense of helplessness washed over them.</p><p>Gongyang Zhenren stood firm, his spirit spear multiplying into countless shadows before coalescing into a single, powerful thrust aimed at the rainbow light. He ignored the grey cloud above.</p><p>Meanwhile, Youhuang Zhenren's swirling ribbon, twisting into a rune-like shape, struck the grey cloud with a resounding boom.</p><p>The two cultivators, one from the Dragon Tiger Sect and the other from the Golden Seal Sect, fought in perfect harmony.  However, their opponents were stronger; the man matched their strength, but the woman was a mid-stage Xuan Hollow realm demon lord!</p><p>Initially, like Qin Sang, the two cultivators had sought refuge together after becoming separated from their group.  They had reunited only to encounter these powerful foes.  Their combined efforts were barely enough to survive; otherwise, they would have surely perished.  Harried and desperate, they fought defensively, hoping for the golden light to fade so they could signal for help.</p><p>While unleashing his ribbon, Youhuang Zhenren subtly repaired a rift in the spatial barrier, concealing the scene below. He urgently transmitted, "Quickly recover, Qingfeng Daoist. We can hold on a little longer."</p><p>Having just slain a demon lord, Qin Sang was severely weakened and hadn't had time to recover.  Even through the barrier, Youhuang Zhenren sensed his abnormal state.  A cultivator of Youhuang Zhenren's level wouldn't simply shift responsibility; he bought Qin Sang time to recover, knowing their chances of repelling the enemy depended on his participation.</p><p>However, the rift had barely closed when Youhuang Zhenren heard a tearing sound behind him.  Two withered, gigantic hands burst through the barrier, seizing the air, and ripped it open, creating a hundred-meter-long fissure.</p><p>The violent disturbance drew everyone's attention to a tree-like giant emerging from the rift, its eyes blazing with rage, fixated on the two demon lords.  At the same time, they glimpsed the forest below.</p><p>Most striking was a deep pit in the forest's center, where a mud-caked badger lay motionless.</p><p>The two demon lords' faces paled.</p><p>"Li Hou!"</p><p>The man's puffed cheeks froze, his shock palpable. He shuddered, involuntarily recoiling from an unseen force.  The crowned woman, confirming the badger's identity, was equally stunned.  Li Hou, a cultivator of comparable strength, had been dispatched on a crucial mission, and now lay dead.</p><p>"This person…" The woman’s gaze sharpened, fixing on Qin Sang.  This seemingly neither human nor demon being had killed Li Hou, despite being weaker.  Was his power extraordinary, or did he have help?</p><p>A sudden apprehension gripped her. Exchanging a look with the man, they turned and fled without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't pursue them. He had no desire to hunt further; his spiritual sense was limited, the effects of his Dingzhen Pill were waning, and his Spirit Wood body was constrained to the forest.  Using Li Hou's corpse to scare them off was the perfect solution.</p><p>Once he was sure they had truly retreated, Qin Sang nodded to the two cultivators before returning to the forest.  The cultivators descended, bowing their thanks.</p><p>Qin Sang, having reverted to his true form, quickly moved through the forest, gathering a few treasures.</p><p>All belonged to Li Hou, won in a desperate battle.  Unfortunately, even his bone-piercing spikes couldn't decisively defeat Qin Sang; they only slowed his advance.</p><p>After clearing the battlefield, Qin Sang flew to the deep pit.</p><p>Small trees had already sprung up around the pit, growing rapidly, forming a canopy in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Two True Immortals hovered above the pit, watching Qin Sang work. They exchanged a glance.</p><p>After a long pause, Youhuang True Immortal softly asked, "That...was Li Hou?"</p><p>Qin Sang put away the demonic corpse, nodding and smiling. "It was my good fortune, encountering a heavily wounded Li Hou.  Speaking of which, I must thank you both; you distracted Li Hou at the last moment, giving me the opportunity."</p><p>"Is that so? Congratulations, Qingfeng Daoist..."</p><p>Guyun True Immortal chuckled dryly.</p><p>He surveyed the surroundings. The vegetation here grew incredibly fast; in a short time, much of the evidence of their duel had already been erased, seeming to cause little lasting damage.</p><p>This explanation was barely acceptable to them.</p><p>Li Hou rarely appeared on the battlefield, and wasn't well-known, yet he was a mid-stage Cave Xuan cultivator, comparable to the female demon who had been hunting them.</p><p>To say that Qin Sang single-handedly killed Li Hou at his peak was simply unbelievable.</p><p>However, judging from the flow of true energy around Qin Sang, they deduced that he had taken a Stabilizing True Pill, indicating that the battle had not been easy.</p><p>Being able to kill a wounded Li Hou was enough to prove his extraordinary strength.</p><p>They didn't seem to question it further.</p><p>Youhuang True Immortal said, "Demons and spirits might gather reinforcements; we can't stay here long! I recall a relatively safe illusionary space; we can take shelter there, wait for the golden light to dissipate, then contact the other True Immortals. If we can't reach them, we'll leave Jushan first, then decide what to do."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>The three immediately escaped the forest space.  This time, with help to counteract the fluctuations of the illusion, Qin Sang allowed his Sky-Eye Butterfly to focus on vigilance.</p><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Finally, they arrived at a peculiar place.</p><p>It resembled an upside-down grey windbag; visible air currents were being sucked into it, emitting a whistling sound.</p><p>"This is it. A fellow cultivator was once accidentally sucked in, and discovered it was just a space made of wind, no danger at all.  Those unaware wouldn't dare enter, making it perfect for hiding..."</p><p>Youhuang True Immortal pointed at the windbag, explaining.</p><p>Then, the three investigated further, confirming that the interior of the windbag showed no unusual changes, and entered.</p><p>A piercing wind howled in their ears.</p><p>The wind was ordinary, strong but insignificant to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>After a brief exchange with the two True Immortals, Qin Sang chose a spot, closed his eyes, and sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p>The two True Immortals watched Qin Sang, their expressions varied, before also sitting down to adjust their breathing.</p><p>The windbag space was far from tranquil.</p><p>Qin Sang guarded his mind, replaying the battle, quickly immersing himself in cultivation.</p><p>What engrossed him was naturally the "Chapter on Nurturing the Sword Soul."</p><p>This was not an ideal cultivation place, but Qin Sang found that after his fierce battle with Li Hou, he gained a deeper understanding of his cultivation techniques and the Dao of Killing, and his gains far exceeded his expectations!</p><p>It was far greater than what he'd received from hunting the Thunder Turtle and the Wood Dragon.</p><p>"Why was the harvest so great this time?"</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>All three opponents were mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, but Li Hou was at his peak, and Qin Sang had defeated him alone.</p><p>In that battle, he had given his all.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>Qin Sang had a sudden realization, recalling his experience in cultivating this technique.</p><p>Before Golden Core, he understood the intent of slaughter through endless killing; his killing intent was overwhelming. After breaking through to Yuan Ying, the killing intent of this technique began to lessen; indiscriminate killing was useless.</p><p>At the Nascent Soul stage, did he need to constantly challenge stronger opponents, tempering himself in life and death, to comprehend the true meaning of the Dao of Killing?</p><p>This thought, coupled with the scriptures of the cultivation technique, made Qin Sang feel he had found the right path.</p><p>This caused Qin Sang to frown.</p><p>Throughout his cultivation, he had always sought stability. Unless it involved a struggle for opportunity, he rarely took risks, and he would never fight against cultivators of a higher realm unless he was certain of victory.</p><p>But if he wanted to quickly comprehend the true meaning of the Dao of Killing and improve his cultivation, he had to constantly challenge stronger opponents.</p><p>His style conflicted with this cultivation technique; he needed to carefully consider how to balance them.</p><p>Fortunately, he wasn't weak among Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang collected his thoughts.  Feeling the effect of the Stabilizing True Pill waning and his true energy becoming chaotic, he suppressed his true energy to the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>During this time, Youhuang True Immortal periodically left the windbag, releasing talismans, using several before finally getting a response!</p><p>"It's Zhijien True Immortal and Zhang True Immortal,"</p><p>Youhuang True Immortal returned to the windbag, showing the talismans to the others. "They're together, not far from us. They want us to join them quickly; they say there are other cultivators with them."</p><p>"Who else is here now?" Guyun True Immortal asked.</p><p>"The golden light hasn't completely dissipated; I didn't get a chance to find out.  It seems to be people from the Daoist Court," Youhuang True Immortal replied.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditation, sensing the inquiring gazes of the two True Immortals, and murmured, "Let's go."</p>
