<h1>Chapter 625: The Witch Clan's Gift</h1><p>Chapter 625: The Witch Clan's Gift</p><p>This world is full of mysteries!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed with emotion.</p><p>The storm surrounding the Outer Sea, I wonder if it's like the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, a remnant effect from a great battle of ancient powerful beings?</p><p>Are there hidden realms and ancient treasures within?</p><p>If I have the chance, I should take a look at the edge of the storm.</p><p>After studying the topographical map, Qin Sang felt a sense of grounding, a sense of stability.</p><p>As for the nautical chart of the Outer Sea, I can obtain that after leaving the Western Frontier, when I encounter the Witch God Continent or high-level human cultivators.  There's no rush.</p><p>The Witch God Continent, the Outer Sea, the Stormy Demon Sea…</p><p>Qin Sang is still unsure where to go. For now, he doesn't plan to leave the Western Frontier; he'll make plans later.</p><p>Withdrawing his consciousness from the topographical map, Qin Sang opened another jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained the Five Insect Sect's true teachings on insect control.</p><p>After reading the jade slip, Qin Sang’s face showed a look of surprise. He immediately opened the last jade slip and examined it for a long time before putting it away, lost in thought.</p><p>The Witch Clan's insect-gu system is completely different from that of Xiaohan Region. This difference lies not only in the distinctions between the Witch Insect List and the Strange Insect List, but also in the identification and transformation of spirit insects.</p><p>Spirit insects possess the strength comparable to Qi Condensation cultivators upon birth.</p><p>In Xiaohan Region, cultivators generally believe that a spirit insect's first transformation after birth is its "First Transformation," similar to a cultivator's Foundation Establishment.  After this transformation, their strength increases dramatically, comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators or Spirit Transformation-stage demonic beasts.</p><p>However, the Witch Clan calls the birth of a spirit insect the "First Transformation."  Humans have a mortal stage before the Qi Condensation stage, but these spirit insects possess extraordinary power from birth, having undergone a transformation before hatching.</p><p>After the First Transformation, it's similar to a cultivator's Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>Second Transformation, Foundation Establishment…</p><p>Third Transformation, Nascent Soul…</p><p>And so on, until the Ninth Transformation, transcending tribulation to become an immortal!</p><p>Witch Clan mythology speaks of a spirit silkworm undergoing nine transformations to become an immortal. That silkworm was the Witch God's gu insect. Whether or not it was the Witch God's primary gu insect remains unconfirmed.</p><p>Comparing the two different accounts, Qin Sang felt that the Yuling Sect and Xiaohan Region's understanding of spirit insects was inferior to the Witch Clan's. After all, there aren't many cultivators who specialize in insect control, and spirit insects are rare in Xiaohan Region.</p><p>Although much knowledge obtained from ancient texts contains brilliant insights, it's unsystematic, a hodgepodge pieced together by later generations.</p><p>In contrast, the Witch Clan's system is more complete. Their insect control techniques are more detailed, have a longer history, and are more credible.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to follow the Witch Clan's system in the future, integrating the Yuling Sect's knowledge into it.</p><p>Although this knowledge isn't as comprehensive as the Witch Clan's, it contains much from ancient texts found on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, representing the wisdom of ancient cultivators—wisdom the Witch Clan lacks.</p><p>This includes methods for cultivating and assisting the transformation of several rare and precious strange insects.</p><p>These strange insects are extinct in Xiaohan Region.  He wonders if they can be found on the Witch God Continent.</p><p>However, this was expected. What surprised Qin Sang most was the concept of the primary gu insect.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang's understanding of the Witch Clan was superficial. He thought they were no different from humans, their cultivation methods being largely similar—inhaling the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, following the path of Foundation Establishment and Nascent Soul.</p><p>Only the Witch Clan's primary gu insect was something he hadn't seen before.</p><p>Reading the jade slip, he learned that the Witch Clan are born with a wondrous affinity for nature. This innate ability allows them to communicate with nature and easily interact with spirit insects, something humans lack.</p><p>Even ordinary Witch Clan members are proficient in insect control, almost innately so.</p><p>When Qin Sang was hiding in Qianhu Village, he saw ordinary people raising poisonous insects.</p><p>Some ordinary people, by chance, might even be acknowledged by transformed spirit insects. If a cultivator is careless, they could even be killed by an ordinary person.</p><p>Thanks to this innate ability, the Witch Clan was able to create the primary gu insect secret technique.</p><p>Cultivating this technique allows one to subdue a spirit insect at the sixth level of the Qi Condensation stage, storing it in the dantian, connecting with it through the mind, and nourishing it with one's essence blood.</p><p>Some cultivation methods require refining a special artifact before the Nascent Soul stage to complement cultivation, acting as a primary artifact, similar to a black wood sword.</p><p>However, the "Chapter on Cultivating the Sword with the Primordial Spirit" is unique in daring to cultivate a sword with the primordial spirit at a low cultivation level—unparalleled.</p><p>Others, like Mu Yifeng, choose an artifact to be constantly with them, doing everything to enhance it, continuing to improve it to the level of a treasure after forming a Nascent Soul, using it as their primary treasure.</p><p>But if one chooses a primary gu insect, one cannot do these things.</p><p>After Nascent Soul, the primary gu insect will take the place of the primary treasure.</p><p>The primary treasure is extremely important to a cultivator.</p><p>Without a primary treasure, if the primary gu insect cannot be successfully cultivated, the cultivator's strength will be greatly impaired, far weaker than those of the same cultivation level.</p><p>Beyond that, there is an even greater risk.</p><p>After a spirit insect is refined into a primary gu insect, it must be nourished with the cultivator's essence blood, also known as a blood gu.</p><p>Over time, the more blood a soul-bound insect consumes, the more ferocious and violent it becomes, easily turning on its master.</p><p>The insect's original consciousness cannot be erased; otherwise, it becomes a dead insect, losing its vitality and potential for improvement, rendering it useless.</p><p>Witch-cultivators, due to their innate talent, can soothe the insect and have stronger control over their soul-bound insect.</p><p>Human cultivators can also cultivate the soul-bound insect technique, but lacking this innate talent, they face significant limitations.  They often lose control when the insect reaches the same cultivation level.</p><p>Therefore, painstakingly cultivating a soul-bound insect, only to miss out on its most valuable benefit, is like having a useless treasure.</p><p>Because the soul-bound insect has an amazing benefit—it assists in breakthrough cultivation!</p><p>This effect is even present during major breakthroughs like Foundation Establishment and Golden Core!</p><p>When a cultivator reaches the False Core stage, if their soul-bound insect is also cultivated to the peak of its second transformation, merging with it during the Golden Core breakthrough can increase the chances of success.</p><p>This only works if the soul-bound insect's cultivation is on par with the cultivator's; otherwise, it's ineffective.</p><p>Furthermore, if the soul-bound insect achieves its third transformation before its master, the effect is even better.</p><p>Of course, the risk of the insect turning on its master is also significantly greater!</p><p>Human cultivators, even if they steal the soul-bound insect secrets from the Witch Clan, dare not allow their insect to transform and surpass them.  Only a very few Witch-cultivators, relying on their innate talent, dare to do this, and they must constantly be wary of backlash.</p><p>Rumor has it that this effect persists even during the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>There's even a story of a Witch Clan ancestor who, guided by their soul-bound insect, forged a different path—a very dark one.</p><p>This is a rumor circulating from outside, so shocking that cultivators in the Western Frontier doubt its veracity.</p><p>The rumored individual's surname was Fang.  His soul-bound insect prematurely achieved its fourth transformation.</p><p>However, he was unlucky; despite the help of his soul-bound insect, he failed multiple attempts at Nascent Soul breakthrough.  Finally, nearing the end of his lifespan and with no hope of achieving Nascent Soul, he abandoned his physical body and merged his soul with his soul-bound insect!</p>
