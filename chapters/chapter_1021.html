<h1>Chapter 1113: The Yao and the Wu</h1><p>King Nine Phoenix sat cross-legged on a rock, her hand seals changing constantly, streams of light dancing around her fingertips.</p><p>After a while, the streams of light intertwined, transforming into a colorful phoenix the size of a hand.  It seemed alive, its eyes full of life.</p><p>The colorful phoenix circled above King Nine Phoenix's head, its wings scattering specks of light.</p><p>King Nine Phoenix raised her head slightly, gazing at the phoenix with her eyes. Her lips moved as she performed an arcane technique. Then, she extended a finger, forcing out a drop of blood essence, which she gently touched to the phoenix.</p><p>The moment her finger made contact, the blood essence was absorbed into the phoenix.</p><p>The phoenix stiffened, then suddenly folded its wings, transforming into a streak of brilliant light that shot into King Nine Phoenix's forehead.</p><p>The phoenix entered her body.</p><p>King Nine Phoenix's head snapped back, her body trembling, and her beautiful face contorted in pain.  A muffled groan escaped her throat, and her aura suddenly exploded.</p><p>King Flood Dragon, prepared for this, waved his hand, sending out a golden light that formed a barrier, sealing the entire mountain hollow.</p><p>In the next moment, the groan transformed into a clear phoenix cry.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Wings unfurled from her back.</p><p>King Nine Phoenix hovered in the air, turning to gaze towards the Immortal Restriction, a strange light flickering in her eyes.</p><p>The armored warrior and the other Yao, suppressing their curiosity, watched King Nine Phoenix's actions in silence.</p><p>Before long, King Nine Phoenix slowly exhaled and nodded to King Flood Dragon.</p><p>King Flood Dragon's expression relaxed. He then spoke, addressing the armored warrior, "Brother Hei, there's no need to worry. King Nine Phoenix and I have made thorough preparations. There's a Heavenly Phoenix True Feather within the Immortal Restriction. Once those cultivators enter the inner hall, we can use the power of the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather to open a passage within the restriction, undetected, and enter."</p><p>"Heavenly Phoenix True Feather?"</p><p>The armored warrior was startled and shocked. "Could it be the legendary true feather of the ancient Heavenly Phoenix?  Your Yao Sea is so abundant, yet you were still able to find such a treasure?"</p><p>King Flood Dragon smiled faintly. "It may not be a true Heavenly Phoenix True Feather, but that fragmented feather does contain a trace of spatial power similar to the Heavenly Phoenix's. We can use it, while the Seven Slaughter Palace emerges and the restriction weakens, to slip inside. This treasure is a prized possession of the Phoenix Clan, the only one in the entire Yao Sea. I spent a great deal of effort persuading the Phoenix Clan to entrust the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather to King Nine Phoenix and bring it to the Boundless Sea."</p><p>The armored warrior exchanged glances with the other great Yao.</p><p>"Did you bribe a cultivator to smuggle the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather inside beforehand?" the armored warrior asked.</p><p>King Flood Dragon nodded.</p><p>"Using the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather to breach the restriction would cause tremors, alerting the human cultivators inside. If we attract their top experts, our situation would become perilous.</p><p>"During the last opening of the Seven Slaughter Palace, King Nine Phoenix ventured in and placed the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather within the restriction, which alarmed a number of cultivators. Now, we simply need to activate the power of the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather to bring us inside, which will create far less disturbance.</p><p>"For this, the various Yao clans have spared no expense, even sacrificing their chosen children. My own son is among them. Having paid such a heavy price, I naturally have a degree of confidence in this plan.</p><p>"Encountering you fellow Daoists in the Boundless Sea was an unexpected boon. If we succeed, I have hopes of reaching God Transformation, and you fellow Daoists will also reap immense benefits.</p><p>"Then, why should we fear cultivators any longer, hiding in the barren depths of the sea?"</p><p>King Nine Phoenix's eyes dimmed, recalling the incredulous looks of the younger generation twenty years ago when they learned the truth, including Caiyi, whom she had watched grow up.</p><p>The armored warrior and the other Yao were astonished to hear these secrets from King Flood Dragon. After conferring amongst themselves, they asked, "When do you two fellow Daoists plan to enter?"</p><p>King Flood Dragon glanced towards the Seven Slaughter Palace. "Once those human cultivators enter the inner hall, we'll move immediately.  We know very little about the Seven Slaughter Palace, so we'll need your assistance then."</p><p>The armored warrior said in a deep voice, "We've been oppressed by cultivators for too long. We will give our all."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>King Flood Dragon clapped his hands and laughed, his gaze fixed on the inner hall within the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>The Yao waited patiently in the mountain hollow.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>King Flood Dragon suddenly said, "Let's move!"</p><p>With a few flashes, the Yao arrived at the edge of the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>King Nine Phoenix and King Flood Dragon stood at the forefront, with the other Yao following behind.</p><p>King Nine Phoenix, now in her true form, beat her wings and took out a magnificent phoenix feather. Flying close to the restriction, she let out a series of rapid chirps towards the inside.</p><p>Within the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>The long plume reappeared, echoing King Nine Phoenix's call, burning with intense flames.</p><p>In the next moment, the feather in King Nine Phoenix's hand shone brightly, and the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather suddenly erupted in a burst of flames, dispelling the surrounding darkness.</p><p>Embedded in the restriction, the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather began to resonate with the feather in King Nine Phoenix's hand, a strange wave passing between them.</p><p>King Nine Phoenix chirped softly.</p><p>King Flood Dragon's expression shifted slightly. He led the Yao closer, and they were enveloped by the feather's light.</p><p>In an instant, the Yao vanished, and the Immortal Restriction returned to normal.</p><p>They had slipped into the inner hall undetected.</p><p>"We're in?"</p><p>The armored warrior still found it hard to believe they had so easily infiltrated this sacred human ground.</p><p>He surveyed the surroundings, finding a vast expanse of desolation. There were no living creatures, nor any traces of human restrictions or spirit arrays.</p><p>King Flood Dragon's expression remained unchanged. After a moment of contemplation, he took out a finger-long white bone.</p><p>Holding the bone, golden light flickered in King Flood Dragon's palm.</p><p>The Yao exchanged glances, standing quietly as they watched King Flood Dragon's actions.</p><p>...</p><p>The Heavenly Tower.</p><p>Several ghostly figures appeared silently before the entrance to the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>They paused, revealing their true forms, and looked towards the entrance of the Seven Slaughter Palace.</p><p>The leader was the Grand Wu Priest.</p><p>To the Grand Wu Priest's left, an inconspicuous withered leaf cicada floated quietly in the air.</p><p>The others looked at the Grand Wu Priest and the withered leaf cicada with a hint of awe.</p><p>"The human cultivators have all gone inside. We should move as well," the Grand Wu Priest said softly, looking at the withered leaf cicada.</p><p>Old Demon Fang didn't say a word. He vanished into thin air, flying into the Heavenly Tower first.</p><p>The trials of the first few levels of the Heavenly Tower were nothing to them. With Old Demon Fang scouting ahead, the cultivators proceeded unimpeded, reaching the seventh level.</p><p>"The humans haven't left any traps here. It seems the inner hall holds treasures that are even more enticing to them," the Grand Wu Priest said indifferently.</p><p>Old Demon Fang sneered, "Unless Demon Lord and the others are personally guarding the place, how could they stop us?  They would only be humiliating themselves!"</p>
