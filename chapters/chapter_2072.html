<h1>Chapter 2063 Jiaojiao</h1><p>Several figures descended silently onto the plains above. It was Qin Sang and his companions.</p><p>They had flown non-stop, successfully leaving the dangerous sea region, but Si Lu suggested they stop.</p><p>“During the Great Mist, moving around conspicuously will arouse suspicion. It's best to find a place to hide until the Mist Year passes.  I'll try to secure suitable identities for everyone during this time, so we won't have to live in the shadows…”</p><p>During the Mist Year, unless tasked with patrols, even the cultivators of the Heterodox Races would generally remain within their caves, avoiding travel.</p><p>After discussing with Su Nu, Qin Sang agreed.  Traveling during the Mist Year was indeed fraught with peril.</p><p>Void Refinement Stage Mist Beasts were one concern.  Encountering a Mist Cascade in the borderlands between the various races, places already rife with danger, was another grave risk. Though the likelihood was small, it couldn't be ignored.</p><p>Furthermore, Si Lu, having dedicated himself solely to cultivation, was unfamiliar with worldly affairs and needed to gather information.</p><p>They scanned their surroundings. Due to the dense fog, only the faint outlines of undulating mountains at the edge of the plains were visible.  Several mounds rose from the center of the plains, clearly dwellings, likely a settlement of the Si You Clan.</p><p>Sensing everyone looking at him, Si Lu felt a pang of shame. He had never concerned himself with matters beyond cultivation and didn't know where they were.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu were already discreetly using their divine senses to perceive the spiritual energy of the surrounding plains.</p><p>“The spiritual energy here is weak. There shouldn't be any powerful cultivators,” Su Nu said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his gaze shifting towards a village. “There's one cultivator in the village, but their cultivation is low, only at the first level of the Nascent Soul Realm.”</p><p>There wasn't even a cultivator equivalent to the Foundation Establishment Stage in the entire plain.</p><p>“This place is remote.  The clan members living here are mostly exiles, with thin Origin Power. It's rare for powerful cultivators to emerge here.  If Mist Beasts don't appear frequently, the cultivators responsible for guarding this area wouldn't be stationed here permanently, only coming by for occasional patrols.”</p><p>Si Lu, after briefly sensing, also detected the individual, a child, and remarked in surprise, “This child must have just Awakened and hasn't been sent to the prefecture yet, delayed by the Mist Year. However, Awakening spontaneously without the refinement rituals performed by the prefecture masters is considered a sign of genius within our Si You Clan.  For this village to have one, this lineage must be experiencing a stroke of good fortune!”</p><p>The appearance of a genius within a family was a great boon, potentially allowing them to leave this desolate land and relocate to the prefecture.  Even if the child didn't achieve great things in the future, as long as their bloodline continued, their descendants would be more likely to Awaken, effectively changing the family's destiny.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, please wait a moment. I'll inquire about the location of the nearest city…”</p><p>Si Lu's figure flickered, landing near the village.  He gently rubbed his brow and employed a secret technique.  Wary of any powerful Si You Clan cultivators in the vicinity, they avoided using their divine senses to probe extensively, opting for this more cumbersome method of 'asking for directions.'</p><p>Moments later, the entire village fell into a deep slumber, the sound of snoring filling the air.</p><p>Si Lu quickly obtained his answer and returned.</p><p>Su Nu, who had noticed something interesting in the village, asked curiously, “Do your Si You Clan also take husbands…?”</p><p>She realized her phrasing was off and corrected herself, “Partners?”</p><p>The Si You Clan were hermaphroditic, meaning they didn't require sexual union between male and female.  They conceived through absorbing spiritual energy.</p><p>However, within the village, most families resembled the human dynamic of men farming and women weaving. One partner appeared yin, the other yang, forming partnerships with divided roles, indistinguishable from humans.</p><p>Could there be a difference between ordinary members and cultivators within the Si You Clan?</p><p>Si Lu explained without a hint of surprise, “Although our clan is hermaphroditic, it doesn't mean we can't take partners.  If two individuals have mutual affection, they can adjust their internal yin and yang.  The one with a stronger yang energy becomes like a human male, while the more yin individual becomes like a human female, enabling them to unite and conceive. Even ordinary people can do this. In fact, this is the most common practice among ordinary members.  Firstly, having a partner alleviates loneliness and provides mutual support. Secondly, conceiving alone puts a greater strain on one's vital energy.  However, choosing to remain solitary is also not uncommon…”</p><p>He gestured, indicating those who managed their households alone, also with children and grandchildren.</p><p>“So, doesn't this mean that couples can switch roles at will, experiencing life as a woman or a man as they please? What an intriguing custom.”</p><p>Su Nu chuckled.  “I wonder, which party receives the betrothal gifts?”</p><p>“Betrothal gifts?”</p><p>Si Lu looked bewildered.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't bear it any longer and interrupted Su Nu. “Fellow Daoist, did you find the location of the prefecture city?”</p><p>“Please follow me…”</p><p>Si Lu pointed the way, leading them as he flew.  “There’s a Zenith Tower in this city.  I’ll try to infiltrate the Zenith Tower and secure an identity.”</p><p>Si Lu explained that the Zenith Tower was an institution established by the Si You Clan royalty and the various regional lords for disseminating teachings.  They selected talented children within the prefectures to impart knowledge and cultivation methods.</p><p>Entering the Zenith Tower for cultivation was the dream of every Si You Clan member, and the child would undoubtedly be recruited.</p><p>Crossing mountains and rivers, a city appeared in the distance.  After a brief discussion, they split into two groups. Su Nu took Gu Ya and the others to find a hiding place, while Qin Sang and Si Lu entered the city together.</p><p>During the Mist Year, city defenses would naturally be strengthened, but since the Mist Beasts lacked intelligence and didn't employ strategy, the security at the city gates wasn't particularly tight.  With a little trickery, the two entered the city.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu separated. Qin Sang carefully investigated several hidden locations within the city, confirming the absence of Empty Realm Second Stage cultivators, before informing Si Lu and beginning to plan his entry into the Zenith Tower.</p><p>Within the Heterodox Races’ territory, Qin Sang couldn't offer much assistance.  He purchased a courtyard and waited for news.</p><p>With Si Lu's cultivation level, it was impossible for anyone in the city to detect his actions. He quickly found an opportunity and secured a plausible identity.  Over the next few months, through further maneuvering, Si Lu was able to move openly.</p><p>During this period, Si Lu delivered volumes of ancient texts to Qin Sang. Unfortunately, this place was too remote, lacking the texts that recorded secret knowledge.  They would have to wait for the Mist Year to pass and continue their search in other prefectures, or even the royal city, to determine their next course of action.</p><p>Fortunately, the Mist Year wouldn't last too long.  After about a year, the dense fog would begin to dissipate.</p><p>One day, while Qin Sang was meditating in his room, he sensed the restrictions being triggered, knowing it was Si Lu. He waved his hand, opening the courtyard gate.</p><p>Si Lu, now using the alias Qi Zan, brought good news. “The Mist Sundial shows the omen.  In ten days, the Mist Tide will recede!”</p><p>The Mist Sundial was a treasure crafted by the Si You Clan royalty, used for conveying information throughout the realm.  The ten-day prediction of the mist's retreat should be the result of calculations by powerful members of the royal family and was generally accurate.</p><p>“Has Fellow Daoist made all the necessary arrangements?” Qin Sang asked, raising his eyes.</p><p>Si Lu replied confidently, “From now on, I'll be known as Qi Zan, a master traveling with his disciples.  I believe even if the royal family sends someone to investigate, they won't find any flaws!”</p><p>He flicked his sleeve, sending forth clusters of azure light, which coalesced into several sets of spirit armor. “I must ask you, Fellow Daoists, to pose as my retinue.”</p><p>Among the Si You Clan, individuals of high status were entitled to a retinue.  By wearing the spirit armor, Qin Sang and the others could conceal their appearances openly without arousing suspicion.</p><p>The two left the city and rejoined Su Nu and the others. They waited in the mountains for ten days. Suddenly, a ray of sunlight pierced the dense fog and shone down.</p><p>In an instant, their vision cleared considerably.  Looking up, they saw a point of light appear in the sky.</p><p>It was midday.</p><p>The thought barely registered before, within a single breath, the surrounding mountain peaks became clearly visible.</p><p>After a few more breaths, only a thin mist remained, drifting in the void.  Then, even this mist, resembling morning fog, dispersed.</p><p>In a short time, the all-encompassing dense fog vanished entirely.  The sky was vast and clear, the sun shining brightly.</p><p>The radiant sun brought warmth, dispelling the chill.</p><p>Life began to revive.</p><p>In the distance, they saw the Si You Clan members pouring into the city streets, dancing and cheering.</p><p>They were secretly astonished.  They had been closely observing their surroundings but hadn't seen the Mist Tide recede.  The fog seemed to appear and disappear without a trace, its origin and destination unknown.</p><p>The Mist Sea held many mysteries.  Si Lu, long accustomed to such oddities, beckoned them to depart.</p><p>In the following days, their figures appeared in various locations throughout the Si You Clan's territory, finally infiltrating a royal city.  Their purpose wasn't to meet the regional lord but to confirm certain information to finalize their itinerary.</p><p>Once again, Qin Sang and Si Lu entered the city together, Qin Sang disguised as a guard in spirit armor.</p><p>After some time in the city, Qin Sang and Si Lu met in a private room of a restaurant. Si Lu spread out a sea chart marking the territories of the various vassal races, surrounded by dense fog.</p><p>He drew a crooked line with his finger. “We depart from here and can travel through this area to enter the Han Huang Kingdom. It’s said there's a passage within this section of the Mist Tide, allowing travel between the two regions. My clan has always stationed guards around this part of the Mist Tide, so the rumors seem to be true. The Han Huang Kingdom isn’t on good terms with my clan, and because of this, they wouldn’t allow my adversaries to enter their territory to hunt us down.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze fell upon that area of the Mist Tide.  During this time, they had confirmed the rumors were likely true, but they hadn’t discovered the exact route.  They would need to explore that themselves.</p><p>However, now that they had a clear direction, it shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, about to speak, when he noticed Si Lu staring out the window with a peculiar expression.</p><p>“Did you see someone you know?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Si Lu nodded, surprise evident on his face.  “I didn't expect to see him here…”</p><p>Qin Sang also looked out the window.  The streets were bustling with people. Being in the royal city, there were also cultivators present.  At that moment, two Si You Clan members at the fourth level of the Nascent Soul Realm walked past the window.</p><p>However, Si Lu was watching an ordinary person.</p><p>Perched on the ordinary person’s shoulder was a tiny figure. The small figure had limbs and features like a human, but was incredibly small, only the size of a thumb.  He swung his little legs, observing the street scenes with a look of fascination.</p><p>Despite his small size, the tiny figure’s cultivation wasn't weak, comparable to the late Deity Transformation Stage.  He had evidently employed some secret technique to conceal himself, as the surrounding people seemed oblivious to his presence, and the ordinary person he was using as a mount was also unaware.</p><p>“Which clan does he belong to?”</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that the Si You Clan’s vassal races didn't include such beings.</p><p>“He's not one of my clan’s vassal races. His clan is called the Jiaojiao.  They are small in stature but hold a high position, also one of the Celestial Tribes, like us.”</p><p>Si Lu shook his head. “His name is Ji Hong.  I met him by chance over a hundred years ago and even saved his life once. He claimed to be traveling through this area when he encountered danger.  If I hadn't happened to be passing by and asked Xia Changshi to help, he would have been either killed or severely injured. After recovering, he left our territory through a teleportation formation.  I don’t know when he returned.”</p><p>“You’re indebted to him?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately grasped the key point and his mind raced.  “How many people know about this?  Fellow Daoist, do you think this person is trustworthy?”</p><p>Si Lu had saved Ji Hong’s life, and Ji Hong’s clan was on equal footing with the Si You Clan, so there was no need to worry about him submitting to Si Lu’s adversaries.</p><p>Most importantly, this person traveled extensively, and they might be able to glean useful information from him.</p><p>Si Lu recalled, “At the time, only Xia Changshi and I were present. Not many know about this. He has a straightforward nature and was very grateful after I rescued him.  It didn’t seem like an act.”</p><p>“In that case, let’s invite him over,” Qin Sang suggested.</p><p>Even if something unexpected occurred, Ji Hong was only at the Deity Transformation Stage and would be easy to control.</p><p>Si Lu hesitated.  After witnessing the betrayals of those he once held dear, he didn't want to experience that pain again.</p><p>If Ji Hong had also been bought by his adversaries, he would lose another friend!</p><p>Si Lu sighed softly and took out a jade pendant.  “Would Fellow Daoist be so kind as to make the trip?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and vanished in a flash.</p><p>On the street, Ji Hong directed the ordinary person onto a quieter street.  He swung his little legs, jumped from the person’s shoulder, turned to look behind him, and pouted.  “Fellow Daoist, you've been following me for quite a while. What is the matter? Do you think I'm small and weak, easy to bully? Don't forget the agreement between the Celestial Tribes!”</p><p>The void rippled slightly as the fully armored Qin Sang materialized.  He cupped his fists in greeting.  “Might I inquire if you are Fellow Daoist Ji Hong?”</p><p>Ji Hong’s eyes flickered, his tone becoming somewhat urgent.  “How do you know my name?”</p><p>He scrutinized Qin Sang from head to toe and pressed further, “Who is your lord?”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his palm, revealing the jade pendant for a fleeting moment. “My lord awaits you, Fellow Daoist. If you wish to see him, please follow me.”</p><p>“Quickly! Fellow Daoist, quickly take me there!”</p><p>Ji Hong jumped onto Qin Sang’s shoulder, urging him repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Ji Hong from the corner of his eye. This little fellow was certainly uninhibited.  He quickly restrained his protective true essence to avoid flinging Ji Hong off.</p><p>He deliberately took a circuitous route, observing that Ji Hong showed no unusual behavior, and brought him to Si Lu.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Si Lu! It truly is you!”</p><p>Ji Hong, as expected, was genuinely delighted to see Si Lu.  “You’re alive! That’s wonderful! When I heard about the unrest within the Si You Clan, I rushed over immediately.  I’ve been searching for so long, nearly covering the entire Si You Clan territory, but I couldn't find any trace of you. I thought you…”</p><p>He jumped onto the table, spinning in excitement.  “This is wonderful! This is wonderful!”</p><p>Seeing Ji Hong’s elation, an inexplicable emotion stirred within Si Lu. “I caused you concern, Fellow Daoist.”</p>
