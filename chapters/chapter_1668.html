<h1>Chapter 1659: adrift in the star sea</h1><p>The Seven Mansions Sword Formation actually has two Bi mansions, one bright and one dark; the bright one is false, the dark one is real.  Kun Dao entered the true Bi mansion.</p><p>This is the heart of the Seven Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>If there is a master of the formation, they would be stationed in the Bi mansion, and all the sword cultivators in the formation would obey this person.</p><p>The star pavilion is located here, as hidden as the cave in the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition.</p><p>Kun Dao appeared before the star pavilion.</p><p>The star pavilion is not grand; it only has two floors, its body long and sword-like. The upper floor has no walls, allowing a direct view inside.</p><p>Four swords hang at each corner of the upper floor.</p><p>The sword bodies are transparent, seemingly composed of starlight, but their essence is similar to those sword stars, containing pure and refined sword intent.</p><p>Four streams of sword intent descend, sealing the star pavilion.</p><p>Kun Dao stood still, her gaze sweeping over the stars of the Bi mansion.</p><p>At this moment, if Qin Sang and the others had a way to enter the Bi mansion, they would surely be greatly surprised, for most of the stars in the Bi mansion have shifted, their starlight flickering.  Seeing these stars, they wouldn't need to travel the star sea extensively; with some effort, they could likely deduce the method to break the formation.</p><p>This phenomenon is because the Bi mansion, as the heart of the sword formation, directly faced the impact.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao destroyed the Jade Pavilion, and the Bi mansion bore the brunt of the attack. The internal energy clashed and collided, subsequently affecting the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, and then reverberating back, exacerbating the situation.</p><p>The center is in chaos, causing the Seven Mansions to tremble. If it's not adjusted in time, the sword formation will gradually collapse, potentially causing the Five Elements Divine Prohibition to crumble.</p><p>Starlight illuminated the upper half of Kun Dao's face; the lower half was hidden in shadow, revealing no emotion.</p><p>Sharp sword intent surrounded the star pavilion, but Kun Dao ignored it, taking two steps forward, raising her right hand, passing through the sword intent, and easily pushing open the pavilion's door.</p><p>Similar to the cave in the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition, the furnishings of the star pavilion are extremely simple.</p><p>Inside the pavilion is a sword stand.</p><p>The hanging swords on the upper floor send their sword intent straight into the pavilion, forming four white pillars of light at the corners of the sword stand.</p><p>A female cultivator sits cross-legged on the sword stand.</p><p>The female cultivator's clothing is simple, devoid of ornaments. A treasured sword, engraved with seven stars, lies flat on her knees; under the light pillars, it shines brilliantly, as if inlaid with seven jewels.</p><p>Surrounded by sword intent, the female cultivator sits upright, her spine unbent, straight as a soaring sharp sword!</p><p>However, the female cultivator's expression is distorted, with clear pain. Even after a long time, one can still see firm determination in her eyes, her posture rigid, as if resisting something.</p><p>Whether she defeated her opponent is unknown, but the result was her demise here.</p><p>Only the female cultivator is in the pavilion.</p><p>Kun Dao walked to the sword stand, raised her hand and made a grasping motion twice; the female cultivator's facial features actually changed, the pain on her expression fading, replaced by calmness.</p><p>Unlike the cave in the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition, which was scorched by celestial fire, the ever-present sword intent here has merged with the female cultivator's remains, instead acting as a support, preserving them.</p><p>In fact, while the female cultivator appears to have a body and vivid expression, her life essence has long since vanished.</p><p>Moreover, Kun Dao senses a unique sword intent from the female cultivator's remains that connects with the star pavilion's hanging swords, as if the female cultivator had refined herself into a sword. Her extraordinary achievements in the sword path undoubtedly contributed to this.</p><p>Kun Dao doesn't intend to disturb the female cultivator's remains; she merely subtly adjusts her expression to make it more pleasing, then directly reaches into the sword stand and retrieves the female cultivator's spatial storage items.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The treasures spill onto the floor.</p><p>Kun Dao habitually picks out and eats anything edible, but unlike in the cave of the Yang Yan Divine Prohibition, she picks up other items one by one, her eyes thoughtful, assessing the treasures' value to cultivators.</p><p>Before long, Kun Dao leaves the star pavilion and leaps to the edge of the Seven Mansions Sword Formation, the border with the Earth Element Divine Prohibition.</p><p>The sword formation is dim, sword stars hanging in the air.</p><p>The Earth Element Divine Prohibition is even darker than the sword formation, filled with heavy fog that drifts through the space.  The fog breathes like burning flames, displaying alternating gray-black and ochre colors, lacking any lightness, giving a very heavy feeling.</p><p>The sword formation and the dark fog, two distinctly different forces, meet here without conflict. Under the control of the Five Elements Restrictions, the energy flows smoothly according to the Five Elements' generative cycle.</p><p>Although the Seven Mansions Sword Formation shows anomalies, the other Divine Prohibitions are also affected, but it takes time, and the effects are not yet apparent.</p><p>Kun Dao glanced twice, raised her hand, grasped a wisp of fog, and a familiar feeling returned. Without the constraint of sword intent, she can control the Earth Element Divine Prohibition to a certain extent.</p><p>She was about to enter the mystical fog, searching for treasures within the Earth God's prohibition, hoping to strengthen her position, when she sensed something and frowned.</p><p>Things were always slipping from her control.</p><p>Her progress was faster than expected, and Kun Dao felt the pressure of time.</p><p>Within the sword formation:</p><p>The Poison King and Su Zinan's groups merged.  Having little animosity towards each other, after a brief exchange, they decided to share information, combining their observations of the displaced stars.</p><p>This significantly increased their progress.</p><p>Moreover, the four great cultivators, working together, broke through the formation at an unprecedented speed, far surpassing Qin Sang.</p><p>At this point, Kun Dao could only quickly return to Star Pavilion to make preparations.</p><p>She already had a plan for the next step.</p><p>Standing above Star Pavilion, Kun Dao surveyed her surroundings, locking onto a distant void—a hidden star, the core of the entire formation.</p><p>She could move freely within the sword formation, possessing an extremely refined perception of its energy, able to grasp its essence. Anyone with her level of perception, even without swordsmanship skills, could find the formation's core and manipulate it.</p><p>This was precisely Kun Dao's ability.</p><p>She flickered, merging with the hidden star.</p><p>Instantly, the hidden star blazed, but then quickly faded.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a strange fluctuation emanated from the hidden star, affecting the surrounding stars, their light flickering. When this influence reached Star Pavilion, it amplified dramatically.</p><p>Star Pavilion shone brightly, affecting the three nearby sword stars.</p><p>Four stars shone brilliantly, instantly as bright as the moon.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, the Poison King, and others at other constellations felt it, looking towards the horizon.  A faint starlight shimmered at the edge of the star sea.</p><p>Compared to the vast star trails, this starlight was insignificant, yet it was what they had been desperately searching for.</p><p>"Bishu!"</p><p>Everyone calculated and consulted the star chart, overjoyed.</p><p>During their imprisonment within the sword formation, they had deduced that the Bishu visible to the naked eye was fake; the real Bishu was hidden, the core of the sword formation!</p><p>Breaking the formation meant finding the core, where the fluctuations of the formation were most intense, the source of the stellar displacement.</p><p>Controlling the core would reveal the way out!</p><p>The sword formation was in motion, the constellations constantly shifting. They could only locate Bishu by searching for the displaced stars, analyzing the formation step by step.</p><p>Bishu remained hidden deep within the sword formation.</p><p>Now, Bishu's sudden appearance as a bright star was like a guiding light.</p><p>If the bright star had appeared earlier, they wouldn't have gone through so much trouble; they could have simply followed the light.</p><p>The appearance of the bright star didn't surprise them.</p><p>It was unexpected yet logical.</p><p>They had deduced that as the sword formation gradually crumbled, Bishu's appearance was inevitable, signifying that the internal energy conflict within the formation had reached a critical point.</p><p>With enough patience, remaining still, if the sword formation couldn't adjust in time, it would collapse without attack.  But they couldn't wait that long.</p><p>However, the appearance of Bishu rendered all their previous efforts in deduction useless, which was frustrating.</p><p>In the boundless cosmos, the bright star seemed dim.</p><p>As soon as it appeared, it was engulfed by the dazzling star trails, lost in the Milky Way, invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>Seeing the bright star, everyone was determined to keep it in sight. Including Qin Sang, they all used their abilities to lock onto the bright star and flew into the Milky Way.</p><p>Their minds freed from complex calculations, they noticed the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos!</p><p>Even with their high cultivation, they could only gaze up at the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars beyond reach.</p><p>Now, the bright star drifted through the Milky Way.</p><p>Chasing the bright star, they soared through the Milky Way, able to touch the stars, an unprecedented experience.</p><p>Even if the stars were illusory.</p><p>Su Zinan and the other three also stopped their discussions and enjoyed the scenery.</p><p>Of course, they hadn't forgotten their mission.</p><p>Qin Sang firmly locked onto the bright star, speeding relentlessly, noticing that the bright star was also moving rapidly, without any discernible pattern, making it impossible to predict its movements. They could only increase their speed, as did Su Zinan and the others.</p><p>They understood this was normal.  If Bishu were easily accessible, the sword formation would be a joke.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected this wasn't the full extent of the formation's changes.</p><p>If the sword stars weren't formed of rigid sword intent, but by individual sword cultivators, not only would their power increase significantly, but the formation's core might shift constantly among the Western Seven Mansions.</p><p>The formation's evolution was truly boundless.</p><p>As his thoughts wandered, Qin Sang drew closer to the bright star. He hadn't forgotten the mysterious enemy lurking in the shadows, but the Fire Jade Centipede was drowsy, and the person seemed to have truly given up.</p><p>Within the sword formation, Qin Sang didn't know how far he had traveled.</p><p>Finally, the bright star grew closer.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable sensation.</p><p>The stars remained, their number unchanged, yet Qin Sang knew he had entered a new realm—the true Bi Constellation, the heart of the sword array!</p><p>“Finally…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression relaxed slightly, his gaze still fixed on the bright stars.  Upon entering the Bi Constellation, the scene transformed dramatically. The previously dim stars blazed with intense light.</p><p>After a moment's observation, Qin Sang realized there were four stars, shining together—no wonder they were so striking. This must be where the clash of energies was most violent.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang swiftly approached the stars.</p><p>But before he could get close, an unexpected sight appeared.  A vast, thick fog surged forth from behind the bright stars, like a nebula in the cosmos.  Its scale was immense, stretching across the backdrop of the stars, sharply defined, extending endlessly to either side.</p><p>“What nebula? No!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s initial confusion turned to understanding. That wasn't a nebula; it was the edge of the sword array. But the opposite side wasn't an exit, but another Five Elements Divine Restriction.  Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water. Judging by its aura—dense rather than light—it was most likely an Earth Element Divine Restriction.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Restrictions' energies were interconnected, forming a seamless whole. Within the sword array, stars flowed ceaselessly, the positions of the seven constellations constantly shifting. The Bi Constellation's movement could easily have brought them to the edge of the Earth Element Divine Restriction.</p><p>Having depleted their energy in the sword array for so long, Qin Sang couldn't enter the Earth Element Divine Restriction; it would mean starting over.</p><p>He shifted his gaze back to the bright stars.  But this time, what he saw astonished him.</p><p>The Earth Element Divine Restriction and the Seven Constellations' Sword Array were connected. Sword stars constantly drifted from the edge of the Earth Element Divine Restriction—a common occurrence during the normal operation of the Five Elements Divine Restriction.  Thus, even when close, the sword stars didn't collide with the restriction, preventing a violent reaction.  This had continued uninterrupted for countless years.</p><p>However, Zhu Wu Dao's destruction of the Jade Pavilion had disrupted the harmonious balance by causing energy clashes within the sword array. Other constellations’ sword stars showed minimal deviation, avoiding the Earth Element Divine Restriction.</p><p>But now it was different. The core of the sword array, the true Bi Constellation, was drifting closer.  As the starting point of the sword array's chaos, the Bi Constellation's sword stars were significantly displaced, particularly the four bright stars, nearing the point of leaving their original paths.</p><p>Such a near miss with the Earth Element Divine Restriction was bound to cause an incident. The Divine Restriction was massive, but while this incident wouldn't directly cause its collapse, repeated impacts would be detrimental, and lethal to the sword stars themselves!</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze returned to the four bright stars. He watched as they arced across the void, drifting toward the Earth Element Divine Restriction. As they neared the 'nebula', the arc began to close.  But their deviation meant they wouldn't follow their predetermined path.  To Qin Sang’s surprise, they collided with the 'nebula'!</p><p>Simultaneously, at another location within the Bi Constellation, Su Zi Nan and the others, even closer than Qin Sang, witnessed the scene with astonishment.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The halo formed by the four bright stars struck the 'nebula'.  The impact tore a hole in the 'nebula', but the dense fog churned, and an endless torrent of mist surged back.</p><p>Of the four stars traveling together, the closest one made contact first, nearly half of it disappearing into the 'nebula'. With a bit of luck, and a less severe deviation, there was a chance of it returning.</p><p>But then, something astonishing happened. The star, upon contacting the nebula, violently shuddered, then completely broke from its orbit, plunging into the depths of the nebula—a rapid, unforeseen change.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred.</p><p>“Nine-Source Earth Magnetism!”</p><p>The Poison King gravely revealed the 'nebula's' true nature. The interwoven grey, black, and yellow mist was formed from Nine-Source Earth Magnetism. The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had channeled the magnetism from the earth's depths to create this Earth Element Divine Restriction!</p><p>The bright stars colliding with the earth magnetism were pulled into the 'nebula'.  This was only the beginning of the chaos. The disturbed magnetism then pulled in the remaining three bright stars.</p><p>The first bright star, unable to withstand the magnetism's pull, exploded. The shockwave swept outwards, instantly detonating the nearest star, while the other two were flung clear by the blast.</p><p>At that moment…</p><p>Qin Sang, straining his eyes, finally saw that the second bright star wasn't a normal sword star, but a sword-shaped stellar pavilion.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The stellar pavilion exploded.</p>
