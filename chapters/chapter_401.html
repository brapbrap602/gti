Chapter 394: Blood Sacrifice to Ghosts


The Five Elements Breaking Formation Sword spell is specifically designed to break through restrictions.


Gu Tiannan, being only at the Qi Refinement stage, had limited access to spiritual materials; thus, the quality of the Five Elements Spirit Swords he refined to complement the spell was not high, and Qin Sang rarely used them later.


Qin Sang had mastered the spell completely. Later, he collected more materials and commissioned someone to re-refine the Five Elements Spirit Swords, significantly improving their quality.


He had found the key to breaking the restriction.


The spirit swords advanced simultaneously, transforming into long rainbows that pierced the barrier.


The barrier glowed with waves of spiritual light, rippling like water, illuminating the entire side chamber in a kaleidoscope of colors.


Qin Sang put Yu Hua out of his mind, focusing intently on the restriction, not daring to miss a single change.  He had to manipulate the Five Elements Breaking Formation Sword with utmost precision, borrowing the power of the five elements to break through the intricate and complex restrictions to succeed.


Even so, it took Qin Sang a full thirty breaths to open the barrier.


Fortunately, Yu Hua hadn't yet managed to subdue the Flying Night Rakshasa.


Breaking the restriction, while seemingly lacking in intense combat, was as mentally draining as the previous battle. One mistake could trigger a counterattack from the restriction, rendering all previous efforts futile.


Qin Sang, exhausted in body and mind, wiped the sweat from his forehead. His face was unnaturally pale as he glanced back.


The battle outside was incredibly fierce. It wasn't easy for Yu Hua to focus on breaking the restriction while entangled with the Flying Night Rakshasa. This restriction should buy him some more time.


Mulling this over, Qin Sang took a step forward, gazing into the pitch-black darkness ahead.


The path ahead was uncertain, and he didn't know what he would face.


Yun Youzi had been cryptic about it, saying the path ahead was extremely dangerous, even beyond his own capabilities.  He'd advised Qin Sang to leave to avoid getting entangled.


But with several of his treasures—the Silver Knife Talisman, Black Dragon Stone, Soul Binding Rope, and the living corpse—destroyed, and himself near exhaustion, Qin Sang was facing a near-death situation and couldn't heed Yun Youzi's warning anymore.


Even a life-threatening situation was better than his current predicament.


Chaos offered a chance for survival amidst the impossible!


With these thoughts, Qin Sang's expression hardened. He summoned his Ebony Sword for defense and stepped into the darkness.


The next moment, the world spun.


This feeling was very familiar.


Qin Sang's heart stirred. Hidden in the darkness was a teleportation array.  His vision returned, revealing another empty ice hall.


Unlike the outside ice hall, this one showed clear signs of artificial excavation.


The square ice hall had clearly been carved out with a sword.


Behind him was darkness, and on the opposite ice wall, strange lights flowed. Qin Sang immediately recognized these as powerful ice wall enchantments, seemingly primarily defensive.


Quickly assessing his surroundings, Qin Sang was surprised by the unusual quiet, devoid of any expected danger.  He then dashed to the ice wall.


The ice wall was somewhat transparent, allowing him to vaguely see the outside.


Outside, a hurricane whipped up endless snow, constantly battering the ice wall.  The view was a blinding white.


Other than that, there were no apparent dangers, no visible ancient beasts.


Qin Sang's mind raced.  Instead of trying to break the ice wall's enchantment, he sat cross-legged against it, summoning the Ten Directions Yama Banner and retrieving an item from his pouch.


It was the Ten Directions Yama Banner treasure he'd obtained from Sun De!


Not only Yu Hua possessed treasures, but he did too!


Qin Sang stared at the massive banner, probing it with his spiritual sense.  As expected, the treasure remained unresponsive.


"Looks like I need to set up an array first,"


Qin Sang muttered to himself, checking his internal state. His injuries had healed somewhat. He then waved his hand, activating the Ten Directions Yama Array in front of him.


"Come out!"


Qin Sang shouted, his Yin Qi surging as ten main souls emerged from the ghost banner.


Even then, Qin Sang couldn't feel a connection between the main souls and the treasure.


Blood sacrifice…


Recalling every detail he'd witnessed in the dark pool, Qin Sang knew that the Demon Sect had many similar blood refinement techniques.  He just didn't know if blood sacrifice alone was enough or if a secret technique was required.


If a secret technique was needed, he could only abandon his attempt to use the treasure, break the restriction, and flee.


Success or failure hinged on this single act!


He used his spiritual energy to form a small knife, cutting his fingertip.


Qin Sang squeezed out a few drops of blood, dividing them into ten, each flying towards a main soul.


Sensing the essence of Qin Sang's blood, the main soul, like a hungry chick, eagerly opened its mouth and swallowed the blood.

One could clearly see Qin Sang's blood flowing into the main soul, its surface glowing faintly with blood light.

Qin Sang tried to activate the artifact, but it remained unresponsive.

Not enough!

Qin Sang pondered.

In the dark pool, the main souls under Yu Hua were almost entirely covered in blood vessels, their blood light several times stronger, barely able to support the artifact.

Qin Sang gritted his teeth, ignoring his weakness, and forced out most of his blood to feed the main souls.

"Roar! Roar!"

The main souls roared excitedly, blood vessels spreading across their bodies, the blood light intensifying.

Qin Sang's already abnormally pale skin became translucent, yet his face showed an expression of extreme surprise.

At that moment, he finally felt a response from the artifact!

This method works!

Qin Sang rejoiced, glanced at the artifact, threw it forcefully, and then forcibly constrained the excited main souls to unite, jointly lifting the artifact.

'Boom!'

An incredibly powerful aura surged from the artifact, causing one to tremble involuntarily!

Ten main souls struggled to lift the artifact, letting out strained roars, but they successfully withstood the pressure and persevered.

Qin Sang popped a handful of spirit pills into his mouth, quickly focusing his mind on the artifact.

To his surprise, the artifact did not contain the billions of souls he had imagined; instead, it was filled with endless Netherworld Demon Flames, obscuring the heavens and the earth, with nothing else visible.

Perhaps his cultivation was too low to perceive the artifact's full extent.

This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but time was pressing, so he didn't investigate further; being able to control the Netherworld Demon Flames was enough!

With his mind connected to the artifact, Qin Sang moved a thought, and a vortex immediately appeared on the banner, and the Netherworld Demon Flames poured out of the vortex, coalescing into a stream and swirling around Qin Sang.

The power of the Netherworld Demon Flames was terrifying. Qin Sang had no doubt that without the artifact's constraint, he would be easily reduced to ashes.

However, the Netherworld Demon Flames were surprisingly obedient, completely under Qin Sang's control.

At the same time, Qin Sang understood the artifact's terrifying consumption; it was like a bottomless pit, constantly draining his spiritual energy. Fortunately, his injuries had partially healed, and he had taken several spirit pills beforehand, allowing him to barely maintain himself.

However, this was not necessarily a bad thing.

It meant that Yu Hua also could not use the artifact for a long time!
