<h1>Chapter 1877: Late Nascent Soul Stage</h1><p>“Thank you, Master Yuan.”</p><p>Qin Sang had just learned that the old Daoist’s name was Yuan Yanchu.</p><p>The contents of these jade slips were all inherited from the Chongxuan Sect, the most important being a treatise called the *Chongxuan Codex*.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed himself in the *Chongxuan Codex*, his consciousness exploring its depths.  He occasionally heard Master Yuan’s voice, as the master was explaining the Dao to him.</p><p>The *Chongxuan Codex* wasn’t written in normal characters; instead, it consisted of extremely complex diagrams of talismans.</p><p>The talismans contained a vast array of symbols. A cultivator with even slightly deficient talismanic skills might not even be able to recognize all the symbols.</p><p>Qin Sang, in preparation for his cultivation, had studied talismanic knowledge extensively. Yet, he still found many parts unclear. Only with Master Yuan’s guidance did he achieve a thorough understanding.</p><p>After studying the entire *Chongxuan Codex*, Qin Sang understood why Master Yuan had chosen this particular inheritance for him.</p><p>Daoist schools highly value talismans, and their approach to refining artifacts is inseparable from, and indeed based upon, talismanic arts.</p><p>Qin Sang had once observed Master Gu refining artifacts.  The most crucial step in her process involved the application of talismans.  Before even beginning the process, she prepared various spirit talismans, spending even more time on preparation than on the refining itself.</p><p>The various incantations and talismans were dazzling, their timing and combinations carefully considered.</p><p>The *Chongxuan Codex*, however, was different. It focused more on the materials themselves, emphasizing the stacking of high-grade spiritual materials and blending their properties to achieve extraordinary power. To Qin Sang, this seemed somewhat crude.</p><p>Naturally, the *Chongxuan Codex* also included corresponding incantations, but they weren’t as complex as those found in orthodox Daoist refining techniques. Qin Sang wouldn't find them too difficult to learn.</p><p>This inheritance required the refiner to possess precise control over the characteristics of the materials. Otherwise, the stacking would be ineffective and might even lead to conflict. Qin Sang possessed considerable talent in this area; Master Gu herself had praised his keen spiritual perception.</p><p>Qin Sang was most interested in the spirit-nurturing techniques used in refining spiritual treasures. The *Chongxuan Codex* also contained one, a blood sacrifice technique.</p><p>Blood sacrifice refining might appear like a heretical technique, but it is actually a legitimate form of artifact refining.</p><p>However, the *Chongxuan Codex*'s approach is far more unrestrained.</p><p>Feeding the nascent spirit with blood sacrifices would greatly deplete one's own vital essence.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the Chongxuan disciples practiced some rigorous cultivation technique; otherwise, they would likely become withered and emaciated after just a few attempts.</p><p>Compared to Master Gu, the Chongxuan Sect gave Qin Sang the impression of a group of burly men, their robes tied around their waists, bare-chested, revealing their muscular bodies, wielding huge hammers and forging iron relentlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang had to admit that Master Yuan's judgment was sharp, and this inheritance was indeed perfectly suited to him.</p><p>This is it!</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slips and thanked him again. “I wonder if the Chongxuan Sect still has any living disciples in this era?”</p><p>Master Yuan stroked his beard and replied, “The Chongxuan Sect’s lineage has been severed. From now on, you are the sole inheritor of the Chongxuan Sect. But you don’t have to confine yourself to it. If you wish, you can take on a few disciples, carrying on the lineage; consider it your karmic connection with the Chongxuan Sect.”</p><p>His tone was calm and even as he spoke these words.</p><p>Since the decline of Daoism, even the Daoist court had fallen into decay. Countless Daoist sects had lost their lineages; many lost even their scriptures, leaving behind only a cold record in history books.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt the weight of the jade slips in his hands.</p><p>“Master Gu told me that she had possessed this war drum for many years, and later recorded her insights into it, which she gave to you. Over these years, have you gained any understanding, and when do you plan to begin refining it?” Master Yuan asked.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the implication and answered without hesitation, “Junior’s cultivation is still shallow.  Seeing the *Chongxuan Codex*, I realize my own shortcomings even more, and I want to make further progress before I start. I won't be able to focus on it for a while, so it would be inconvenient for me to keep the war drum. Please keep it for me, Master Yuan.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s understanding, Master Yuan smiled and nodded slightly. “Rest assured. Master Xun’s word is inviolable; the restoration of the war drum will wait until you personally take action. For now, the situation seems likely to drag on, and I need some time to study as well. You need not rush…”</p><p>After a moment’s thought, Master Yuan added, “I need to rearrange the grand formation and refine the earth’s fire every seven years. You can come during that time. Now, let me explain the essence of the *Chongxuan Codex* to you!”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately straightened his robes and sat upright in front of Master Yuan.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang left the altar. After staying at Master Gu's residence for a few days, he set off on his return journey.</p><p>Sword Heart Isle.</p><p>Returning to his cave dwelling, Qin Sang immediately entered a meditative state, replaying the sword light of the Sword Heart Master in his mind.</p><p>How brilliant and profound that sword strike was!</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at it, feeling that merely observing the strike had stirred his own swordsmanship, hinting at a breakthrough.</p><p>However, he couldn't completely immerse himself in the way of the sword; soon, he returned to his usual practice.</p><p>In the following period, Qin Sang devoted his main energy to cultivating the *Chapter on Nurturing Swords with the Primordial Spirit*, but he didn't stay in seclusion all the time.</p><p>He occasionally went out, partly to borrow the Master Qi's furnace to cultivate with the "Chongxuan Codex," and partly to exchange the pills he obtained from the Spirit Ghost King for his own cultivation needs.</p><p>Of these pills, Qin Sang kept those he could use, mostly body-tempering elixirs.  The remainder were only useful to demon cultivators. Although Qin Sang had demon marquises under him, he naturally prioritized his own advancement.</p><p>In the Daoist sect, those who cultivated in the military arts were either court officials or direct disciples of major sects, all of them wealthy and with no shortage of buyers for their pills.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, another twenty-five years passed on Jianxin Island.</p><p>One day,</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Jiannu not to disturb him, sealing the cave's restrictions.</p><p>More than ten days passed.</p><p>Jiannu sat on a rock atop the mountain. He sensed something unusual about Qin Sang's instructions and remained on guard.</p><p>Suddenly, the meditating Jiannu opened his eyes, his gaze sharp, and fixed on Qin Sang's cave.</p><p>A faint pressure emanated from the cave. The spiritual energy around the cave showed unusual phenomena, gradually spreading to the entire Jianxin Island, and even to the surrounding waters.</p><p>"Could it be…?"</p><p>Jiannu realized something, his face showing a mixture of surprise, joy, and envy. He immediately flew into the air.</p><p>The Sword Master was not on the island; only he and two demon marquises guarded Qin Sang.</p><p>Luo Hou and Gui Hou stood guard outside the cave, one on each side.</p><p>The situation was unstable, so Jiannu did not dare to be careless.  A radiant light flashed from his palm as he summoned a token, activating the island's protective formation.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Jianxin Island trembled slightly, and beams of light shot out from all sides of the island.</p><p>The four beams were not particularly large, only a hundred meters high. Then, using the beams as support, a hemispherical light shield appeared, enveloping the entire island.  Thunder crackled on the surface of the shield, poised to strike, giving off a sense of immense danger.</p><p>With the formation activated, Jiannu relaxed slightly.</p><p>The formation could not conceal the phenomenon. The spiritual energy above Jianxin Island was in turmoil, forming the beginnings of a storm. The sky became chaotic.</p><p>Dark clouds formed out of thin air and gathered overhead.  The phenomenon became increasingly violent, and Jiannu nervously scanned the surroundings.</p><p>The inner lake was now densely populated, and high-level cultivators could pass by at any time and be drawn to the phenomenon.</p><p>The celestial changes were rapid.</p><p>A radius of a hundred miles around Jianxin Island darkened, and a gale sprang up. Sure enough, cultivators were alarmed. Jiannu sensed approaching auras and gripped his token tightly.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The clouds churned, and the heavens roared.</p><p>Jiannu looked on in awe. He knew this was not a heavenly tribulation, but merely a natural phenomenon caused by a breakthrough, yet it seemed to possess the might of Heaven itself.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Above Qin Sang's cave, spiritual energy formed a visible tide, surging violently.</p><p>At that moment, two figures approached from afar, inquiring, "Daoist Jiannu, has your island encountered some danger?"</p><p>"Please halt!"</p><p>Jiannu shouted, his token flashing. A beam of light transformed into a sword, aimed at the newcomers, issuing a warning.</p><p>The newcomers stopped, exchanging glances. Through the celestial phenomenon, they had a hunch, and Jiannu's actions confirmed their suspicions.</p><p>"The Sword Master broke through to the mid-stage of the Cave Profound realm not even a century ago.  To break through again…Could he one day achieve the status of a Grand Master? It's a pity that the Sword Master is reclusive and dislikes socializing.  We've tried to visit several times but have never had the chance to meet him. It would have been good to make a connection."</p><p>"The one breaking through may not be him…"</p><p>Above Jianxin Island, a thunderclap rang out, interrupting their conversation.</p><p>The spiritual storm seemed to have found an outlet and poured madly towards Jianxin Island.</p><p>The two cultivators trembled slightly, their faces filled with shock. They murmured, "He succeeded?"</p><p>Before they finished speaking, an unparalleled aura erupted from Jianxin Island, but it quickly subsided.</p><p>The clouds dispersed.</p><p>The world gradually returned to normal.</p><p>"This… was it a success or a failure?"</p><p>The two were puzzled and dared not ask, fearing incurring displeasure.</p><p>Inside the cave,</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, sensing the surging true energy within him, a smile on his face.</p><p>He had finally reached the late stage of the Divine Transformation realm!</p><p>He wasn't overly surprised, as it was expected.</p><p>Qin Sang was confident in this breakthrough, so he didn't choose a special location and broke through directly on Jianxin Island.</p><p>The battles with Dingxiang Hou, the killing intent gained from slaying the Spirit Ghost King, the pills exchanged for the Spirit Ghost King's relics, plus the "Poison God Codex" and poisonous fruit juices – all these favorable conditions led to such astonishing achievements in a short time.</p><p>If he hadn't spent some energy cultivating the "Chongxuan Codex," it would have been even faster!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways, seeing the jade bottle floating beside him. He picked it up and shook it gently.</p><p>A thin layer of poisonous fruit extract remained in the jade bottle.  Qin Sang was running low; he needed Hua Ling to produce more floral essence soon.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Lightning illuminated the cave, revealing the altar!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the altar, sensing the Azure Luan True Lightning within. The power of the Thunder Turtle demon pill had been exhausted; he would need to use Azure Luan True Lightning to forge the altar from now on.</p><p>After several attempts, Qin Sang had become proficient, and the process would no longer hinder his cultivation.</p><p>The Azure Luan True Lightning within the phoenix wings was more than enough to support him to the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage.  How long it would last beyond that, however, was beyond his estimation.</p><p>Sensing the guardian deity stationed at the altar, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>He had a persistent worry: his altar guardian was his own inner essence, not a god of thunder.</p><p>For now, he could attribute it to unwavering willpower. But if he couldn’t explain its origin or provide a plausible reason when attempting the Void Refinement stage, it would inevitably arouse suspicion.</p><p>“I only hope the Illusory Storm will offer a chance, or that the Jade Buddha will continue to protect me…”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t think of a solution, so he decided to take things one step at a time.  He wouldn’t change his method unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Although the amount of integrated Azure Luan True Lightning wasn't yet sufficient, Qin Sang already felt the changes it brought.  The future might hold a pleasant surprise!</p><p>What power would the Divine Thunder Seal, condensed from Azure Luan True Lightning, wield?</p><p>Qin Sang put away the altar and activated the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form*, summoning his Azure Luan Dharma Image.</p><p>He hadn't cultivated this technique for years, but after taking Ling You Wang's pills, his progress was significant.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes again, linking his mind to his primordial essence, and experiencing his inner world.</p><p>After a moment, the Azure Luan Dharma Image's head moved slightly. It looked down at Qin Sang, its previously rigid expression now imbued with a hint of life.</p><p>Since Left Daoist had shown Qin Sang the path of inner and outer landscapes, Qin Sang had gained a deeper understanding of Dharma Images.</p><p>He was currently sensing the Azure Luan Dharma Image through his inner world. One day, perhaps he could use the power of his Dharma Image to greatly increase his strength, like the self-mutilated demon king.</p><p>Easy to say, but difficult to do. Other Demon Marquis found even comprehending their Dharma Image incredibly challenging.</p><p>Qin Sang had the Azure Luan Dharma Image first, and then he understood it; this made the process smoother than he’d anticipated.  Nevertheless, it quickly exhausted his mental energy, and he couldn't hide his fatigue when he finished.</p><p>Next, he needed to comprehend the Dharma Image and adjust his five elements.  The dwindling poisonous fruit extract and the difficult production of floral essence meant he couldn't proceed as smoothly as before.</p><p>After resting, Qin Sang opened the cave and saw Jian Nu guarding outside.</p><p>“Congratulations, Daoist, on taking another step toward the Dao!”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and thanked him.  “Thank you for protecting me, friend… have you collected the spiritual materials I asked for?”</p><p>Jian Nu replied, “Most have been located; nearly half have been obtained.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and gave Jian Nu a jade slip containing the refining methods for Heavenly Linglong and high-grade Spirit-Calming Incense.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Jian Nu was both surprised and delighted.  “I am unworthy of such a great gift, Daoist!”</p><p>Qin Sang reassured him, “Isn't protecting me enough? I also want to ask a favor. The spiritual materials listed within, keep a portion for yourself; take whatever remains.  If you need anything else, come to me.”</p><p>These materials were rare and hard to find in the Storm World, but occasionally appeared in this realm, and he was also keeping an eye out for them.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Jian Nu carefully put away the jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang sized Jian Nu up, voicing his concern, “In my opinion, you already possess the ability to attempt the Cave Xuan stage, and your chances of success are high. Why not try sooner?”</p><p>Jian Nu respectfully replied, “My master ordered me to continue honing my sword intent; I suppose my foundation is not yet sufficient.”</p><p>“I see.  Slow and steady wins the race! Once you reach the Cave Xuan stage, your progress will be phenomenal!”</p><p>Qin Sang understood. After a brief chat, he flew towards Hu Zhong Island.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had visited Bai Shi Zhi several times to consult with Yuan Zhenren, but he had not yet started repairing the war drum.</p><p>The Dao Court wasn't pressing him, and he was happy to delay.  Higher cultivation would benefit his refinement techniques.</p><p>“It’s time to start. But before that, I need to re-refine the Ming Shan Armor…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, entered Qi Manor, and instructed Qi Master’s disciple to open the furnace room.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>The end of this arc is approaching.</p><p>Taking a day off to organize the plot.
