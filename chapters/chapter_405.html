<h1>Chapter 398: Classification of Magical Treasures</h1><p>Thinking about magical treasures, Qin Sang retrieved Yu Hua's Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>Yu Hua's Ten Yama Envoys Formation had been destroyed by Qin Sang, but the magical treasures remained intact.</p><p>Now Qin Sang possessed two identical magical treasures, originating from the same source.</p><p>He learned from Yu Hua that before his ascension, Patriarch Kui Yin had passed down five Ten Yama Envoys Banners, one to each of his five disciples.</p><p>When the Kui Yin Sect was destroyed, Dove Robe Daoist and another Golden Core cultivator each had one, and another banner's whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Sun De had taken it with him when he infiltrated Lesser Hua Mountain.</p><p>Yi Tiannie possessed two banners, keeping one and giving the other to Zhao Yan to steal the Nine Phantasmal Orchid, which eventually ended up in Yu Hua's hands and, through a series of events, came to Qin Sang.</p><p>On the night of the upheaval, Yi Tiannie and the other Golden Core cultivator were killed on the spot.  Their Ten Yama Envoys Banners, if not destroyed, likely fell into the hands of the Yuan Zhao Sect.</p><p>Yu Hua had witnessed Dove Robe Daoist's natal magical treasure being destroyed by the self-detonation of the Yuan Zhao Sect Master. Dove Robe Daoist only escaped with his life thanks to the Ten Yama Envoys Banner, but even that was damaged and broken.</p><p>Later, Dove Robe Daoist was repeatedly pursued, his physical body destroyed and his Golden Core severely injured. The probability that his magical treasure was also destroyed was high.</p><p>Even if it wasn't destroyed, repairing it would be no easier than healing his own injuries. Otherwise, the Kui Yin Sect would have long since gathered all ten Yama Banners and restored Patriarch Kui Yin's prestige.</p><p>Now, of the five Ten Yama Envoys Banners, Qin Sang held two, the Yuan Zhao Sect held two, and Dove Robe Daoist had one.</p><p>The Ten Yama Envoys Banners were a set of magical treasures crafted by Patriarch Kui Yin with his life's work. It was said that when all ten banners were assembled and the demonic formation deployed, its power was comparable to a top-tier High-Grade Magical Treasure, and could even contend with a Supreme-Grade Magical Treasure!</p><p>Golden Core cultivators generally used magical tools, talismans, or Low-Grade Magical Treasures. Those with substantial resources or great fortune might obtain a Mid-Grade Magical Treasure, while only a select few possessed High-Grade Magical Treasures.</p><p>High-Grade and Supreme-Grade Magical Treasures were ultimate treasures exclusive to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>In the entire Small Cold Domain, Supreme-Grade Magical Treasures were extremely rare!</p><p>Relying on these banners, Patriarch Kui Yin established his demonic reputation and dominated the Small Cold Domain, making cultivators tremble at his name. Unfortunately, he lacked a successor, and now his legacy was broken.</p><p>Even a single Ten Yama Envoys Banner was considered top-tier among Low-Grade Magical Treasures!</p><p>Holding the two Ten Yama Envoys Banners, Qin Sang pondered whether, like magical tools, they needed to be assembled in a set of six to work together and form the demonic formation.</p><p>Yu Hua didn't know the answer either.</p><p>"It seems I'll need to reach the Golden Core stage to find out," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Those main souls had devoured most of his vital essence. Raising a single banner had taken almost all his strength; he couldn't possibly control two at the same time.</p><p>Putting away the banners, Qin Sang continued searching the Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>In the end, he only found three noteworthy High-Grade Magical Tools.</p><p>One, resembling a vajra, was twisted and completely useless, beyond repair.</p><p>The palm print deeply embedded in the vajra clearly indicated it was the work of the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>Another, called the Myriad Crows Gourd, initially seemed like a magical tool with special properties. After refining it, Qin Sang discovered it was a defensive tool.</p><p>The Myriad Crows Gourd released billowing smoke, transforming into countless crows that formed a defensive formation. It moved according to the user's will, both flexible and rigid, with endless variations.</p><p>Its power surpassed the Seven-Colored Umbrella, and its intuitive operation made it extremely convenient.</p><p>However, the gourd's smoke was currently depleted, likely exhausted while defending against the Flying Night Devil. It would need time to replenish.</p><p>There was also a flying sword. Qin Sang held it in his palm and examined it carefully.</p><p>A palm print stained with lingering corpse poison, also from the Flying Night Devil, marked the sword. Several cracks ran through the middle of the blade. Fortunately, it wasn't broken and could still be repaired.</p><p>It would be a good practice project once his refining skills improved.</p><p>"The Flying Night Devil's physical body is truly terrifying!" Qin Sang muttered, putting the tools away.</p><p>Just from what Qin Sang knew, Yu Hua had lost a Heart-Protecting Mirror, a vajra, and this flying sword, all High-Grade Magical Tools, to the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>Tempered by the Corpse Core and Earthly Yin energy, the Flying Night Devil's body was far tougher than any magical tool and could no longer be considered mere flesh and blood.</p><p>"It's a pity I don't want to follow the path of corpse refinement and use Earthly Yin energy to temper my body. In fact, I need to avoid it. Otherwise, with such a powerful physical body, wouldn't I be able to travel anywhere, heaven or earth?"</p><p>He continued searching but found no talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't discouraged. Those required preparation time as well.  The Ten Yama Envoys Formation and the banners were far more powerful than talismans and didn't have limited uses.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang took out two jade bottles, his eyes lighting up with delight.</p><p>They contained Dragon Departure Pills!</p><p>Similar to Spirit Gathering Pills, but far more potent, Dragon Departure Pills were exceptional for strengthening one's foundation and cultivating vital energy.</p><p>No wonder Yu Hua cultivated so quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang had left the Yuan Zhao Sect at twenty-five and was now seventy-two, less than fifty years in total.</p><p>It was important to note that Yu Hua wasn't particularly talented. Otherwise, he wouldn't have waited so long to break through to Foundation Establishment and betrayed his sect to become a spy for the demonic sects.</p><p>In fifty years, Yu Hua went from a newly established Foundation Establishment cultivator to the Pseudo-Core Realm, which was considered very fast in the cultivation world.</p><p>He must have consumed a considerable amount of elixirs and pills to have any left over.</p><p>Qin Sang happily pocketed the two bottles of Dragon Departure Pills, silently thanking Yu Hua for accelerating his own cultivation.</p><p>The greatest gains were the magical treasures and the Dragon Departure Pills. There were also several thousand spirit stones. Qin Sang categorized and stored the remaining items in his own Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>Finished with the spoils, Qin Sang felt a rush of exhilaration.  His losses were more than compensated for by these gains, though he hoped never to experience such a situation again.</p><p>Reviewing the events, from the moment Yu Hua forced him to reveal himself, every step had been precarious. One wrong move could have led to utter destruction. Qin Sang would rather never encounter such a situation again.</p><p>Learning that Yu Hua had entered the Boundless Valley searching for spiritual herbs and only pursued him after sensing the Heart-Devouring Insects, with no other accomplices, Qin Sang was relieved.</p><p>When he tried to question him further, Yu Hua's spirit began to fade.</p><p>The ice palace wasn't quiet.  Outside the ice walls, a blizzard raged, constantly battering the ice, producing a crackling sound.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside, still not seeing Cloud Wanderer. He wondered about his condition and whether he had obtained the Night Blooming Lily.</p><p>Severely injured, Qin Sang decided to stay in the ice palace to recuperate.</p><p>He didn't rush to remove the Heavenly Corpse Talisman. He would need it to deceive the Flying Night Devil when he left.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the ice palace, motionless. His chaotic spiritual energy gradually calmed, and with the help of pills and his cultivation technique, the injuries to his dantian and meridians began to heal.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>After an unknown period, Qin Sang emerged from his meditative state, exhaling a stream of turbid air.</p><p>Examining his internal condition, he found his injuries hadn't fully healed, but they no longer significantly impacted his strength.</p>
