<h1>Chapter 2063: Jiao Jiao</h1><p>Several figures silently descended onto the plain.  It was Qin Sang and his companions.</p><p>They had flown continuously, successfully escaping the dangerous sea area, but Si Lu suggested they stop.</p><p>“During the Great Fog Year, traveling around easily attracts suspicion.  We should find a place to hide and wait until the Fog Year passes before continuing our journey.  While we're at it, I'll try to get us legitimate identities so we don't have to keep hiding…”</p><p>During the Fog Year, unless on patrol duty, even practitioners of the Yi people would mostly remain in their caves to cultivate, avoiding going out.</p><p>After discussing it with Su Nu, Qin Sang agreed that it was a sound plan; traveling during the Fog Year did indeed risk unforeseen dangers.</p><p>One danger was the  Void Refinement stage fog beasts.  Another was the possibility, however small, of encountering a fog waterfall in the inter-tribal border areas, places already fraught with peril.  This was a possibility they couldn’t ignore.</p><p>Furthermore, Si Lu, having dedicated himself to cultivation and ignored worldly matters in the past, lacked knowledge in many areas and needed to gather information.</p><p>Looking around, the thick fog only allowed them to vaguely see several rolling hills on the horizon.  Several raised areas in the center of the plain were clearly dwellings, likely a settlement of Si You people.</p><p>Feeling the others looking at him, Si Lu felt a pang of shame. He'd never paid attention to anything outside cultivation and didn't know where they were.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu were secretly using their spiritual senses to perceive the energy fluctuations nearby.</p><p>“The spiritual energy here is weak, there shouldn’t be any powerful cultivators,” Su Nu said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, then looked towards a village.  “There's one cultivator in the village, but their cultivation is low, only at the Yuan Stage, first level.”</p><p>The entire plain didn't even have a single cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>“This is a remote area.  The people living here are mostly those who have been exiled. The primal energy is thin, making it difficult for high-level cultivators to appear. If fog beasts rarely appear here, the cultivators responsible for watching over this place wouldn't stay here permanently, only occasionally patrolling.”</p><p>After a slight sense check, Si Lu also discovered the one person, a child, and exclaimed, “This child must have just awakened their abilities. They haven't been sent to the county yet, likely delayed by the Fog Year. However, awakening abilities without refinement by the county masters is considered a prodigy among our Si You people. For this village to produce one, this lineage must be experiencing a stroke of incredible luck!”</p><p>Having a prodigy in the family is a great boon, potentially allowing them to leave this impoverished area and move to the county. Even if the child doesn't achieve great accomplishments, as long as their bloodline is passed down, their descendants will have an easier time awakening their abilities, essentially changing the family's destiny.</p><p>“Excuse me for a moment, I'll go and find out where the nearest city is…”</p><p>Si Lu's figure flickered, landing near the village. He gently rubbed his temples and cast a secret technique. Worried that a powerful Si You cultivator might be present, they avoided using their spiritual senses to scan the area, opting for this less conspicuous method of 'asking for directions'.</p><p>Moments later, everyone in the village was fast asleep, their snores resounding.</p><p>Si Lu quickly obtained his answer and returned.</p><p>Su Nu, having discovered some interesting things in the village, curiously asked, “Do you Si You people also form marital…?”</p><p>Realizing her mistake, she changed her words.  “Partnerships?”</p><p>The Si You people are self-sufficient in terms of gender, meaning they don't need Yin and Yang intercourse, nor do they have husbands or wives. Conception occurs through sensing energy.</p><p>Most families in the village, however, displayed a scene similar to men farming and women weaving, one partner being more Yin, the other Yang, forming partnerships, dividing labor, just like human couples.</p><p>Could there be a difference between ordinary Si You people and cultivators?</p><p>Si Lu was not surprised.  “Though our people are self-sufficient in terms of gender, it doesn’t prevent us from forming partnerships with others. If two people fall in love, they can adjust their internal Yin and Yang, the more Yang partner becoming like a human male and the Yin partner conversely like a human female, allowing for intercourse and conception; even ordinary people can do this. In fact, among ordinary people, this is the most common way. Firstly, two people together can alleviate loneliness and support each other, better than being alone.  Secondly, solo conception causes greater damage to one's own vitality.  However, many also choose to remain single…”</p><p>Si Lu pointed to some individuals living alone but still raising children.</p><p>“So, the couple can just switch roles at will, experiencing being a woman or a man as they please?  What an interesting pastime,” Su Nu chuckled.  “I wonder, who receives the bride price?”</p><p>“Bride price?”</p><p>Si Lu looked bewildered.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t listen any longer and interrupted Su Nu. “Did you find out the location of the county?”</p><p>“Please follow me…”</p><p>Si Lu pointed and led the way, flying and speaking, “This city also has a Chen Tower. I'll try to infiltrate the Chen Tower and get us identities."</p><p>Silu explained that Chenlou was a place where the royal family and regional princes of the Siyou tribe jointly taught and trained gifted children selected from various counties.  Entering Chenlou to study was the dream of every Siyou tribesman, and the young child would likely be accepted.</p><p>Crossing mountains, a city appeared. After a brief discussion, the group split into two. Su Nu, Gu Ya, and others found a place to hide, while Qin Sang and Silu entered the city.</p><p>During the Fog Year, the city's defenses were naturally strengthened. However, because the fog beasts lacked intelligence and strategy, the city gate’s security wasn't particularly tight. The two used a little trick to enter.</p><p>Qin Sang and Silu separated, carefully investigating several hidden locations within the city.  Confirming the absence of any powerful experts, they informed each other and began planning Silu's entry into Chenlou.</p><p>In the Yi Ren tribe's territory, Qin Sang couldn't offer much help, so they bought a courtyard and waited for news.</p><p>Given Silu's cultivation, it was impossible for anyone in the city to detect his actions. Silu quickly found an opportunity to obtain a plausible identity. Over the next few months, through further maneuvering, Silu was able to move openly.</p><p>During this time, Silu sent volumes of texts to Qin Sang. Unfortunately, this location was too remote and lacked texts detailing secrets. They would need to wait for the Fog Year to end and continue their investigation in other counties or even the royal capital to determine their next steps.</p><p>Fortunately, the Fog Year wouldn't last too long; after about a year, the dense fog would begin to dissipate.</p><p>One day, while Qin Sang was meditating in the room, they sensed the activation of a protective barrier, indicating Silu's arrival. They opened the courtyard gate.</p><p>Silu, using the alias Qi Zan, brought good news: "The Fog Dial indicates that the fog tide will recede in ten days!"</p><p>The Fog Dial was a treasure crafted by the Siyou royal family to transmit information to the entire land. The prediction of the fog receding in ten days, derived from calculations by powerful royals, was usually accurate.</p><p>"Are your arrangements complete?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Silu confidently replied, "I will travel under the alias Qi Zan, posing as a master with disciples. Even if the royal family investigates, they won't find any flaws!"</p><p>He flicked his sleeve, releasing several glowing orbs, which were suits of enchanted armor. "Our companions will pose as my attendants."</p><p>In Siyou society, those of high status were entitled to retainers. The enchanted armor would allow them to conceal their identities without arousing suspicion.</p><p>Leaving the city, they rejoined Su Nu and the others, waiting ten days in the mountains. Then, a ray of sunlight pierced the fog.</p><p>Instantly, their vision sharpened. Looking up, they saw a point of light in the sky.  It was midday.</p><p>This thought barely crossed their minds before they saw nearby mountain peaks clearly.  A few moments later, only wisps of fog remained, soon vanishing entirely.</p><p>In a short time, the sky-obscuring fog had vanished completely, revealing a vast, clear sky.  The warm sun dispelled the chill, reviving life.</p><p>They saw Siyou people in the city running into the streets, dancing and cheering.</p><p>They were astonished. They had been intently watching, but had not witnessed the fog's dissipation.  The fog's appearance and disappearance remained a mystery.</p><p>The fog sea held many strange phenomena. Silu, accustomed to it, signaled for the group to depart.</p><p>Over the following period, they appeared in various parts of the Siyou territory, finally infiltrating a royal city.  Their purpose wasn't to meet the regional prince, but to confirm certain information to finalize their next moves.</p><p>Again, only Qin Sang and Silu entered the city, Qin Sang disguised as a guard in enchanted armor.</p><p>After some time, they met in a private room of a tavern. Silu unfolded a nautical chart marking the territories of various royal clans, surrounded by fog.  He traced a crooked line. "We depart from here, passing through this area to enter the Hanhuang Kingdom.  Legend says there’s a passage through the fog, allowing travel between the two lands. My people have always guarded this area; the rumors are true.  The Hanhuang Kingdom is not friendly with us, which is why they won't allow my rivals to enter and hunt us down."</p><p>Qin Sang focused on that area of fog.  They had confirmed the rumors, but lacked a precise route.  More exploration would be needed.</p><p>However, with a clear direction, it wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, about to speak, when Silu’s gaze was drawn to the window, his expression changing.</p><p>"Do you know someone?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Si Lu nodded, looking surprised.  "I never expected to see him here..."</p><p>Qin Sang also looked out the window. The street was bustling with people; even in the royal city, cultivators were common. Two fourth-order Yuanjing members of the Si You clan just passed by below.</p><p>However, Si Lu was looking at a mortal.</p><p>This mortal had a tiny person sitting on his shoulder.  The little person had the same limbs and features as a human, but was only about the size of a thumb. He swung his little legs, looking at the street scene with a curious expression.</p><p>Despite his small size, the little person's cultivation was quite strong, comparable to a late-stage Transcendence cultivator. He was clearly using some kind of concealment technique; those around him were oblivious to his presence, and even the mortal he was riding was unaware.</p><p>"What clan is he from?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that the Yu clan, a subordinate clan of the Si You, didn't have anyone like this.</p><p>"He's not from our Yu clan. His people are called Jiao Jiao; they are small in stature but hold high status, one of the superior clans in our Heavenly Department."</p><p>Si Lu shook his head.  "His name is Ji Hong. I met him unexpectedly over a hundred years ago and even saved his life once. He said he was traveling and got into trouble. If I hadn't happened to be passing by and asked Summer Attendant to help, he would have been killed or severely injured. After recovering, he left our clan via a teleportation array. I didn't know he had returned."</p><p>"You saved him?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately grasped the key point, and thought for a moment. "How many people know about this?  Do you think he's trustworthy?"</p><p>Si Lu had saved Ji Hong's life, and Ji Hong's clan was on equal footing with the Si You, so there was no concern he would submit to Si Lu's enemies.</p><p>More importantly, this person traveled extensively, and might have useful information.</p><p>Si Lu recalled, "Only Summer Attendant and I were present. Not many people know. He has a straightforward personality. After I saved him, he was extremely grateful, it didn't seem feigned."</p><p>"Then let's invite him over."</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>Even if something unexpected happened, Ji Hong was only a Transcendence cultivator and easily controlled.</p><p>Si Lu hesitated. Those close to him in the past had betrayed him one after another, and he didn't want to experience that pain again.</p><p>If Ji Hong was also bought off by his enemies, he would lose another friend!</p><p>Si Lu sighed softly and took out a jade pendant. "Please go and get him, Daoist friend."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and disappeared instantly.</p><p>On the street, Ji Hong directed the mortal onto a quieter street.  He swung his legs, leaped from the mortal's shoulder, turned to look behind him, and pouted. "You've been following me for a while now. What is it? You think I'm small and weak and easy to bully? Don't forget the agreements between our superior clans!"</p><p>Space distorted slightly, and Qin Sang, clad in armor, appeared, bowing respectfully. "May I ask if you are Daoist Ji Hong?"</p><p>Ji Hong's eyes flashed, his tone becoming urgent.  "How do you know my name?"</p><p>He looked Qin Sang up and down, then hurriedly asked, "Who is your master?"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his palm, the jade pendant flashed past.  "My master is waiting for you, Daoist friend. If you wish to see my master, please come with me."</p><p>"Quickly!  Take me there quickly, Daoist friend!"</p><p>Ji Hong jumped onto Qin Sang's shoulder, urging him repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Ji Hong. This kid was incredibly informal. He quickly retracted his protective True Qi, preventing Ji Hong from being blown away.</p><p>He deliberately took a roundabout route. Seeing that Ji Hong showed no unusual behavior, he brought him to Si Lu.</p><p>"Daoist Si Lu, it really is you!"</p><p>Ji Hong was indeed straightforward; seeing Si Lu, his joy was evident. "You're still alive! That's great! When I heard about the unrest within the Si You clan, I immediately came here. I searched for you for a long time, almost covering the entire Si You territory. I thought you…"</p><p>He jumped onto the table, excitedly spinning. "That's great! That's great!"</p><p>Seeing Ji Hong so excited, Si Lu felt a strange emotion.  "I've worried you, Daoist friend."</p>
