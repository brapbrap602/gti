<h1>Chapter 201: Cloud Artefact</h1><p>Chapter 201: Cloud Artefact</p><p>After swallowing the elixirs, as he had expected, there were no changes to his qi sea. Qin Sang shook his head, abandoned any lingering fantasies, and cleared his disorganized thoughts to retrieve the brocade handkerchief from his mustard seed pouch.</p><p>The handkerchief was only the size of a human hand, square in shape with crude stitching. It seemed to be woven from some kind of tree bark, with no elaborate designs, appearing to be a very ordinary magic tool.</p><p>Oddly, a layer of gray mist wafted around it, making it seem somewhat sinister.</p><p>This kind of thing, that was neither quite a magic tool nor not a magic tool, could only be found on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and was called a “cloud artefact”.</p><p>As the name implied, cloud artefacts were forged from spiritually possessed objects from cloud beasts.</p><p>The prevailing theory was that the cloud beasts were formed from the countless corpses of ancient immortals, who had not decomposed even till today. After their deaths, some battle will remained within them, and this will then transform into a savage aura after many years of evolution. This savage aura would take shape and form strange creatures on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>When the savage aura took shape, the cloud beast spirit would emerge and attach itself to something. It could be an ordinary stone or a common blade of grass, or it could be spiritual medicine, spiritual wood, or ore. Sometimes, even wild beasts or monsters that originally inhabited the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would have their entire species contaminated by the cloud beast spirits. After countless years of reproduction and changes from generation to generation, they would become strange cloud beasts.</p><p>The moment these things were attached to a cloud beast spirit and transformed into cloud beasts, cultivators could kill the cloud beasts and obtain the objects that had been contaminated by the cloud beast spirits, known as spiritually possessed objects.</p><p>Since the savage aura was very violent and unstable, there was a high chance that it would dissipate after the cloud beast was killed, destroying the spiritually possessed object along with it. Hence, not every time one hunted a cloud beast, they would be able to obtain a spiritually possessed object.</p><p>Over countless years, cultivators had discovered a way to utilize spiritually possessed objects by refining them into cloud artefacts. By activating these cloud artefacts, the cultivators who entered the Ancient Immortal Battlefield could exude an aura similar to a cloud beast’s spirit, allowing them to fool the perceptions of cloud beasts and make them believe they were of the same kind.</p><p>Especially when celestial events occurred, if a cultivator could not find a shelter, they would have to go all out and fend off the celestial phenomenon.</p><p>If they did not use a cloud artefact to conceal their aura, their spiritual energy fluctuations would act as a beacon, attracting an unending number of cloud beasts in the vicinity. Even if they managed to withstand the celestial event, they would still be unable to escape being besieged by cloud beasts.</p><p>Of course, cloud artefacts were not omnipotent.</p><p>Firstly, this effect had a limited range. If one was already close to a cloud beast, they would still be discovered.</p><p>Secondly, if one were unfortunate enough to encounter a cloud beast that was too powerful, the cloud artefact would not be able to deceive its senses either. In such situations, one could only blame their poor luck.</p><p>Thirdly, because the cloud beast spirit was unstable, the refined cloud artefact could not be used for a long period either and was easily damaged, somewhat similar to the devil weapons like the Dragon Subduing Sword and the Falling Cloud Wings.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Evil Cultivator Yi had developed the devil weapons by studying the refining methods used for cloud artefacts and combining it with the strong cultivation base of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>This brocade handkerchief was a common cloud artefact.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to personally explore the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and naturally needed to equip himself with a cloud artefact for his safety. However, he had to return before a month was up and would not be venturing too far, so buying any one would suffice.</p><p>…</p><p>A month later, a light of escape streaked through the sky several meters above the ground and abruptly emerged from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the piercing sword cry attracting the attention of everyone on the ground, astonished that someone still dared to fly on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>The light of escape descended before reaching Skull Pass, revealing Qin Sang’s figure.</p><p>It was best not to fly on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield because there were bone-chilling windstorms in the sky, and because one would be too visible. If one were surrounded by cloud beasts, it would be very dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang had been cutting it so fine that he only dared to risk it because he was close to Skull Pass.</p><p>He was covered in dust, ignoring the strange gazes of the people around him, and hurried inside Skull Pass, the one-month deadline being the next day.</p><p>In the past month, Qin Sang had ventured as deep into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield as he could, almost not making it back in time. What he had experienced in the month had cemented his belief that he could not be an itinerant cultivator!</p><p>He was different from everyone else.</p><p>Others did not need to cultivate on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield permanently. Once they had sufficient gains, they could return to Skull Pass, whereas Qin Sang had to find a secluded cave to cultivate in.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang’s observations, there seemed to be a pattern in the way cloud beasts were distributed in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield—the deeper one went into the battlefield, the more common cloud beasts of higher strength would be.</p><p>Comprehending the Slaying Symbols placed certain requirements on the opponent—if the opponent was too weak, the training effects would be poor.</p><p>To gain adequate experience without delaying the cultivation time, it would be best on the outer area or at least at the junction of the border area and the outer area.</p><p>The safest one in this position is a town or market in the secret legacy land, where there are indeed caves for leasing, but the prices are amazingly high, which shocked Qin Sang.</p><p>It’s impossible to imagine opening up caves in the wild, because spirit beasts would be absorbed by spiritual energy and thus a place with rich spiritual energy has been around quite a few spirit beasts.</p><p>Even if one can pluck the teeth of a tiger and snatch a place, sealing up spiritual energy with an enchantment, it will be exposed when attacked by celestial phenomena and without depending on strong protection restriction, it can’t be guarded.</p><p>Retourning to the cave for a short recuperation, Qin Sang would go to the hall to find Yuyang Zi.</p><p>Yuyang Zi walked out quickly, asking with a smile“ I haven’t met Junior Brother Qin for so long, I assumed that you didn’t want to be restricted and planned to fight alone in the ancient immortal battlefield! I wonder what you are planning? As a xuanluwei or shadow guard?”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the jade talisman of the cave to Yuyang Zi, and asked in return “Senior Brother Yuyang Zi, I heard that the sect has a secret legacy land in the ancient immortal battlefield and needs disciples to guard it. Do you still have any vacancy?”</p><p>Yuyang Zi was slightly shocked, hesitated for a while and answered “Does Junior Brother Qin just ask it on a whim or do you insist on doing this work?”</p><p>Qin Sang said in a low voice “If given the opportunity, I’d like to try it.”</p><p>“This……”</p><p>Yuyang Zi looked around “Junior Brother Qin, let’s talk inside.”</p><p>The two of them lifted their feet to walk into the hall, Yuyang Zi cautiously transmitted his voice with caution: “Junior Brother Qin is new to this place and may not know much about the ancient immortal battlefield. The ancient immortal battlefield is unpredictable and only a few of the secret legacy lands have been opened up and occupied by the sect. Moreover, each secret legacy land is a secret of the sect and has strict requirements for the disciples guarding the secret legacy land. In addition, due to the fact that the disciples can share the benefits of the secret legacy land, nowadays it’s almost decided by convention that the people who guard the secret legacy lands are assigned by the grand uncles and grand aunts. If Junior Brother Qin also wants to do this, you’ll need your master’s dharma edict or ask a familiar Golden Core Perfected Person for help…”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang smiled bitterly, how could he have a master?</p><p>It’s because Yuyang Zi has been staying in Xuanguan Pass and doesn’t know about Qin Sang’s history.</p><p>“Senior brother, I don’t try to share the benefits in the secret legacy land, I just want to have a place to live, a cave suitable for cultivation with rich spiritual energy, is there any way to adjust one or two?”</p>
