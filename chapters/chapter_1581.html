<h1>Chapter 1572: Glacial Cave and Cold Crystal</h1><p>Back on the snowfield.</p><p>Yan Shan and Qin Sang, in their altered forms, relentlessly pursued the snow fox.  They kept their eyes on the fox while also carefully observing their surroundings.</p><p>No wonder Yan Shan and Si Tu Yu had failed so many times.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed they were close to the snow fox's lair, yet there were no unusual features, no trace of any barriers or spirit formations.</p><p>Furthermore, the snow fox felt strangely peculiar. Even low-intelligence ice spirits exhibit emotional fluctuations.  After being chased for so long, the snow fox hadn't once looked back, nor had it made a sound of fear or anger—calm, confident, and unafraid.</p><p>Could the snow fox be confident of its escape?</p><p>This thought had just crossed Qin Sang's mind, and he was about to speak to Yan Shan, when the fleeing snow fox suddenly vanished.</p><p>Normally, it would reappear from another direction, but this time, it truly disappeared.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Yan Shan pursued closely. They had reached the bottom of the ravines on the plain.</p><p>Standing on solid ground, the two quickly surveyed their surroundings – the intersection of several ravines.</p><p>A biting wind howled from every ravine, tiny ice particles colliding and shattering into a thick ice mist that would persist until the wind subsided.</p><p>This kind of terrain was common on the plains.</p><p>But that was precisely what was abnormal.</p><p>The snow fox, after fleeing for so long, had disappeared here.  This place must hold a secret!</p><p>Yan Shan looked around, finding nothing, and turned to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes glowed faintly, his mind linked to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, meticulously searching every inch of the area.</p><p>After a moment, seeing Qin Sang remain motionless, Yan Shan said, "We've already destroyed so many stone walls; it won't hurt to destroy this area too. Let's attack together and completely level the surrounding terrain! Whatever secret is here will be revealed."</p><p>Yan Shan then produced a thin rope, flicking his wrist, about to strike the stone wall to his right.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped Yan Shan, abruptly looking down at the ground.</p><p>Yan Shan paused, then quickly took to the air. "Is the snow fox's lair underground?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, hesitantly saying, "It doesn't seem like a lair..."</p><p>Through the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's vision, a fox image was visible on the ground.</p><p>The constant wind prevented any accumulation of loose earth in the ravines; the ground was polished smooth stone, covered with a thick layer of ice.</p><p>The image wasn't carved into the stone, but was embedded within the ice layer, floating on the stone's surface.</p><p>The fox was lifelike, identical to the snow fox, as if the snow fox itself were sealed within.</p><p>Like the snow fox's camouflage, this image was extremely faint; even if the snow fox were present, it would likely be overlooked, except by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>"The snow fox is hiding in the ice?" Qin Sang exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>To his senses, this ice was no different from any other, just ordinary ice; a little force would crack it.</p><p>Yan Shan's spirit sense probe yielded the same result.</p><p>"It's more than just a lair! Since you see the fox image, the mystery lies within the image itself.  Forcibly destroying it is impossible and we might fall for a trap. Draw the image, and we'll study it together to see what this creature is capable of," Yan Shan urged.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, and using his fingers, meticulously recreated the snow fox image in the air.</p><p>Yan Shan stared for a long time, deep in thought.</p><p>Qin Sang fixed his gaze on the ground, starting from the snow fox's head and following to its tail.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang had a sudden inspiration. "What if we treat this as a restriction or a rune? Perhaps the snow fox is inherently skilled in this."</p><p>Having obtained the complete legacy of the Yuan Shen Gate and having studied numerous texts at Xuan Tian Palace, his knowledge of formations and restrictions was considerable.  Approaching it from this angle, a new understanding dawned on him.</p><p>If the snow fox intended to hide this way, it greatly underestimated him and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, focusing on the snow fox's eyes; superficial observation revealed nothing more. The only option was to attack.</p><p>"I'll do it!" Yan Shan volunteered. "Keep a close eye on the snow fox; don't let it trick you."</p><p>Qin Sang considered this, stepped back a short distance, set up several array flags as a precaution, and pointed out the location of the snow fox's eyes to Yan Shan.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The thin rope shot out, bending in mid-air, its two ends poised to strike the snow fox's eyes.</p><p>Yan Shan stopped suddenly, a hint of shame in his voice.  "I hadn't anticipated Daoist Brother's capabilities, and neglected to discuss a plan beforehand."</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes. "What does Daoist Brother propose?"</p><p>"As a friend of Master Situ, and given our six months of acquaintance, your character is beyond doubt.  Your contribution in locating the Snow Fox is paramount."</p><p>Meeting Qin Sang's gaze, Yan Shan said frankly, "To be honest, that cold crystal would benefit me as well, but it's not an absolute necessity.  If we find it, we'll split it evenly.  If the quantity isn't enough for you, I'll gladly cede some.  However, should other treasures be found, the cold crystal goes to you, and I'll choose first among the remaining treasures, and so on. What do you say, Daoist Brother?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened.  His sole purpose was to obtain the cold crystal, and Yan Shan's proposal suited him perfectly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's agreement, Yan Shan's face brightened. He hesitated no longer, and swiftly launched a thin cord, piercing both of the Snow Fox's eyes.</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>The cord pierced through the ice and the Snow Fox's eyes, easily penetrating the stone and disappearing deep underground.</p><p>The ease of the attack surprised both of them.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>A brilliant white light erupted from the Snow Fox, its fur growing wildly into countless white threads that blanketed the ice, transforming it into a demonic fox radiating a strange power.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Within several li, the stone walls and ice shattered, forming a violent storm of rocks and ice fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yan Shan's faces changed, and they quickly retreated.</p><p>...</p><p>While Qin Sang and Yan Shan pursued,</p><p>Yue Fei left Luye alone, passing through heavy clouds, and landed at the edge of the snowfield.</p><p>She raised her jade arm, formed a hand seal to sense the cold spirit, confirmed the location, then draped a light veil over herself, her figure becoming indistinct.</p><p>Having concealed herself, Yue Fei was about to enter the snowfield when she stopped, changed direction, circling to the other side of the snowfield, flicking a beam of light into the snow before proceeding.</p><p>Guided by the cold spirit, Yue Fei effortlessly located their position.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang kept a close watch on the Snow Fox's movements.</p><p>But from the moment Yan Shan attacked the Snow Fox's eyes until now, the creature had vanished completely. Instead, they were in trouble, possibly trapped in a snare set by the Snow Fox.</p><p>Qin Sang had been cautious, maintaining a distance from Yan Shan to provide mutual support, but the blast's range was far greater than anticipated.</p><p>The storm swept towards them.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately activated the flag formation he had previously set up.</p><p>Flags fluttered, standing in all four directions, forming a yellowish-brown barrier.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The barrier was continuously assaulted, the impact incessant.  This was no ordinary storm; its power was extraordinary, the flags swaying violently, threatening to break the formation.</p><p>Yan Shan quickly retreated to Qin Sang's side, reaching for his waist and releasing three blue points of light which intertwined in the air, revealing their true form.</p><p>They were three bone shields, strangely shaped like the skulls of dragons.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Yan Shan shouted, and the three dragon-headed shields flew in different directions.  Water spurted from their mouths, merging with the flag formation, greatly increasing its defensive power.</p><p>Though this was their first time working together, their coordination was excellent.</p><p>Fortunately, Yan Shan acted swiftly.</p><p>As the dragon-headed shields took effect, blue glows erupted within the storm, revealing fist-sized ice balls spinning rapidly and propelled by the storm towards them.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The ice balls' power rivaled thunderbolts. The impact of their explosions shook the flags and dragon-headed shields, but they held firm.</p><p>"These ice balls… are similar to the cold煞energy within the cold crystal!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, then lit up.</p><p>Finding the cold crystal was paramount; letting the Snow Fox escape was acceptable.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang, Yan Shan immediately changed tactics, maneuvering the bone shields, and instead of retreating, advanced towards the storm's center.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't withdraw the Sky-Eye Butterfly's ability, continuing to search for the Snow Fox.</p><p>Despite discovering the familiar cold煞energy, he hadn't seen the cold crystal and remained vigilant for the Snow Fox hiding in the shadows.</p><p>Qin Sang found the situation increasingly strange. Did the Snow Fox truly possess such high intelligence to set such a trap?</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed with surprise that the surrounding environment had changed. The stone wall to his left, which had clearly shattered, had been restored.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, he hastily glanced to the right, and sure enough, a new stone wall had appeared. They were in a stone passage filled with a storm of ice balls.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave.  Unbeknownst to them, they had arrived at an unknown location.</p><p>...</p><p>When the storm appeared,</p><p>Yuefei happened to be nearby.  She first heard a rumbling roar, then saw the surrounding stone walls collapsing.  She gritted her teeth, and without waiting to see what was happening or for reinforcements, she charged into the storm without hesitation.</p><p>Outside the snowfield,</p><p>Qin Sang's main body looked puzzled.</p><p>"Two mid-Yuan Ying cultivators, chasing a mere snow fox, and they still encountered an accident?"</p><p>A moment ago, the connection between him and his clone had suddenly become extremely weak.</p><p>His external clone's abilities were at their peak, wielding a spiritual treasure and carrying both the Ruyi Treasure Pearl and the Tianmu Butterfly; few things in the world could threaten him.</p><p>Furthermore, the connection had only weakened, not disappeared, as if separated by a barrier.</p><p>His main body showed no urgency, his figure flashing as he entered the snowfield.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the storm,</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren controlled his Dragon Head Shield, deflecting the bombardment of ice balls. Hearing Qin Sang describe the incident, he snorted coldly, "What trick is that beast playing? Let's go in and find out!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>The two of them, working together, were not afraid of even Grand Cultivators.</p><p>For now, the storm and ice balls posed no threat to them; they could completely overwhelm them with their strength.</p><p>Qin Sang wielded the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade, holding it above his head, and instructed the Tianmu Butterfly to pay close attention to what lay ahead.</p><p>Before long, the storm's intensity subsided.</p><p>The two immediately increased their speed, charging forward, finally breaking through.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren changed his incantations, the Dragon Head Shield shooting back to circle him protectively. Qin Sang also retracted his flag array, the divine blade pointed forward.</p><p>They were not attacked.</p><p>Their vision was filled with a bluish-green expanse; they had entered an ice cave.</p><p>Icicles hung all around, thick layers of ice exuding a bone-chilling coldness.</p><p>"Could this be the source of the snowfield's cold energy?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the ice cave. Icicles hung upside down from above, ice pillars stood like a forest on the ground, it was a world of ice and snow, yet the snow fox remained unseen.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang noticed a clear, open area deep within the ice cave, distinctly different from its surroundings.</p><p>In the center of that area, stood a single eight-sided ice pillar, with a fist-sized ice ball atop it. Its color and texture were identical to the cold crystal sent by Situ Yu!</p><p>"A cold crystal!"</p><p>At the same time as seeing the cold crystal, Qin Sang noticed something else amiss.</p><p>Around the eight-sided ice pillar, etched onto the ice surface, was a spirit array composed of countless runes. The array was incredibly complex, and Qin Sang and the Tianmu Butterfly could not immediately discern its purpose, only that it was related to the Dao of Ice.</p><p>"This is artificially constructed."</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Such an array could never have formed naturally!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the cold crystal on the ice pillar. The person who had constructed the array was likely using this method to collect cold煞 energy, and the snow fox might have been their pet guardian beast.</p><p>They had inadvertently stumbled onto someone else's territory.</p><p>"It's definitely not the work of someone from this era," Yan Shan Lao Ren glanced at the ice pillar, his gaze darting around as if searching for other clues. His tone was certain. "If I'm not mistaken, using this method to collect it, it would probably take hundreds, even thousands of years, to form such a large cold crystal.  The owner of this place must have been gone for a very long time..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.</p><p>If that senior cultivator were still alive, they wouldn't have waited for the cold crystal to grow this large; they would have harvested it long ago. The size of the cold crystal didn't affect its efficacy.</p><p>The cultivation world is unpredictable.</p><p>A cultivator's painstaking preparations may not be enjoyed by themselves.</p><p>However, taking the cold crystal probably wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his attention on the spirit array surrounding the cold crystal, about to study it, when the Tianmu Butterfly suddenly gave a warning.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang spun around sharply, the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade trembling slightly.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren hadn't noticed anything unusual, but seeing Qin Sang's movement, his expression changed, and he quickly moved the Dragon Head Shield to the rear.</p><p>The next moment,</p><p>A glamorous woman burst from the storm—Yuefei.</p><p>Their eyes met, both startled.</p><p>Yuefei, clad in light gauze, raised her jade arm and attacked first, a puff of smoke escaping her hand, directly towards Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Qin Sang had kept the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade hidden, intending to ascertain the person's identity before acting. If they were the owner of this place, he might negotiate a trade.</p><p>But the other party attacked without a word.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>Two pink lightning bolts shot out from the smoke, simultaneously targeting Qin Sang and Yan Shan Lao Ren.</p><p>'Bang bang' two sounds.</p><p>One struck Yan Shan Lao Ren's Dragon Head Shield, the other strangely pierced Qin Sang's flag array, instantly nearing him.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang reacted quickly, immediately activating the Ruyi Treasure Pearl within him, and the lightning was blocked by the pearl's protective aura.</p><p>In an instant,</p><p>Qin Sang and Yan Shan Lao Ren's faces were as dark as water.</p>
