Chapter 1838: Sword Cry


Qingluan's shadow was cast upon the stone wall of the cave dwelling.
Qin Sang, bathed in the azure light, breathed deeply, then fell into a long silence.
The Qingluan Dharma Idol slowly flapped its wings, circling above Qin Sang's head, its beautiful radiance shimmering.
Soon, a drum-like rumble emanated from within Qin Sang, as if his flesh, blood, and marrow were all vibrating together. An extremely vigorous surge of vital energy erupted outwards.
Purple-red light quickly filled the cave dwelling, flickering with various profound runes. Faint shadows of banners and flags appeared, indicating that the protective formation of the cave had been impacted, its power activated.
Vital energy surged.
The Qingluan Dharma Idol flapped its wings faster, its neck raised in a cry, as if it would break free from its constraints and soar into the heavens at any moment.
Unfortunately, this didn't last long.
Qin Sang's aura, after surging to a certain point, could no longer be sustained. It stalled from its continuous rise, struggling to maintain itself for a short time before reluctantly receding.
Immediately afterwards, the azure light of the Qingluan Dharma Idol also dimmed, its momentum waning.  Finally, it transformed into a beam of azure light and returned to Qin Sang's body.
Gradually calming his agitated vital energy, Qin Sang opened his eyes and murmured, "I failedâ€¦"
A butterfly shadow flickered. Tianmu Butterfly flew back from the cave entrance. Sensing its master's low spirits, it gently brushed its wings against Qin Sang's face, the only way it knew to comfort him.
Qin Sang's eyes quickly regained their sparkle. Looking at the Tianmu Butterfly trying to comfort him, a smile touched his lips. He raised his hand, allowing the butterfly to land on his fingertip, and retrieved a Yinghua Pill.
In the past, as soon as Qin Sang took out a Yinghua Pill, Tianmu Butterfly would grab at his fingers to snatch it. If Qin Sang didn't give it to her immediately, her eyes would instantly cloud with tears.
Now, however, Tianmu Butterfly seemed not to notice the pill. The eye-like patterns on her wings stared fixedly at Qin Sang, flickering slightly as if observing his expression.  Only after confirming that his mood had recovered did she carefully refine the Yinghua Pill and obediently fly to his shoulder.
In fact, this failure was within Qin Sang's expectations. He had only recently reached the peak of the mid-stage of the fifth level of the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* a few days ago and was eager to attempt a breakthrough, ill-prepared as he was.
Tianmu Butterfly's mood had become subdued because of her master, so Qin Sang, in turn, comforted her for a while, reflecting on the breakthrough process.
Though he failed, he still gained something.
"There's still plenty of Poison Fruit pulp. The breakthrough shouldn't be too difficult," Qin Sang thought to himself. His figure flickered, and he appeared outside the cave dwelling, flying into the aperture.
He had cleared all the shadows within the aperture, leaving only the Poison Fruit hanging in the void.
Compared to decades ago, the Poison Fruit's luster had dimmed and shrunk. Its skin was wrinkled and somewhat shriveled, as if dried by the wind and devoid of moisture.
This was because Qin Sang continuously extracted its pulp without replenishing it with new flower dew.
The rich and potent poisonous energy within the Poison Fruit had supported Qin Sang's rapid progress in a short time, bringing him close to a breakthrough.
At least before the Poison Fruit pulp was exhausted, his cultivation speed wouldn't slow down.  Such an achievement would be incredibly shocking in anyone's eyes.
Qin Sang skillfully extracted a drop of pulp and sealed it in a jade bottle before exiting the aperture.
Just as he was about to return to the cave dwelling, he suddenly stopped and turned to look towards the back of the flower field, in the direction of the depths of the Healing Platform.
He had already reached a bottleneck. No matter how hard he cultivated, he couldn't progress any further.  It would be better to take advantage of this time to explore the Healing Platform.
Venturing into various strange illusions might bring him inspiration, beneficial for his breakthrough.
Qin Sang made his decision, but he wasn't in a hurry to act. He first returned to the cave dwelling to consolidate his cultivation. Then, he summoned the Cauldron, released the Fire Jade Centipede, and retrieved a Qing Frost Pill.
The potency of the first pill had already been absorbed by the Fire Jade Centipede.
The spiritual pill was ingested.
The Fire Jade Centipede's reaction was largely the same as last time. Its entire body curled up, struggling against the impact of the pill's potency in agony, desperately seeking an opportunity for a breakthrough.
This time, the fluctuation of the Fire Jade Centipede's aura was stronger than last time. Unfortunately, it eventually subsided, still failing to succeed.
"We share the same plight," Qin Sang shook his head, withdrawing the Fire Jade Centipede back into the Cauldron. A shadow of gloom flickered in his eyes.
After consuming two pills, the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't undergone any qualitative change. If this continued, even if it consumed a third Qing Frost Pill, it would likely be difficult to achieve the desired result.
Qin Sang frowned, deciding to select a few secret techniques from the *Panhu True Scripture* and invest more effort in the Fire Jade Centipede.
Several days later, Qin Sang left the flower field and followed the path in his memory, venturing deeper into the Healing Platform.
Thousands of Crimson Gold Spirit Needles came into view.
Qin Sang returned to the place he had visited with Mo Xingdao, carefully observing the reflections before him. As long as he figured out the reason for the reflections here, he should be able to pinpoint the location of the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles.
Floating before the reflections, the reflected Crimson Gold Spirit Needles seemed close at hand, some even brushing past the tip of Qin Sang's nose.
Even though he was certain that the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles were all reflections, the threat they posed was extremely real.
An incredibly sharp aura emanated from the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles. They were endless, yet unable to harm each other, locked in this stalemate for an unknown number of years, persisting to this day.
Millions of each color of spirit needle attacked each other, clashing head-on in the center, then dissolving together.
Rashly entering would mean experiencing the agony of being pierced by thousands of needles.
Qin Sang's eyes gleamed. He silently activated his Heavenly Eye divine ability, observing for a period of time it takes an incense stick to burn, before suddenly stepping into the sea of needles.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

The sound of needles piercing the air instantly filled his ears, omnipresent from all directions.
Qin Sang's pupils contracted sharply. A golden spirit needle happened to strike, about to pierce his right eye.
A stinging pain shot through his right eye. Qin Sang's heart pounded violently, yet he showed no intention of dodging and offered no resistance.

*Swish!*

The golden spirit needle pierced directly into his right pupil. The stinging sensation reached its peak then abruptly vanished.
Qin Sang was unharmed. The spirit needle passed through his head, reappearing behind him and continuing towards the crimson spirit needles opposite.
At the same time, the other spirit needles that pierced Qin Sang behaved similarly, passing through him as if he didn't exist.
"It truly is a reflection..."
Qin Sang thought.
That stinging sensation was too real. If it were anyone else, even if they saw the clues, they wouldn't dare to try it so readily.
Qin Sang paused for a moment before continuing forward, traversing within the sea of needles unharmed.
He changed direction, entering the area of crimson spirit needles opposite, carefully observing. After traveling like this for a while, Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation, finding himself having walked out of the sea of needles.  A patch of auspicious clouds appeared ahead.
"This..."
Qin Sang frowned, somewhat puzzled.
The reflections of the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles certainly wouldn't appear here without reason. It should be caused by a special kind of illusion. Yet, he hadn't detected anything unusual even after passing through the sea of needles.
Qin Sang turned, gazing at the sea of needles, lost in thought. Then, he sat cross-legged among the auspicious clouds, letting Tianmu Butterfly land on his shoulder, using a blood essence secret technique as a catalyst to activate his divine ability with all his might.
In his vision, the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles changed. What he saw were no longer individual needles but their trajectories, forming crimson and gold threads in the void.
The threads were densely packed, like countless strings of a zither.
Then, the threads gradually faded from Qin Sang's eyes. It wasn't that the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles disappeared, but rather that Qin Sang intentionally ignored them, eliminating all interference, peering through the reflection to glimpse the truth.
Under the effect of the Witch Tribe secret technique, both the eye-like patterns on the butterfly's wings and Qin Sang's eyes turned blood-red, emitting a demonic glow.
As the threads faded, the void was completely revealed before him, seemingly empty.
Gradually, a knowing smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.  He took Tianmu Butterfly and returned to the sea of needles, quickly traversing it, arriving at the center.
The two types of spirit needles converged here. Qin Sang, as if not seeing them, raised his right hand and slid it vertically through the void.
Where his fingers passed, a faint mark remained, as if a fissure had opened in the void, but it vanished in an instant.
Qin Sang pondered, then unhesitantly summoned the Qingluan Dharma Idol.
The Dharma Idol merged into his body, greatly increasing his power.  Forming a Buddhist hand seal, he struck out with his palm.

*Boom!*

The void trembled.
The reflection of the sea of needles rippled like water. A void abruptly appeared where the needles converged, like a door. Qin Sang instantly twisted his body and squeezed into the fissure, bizarrely vanishing into thin air.
The ripples subsided, and the sea of needles returned to normal.
A moment later, Qin Sang suddenly reappeared, staggering back several steps, rather disheveled, as if he had been expelled from within.
After regaining his footing, Qin Sang stared at the spot where he had entered, a strange glint in his eyes.
Passing through the reflection and entering the true space, he was met with pitch darkness. He and Tianmu Butterfly hadn't seen anything before a powerful repulsive force pushed them out.
Using both the Dharma Idol and Buddhist hand seal was his greatest strength, yet it was still insufficient to stand within that space.
Fortunately, the repulsive force wouldn't cause injury.
Qin Sang pondered for a moment before once again blasting open the door to reality.
He entered again and again, only to be repelled each time.  Within the Healing Platform, there was no distinction between day and night, as if he knew no fatigue.
Despite the extremely short duration of each stay, with his persistent efforts, he finally made a new discovery.
His eyes gradually brightened, and a hearty laugh accompanied his expulsion the last time.
Qin Sang retreated all the way to the auspicious clouds, looking at his palm, circulating spiritual energy to draw in the air.
Several runes were formed in one stroke.
Each rune seemed incomplete, barely holding its form, yet they were among the most complex runes Qin Sang had ever seen.
The runes transformed into a black disc.
The black disc was as deep as a black hole. Qin Sang examined it, then pressed his left hand against it. A circular mark instantly appeared on his palm.
Sensing the rune mark, Qin Sang nodded inwardly, "Indeed!"
This incomplete rune was his only harvest from the darkness. He didn't know its origin or function, but with the help of the rune, Qin Sang felt a vague connection, seemingly emanating from the depths of the Healing Platform.
He speculated that the reason for the reflections here was due to these fragmented runes.  The other part of the runes projected the scene there through a special connection, reflecting it here.
Following the connection of the rune mark might lead him to the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles, undoubtedly simpler than searching aimlessly.
Qin Sang's face showed relief. He began to meditate on the spot, recovering to peak condition before following the faint connection, venturing into the depths of the Healing Platform.
The space of the Healing Platform was more profound and dangerous than he had imagined, full of the unknown.
The further he went, the more strenuous Qin Sang felt.  He was constantly prepared to deploy the Dharma Idol and Buddhist hand seal. Even so, he sometimes had to disregard the danger, attempting multiple times to barely pass through an illusion.
Each dangerous encounter also broadened Qin Sang's horizons. Every new illusion was a novel experience.
One month later.
Qin Sang entered a long corridor, filled with various grotesque beings wandering within, which he slaughtered all the way through.
The third month.
Qin Sang entered a stone forest and was attacked, yet never saw the enemy's form from beginning to end.
At the cost of injury, he figured out some patterns and arduously made his way out of the stone forest.
The sixth month.
Qin Sang entered a landmass and was besieged by peculiar monsters composed of water.
The monsters took on various forms, lacking sentience, like puppets.  After being dispersed, they wouldn't disappear, but instead merge with their kind, strengthening their power.
This time, Qin Sang was held up for nearly a year. He tried to bypass them but eventually had to return, repeatedly repelled by the final monster.
Finally, with Tianmu Butterfly's help, he found a weakness in the monsters and set a trap to overcome this obstacle.
The second year's end.
Qin Sang arrived at a void.
As soon as he entered the space, an immense pressure descended from above. A gigantic primordial stone appeared out of thin air and crashed down.
No matter which direction he entered from, he couldn't avoid the stone.
Qin Sang's entire body was enveloped in dazzling azure light. He raised his hands high, his veins bulging, desperately holding up the gigantic stone, arduously taking a step forward.
With each step, the stone grew heavier.
One step, two steps... ten steps... one hundred steps...
Qin Sang's arms trembled, his face flushed.

*Boom!*

The stone suddenly grew heavier.
His arms bent sharply, nearly crushed by the stone. Qin Sang roared, his vital energy surging, forcibly lifting the stone once more.
At the same time, Qin Sang's eyes flashed brightly. He immediately gave up on advancing, retreating backward.
This retreat took him directly back to the flower field, his first return to the cave dwelling in two years.
Back in the cave dwelling, Qin Sang couldn't wait to sit down and circulate his cultivation technique.
A few days later, a resounding phoenix cry echoed from within the cave dwelling. The raging vital energy nearly breached the protective formation.
The late stage of the fifth level of *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* achieved!
Qin Sang looked up at the Qingluan Dharma Idol, contemplating for a long time.
Having reached the late stage, the Qingluan Dharma Idol had become more solidified, but it hadn't condensed into a true Dharma Idol as Qin Sang had hoped.  There was no qualitative change.
The gap between Nascent Soul and Soul Formation was like a chasm, not something a mere cultivation technique could bridge.
However, the improvement in the Dharma Idol and his physical body also brought about earth-shattering changes for Qin Sang.
If he were to face Xiahou now, he would definitely not be as battered as last time, even if both of Xiahou's forms were at their peak.
At the same time, Qin Sang confirmed a long-held suspicion. The illusory Dharma Idol of the Nascent Soul realm wasn't truly meant to enhance combat prowess but to allow cultivators a glimpse into the path of the Dharma Idol, greatly benefiting future breakthroughs.
He was still at the stage of knowing what it was but not knowing why, but as he continued to progress, he would surely gain enlightenment.
After the breakthrough, Qin Sang stabilized his vital energy and shifted his focus to the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*. It was time to elevate his realm.
There was no need to rush the subsequent cultivation.
Qin Sang had sufficient strength to venture deeper and could divide his attention, cultivating while searching for the path to ascension.
Five years later.
Qin Sang once again left the cave dwelling and entered the depths of the Healing Platform.
This time, he effortlessly carried the giant stone to the other side.
Having been here several times before, he smoothly passed through the next few illusions, arriving at the one that had previously stopped him.
He was repelled after several attempts.
Qin Sang couldn't help but frown.  The methods he had devised during this time seemed useless.
After pondering for a moment, he prepared to try again.
Just as he was about to step into the illusion, he suddenly froze, a look of pleasant surprise appearing in his eyes.
Within his Purple Mansion, a sword cry resonated!
