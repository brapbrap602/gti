<h1>Chapter 1188: Stalemate</h1><p>Chapter 1188: Stalemate</p><p>The three sat down to divide the spoils.</p><p>As a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, Old Master Pei's wealth was considerable.</p><p>Magic treasures, spirit materials, pills, spirit stones—he had it all.</p><p>Si Di and Jing Lin insisted that Qin Sang take the lion's share, and Qin Sang didn't refuse. He first selected several items he urgently needed, adding them to his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>His assets had never matched his status and cultivation; now, after defeating a Nascent Soul cultivator, he finally didn't look so impoverished.</p><p>However, even with several magic treasures, none were quite satisfactory. While Pei's lifebound treasure was a high-grade magic treasure, its power was significantly reduced when used by others.</p><p>These were far inferior to the Twelve Devil Banners and the Ebony Sword, so he would use them temporarily before passing them on to his descendants.</p><p>Si Di and Jing Lin divided the remaining items equally and were both quite pleased.</p><p>"Once the battle report is submitted, we'll receive even greater rewards!"</p><p>Jing Lin said cheerfully.</p><p>Killing a Nascent Soul cultivator like Zui Yuan was no small feat, and the Two Realms Alliance had always been generous.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had delivered the killing blow, he wouldn't have succeeded without their cooperation, so the three decided to share the merit equally.</p><p>"This time, Daoist Friend made a name for yourself, scaring both Chan Ling and Old Master Tan into retreating without a fight. Zui Yuan knows of Daoist Friend Mingyue's reputation and will surely investigate you secretly, trying to find ways to target you."</p><p>Jing Lin offered a friendly warning.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried; it wouldn't be easy to ambush him.</p><p>Of course, caution was necessary; there were countless divine abilities in the world, and he might encounter an opponent who countered his strengths.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him and turned to Si Di, "My fire banners and thunder techniques are all killing arts. At most, Zui Yuan will prepare some protective methods, which won't significantly impact me. But Daoist Friend Si is different. You exposed your life-saving ability to Chan Ling and Old Master Tan, so you must be extra careful in the future."</p><p>Qin Sang greatly admired Si Di's decisiveness and courage.</p><p>It was rare for a Nascent Soul Grandmaster to willingly act as bait and put themselves in harm's way.  His ability to swap places with his lifebound treasure was undoubtedly a powerful escape technique.  However, once discovered and anticipated, its effectiveness would be greatly reduced.</p><p>Hearing this, Si Di and Jing Lin suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>Si Di, smiling, briefly explained, "Daoist Friend Mingyue doesn't know, but the conditions for using my technique are extremely stringent, and it's impossible to use it during a fight. First, we were in the Cold Bell Formation, and second, I had prepared for this months ago before it could be used. If an opponent focuses on counteracting this technique, I would welcome it! With the merit from this battle, I can finally acquire a material I've long desired. Once I integrate it into the Yuejin Mirror, this treasure will undergo a qualitative change, and I can then turn the tables and make them pay…"</p><p>"Daoist Friend even anticipated this, I'm truly impressed."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly marveled. These old Nascent Soul cultivators were truly cunning, one scheme after another.</p><p>"Since Daoist Friend Si has been stationed at Sandie Pass, Pei and Tan have never gained any advantage. It wasn't just his cultivation!"</p><p>Jing Lin praised.</p><p>Si Di modestly deflected the compliment.</p><p>After working together to defeat the enemy, their relationship had clearly improved. Si Di and Jing Lin became even warmer towards Qin Sang, tactfully avoiding any questions about the devil banners and the lightning summoning technique.</p><p>At Qin Sang's subtle prompting, the conversation turned to the幽晶塔 (Youjing Tower) and the灭魂锥 (Miehun Cone).</p><p>"Before, the Xuan Shield Talisman couldn't completely block the Miehun Cone, but it bought us time to evade. Old Master Pei used some secret technique; the Miehun Cone's power far surpassed what we'd seen before. We must take this seriously; I'll send a message to Daoist Friend Zhen immediately."</p><p>Jing Lin's tone was serious.</p><p>His wounds hadn't healed yet, and he spoke of the Miehun Cone with considerable apprehension.</p><p>With the Xuan Shield Talismans failing, the Two Realms Alliance needed to find stronger protective measures as soon as possible.</p><p>Si Di continued, "This Miehun Cone shouldn't be something that can be easily used. I noticed that Old Master Pei acted strangely at the last moment. You two were closer and should have seen more clearly than I did."</p><p>The two looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, "Daoist Friend Si is correct. Before using the Miehun Cone, Old Master Pei aged hundreds of years in an instant, as if most of his vitality had been drained."</p><p>After a moment of thought, Jing Lin's expression suddenly changed, "Old Master Pei sacrificed himself to the Youjing Tower! That thing is truly an evil artifact!"</p><p>"Given how much Nascent Soul cultivators value their lives, they wouldn't willingly sacrifice themselves unless absolutely necessary. However, we must be prepared. Even in his haste, Pei could still injure you two. If someone else makes a selfless sacrifice with malicious intent, no one knows how much damage they could inflict."</p><p>Si Di said gravely.</p><p>Three of them conferred for a full hour.</p><p>Qin Sang learned about the Abyss in detail, especially the Dark Crystal Tower, but found no information he sought.</p><p>After seeing Jing Lin and Si Di off, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his mind unsettled.</p><p>His intuition told him the Dark Crystal Tower was most likely connected to the ancient demons, but lacked any concrete evidence to present.</p><p>“After this crushing defeat, things at Threefold Pass should calm down for a while.  I should visit my senior sister at Stone Melody Mountain.  Regardless, I must secure a retreat…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.  The Demon Lord slaughtered Nascent Souls like mowing grass.  Qin Sang didn't object to contributing to the defense against the Abyss, but he wasn't willing to sacrifice his life.</p><p>He didn't need to flee ten thousand miles away just yet, either.  The Abyss wasn't that powerful; there might be other factors at play.</p><p>After the great battle, Threefold Pass returned to peace, and news finally arrived from Stone Melody Mountain.</p><p>This time, the Abyss launched a massive, all-out attack. They set a trap, targeting Stone Melody Mountain and several nearby strongholds. Fortunately, the Two Realms Alliance was prepared, having summoned the Demon King beforehand.</p><p>Initially caught off guard, they gradually repelled the Abyss's offensive once reinforcements arrived, stabilizing the situation.</p><p>The most exhilarating news was that Threefold Pass, despite being slightly weaker, killed one of the Abyss's Nascent Souls.</p><p>The name of the Moonlit Demon King spread quickly, and their reputation soared.</p><p>A few days later, Qin Sang found Jing Lin and Si Di, stating his intention to visit Stone Melody Mountain.  He used the excuse that a minor demon from the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea had brought word.</p><p>Si Di, having acquired a desired treasure, was beaming with confidence.  "That Zen Ling is a coward. He wouldn't dare act without thoroughly investigating your abilities.  Rest assured, we'll take good care of them once you bring them."</p><p>Stone Melody Mountain.</p><p>Originally a major city of the Celestial Walk Alliance, all civilians had been evacuated, leaving the vast city desolate.</p><p>Stone Melody Mountain was heavily guarded.  Qin Sang identified himself and gained entry.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator led Qin Sang to a hall in the governor's mansion and quickly went to report to Master Zhen.</p><p>Master Zhen was personally stationed at Stone Melody Mountain, while the Profound Void Demon Lord guarded East Watch City.  Other individuals, including Senior Sister Qing Jun, were at Stone Melody Mountain, while Dongyang Bo assisted the Profound Void Demon Lord at East Watch City.  The Celestial Walk Alliance's experts were similarly stationed in the two locations.</p>
