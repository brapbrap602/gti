<h1>Chapter 1684: Above and Below</h1><p>Above.</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe, having obtained the Demon Sealing Stake, communicated telepathically with Fan Laomo and the others.  He then manifested a lotus throne beneath him, sat cross-legged, and raised a single hand.</p><p>Instantly, a sea of light appeared below the lotus throne, radiating boundless Buddhist power, a sight beyond comprehension.</p><p>The source was the halo behind Hui Guang Shengzhe's head.  At its center shone a Buddha's image, majestic and serene, like a true Buddha.</p><p>As the sea of light undulated, the sound of chanting subtly reached everyone's minds.</p><p>Everyone knew this wasn't an illusion. The halos behind their own heads were displaying a wondrous rhythm, echoing Hui Guang Shengzhe's, exhibiting the same fluctuations.</p><p>This resonance was the foundation of the Zen Meditation Arhat Formation. Hui Guang Shengzhe remained the array's core, but his tasks were too numerous to focus on combat. Instead, he used the Buddha image in his halo as a substitute.</p><p>This image could be considered a fragment of Hui Guang Shengzhe's spirit, or a manifestation body, created solely for the formation, retaining only combat instincts to maintain its operation.</p><p>This meant Hui Guang Shengzhe couldn't personally intervene, weakening the formation's power. However, the auras of those within the array still centered around the Buddha image, remaining unified to fight the ancient demon, preventing disarray.</p><p>Unable to stray too far from the battlefield, Hui Guang Shengzhe flew on his lotus throne to a safer outer perimeter, entering a meditative state and closing his eyes.</p><p>His other hand held the Demon Sealing Stake.</p><p>The broken pieces were seamlessly rejoined, showing no visible flaw. But repairing such a treasure wasn't so simple.</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe's white eyebrows trembled slightly, his kasaya rippling gently.</p><p>Those paying close attention then saw a tiny spark of light slowly drifting from his chest; a minuscule flame.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang's expression shifted, showing subtle surprise.  Her senses detected nothing from this flame; only her eyes perceived it. There was no detectable energy fluctuation or heat.</p><p>To the naked eye, the flame seemed unreal, transparent, almost nonexistent.</p><p>This is the old bald donkey's heart fire? It doesn't resemble a true spiritual flame. Is it some Buddhist supernatural power?</p><p>This thought flashed through Qinghu Shengwang's mind, interrupted by a piercing sound.  A five-colored light pierced towards her like lightning, its demonic body driven by bloodlust, attracted to her pure and potent energy.</p><p>Unaffected, Hui Guang Shengzhe's heart fire expanded, creating a towering pillar of flame.  Though still transparent and illusory, it radiated immense power.</p><p>An astonishing sight unfolded: the heart fire continued to expand, engulfing both the monk and the Demon Sealing Stake before everyone's astonished eyes.</p><p>The heart fire burned fiercely.</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe's form blurred, seeming to merge with the flame. Only the lotus throne remained unchanged.</p><p>At this moment, the old monk had become a fiery furnace.</p><p>Within the flames, the Demon Sealing Stake disappeared, leaving only a denser mass of heart fire, undergoing endless transformations.</p><p>Using himself as a crucible, his heart as the fire, he was refining the Demon Sealing Stake!</p><p>Throughout the ruins, above and below, all cultivators observing the battlefield could see this flame, their hearts filled with worry for Hui Guang Shengzhe.</p><p>The battle's outcome rested solely on him, the pressure unimaginable.</p><p>Furthermore, Hui Guang Shengzhe was also maintaining the Dharma Flower True Wheel and protecting the Poison King—three tasks at once!  The mental strain was immense, even for a Nascent Divinity cultivator. It pushed him to his limit, especially considering his existing injuries.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang, facing the ancient demon, was equally pressured.</p><p>The five-colored light converged, forming a needle of light, unbelievably sharp.</p><p>Locked by the light needle, Qinghu Shengwang felt a mortal threat. Raising an eyebrow, she didn't dare confront it directly, her form vanishing instantly.</p><p>The next moment, water pillars erupted from the lake, each transforming into a Qinghu Shengwang, each with a different expression, their elegance matching the original.</p><p>Dividing her true form into countless illusions—a famous celestial fox illusion technique from the East Sea.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the five-colored needle proved more cunning than anticipated, unfazed by the illusions, its trajectory shifting to pierce the space between two illusions.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>An alluring figure appeared—Qinghu Shengwang's true form, hidden there.</p><p>Had they not known the demon's current state, they would have thought it retained its rationality and possessed the divine ability to see through illusions.</p><p>Understanding this was an inherent power of the spiritual treasure, Qinghu Shengwang ceased dodging. She drew a circle in front of her, conjuring a water mirror.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>Five-colored needles pierced the water mirror.</p><p>At that moment, a copper bowl, Xuan Qi, jade smoke, and a three-legged cauldron arrived simultaneously, merging into a single beam of light descending from the heavens.  The time bought by the Qinghu Saint King was enough for those within the Chan Ding Lohan formation to react and launch a combined attack.</p><p>The water mirror suddenly reversed.  Its surface now faced upward, carrying the five-colored needles, perfectly intercepting the descending beam of light.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The five-colored needles were instantly engulfed in the onslaught.</p><p>Before anyone could see if the needles had shattered, a piercing shriek echoed, a demonic sound assaulting their minds, their primordial spirits feeling as if pierced by countless needles, causing excruciating headaches.</p><p>A tremendous roar.</p><p>The void suddenly darkened, countless demonic claws obscuring the sun, as if trying to cover the floating lake. Black light flashed, leaving claw marks in the void.</p><p>These claw marks resembled spatial rifts, their power terrifying.</p><p>Faced with such demonic might, Fan Laomo and the others were terrified, their first reaction being to evade. The Qinghu Saint King also retreated, avoiding the brunt of the attack, but a look of doubt flashed in her eyes as she stared at the demonic body at the center of the claw shadows, a bad feeling rising within her.</p><p>The next moment, a ferocious expression appeared on the demonic body's face. It roared angrily, suddenly raising its right arm, demonic energy billowing, transforming into a demonic claw ten feet in size.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The black light flashing from the claw instantly appeared beside the grey cocoon.  Simultaneously, the Five Elements Crown emitted a five-colored spiritual light, striking the claw, dyeing it in various colors.  This multicolored claw aimed at the grey cocoon containing the Poison King and struck down fiercely!</p><p>The Poison King inside the cocoon was struggling, only managing to hold on thanks to the protection of the Huiguang Saint.  They hadn't expected the demonic body, not yet completely consumed by madness, to use a feint!</p><p>Once the cocoon shattered, and the demonic body devoured the Poison King's primordial spirit, even a 10% increase in its power would be unbearable for them.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, this was the last vestige of the demonic spirit's rationality, a desperate gamble.  It was devouring the demonic child it had created, allowing the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound to exploit the weakness, constantly battling the terrifying madness, finally succumbing.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King reacted swiftly, bowing again to Mingyue Yingying. Moonlight shone toward the cocoon, but the demonic claw was faster!</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The silver rings on the cocoon's surface shattered, exploding under the impact of the claw.</p><p>The Fahua True Wheel buzzed above, attempting to reform the silver rings.</p><p>But the claw had already struck the cocoon, a dull thud echoing.  A huge palm-shaped dent immediately appeared on the cocoon's surface, deeply indented.</p><p>The claw's five fingers curled inward, like five sharp blades piercing the cocoon, emitting a tearing sound.</p><p>At this critical moment, a shadowy black line suddenly appeared on the cocoon's surface—the sacred object of the Wan Du Mountain. The hairs on the Gu insect's body stood on end, its body tensed, its head showing a wide-open mouth, emitting a silent shriek, frantically spraying grey smoke.</p><p>Most other great cultivators present would have been defeated.</p><p>Thanks to the Poison King and the sacred object's desperate efforts, the cocoon gained some thickness, managing to withstand the claw until help arrived.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Moonlight enveloped the cocoon, flowing continuously towards the claw.</p><p>The Fahua True Wheel, obeying the Huiguang Saint's will, reformed the silver rings, continuing to protect the Poison King.</p><p>The demonic body winced, violently retracting its claw, its roar becoming completely distorted in the latter half.  The demonic spirit's rationality vanished completely in the roar.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Demonic energy and five-element spiritual light merged. The demonic body's form was terrifying, its demonic might three times stronger than before.</p><p>Seeing the demonic body's eyes filled with boundless madness, everyone felt a chill down their spines.</p><p>However, a look of delight appeared on the Qinghu Saint King's face. The ancient demon had lost its rationality, so even with its increased strength, it was just brute force, easily manipulated. At least delaying it shouldn't be a problem.</p><p>She immediately transmitted a message to everyone, informing them of the situation and reorganizing the formation to confront the demonic body.</p><p>...</p><p>Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>The figure of the incarnation disappeared into the Five Elements Divine Prohibition.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to leave the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect once the Huiguang Saint began repairing the Demon Sealing Stake and the battle reached a stalemate, as the Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't be able to multitask.</p><p>On the other hand, with the loss of the treasure that suppressed and sealed it, the Five Elements' cyclical generation was broken, and the conflict between the Five Elements Divine Prohibitions intensified sharply. As time passed, the conflict became more and more violent, the repercussions spreading outwards, triggering and collapsing other formations.  It can be said that the entire Di Shou Mountain was in chaos, heading towards destruction.</p><p>The chaotic energy fluctuations were the perfect camouflage.  The Nascent Soul cultivator's attention was completely absorbed by the demonic body, leaving this area unguarded.  Unexpectedly, others had a similar idea, and they set their sights on him!</p><p>His avatar entered the Seven Mansions Sword Formation, intending to check for any hidden marks left by others. Suddenly, he sensed something amiss.  This was thanks to the golden sword he had previously obtained.  From it, Qin Sang had learned the "Seven Mansions Sword Formation" from the Jinxiang Palace's legacy. While he couldn't yet control the formation, he understood its structure intimately.  Even with the chaotic state within the formation, his perception of its shifts, particularly the surrounding energy, was extremely acute.</p><p>Entering the formation, his avatar sensed something behind him—he was being followed!  What startled him was the extreme subtlety of the pursuer's aura.  The person was so close, and the avatar only just noticed. If he hadn't been so sensitive to the formation's internal energy, he might have been caught completely off guard!</p><p>Both the avatar and Qin Sang's main body changed expression.  Wings of light spread, and the main body transformed into a bolt of lightning, leaving behind an angry snort.  The avatar, without hesitation, eyes flashing white, unleashed a blast of Ice Soul Divine Light behind him. Four Serpent Seals rose, but the serpents didn't attack. Instead, they circled the avatar as he charged towards a sword star within the formation.</p><p>In the Seven Mansions Sword Formation, each sword star is a node of sword intent.  While Qin Sang couldn't control the entire formation, he could manipulate the pure sword intent within a specific star, thus drawing on a small portion of the formation's power.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The avatar merged with the serpents, moving like lightning.  Simultaneously, a surprised gasp echoed behind the avatar.  Undulations appeared in the void, revealing a figure that rapidly split into three: Su Zinan in the center, flanked by Lao Wu and Yan Shan.</p><p>"Su Zinan!"</p><p>Qin Sang erupted in fury.  It was him! He hadn't let the avatar flee immediately, opting to enter the formation and remain near his main body, precisely to guard against this situation.  He kept the avatar on high alert, ready with spiritual treasures and divine light.</p><p>The Hui Guang Saint had made all promises and transactions above board to reassure everyone. Outside of the Di Shou Mountain, countless eyes watched. The avatar, armed with spiritual treasures, was strong; ordinary individuals posed no threat, but Su Zinan was an exception.  Qin Sang hadn't forgotten that since the Nascent Soul cultivator appeared, Su Zinan had vanished, evading even the Hui Guang Saint. Naturally, he had to be wary of this demon seizing the opportunity.</p><p>However, Qin Sang thought it unlikely Su Zinan would dare act under the Nascent Soul cultivator's nose, certainly not this soon, before the battle had reached a stalemate.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this demon was incredibly bold and decisive.  Apparently, the lure of the Five Elements Pill was too great, prompting Su Zinan to take this enormous risk.</p><p>Repeatedly targeted by Su Zinan, even Qin Sang was burning with rage, already intent on killing him, but protecting his avatar and the Five Elements Pill was paramount.  Qin Sang had witnessed Su Zinan's strength before. Regardless of his own abilities, the demonic banner that controlled two Grand Cultivators alone qualified it as the number one demonic artifact below Nascent Soul level.  Mo Xingdao, with his late-stage Yuan Ying puppet, hadn't fared well against Su Zinan.</p><p>Faced with such an opponent, the avatar's first reaction wasn't counterattack, but to use the sword star to protect himself.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light charged forth, its blinding radiance carrying a strange chilling aura.  Su Zinan pointed, a thumb-sized black ruler flying from his hand, expanding into a giant ruler that split into multiple forms.</p><p>With a "boom," the ruler shadows seemed to form an invisible barrier. The chilling aura was momentarily checked, the Ice Soul Divine Light slowing for a fraction of a second before continuing its fierce attack.</p><p>But Su Zinan had no intention of a direct confrontation.  Lao Wu and Yan Shan had already circled around the divine light, rushing towards the avatar.</p><p>Being discovered was unexpected, catching Su Zinan off guard.  His Heart-Phase Yin-遁符 could deceive even Nascent Soul cultivators, but it had failed here.</p><p>Su Zinan's body glowed with blood light. His main body suddenly became a blood shadow, instantly frozen by the Ice Soul Divine Light. His true form materialized in front of the shadow, charging forward without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang's decisiveness saved the avatar.</p><p>In a flash, the avatar merged with the nearest sword star, his figure swallowed by the bright sword light.  Meanwhile, the demonic souls of Lao Wu and Yan Shan were already in pursuit.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Cold light erupted from the sword star, the serpent roaring, its long tail lashing out at the two demonic souls.  Simultaneously, the sword formation's power around the sword star converged, forming a barrier of sword intent.</p><p>Lao Wu raised his demonic halberd, while Yan Shan's demonic soul threw a drop of spiritual water—the Yiyuan Heavy Water, a treasure he had refined for years.</p><p>Though the Four Serpent Seals were powerful, they were no match for the two Grand Cultivators' demonic souls.  The serpents were forced back.</p><p>By then, Su Zinan's main body had arrived, glancing at the sword star, he wielded his demonic banner, joining the demonic souls in a three-pronged attack.  Blood waves surged between them, creating a massive blood formation.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>The blood formation had just formed when a heavenly thunderbolt struck down.</p>
