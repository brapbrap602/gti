<h1>Chapter 1162: The Portrait</h1><p>"Sect Master."</p><p>The words slipped out, and both of them were momentarily stunned.</p><p>Simultaneously, their gazes turned to the portrait hanging on the wall of the grand hall.</p><p>The painting depicted only a figure's back. The person stood with hands clasped behind, as if wielding a sword against an enemy. Sword energy cascaded like a waterfall, exuding an extraordinary aura.</p><p>On his thumb was a conspicuous iron ring.</p><p>The person in the portrait was none other than the legendary founding ancestor of the Demonic Flame Sect. Even Mei Gu had never seen the ancestor's true face and could only imagine his appearance, thus painting a back view to be enshrined here.</p><p>"The Sect Master... I wonder where he is now, and if he is well..." Mei Gu's voice was soft and melancholic.</p><p>Zhao Shanran sighed, "The Sect Master hasn't shown himself for so long. He's probably already... Even if he's still alive, he must have forgotten all about us. Back then, he merely gathered a few wandering cultivators on a whim to form this sect. We've never even seen his true face. It's clear what his attitude toward us must be."</p><p>"Junior Brother, do not be disrespectful!" Mei Gu's brows furrowed, and she scolded him harshly without holding back. "You and I were once wandering cultivators, living day to day with little hope of reaching Foundation Establishment. It was the Sect Master who passed down cultivation techniques and elixirs, guiding us to successfully establish our foundations. He also founded this sect here, setting up a top-tier formation, giving us a place to stand in the cultivation world. During the chaos of the Sin Abyss, it was only thanks to the artifacts and elixirs left by the Sect Master that we were able to counter-kill that Sin Abyss cultivator and obtain the Soul-Tempering Pill. This kindness is akin to rebirth. Have you forgotten all of that?"</p><p>Mei Gu was furious.</p><p>Zhao Shanran was startled and quickly apologized, "This junior brother spoke out of turn. Please calm your anger, Senior Sister."</p><p>"Go and apologize to the Sect Master. Let this be the last time!" Mei Gu waved her hand dismissively as she watched Zhao Shanran apologize. "Junior Brother, you may leave now. Make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. I will send word to a few friends to help keep an eye on things. As long as you don't leave the sect grounds lightly, there's no need to worry too much. Even if Junior Brother Lu has formed his Golden Core, his strength won't be overwhelming. The Dark Spring Sect wouldn't dare to directly attack our mountain-protecting formation."</p><p>As she watched Zhao Shanran leave, Mei Gu let out a faint sigh.</p><p>Although everything she said was true, the Sect Master had burdened her with heavy responsibilities while he himself had become an absentee leader, neglecting the sect. How could Mei Gu not feel resentment in her heart?</p><p>But for the sake of maintaining unity and morale within the sect, she had to uphold righteousness and would never allow anyone to openly criticize the Sect Master.</p><p>Mei Gu closed the grand hall and headed toward her own cave abode.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang quietly appeared in the grand hall, admiring his own portrait.</p><p>These four individuals had been carefully selected by the Robed Daoist from among wandering cultivators, each possessing exceptional talent. However, Qin Sang hadn't expected that two of them would successfully form their Golden Cores.</p><p>This was also the first time he had heard of the Soul-Tempering Pill, likely an elixir used by Sin Abyss cultivators to aid in Golden Core formation.</p><p>In times of chaos, some people could turn misfortune into fortune.</p><p>With Qin Sang's discerning eyes, he could naturally see the resentment in Mei Gu and Zhao Shanran's hearts. However, this was only human nature. What mattered most was their true character.</p><p>Since he had nothing else to do, Qin Sang decided to observe a little longer.</p><p>He already had a plan in mind.</p><p>He needed to balance matters in the demon realm and couldn't afford to split his attention.</p><p>The reputation of the Green Sun Demon Sect's leader was at its peak, and he was not an easy opponent. Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to resort to extreme measures, lest he make an enemy of him.</p><p>Absorbing the Ancestral Sacred Flame would also be impossible to conceal as it had been last time.</p><p>To know your enemy and yourself is the key to victory in a hundred battles. It would be best to first understand the Green Sun Demon Sect's situation before paying a visit to its leader. Since the Demonic Flame Sect had pledged allegiance to the Green Sun Demon Sect, Mei Gu would have an easier time contacting its cultivators and gathering information.</p><p>...</p><p>After receiving the orders, the Demonic Flame Sect began preparations in earnest.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>The sound of rushing wind echoed as several figures descended before the Flaming Mountain.</p><p>Leading them was a Daoist with the appearance of an old man but the complexion of a childâ€”the leader of the Dark Spring Sect. Beside him stood a hooded cultivator.</p><p>"This isn't my first time visiting, but every time I see your sect's mountain-protecting formation, it never fails to awe me," the Dark Spring Sect leader said as he sent a command talisman into the formation, his eyes filled with fervor.</p><p>The hooded figure spoke leisurely, "As long as you help me eliminate those two, the Demonic Flame Sect will be under our control, and I will naturally abide by our agreement."</p><p>As he spoke, the mist churned, revealing a path that led straight to the mountain peak. From afar, Mei Gu's voice echoed, "Sect Leader Dong, forgive me for not coming to greet you in person."</p><p>"It is I who have come unannounced!" Sect Leader Dong replied loudly.</p><p>Then he whispered, "Fellow Daoist Lu, Elder Wu, follow me. The rest of you, wait outside."</p><p>The hooded figure and a burly man followed Sect Leader Dong into the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>At the mountain peak.</p><p>Mei Gu personally led her disciples to welcome them.</p><p>"Sect Leader Dong, Fellow Daoist Wu..." Mei Gu stepped forward, greeting them one by one. Then her gaze shifted to the hooded figure, and she asked with a smile, "And who might this fellow Daoist be?"</p><p>"He is an old friend of mine. However, he also has deep ties to your sect..." Before Sect Leader Dong could finish.</p><p>The hooded figure suddenly walked toward the Sect Master's grand hall without a word.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>Zhao Shanran and the disciples of the Demonic Flame Sect were enraged, blocking the hooded figure and drawing their swords.</p><p>Mei Gu's expression turned cold as she said icily, "Sect Leader Dong, your friend seems to lack manners! Or do you think that with three Golden Core cultivators, you can act recklessly within our formation?"</p><p>Sect Leader Dong smiled in response.</p><p>The hooded figure snorted coldly and abruptly removed his hood.</p><p>Upon seeing the hooded figure's true face, the disciples of the Demonic Flame Sect gasped in shock.</p><p>"Lu Xing pays respects to his master. How dare you block me?" Lu Xing roared, his aura as a Golden Core expert fully revealed.</p><p>The disciples of the Demonic Flame Sect paled and were forced to retreat under Lu Xing's pressure.</p><p>Zhao Shanran, who harbored deep hatred for him, cursed angrily, "So it's you, you heartless traitor! You coveted wealth, harmed your fellow disciples, and still have the audacity to return."</p><p>"A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to bark in front of me," Lu Xing said with disdain. "What evidence do you have? I could just as easily say that you killed Junior Brother Hongye for the Soul-Tempering Pill and framed me to cover your tracks. Fortunately, I was vigilant enough to escape your clutches."</p><p>Sect Leader Dong, seizing the moment, stepped forward to mediate, "The rights and wrongs of the past are difficult to untangle. Only those involved know the truth. It's a pity that fellow disciples have turned against each other. However, Fellow Daoist Lu has never forgotten the nurturing grace of his sect. Not long ago, he personally went to the Green Sun Demon Sect to request that the Demonic Flame Sect's tribute be halved. This shows his sincerity. I believe this at least entitles him to pay respects to his master, doesn't it?"</p><p>Lu Xing's anger turned to a smile as he said kindly, "I watched all of you grow up. How could I bear to see you sent to your deaths?"</p><p>At these words, Zhao Shanran's expression changed drastically.</p><p>With a few words, Sect Leader Dong and Lu Xing had muddied the waters of the past and then flaunted their supposed benevolence, revealing their malicious intentions.</p><p>Mei Gu remained composed and was about to speak.</p><p>Suddenly, the doors of the Sect Master's grand hall opened on their own, and a calm voice echoed from within.</p><p>"This old man doesn't recall ever taking you as a disciple."</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Catching up on yesterday and the day before. There will be more later, though it might be a bit late.</p>
