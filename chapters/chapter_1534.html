<h1>Chapter 1525: Living Beings (4k)</h1><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>After meeting Mu Yifeng, Qin Sang spent a month traveling and visiting old friends.</p><p>He mostly stayed in Xiao Han region.</p><p>It was like retracing half his cultivation journey.</p><p>Having reached the Yuan Ying stage, Qin Sang’s temperament wouldn't be greatly affected by this journey. His purpose was simply to see things again and reminisce.</p><p>Going to the Central Plains, he didn't know when he would return.</p><p>After his travels, Qin Sang finally arrived at Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Unable to return to the Seven Kills Hall, he could only pay his respects at the grave of Elder Qingzhu, remembering his last words.</p><p>Inside the wooden pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang placed four wine cups on the table.</p><p>He tried to conserve, but his treasured peach blossom wine was nearly gone.  This wine was carefully brewed by Senior Sister Qingjun, sweet and refreshing, far superior to others.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't brew it, nor did he want to learn.</p><p>He raised his cup.</p><p>One cup to honor Qingzhu.</p><p>Two cups in tribute to his senior sister and Bai.</p><p>…</p><p>Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>A crowd gathered before the restricted area.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, Shangguan Li Feng, Madam Mei, Zhao Ying, and other renowned Golden Core cultivators were all present.</p><p>"Senior Brother, what important matter does the Master want to announce? Did he bring back some treasure from the North Sea?" Zhao Ying whispered to Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Zhao Ying had the least interaction with Qin Sang, her previous understanding limited to rumors, making her both respect and fear him.</p><p>After Qingjun ascended, she joined Green Sheep Temple. Initially worried about being ostracized, she found the temple to be harmonious and without infighting for power, making her feel a true sense of belonging.</p><p>"Master Tan has been handling the sect's affairs. If there's a major event within the temple, he should know best.  Where is he?"</p><p>Madam Mei interjected, looking around, unable to find Tan Yi En.</p><p>"Sister, you just came back, you don't know yet?"</p><p>Bai Hanqiu said enviously, "Brother Tan has prospered. Elder Tan and the Master reunited in the North Sea and returned together.  Furthermore, Elder Tan is now a Yuan Ying cultivator, and the Master has appointed him as the Great Elder of Green Sheep Temple."</p><p>"Yuan Ying!"</p><p>Madam Mei was overjoyed.</p><p>The stronger Green Sheep Temple became, the more its disciples would benefit.</p><p>Jingyu was close to Green Sheep Temple, but more as a guest elder.</p><p>Green Sheep Temple was still in its early stages, with only a temple master, no elders.</p><p>Tan Hao was the first.</p><p>After the initial joy, Madam Mei remembered something and chuckled, "Brother Tan will probably not be able to continue his carefree life, will he? Before, I was very envious of how he could avoid the hardships of cultivation."</p><p>Bai Hanqiu shrugged, just about to speak, when the restricted area was filled with swirling mist, parting to reveal a small path. Qin Sang's voice emerged, summoning Li Yu Fu and the others to enter.</p><p>Everyone's expressions turned serious and respectful, their eyes fixed ahead as they walked into the restricted area without looking around.</p><p>Qin Sang had just returned from Green Sheep Temple's spiritual veins, planting the roots of the Myriad Spirit Fruit tree, setting up restrictions, and carefully tending to it.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the others bowed together.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, motioning for them to rise, then gestured toward Tan Hao who was sitting beside him, saying,  "From now on, Brother Tan will be the Great Elder of Green Sheep Temple.  Seeing Elder Tan is the same as seeing me."</p><p>Tan Yi En stood behind Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure how the father and son interacted.</p><p>He only knew that Tan Yi En remained his usual self, while Tan Hao looked helpless.</p><p>"Disciples obey! Greetings, Elder Tan!"</p><p>After bowing, Li Yu Fu and the others dared to steal a glance at Tan Hao.</p><p>He was tall and strong, with a noble bearing.</p><p>They had all heard from Tan Yi En about the story between Qin Sang and Tan Hao, knowing him to be someone of great loyalty and righteousness, a true hero, which inspired their respect.</p><p>Tan Hao returned the bow, looking at the outstanding younger generation, secretly nodding in admiration. He praised Qin Sang not only for his rapid cultivation progress, but also for his ability to establish a sect.</p><p>After introducing Tan Hao, Qin Sang announced two more momentous events: the relocation of the temple and the passing of the Master's position to Li Yu Fu.</p><p>He had originally wanted the most powerful Tan Hao to take the helm, but Tan Hao firmly refused.</p><p>One shocking announcement after another left the disciples stunned and speechless, unable to believe their ears, taking a long time to slowly digest the news.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't give them time to react, having already planned the arrangements for the sect, issuing orders one after another in an orderly manner.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned Li Yu Fu and the others individually.</p><p>Li Yu Fu accepted the responsibility of temple master, but requested to remain in the Northern Star region.</p><p>Although he longed for a wider world, he understood that cultivation was the foundation, planning to continue his rigorous training until reaching the peak of the Golden Core stage, then confronting the Yuan Ying bottleneck before seeking opportunities in the North Sea.</p><p>Another reason was that the situation in the North Sea was extremely complex and the struggles were fierce, unlike the Northern Star region.</p><p>Compared to major powers like Xuan Tiangong, Qing Yang Guan is still quite weak. Tan Hao needs to stay in Beihai to protect it, even Jing Yu frequently lends a hand.</p><p>Bei Chen is Qing Yang Guan's rear base, and it needs a high-ranking individual to oversee it. Li Yu Fu is the perfect candidate.</p><p>The second is Mei Gu.</p><p>She immediately requested to go to Beihai with Qin Sang.</p><p>Previously, she was bound by her responsibilities to Mo Yan Men.</p><p>After Qin Sang's return, Mei Gu shed her burdens and finally followed her heart, traveling whenever possible without hindering her cultivation.  She has explored almost all of Bei Chen, experiencing both good fortune and danger.</p><p>Hearing that the three regions of Beihai are far grander and more exciting than Bei Chen, Mei Gu's eyes lit up; she was eager to go.</p><p>If Qin Sang offered to take her to Zhongzhou, Mei Gu would have accepted without hesitation.</p><p>The third is Shangguan Li Feng.</p><p>His decision mirrored Mei Gu's.</p><p>However, his goal was to exchange swordsmanship with others and witness more refined techniques.</p><p>He had previously neglected his cultivation due to his focus on bladed weapons and the art of killing, nearly failing to form his Golden Core and facing premature death. After obtaining the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture," Shangguan Li Feng became completely engrossed, forgetting his past mistakes.</p><p>He confessed to Qin Sang that he had not broken through to the mid-Golden Core stage, and his chances of forming a Nascent Soul were slim. He desired to focus solely on the sword path and achieve something meaningful.</p><p>If he could one day cultivate a successor to carry on the legacy of Elder Qingzhu, he would consider his life well-spent.</p><p>Then there's Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>In recent years, she has enjoyed a happy marriage with children—a son and two daughters—and witnessed many younger disciples surpass her in cultivation.  While she is admiring, she doesn't regret it.</p><p>She also doesn't want to leave her family and travel to Beihai.</p><p>She is content to spend her remaining years here.</p><p>As for Tan Yi En, Qin Sang knew without asking that he would go to Beihai.</p><p>Tan Yi En's lifelong ambition has shifted from establishing Bei Chen's top sect to establishing Beihai's top sect. He is eager and determined.</p><p>After Tan Yi En's departure, Bai Hanqiu will take over his administrative duties.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's eldest daughter possesses a talent for cultivation and is around the same age as Qin Nian Sui.  She had previously asked Qin Sang to consider arranging a marriage between them.</p><p>Qin Sang neither agreed nor disagreed.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang took out a jade stone, carved it into two pendants, and using demonic fire, refined them into protective amulets, giving them to Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Finally, there's Zhao Ying.</p><p>She inherited Qing Jun's lineage, and Qin Sang treats her as his own junior.</p><p>Zhao Ying decided to remain in Bei Chen for now, assisting Li Yu Fu, and then proceed to Beihai when the time is right.</p><p>"Have you ever seen these two items?"</p><p>Qin Sang produced the Yang Puppet Crystal and Gui General's puppet.</p><p>He had studied them for a long time without any leads.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qing Jun was no longer around.</p><p>Zhao Ying, having learned from Qing Jun, might have heard of them.</p><p>Zhao Ying took the crystal and puppet, examining them closely. Her brow furrowed deeper and deeper until, apologizing, she sat down, closed her eyes, and used secret techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently without a word.</p><p>After two hours, Zhao Ying awoke and pointed to the puppet:  "Master, I have never seen this kind of puppet before.  However, I have a feeling it is similar in some way to Senior Qing Jun's Qingluan puppet.  It's created through the imprint of its owner; upon the owner's death, it becomes completely dormant and loses all its power, unable to be controlled by outsiders."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully.  He suspected it was the Gui General's personal puppet, a highly mysterious and refined type.</p><p>After a pause, seeing Qin Sang silent, Zhao Ying continued: "I believe Senior Qing Jun mentioned this type of crystal once.  She only briefly mentioned it, possibly saying it was a treasure used by ancient cultivators to create puppets, a lost technique.  I don't know its function.  This puppet doesn't seem to have fully absorbed the Yin Puppet Crystal.  I'm sorry, but I can't figure out how to safely separate it."</p><p>Qin Sang did not rebuke her, instead showing approval.</p><p>The crystal could enhance Yuan Ying-level puppets, and Zhao Ying's observations were already quite insightful.</p><p>...</p><p>In the following days, Qing Yang Guan appeared calm, but beneath the surface, preparations for the relocation were underway.</p><p>Qin Sang, having learned from the Xuan Tian Palace incident, made adjustments to Qing Yang Guan, but understood that lasting success wasn't guaranteed.  The future of Qing Yang Guan rested in the hands of its disciples.</p><p>Besides the Wan Ling fruit tree, he left three things behind:</p><p>First, a map of the Central Plains Sea.</p><p>Second, the formula for Zhen Ling incense.</p><p>He established a rule: only the Abbot and the First Elder of Qing Yang Guan would have access to these two items.  The Guan would need to focus on collecting the herbs needed for the incense formula.</p><p>Third, the Ji Yuan technique.</p><p>In the North Sea, this secret technique was considered equivalent to immortal arts.  Mastery of this technique, and the creation of pseudo-spiritual treasures, would allow late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators to reach a new level of power.  If its existence were to become public, the entire North Sea would be thrown into chaos.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace also knew this technique; it was not a secret. For various reasons, Qin Sang decided to leave it behind, but he placed a divine sense restriction on it. Only disciples who reached the divine sense embodiment stage would be able to access it.</p><p>With these three things, Qing Yang Guan's foundation would rival that of other sects.  However, Qing Yang Guan was still too weak and likely wouldn’t benefit from them for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>Six months later.</p><p>Qin Sang personally attended the Beichen Alliance Conference for the last time. News of Qing Yang Guan’s new Yuan Ying elder had spread like wildfire among the various sects. Upon seeing Qin Sang, many approached him to offer their congratulations.  He didn’t concern himself with their true intentions, publicly announcing his intention to enter seclusion to strive for late-stage Yuan Ying cultivation.</p><p>Three days after the conference.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao, accompanied by Mu Yifeng and the first group of elite disciples selected from Qing Yang Guan, secretly flew to the southernmost part of the Beichen region to rendezvous with Jing Yu and the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea demons.</p><p>The group was small, for it was their first expedition. Using the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle, and making two stops at shelters along the way, they navigated the storm belt without incident.</p><p>Entering a new world, the disciples were awestruck and excited.  However, after several days of flight with Qin Sang, they grew bored; it seemed little different from the Beichen region.</p><p>While circumventing the demon realm, Jing Yu, after learning the location of the Cui Ming Islands, entered the demon realm for exploration on her own.</p><p>The rest continued without stopping, smoothly reaching the Cui Ming Islands.</p><p>Above Qing Yang Island.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared, surveying the area below.  During his absence, the island’s protective formation remained intact, untouched.</p><p>Seeing the vast expanse of sea under Qing Yang Guan's control, and learning of the other islands, including Nine Precepts Island, which Qin Sang controlled, Tan Yi'en and the others were ecstatic, their hopes for the future soaring.</p><p>They had built Qing Yang Guan from nothing. Establishing a branch Guan was therefore easy for them.  Using past experience and lessons learned, they quickly constructed Qing Yang Island.  During this time, they finally heard from outsiders about their Abbot's impressive achievements.</p><p>In just twenty years, he had shaken up the Boundless Sea, his name echoing across the North Sea.  Their reverence for Qin Sang had reached an unparalleled level.</p><p>Meanwhile, news of Qin Sang establishing a sect in the Boundless Sea spread rapidly, attracting attention from all sides.</p><p>The situation in the North Sea was more complex than in the Beichen region.  The Boundless Sea was vast, with thriving merchant guilds. Unlike those in Beichen, many of these guilds were not controlled by sects; they were powerful entities in their own right.  Qing Yang Guan had to learn how to deal with them.</p><p>There were many other considerations.  But Qin Sang’s notorious reputation simplified things considerably.  Especially after his public, unharmed slaying of the Ghost General years prior, all doubt was dispelled, and any restless demons disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, representing Qing Yang Guan, frequently interacted with various parties, and received respectful treatment regardless of their cultivation level.</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Qing Yang Guan was officially established!</p><p>Tong Lingyu emerged from seclusion, leading the heads of various branches to offer their congratulations.  Additionally, renowned Yuan Ying cultivators such as Feng Shangshi, Mu Guzhu, and Yinquan Daoist from the Xuan Yue region, as well as friends Qin Sang had made in the Star Sand Islands, traveled great distances to celebrate.</p><p>Naturally, the Boundless Sea's forces were present.  The surviving demons dared not attend in person; after the Ghost General's death, Qin Sang had contacted Xuan Tian Palace to hunt down the remaining members, leaving them fearful and prompting them to send gifts as a sign of goodwill.</p><p>The celebration's grandeur rivaled that of a Great Cultivator's ascension ceremony.  One after another, influential figures who could command the wind and rain in the Beichen region arrived; the North Sea had so many!</p><p>Tan Yi'en and the others’ slight pride was shattered, realizing the enormity of their task.</p><p>No demon kings from the demon realm attended.  Jing Yu, after her extensive travels, returned.</p><p>Qin Sang reminded her that the Nine-Headed Great Saint likely had ties to the Feather King, and knowing their relationship, they needed to be wary of its potential attack.</p><p>Jing Yu didn't visit the Nine-Headed Great Saint, but observed it from afar.  This demon, a cultivated nine-headed serpent, surprisingly, had not yet transformed into human form, remaining in its original form. Its movements caused clouds and mist to billow, creating a spectacular sight.  Qin Sang had deliberately refrained from letting Qing Yang Guan monopolize the sea chart, precisely to guard against this demon.</p><p>After the ceremony.</p><p>Shi Xue, Liuli, and others remained on Qing Yang Island; Liuli's tribulation was approaching.</p>
