<h1>Chapter 1734: The Taiyi Star Chariot</h1><p>This is followed by a lengthy passage detailing Bao Gu's situation at the time.</p><p>Essentially, the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea were protected by an invisible barrier, isolating them from the outside world, leaving them unaware of what lay beyond.</p><p>Bao Gu, upon leaving the Canglang Sea, might have travelled to Central State, learning about Mount Daiyu and the ascension paths forged by cultivators throughout history, but she was unaware of this before her departure.</p><p>…</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang collected her thoughts and asked Bao Zhengnan if anyone had seen Bao Gu since then.  She received a negative answer.</p><p>Bao Gu cared deeply for the world. If she had discovered ascension secrets in Central State, she would have relayed them back to the Canglang Sea, but she never returned.  This suggests the invisible barrier's one-way restriction was designed to prevent outsiders from entering, but also to keep the indigenous cultivators from leaving.</p><p>Bao Gu may have foreseen this before her departure, thus making these arrangements.</p><p>Qin Sang continued reading.</p><p>It turned out that the Witch Clan had an ancient legend: that upon reaching the Transcendence stage, cultivators would feel a connection with the ascension gate. Following this connection would lead to ascension, but the journey was arduous and required caution.</p><p>Furthermore, the Witch Clan's legends mentioned Gui Xu!</p><p>This shows that Gui Xu existed in ancient times, but it's unclear if any ferocious beasts roamed there then.</p><p>Next came the arrangements Bao Gu made before her departure.</p><p>After reading this, Qin Sang was both shocked and delighted, deeply admiring this ancestor from thousands of years ago.</p><p>The Four Saints of the Canglang Sea truly lived up to their name!</p><p>Bao Gu, having reached the Transcendence stage, had the ability to ascend, but instead of seeking her own transcendence, she sought a way out for her people.</p><p>Bao Gu referred to the invisible barrier as a boundary. To find a way out, the first step was to break through the boundary and find a way to connect the inside and the outside.</p><p>What goes out must be able to come in.</p><p>Unfortunately, fate intervened. During the Four Saints Palace's experiments with various secret techniques and treasures, an incident occurred in the Seven Killing Hall, nearly unleashing a demon lord. Three of the Four Saints sacrificed themselves to seal the demon.</p><p>Although Bao Gu survived, she suffered severe injuries.</p><p>Worse, to complete the demon seal, Bao Gu had to overdraw her own essence, drastically shortening her lifespan.</p><p>Even after her injuries healed, the fundamental depletion could not be repaired.  She had only a century or two left to live—for a Transcendence-stage cultivator, that might be just the time it takes for a single retreat.</p><p>The resources in the lower realms were scarce; the Canglang Sea, the Demon Sea, and the Seven Killing Hall did not possess any elixirs that could restore her life force. Only ascension to the upper realms offered a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Despite her own precarious situation, Bao Gu did not forget her former ambition, but she was powerless, leaving the affairs of the lower realm to her successors.</p><p>After reading the jade slip, Qin Sang's gaze returned to the landscape screen, staring at the full moon in the painting.</p><p>Bao Gu left behind a treasure for future generations, called the Taiyi Star Chariot!</p><p>This treasure was a celestial chariot obtained by the Four Saints from the Seven Killing Hall. Cultivators riding the Taiyi Star Chariot could potentially traverse the external boundary and freely enter and exit.</p><p>Now that the invisible barrier was gone, in Qin Sang's eyes, the Taiyi Star Chariot's importance had increased rather than decreased!</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chariot was a broken treasure. The Four Saints had racked their brains trying to repair it, but before they could, the incident occurred, forcing Bao Gu to ascend.</p><p>Being a broken treasure, it was hard to say how powerful the Taiyi Star Chariot originally was.</p><p>The Four Saints deduced that riding the Taiyi Star Chariot would be like being in the Broad Cold Heavenly Palace, surrounded by starlight and moonlight, traveling through the sky on the moon, appearing and disappearing with the moon's phases.</p><p>Its speed might not be particularly fast, but it possessed concealment and protection capabilities!</p><p>Because of this, Bao Gu left other instructions: whether her ascension succeeded or failed, she would try to leave a special mark in Gui Xu that could resonate with the Taiyi Star Chariot's restrictions.  Future generations, if they could repair the Taiyi Star Chariot, could use it to enter Gui Xu and search.</p><p>Using this treasure, finding the ascension gate would be much easier.</p><p>The full moon on the landscape screen was the Taiyi Star Chariot!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed after closing the book, recalling the ancestors who opened up the ascension path for this world. Bao Gu was a microcosm of them; they ventured into Gui Xu, even sacrificing themselves, leaving something behind to guide future generations.</p><p>"I wonder if Senior Bao Gu ever went to Central State, whether she knew of Mount Daiyu…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>But considering that Bao Gu had little life force remaining, even in the vast world, fundamental restorative elixirs wouldn't be readily available. Bao Gu likely didn't have time to travel in this world.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and the other two silently watched Qin Sang holding the jade slip, very curious about its contents, but since she didn’t let go of it, they didn’t dare to ask for it.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang snapped back to her senses, handing the jade slip to Bao Zhengnan, walking directly to the landscape screen, and extending her right hand to lightly touch the screen.</p><p>The screen was made of a soft, almost ethereal material – neither silk nor gauze, yet possessing a smooth, warm texture – a treasure in itself.  Qin Sang covered the full moon depicted on the screen with his hand, applying gentle pressure.  To everyone's astonishment, his hand sank completely into the painting, only his wrist remaining visible.  When he withdrew his hand, his palm held a luminous moon.</p><p>The landscape screen, now devoid of its moon, was bereft of its artistic essence.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes gleamed as he examined the Taiyi Star Chariot in his hand.  Its brilliant light flowed like water, gently caressing his fingers, shimmering brilliantly, as if a real moon had been plucked from the heavens.  At the moon's center, a small, exquisitely crafted chariot, seemingly carved from jade, was faintly visible.  "Chariot" hardly did it justice; it resembled a miniature, ornate divine palace, sadly marred by numerous cracks and damage that detracted from its majesty.</p><p>This was the true form of the Taiyi Star Chariot: small and exquisite, yet possessing otherworldly capabilities when activated.  Its light flickered, causing the chariot to appear and disappear, seemingly shifting between reality and illusion.  Even without spiritual sense, its considerable damage was evident.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the artifact's imperfections, recalling the contents of Bao Gu's writings.  The Four Saints had failed to fully restore it, but had left invaluable insights.  However, according to Bao Gu, complete restoration was practically impossible.  They could only strive for partial repair, restoring some of its power for use.</p><p>The Bao siblings and Zhuo Ming, now aware of their ancestor’s writings, looked at the Taiyi Star Chariot in Qin Sang’s hand.  Despite their expectations, disappointment was palpable.  Their ancestor's legacy contained only this single treasure, and it was not an elixir or medicine that could aid cultivation breakthroughs.</p><p>More importantly, their ancestor had clearly stated that restoring the Taiyi Star Chariot required at least the cultivation of a Nascent Soul stage cultivator. Even then, wielding it would be incredibly difficult, perhaps even impossible, for a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, can you repair this treasure?" Bao Zhengnan asked.</p><p>Bao Gu had left her insights, but even in their time, they hadn't developed a reliable repair method. Only several hypotheses remained, requiring Qin Sang's verification.</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought before replying, "I possess some skill in artifact refinement, but this treasure is exceptionally profound. I need time to study it and gradually test the repair methods hypothesized by Senior Bao Gu.  Central Plains boasts numerous powerful cultivators and many undiscovered materials from foreign lands. I intend to take this treasure back to the Central Plains; the chances of successful repair will be higher. What do you think?"</p><p>The three exchanged glances.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan bowed, "Our ancestor stated that this treasure should be given to the Nascent Soul cultivator who opened the cave.  Furthermore, Daoist Qin has traveled far and wide, searching for a path forward for the cultivators of this world, aligning perfectly with our ancestor's wishes.  This treasure rightly belongs to you."</p><p>Qin Sang neither accepted nor refused the offer; he couldn't.  He reiterated his promise, "Regardless of future developments, I will not forget the Canglang Sea."</p><p>"We rely on Daoist Qin to lead the way!" Bao Zhengnan and the others bowed deeply, their expressions solemn.</p><p>The cave’s chairs and cushions were ordinary, but the landscape screen was specially crafted by Bao Gu to store and nurture the Taiyi Star Chariot.  Qin Sang took both the screen and the chariot, returning to his chambers in the Four Saints Palace.  The Bao siblings and Zhuo Ming remained behind, setting up powerful restrictions around Bao Gu’s cave, designating it a sacred site.</p><p>Secluding himself in his chambers, Qin Sang carefully examined the Taiyi Star Chariot.  His expertise in artifact refinement clearly indicated that restoration would be extremely difficult, a long-term project.</p><p>But he could afford to wait.  Achieving the Nascent Soul stage before eight hundred years old was rare.  His lifespan and tribulation were not immediate concerns, and the Jade Buddha protected him from the influence of Heavenly Demon Sounds.</p><p>If a second Ascension Platform couldn't be found, crossing the Gui Xu might be the only option.  The Taiyi Star Chariot possessed protective and concealing abilities; the Four Saints also speculated that it could traverse barriers.  These would prove invaluable in the Gui Xu, increasing survival chances and potentially allowing infiltration of the Gui Xu and the Daiyu Immortal Mountain for reconnaissance before making preparations.</p><p>Of course, the Taiyi Star Chariot remained unrepaired, its full power unknown.  Considering its origins, Qin Sang was confident.  The question was, to what extent could he restore it?</p><p>Thrilled by this unexpected treasure, Qin Sang immersed himself in its study, spending a full month in his chambers without interruption.  His attendants dared not disturb him, only guarding the door. Even Bao Zhengnan did not see him.  During that time, the Four Saints Palace was very active, inviting various factions to Tianxing Island at Qin Sang’s behest.</p><p>The invitation to the gathering was ostensibly open to all sects and schools, but in reality, attendance was limited to representatives from a select few.  Unlike the constantly warring lands of Beyu, Canglang Sea's prolonged conflicts forced sects of all sizes into alliances for mutual protection. The Four Sacred Palaces stood as the most powerful among them.</p><p>The traditional conflict between righteous and demonic cultivators had faded, or rather, been overshadowed by larger concerns.  All factions now largely acknowledged the Four Sacred Palaces' authority, resulting in a relatively tightly organized human alliance.</p><p>As the appointed day approached, it was time for them to depart.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan arrived at the quiet chamber's entrance, touched the restriction, and it dissipated.  He pushed open the door, his expression one of surprise.  Qin Sang sat cross-legged, a full moon suspended before them, yet their face was etched with fatigue.</p><p>"Engrossed in my work, I almost forgot the important matter…" Qin Sang shook their head slightly.</p><p>"There's still plenty of time, would you like to rest for a few days?" Bao Zhengnan asked with concern, casting a curious glance at the Taiyi Star Chart.  They had previously brought in all the Palace's alchemical texts; these legacies, of course, were passed down from the Four Saints. He wondered if Qin Sang had gleaned any insights.</p><p>"No need," Qin Sang replied, putting away the Taiyi Star Chart.  A beam of light enveloped their body, and the exhaustion vanished.</p><p>The next day,</p><p>On a vast, seemingly empty expanse of sea, barely perceptible ripples disturbed the surface.  Moments later, four figures appeared, flying at a moderate pace—Qin Sang and three others.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan pointed south.  "From here south, less than an hour will bring us to Tianxing Island."</p><p>This time estimate, of course, was based on their speed of travel.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed south, a sense of returning to familiar territory washing over them.  Remembering something, they asked, "Has there been any news on those old friends I asked you to find?"</p><p>Bao Xi answered, "I've tasked Palace disciples with the search. We should have leads soon. For human cultivators, as long as their origins are clear, tracing their whereabouts shouldn't be difficult. Finding the demonic beasts will be more troublesome. During the invasion of the Yaohai demons, many Canglang Sea demons were swayed, and there were even cases of spirit beasts turning on their masters. After repelling the Yaohai demons, large demonic beasts have become rare in Canglang Sea. Were the beasts you seek involved in an attack on you?"</p><p>Reflecting on Qin Sang's experiences in the Canglang Sea, it was a constant search for the Seven Killing Hall, or travel to it.  They had made few genuine connections.</p><p>Among humans, besides the Wang sisters, there was a disciple without a formal master-apprentice relationship but who was essentially a disciple—Bai Ying’er.</p><p>Among demonic beasts, there was the Double-Headed Jiao, their acquaintance spanning many years, and a certain degree of friendship with Yuan Zhu, abandoned by the Yaohai demons.</p><p>Coming here, Qin Sang naturally wanted to see these old friends.  However, nearly six hundred years had passed—would they even still be alive?</p><p>Thinking of the Wang sisters, as alike as twin lotuses yet so different in temperament, Qin Sang sighed softly.  Their tribulation to the Golden Core stage had been so arduous; who knows if any of them had achieved the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Opening their mouth to speak, Qin Sang paused, their expression shifting as they looked to their right.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and the others were surprised, only noticing after a moment that a cultivator was speeding towards them, also heading for Tianxing Island, and their aura was strong.</p><p>"From that direction… it might be the Lan Dou Sect's Sect Master…" Bao Zhengnan said.</p><p>"Let's go take a look," Qin Sang said.</p><p>The four subtly altered their course, and after a short distance, they saw a hawk-like spirit bird soaring in the sky ahead.  Its wings spanned over thirty feet, its back broad and flat, with several cultivators sitting or standing upon it.</p><p>The central figure, with white hair and beard, was Bai Lu, the current Lan Dou Sect Master, a Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator.</p><p>They saw each other from afar.</p><p>Bai Lu immediately led his group down to meet them.  They were all acquaintances, exchanging greetings.  Bai Lu's gaze then turned to Qin Sang, the only stranger. "This Daoist friend is...?"</p><p>The more Bai Lu looked, the more suspicious he became.  Qin Sang stood calmly among the three top experts of the Four Sacred Palaces, completely at ease.  The positioning of Bao Zhengnan and the others seemed to center around Qin Sang.</p><p>Bai Lu prided himself on his ability to judge people, yet he couldn't fathom this person.  This indicated that their cultivation was at least on par with his own.  He was certain he had never met this person before.</p><p>"Has another top expert emerged in the world, and been recruited by the Four Sacred Palaces?" Bai Lu mused to himself.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan glanced at Qin Sang, considering how to introduce them.</p><p>Qin Sang proactively bowed.  "My surname is Qin, I greet Sect Master Bai Lu."</p><p>Their gaze swept over those behind Bai Lu, noticing the absence of anyone who cultivated the Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique, and asked quizzically, "Why is the Yin-Yang branch's head not present?"</p><p>Bai Lu was slightly taken aback, then a glimmer of joy appeared in his eyes.  "Disciple Yang has recently made a breakthrough and is currently in seclusion.  Daoist Friend knows Disciple Yang?"</p><p>Yang?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  Could it be that Yang uncle?</p><p>(End)</p>
