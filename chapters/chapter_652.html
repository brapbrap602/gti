<h1>Chapter 644: Nature's Gift</h1><p>Chapter 644: Nature's Gift</p><p>The initial shock subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, "The Red Fire Gilded Metal truly has a powerful allure to them. Thankfully, I had a backup plan."</p><p>He wasn't reckless.  He'd scattered the Blood Winged Devil Bee larvae far away, precisely to guard against this.  If he attracted a powerful spirit insect, the self-destructing larvae would serve as his escape route.</p><p>The Red Fire Gilded Metal was far more important than chasing down an intruding enemy.</p><p>Spirit insects aren't very intelligent; they only make simple judgments.</p><p>Each spirit insect has a different temperament.  Before, Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure how effective the Red Fire Gilded Metal would be, as it only works when the insect is on the verge of metamorphosis.</p><p>Now it seems he underestimated its appeal.</p><p>The method proved viable, but what it would ultimately attract was beyond his control.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally cursed those who discovered the Myriad Chitin insect, wondering if the information was wrong or if there wasn't just one, but a whole nest in the cavern.</p><p>Usually, the Myriad Chitin elder wouldn't appear unless it sensed the Red Fire Gilded Metal.</p><p>This Myriad Chitin pursuing him was terrifying. It easily found the Flying Night Rakshasa's hiding place and possessed incredible combat power, far exceeding Qin Sang's expectations—likely a late third-stage insect.</p><p>Its attacks were untraceable; it seemed to have power-breaking abilities, only felt when it struck.</p><p>The Myriad Chitin was discovered decades ago.</p><p>Qin Sang assumed that even at its strongest, a Myriad Chitin would only be at the completion of its third metamorphosis. With him and the Flying Night Rakshasa, he thought they'd be safe.</p><p>Fortunately, he reacted quickly, luring it away by detonating the larvae. Otherwise, the Flying Night Rakshasa wouldn't have survived a third strike.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Flying Night Rakshasa. Seeing its wounds, he felt a chill. He produced a small vial containing earth-sha earth energy, allowing it to absorb the energy to heal.</p><p>Gazing far off towards the cavern entrance, Qin Sang's expression shifted.</p><p>He decided to leave, abandoning the Myriad Chitin.</p><p>With this insect present, the cavern was extremely dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang was no match for it.</p><p>Even if he found help and captured it, it wouldn't be useful.</p><p>The spirit insect control methods Qin Sang knew, whether the Imperial Spirit Sect's legacy or the Witch Clan's natal insect gu, required the cultivator's cultivation to surpass the insect.</p><p>The natal insect gu was impossible.</p><p>Using the Imperial Spirit Sect's method, controlling this Myriad Chitin would require waiting until its fourth metamorphosis and seizing the opportunity.</p><p>In other words, Qin Sang needed to reach the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>If this Myriad Chitin understood to consume but not refine the Red Fire Gilded Metal, absorbing its power during its fourth metamorphosis, maybe this trace of Red Fire Gilded Metal would alter its fate.</p><p>This was truly a case of fortune knocking at one's door.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was strange. He'd become a gift-bearer.</p><p>Would it thank nature for the gift?</p><p>Only a tiny amount of Red Fire Gilded Metal was needed to lure the Myriad Chitin, so Qin Sang's losses weren't significant. But this was a lesson: when using Red Fire Gilded Metal to lure insects, one could never be too cautious.</p><p>…</p><p>"Sixth one."</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of a poisonous swamp, massaging his temples wearily.</p><p>After leaving the Myriad Chitin cavern, Qin Sang had relentlessly gone to four more locations.</p><p>Now he was far more careful, first testing with lure-insect medicine, then using the Devil Bee larvae as bait, trying various methods before resorting to the Red Fire Gilded Metal.</p><p>During the luring, he and the Flying Night Rakshasa kept their distance and planned escape routes beforehand.</p><p>Qin Sang, painstakingly and over long distances, traveled through various wild lands, searching four places in vain. Each time he poured all his energy into it, only to come up empty, leaving him exhausted and weary.</p><p>However, this result was expected.</p><p>Spirit insects have extremely acute senses of danger and often migrate.  And with the rumors so widespread, many know about them, and they may have already been captured, especially those at the top of the Witch Insect List.</p><p>Qin Sang had the Red Fire Gilded Metal, but others might have their own unique insect-luring methods.</p><p>Finding a suitable spirit insect wasn't easy.</p><p>This swamp was the sixth location.  Legend said a Rainbow Ring Giant Earthworm lived inside.</p><p>The swamp was smaller than the Myriad Chitin wasteland. Multicolored poisonous mist floated in the air, appearing even more vibrant in the sunlight, bringing to mind the brightly colored hides of venomous insects and beasts.</p><p>In truth, the poisonous swamp's miasma is extremely potent. Deep within, even spiritual energy offers no protection; it's a death trap even Foundation Establishment cultivators wouldn't dare enter.</p><p>Strangely, the swamp harbors numerous herbs that neutralize all poisons.  Periodically, cultivators risk their lives to seek these remedies, though they remain near the edges, never venturing into the heart of the swamp.</p><p>This second-stage Rainbow Ring Giant Earthworm was discovered by these herb gatherers.  More than one person has witnessed it – even thirty years ago – making this sighting far more reliable than rumors.</p><p>The Rainbow Ring Giant Earthworm possesses the bloodline of ancient earthworms, thriving on poisonous fumes.  It releases a poisonous cloud and its entire body is highly venomous; most wouldn't even dare touch it.  The more vibrant and numerous its rings, the more deadly its poison.</p><p>It's a suitable choice as a soul-bound insect. After its third transformation, its cloud of poison becomes invisible and odorless, easily catching even a Foundation Establishment cultivator off-guard.  It's said that after its fourth transformation, the Rainbow Ring Giant Earthworm gains a rare, indestructible body – a powerful ability countless physical cultivators crave.</p><p>Of course, like other strange insects, it's incredibly difficult to cultivate.  Its venomous nature also makes it hard to capture, thus herb gatherers show little interest.</p><p>Qin Sang, prepared with anti-miasma artifacts, entered the swamp with Flying Night Rakshasa, stopping near the core.  He dared not go further, opting to lay a trap.</p><p>The miasma rendered most insect lures useless.  He released Blood Winged Devil Bee larvae, only to see them instantly corroded by the miasma without his protection.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang resorted to using his Red Fire Gilded paint.  He understood the Rainbow Ring Giant Earthworm's abilities; the earthworm is venomous, yet Flying Night Rakshasa is relatively resistant due to its body's refinement through Earth Fiend Qi. This time, even encountering a late third-stage Rainbow Ring Giant Earthworm wouldn't be as disastrous.</p><p>Still, Qin Sang remained cautious, wary of attracting other creatures besides the earthworm.</p><p>Oddly, the miasma-filled swamp surprisingly hosted many common plants, defying explanation.</p><p>Unable to use the Blood Winged Devil Bee larvae, Qin Sang applied Red Fire Gilded paint to the trees and plants across a wide area. He and Flying Night Rakshasa climbed into the treetops, patiently observing the bubbling swamp below.</p>
