<h1>    Ruins. Now, only sixteen had gathered by the stone monument.</p><p>Of course, it was possible that some people, such</h1><p>    as Scattered Immortal Yunqiong, had given up halfway through the trial and left the Ancient Ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang</p><p>    arrived and, upon finding Mu Yifeng and Yu Daiyue present, he approached them.</p><p>"Fellow-uncle Che and the</p><p>    others still haven't come out?" Qin Sang asked in a low voice.</p><p>Mu Yifeng shook his head, his gaze fixated on</p><p>    the west with a solemn expression. "After the change, Venerable Sikong ordered us to leave and wait, while he</p><p>    personally went to meet Fellow-uncle Che and the others."</p><p>The collapse accelerated, with some spatial rifts</p><p>    merging to form an enormous one, over a thousand feet wide. It resembled the gaping maw of a monster, ready to</p><p>    devour any intruder.</p><p>With space being torn apart, it presented an extremely bizarre sight. Some lava rivers</p><p>    suddenly stopped flowing, while in other areas, vast tracts of land and mountains were inverted, defying all logic.</p><p>    This phenomenon became more severe the closer one got to the four celestial peaks.</p><p>Yet, the Nascent Soul</p><p>    cultivators had still not emerged. Elder Dique and Daoist Xuanyu were unlikely to appear, but the other three had</p><p>    also not shown themselves.</p><p>Surely, all five Golden Cores couldn't have perished? Qin Sang thought to himself,</p><p>    gazing at the apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Losing five Golden Cores would be a major blow to the various sects. Even the</p><p>    Eight Righteous Paths had limited Nascent Soul cultivators in their ranks.</p><p>The Green Luan Sect had been dealt</p><p>    the worst blow of all, as their Sect Master was among those missing.</p><p>After waiting a while longer, the lava</p><p>    and Fire Spirit Beasts invaded in full force, drawing closer and closer to the stone monument. The Golden Core</p><p>    cultivators remained out of sight, and the others began to grow restless and anxious.</p><p>Just then, someone</p><p>    suddenly exclaimed, "Look there!" and pointed to the distance.</p><p>Upon straining their eyes, they saw three small</p><p>    lights flickering between the spatial rifts. The space was far from stable and was still in constant flux, with some</p><p>    rifts expanding or even drifting about.</p><p>The lights were moving cautiously among them, managing to avoid being</p><p>    devoured by the spatial rifts just in the nick of time. Though they were too far away to make out any details, it</p><p>    was still a thrilling sight.</p><p>Finally, the lights managed to emerge from the spatial rifts, only to be met by a</p><p>    horde of raging Fire Spirit Beasts.</p><p>Despite their numbers, the Fire Spirit Beasts were still relatively sparse</p><p>    compared to the vast expanse of the ruins. For Nascent Soul cultivators, they weren't a significant problem and were</p><p>    easily brushed aside.</p><p>Before long, three figures materialized before the others, revealing themselves as Che</p><p>    Yutao and his companions.</p><p>Venerable Sikong Muyue and Elder Du Yi looked fine, but Che Yutao appeared</p><p>    disheveled. There was a large gash on his left arm, where a substantial chunk of flesh had been torn away.</p><p>Che</p><p>    Yutao ignored his wound for now, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. His expression darkened, and he demanded,</p><p>    "Where's Daoist Xuanyu?"</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator's aura descended upon the others, leaving them breathless</p><p>    and feeling like mountains were pressing down on them. Horrified, a Foundation Establishment latter-stage cultivator</p><p>    forced out the words, "Reporting to Fellow-uncle Che, after the change, we have not seen the two Masters. They...</p><p>    they seem not to have come out yet..."</p><p>Che Yutao and his companions' faces changed drastically upon hearing</p><p>    this. They exchanged glances, and Venerable Sikong Muyue said in a low voice, "When the change began, I sent them</p><p>    out, then returned to meet you. I didn't encounter the two Fellow Daoists."</p><p>Elder Du Yi looked around and</p><p>    asked in surprise, "Fellow Daoist Xuanyu and I ascended the celestial peak and became trapped after encountering</p><p>    danger. That's understandable, but why hasn't Elder Dique come out yet? Could he also be trapped in a</p><p>    restriction?"</p><p>By this time, the Fire Spirit Beasts were getting closer and closer. Lava was even starting to</p><p>    seep out of the ground near the stone monument.</p><p>Venerable Sikong Muyue shook her head and said to Che Yutao,</p><p>    "This is not a place to stay for long. We should leave first. I think the collapse is beginning to slow down. This</p><p>    place should not be completely destroyed. The two Fellow Daoists are protected by fate, and as long as they can find</p><p>    a hiding place, they should be fine. We can think about a way to rescue them after the ruins stabilize."</p><p>Che</p><p>    Yutao remained silent, his expression dark and inscrutable.</p><p>Elder Du Yi spoke up, "Venerable Sikong's</p><p>    suggestion is sound. We must first ensure our own safety before we can spare resources to rescue our Fellow Daoists.</p><p>    Failing that, we can send someone back to Hanging Pass for reinforcements."</p><p>Seeing that the two were of the</p><p>    same mind, Che Yutao had no choice but to nod in agreement.</p><p>Before entering the stone monument, Qin Sang</p><p>    glanced back before returning his gaze forward. He stepped into the monument.</p><p>The world spun, and when his</p><p>    vision returned, he found himself standing on the rubble outside the ruins. Aside from Scattered Immortal Yunqiong,</p><p>    three people had also given up on the trial and were waiting there.</p><p>In total, six Foundation Establishment</p><p>    cultivators had lost their lives within the ruins.</p><p>Their disheveled appearances naturally startled Scattered</p><p>    Immortal Yunqiong and the others. After hearing what had happened, they were filled with relief.</p><p>Che Yutao and</p><p>    his companions conferred briefly, then planted themselves by the entrance, showing no intention of leaving.</p><p></p><p>    Qin Sang and the others waited for orders. They didn't dare to leave without permission, so they sat on the ground</p><p>    nearby. Some of them regulated their breathing, and others treated their injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang looked inward at</p><p>    the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm in his Qi Sea. Despite his impatience, he didn't use his Divine</p><p>    Understanding to probe it. Instead, he let it recuperate on its own.</p><p>Qin Sang then laid several restrictions</p><p>    in his Qi Sea, completely hiding the aura of the Charm.</p><p>Just as Old Man Dique said, the Charm didn't belong to</p><p>    anyone, so as long as no one forcibly searched his Qi Sea, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm wouldn't be</p><p>    exposed.</p><p>After sealing the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes. He saw Che</p><p>    Yutao and the other two standing in a triangular formation near the entrance. They would occasionally release their</p><p>    Martial Arts to stimulate the appearance of the Black Hole and observe the changes within.</p><p>The stone tablet</p><p>    inside the Black Hole was initially calm, but it suddenly trembled violently. The Black Hole emitted a large amount</p><p>    of black light, as if it had transformed into a black sun.</p><p>The three Core Formation Cultivators quickly</p><p>    released their Martial Arts, creating a large restriction to block the black light. They wanted to prevent the</p><p>    strange phenomenon from attracting Cloud Beasts.</p><p>This continued for three days.</p><p>Finally, the Black Hole</p><p>    disappeared completely. The black light dispersed, and the stone tablet appeared, standing in the middle of the</p><p>    circular rubble. Everyone was astonished.</p><p>Though the stone tablet was covered in cracks, it was still intact.</p><p>    It had managed to avoid being crushed.</p><p>They waited for another three days. It remained calm, and there were no</p><p>    abnormalities.</p><p>It seemed that the ancient ruins were stable on the inside.</p><p>Sikong Muyue cautiously</p><p>    walked up to the stone tablet and placed her palm on it. Spirit Power surged from her palm, as if she was</p><p>    investigating it. After a long while, she said, "The Testing Grounds have been destroyed. That's why the entrance</p><p>    has been exposed."</p><p>Che Yutao and the others discussed it and summoned everyone. They wanted to re-enter the</p><p>    ancient ruins.</p><p>No one knew what dangers lurked within the ancient ruins. Qin Sang and the others were</p><p>    reluctant, but they had no choice but to obey. They formed a massive Nine Radiance Star River Formation, with the</p><p>    three Gold Core Cultivators leading it. As a group, they entered the Black Hole and walked towards the stone</p><p>    tablet.</p><p>After they entered, it was just as Sikong Muyue expected. They were not sent into the Testing Grounds</p><p>    but entered the ruins directly.</p><p>Excluding Nascent Soul cultivators, twenty-seven people entered the Ancient</p><p>    Cultivator's Ruins, but now only sixteen were gathered by the stone tablet.</p><p>Of course, some, like Recluse Yun</p><p>    Qiong, might have given up midway through the trial and left the ruins.</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived, he saw that Mu</p><p>    Yifeng and Yu Daiyue were both there, so he approached them.</p><p>"Are Martial Uncle Che and the others still</p><p>    inside?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked softly.</p><p>Mu Yifeng shook his head, staring gravely westward. "After the anomaly</p><p>    occurred, Senior Sikong ordered us to leave and wait, while he personally went to retrieve Martial Uncle Che and the</p><p>    others."</p><p>The collapse intensified. Some spatial rifts joined together, forming a gigantic crack thousands of</p><p>    feet long, resembling a monstrous maw, waiting to devour all intruders.</p><p>Space was torn apart, presenting an</p><p>    incredibly bizarre scene.</p><p>Some lava rivers suddenly stopped flowing. In other places, the earth and mountains</p><p>    were upside down, defying logic. This phenomenon worsened the closer one got to the four celestial peaks.</p><p></p><p>    However, the Nascent Soul cultivators were still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Elder Di Que and Daoist Xuan Yu were</p><p>    impossible to have appeared, but the other three hadn't shown themselves either.</p><p>Could all five Nascent Soul</p><p>    cultivators have perished?</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the apocalyptic scene, muttering to himself.</p><p>The loss of</p><p>    five Nascent Soul cultivators at once would be a significant blow to the major sects. Even the eight righteous sects</p><p>    had a limited number of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The Azure Firmament Sect suffered the most, as their sect</p><p>    leader was among them.</p><p>After waiting for a while longer, with the lava and fire spirits encroaching closer and</p><p>    closer to the stone tablet, and still no sign of the Nascent Soul cultivators, everyone began to grow restless.</p></p><p><p>Just then, someone suddenly exclaimed in delight, pointing into the distance. "Look over there!"</p><p>Looking in</p><p>    that direction, they saw three points of light appear among the spatial rifts. Space was far from stable, constantly</p><p>    fluctuating. Some rifts were expanding, while others were even drifting.</p><p>The points of light maneuvered</p><p>    precariously among them, narrowly avoiding being swallowed by the spatial rifts. Although they were extremely far</p><p>    away and indistinct, it was still a breathtaking sight.</p><p>Finally, the points of light emerged from the spatial</p><p>    rifts, only to be greeted by a swarm of raging fire spirits.</p><p>However, although numerous, the fire spirits</p><p>    appeared sparse compared to the vastness of the ruins. They weren't a major problem for Nascent Soul cultivators and</p><p>    were easily shaken off.</p><p>Soon, three figures materialized before everyone. It was Che Yutao and the other</p><p>    two.</p><p>Sikong Mu Yue and Du Yi seemed alright, but Che Yutao looked much more disheveled. His left arm had a</p><p>    noticeable wound, a large chunk of flesh seemingly torn away.</p><p>Che Yutao didn't immediately attend to his</p><p>    wound. His gaze swept over everyone, his face darkening abruptly. He demanded angrily, "Where is Daoist Xuan</p><p>    Yu?"</p><p>The pressure of a Nascent Soul cultivator's aura descended upon them, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p>    They felt as if a mountain was bearing down on them, utterly shocked. A cultivator at the late Core Formation stage</p><p>    managed to speak with difficulty, "Reporting to Martial Uncle Che, after the anomaly occurred, we haven't seen the</p><p>    two seniors. They… seem to still be inside…"</p><p>Che Yutao and the other two changed color upon hearing this. They</p><p>    exchanged glances, and Sikong Mu Yue said solemnly, "When the anomaly began, I sent them out and then returned to</p><p>    retrieve you. I didn't encounter the two Daoists."</p><p>Du Yi turned to look around, puzzled. "Daoist Xuan Yu and</p><p>    we ascended the celestial peaks. It's understandable if they were trapped by danger. But why hasn't Daoist Di Que</p><p>    escaped? Could he have been confined by some restriction as well?"</p><p>By now, the fire spirits were getting</p><p>    closer and closer. Lava was even seeping out of the ground near the stone tablet.</p><p>Sikong Mu Yue shook her</p><p>    head, looking at Che Yutao. "This is no place to linger. We'd best retreat first. I've noticed the collapse starting</p><p>    to slow down. This ruin shouldn't be completely destroyed. The two Daoists are fortunate souls. As long as they find</p><p>    a place to hide, they should be fine. We can try to rescue them after the ruins stabilize, which won't be too</p><p>    late."</p><p>Che Yutao's face was grim, and he seemed lost in thought.</p><p>Du Yi spoke impatiently, "Daoist</p><p>    Sikong's suggestion is good. We must ensure our own safety first before we have the capacity to rescue the two</p><p>    Daoists. If all else fails, we can send someone back to Skull-Hanging Pass for help."</p><p>Seeing that both of them</p><p>    agreed, Che Yutao had no choice but to nod in agreement.</p><p>Before entering the stone tablet, Qin Sang glanced</p><p>    back, then withdrew his gaze and stepped inside.</p><p>After a dizzying spell, his vision cleared. He was standing</p><p>    on the rubble outside the ruins. Besides Recluse Yun Qiong, three others had also given up on the trial and were</p><p>    waiting there.</p><p>In total, six Core Formation cultivators had perished within the ruins.</p><p>Seeing their</p><p>    disheveled state, Recluse Yun Qiong and the others were naturally astonished. After learning what had happened</p><p>    inside, expressions of relief appeared on their faces.</p><p>Che Yutao and the other two discussed amongst</p><p>    themselves through voice transmission for a moment, then stood by the entrance, showing no intention of leaving.</p></p><p><p>Qin Sang and the others, without receiving orders, dared not leave on their own. They also sat down nearby, some</p><p>    meditating, some tending to their wounds.</p><p>Qin Sang looked within, glancing at the Nine Dragons Chariot</p><p>    Talisman in his Qi sea. Suppressing his eagerness, he didn't probe the talisman with his divine sense but let it</p><p>    recover on its own.</p><p>He then placed several restrictions within his Qi sea, completely sealing the talisman's</p><p>    aura to prevent any leakage.</p><p>Just as Elder Di Que had said, the talisman was ownerless. As long as no one</p><p>    forcibly searched his Qi sea, there was no need to worry about the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman being exposed.</p></p><p><p>Having sealed the talisman, Qin Sang quietly opened his eyes. He saw Che Yutao and the other two standing in a</p><p>    triangular formation around the entrance, occasionally activating the black hole to observe the changes within.</p></p><p><p>The stele inside the black hole was initially calm, but then it suddenly trembled violently. The black hole erupted</p><p>    with dark light, resembling a black sun.</p><p>The three Foundation Establishment cultivators quickly reacted,</p><p>    setting up a large restriction to conceal the dark light and prevent the phenomenon from attracting cloud</p><p>    beasts.</p><p>This continued for three days.</p><p>Finally, the black hole vanished completely. The dark light</p><p>    dissipated, and the stele was clearly revealed, standing amidst the rubble, much to everyone's surprise.</p><p></p><p>    Although covered in cracks, the stele remained intact, luckily not shattered.</p><p>After another three days of</p><p>    quiet, the stele showed no further anomalies.</p><p>It seemed that the ancient cultivator's legacy site had</p><p>    stabilized.</p><p>Si Kong Muyue cautiously approached the stele, touching it with her palm. Spiritual power surged</p><p>    from her hand, seemingly probing the stele. After a long while, she said, "The trial space has been destroyed, which</p><p>    is why the entrance is exposed."</p><p>Che Yutao and the others discussed briefly, then summoned everyone. They</p><p>    intended to re-enter the ancient cultivator's legacy site.</p><p>At this point, no one knew what dangers lurked</p><p>    within the legacy site. Although reluctant, Qin Sang and the others had no choice but to obey. They formed a large</p><p>    Nine Radiances Star River Formation, led by the three Foundation Establishment cultivators, and entered the stele</p><p>    together.</p><p>Inside, as Si Kong Muyue had predicted, they were not separated into trial spaces but directly</p><p>    entered the legacy site.</p></p>
