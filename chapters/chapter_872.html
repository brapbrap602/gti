<h1>Chapter 864: Uninvited Guests</h1><p>“Keep going! Don't give it a chance to breathe!” Fang shouted as he urged his blood sword deeper.</p><p>The Kylin still had strength to resist. Countless bolts of lightning surged into the wound, preventing the blood sword from penetrating further.</p><p>Fang recalled his sword and continued the attack with the help of Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>The Kylin struggled to defend itself, its wounds increasing. These weren't superficial injuries like before; each one was deep, reaching the bone, and imbued with blood energy, causing unstoppable bleeding and preventing healing.</p><p>The battle raged on, but the outcome was decided.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>During the fight, their true essence was constantly being absorbed by the crystalline stele. Their corpse pills were depleted, and Qin Sang was forced to draw on his golden core.</p><p>The others, without external pills, were consuming even more energy.  They had been worried, but now, seeing victory within reach and the treasure about to be theirs, they couldn't help but smile.</p><p>Fang appeared ecstatic, his eyes gleaming with greed, but inwardly he was tense, his body rigid.</p><p>Unnoticed by the others, while attacking the Kylin, he kept glancing towards the sea, from where the Kylin had appeared, as if waiting for something.</p><p>The others, oblivious, continued their relentless assault.</p><p>The cage constricted further.</p><p>Ma Debo urged Fang not to hold back, to unleash the full power of the blood sword and kill the Kylin quickly.</p><p>The Kylin’s resistance began to weaken; victory seemed imminent. Just then, several points of light suddenly flickered in the distant dark clouds, clearly visible in the night, flying towards the battlefield at incredible speed.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A loud shout echoed through the stormy night.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, everyone noticed the approaching lights, recognizing them as the flying lights of cultivators, and powerful ones at that, at least at the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Hearing the shout, they instinctively slowed their attack, exchanging glances of surprise and tension.</p><p>Out at sea, unbound by rules, seizing prey from another's jaws was commonplace.</p><p>Their hunt for the Kylin, while fierce, had been swift thanks to their thorough preparation.  They hadn't expected to attract other cultivators, especially such strong ones!</p><p>Qin Sang and the others looked at Fang.</p><p>The newcomers were clearly hostile and powerful. If they intended to claim the Kylin, another battle was inevitable.</p><p>They had already expended a significant amount of true essence maintaining the Cold Wind and Fierce Fire Formation.</p><p>After the Kylin’s death, the body would belong entirely to Fang. They would receive nothing.  None of them wanted to fight others in their weakened state, especially for someone else’s gain.</p><p>Moreover, the Kylin was not yet dead.  Facing these newcomers meant trouble from both within and without.</p><p>Fang gripped his blood sword, staring at the approaching lights, silent.</p><p>…</p><p>In a stretch of sea far from the island, several figures in black robes lurked beneath the surface.</p><p>They blended seamlessly with the water, their movements following the currents, their presence remarkably subtle. Through the water, they could faintly see the battle on the island.</p><p>They, too, noticed the uninvited guests.</p><p>“They’re here!” Second Brother’s low voice reached the others through sound transmission. “Quick! Raise the Beast King Banners!”</p><p>Without a word, they sat in a circle underwater.</p><p>Around them, numerous banners materialized, swirling.  The banners, which had been present all along, were made of gold, each depicting a different beast.</p><p>There were eighty-one in total!</p><p>As they channeled their power, the beasts on the banners seemed to come alive, roaring silently.  A strange force rapidly connected all the banners.</p><p>Each person controlled a portion of the banners, with Second Brother controlling twice as many as the others. The strain was evident in his heavy breathing.</p><p>“Second Brother, could there be a Nascent Soul cultivator among them? What if… What if something happens to First Brother…?”  A disciple asked timidly, after the formation was set.</p><p>Second Brother glared. “Don’t speak such ill omens! With First Brother’s wisdom, he would have taken precautions! If there truly were a Nascent Soul cultivator, First Brother would have already escaped! From now on, everyone focuses on powering the Beast King Banners. Remember, don’t let a single one escape!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>…</p><p>On the island.</p><p>Everyone looked at Fang, awaiting his decision.</p><p>Fang’s face shifted between pale and livid.  He glared at the incoming lights and thrust his blood sword at the Kylin, shouting, “Kill!”</p><p>“They are fast and powerful. We may not have time to kill the Kylin…” Qiu Ji warned.</p><p>The other four remained motionless. The Cold Wind and Fierce Fire Formation rotated on its own, its icy energy trapping the Kylin, but it exerted no further pressure. Without the formation’s support, the blood sword’s power was diminished.</p><p>Against the Kylin's desperate counterattacks, the sword strikes were ineffective.</p><p>Chu Heng, as the formation's anchor, sat on the crystalline stele, eyes closed, controlling the formation, silent.  Ma Debo’s eyes darted around. He gave Qin Sang and the others a look and voiced his agreement with Qiu Ji.</p><p>The usually taciturn Luo Kun also spoke up.</p><p>Qin Sang coughed lightly and concurred. He was in good condition, and the approaching cultivators weren't so powerful as to make him flee, but he wasn't going to fight for strangers without good reason.</p><p>Fang's promised reward was for killing the Kylin, not for fighting other cultivators.</p><p>Fang feigned anger, his face dark.  He stared at each of them in turn, and after a moment of silence, said, “Once this beast is dead, I only want its sinew. I’ll keep my promise of reward, and the rest of its body will be divided equally among the five of you. How about that?”</p><p>At these words, everyone exchanged glances, their hearts stirred.</p><p>The most valuable treasures on a Kylin were its demon pill, its sinew, bones, and hide. Fang only wanted the sinew and was even offering to share the demon pill – his sincerity was undeniable.</p><p>The Kylin’s demon pill, likely containing abundant lightning power, was extremely rare.  Whether used to refine lightning-based treasures or sold to lightning cultivators, its value would far surpass that of other demon beasts.</p><p>Battle-hardened and decisive, they agreed almost without hesitation, pressing their palms onto the crystalline stele, releasing a surge of true essence.</p><p>Fang, outwardly furious but inwardly calm, sneered. He said nothing more and silently urged his blood sword forward.</p><p>The Kylin was in mortal danger.</p><p>Its injuries worsened, its lightning weakened, its massive body covered in wounds and stained crimson, a truly pitiful sight.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others intensified their attack. The Kylin retreated step by step, even being knocked from the sky, its cries echoing in anguish.</p><p>The approaching cultivators, witnessing the Kylin’s state, were filled with alarm and fury.</p>
