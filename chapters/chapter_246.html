<h1>**Chapter 239: Cooperation**</h1><p>This unexpected encounter shocked the other party, but it also completely disrupted Qin Sang’s plan. With all his might, he urged the Ten Directions Yama Banner. Feeling the spiritual energy in his body being consumed at an alarming rate, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>The five-colored glass over his head suddenly released a dazzling rainbow light, and the endless drizzle was instantly transformed into steel needles, their murderous intent apparent. In an instant, a large number of the surrounding flying monkeys were killed.</p><p>Qin Sang did not hesitate to unleash the power of the Five Colors Glass, greatly reducing the pressure on his body. However, the Five Colors Glass would not last long. Qin Sang could only seize this opportunity to close the distance to the next stone platform as much as possible.</p><p>After flying for some distance, Qin Sang heard a crisp cracking sound.</p><p>The庆云 made of Five Colors Glass instantly shattered into pieces. The remaining might transformed into a violent storm, finally opening up a path for Qin Sang before completely dissipating.</p><p>This level had exhausted the power of the Five Colors Glass, which was truly a pity. However, Qin Sang also felt much more relaxed. When he saw the outline of the stone platform in the mist ahead, although his spiritual energy was greatly depleted, his body was uninjured.</p><p>The flying monkeys were blocked by the barrier behind them. Qin Sang stumbled onto the stone platform. His figure suddenly froze slightly. There was actually a person sitting on the stone platform!</p><p>This person’s aura was restrained, and his figure was hidden. He was meditating on the stone platform.</p><p>Qin Sang had not noticed him at all before. When he escaped the siege of the flying monkeys and boarded the stone platform, he discovered the other party’s presence only when he was close.</p><p>Fortunately, he had concealed the Ten Directions Yama Banner beforehand.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of the stone platform, the Ebony Sword hovering around him as he vigilantly observed the other party’s hiding place.</p><p>Moments later, the other party’s figure appeared. He looked at Qin Sang with surprise.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, is it you?”</p><p>“Senior Brother Yu?”</p><p>Qin Sang was also a little surprised. This person turned out to be Yu Daiyue.</p><p>Yu Daiyue’s condition did not seem to be very good. His aura was slightly chaotic, and his left arm hung limply by his side. There were countless scars left by the fire staff, and it was estimated that the bones in his arm were all broken.</p><p>There was even more blood on his body. Judging from his battered appearance, all this blood was his own.</p><p>It seemed that Yu Daiyue had also just passed the previous level of the trial not long ago. He could not even treat his injuries, so he had been meditating cross-legged to adjust his breathing. After all, in such a place, restoring spiritual energy was the most important thing.</p><p>Yu Daiyue was in a far more sorry state than Qin Sang. Therefore, when he saw that Qin Sang had passed the trial without any obvious injuries, he could not help but be greatly surprised. His eyes flickered as he said hoarsely,</p><p>“I never thought that Junior Brother Qin’s strength had grown to this extent. You were able to face those terrifying flying monkeys so easily. Senior Brother was entangled by the flying monkeys and almost lost his life inside. In the end, I had no choice but to lose an arm before I could escape. Compared to Junior Brother Qin, Senior Brother is truly ashamed!”</p><p>The person he had encountered earlier should not have been Yu Daiyue. It was probably one of the Foundation Establishment later stage cultivators.</p><p>Thinking about this, Qin Sang heard Yu Daiyue’s words and said with a helpless and bitter smile, “Senior Brother Yu thinks too highly of Junior Brother. Don’t you know my background? I only managed to escape the entanglement of the flying monkeys after reluctantly destroying a top-grade magic weapon. Comparatively speaking, I would rather lose an arm. After all, an arm can always be healed, but a top-grade magic weapon requires an unknown amount of effort to obtain. Especially in a place like this, if I lose a top-grade magic weapon, my strength will be greatly affected. I’m afraid the future journey will be fraught with danger…”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and sighed, his expression filled with frustration.</p><p>Yu Daiyue’s expression eased slightly when he heard this. He agreed, “It is indeed a pity! However, Junior Brother Qin’s spirit sword has an extraordinary aura. It must be your Natal Spirit Sword, right? With this sword, you will definitely be safe… I won’t hide it from Junior Brother Qin. Thinking about the experiences of the previous three levels, Senior Brother still has lingering fears. This ancient immortal’s trial is far more difficult and dangerous than imagined. I don’t know how many more levels there are ahead, and Senior Brother has little confidence in passing them alone. It’s just a coincidence that I met Junior Brother Qin. Why don’t the two of us join forces? We should be able to go further. What does Junior Brother Qin think?”</p><p>“I’m all for it. I’ll have to rely on Senior Brother Yu in the future!”</p><p>Qin Sang pretended to be overjoyed and agreed, having already weighed the pros and cons.</p><p>While working with Yu Daiyue, he could not use the Ten Directions Yama Banner or the Myriad Mechanism Sword Formation. It was best not to use them in case he associated them with something.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had not spent the past twenty years in vain. He had accumulated some不错magic weapons, which were far inferior to the Ten Directions Yama Banner, but were more than enough to deal with enemies. Moreover, he still had the Jade Ruyi talisman.</p><p>If the situation gets out of hand and they really have to draw the sword, any excuse will do to separate himself from Yu Daiyue. When disaster strikes, everyone flees for his own life; that's only human nature.</p><p>He has cooperated with Yu Daiyue once before, and besides, they are fellow students, so there was a natural level of trust between them. Even if Yu Daiyue did harbour evil intentions towards him, he would not be defenseless, and his hidden tricks would certainly teach Yu Daiyue a harsh lesson.</p><p>Pleased to hear Qin Sang's ready agreement, Yu Daiyue gave a satisfied smile. “This elder brother must tend to his wounds. Little brother Qin, you should also recover your vitality. As soon as we are ready, you and I will leave at once. I assume those brothers with profound cultivation have already passed the trials and entered the ruins. If we delay any longer, we might end up missing out altogether.”</p><p>Qin Sang was highly satisfied with the devil's weaponry he had serendipitously picked up, and having upgraded the Ten Directions Yama Banner to perfection, but he was not one to turn down potential further gains. He sat down cross-legged on the edge of the stone disk, concentrated, and began to circulate his cultivation method.</p><p>Yu Daiyue gazed at Qin Sang for a moment, then, swallowing a medicinal pellet to heal his injuries, closed his eyes.</p><p>All was quiet on the stone disk.</p><p>As they were recovering, no one else climbed up. Suddenly, Yu Daiyue woke from his meditation and said in a low voice, “Little brother Qin, this elder brother's injuries have stabilized; we can leave now.”</p><p>Yu Daiyue shifted his left arm, feeling some discomfort, but it did not impede him.</p><p>Qin Sang had long since regained his full strength, and, having heard Yu Daiyue, he immediately stood up and summoned his Ebonywood Sword. After a moment's thought, he brought out the Sky Poison Veil he had taken from the old man in black robes, along with the Yin Profundity Thunder and Jade如意 talisman that he held in his palm.</p><p>Poison mist shrouded Qin Sang, giving off waves of cold, strange-smelling air.</p><p>It was no surprise that Foundation Establishment cultivators in the ancient immortal battlefield might have two or three supreme weapons, so Yu Daiyue glanced at them but did not inquire further.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the two carefully entered the mist.</p><p>To their surprise, after venturing some distance into the mist, they did not see any of the familiar red clouds, or even a single fire spirit beast. It seemed as if there were none whatsoever here.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yu Daiyue exchanged puzzled glances, instantly becoming more vigilant.</p><p>Something was amiss!</p><p>There must be something more dangerous here than fire spirit beasts.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt a strange sensation at the edge of the poison mist, as if it had touched something.</p><p>Yu Daiyue also noticed the anomaly, and exclaimed, “Be careful!”</p>
