<h1>Chapter 816: Astonishing Abilities</h1><p>After six months, Qin Sang had gathered almost all the information he needed.</p><p>The cultivators near Cooling Hills Island held Luo Daotong in great awe, but very few had actually seen him. Luo Daotong's appearances were rare, and he seldom visited the island.</p><p>Unlike the Sect Leader of the Vast Sea Sect, this man was a loner. He had never taken any disciples, didn't socialize with friends, and wasn't involved in any power struggles.</p><p>This made things very difficult for Qin Sang.</p><p>He had observed Cooling Hills Island from afar many times and seen the shimmering glow of powerful protective formations. His only chance seemed to be waiting for Luo Daotong to leave the island.</p><p>The timing was uncertain, and Qin Sang couldn't just float on the sea indefinitely; he could easily miss his opportunity.</p><p>Patience was one thing Qin Sang didn't lack.  He continued cultivating while pondering his next move.</p><p>Three more months passed unnoticed.</p><p>Late one night, Qin Sang sat meditating in front of his cave, drawing upon the power of the stars to temper his body. A faint starlight enveloped him, his skin shimmering.</p><p>Suddenly, something startled him awake. He looked down at his dantian.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly had awakened!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy as he released the butterfly.</p><p>Transformed, the Skyeye Butterfly flew with even greater grace than before, flitting around Qin Sang, its form flickering in and out of existence, dreamlike under the starlight.</p><p>Apart from the patterns on its wings, the butterfly's appearance hadn't changed significantly, but its aura was markedly stronger.</p><p>The third transformation of the Skyeye Butterfly!</p><p>Feeling the butterfly's affection, Qin Sang smiled and extended his divine sense to communicate with it.</p><p>Records stated that after the third transformation, the Skyeye Butterfly would possess the Skyeye ability, a powerful gift, but the details were vague.  Qin Sang was naturally very curious.</p><p>As his natal insect, communication was effortless.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>Suddenly, lightning crackled on the butterfly's wings, turning them silver-white as if bathed in thunder. Then, with a powerful flap of its wings, the butterfly unleashed a bolt of white lightning as thick as a man's arm.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The lightning struck a bluestone in front of the cave, shattering it instantly. A large crater appeared on the cliff face, and the ground trembled.</p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p>Qin Sang assessed the power of the lightning and nodded slightly.</p><p>He had initially hoped the transformed Skyeye Butterfly would have the power of a cultivator of the same realm. It seemed to fall short, not possessing an innate lightning ability.</p><p>However, it was more than enough for self-preservation, at least ensuring it wouldn't die unexpectedly.</p><p>The thunderclap alerted other cultivators on the mountain, startling them from their meditation.  They emerged to investigate.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ma Yu's caves were both at the summit, not far apart, occupying the two best spots on the spiritual vein. Ma Yu, also alerted, emerged from his cave with a look of bewilderment.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang was surprised to discover that he could see Ma Yu directly through the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>The illusory mist barrier of Ma Yu's cave's protective formation was transparent to the butterfly. Although Ma Yu's cultivation was limited and the formation's power wasn't strong, Qin Sang wouldn't have been able to see through it with his naked eye without employing special techniques.</p><p>"Is this the Skyeye ability? It can see through illusions!"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly hovered in the air, the eye-spots on its wings actually moving, their pupils silver-white and lifelike.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue, what happened?"</p><p>Ma Yu stepped out of his formation, looked around, saw nothing amiss, and approached Qin Sang's cave, calling out. Every move he made was observed by Qin Sang.</p><p>"I was a bit hasty in my cultivation and caused an accident. I apologize for disturbing everyone. My spiritual energy is unstable at the moment, so please excuse me for not coming out to greet you…"</p><p>Qin Sang explained.</p><p>"Are you injured, Daoist? If you need assistance, don't hesitate to ask."</p><p>Ma Yu expressed his concern.</p><p>Qin Sang had been there for less than a year, but they got along very well. Qin Sang was unassuming and didn't seek power or profit, so Ma Yu's attitude towards him had become increasingly friendly.</p><p>"Fortunately, I noticed it in time and I'm fine. Thank you for your concern."</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed them with a few words, keeping the Skyeye Butterfly focused on Ma Yu, as he had made another startling discovery!</p><p>Ma Yu, unsuspecting, dispersed the others and returned to his cave.</p><p>As Ma Yu opened his protective formation and entered, Qin Sang held his breath, his mind linked with the Skyeye Butterfly, staring intently at the formation.</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang exhaled slowly, his eyes gleaming with excitement and delight as he looked at the Skyeye Butterfly. "What an incredible ability! Not only can it see through illusions, but it can also perceive the weaknesses of formations and restrictions!"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished, completely taken aback by the power of the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>Just now, the butterfly had easily identified the flaws in Ma Yu's protective formation and found a way to break it.</p><p>Qin Sang, despite his considerable skill in formations, couldn't have done it so easily.</p><p>Most terrifyingly, this wasn't due to the Skyeye Butterfly's deep understanding of formations and restrictions, but purely instinctive, an innate ability of the Skyeye.</p><p>And it would work just as well on mysterious and complex ancient formations and restrictions!</p><p>Of course, Ma Yu's formation wasn't top-tier, and with the butterfly's current limited cultivation, its performance against more complex and powerful formations wouldn't be as astonishing.</p><p>"Skyeye Butterfly, Skyeye Butterfly… Is this why it's ranked alongside those legendary wondrous insects? This ability is terrifying, more useful than the Venom Warding Carapace of the Fat Silkworm. After its next transformation, with its help, I'll have a chance to decipher the mysterious ancient formations and restrictions in those hidden realms of the cultivation world."</p><p>"However, cultivating the Skyeye Butterfly is no easy feat.  For others, even a lifetime wouldn't be enough to witness its third transformation.</p><p>"Crimson Gold Vine was equally rare and precious in ancient times. Nearly eighty percent of the Crimson Gold Fluid from one spiritual fruit went into the Skyeye Butterfly's belly, only enough for it to reach the third transformation. The Fat Silkworm advanced after just a few drops.</p><p>"If it were left to evolve on its own, it might take forever.</p><p>"With so little Crimson Gold Fluid left, the Skyeye Butterfly's chances of reaching the fourth transformation are slim.  Without some fortuitous encounter, the sheer amount of time required would be enough to drive one to despair."</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his excitement, abandoning such wishful thinking, and steadied his mind.</p><p>His initial intention in acquiring a natal insect was to cultivate a peak third-transformation spirit insect to assist him in forming his Nascent Soul. Having successfully helped the Skyeye Butterfly reach the third transformation, he had essentially completed most of his goal.  Anything else was a bonus.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang continued to explore the butterfly's abilities, enthralled, his mind connected to the insect.  The transformed Skyeye Butterfly was more intelligent and could communicate simply with Qin Sang, acting as a flexible extension of himself.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang made a brief appearance outside, then departed from South Crossing Island.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly's ability had given him a new idea. If he could decipher Cooling Hills Island's protective formation, he could directly enter the island.</p>
