      Hu!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Godoran spaceship landed, and Nagakin walked up to Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “How’s the situation? Did you take care of the Mutation Source?”
                Nagakin asked anxiously.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I got rid of it,” Han Xiao replied casually while his
                mechanical suit was retracting.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “New command, begin to collapse the Mechanical Beast Guards
                Army.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The next moment, the few thousand mechanical beasts transformed
                back into their compressed orbs and rolled over to Han Xiao’s
                side through an electromagnetic force.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao then shot out a compressed orb, which transformed into
                a long dark red metal box that was about two meters tall. All of
                the compressed orbs then rolled into the box and filled it up.
                Following which, the box shut itself automatically, and an
                engraved ‘001’ could be seen on the box.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The box was a ‘mobile army camp’, which was a necessity for
                those who pursued the Army Style. Different Mechanical Armies
                would be placed in the different army boxes, and each army box
                represented an army.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The serial number of the Mechanical Beast Guards Army was 001 as
                it was the first complete army that Han Xiao had constructed. An
                army box contained the compressed orbs of a single army, and the
                lock of the box was made from a powerful electromagnet together
                with the control of an AI. It was difficult to open it through
                any other means, and only Han Xiao was able to control it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      When the box was completely filled with compressed orbs, the box
                would not be able to be compressed into a compressed orb. While
                it would not be convenient to bring the box around, it was not
                too troublesome to use it. With Phillip controlling the box and
                the high-speed module being attached to it, Han Xiao did not
                have to carry the box around with him. With a single command,
                the army box would quickly be transported to the battlefield.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The bottom of the army box began spitting out flames, and it
                rapidly ascended into the sky. A door on the belly of the
                BlackLight Stealth opened up, and the army box was swallowed up.
                There was a simple maintenance room in the spaceship, and it
                could calculate the losses and damage to the machines. With the
                opponents being beasts that were far beneath Han Xiao’s
                strength, the losses were negligible.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The beasts were escaping in all directions, and the battle was
                already over. Nagakin ordered his subordinates to clean up the
                battlefield while he took out his detector and confirmed that
                the Mutation Source had disappeared completely.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “That’s great. I shall inform the upper echelons immediately
                that the antidote is successful!” Nagakin was overjoyed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At that moment, the mercenary group’s spaceships also arrived,
                and Herlous appeared together with the rest. Han Xiao instructed
                them to clean up the battlefield and bring back the beast
                carcasses. Those carcasses were precious materials, and Emerald
                Grass could use them to create Genetic Medicine. While it was
                not of much use to him, Han Xiao would be able to earn a small
                fortune by selling it to the players.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Jupiter and the others did not manage to snatch the last hit and
                had even died once or twice instead. All of their faces were
                depressed as they stood nearby.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, the other players were all extremely excited on the
                forums.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Right when Black Star killed the Mutation Source, the progress
                meter of the Main Storyline Mission on their interface had shot
                up, and a Mission Complete notification had popped up on their
                interfaces.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      All the players of Planet Aquamarine received a bountiful reward
                from the Main Storyline Mission. While their reward differed
                according to their contributions, the reward that they received
                on average was far more than a side mission.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, what excited the players the most was not the reward of
                the mission. With the Main Storyline Mission of Planet
                Aquamarine completed, this meant that it was time for them to
                enter the Galaxy!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After spending so much time on Planet Aquamarine, the only thing
                that could attract them now was the galaxy. In the past, they
                could only watch Bun-Hit-Dog’s videos to understand the galaxy,
                but they could personally experience it now. With the [Mutation
                Disaster] mission behind them, many players looked forward to
                the future plot and were all extremely excited.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In contrast, it was a completely different sight with the
                citizens of Planet Aquamarine.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ten minutes after the end of the battle, the Sanctuary and Six
                Nations received news from Godora that the Mutation Source had
                been destroyed. Without any delay, they immediately announced
                this piece of news to the entire planet. All the refugees
                sitting in front of a television or radio received the news.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the cities of the Six Nations and Black Phantom Sanctuary,
                countless individuals revealed looks of disbelief. Their faces
                became agitated before they began shedding tears of joy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They had survived the calamity!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They were still alive!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The entire planet erupted into cheers!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      All the cities were drowned in the joy of surviving the
                calamity. Some of them cried out at the top of their lungs, some
                danced on the streets, while others bawled with tears of joy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The cheers of the people formed a huge wave, rushing into the
                sky, echoing in the horizon.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
                Thinking about the calamity that their planet had faced, it had
                been akin to a living hell. Everything was finally over.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The citizens of Planet Aquamarine could not help but burn with
                hope for their future.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The upper echelons of the Six Nations and Bennett worked
                together and announced that Black Star was the one who had
                killed the Mutation Source. They tried to create the image that
                Black Star was the noble savior of the entire planet.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With the citizens of the planet being overwhelmed with joy, the
                effects of the advertisement were extremely obvious. Almost all
                of the refugees were filled with gratitude to Black Star.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With the calamity over, the Six Nations had to begin thinking
                about their future. They would still maintain their respect to
                Godora on the surface but had already accepted Black Star’s
                conditions in secret. They decided to stake it all on Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao, who was still on the battlefield, naturally was not
                aware of the situation. While the others were cleaning up the
                battlefield, he walked to the side and opened up his interface.

      Han Xiao’s current mission reward limit was extremely high, and
                the effect of a single Legendary Point was extremely obvious.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After taking a look at the mission reward, Han Xiao directed his
                attention to the first kill reward, which allowed him to draw
                two of the Mutation Source’s abilities. This was the greatest
                reward to him.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao did not take action immediately. He first looked around
                and found Feidin. Without even asking for permission, he touched
                Feidin to his heart’s content.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Yes, I can feel the effect of luck.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao rubbed his palms in excitement and began to draw his
                reward under Feidin’s helpless gaze.

      You have received the opportunity to draw two of the half-mature
                Mutation Source’s abilities.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Note: The Mutation Source is a special life form, and you are
                unable to draw its innate abilities. The abilities that you can
                draw will be adjusted accordingly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      _____________________
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       The abilities are adjusted indeed,
      </em>
      Han
                Xiao thought to himself.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This was a common occurrence when drawing abilities. If the
                target was too special, some abilities would not be replicated.
                For example, shapeshifting, sensory organs, and emotional
                control were all innate abilities of the Mutation Source.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It was just like if a human player wanted to draw for the
                abilities of a demon. Even if a demon had a tail whip ability, a
                player would not draw such an ability since they did not have a
                tail. The hardware just was not compatible with such an ability.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      When two species were too different, even if the abilities could
                be extracted, there would be a change in the effects. All the
                race specific elements would be removed, and it would be changed
                into a more general skill. For example, the tail whip attack of
                a demon might be changed into something like a heavy kick
                attack. It definitely would not be changed into an attack that
                made use of whips.

      Randomizing… Draw complete.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Please select two of the five reward:
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      1. [Harden] Skill: +65% Physical Resistance, -30% Dexterity. Stamina
                Usage: 300, Duration: 14 seconds, Cooldown: 30 seconds.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      2. [Middle Grade Cell Proliferation Control] Talent: Make use of
                energy to proliferate cells, heal wounds, and convert energy
                into HP at the ratio of 1:5. Recovery rate capped at 28% of
                total HP per second.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      3. [Grinder] Skill: Close combat skill. Make use of grips and
                locks to deal damage. Capable of causing damage eight times, and
                40 to 60% of the damage will ignore the enemy’s defense. Has a
                chance of causing status inflictions such as [Fracture],
                [Numbness], and so on. Energy Usage: 60, Stamina Usage: 140,
                Cooldown: 15 seconds.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      4. [Energy Storage] Skill: Obtain an extra energy bar that is
                25% of total energy. When exhausting the extra energy bar, it
                won’t affect one’s own energy bonus. Duration: 2 days, Cooldown:
                3 days. (Additional energy obtained won’t count toward the
                energy level.)
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      5. [Energy Absorption] Talent: When subject to any physical,
                energy, magical, or other attacks, 60% of the damage offset by
                resistance will be converted into energy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      _____________________
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After adjustments, the effects of the skills and talents could
                be stronger or weaker. The cell proliferation and energy
                absorption talents of the Mutation Source had been weakened
                after removing the special effects of the Mutation Source.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, the appearance of those two talents was a huge surprise
                for Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The way he saw it, those two talents were the most valuable
                abilities of the Mutation Source. If he could obtain a single
                one of them, it would be considered pretty good. However, if he
                could obtain both together, it would be a perfect combination!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Simply put, he would be able to regain energy by being hit, and
                using energy would be able to recover HP. While the regeneration
                rate would not be as perverse as that of the Mutation Source, he
                had the natural advantage of having high HP! With his HP being
                38,000, even a mere 28% of his HP was a huge figure. The amount
                of HP that he would regain was twice that of the Mutation
                Source!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      While the other three skills were not bad, he did not even
                remotely consider them after seeing the other two.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Even if the two talents were weaker, they were only weaker when
                compared to the original. Neither of the two talents could be
                considered weak, and they had both reached the level of a
                Molding Ability. Han Xiao could not have been happier.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had originally thought that getting one of the two talents
                would be a huge win and had mentally prepared himself for being
                unable to get even one. Who would have thought that he would
                actually be so lucky! Was touching Feidin really that effective?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao could not help but look at Feidin with a burning gaze.
                He had the sudden urge to extract a few hundred bottles of
                Ability Potions from Feidin, and both Feidin and Chen Xing could
                not help but tremble.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Retracting his gaze, Han Xiao made his choice without any
                hesitation.
