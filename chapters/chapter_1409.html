<h1>Chapter 1401: The Ten Thousand Demons Conference</h1><p>In the Northern Star Region.</p><p>Yuan Ying cultivators sometimes use alliance meetings as opportunities for exchange, a sort of small trade fair.</p><p>Qin Sang had never heard of the Ten Thousand Demons Conference, a gathering of so many Yuan Ying experts with a late-stage Yuan Ying master personally overseeing it, and was very intrigued.</p><p>“The list only shows a small portion, used to attract attention. Even if you don't see the treasures you want, it's best not to miss it. There's nothing to lose, at the very least it's a chance to network with fellow cultivators...”</p><p>Valley Master Mu kindly advised.</p><p>As they spoke,</p><p>the four of them flew a further distance over the water.</p><p>At that moment, Valley Master Mu and the other two suddenly stopped, turned their heads, and looked at Qin Sang with smiles, all with expressions of anticipation.</p><p>“Daoist, haven’t you sensed anything unusual?”</p><p>Valley Master Mu asked with a smile.</p><p>Qin Sang felt puzzled and looked around.</p><p>The underwater was dark.</p><p>The cold currents flowed past his protective qi, all tangible.</p><p>Everything seemed normal.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly realized something, abruptly turning to look behind him, exclaiming in surprise: “Is the entrance to the Jing Hai Sect here?”</p><p>Valley Master Mu finally solved the mystery, pointing behind them, to the path they had come from: “Daoist, do you remember what I said earlier? We just passed through the Jing Hai Sect's formation; we are now on the other side.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Hearing this,</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his gaze fixed on what was behind him.</p><p>Although he was conversing with Valley Master Mu and the others, he remained vigilant, having already awakened his Sky Eye Butterfly and secretly activating his Sky Eye ability.</p><p>They had just passed through the formation, yet neither he nor the Sky Eye Butterfly had sensed anything.</p><p>The waters behind them looked exactly like anywhere else!</p><p>Valley Master Mu had briefly described his experiences, and Qin Sang hadn't expected the Jing Hai Sect's formation to be so bizarre. No wonder they still couldn't figure out its details.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's doubtful expression,</p><p>the Qi cultivator chuckled: “Daoist, don’t be surprised.  Go back and forth through it a few times; observe carefully and you'll realize what's wrong. To us, it's an ordinary body of water, even passing through the formation felt completely normal.  It's all an illusion; the path we took and what we perceived were not the same. Space seems to be displaced or folded here.  If we hadn’t noticed the anomaly beforehand, knowing this place was unusual, even passing through the formation, I wouldn't have realized it.”</p><p>Could it be a mustard seed space?</p><p>But even Yuan Ying cultivators only have a superficial understanding of space.</p><p>In today's cultivation world, refining a mustard seed pouch is the limit. How large a mustard seed space would be needed to house an entire sect?</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed, “What kind of anomaly did you, Fellow Daoist Qi, see at the time?”</p><p>The Qi cultivator pointed upwards towards the surface, “At the time, a beam of red light shot towards the sky. There was no earth-shattering event, and it only lasted a short time; it dissipated in less than an incense stick's worth of time.”</p><p>Nothing could be determined from the anomaly.</p><p>At this time, Valley Master Mu suggested they try a few more times.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around, first following the path they came from, then changing directions several times, going back and forth seven or eight times.</p><p>As the Qi cultivator had said,</p><p>no matter which direction they went, the result was the same.</p><p>There was no fluctuation, and the formation didn't attack intruders. If no one had mentioned it, Qin Sang would have surely ignored it.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly ordered the Sky Eye Butterfly to use its abilities to the fullest, but found no trace of an illusionary formation.</p><p>Valley Master Mu went in himself, letting Qin Sang observe from the outside.</p><p>Finally, they discovered that shortly after Valley Master Mu entered, space seemed to distort slightly, and he instantly appeared ahead. The 'teleportation' process was seamless; those inside the formation couldn't feel it.</p><p>The teleportation within the formation appeared without warning, leaving them helpless.</p><p>The formation had boundaries; viewed from above, it was roughly a large circular area, hidden deep beneath the sea, insignificant compared to the entire Azure Spirit Sea.</p><p>Unless someone intentionally passed through here and had a companion watching constantly, it would be almost impossible to detect.</p><p>It could be determined that the purpose of the formation was to protect the secret here.</p><p>That is, the entrance to the Jing Hai Sect as Valley Master Mu mentioned.</p><p>“Daoist, why not summon the Fire Jade Centipede, and see if it can sense the Myriad Spirits Fruit?” Valley Master Mu said expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and opened his mustard seed pouch.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede flew onto Qin Sang's palm, lazily lying in his palm.</p><p>It had just consumed a Fire Melting Pill and was digesting the medicinal power.</p><p>Qin Sang took it and tried several times, and as expected, the Fire Jade Centipede showed no reaction. Valley Master Mu followed closely behind Qin Sang, and both were teleported out; seeing this, disappointment was etched on their faces.</p><p>Qin Sang paid attention to Valley Master Mu's reaction.</p><p>Valley Master Mu, like him, had clear eyes, showing no signs of trance or illusion, which meant the formation's power wouldn't affect the primordial spirit.</p><p>This made Qin Sang feel even more troubled.</p><p>Tianmudie and Yufo, his two most powerful trump cards, were useless against the formation.</p><p>However, it was too early to conclude. If the power of the formation could be triggered, revealing its entirety, Tianmudie would certainly have a chance to shine.</p><p>"What does the Daoist mean?"</p><p>Mu Guzhu looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, then said, "Give me three more days. If I still can't figure out how to break the formation, I will deploy the Three Spirits Pan Wang Formation."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Mu Guzhu nodded.</p><p>The three retreated to the side, giving Qin Sang some space.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang was also at a loss, and found Mu Guzhu, agreeing to deploy the insect formation.</p><p>Mu Guzhu and the others were overjoyed and immediately began preparing the altar.</p><p>As agreed, Mu Guzhu first passed the Shengling Sacrifice and the Three Spirits Pan Wang Formation techniques to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Whoa! So many things to prepare!"</p><p>Qin Sang first looked at the Shengling Sacrifice he had been longing for, and was immediately shocked by the spiritual materials required for the ritual.</p><p>The list meticulously listed dozens of spiritual materials!</p><p>The Shengling Sacrifice could raise a spirit insect's level by one rank; it wasn't something ordinary.</p><p>During the Shengling process, the power that stimulates the spirit insect's potential comes partly from the owner and partly from external objects.</p><p>Fortunately, most of them weren't rare treasures.</p><p>However, some would require even a Yuan Ying cultivator to spend considerable effort collecting, and there was no guarantee of finding them.  Raising Tianmudie's level through the Shengling Sacrifice wasn't as easy as he imagined!</p><p>"Baihua Valley must have collected all the materials needed for the Shengling Sacrifice, but I wonder how much is left."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Mu Guzhu.</p><p>He also understood that these spiritual materials were certainly reserved for Baihua Valley's descendants.  Asking Mu Guzhu to give them to him would probably be harder than getting the Shengling Sacrifice technique itself.</p><p>He remained calm and suppressed the thought.</p><p>He planned to collect as many materials as possible himself, and only approach Baihua Valley to trade for those he couldn't find.</p><p>Continuing to read.</p><p>Qin Sang roughly understood why Lan Jingsi said that the success rate of outsiders performing the Shengling Sacrifice on spirit insects was lower than that of Baihua Valley disciples.</p><p>Because it was closely related to the  Soul-bound Insect Gu technique!</p>
