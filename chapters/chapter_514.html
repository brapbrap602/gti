<h1>Chapter 507: Root and Branch Extermination</h1><p>Qin Sang and Wandering Scholar discussed matters on the small island until nightfall before parting ways to make preparations.</p><p>After agreeing on a meeting time with Wandering Scholar, Qin Sang returned to the Earth Sink Cave. Seeing that the Night Fiend's condition hadn't improved, he realized it couldn't participate in this operation.</p><p>He refined more Lesser Yin Magnetic Flasks, filling his Mustard Seed Bag almost to the brim, and set off eastward alone, carrying ample Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>……</p><p>Mount Dihuo.</p><p>The location of the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>Mount Dihuo was a low volcano, hidden amongst towering mountains, quite inconspicuous.</p><p>Dove Robe Daoist established the sect here because of its remoteness. It was rarely visited, isolating it from outside cultivators and minimizing the risk of the Ghost Yin Sect remnants being exposed.</p><p>Since its establishment, the Demonic Flame Sect had maintained a low profile, secretly gathering the remaining Ghost Yin Sect disciples.</p><p>After killing Dove Robe Daoist, Qin Sang initially intended to wipe out the entire Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Night Fiend was nearly destroyed. Weighing his options, he prioritized its recovery. Later, preoccupied with preparing for Core Formation, he neglected the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>"The Demonic Flame Sect Master and the four Demonic Flame Emissaries all died by my hand.  Over a year with no high-level figures appearing, I wonder what the situation is now? Are the disciples still there?"</p><p>Qin Sang flew silently through the forest towards the Demonic Flame Sect, gazing at the distant mountains, muttering to himself.</p><p>He wasn't sure if this trip would be successful.  With the disappearance of the five high-ranking members for so long, the Demonic Flame Sect might have scattered in fear.</p><p>Crossing several mountain ridges, Qin Sang finally saw the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>To the east, north, and west of Mount Dihuo stood three towering peaks, forming a natural barrier, guarding the volcano.</p><p>Compared to these peaks, Mount Dihuo appeared small and squat.</p><p>A faint glow emanated from the volcano's summit, a sign that it was active, though unlikely to erupt soon.</p><p>There were two types of disciples in the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>One group consisted of the remaining Ghost Yin Sect disciples. The more powerful ones were sent out by Dove Robe Daoist to collect treasures, while the weaker ones lived in seclusion, afraid to leave their sanctuary.</p><p>The other group were new disciples recruited after the Demonic Flame Sect's establishment.</p><p>These new disciples didn't cultivate the Ghost Yin Sect's demonic arts, but rather a different cultivation method Dove Robe Daoist had found, one that harnessed the power of the earth fire.</p><p>They were fortunate. Dove Robe Daoist hadn't dared to recklessly refine the Ten Directions Yama Banner recently, so at least they didn't have to worry about becoming sacrifices for the demonic artifact.</p><p>Dove Robe Daoist's plan had been perfect.</p><p>Once they reached a certain level of cultivation, they could move freely in the outside world.</p><p>By then, Dove Robe Daoist would have taken over Ji Wu's body, changed his identity, and the Demonic Flame Sect could finally shed the shadow of the Ghost Yin Sect.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang had ruined everything.</p><p>These new disciples, unaware of the truth, were kept in the dark. Their cultivation was also low, and Qin Sang wouldn't be so ruthless as to kill them all.  As long as they hadn't committed any evil deeds, he would let them leave.</p><p>But the Ghost Yin Sect remnants had to die!</p><p>These individuals had witnessed the atrocities committed beneath the Yin Sha Abyss; none were innocent.</p><p>Only by eradicating them completely, ensuring the Ghost Yin Sect had no chance of revival, could Qin Sang avenge the wrongs done to those he knew, offering them solace in the afterlife.</p><p>Standing atop a distant mountain peak, Qin Sang surveyed Mount Dihuo.</p><p>At a glance, he could see a peculiar type of spiritual tree covering the volcano. Resembling maple trees, their red leaves stretched across the landscape, complementing the lava within the volcano.</p><p>These trees were part of the Demonic Flame Sect's protective formation, utilizing the Wood-Fire symbiotic relationship of the Five Elements, enhanced by the volcano's abundant fire energy.</p><p>Among the trees were huts and wooden houses, and he could faintly see figures moving about.</p><p>At the rear of the volcano were several noticeably more opulent halls.</p><p>In its early stages, Dove Robe Daoist hadn't focused on expansion, so the Demonic Flame Sect didn't have many disciples.</p><p>The Ghost Yin Sect remnants were already few, and further reduced by Qin Sang. There were likely only a dozen or so left, but all were Foundation Establishment cultivators, possessing considerable strength. The newly recruited disciples numbered only around two hundred, with very few at the Foundation Establishment stage, a fraction of the number at Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>At this moment, Mount Dihuo presented a peaceful scene. The disciples seemed unaware that their Sect Master and Emissaries were gone. Some younger disciples were even listening to their elders' teachings in the forest.</p><p>[Reading Benefit] Follow the public account [Book Friends Base Camp] to draw cash/coins every day!</p><p>"Could Dove Robe Daoist have left instructions?"</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more likely it seemed.  Before attempting the possession, Dove Robe Daoist would have made arrangements; otherwise, they wouldn't be so unconcerned.</p><p>This made things easier.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze over Mount Dihuo, then quietly circled around to a secluded valley behind the three peaks. The valley was exceptionally cold, a stark contrast to the fiery volcano.</p><p>Deep within the valley, beside a muddy swamp, was a dark cave, emitting wisps of Yin Sha Qi, sealed by a restriction.</p><p>Unlike Earthly Yin Qi, Yin Sha Qi wasn't hard to find. It often formed in places where life was consumed, in mountains of corpses, or in dark and cold environments.</p><p>The Ghost Yin Sect's cultivation methods relied on Yin Sha Qi. This cave wasn't large, and the Yin Sha Qi inside was far less abundant than in the Yin Sha Abyss, but it was sufficient for the remaining Ghost Yin Sect disciples.</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with the strength of the Ghost Yin Sect remnants. He raised the Ten Directions Yama Banner and the Ebony Sword. Having learned how to break the restriction from the captured Emissary, he easily entered the cave.</p><p>Inside, he found three people cultivating: one late-stage Foundation Establishment, and two mid-stage. Each occupied a separate area.</p><p>Qin Sang went straight for the late-stage cultivator.</p><p>The cave was pitch black.</p><p>Concealed within the Yin Sha Qi, Qin Sang approached silently.  He was soon close to the cultivator, who was meditating on a black rock, surrounded by warning restrictions and a protective spirit array formed by several small flags.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his hand opening to release the Ten Directions Yama Banner.  A surge of ghostly flames erupted.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>With a ripping sound, the protective spirit array was instantly shattered by the ghostly flames, the flags scattering, broken and torn.</p><p>The cultivator awoke, startled.  A dazzling sword light flashed before his eyes, accompanied by faint thunder, as swift as lightning.  Before he could react, he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen as the Ebony Sword pierced through him, severely injuring his dantian.</p><p>Terrifying sword energy rampaged within his core, his spiritual power rapidly dissipating.</p><p>"Ah..."</p><p>A dark figure suddenly appeared behind him, clamping a hand over his mouth, silencing his scream.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted him by the neck, easily capturing him.  Without pausing, he moved towards the other two.</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"Senior Brother Luo, what's wrong..."</p><p>Although alerted, the two were far weaker.  Qin Sang didn't even need the Ebony Sword, capturing them with ease.</p><p>Without much effort, all three were captured alive.</p><p>As expected, they were all Ghost Yin Sect remnants.</p>
