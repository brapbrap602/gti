<h1>Chapter 1829:  A Hasty Retreat</h1><p>Hong Yuzi's intentions were impossible to fathom.  Mo Xingdao's death had been too swift; Qin Sang didn't know the outcome of Hong Yuzi's battle with the two demons, nor how much strength Hong Yuzi had left.  </p><p>Qin Sang was now critically weakened. The flower essence was nourishing his depleted spiritual energy, but even a full recovery wouldn't change the situation.  He had slain three demons through sheer force, but was now severely wounded, relying solely on the Inner Lion Seal to suppress his injuries.  Even though Hong Yuzi's army formation had been broken, Qin Sang doubted he could fight another late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>His thoughts racing, Qin Sang made a quick decision. He took several jade vials, gulped down the flower essence, turned, and extended a hand towards the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>The firelight dimmed, leaving only the crown's glow in the palace. The five-colored radiance pulsed gently, seeming harmless, yet Qin Sang remained tense.  </p><p>Mo Xingdao had taught Qin Sang how to manipulate the Five Elements Crown, not through a treasure-controlling technique, but a simplified Five Elements restriction derived from the Imperial Mountain's Five Elements Divine Ban, drawing upon elemental energies. This was, in essence, the crown's controlling method.</p><p>Now, this method was clearly useless.  The crown's spirit was more like a mass of conflicting, chaotic consciousness – hypersensitive, frenzied, and utterly irrational. Any attempt to control it would be met with immediate, hostile resistance.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a way to control it, so he decided to stick to the original plan: take the crown and deal with it later.  In the past, the three Wise Light Saints had suppressed the spirit by taking turns wielding it, thus resisting the demonic influence.</p><p>Qin Sang had no such worries. Carefully, he sent his consciousness into the crown, letting the demonic thoughts wash over him. The madness within was terrifying, something most would fear, yet he accepted it without flinching.</p><p>Initially, the spirit sensed something and showed signs of unrest.  Under the influence of the demonic thoughts, the vibrations emanating from his consciousness began to change, aligning with the spirit’s aura.  </p><p>The spirit's agitation subsided, its hostility toward Qin Sang's consciousness lessening. Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang dispersed his consciousness, silently enveloping the crown, forming a thin barrier. This would partially isolate the spirit from the outside world, confusing its perception.</p><p>The consciousness barrier was formed. Qin Sang made a grasping motion; the Five Elements Crown trembled slightly, about to be drawn up, when the well platform suddenly shook violently.</p><p>The shaking was sudden. Qin Sang’s expression changed; he instantly cut off the drawing force, frowning at the well platform. The tremor had nearly awakened the crown's spirit.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang reached for the crown again, his movements much gentler.  The crown slowly rose and he successfully grasped it. He stored it in his Thousand-Jun Ring. He then glanced at the well platform, sensing a strange energy enveloping the area where the crown had been. This force had presumably drawn the crown into the well, but luckily it was dormant; Qin Sang's actions hadn't triggered a reaction.</p><p>Time was short.  Without further investigation, Qin Sang took the Five Elements Crown, scanned the hall, and found the antlers in a corner.  The antlers, one black and one white like jade, radiated a crystalline glow;  Xia Hou's only remaining possession.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved them, noticing several cracks where the luster was dull, damage from the demon core explosion. Holding the antlers in his left hand, he produced a flash of light with his right, revealing the fox and snake corpses. The snake corpse was relatively intact, while the fox corpse was horrifically mutilated, nearly dismembered.</p><p>Carrying the three corpses, Qin Sang swept his consciousness outwards, his expression shifting, before a small green light flew towards him.  It was the green jade bead the Green Fox Saint King had used to attack Xia Hou.</p><p>"This is the treasure you mentioned?" Qin Sang asked the nearby Mo Xingdao.</p><p>He sensed the power of a genuine treasure from the green bead.  No wonder the Green Fox Saint King had been able to force Xia Hou to use his life-saving ability, but this also distracted her, preventing her from retrieving the bead before Qin Sang took advantage of the opportunity.</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded. "This bead may have been damaged before.  Hui Guang Shengzhe helped her refine it. That fox demon relied on it for protection many times, until it was nearly shattered in two."</p><p>Qin Sang rotated the green jade bead, and indeed found a faint white mark.</p><p>Putting away the green jade bead and the hummingbird, Qin Sang paused, then also hid the phoenix wings. Without hesitation, he darted towards the palace exit.</p><p>Two black dragons regrouped and attacked.</p><p>Qin Sang smashed his way forward with powerful blows, unstoppable.</p><p>Inside, he frantically refined the flower dew into poison essence, but Qin Sang knew he couldn't wait any longer. The more he hesitated, the easier it would be for the opponent to see his weakness.</p><p>Besides, even if he wasn't Hong Yuzi's match, relying solely on his lightning escape technique, Hong Yuzi could hardly keep him!</p><p>Upon the mirror surface.</p><p>Hong Yuzi, though trapped by the sealing formation, showed no outward injuries.</p><p>Looking down at the mirror, he waved his hand, sending forth streams of yellow smoke. Some gently brushed across the mirror's surface, others stirred ripples.</p><p>Having just suffered a major setback, Hong Yuzi was extremely cautious. The Nine Return Bead hovered above his head, poised for action.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Ripples spread across the mirror's surface as Hong Yuzi probed its secrets.</p><p>His eyes flashed, and he struck downwards with a powerful palm strike.  The mirror surface shimmered, splitting open a narrow passage.</p><p>Hong Yuzi flicked his sleeve and stepped inside.</p><p>Unexpectedly, shortly after entering the mirror, he felt a powerful aura surge from deep within the mirror space, rushing towards him.</p><p>The force was so overwhelming that it even startled Hong Yuzi, yet it didn't belong to the two demons who had ambushed him earlier.</p><p>The opponent's aura was fierce.</p><p>Hong Yuzi was astonished.  He acted decisively and retreated immediately.</p><p>Then came a deafening roar, and a strange figure burst from the mirror, appearing in his vision.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Hong Yuzi looked at Qin Sang with a mixture of surprise and suspicion, seemingly struggling to understand the origin of this monster.</p><p>Apart from the lack of phoenix wings, Qin Sang's appearance was identical to what Xia Hou had seen – an image so strange that even demon cultivators found it unsettling.</p><p>Then, Hong Yuzi's pupils contracted, his face turning pale as he saw what Qin Sang held in his hand.</p><p>He had never seen a demonic serpent before, but judging from the corpse's aura, it must have been a powerful demon lord in life.</p><p>Even more shocking were the fox corpse and deer antler. The aura emanating from them was unmistakably that of the two demons who had ambushed him earlier.</p><p>The fox corpse was horribly mutilated.</p><p>Though he didn't see Xia Hou's corpse, even the deer antler was missing, and cracked. Xia Hou's fate was clear.</p><p>Three demon lords, all slain by this person?</p><p>This person's aura remained overwhelmingly powerful, seemingly without the slightest effort!</p><p>Hong Yuzi gasped, unable to conceal his shock, subconsciously taking several steps back, to the edge of the mirror.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were emerald green, like a deep pool, filled with a murderous glint.</p><p>Thanks to the Inner Lion Seal, his wounds had already healed. He stared straight at Hong Yuzi, breathing slightly heavily, seemingly hesitating, weighing something.</p><p>Hong Yuzi retreated to the edge of the mirror, the Nine Return Bead shimmering with light, his expression alert.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang made a decision. He took one last deep look at Hong Yuzi and turned to fly towards one end of the mirror.</p><p>The mirror connected to another illusionary scene, a landscape filled with thick, dark grey smoke. The heavy smoke blotted out the sun, like a grey sand realm, forming a wall of ash.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang about to enter the grey sand realm, Hong Yuzi hesitated, opening his mouth. "Friend…"</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang stopped and turned abruptly.</p><p>His eyes blazed with ferocity, like two sharp swords piercing forward.</p><p>Hong Yuzi paused involuntarily. With his mental fortitude, he would not be intimidated by a mere glare, but this person's record was truly horrifying.</p><p>Even if this person had used some external force, slaying three demon lords was still something unimaginable for ordinary people.</p><p>As he hesitated, Qin Sang stared at Hong Yuzi and slowly retreated into the grey sand realm, his figure swallowed by the smoke.</p><p>Hong Yuzi ultimately chose not to intervene.</p><p>Shielding himself from Hong Yuzi's perception, Qin Sang immediately turned around, summoned his phoenix wings, and with a flash of lightning, sped away using his lightning escape technique at full power.</p><p>The mirror space and the trap he had set weren't too far apart.  Qin Sang didn't dare to stop for a moment, traversing one illusion after another, until he finally returned to the 'Prison Cage Illusion'.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly had been watching behind him and hadn't spotted any pursuers, indicating that Hong Yuzi had indeed been deterred by his show of force.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and immediately sat cross-legged in the central cage.  His inner Lion Seal had reached its limit, the Buddha Seal's power was dissipating, and his old wounds immediately worsened, leaving him feeling profoundly weak.</p><p>His injuries were even more severe than before. Qin Sang waved his hand, producing several jade bottles.  He didn't bother checking what type of healing pills they were, swallowing them all in a desperate attempt to heal.</p><p>This place offered no concealment; he couldn't stay long.  </p><p>He suppressed his injuries and recovered his true essence as quickly as possible, then rose from the cage.</p><p>Before deciding to ambush Hong Yuzi, Qin Sang had prepared a retreat route. He followed it back to the flower field.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang remained extremely cautious, to avoid encountering Hong Yuzi.</p><p>The journey was uneventful, and he safely returned to the flower field, activating the protective array before finally feeling secure.</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat on a meditation cushion, reviewing the battle. Fatigue etched itself onto his face, not just from his serious injuries, but also from the immense mental strain.</p><p>He rarely took such risks.  This time, having slain three demons in succession, he had truly danced on the edge of a knife. Every single step had to be perfect.</p><p>A single misstep wouldn't necessarily lead to utter ruin, but it certainly would mean losing the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>After a moment of quiet meditation, Qin Sang used his sword to carve out a private chamber and summoned Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, seeing the cave dwelling, was uncertain of his location and looked puzzled.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "Friend Mo, this is my temporary residence in the Altar.  Please rest and recuperate. I also need to heal my wounds as soon as possible.”</p><p>Mo Xingdao's concealment in the Altar was a temporary measure. Qin Sang had sworn not to control Mo Xingdao and had no intention of breaking his oath.</p><p>Qin Sang also considered that his Altar was unique and held the secret of the Jade Buddha; he couldn't allow Mo Xingdao to remain in the flower field indefinitely.</p><p>Once recovered, he would send Mo Xingdao out of the Abyssal Origin, find a suitable place for him, help him recover, and then consider exploring the Altar further.</p><p>"I will follow your instructions."</p><p>Mo Xingdao transformed into human form, bowed politely, and sensing Qin Sang's erratic breathing, understood his urgent need to heal. He said nothing more, entering the private chamber. The stone door closed behind him, sealed by a protective array.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged, Mo Xingdao's gaze was distant, his thoughts swirling.</p><p>He recalled his childhood, the moments of his rise in the Northern Wastelands, his successes and failures.</p><p>He had once been attacked by a mob, yet fought his way to prominence, earning the title of the Northern Wastelands' foremost independent cultivator.</p><p>In all likelihood, he would continue his wandering life, with a slim chance of achieving the Divine Transformation realm.</p><p>Since agreeing to Su Zinan's offer and traveling south by ship, his journey had been one of unexpected opportunity and a complete reshaping of his destiny.</p><p>Trading for the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal, seizing the Spirit-犀 Fruit at Di Shou Mountain, being warned of a looming crisis by two Divine Transformation cultivators, and desperately forcing his way through a Heavenly Tribulation…</p><p>He had always resented being controlled, preferring the life of an independent cultivator, yet he found himself unable to escape his circumstances.</p><p>He had fought desperately, but ultimately, he had reached this point.</p><p>Mo Xingdao thought of Qin Sang outside.</p><p>Even now, the shock lingered.</p><p>He vividly recalled Qin Sang nearly perishing at the hands of the Green Fox Saint King, only to survive and now slay three demons.</p><p>Late Divine Transformation demons had fallen by Qin Sang's hand!</p><p>During the turmoil at the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, their strengths had been relatively equal.  Now, reunited in another realm, the difference between them was as vast as heaven and earth.</p><p>Mo Xingdao felt self-pity and sighed, then roused himself, focusing on cultivating his puppet body.</p><p>The immortal cultivation world is full of infinite mysteries; anything is possible.</p><p>Don't despair until death arrives!</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling,</p><p>the two cultivated in silence. The flower field's protective array shielded them from the outside world. Whatever turmoil the battle caused elsewhere would not reach them.</p><p>Three months later,</p><p>Qin Sang awoke slowly, exhaling a deep breath.</p><p>Examining his internal state, he discovered that the damage from the inner Lion Seal had worsened, affecting his foundation. He had recovered only sixty percent of his strength, but his foundation was no longer in danger and his recovery would now proceed much faster.</p><p>So much time had passed, he still hadn’t properly examined his spoils of war.</p><p>He glanced at the private chamber.  In his cave, he could easily observe Mo Xingdao's every move.</p><p>For all this time, Mo Xingdao had remained motionless, apparently practicing some technique.</p><p>Looking away, Qin Sang opened his Qianjun Ring, revealing several items.</p><p>The most striking were a green jade bead and a deer antler.</p><p>Qin Sang held the green jade bead, probing it with his spiritual sense.  After a moment, he sighed regretfully.</p><p>It required the Tongbao Technique to control it, but the bead lacked any such inscription. Unless he could find someone compatible to trade with, it was useless to him.</p><p>Muttering a word of regret, Qin Sang turned to the deer antler.</p><p>The antler, having been refined by Xia Hou for many years, was, despite some damage, a rare treasure.</p><p>To avoid detection by the Gui Fang Nation and Hong Yuzi, the antler could not be openly displayed and was best used personally.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, his Huifeng Armor having been destroyed; he would need to refine a new set of protective armor.</p><p>But the deer antler, with its sharp edges, was ideal for forging weapons; he might use it to re-forge his gauntlets.</p><p>He would handle the fox and snake corpses similarly.</p><p>Then there were the storage pouches of the snake demon and the Green Fox Saint King.</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King's possessions were less substantial than he had imagined. Qin Sang recalled Mo Xingdao's earlier account of his experiences in the Netherworld.</p><p>Within the Netherworld, the beasts had been disturbed by the heavenly demonic sounds and were rampant, far more dangerous than before, rendering the Five Elements Crown insufficient.</p><p>Especially the final stretch of the ascension path, a treacherous journey where Hui Guang Saint and the Green Fox Saint King had destroyed several precious items. If Mo Xingdao hadn’t shared the burden of the spirit's pressure, the outcome would have been far worse than merely destroying his primary puppet.</p><p>Qin Sang selected useful materials from the two demons' possessions, gaining considerable wealth.</p>
