Chapter 281: Unity Pendant

After seeing off Yu Kong, Qin Sang settled down on a meditation cushion in contemplation.

In Western Desolate Town, especially among cultivators who had been lurking in the vicinity, almost no one believed in the emergence of the Medicine Garden, or the majority were doubtful. They wouldn't mind searching for it after entering, but it would not be their primary objective.

After all, there were still treasures in some important places in Autumn Robin Market, and the low tide period of the protective grand formation would exist briefly. After Autumn Robin Market was closed, it would be very dangerous. No one dared to stay inside for 30 years.

Rather than spending effort searching for the elusive Medicine Garden, it would be better to focus on competing for the visible treasures.

If it were not for the jade pendant shown by the Wandering Cultivator, Qin Sang would not have been able to help doubting its authenticity.

The jade pendant's scene was shown to the Wandering Cultivator by Ge Yuan, and Ge Yuan's identity was somewhat special.

The person who discovered the Medicine Garden was named Shao Chunhui. Ge Yuan was considered as Shao Chunhui's friend. They had worked together several times. They were all people who knew what to give up and what to pursue. The process was quite harmonious without any conflicts, which built up a bit of a trust basis among them.

――――――

Yu Kong and his fellow members did not know about the existence of Ge Yuan.

Before Shao Chunhui's accident, he had once sought out Ge Yuan and showed him this scene, inviting him to search for the spirit medicine together. However, out of prudence, Shao Chunhui had only revealed the tip of the iceberg and did not elaborate further.

Based on the trust built up through several partnerships, Ge Yuan agreed immediately. However, unexpectedly, Shao Chunhui was never heard of again thereafter.

However, Ge Yuan was not the first person to spread the rumor.

Ge Yuan had long forgotten this matter. However, two years ago, when rumors about the Medicine Garden in Autumn Robin Market suddenly spread, it came back to his mind.

After secretly investigating, Ge Yuan suspected that the murderer who killed Shao Chunhui must be one of his companions who entered Autumn Robin Market with him.

He eventually narrowed it down to Yu Kong and his two fellow members.

Only these three men had attempted to return to Autumn Robin Market and were openly recruiting men.

Speaking of avenging Shao Chunhui, Ge Yuan did not have the capability nor the intention. His friendship with Shao Chunhui was not enough to make him sacrifice his life.

Ge Yuan knew that Yu Kong and his two fellow members were all very powerful. No matter which of the three was the murderer, he was no match.

But, Ge Yuan was very interested in the spirit medicine.

The scene shown to him by Shao Chunhui was very tempting. Whether it was the Medicine Garden of an ancient cultivator or the spirit medicine planted by the previous owner of Autumn Robin Market, there was no doubt that it was extremely precious. Even if he only obtained one or two, it would be of great benefit to his cultivation.

Because Ge Yuan was weak and could not ascertain who the murderer was, he decided to stir up the situation and add fuel to the fire, capitalizing on the momentum of the spreading rumors to push the waves.

Rather than letting others quietly pick the spirit medicine, it would be better to create a big fuss. Perhaps he might get a chance to fish in troubled waters.

Unfortunately, Ge Yuan's actions were imprudent. As soon as he started his moves, he almost exposed his tracks. Fortunately, at that critical moment, the Wandering Cultivator happened to come by and saved Ge Yuan's life.

After understanding the cause and effect, the Wandering Cultivator stopped Ge Yuan's crude plan. After all, the number of masters entering Autumn Robin Market was too numerous. If the Medicine Garden was exposed, those spirit medicines would certainly not be enough to share.

In the end, they decided to infiltrate the three men's subordinates separately and figure out the location of the secret passage. As long as they could get themselves inside, they would definitely get a piece of the pie.

Ge Yuan stayed in Western Desolate Town to observe the situation while the Wandering Cultivator returned to Suspended Cranium Pass and invited Qin Sang.

……

Ten days later.

Qin Sang went out early in the morning again and ran into Yu Kong.

Yu Kong had yet to gather enough men to practice the formation. Qin Sang had been going out almost every day recently to inquire in Western Desolate Town. Sometimes, he sat blankly in a teahouse for a whole day. Sometimes, he frequented various shops, using spirit stones to buy information.

Yu Kong had grown accustomed to it and did not urge Qin Sang to respond to his invitation.

"Daoist Fellow has been rushing around all day, long. I wonder if you have found out any news?" Yu Kong asked with pretended curiosity. However, there was a hint of a confident smile on the corner of his mouth, clearly certain that Qin Sang could not have achieved anything.

Qin Sang gave a dry laugh and cupped his hands. "It's okay, it's okay..."

Watching Qin Sang leave, Yu Kong shook his head with a slight laugh.

Qin Sang continued to do almost the same as before. When he passed by an alleyway, his gaze suddenly fixed on it. He walked into the alley calmly, entered a shop casually after passing a shop, and disappeared inside.

The person in the shop was the Wandering Cultivator.

"Senior, why did you request an urgent meeting at this time? Aren't you afraid of exposing your tracks?" Qin Sang asked with a frown and a dissatisfied tone.

He had been very careful and cautious in everything he did to gain Yu Kong's trust. Meeting at this time was extremely risky.

"Junior Qin, don’t worry, I kept following you along the way. No one is watching us." Yun Youzi led Qin Sang to the back hall and whispered, "Junior Qin hasn’t met Fellow Daoist Ge yet. Sheng Yuanzi has gathered everyone, and Fellow Daoist Ge is about to leave the Western Wasteland Town. If we delay further, we may not make it in time. I’ll give you the Same-Mind Pendant first."

Apart from Yu Kong, the other two people were Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, both of whom were mid-level Foundation Establishment experts just like Yu Kong.

Ge Yuan had been recruited by Sheng Yuanzi, and it seemed that Yun Youzi had managed to join Luo Xingnan’s team.

In the back hall, Qin Sang saw Ge Yuan for the first time.

This person had a similar appearance to Qin Sang and was quite handsome. His brows carried a trace of arrogance, and Qin Sang observed sharply that when Ge Yuan looked at him, there was a hint of contempt in his eyes.

In the world of immortal cultivation, only strength mattered.

Ge Yuan’s cultivation was even higher than Yun Youzi, similar to Yu Daiyue, and he was not far from breaking through the mid-level Foundation Establishment. If Yun Youzi had not saved his life, he might not have submitted to Yun Youzi.

Qin Sang bowed. "Fellow Daoist Ge, I greet you."

"Greetings."

Ge Yuan nodded casually and eyed Qin Sang up. He warned unceremoniously, "To me, Fellow Daoist’s cultivation is still too shallow. However, Senior Yun Youzi has spoken highly of you, so I guess you won’t let him down?"

As long as he could achieve his goal, Qin Sang didn’t mind Ge Yuan’s contempt and replied with a normal expression, "Don’t worry, Fellow Daoist Ge, I’ll definitely follow Senior’s instructions. If I discover anything, I will inform you two immediately. I will never act on my own."

Ge Yuan only then looked away from Qin Sang and turned to Yun Youzi, "Senior, time’s running out. Let’s distribute the Same-Mind Pendant first."

Yun Youzi nodded and took out three identical ivory pendants.

"These three Same-Mind Pendants were refined from the ivory of the same Sky Net White Elephant. I managed to get them after a lot of searching.

It’s said that the Sky Net White Elephant has the bloodline of the divine beast Ti Ting, so the Same-Mind Pendant also has the ability to communicate and transmit messages. Although we can’t communicate over long distances, it’s enough for the Qiuhong Market.

The three of us will simultaneously drip our blood onto the Same-Mind Pendant. If we discover anything, crush the pendant immediately. Then, the other two will be informed.

The Same-Mind Pendant comes with its unique magic power, and there won’t be any spiritual fluctuation, so it’s impossible for others to discover it.

However, you two must remember, once the Same-Mind Pendant is crushed, it can’t be restored. There’s only one chance, so make sure the information is true. Otherwise, we’d all be wasting our time."
