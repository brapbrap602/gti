<h1>Chapter 986: A Method to Break the Curse</h1><p>Bai, from his hazy memories, had once seen a similar curse, and perhaps knew how to break it.</p><p>He was trying hard to recall, but to no avail.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't sit still; Mou Laomo was rapidly approaching, and they didn't know how much time they had left.</p><p>"Are you sure the fire curse hasn't invaded your primordial spirit...?"</p><p>Bai finally spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he nodded. "Yes, the fire curse has only merged with my physical body."</p><p>Bai had said that once cursed, the cursed person's primordial spirit and physical body would be invaded simultaneously. If one didn't know how to break the curse, it would be extremely difficult to expel it.</p><p>The jade talisman protected Qin Sang again.</p><p>Whenever the curse attacked, Qin Sang could sense the fire curse runes appearing on the surface of his primordial spirit.  The flimsy Yin-Yang armor was ineffective; only the jade Buddha completely blocked the fire curse.</p><p>But that was all.</p><p>The fire curse, like the Heart-Eating Insect Gu that Kuiyin Old Ancestor had refined, couldn't invade the primordial spirit at all, but it clung tightly to it, leaving Qin Sang helpless.</p><p>"That shouldn't be the case..."</p><p>Bai muttered, puzzled. "Didn't you say that the top cultivation techniques in the current world are incomplete?  I guess that guy's curse-casting skills aren't that high! You're lucky; a fire curse merging with the primordial spirit is the most troublesome. With our current strength, it's almost impossible to solve.  Since that's the case, the fire curse isn't unbreakable.  Unfurl your arm; I need to see what kind of curse it is..."</p><p>Bai separated a strand of his soul, emerging from the corpse puppet bag and landing on Qin Sang's right arm.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill run through his arm.</p><p>Suddenly, the fire curse flared up again.</p><p>"He's still some distance away! I'll try to break the curse. Don't get distracted; use your escape techniques to the fullest and buy as much time as possible. Breaking the curse won't be a matter of a day or two, especially since the person who cast it is far more powerful than we are, making it even harder."</p><p>Bai reminded him.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened upon hearing this.  After a slight nod, he released control of his arm.</p><p>He had been distracted trying to suppress the fire curse.</p><p>Leaving the fire curse to Bai, Qin Sang changed his hand seals, the image of a dragon coiled around him, and his ebony sword flashed out, the spiritual sword circling his body.</p><p>A thunderous sound echoed.</p><p>Qin Sang simultaneously used three top-tier escape techniques.  With a flap of his wings, he didn't say a word, transforming into a three-colored rainbow light and breaking through the air.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang's consciousness entered the Qianjun Ring, selecting all the elixirs and spiritual medicines that could restore his true essence, including the remaining Three-Light Jade Liquid and those few high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>Seeing the Three-Light Jade Liquid, Qin Sang sighed. He hadn't expected to have to use it again so soon after consuming a drop just now to escape.</p><p>Consuming too many pills to restore true essence, or directly absorbing the spiritual energy of spirit stones, would accumulate impurities in the body.  If consumed too quickly, the impurities couldn't be refined and would accumulate, causing true essence chaos and the collapse of the Qi Sea.</p><p>Bai's words made him realize this would be a protracted battle.</p><p>His opponent's true essence was incredibly abundant, while his consumption was extremely fast while maintaining these three escape techniques; he had to continuously supplement it with external force, without time to meditate and recover.</p><p>Once it came to that, only the Three-Light Jade Liquid could save him.</p><p>The Gathering Spirit Bowl gathered the essence of heaven and earth, transforming it into jade liquid, nourishing the origin; the Three-Light Jade Liquid involved the origin level and was the purest power, without those hidden worries.</p><p>The sea was vast and boundless.</p><p>Qin Sang set his sights on a direction, not daring to stop for a moment.</p><p>Mou Laomo pursued relentlessly.</p><p>He periodically activated the fire curse to prevent his prey from changing direction.</p><p>To his surprise, his prey had somehow increased its speed significantly from the beginning. This speed wasn't something a Nascent Soul stage cultivator should be able to achieve.</p><p>However, the gap in cultivation between them was too great. No matter how fast his prey was, it couldn't compare to him.</p><p>If he couldn't even catch prey that was cursed, he might as well just bang his head against a wall.</p><p>Mou Laomo looked ahead, his expression supremely confident.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>In a blink of an eye, dusk had arrived.</p><p>One chasing, one fleeing, a whole day had passed.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't calculate how far he had flown; he only knew that no matter how hard he tried to escape, the fluctuations of the fire curse becoming stronger with each attack.</p><p>The distance between them was gradually narrowing.</p><p>Qin Sang now held a high-grade spirit stone, flying and absorbing the spiritual energy within to replenish his true essence.  The spiritual energy in a high-grade spirit stone was far purer than that of a mid-grade one, causing far fewer hidden problems when directly absorbed, allowing him to hold on a little longer.</p><p>In this situation, even a moment was precious.</p><p>He had previously killed several Black Serpent Mountain disciples, obtaining several high-grade spirit stones.  He'd also acquired two from the deputy commander he killed on Great Island;  it was enough.</p><p>He clutched the spirit stones in one hand, glancing occasionally at his other arm.</p><p>Bai's spirit was diligently analyzing the fire curse runes, remaining silent.  The result was unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not disturb Bai.</p><p>He looked ahead.</p><p>Continuing north, they were drawing closer to Heavenly Dao Sect. If he could reach it, perhaps he could rely on Elder Qingzhu's connections to seek protection from the Ning surname sword cultivator.</p><p>Calculating the time, Qin Sang sighed softly, abandoning the fantasy.  While Heavenly Dao Sect wasn't as remote as the Rain-Swept Lands, getting there from here would take nearly a month—Mu Lao Mo would catch up long before then.</p><p>Just then, Bai's spirit manifested on his arm, translucent and ethereal.</p><p>But what made Qin Sang's heart sink was that Bai's expression showed no relief.</p><p>"I remember you said that the Winter’s Nether Flame fears demonic fire; you once refined it into a fire pearl. Now, separate a strand…"</p><p>Bai said gravely.</p><p>"Right!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  Dividing his attention slowed his escape, so he only summoned a demonic banner to lessen the burden.</p><p>A clump of Nine Nether Demonic Fire emerged from the banner.</p><p>Qin Sang guided the demonic fire towards his arm; under his control, it was as responsive as an extension of himself, allowing Bai to also manipulate it.</p><p>Seeing Bai's actions, Qin Sang felt extremely tense.</p><p>He had tried many times before, attempting to use the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to dispel the fire curse.</p><p>The curse seemed to fear the demonic fire slightly, but Qin Sang couldn't introduce the demonic fire into his body; it only forced the curse deeper.  Even enveloping himself in the Nine Nether Demonic Fire didn't stop the curse's surges.</p><p>Bai 'grabbed' a strand of demonic fire and stared at Qin Sang's arm.</p><p>After a moment, Bai suddenly cast a series of hand seals at the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened; he suppressed the demonic fire with all his might to prevent backlash and failure.</p><p>With their cooperation, the demonic fire was remarkably docile, absorbing the power of the hand seals.</p><p>Under Bai's manipulation, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's form gradually changed;  threads of flame separated from the mass, twisting and contorting.</p><p>Finally, the entire mass of demonic fire vanished, leaving only a chaotic tangle of fire lines.</p>
