<h1>Chapter 921: The Mark</h1><p>Chapter 921: The Mark</p><p>Continuing to use secret techniques, he dispelled the demonic obsession of his external avatar.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang opened his palm, revealing numerous jade slips enveloped in flowing light, arranged before him.  These were various corpse refinement techniques he had collected over time. He had only glanced at them before; now, he intended to carefully study them.</p><p>A month later, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the row of jade slips before him, his expression slightly puzzled.</p><p>“I’ve gathered quite a few corpse refinement techniques over the years, encompassing various schools of thought, yet none share anything in common with the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*. Is the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* too unique, forging a path unprecedented and unparalleled, or am I searching in the wrong direction? Could it be that the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* isn't simply a corpse cultivation inheritance…”</p><p>Qin Sang tapped a jade slip lightly, pondered for a moment, then stood up. He surveyed his cave dwelling. This place, where he had cultivated in seclusion for over thirty years, felt so familiar.  Not only had his strength visibly improved over these years, but this time of undisturbed cultivation was also a precious memory.</p><p>Now, it was time to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, storing the items in his cave dwelling into his storage ring.  At this moment, his external avatar also awoke from its meditative state.  After Qin Sang’s continuous use of secret techniques to resolve the demonic influence, the demonic soul temporarily stabilized and returned to normal.</p><p>The external avatar pointed a finger at the black coffin. A series of ‘click’ sounds echoed as the black coffin shattered into several pieces. After transforming in the air, the pieces reassembled into a seamless black armor, which the avatar donned. Then, a protective aura flickered, concealing the armor beneath its outer robe. The avatar's eyes shifted to Qin Sang's main body.</p><p>A smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.  Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly felt something, lowering his head to look at the spirit beast pouch at his waist.</p><p>The fat silkworm had awakened.</p><p>“This guy again, it’s eaten another piece of purple crystal.  Since breaking through to the mid-stage of the third transformation, it eats faster and faster. The purple crystals are almost gone. I’ll have to gather some more at the Seven Killing Hall on this trip, I wonder if its owner has changed…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>Both the fat silkworm and the sky-eyed butterfly had broken through to the mid-stage of the third transformation, though the sky-eyed butterfly’s cultivation speed was much slower than the silkworm’s.</p><p>He didn’t know the origin of the purple crystal, but the silkworm ate and slept, its cultivation speed exceeding Qin Sang’s expectations.  However, these two little guys hadn't changed much since their breakthrough, perhaps their abilities would be more powerful.</p><p>After feeding the fat silkworm a small piece of purple crystal, Qin Sang left the cave dwelling.  He activated the restriction with his spiritual sense, awakening Bai Zhongqiu and the others.</p><p>“May I ask, senior, what are your instructions?”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife hurried out of the cave.  Simultaneously, a fluctuation in the miasma outside was felt. Bai Ying’er and the two-headed…? seemed to sense something, clinging tightly to the two-headed…?, her brows furrowed, her lips pursed, nervously watching Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade bottle and tossed it to Bai Zhongqiu. Inside were two oddly colored pills.</p><p>The moment he saw the pills, Bai Zhongqiu's eyes were fixated, his excitement uncontainable.</p><p>“Over the years, you two have been diligent in your work.  I previously promised you two Demonic煞 pills, and I will naturally keep my word. These two I obtained unintentionally in the past. The demonic煞 energy within has been carefully refined, considered top-grade Demonic煞 pills,” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>“Thank you for your generosity, senior. We are eternally grateful!”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife were overjoyed. Although they had some savings, it would be very difficult to obtain such high-grade Demonic煞 pills.  High-grade pills had more refined potency, with less residual demonic煞 energy, greatly increasing their chances of forming golden cores.</p><p>After their joy subsided, Bai Zhongqiu suddenly realized something and softly asked, “Senior, you’re now…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. “Since you know I purchased the Seven Killing Hall jade talisman, you must have guessed it. This poisonous island was just a temporary cave dwelling I chose. The Seven Killing Hall will open in a few years, it’s time for me to leave and prepare to enter the Seven Killing Hall. Ying’er has been by my side for many years, and she has always managed the cave dwelling. While I have no intention of taking on disciples, there is some bond between us.  I’ll leave this place to her. In your future actions, don't be too conspicuous, it will be difficult for others to discover the island's secrets. This jade slip contains the methods to control the island's illusionary array and restrictions…”</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, and the jade slip flew towards Bai Ying’er.</p><p>Bai Ying'er clutched the jade slip tightly, her eyes suddenly reddening.  She knelt, "Senior, though you may not acknowledge me, I've received your guidance many times and always considered you my teacher…"</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife looked at their daughter, their hearts filled with mixed emotions.</p><p>In the past, they had trembled before Qin Sang. Over the years, they'd come to understand that encountering him had been their family's greatest fortune.</p><p>"Senior, will you return?  Let me watch over your cave…" Bai Zhongqiu's words held genuine sincerity.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, slowly shaking his head. "You've surely heard of the Seven Kills Hall. My journey ahead is uncertain; whether I live or die is unknown.  It's too early to talk about the future. Besides, this island's spirit veins are barely satisfactory, and it's so remote…"</p><p>His words implied they might never meet again.</p><p>Qin Sang, accustomed to parting, remained composed. He turned towards the two-headed creature and prepared to leave.  The two-headed creature turned to look at Bai Ying'er.  Bai Ying'er's face was filled with reluctance; her tears flowed uncontrollably, and she sobbed.</p><p>Left on the Poison Island to cultivate, she hadn't seen outsiders for years. The two-headed creature was her only friend. This parting was uncertain when they would meet again.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Bai Zhongqiu and his wife, turning to leave. But the two-headed creature let out a low moan, leaping before Bai Ying'er.  A bright green light suddenly emanated from its body, and a green phantom detached itself.</p><p>The phantom rapidly shrunk, becoming no larger than a fingernail, before settling on Bai Ying'er's hand.</p><p>The green light subsided, the phantom vanished, leaving a tattoo-like mark on her hand.</p><p>After this, the two-headed creature appeared much weaker, returning to Qin Sang's side, seemingly drowsy.</p><p>Qin Sang looked surprised, glancing at the two-headed creature.  To the bewildered Bai Ying'er and the others, he said, "It’s weakened itself to give you this protective measure.  When facing a strong enemy, activate the mark's power with your spiritual sense; it can protect you once. Even a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, caught off guard, would suffer a significant loss.”</p><p>Hearing this, Bai Zhongqiu and his wife were overjoyed, urging Bai Ying'er, "Ying'er, quickly thank the… the senior!"</p><p>In the next instant, everything blurred before their eyes.</p><p>Toxic miasma billowed, and Qin Sang and the two-headed creature vanished without a trace.</p>
