<h1>Chapter 1647: Demonic Taint</h1><p>A ten-thousand-year Bodhi tree still stands.</p><p>Its canopy, elegant and vast, provides ample shade.</p><p>A meditation chamber, a small courtyard, serene, solitary.</p><p>The bhikkhunis of the Veiled Moon Convent stood solemnly before the courtyard, seemingly experiencing the state of mind of their ancestral founder.</p><p>This place was once the ancestral founder's cultivation grounds.</p><p>Back then, after her Dao companion ascended during the eastward crossing at the Deity Transformation stage, the founder, unable to bear the pain of separation, had already begun studying Buddhist Dharma before becoming a nun. The Formless Immortal Sect specifically established this pure land within their sect for her.</p><p>Even after she established her own sect, the Veiled Moon Convent, this meditation courtyard remained.</p><p>The teleportation formation leading to the old site of the Veiled Moon Convent was not far from the courtyard.</p><p>They found the old site, but unexpectedly, the Veiled Moon Convent was also affected by the devastating war, suffering severe damage. After such a long time, it took them a great deal of effort to determine the location of the convent.</p><p>Fortunately, the teleportation formation was still intact, and all the nuns entered.</p><p>The elder nun, with respectful demeanor, apologized before pushing the door open.  Inside, the furnishings were exceedingly simple, with only a meditation cushion and no relics of the founder.</p><p>Seeing this, the elder nun led the others in paying their respects to the founder before exiting.  Their primary objective was to seek opportunities within the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>“What a magnificent immortal abode!”</p><p>A young nun couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p>The others, gazing at the towering peaks and the layers of immortal restrictions protecting the legacy, were equally awestruck, deeply agreeing with her.</p><p>“Master, the Formless Immortal Sect is so vast, where should we go first?”</p><p>The young nun asked the elder.</p><p>The elder nun led them to climb a nearby peak, surveying the terrain of the Formless Immortal Sect.  After a moment of contemplation, she said, "The Formless Immortal Sect is centered around its Five Branches, with Emperor Bestowal Mountain presiding over them, and the Ancient Immortal Palace.  All hold great opportunities. Our founder cultivated the Water Branch lineage, and her Dao companion was once the master of the Metal Branch. Our Veiled Moon Convent's cultivation techniques and divine abilities are derived from these two branches.”</p><p>“Is the *Taiyuan Metal Diamond Sword Canon* a true inheritance of the Metal Branch?  The convent lacks the last three scrolls. Could we find them here?” The young nun's face lit up with excitement.</p><p>"Indeed. The Metal Branch specializes in offensive techniques, particularly swordsmanship. The immortal mountain where the Metal Branch Hall was located was known as the sacred ground for sword cultivators in the Central Continent. Bound by an oath, our founder could only pass down the first six scrolls of the sword canon to the Veiled Moon Convent. The last three scrolls are the Metal Branch Hall's most closely guarded secrets.”</p><p>The elder nun recounted the origins of their cultivation techniques and divine abilities with great familiarity.</p><p>The young nun, whose primary cultivation focused on this sword canon, was overjoyed upon hearing this and strongly advocated for going to the Metal Branch Hall first.</p><p>However, there were also fellow nuns present who cultivated the Water Branch techniques.</p><p>Naturally, most of them hoped to find the entrance to the Ancient Immortal Palace first, including Liuli.</p><p>She pondered the rumor the elder nun had mentioned earlier, that the Formless Immortal Sect once controlled an Ancient Immortal Palace!</p><p>"The Central Continent Immortal Palace… is it related to the Violet Firmament Palace that took Master away?”</p><p>Rare ripples of emotion stirred within Liuli's thoughts.</p><p>Simultaneously, the image of a person surfaced in her mind. She remembered Qin Sang mentioning to her that he had another purpose in coming to the Central Continent, which was also to search for the Immortal Palace and gather a crucial cultivation technique.</p><p>Their paths, though different, seemed to converge on this goal.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn't know where the Immortal Palace was.</p><p>Moreover, since parting in the Western Desert, many years had passed. The situation was sudden, and she couldn't contact him in time.</p><p>Liuli's delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p>Unable to reach a consensus, someone suggested splitting up, but the elder nun vetoed the idea. “We've spent too much time searching for the convent. Those at the entrance should soon find a way to pass through the cloud wall.  Besides, we don't know how many powerful cultivators of unknown origin have already entered. It's too dangerous for you to separate!”</p><p>Ultimately, they decided to approach the most prominent landmark, Emperor Bestowal Mountain, first, to assess the situation within the Formless Immortal Sect before deciding on their next move.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the legacy.</p><p>More and more cultivators gathered.</p><p>News of the immortal abode's emergence swept through the Southern Barbarian Continents and spread like wildfire throughout the Central Continent.</p><p>Cultivators from all directions converged here.</p><p>Mount Taiyue was overflowing with people.</p><p>Most cultivators, due to insufficient cultivation, were blocked by the turbulent currents, gazing up at the vortex in the sky.</p><p>As time passed, the power of the turbulent currents within the passage weakened, allowing Golden Core cultivators to withstand the impact and enter the storm.</p><p>However, upon entering, they discovered that the Nascent Soul Grandmasters who had gone in first were blocked by a cloud wall, unable to proceed.  They sighed inwardly, resigned to waiting for the cloud wall to dissipate.</p><p>Gradually, the cloud wall grew denser.</p><p>The clouds, vast as an ocean, filled the entire passage, raging violently.</p><p>After a period of exploration and attempts, the Nascent Soul cultivators finally grasped some patterns.  Except for a few maverick individuals, they began to enter the clouds in groups.</p><p>Inside the sea of clouds.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of azure light pierced through the cloud qi, followed closely by several figures flying out of the sea of clouds.</p><p>The leader was none other than Elder Hua Chenzi of the Taiyue Sect, followed closely by experts from the Taiyue Sect and the Dao Sect.</p><p>“We finally made it in!”</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator at the Eight Desolations stage exclaimed with emotion.  Ascending to the peak at the entrance, he gazed upon the scene within the Formless Immortal Sect, marveling at its profound foundation.</p><p>“Quickly search for Sect Master Guan and Patriarch Yue’s secret marks!”</p><p>The experts of the two sects exchanged brief words and immediately took action.</p><p>Not long after they entered, descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect also entered the sea of clouds in groups.  Subsequently, more and more Nascent Soul cultivators arrived, and the Formless Immortal Sect gradually became lively!</p><p>…</p><p>Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body chose a stone path on the southwest side of Emperor Bestowal Mountain to ascend, taking a different route from Zhu Wudao and the others. He started early and was already nearing the halfway point.</p><p>From the soul search of the Wailing Spirit Cave Master, he learned of their agreement with Zhu Wudao.</p><p>To save his life, Zhu Wudao made a Heart Demon oath.</p><p>If he escaped the Dao Sect's pursuit and survived, they agreed to meet at the foot of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, vowing to lead the two to seek Deity Transformation opportunities.</p><p>However, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xingdao were not ones to be easily fooled. They eventually forced Zhu Wudao to reveal crucial information about the Wordless Jade Tablet and the Five Branch Tokens.</p><p>Even if Zhu Wudao was captured and killed by the Dao Sect, they could still use the Five Branch Tokens to enter Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had no connection with Zhu Wudao and the others and wouldn't bother joining them.</p><p>Coincidentally, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master had been killed by him and couldn't make it to the rendezvous.</p><p>Qin Sang took advantage of the time Zhu Wudao and the others needed, going ahead to verify the function of the Five Branch Tokens. If Zhu Wudao had lied, he could still track them down later.</p><p>Gazing at Emperor Bestowal Mountain from afar, the most prominent feature was the silhouette of ancient temples amidst the mountains.</p><p>Only upon entering the mountain did one realize that there weren't many structures on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The path wound through secluded areas.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended quickly along the stone steps. The scenery along the way was perfectly in harmony with nature, with almost no signs of human intervention except for the stone steps. Not even a single wooden pavilion could be seen.</p><p>Passing through the forest, the scenery suddenly opened up.</p><p>An ornate jade mountain gate, adorned with carved dragons and phoenixes, appeared before him.</p><p>The towering jade gate bore four ancient characters, 'Realm of Cloud Mountains,' exuding an air of timeless elegance.</p><p>Beyond the jade gate was a straight white jade staircase ascending into the clouds. The area was shrouded in mist, ethereal like a celestial realm, its destination unknown.</p><p>Each stone path on Emperor Bestowal Mountain had a similar mountain gate, with different ancient characters inscribed on them, leading to different areas. Each one, however, led to a crucial or forbidden area of the Formless Immortal Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what the 'Realm of Cloud Mountains' was.</p><p>However, Zhu Wudao claimed that the Wordless Jade Tablet was located at the summit of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, reachable from any path. Therefore, there was no need to worry too much.</p><p>Arriving at the mountain gate, Qin Sang paused, his left hand gripping the Wood Branch Token, carefully examining the jade gate and the scene beyond.</p><p>A moment later, a strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. After a moment of contemplation, he summoned the Heaven's Eye Butterfly from his dantian.</p><p>The butterfly's shadow fluttered, landing on Qin Sang's shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang formed hand seals, unexpectedly employing a secret technique of the Witch Clan to stimulate the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's potential.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly spread its wings, remaining motionless. The Heaven's Eye patterns on its wings flowed naturally, emanating a氤氲spiritual light, resembling two true divine eyes, burning brightly.</p><p>It gazed intently at the scene beyond the gate for a long time.</p><p>A look of suspicion gradually appeared on Qin Sang's face. "An illusion?"</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly's divine ability was undoubtedly the nemesis of illusions.</p><p>But Qin Sang's tone lacked confidence.</p><p>The scene beyond the gate seemed like an illusion, yet also seemed to contain elements of reality, confusing the observer's judgment, creating a sense of contradiction and strangeness.</p><p>Qin Sang tightened his grip on the Wood Branch Token and took his first step towards the jade gate.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The surrounding scenery remained unchanged.</p><p>As Qin Sang passed through the jade gate, the light suddenly dimmed, and the mist above abruptly collapsed. White mist cascaded down like a waterfall, resembling a bursting dam, surging towards him with overwhelming force.</p><p>Qin Sang's breath hitched.</p><p>He looked up sharply, but the jade gate had vanished without a trace.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the tide of mist approached, its power astonishing.</p><p>It seemed Qin Sang was about to be engulfed by the mist.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the mist parted at the very moment it touched Qin Sang.</p><p>Spiritual light flashed, and a protective barrier appeared around Qin Sang's body.  He activated the Auspicious Pearl, but it failed to protect him.  It was the Wood Branch Token in his hand that shielded him from the tide of mist!</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his left hand.</p><p>The token emitted a faint green light, very faint.</p><p>He hadn't infused the Wood Branch Token with any true essence.</p><p>In fact, during his journey, Qin Sang had tried several times, but no energy or incantation elicited a response from the Wood Branch Token.</p><p>However, after stepping through the jade gate, the Wood Branch Token suddenly changed.</p><p>The faint green light effortlessly parted the mist, and Qin Sang felt no impact whatsoever.</p><p>He stood still for a moment, the green light persisting.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the white jade staircase, originally ascending straight upwards, had shifted at some point, veering to the right. The surface of the steps also emitted a faint green light, clearly caused by the Wood Branch Token.</p><p>His Heaven's Eye could penetrate the mist, but he couldn't see the end.</p><p>There was only this one path before him.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the staircase and began to ascend.</p><p>His feet felt solid ground.  The white jade steps weren't illusory but real.</p><p>As he ascended, Qin Sang continued to observe the Wood Branch Token.  The green light pulsed rhythmically like breathing, but otherwise remained unchanged.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang increased his pace.</p><p>The length of the white jade staircase defied logic!</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that he had traveled a distance sufficient to reach the summit of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, yet he still couldn't see the end of the staircase.  Clearly, there was a formation at play.</p><p>He continued for an unknown distance.</p><p>Qin Sang's steps faltered slightly. Finally, amidst the sea of mist, he saw something different: an exquisitely crafted three-story jade pavilion!</p><p>…</p><p>At the foot of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The mountain wind rustled through the trees.</p><p>Beneath an ancient tree, two figures suddenly appeared – two Daoists.</p><p>One was a female Daoist. Although she wore Daoist robes, judging by the allure in her eyes, she didn't quite resemble a Dao Sect disciple. The other, a male Daoist wearing a Daoist crown and white robes, held a crimson sword, his tall figure exuding an aura of a true cultivator.</p><p>Both were Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>Looking at the immortal mountain so close at hand, and the ubiquitous immortal phenomena surrounding them, the female Daoist's excitement grew more intense. Then, as if remembering something, she said coquettishly, “Brother, you kept this from me for so long!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist smiled faintly.  “The Dao and Buddhist Sects watch us closely. If our Jade Terrace Sect's identity as descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect were exposed, how could any of us survive? I was merely following ancestral instructions. Since our ancestors, the sect has remained hidden, and this secret was known only to the Sect Master.  I never thought the Formless Immortal Sect would ever see the light of day again!”</p><p>The female Daoist was only feigning anger. The smile on her face couldn't be contained as she giggled. “I never imagined the sect also recorded another passage into the Formless Immortal Sect.  It seems our Jade Terrace Sect isn't just a simple descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect! Let those people wait outside.  The treasures within the immortal mountain belong to our Jade Terrace Sect!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist, however, wasn't so optimistic. His tone grew slightly somber as he warned, “Have you forgotten what those people were discussing?  Before the cloud wall erupted, several powerful cultivators had already entered the immortal abode.  Junior Sister, do not be careless!”</p><p>“What's there to fear? Aren’t they all vying for opportunities in the Immortal Palace?”</p><p>Despite her words, the female Daoist's laughter subsided. She then asked, “Brother, since we’re here, don’t hide it from me any longer! What incredible treasures are within this mountain? Why didn’t you go to the Immortal Palace first, or the Five Branches, but instead came here?”</p><p>“Emperor Bestowal Mountain is the ancestral grounds of the Formless Immortal Sect. You understand its importance, right?  However, what I seek is not the ancestral founder's treasures, but Deity Transformation relics!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist looked up at the summit with anticipation.</p><p>“Deity Transformation relics?”</p><p>The female Daoist was both delighted and startled, but mostly confused. “Didn't you say that the Formless Immortal Sect was destroyed by the betrayal of the Dao and Buddhist Sects, and their top experts were all killed?  How could there be Deity Transformation relics here?”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist observed his surroundings for a moment before leaping towards the nearby stone steps, beckoning the female Daoist to follow.  He explained, “According to the sect’s records, the downfall of the Formless Immortal Sect wasn't solely due to the betrayal of the Dao and Buddhist Sects. The primary factor was that the Formless Immortal Sect had been severely weakened by the Demonic Calamity, with heavy casualties among their top experts. Even those who survived were afflicted by demonic taint, which gave their enemies an opportunity.”</p><p>“Demonic taint?” The female Daoist looked bewildered, as if hearing an incomprehensible tale.</p><p>Before this, she had never heard of these secrets.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist pondered for a moment before saying, “The specifics of demonic taint aren't detailed in the records, and I can’t explain it clearly.  It’s said that the Formless Immortal Sect accidentally released a peerless demonic creature from the Immortal Palace, triggering the Demonic Calamity.  The most terrifying aspect wasn't the demonic creature's strength, but its bizarre method, referred to as demonic taint in the records. Those afflicted by demonic taint would unconsciously lose themselves, transforming into demonic beings. The Formless Immortal Sect’s momentary negligence led to the spread of the demonic taint, which rapidly escalated into a Demonic Calamity, nearly toppling the entire cultivation world!”</p><p>The female Daoist grew more and more horrified as she listened.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist also felt a chill run down his spine. After a pause, he looked up at the summit. “When the Demonic Calamity swept through the cultivation world, it was the Formless Immortal Sect’s golden age.  They paid an unimaginable price to quell the Demonic Calamity and suppress the peerless demonic creature.  However, after the calamity, the surviving experts of the Formless Immortal Sect discovered that they had also been unknowingly afflicted by demonic taint, with demonic intent deeply embedded within them.  Thus, the remaining experts of the Formless Immortal Sect, despite their grave injuries, could only seal themselves within Emperor Bestowal Mountain, intending to use formations and their profound cultivation to dispel the demonic taint.  Once the hidden danger was eliminated, their descendants would awaken them.  Unfortunately… they never awoke.”</p><p>As he spoke, he took out a token. The token was identical in form to the Wood Branch Token, but inscribed with the character ‘Fire’!</p>
