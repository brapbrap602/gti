<h1>Chapter 1966: Fox Cry</h1><p>Green Sheep Tea House.</p><p>Yu Lang, having received news, hurried over.</p><p>“Shi Ge, you’ve left seclusion.”</p><p>“Just mentioned that, it should be Sha Ge,” Xiao Wu chuckled softly, stroking the small white fox lying on his lap.</p><p>Yu Lang poured himself a cup of tea, looking at Sha Jia Yu questioningly.</p><p>Xiao Wu also looked curious.</p><p>“I am originally a descendant of the main Sha family branch. After our family suffered a great upheaval, it was inconvenient for me to reveal my true identity, so I used the alias Shi, deceiving my brothers for so long. You won’t blame me, will you?”</p><p>Sha Jia Yu chuckled self-deprecatingly, sighing, “My parents gave me this name, but it became a prophecy.  A single feather of the Sha family, drifting alone.”</p><p>Yu Lang and Xiao Wu exchanged glances, their expressions turning serious.</p><p>“Every time Big Brother returned to Green Sheep Temple, he would bring delicacies for our senior sister and classic books and martial arts manuals for me. We siblings will always remember this kindness. What does it matter what Big Brother’s real name is? Besides, Big Brother has such a great hardship,” Yu Lang declared resolutely.</p><p>As he spoke, Yu Lang remembered something.</p><p>No wonder when Senior Sister was framed by Meng Yu Su, Sha Ge reacted so violently.</p><p>Bearing such a blood feud, it’s normal to have a strong killing intent.  It’s already extraordinary that Sha Ge didn't become a great demon.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu said with relief, “Speaking of which, I also have to thank Qingfeng Daoist and you. It’s thanks to you that I managed to retain a shred of clarity and didn't completely fall into demonic possession. Every time I returned to Green Sheep Temple, although the stay was very short, it was the most enjoyable time of my life. I could completely relax, chat and laugh with you, and not think about those things.”</p><p>A deep look of remembrance appeared on his face.</p><p>The time spent at Green Sheep Temple, added up, was only a few days. Yet, for him, it was unforgettable.</p><p>Only there did he feel like a real person.</p><p>Xiao Wu bowed slightly, “Big Brother is willing to tell us now, does that mean you have avenged yourself?”</p><p>A strange look flashed across Sha Jia Yu’s face, and he said softly, “The enemy family was the Bai clan of Guanyang Mountain. Half a year ago, the entire clan was annihilated, Guanyang Mountain turned into ruins, not a single survivor was left!”</p><p>Yu Lang was startled.</p><p>No survivors meant that regardless of age or gender, everyone, including ordinary people and side branches, were all killed.</p><p>Every single drop of Bai bloodline was completely eradicated!</p><p>But considering the Sha family's annihilation, the Bai clan's methods were equally ruthless, with only Sha Jia Yu escaping.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu destroying the Bai clan to avenge his family was perfectly justifiable.</p><p>Outsides could not blame him.</p><p>Yu Lang looked Sha Jia Yu up and down.  He was a mortal now, and couldn't tell if Sha Jia Yu was injured.</p><p>At Green Sheep Temple, he had heard Sha Jia Yu assess the major forces near Yan Kingdom, mentioning the Bai clan of Guanyang Mountain. But at that time, Sha Jia Yu's expression and tone were perfectly normal.</p><p>Yu Lang remembered that the Bai clan had three Nascent Soul ancestors!</p><p>Sha Jia Yu was only at the late Golden Core stage before, yet he managed to annihilate the entire Bai clan. Even after successfully entering the Nascent Soul stage, it's impossible to fight three Nascent Soul cultivators alone.</p><p>Just how great a price did Sha Ge pay?</p><p>Should he ask Master for medicine?</p><p>Sha Jia Yu saw through Yu Lang’s thoughts and shook his head, “The enemy clan was destroyed, but unfortunately, it wasn’t me who did it…”</p><p>Listening to Sha Jia Yu recounting the events of half a year ago on Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>Yu Lang opened his mouth, not knowing whether to congratulate Sha Ge or comfort him.</p><p>The annihilation of the enemy clan was certainly worthy of celebration.</p><p>But Sha Ge, burdened by his family's blood feud, lived his life for revenge, yet couldn't kill his enemy himself…</p><p>After being tormented by hatred for two hundred years, without release, everything suddenly became meaningless.</p><p>Yu Lang keenly sensed a lingering gloom in Sha Ge’s eyes.</p><p>If he couldn't let go, it would eventually turn into a heart demon, the most dreaded thing for cultivators.</p><p>Yu Lang worried about Sha Jia Yu, but didn't know how to console him, so he asked, “What are you planning to do next, Sha Ge?”</p><p>“The vast world is boundless. Little Yan Kingdom is just a drop in the ocean. Legend says there are all kinds of magical creatures and treasures in the world.  I want to go and see.”</p><p>Sha Jia Yu stood up, walked to the window, looked at the vast expanse of water outside, and a glimmer of light appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Before this, only hatred filled his heart.</p><p>When he calmed down and began to consider his future, the first thing that came to mind was this, not cultivation.</p><p>Previously, he cultivated diligently for revenge, fueled by hatred, doing everything he could to survive.</p><p>Now, he was lost.</p><p>He couldn't understand. Even if he achieved immortality, what would be the point of living?  Especially since his blood sacrifice to open his meridian had drastically shortened his lifespan, making his chances of reaching the Transformation stage extremely slim.  Fate was cruel.</p><p>If the Guanyang Mountain battle had happened before he opened his meridian, he wouldn't have been driven to this extreme path, fearing the ever-growing power of the Bai clan and the hopelessness of revenge.  With patient cultivation over a hundred years, and the help of a Purple Source Pill, he might have had a chance at normal Nascent Soul cultivation.</p><p>"Good," Yu Lang readily agreed with Sha Da Ge's decision. Traveling the world would broaden his horizons, perhaps leading to an opportunity to resolve his inner conflicts.</p><p>"Before I leave, though, I'll stay for a while to assist you," Sha Jia Yu turned and said.</p><p>"Assist?"</p><p>Yu Lang was startled. He guessed Sha Da Ge must have broken through to the Yuan Ying stage.  He had descended to the mortal world, living among ordinary people, confident in his superior intellect and strategy, and possessing unmatched martial arts skills.  What made him worthy of assistance from a Yuan Ying cultivator?  Perhaps Sha Da Ge was tired of the strife in the cultivation world and wanted to seek tranquility in the mortal realm, like their master. Yu Lang mused.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu said meaningfully, "Brother, haven't you noticed something strange about the mortal world's situation lately?"</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Lang's expression changed instantly. Of course, he had noticed!  While carrying out the emperor's order to suppress the rebellion, he found the rebels' resistance far stronger than anticipated. There were signs of cultivators among the rebels.  However, these cultivators had not directly intervened with their powers, disappearing after the defeat, leaving Yu Lang without clear evidence.  Now, the situation in Yan, Da Liang, and surrounding countries had become increasingly bizarre.</p><p>"What's happening in the cultivation world?"</p><p>Yu Lang already suspected something; Sha Jia Yu's words confirmed his fears. The Bai clan's destruction – was there more to it?</p><p>"I haven't found out exactly what's going on. But over the past six months, traveling through various countries, I've witnessed many illogical events. The cultivation world is showing signs of great chaos. The mortal world isn't just collateral damage; you, having sealed your powers, probably don't know this, but in Yan, the Ghost Gate has been sealed by the Yan gods!"</p><p>Ghost Gate, the gate between the mortal and spirit realms. Closing the Ghost Gate meant the Yan gods would no longer concern themselves with mortal affairs. Even if demons harmed people, they wouldn't intervene. They had abandoned the mortals, forsaken their offerings!</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Yu Lang's face showed his shock.  No wonder he and Tao Teng so easily obtained permission to experience the mortal world.  What was happening?  The Yan gods' action was tantamount to self-destruction, shutting themselves off, as if avoiding a great calamity.</p><p>"It's not just Yan; this chaos is far wider than you and I can imagine."</p><p>Sha Jia Yu's gaze drifted towards the outer regions. His travels had revealed a world turned upside down!</p><p>"Similar things are happening everywhere beyond Yan, in every country, every place.  The cultivation world, the mortal world, the spirit world – no one is untouched. Most gods, like the Yan City God, have ordered the sealing of the Ghost Gate, withdrawing from mortal affairs. But some gods, with conscience, unwilling to let the cultivation world corrupt the mortal world and cause suffering, their fate..."</p><p>Sha Jia Yu sighed, leaving the rest unsaid.  Yu Lang could guess, and he felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>"Why…why?"</p><p>Yu Lang murmured the question, unsure if he was asking Sha Jia Yu or Heaven. He felt a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><p>If it were only Yan, with Sha Da Ge's help, perhaps he could protect the people. The cultivation sects around Yan wouldn't dare offend a Yuan Ying cultivator for the sake of mortals.  But this was a terrifying catastrophe!  He was just a grain of sand in this maelstrom.</p><p>"It's said that from Yun Du Mountain to Mu Luo Mountain, the entire world is in chaos. I worried you were unaware of the situation and might offend someone you shouldn't, so I hurried back."</p><p>Sha Jia Yu paused, seeing Yu Lang's bewildered expression, and said with sorrow, "This isn't a good time to experience the mortal world. You…should return to the mountain."</p><p>He empathized with Yu Lang's feelings.  This torrent had erased his reason for living and would crush Yu Lang's mortal experience.  Even with Yu Lang's talents and dedication, he couldn't stop the calamity.  He and the people of Yan were just ants!</p><p>Return to the mountain, to Qing Yang Temple, to Master Qing Feng. Master Qing Feng was unfathomable; he could surely protect them.</p><p>...</p><p>Sha Jia Yu silently shook his head. Yu Lang's worldly cultivation had ended like this; he wondered if it would affect his temperament, perhaps even leave him with a demon in his heart.</p><p>"Jijiji! Jijiji!"</p><p>Suddenly, the little white fox on Xiao Wu's lap cried out anxiously.</p><p>Xiao Wu explained, "It's asking if the Yao race will be involved."</p><p>"Whether human or Yao, no one can stay out of this," Sha Jia Yu said firmly.</p><p>The little white fox's eyes immediately reddened.  Its two front paws gripped Xiao Wu's lapel tightly, letting out urgent cries, "Yingyingying..."</p><p>Xiao Wu reached out to stroke the little fox's head, gently soothing it, and said, "I know."</p><p>She looked north.</p><p>North, to Bei Kuo County, Yu Bai Temple.</p><p>Years ago, she had followed Qin Sang down the mountain, crossed the desert, and arrived in the Southern Country. Bei Kuo County was the first place she reached.</p><p>In Bei Kuo County...</p><p>She met her first friend, Chen Ya'er.</p><p>She helped a kind willow spirit attain godhood.</p><p>She witnessed for the first time a good person being taken by gods and spirits after death, entering the divine path.</p><p>She assisted the local gods of Bei Kuo County in capturing a demonic leader from Yu Bai Temple, and rescued a group of white foxes controlled by the demon.</p><p>The bloodline of that group of foxes was close to this little white fox!</p><p>At the Lei Xiao Sect ruins, the little white fox, though still young, remembered its master's conversation with Xiao Wu.</p><p>Once it gained some cultivation and intelligence, the little fox descended the mountain to search for them, hoping to ask where its family was.</p><p>Unfortunately, Xiao Wu and her master had long since left.</p><p>The little fox went through many hardships but couldn't find Xiao Wu. Luckily, as it wandered, it left Yan and sensed Xiao Wu, leading to their reunion.</p><p>Knowing her family might be in danger, the little fox couldn't help but beg.</p><p>An image flashed through Xiao Wu's mind.</p><p>In the image, there was a boat, two generations of a family, and a child named Chen Ya'er.</p><p>'Dong! Dong! Dong!'</p><p>She seemed to hear the sound of a clear drum.</p><p>'Shua!'</p><p>Xiao Wu's body trembled, her hair swaying without a breeze.  The seal on her was broken.</p><p>Yu Lang was still in a daze, looking blankly at his senior sister.</p><p>But he saw Xiao Wu raise her hand, a gust of wind sweeping the three people in the room, and with a flash, they appeared outside Yan's capital city.</p><p>Yu Lang hadn't realized it yet.</p><p>But Sha Jia Yu's eyes widened in shock.</p><p>He was already a Yuan Ying cultivator, and he practiced demonic arts, making him more powerful than his peers.</p><p>Just now, he had been swept away by Xiao Wu, taken out of the capital, and had been unable to react, unable to do anything.</p><p>In a flash, he found himself in mid-air.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Sha Jia Yu's eyes widened like copper bells, his disbelief evident.</p><p>He had always thought that Xiao Wu's cultivation was not much higher than Yu Lang's, as they were siblings in their sect.</p><p>'Sou!'</p><p>Xiao Wu took them all, escaping at light speed.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu stared blankly below; mountains, rivers and cities receded with an incomprehensible speed, and in a blink of an eye, they were outside of Yan.</p><p>Yu Lang finally came to his senses.  Forgetting his shock, he was most worried about his senior sister's current state. Something was wrong.</p><p>"Senior sister, where are we going?"</p><p>Xiao Wu didn't answer, her lips pressed tightly together. She had a bad feeling.</p><p>...</p><p>Qing Yang Temple.</p><p>The moment Xiao Wu flew out of the capital city...</p><p>A Daoist appeared in the temple.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the courtyard, hands behind his back, looking silently at the north.</p><p>...</p><p>Xiao Wu's speed was like lightning, flying north as fast as possible, but not forgetting to conceal her presence.</p><p>Along the way, scenes below flashed constantly before their eyes.</p><p>Some places remained peaceful and harmonious.</p><p>Many places, however, had already become ruins, devastated.</p><p>The battles between cultivators, the wars between countries, were happening all the time.</p><p>Even more heartbreaking was that in some places, the presence of the divine path could no longer be sensed.</p><p>Xiao Wu did not stop for a moment.</p><p>She flew over Ji State, continuing north, and saw the familiar Fu Chun River.</p><p>They were getting closer and closer to Bei Kuo County.</p><p>Yet, she subconsciously slowed down.</p><p>Finally, they saw the county below.</p><p>"Alas!"</p><p>Sha Jia Yu sighed.</p><p>Bei Kuo County was in ruins, smoke billowing, and even from the sky, they could smell the acrid smoke, mixed with the strong smell of blood and corpses.</p><p>"Jijiji!"</p><p>The white fox suddenly cried out, leaping from Xiao Wu's arms, jumping to a depression north of the county.</p><p>In the depression, there was an abandoned temple.</p><p>A fierce battle had clearly taken place there. The halls and walls had collapsed, only the temple gate still stood.</p><p>On the door frame, hung clumps of bloody flesh, emitting a foul stench.</p><p>The outline of foxes could be vaguely seen, all skinned.</p><p>Xiao Wu landed by the river outside the county, paused for a moment, then carefully entered the county and came to a collapsed house.</p><p>She stood there.</p><p>Looking at the dark red bloodstains beneath the bricks and rubble.</p><p>"Wuwuwu..."</p><p>The sound of foxes wailing came from the mountains.</p><p>'Dong! Dong! Dong!'</p><p>In the ruined Bei Kuo County, a drum beat echoed.</p><p>It was the sound of a clapper drum.</p><p>Muffled, desolate, and mournful. </p>
