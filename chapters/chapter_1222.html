<h1>Chapter 1214: Trapped Spirit</h1><p>The path ahead was uncertain, and the Snake King couldn't help but feel a little worried.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang moving with practiced ease through the dark clouds, clearly very familiar with this place and not appearing to have just infiltrated the Abyssal Ruins, he gradually felt reassured.</p><p>Although the malevolent spirit was powerful, without the interference of Abyssal cultivators, Qin Sang and the Snake King together still had the means to protect themselves.  Escaping it, however, would take time.</p><p>Locked onto by the malevolent spirit, Qin Sang and the Snake King were unable to conceal their presence or their tracks. Their only option was to flee as quickly as possible towards the spirit-trapping location Qin Sang had chosen.</p><p>As they burst out of the flag formation, Han Xi and Old Man Ye exchanged several blows in an instant, finally, Xue Zhu's icy energy pierced through the blood, like a sharp sword.</p><p>"Old Man Ye…"</p><p>Jiang Chenzi and the other two failed to stop Qin Sang and the Snake King, looking quite flustered.</p><p>Their expressions were somewhat sheepish, given the circumstances.</p><p>They had a three-to-two advantage, with the malevolent spirit assisting and a pre-prepared flag formation – a clear advantage, yet they still let their opponents escape.</p><p>"They won't escape the malevolent spirit easily. Let's go capture them."</p><p>The three were about to set off, hoping to make amends for their failure.</p><p>"No need! Han Xi and Old Man Lu are both at the end of their strength. The two cultivators at the Abyssal Ruins entrance will surely deal a heavy blow to them. Leave this to you."</p><p>Old Man Ye stopped pursuing, giving instructions to Jiang Chenzi and the others.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi was startled, "Then the Snake King…"</p><p>"I will personally deal with them! I heard that Daoist Pei perished in the Sky Traverse Plateau, killed by a demon king wielding fire banners and thunder techniques. That should be the Bright Moon Demon King, right? Old Man Lu is holed up in the desert, content with his secluded life. The Snake King is nothing to worry about. That Bright Moon Demon King, however, is formidable. He already possesses such strength; his potential is unparalleled in my experience, and he will surely be a major threat in the future."</p><p>Pausing, Old Man Ye glanced at the blood lake and continued, "I just barely managed to suppress the blood lake using a secret technique. If the blood lake were to backfire, you must stall for time, so as not to undo all our efforts."</p><p>Upon hearing Old Man Ye mention the blood lake, Jiang Chenzi and the others looked serious, immediately nodding in agreement.  It seemed the blood lake was far more important than pursuing Qin Sang and the Snake King.</p><p>A mental exchange took only a moment. Old Man Ye cast several restrictive seals towards the blood lake before sensing the malevolent spirit's trail and transforming into a crimson遁光, swiftly pursuing.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi and the other two remained behind.</p><p>One stayed to guard the blood lake, while the other two vanished underground.</p><p>In the distance…</p><p>Dark clouds stretched as far as the eye could see, ancient prohibitions extending endlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Snake King fought and retreated, making their way through the gaps. Soon, they sensed a powerful presence rapidly approaching from behind.</p><p>"Old Man Ye is pursuing us personally!"</p><p>The Snake King's expression changed.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Old Man Ye to abandon Han Xi and the others, choosing instead to hunt them.</p><p>He didn't panic, however.  His gaze pierced through the dark clouds, spotting several blurry mountain silhouettes in the distance. He sent a message to the Snake King, proceeding as planned, "Ahead is one of the spirit-trapping locations I mentioned earlier. It's more dangerous than the others, but we must shake off the malevolent spirit quickly.  Daoist friend, help me lure it into the ancient prohibition!"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The Snake King's expression turned serious, his voice low.</p><p>He opened his mouth, exhaling a cloud of demonic energy, revealing his true form. His appearance wasn't drastically different; he merely had an added layer of blue scales.  This showed that he wasn't intentionally transforming into a half-human, half-snake form – his true form was just that – his bloodline was truly unique.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A blue orb grazed Qin Sang, disappearing into a dark cloud, exploding within.</p><p>The dark clouds shifted; the ancient prohibitions were triggered and retaliated automatically, launching waves of blue light. The attack was indiscriminate, targeting not only the malevolent spirit, but also Qin Sang and the Snake King.</p><p>The Snake King shielded Qin Sang with clouds of demonic energy.</p><p>Qin Sang dodged and weaved, navigating through the gaps. The malevolent spirit, however, remained unfazed.  As the blue light struck it, the beams wrapped around it like ropes, only to be forcibly dispersed by the spirit.</p><p>They flew onward, the mountain silhouettes growing clearer.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings and located a flaw in the ancient prohibition he had noticed earlier; thankfully, it remained unchanged.</p><p>He darted into the dark cloud.</p><p>The malevolent spirit relentlessly followed, charging into the cloud behind him.</p><p>The moment they entered the dark cloud, Qin Sang felt the surrounding space become abnormally profound.  What he saw before him was a boundless void and countless brilliant stars, as if they had arrived in deep space.</p><p>There was nothingness above, below, and all around.</p><p>Stars shone, each seemingly within reach, yet impossibly distant, making it impossible to determine if they were real or illusions.  Even the Sky-Eyed Butterfly couldn't penetrate the illusion.</p><p>He felt adrift, overwhelmed by infinite loneliness.</p><p>Feeling the power of the ancient restriction, Qin Sang was secretly startled.  Even weakened by the passage of time, if he hadn't spotted the flaw before entering, he and the evil spirit would have been trapped together, requiring considerable effort to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped abruptly, afraid to move lest he disturb the ancient restriction.</p><p>Then, his back tensed. He knew the evil spirit's attack had followed.  He quickly activated the ebony sword, slashing horizontally to his left.</p><p>The sword light shimmered, seemingly striking nothing substantial.  The void subtly vibrated; the stars, like reflections in water, swayed.  A void fissure opened to Qin Sang's left. Without hesitation, he leaped inside.</p><p>Void vanished.</p><p>Reality returned.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the void, secretly relieved. Then he saw a raging storm in the dark clouds; the evil spirit was struggling fiercely, turning to flee.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>As soon as he appeared, Qin Sang heard a dull thud and saw the Serpent King sent flying.</p><p>While Qin Sang lured the evil spirit into the trap, Ye Laomo pursued, only to be blocked by the Serpent King.</p><p>Seeing the Serpent King's bleeding mouth and numerous fallen scales, Qin Sang was startled. In such a short time, the Serpent King was already showing signs of defeat.  Ye Laomo's strength was beyond imagination.</p><p>Without a word, Qin Sang used the ebony sword to attack Ye Laomo.</p><p>Ye Laomo, about to press his advantage, felt a sudden darkness before him, recognizing the sword formation Qin Sang had just used.</p><p>The evil spirit was hindered by the sword array.  He dared not be careless, flipping his palm to send a blood wheel spinning above his head.  A rain of blood droplets fell like crimson tassels, the smell of blood overpowering.</p><p>“Bloodline techniques and treasures…could it be something like the ‘Seed of the Demon Fetus’—a blood-cultivated avatar?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The surrounding space was hazy; countless gray threads within the sword formation attacked Ye Laomo.</p><p>“The evil spirit is trapped. Go!”</p><p>Having landed a blow, Qin Sang immediately signaled the Serpent King to flee, showing no intention of fighting Ye Laomo.  It was best to escape, unsure how long it would take the evil spirit to break free.</p><p>The Serpent King finally caught his breath, his expression relaxing slightly. He glanced back at Ye Laomo, remembering the feeling of helplessness, and was terrified.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>Ye Laomo broke through the sword array, watching the fleeing pair with a slight frown.  Their single-minded escape in that direction suggested another escape route, deep within the Abyssal Ruins, a place even the Abyssal Cultivators dared not venture easily.</p>
