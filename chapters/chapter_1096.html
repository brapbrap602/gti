<h1>Chapter 1888: The Wu Cannot Be Without Their High Priestess</h1><p>The Withered Leaf Cicada was completely drained of its vital essence.</p><p>Old Devil Fang, with the help of the Star-Winged Cicada's rebirth, had managed to escape.</p><p>It was unknown what divine power the Star-Winged Cicada possessed, but it had surprisingly pierced through the crimson crystalline wall.</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment wasn't about to let Old Devil Fang get away. Its figure flickered repeatedly as it lunged forward.</p><p>Anxiety filled the eyes of the Star-Winged Cicada.</p><p>Old Devil Fang's primordial spirit had suffered severe damage. Even after transferring into the Star-Winged Cicada's body and absorbing the Withered Leaf Cicada's essence, he barely managed to break through the crimson crystalline wall.</p><p>Just then, Old Devil Fang witnessed a scene he would never forget.</p><p>A delicate figure suddenly leaped up – it was the High Priestess – placing herself between him and the Ancient Devil's soul fragment.</p><p>"The Wu cannot be without their High Priestess!"</p><p>The High Priestess gave a tragic smile, leaving behind these parting words.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Spring Thunder Silkworm illusion shattered. A silver spark glimmered on the High Priestess's forehead – her last flicker of life.</p><p>In an instant, countless thunder threads filled the sky, striking back at the Ancient Devil's soul fragment.</p><p>The Spring Thunder Silkworm perished, and the thunder threads finally faded.</p><p>She knew Old Devil Fang wasn't someone worthy of entrusting the entire tribe to, yet she still chose to sacrifice herself, granting him a chance at survival.</p><p>The Wu were far inferior to the Humans.</p><p>Even if Spiritual Pearl and the others perished here, the foundation of the Human race would remain. The Wu, however, would be severely weakened, left leaderless.</p><p>The knowledge gained from the ancient rune restrictions needed to be brought out by someone if there was to be any hope for the Wu's revival.</p><p>Countless thunderbolts blocked the path.</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment snorted coldly, unleashing its true demonic energy. It attempted to forcefully disperse the thunderbolts and capture Old Devil Fang.</p><p>At this moment, it understood the frustration Mo Qingzhu had felt earlier.</p><p>Qingzhu's main body once again vibrated the spirit sword fragments, stubbornly resisting. Moreover, due to the Ancient Devil's soul fragment using the Splitting Origin Slash, its power had diminished, making it increasingly difficult to suppress Qingzhu's main body.</p><p>Caught off guard, the Ancient Devil's true demonic energy fluctuated, almost getting engulfed by the thunderbolts.</p><p>A furious growl rumbled from its throat. It had no choice but to give up the pursuit and forcefully suppress Qingzhu. Transforming its true demonic energy into a curtain, it endured the thunderbolts' attack at all costs and retrieved the nearly extinguished High Priestess.</p><p>The High Priestess, eyes closed in death, was placed into the blood coffin.</p><p>By then, Old Devil Fang had already passed through the crimson crystalline wall, vanishing from sight.</p><p>Old Devil Fang was the second to escape, following the elder from the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>His eyes flickered.</p><p>He had thought that, having reached his level of cultivation, his heart would be as hard as iron, impervious to external influences. Yet, the High Priestess's final expression lingered in his mind.</p><p>He had previously dismissed her as someone merely using the revival of the Wu as an excuse to gain power and resources. He had looked down on her. Now, he realized he was wrong.</p><p>He had become a beneficiary of her belief.</p><p>With mixed emotions, Old Devil Fang vibrated his star wings and finally decided to head towards the Divine Furnace.</p><p>The High Priestess was dead.</p><p>Even if they managed to seal the Ancient Devil, only Human experts would be saved.</p><p>However, if the Ancient Devil broke free, and the demonic tribulation descended, the Wu would also face annihilation.</p><p>Old Devil Fang didn't seize the opportunity to steal the Divine Furnace but chose to repair the ancient rune restrictions instead.</p><p>By now, the elder from the Four Saints Palace had also reached the Ancient Dragon Corpse Hall, racing against time to repair the ancient restrictions of the demon race.</p><p>…</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment, face contorted in rage, shifted its gaze towards the Demon Lord.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In the next instant, it appeared before the Demon Lord, reaching out and grabbing with true demonic energy, which transformed into shackles, seizing Fairy Nangui and dragging her over.</p><p>Everyone present had become lambs to the slaughter, at the mercy of the Ancient Devil's soul fragment.</p><p>While the Ancient Devil's soul fragment was on its killing spree, Qin Sang was secretly transmitting a message to Spiritual Pearl.</p><p>"Senior, I have one more attack left, possessing the might of a supreme-grade magical treasure. However, I need your help to conceal it, lest the Ancient Devil notice…"</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang had condensed the Fire Seed.</p><p>The process had left him with a splitting headache, the pain he endured no less than that of Spiritual Pearl and the others. If not for the Jade Buddha, he would have been reduced to ashes.</p><p>The reason he had cultivated this secret technique at all costs, in such a dire situation, was due to a conjecture he had after seeing the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>If his conjecture proved true, he would be able to unleash an attack on the Nascent Soul level, potentially saving his life at a critical moment.</p><p>The Demon Banner Formation's key lay in the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Each of the eighteen demon banners sealed demonic fire, and the formation's power depended on how many banners and how much demonic fire he could control.</p><p>With Qin Sang's current cultivation, he could only control nine banners at most.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was unruly, and controlling it was extremely difficult.</p><p>However, if he could tame a wisp of demonic fire, condense a demonic seed, and merge it with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, imbuing his divine sense with its aura, could he gain the fire's recognition and weaken its resistance?</p><p>In the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, he had tested this. Unclaimed wisps of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire didn't exhibit strong hostility towards each other, nor did they fiercely retaliate.</p><p>It was precisely by cloaking himself in demonic fire that Qin Sang had successfully infiltrated the ghostly realm behind the demonic restriction and met Bai.</p><p>If this worked, he could control ten or even more banners, deploying a stronger Demon Banner Formation!</p><p>Qin Sang had never deployed more than nine banners before, and he wasn't certain how powerful it would be, but it was worth a try.</p><p>Being able to launch a single attack was enough!</p><p>Qin Sang focused on condensing the Fire Seed, finally succeeding. A tiny seed, shaped like a black lotus seed, appeared within his Purple Mansion.</p><p>The demonic fire aura was extremely faint, as if a gust of wind could extinguish it.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's limit.</p><p>He understood that his cultivation was insufficient, far from being able to control the demonic fire. Maintaining the Fire Seed's form was already fortunate. If he wanted to subdue spiritual fire like Old Devil Mou, he might not be able to achieve it even after reaching the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Even so, if Old Devil Mou witnessed the speed at which Qin Sang condensed the Fire Seed, he would be utterly astonished.</p><p>When Qin Sang completed the secret technique, he was horrified to discover the situation had deteriorated beyond redemption. After Spiritual Pearl and the others died, the Ancient Devil's soul fragment wouldn't hesitate to toss them into the blood coffin as well.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how effective his attack would be, but he refused to surrender to fate!</p><p>Seeing Spiritual Pearl not far from him, he immediately transmitted a message, quickly explaining the situation.</p><p>Spiritual Pearl, severely injured and dying, was utterly surprised upon receiving Qin Sang's message.</p><p>A small fry, accidentally dragged in and overlooked by both sides, not only hadn't been severely injured by the demonic howl but also claimed to have the power to counterattack. How could this not surprise him?</p><p>At this point, every bit of help was invaluable.</p><p>They were gravely wounded.</p><p>The Ancient Devil's soul fragment, in its haste, had also paid a price, its strength greatly reduced. It was a mutually detrimental situation.</p><p>Spiritual Pearl instantly made a decision, transmitting back, "You focus on setting up the formation. I'll help conceal it. Remember to follow my instructions."</p><p>He gathered his remaining strength, creating a barrier around Qin Sang, masking the formation's fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled and sat down cross-legged, summoning the demon banners.</p><p>He discovered the banners were indeed easier to control than before. When his divine sense tried to stimulate the Nine Nether Demonic Fire within the banners, the resistance he encountered was weaker.</p><p>Qin Sang brought out all eighteen demon banners at once.</p>
