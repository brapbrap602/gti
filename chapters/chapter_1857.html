Chapter 1848: Drawn In


A stone pavilion hung suspended in the void, positioned precisely at the intersection of three illusory landscapes, surrounded by ever-shifting mirages.  
Battered by golden light, the mirages transformed even more violently, becoming a kaleidoscope of the bizarre.
However, the fluctuations of the three illusory landscapes couldn't penetrate the pavilion's interior, as if shielded by an invisible barrier.
While the outside world was subjected to wind and rain, the pavilion remained tranquil, a rare sight within the entire Altar of Order.
At this moment, several demon cultivators, standing and sitting, sought refuge within the pavilion.
Some sensed the spiritual energy fluctuations of the Nascent Soul Grand Formation, while others fixated on the Vajra Bodhi Tree, licking their lips as greed flickered in their hearts.
However, as their gazes drifted towards a black-robed youth meditating at the pavilion's center, they quickly suppressed their avarice, not daring to act rashly.
"Your Highness, the grand formation is complete. The area has been locked down. There shouldn't be any mistakes..."
A long-bearded elder, standing respectfully beside the black-robed youth, bowed slightly and spoke deferentially.
The black-robed youth was a Demon King, known as Ling You Wang.
The Demon Marquises all turned their eyes to Ling You Wang, awaiting his command.
"Oh?"
Ling You Wang opened his eyes, revealing a pair of eerily black orbs devoid of white, as if capable of absorbing all light.
The sudden sight of Ling You Wang's eyes, despite the Demon Marquises' preparation, sent a tremor through their hearts, deepening their reverence.
Only the long-bearded elder remained unfazed, raising a finger to point towards the convergence point of the Nascent Soul Grand Formation's spiritual energy.
"Hehe, it's time to move..."
Ling You Wang's laughter was as strange as his black eyes, sending chills down the spines of the Demon Marquises.
Before his voice faded, Ling You Wang rose, casually glancing in the direction indicated by the long-bearded elder, then his figure flickered as he stepped out of the pavilion.
Beneath his feet, a black cloth appeared. Its surface was pitch black, marked only by a few intersecting thin golden lines that divided it into squares, resembling a fragment of a chessboard.
The black cloth rotated and expanded, and the chaotic mirages around it calmed.
With hands clasped behind his back, Ling You Wang strode through the void. With each step, the black cloth moved forward a considerable distance, quelling the mirages along the way, creating a clear path.
The Demon Marquises hastily followed, quickly realizing something was amiss.
Ling You Wang's direction was clearly towards the Vajra Bodhi Tree.
"Does Your Highness intend to retrieve the Vajra Fruit first?"
The long-bearded elder asked doubtfully.
Ling You Wang replied indifferently, "Heaven bestows, not to accept is to invite misfortune."
"But..."
The long-bearded elder hesitated. They were not close to the Vajra Bodhi Tree. Taking a detour to retrieve the treasure might delay the main objective.
Among these Demon Marquises, only he dared to question Ling You Wang's decision.
Ling You Wang didn't show anger, but let out an enigmatic chuckle. "With so many experts, one more or less won't make a difference. If I don't compete for merit, they might even be grateful."
The Demon Marquises were taken aback, exchanging glances, unsure how to react.
Earlier, when Ling You Wang ordered them to stay in the pavilion, they assumed it was a strategic move to conserve strength and await the opportune moment.
Unexpectedly, Ling You Wang had no intention of participating, choosing instead to take them fruit-picking at this crucial juncture.
Several Demon Kings had severed their cultivation to enter the Altar of Order, indicating the object of their contention must be of paramount importance, not to be missed.
If Ling You Wang didn't intend to participate in the struggle, why sever his cultivation? Wasn't he afraid of jeopardizing the mission and incurring the Great Sage's wrath, leaving him with no place in the Ghost Fang Kingdom?
The Demon Marquises were bewildered.  They looked towards the distance. Could there be some hidden aspect to the Nascent Soul Grand Formation, guaranteeing absolute success, that allowed Ling You Wang to be so confident?
"Hmm, if any of you are eager to earn merit, you may proceed on your own. Don't blame me later. I won't stop you," Ling You Wang suddenly turned, sweeping his gaze over them, speaking nonchalantly.
Meeting those black eyes, the Demon Marquises felt a chill down their spines, shaking their heads vehemently.
Merit was desirable, but not at the cost of their lives!
This battle was bound to be fierce, and they were already apprehensive, fearing they wouldn't escape the Altar of Order alive.
Ling You Wang's actions gave them a reason to stay away from the eye of the storm, exactly what they wanted.
Compared to their safety, the Vajra Fruit was secondary.
Even if something went wrong, Ling You Wang would bear the brunt of the consequences.
...
Green flames floated in the void.
Dozens of green flames, resembling ghostfire, drifted about with seeming lightness.
However, the green flames here were densely packed, forming a sea of fire. As they drifted, they constantly collided with each other, merging and splitting.
Each merging and splitting released a peculiar wave, appearing gentle to the naked eye, like a gentle breeze, causing the surrounding flames to sway gently, seemingly harmless.
Suddenly, a beam of white light shot out from the edge of the sea of fire.
'Boom!'
Runes flickered within the white light, revealing a talisman sword. Its sword energy, like a rainbow, cleaved the sea of fire.
A distinct fissure formed at the edge of the sea of fire, yet the imposing sword light of the talisman sword dimmed at an alarming rate, fading towards oblivion.
It was the seemingly harmless waves generated by the colliding green flames that were 'devouring' the talisman sword.
Clearly, everything here was merely a facade, concealing danger within the sea of fire.
As the sword light neared extinction, a cyan light emanated from the fissure in the sea of fire.
The cyan light was remarkably pure, possessing a strange power that brought tranquility to the observer's mind. But the cyan light itself was far from tranquil, surging rapidly towards the opening of the fissure.
Finally, at the moment the fissure closed, the cyan light burst out of the sea of fire, revealing several slightly dishevelled figures.
These figures, all dressed as Daoists, numbered six. Their Daoist robes bore scorch marks.  Emerging from the sea of fire, they expressed palpable relief.
The cyan light gradually converged.
They stopped at the edge of the sea of fire, looking back with lingering fear in their eyes.
Their experience within the sea of fire had left them shaken.  They hadn't expected to encounter such a perilous illusory landscape before even reaching the deepest part of the Altar of Order, nearly meeting their demise.
"Cough, cough..."
Among them, a white-haired old Daoist clutched his chest, coughing violently.
The cyan light finally retreated into a turquoise jade sphere held in his other hand. It was this treasure, jointly wielded by the group, that had protected them against the green flames.
"Master!"
"Senior Zuo!"
...
Seeing the white-haired old Daoist's ashen face and weak aura, the others were alarmed.
They all knew this Senior Zuo's true identity.
He was once a Grand True Man, holding the official rank of Third Grade, a Ninth Heaven Golden Palace High Minister, serving as the Deputy Envoy and Co-Judge of the Heavenly Hub Institute.
However, many years ago, Senior Zuo had resigned from his position, withdrawing from worldly affairs. Thus, most addressed him as Senior.
With Senior Zuo's long absence, many speculated that he might have failed his tribulation, or entered secluded cultivation. Others believed that, due to his exceptional talent, the Dao Court recognized his potential to become a True Monarch, granting him permission to cultivate in seclusion.  He might now be at the mid or even late stage of the Five Talismans Realm.
Therefore, they were all astonished when they learned that Senior Zuo had severed his cultivation.
"It's nothing!"
Senior Zuo put away the jade sphere and waved his hand dismissively.
The worry on the others' faces remained.
With Senior Zuo's strength, the dangers of the illusory landscape shouldn't have injured him so severely.
Unfortunately, they had first encountered demons unexpectedly and, caught off guard, been ambushed. To protect them, Senior Zuo had taken a blow from a Demon King, sustaining injuries.
Having just escaped the enemy and before they could regain their footing, the eruption of golden light destabilized the illusory landscape, causing the normally benign green flames to surge in power. Caught unprepared, they were engulfed by the flames.
Fortunately, Senior Zuo reacted swiftly, shielding them from the initial onslaught of the green flames, but worsening his own injuries.
"How are your injuries, Senior?"
A True Man asked with concern.
While their individual strengths were not weak, and with caution, they wouldn't fear the inherent dangers of the illusory landscape, Senior Zuo's injuries were a concern.  If they encountered a Demon King, the situation could become dire.
Even with their cultivation severed, the True Men didn't consider themselves a match for a Demon King.
Senior Zuo suppressed his erratic aura, looked towards where the spiritual energy of the Nascent Soul Grand Formation converged, then took out a jade talisman and sensed for a moment.  "I feel my Dao Foundation is damaged. I must suppress my injuries first, or I'll become a burden. However, this matter is of utmost importance.  One more person adds to our strength. You all go ahead, to that place, and rendezvous with Fellow Daoist Qi. You should still make it in time..."
Saying this, Senior Zuo pointed south and gave detailed instructions.
Understanding the gravity of the situation, the True Men immediately followed his orders. One remained behind.  "The Altar of Order is unstable, and Senior's injuries are serious. Let Fellow Daoist Liu protect you, Senior."
They had just learned that Senior Zuo cultivated the Golden Seal Altar and had no demon soldiers under his command.
Senior Zuo's face was pale, his injuries nearly uncontrollable. He nodded with closed eyes, moved away from the green flames, found a safe spot, and consumed a medicinal pill to heal.
True Man Liu stood guard beside Senior Zuo, his face filled with vigilance, but his gaze was drawn to the Vajra Bodhi Tree.
They could no longer see the Vajra Bodhi Tree when they escaped the danger, only a gradually dimming golden flame.
Preoccupied earlier, including the departed True Men, none had noticed the Vajra Fruit.
But the flame lay between them and their destination. They might pass by there after Senior Zuo recovered. Uncertain what this phenomenon signified, True Man Liu couldn't help but steal a few more glances.
...
While groups of cultivators and demon cultivators advanced towards their respective goals, Qin Sang was also on the move.
He exited the flower field space, wings sprouting from his back, transforming into a streak of lightning as he soared through the sky.
The Altar of Order was now in chaos, fraught with hidden dangers. Many illusory landscapes that Qin Sang had traversed numerous times, once familiar, were now unrecognizable, hindering his movement techniques.
However, with his knowledge of the Altar of Order and the aid of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, constantly changing direction, detouring, and avoiding obstacles, he managed to navigate the dangers, maintaining a good speed.
As he flew, Qin Sang kept his eyes fixed on the Vajra Bodhi Tree.
As time passed, the Vajra Bodhi Tree faded faster and faster. Qin Sang could only try to memorize every detail, deducing the tree's location and its distance from him.
"It doesn't seem too far..."
Qin Sang pondered.
The tree's shadow was vanishing too quickly. At this rate, he wouldn't reach it before it disappeared completely.
However, Qin Sang had imprinted the surrounding scenery in his mind.
His only hope now was that no one else would beat him to it.
'Whoosh!'
A cold gust of wind suddenly attacked from below.
Qin Sang's gaze remained fixed on the tree's shadow, but his reaction was instantaneous.  He flapped his phoenix wings powerfully.
Accompanied by a clap of thunder, his speed increased by fifty percent.
As Qin Sang distanced himself, the gust of wind arrived, revealing a strange silver tentacle.
The tentacle missed its target, writhing in frustration, its suckers constantly sucking, as if alive.
Qin Sang didn't look back. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had clearly seen the tentacle and discovered it wasn't alone. Below, a silver mist churned, revealing thousands of tentacles extending from within, their tips all pointing at Qin Sang.
Hearing the '嗖嗖' sound of something cutting through the air, Qin Sang's scalp tingled.  He fully exerted his movement technique, narrowly dodging the onslaught of countless tentacles.
As he escaped the tentacles' attack range, Qin Sang couldn't resist glancing back. He remembered this place. Previously, the silver mist had been calm. He hadn't expected it to conceal such grotesque creatures.
Compared to the tentacles behind him, the surroundings seemed relatively safe and peaceful.
Ahead lay a stretch of broken walls and ruins.
This place must have once been a magnificent palace. Now, nothing remained intact. Not a single wall taller than a person could be found, and the collapsed sections had vanished without a trace.
Though ruined, the walls still possessed a mystical quality.
Qin Sang had tried before and discovered the walls were exceptionally sturdy, not even a single brick could be dislodged. Now, the remnants shimmered with a jade-like luster, clearly extraordinary.
He deliberately slowed down, observing carefully, confirming that the ruins posed no threat.  Just as he was about to increase his speed, his gaze sharpened, and his figure vanished.
A short while later.
Spiritual light flickered on the right side of the ruins, as several figures flew in, their expressions wary as they surveyed the area.
These were Daoist True Men.
Time was of the essence, preventing a thorough investigation. The True Men, following their previous strategy, dispatched two to scout ahead while the others remained on guard.
The two scouts flew to the center of the ruins without incident.  The ruins seemed safe, so the others increased their speed.
The group whizzed past.
After they left, a figure materialized at the edge of the ruins. It was Qin Sang, who had anticipated their arrival and concealed himself.
"Another top-tier expert!"
Qin Sang watched the direction in which the Daoists departed.
To avoid complications, Qin Sang had only observed from a distance, yet he sensed a threat from one of the True Men.
This person's strength was likely on par with the old Daoist beside True Man Wan.
Besides the known Immortal Officials, there were so many hidden experts. The Dao Court's depth was unfathomable.
If the group hadn't been in such a hurry, they might have detected him when he discovered them.
"The Altar of Order is teeming with experts! However, their target isn't the Vajra Fruit..."
Qin Sang's expression eased.
As he expected, they were heading towards the convergence point of the grand formation's spiritual energy. That was the battlefield for the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom.  The Vajra Bodhi Tree was merely incidental.
Judging by their urgency, the object of their contention must be extremely important.
This meant his competition shouldn't be too strong.
Relieved, a smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.  He transformed into a bolt of lightning, streaking across the ruins.
The golden light was receding.
Qin Sang traversed familiar yet alien illusory landscapes, his eyes fixated on the direction of the ancient tree.
However, the tree's shadow was no longer visible, only a hazy golden flame, slowly fading.
Finally, even the golden flame extinguished, with no sign of anyone having taken the fruit.
"I should be close, just within this illusory landscape ahead.  I wonder if anyone else is searching..."
Qin Sang folded his phoenix wings, his aura and form disappearing as he merged into the shadows.
