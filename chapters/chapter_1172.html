<h1>Chapter 1164: Arrangements</h1><p>Having endured countless trials and tribulations, even the dignified sect leader could not hold back his tears, which streamed down his face like rain. Qin Sang sighed deeply.</p><p>"Your disciple has embarrassed herself, making the Sect Master laugh," Mei Gu said, wiping away her tears. Her girlish demeanor vanished in an instant, and her expression quickly returned to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and said, "I remember that before I left, you and the others had only just established your foundations. I merely set the framework, but for you to lead the Demon Flame Sect to this level truly exceeds my expectations."</p><p>"This is not solely the merit of your disciple. Lu Shidi, before his betrayal, also gave his full support. Zhao Shidi has poured no less effort into the sect than I have. We worked together, and by fortunate chance, encountered several opportunities that led us to where we are today..."</p><p>Mei Gu was humble, not claiming sole credit, and she particularly emphasized Zhao Shanran's contributions. As she recounted a few of these events, she noticed Qin Sang's keen interest and, seeing that he did not stop her, briefly summarized the experiences of the past century.</p><p>Qin Sang saw through Mei Gu's intentions and said straightforwardly, "Those who have contributed naturally deserve rewards. Although Zhao Shanran is advanced in years, I see that his cultivation has been refined well. It is not impossible for him to form a Golden Core."</p><p>Hearing this, Mei Gu was overjoyed. "Your disciple thanks the Sect Master on behalf of Zhao Shidi."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand to stop Mei Gu from bowing and changed his tone, asking, "Let's not talk about others for now. What are your own plans for the future? The fact that you were able to form a Golden Core under such circumstances shows not only your strategic talent but also that your cultivation aptitude and opportunities are of the highest caliber."</p><p>"Your disciple dares to ask the Sect Master, in light of my dedication to the sect, to guide me in my cultivation and help me advance further on the path of immortality! Your disciple is willing to give up everything and begs the Sect Master to grant this wish!"</p><p>Mei Gu seemed to have already prepared her request, speaking decisively and without hesitation as she knelt on the ground. Previously, she had not dared to hope for much progress on the path of immortality, intending to devote all her efforts to the development of the sect. Qin Sang's appearance had given her a glimmer of hope. The sect now had its strongest pillar of support. More importantly, the Sect Master was actually a Nascent Soul Ancestor. Mei Gu knew that this would be the greatest opportunity of her life, and she had to seize it no matter what.</p><p>"Very well, I accept you as my disciple," Qin Sang agreed without any pretense. He had a favorable impression of Mei Gu, and with the Demon Flame Sect merging into the Azure Goat Temple, Mei Gu and the others would be the backbone.</p><p>Mei Gu was surprised by how smoothly things went, thinking she might have misheard, but after a moment of stunned silence, she quickly reacted.</p><p>"Your disciple pays respects to Master!" Mei Gu suppressed her overwhelming joy and performed the disciple ceremony with utmost seriousness.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for Mei Gu to rise and said solemnly, "From now on, you are my second disciple. You have some fellow disciples elsewhere, but for now, you cannot meet them."</p><p>Mei Gu was puzzled.</p><p>Qin Sang paused and then said, "In the past, I provoked a powerful enemy and was forced to flee. The enemy is formidable, and it is not suitable for me to reveal myself publicly now. I will temporarily assume another identity, and you must continue to lead the Demon Flame Sect. My cultivation level is something you should keep to yourself and not disclose to others."</p><p>Mei Gu was startled. No wonder the Sect Master had been missing for so long. What shocked her even more was that the enemy was so terrifying that even the Sect Master, a Nascent Soul Ancestor, had to be this cautious.</p><p>"Your disciple understands!" Mei Gu did not ask further. The enmity between Nascent Soul Ancestors was not something she could involve herself in.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and handed Mei Gu a jade slip. "After you lead the disciples to the front lines, give this to the Sect Master of the Illusory Mist Sect. He and I have some friendship. Although the Illusory Mist Sect is of the righteous path, they can still offer you some protection."</p><p>Mei Gu took the jade slip and carefully stored it, feeling reassured. In the Cold Domain, the righteous and demonic paths, despite their differences, always united against external threats. This time, facing the Sin Abyss, both sides would work together, and the Illusory Mist Sect Master could look out for them. With a Nascent Soul Ancestor speaking on their behalf, their safety was greatly assured.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang gifted Mei Gu a mid-grade magical treasure as a reward and personally gave her some guidance. Afterward, he suppressed his cultivation back to the Golden Core level and instructed Mei Gu to bring in Zhao Shanran and the others.</p><p>"Greetings, Sect Master..." Zhao Shanran and the others bowed in respect.</p><p>Qin Sang singled out Zhao Shanran and said gravely, "Mei Gu mentioned that you have dedicated yourself to the sect over the years, and even if there is no great merit, there is certainly hard work. These two pills have the effect of aiding in forming a Nascent Soul and are your reward. Refine the pills and cultivate diligently. There is still a chance for you to form a Golden Core."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang flicked his fingers, and a jade bottle containing two Demon-Slaying Pills flew toward Zhao Shanran. Since his return, Qin Sang had not sold a single Demon-Slaying Pill, keeping them all for himself.</p><p>Zhao Shanran hurriedly caught the jade bottle, his face filled with excitement, and knelt down to kowtow. "Your disciple, Zhao Shanran, thanks the Sect Master. Your disciple will spare no effort to repay the Sect Master's great kindness."</p><p>"Rise. Just keep it in mind. In the future, do not betray the sect, or else Lu Xing will be your example!" Qin Sang's tone turned cold.</p><p>The disciples shivered and quickly assured him they would not dare.</p><p>"As for the rest of you, you can also exchange merits for rewards," Qin Sang said, looking at the other disciples. "With the great battle approaching, as a temporary measure, those at the False Core stage can first receive one pill. However, I must warn you, it is best to attempt forming a Golden Core on your own first. If you cannot succeed, then take the pill. This pill can increase the chances of forming a Golden Core, but the cost is being plagued by demonic energy, which not only affects your strength but also greatly increases the difficulty of breaking through bottlenecks in future cultivation."</p><p>The disciples' expressions varied upon hearing this. Zhao Shanran, however, was indifferent. All he cared about now was forming a Golden Core, regardless of the cost.</p><p>"This demonic energy is not without a cure. Taking certain specific spiritual medicines can eliminate it. I will not intervene. Whether you can find these medicines will depend on your own abilities."</p><p>Qin Sang handed Mei Gu another jade slip containing records of various spiritual medicines. These medicines were nearly exhausted in the Canglang Sea, but they were still relatively easy to find in the Cold Domain, though their prices would not be low. This would serve as a trial for them.</p><p>...</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang stayed at the Demon Flame Sect, leaving them with some resources and working with Mei Gu to formulate plans for the sect's development, preparing for its eventual merger into the Azure Goat Temple and transition to the righteous path.</p><p>Knowing the inside story, Mei Gu had no objections. On the contrary, she was delighted at the opportunity to leave the demonic path.</p><p>Soon, the day of departure arrived. As previously arranged, Zhao Shanran stayed behind, while Mei Gu led the other disciples to the front lines.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang called Mei Gu over and taught her several life-saving techniques.</p><p>"This time, you have another mission," Qin Sang finally revealed his true purpose. "Approach the Azure Sun Demon Sect discreetly. It would be best if you could befriend the old demon's personal disciples and gather information on his temperament and the Ancestral Sacred Flame..."</p><p>A flicker of surprise passed through Mei Gu's eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang reassured her, "Do not overthink it. My enemy is not the old demon. The Ancestral Sacred Flame is of some use to me, and if possible, I hope to make a deal with the old demon. I am unable to act personally, so you will investigate on my behalf."</p><p>Mei Gu's heart eased. "Your disciple obeys!"</p><p>**</p>
