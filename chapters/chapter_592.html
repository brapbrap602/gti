<h1>Chapter 585:  Three Lights Jade Liquid</h1><p>Qin Sang's eyes were strange.</p><p>He didn't know where Yi Tiannie got his outdated information from, judging that Qin Sang needed the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit to form his Golden Core, not knowing that the fruit was no longer necessary.  After entering the Purple Micro Palace, with a Nascent Soul cultivator nearby, Yi Tiannie likely feared being discovered and didn't dare to eavesdrop openly, remaining unaware of recent events.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't remind him.</p><p>Yi Tiannie, lurking nearby, had discovered too many secrets. Qin Sang had already secretly resolved to eliminate him, even if it meant forgoing the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!</p><p>"Yi Lao Mo, you don't know, the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid only recently completed its eighth transformation. It will take at least another five hundred years to mature.  Even I can't wait for it to mature to refine the Fate-Resisting Pill. Your lifespan is nearing its end. You've turned to the Ghost Dao, relying on evil arts to prolong your life. How long can you linger? Whether you want to become a Ghost King or a Heavenly Corpse King, you certainly won't live to see that day. What's the point?"</p><p>Yi Tiannie remained unmoved, coldly sneering.</p><p>"Old man's business is none of your concern!"</p><p>"Since the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid will take another five hundred years to mature, even if you form your Golden Core, you'll only have four hundred years left. Be smart and use it to exchange for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit."</p><p>"Otherwise, if you fail to form your Golden Core, everything is meaningless!"</p><p>"Hand over the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid. Not only will I return the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit to you, I will also swear on my inner demons to keep all your secrets. You killed Jiu Pao, seized his Qianjun Ring, and annihilated my Kuiyin Sect. I can let bygones be bygones."</p><p>"You should know that ghost cultivators fear inner demons the most. I seek the Dao, and there's no need to risk my life to harm you."</p><p>"Otherwise, once I spread the word, how could Mount Shaohua tolerate you?!"</p><p>Yi Tiannie's surprise attack on Qin Sang failed. He tried to threaten him, to negotiate a trade.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he became somewhat suspicious.  From Yi Tiannie's tone, it seemed he already knew the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid wasn't mature enough.</p><p>But he still risked the entire sect to seize the herb. Could there be a way to refine the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid into a pill?</p><p>Could there be some hidden circumstances?</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering this, Yun Youzi beside him suddenly exclaimed, "Three Lights Jade Liquid!  There's Three Lights Jade Liquid in the Purple Micro Palace?"</p><p>Yun Youzi was hiding behind a rock wall behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Earlier, to repel the Shadow-Devouring Leopard, he had secretly used his essence blood to activate the Immaculate Pearl, triggering the Blood Restriction of the Demon King.  It was easy to see he was extremely weak.</p><p>During the Sky-Flying Rakshasa's mutation, Yun Youzi had cleverly hidden within the Demon King's Blood Restriction. He could only mobilize a tiny fraction of the Blood Restriction's power to protect himself, lacking the strength to aid Qin Sang.</p><p>If Yi Tiannie attacked him, Yun Youzi would certainly be doomed.</p><p>However, Yi Tiannie couldn't guarantee he could break through the Demon King's Blood Restriction and kill Yun Youzi in one strike.  If Yun Youzi delayed him even a moment, Qin Sang would catch up.</p><p>In Yi Tiannie's view, Qin Sang was his type.</p><p>Trying to threaten someone like Qin Sang with his friends and family was like a fool's dream; the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit was certainly more important.  Therefore, he completely ignored Yun Youzi and went straight for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.</p><p>Yun Youzi remained silent until the confrontation, then suddenly spoke.</p><p>"Old thing, who are you! How do you know about the Three Lights Jade Liquid?"</p><p>Qin Sang was still wondering what "Three Lights Jade Liquid" was, but when Yun Youzi spoke, Yi Tiannie's expression changed, his eyes fixed on Yun Youzi, murderous intent overwhelming.</p><p>Ignoring Yi Tiannie's threat, Yun Youzi quickly explained to Qin Sang, his voice filled with barely contained excitement.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had seen Yun Youzi so agitated.</p><p>"Brother Qin, you must know of the Three Lights Divine Water, right?"</p><p>In many myths and legends, the Three Lights Divine Water existed, its fame known far and wide. How could he not know?</p><p>Legend says the Three Lights Divine Water was collected by immortals from the sun, moon, and stars, three primordial divine lights, transforming into divine water with boundless uses.  It could dispel all poisons and cure all illnesses, considered the world's best healing medicine.</p><p>Reviving the dead and mending broken bones wasn't an exaggeration!</p><p>But legend is just legend.  The texts mentioning the Three Lights Divine Water are all human fantasies, filled with mystery and magical colors.</p><p>Unlike ancient texts containing cultivation methods, incantations, or verifiable facts.</p><p>These should be considered fiction, not facts!</p><p>When Qin Sang read about this on Baota Peak, it was just to broaden his horizons, viewing it as interesting stories, appreciating the romance and imagination of the ancients, who had never seen immortals but already imagined their treasures.</p><p>Yunyouzi suddenly mentioned the Three Lights Divine Water. Could such a thing really exist?</p><p>“Whether the Three Lights Divine Water is a figment of imagination or truly exists in the world, no one knows.</p><p>“As far as I know, in the Ziwei Palace, there was a treasure called the Gathering Spirit Bowl, which could simulate the Three Lights Divine Water. It collected the essence of heaven and earth, merging the power of the sun, moon, and stars to refine a divine water, named the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>“While the Three Lights Jade Liquid doesn't possess the miraculous effects of the Three Lights Divine Water—reviving the dead and healing wounds—it contains the essence of heaven and earth. Consuming it rapidly nourishes the body and restores true essence, an effect no less than that of ten-thousand-year-old spiritual milk.</p><p>“It’s also a miraculous healing medicine. After poisoning or serious injury, taking it allows for swift recovery.</p><p>“However, Ziwei Palace valued another amazing effect of the Three Lights Jade Liquid most: its ability to transform heavenly treasures, making their medicinal properties even more potent!</p><p>“This effect, however, requires both the Gathering Spirit Bowl and a certain celestial restriction.</p><p>“This celestial restriction exists only in the heart of the ancient medicinal garden, a fairyland called Xuanpu Palace.  Within, all the plants are rare heavenly treasures. Even the lowest-grade spiritual herbs surpass Nine Illusion Sky Orchids.</p><p>“These herbs grow in Xuanpu Palace, receiving the celestial restriction’s daily purification. After accumulating for a certain period, they are irrigated with the Three Lights Jade Liquid to aid their premature transformation and maturation.</p><p>“Once, during a Ziwei Palace opening, an ancient ruin in the inner hall was discovered—fragments of Xuanpu Palace.  It was said that nearly ten heavenly treasures grew there, causing a great battle where Yuan Ying cultivators and powerful demons completely plundered the location.</p><p>“If Qin Sang's Nine Illusion Sky Orchid came from Xuanpu Palace, it must have been taken then, already receiving sufficient purification.</p><p>“It needn't wait five hundred years. Irrigating it with the Three Lights Jade Liquid will directly transform it into a Sky Illusion Orchid, with medicinal effects far exceeding the Nine Illusion Sky Orchid!</p><p>“A Du E Pill refined from a Sky Illusion Orchid would increase the chance of forming a Nascent Soul by 30%, instead of the usual 20%!</p><p>“However, the Gathering Spirit Bowl has long since disappeared, whether stolen or destroyed during a catastrophe in the Ziwei Palace, so no one has ever obtained the Three Lights Jade Liquid from the palace.</p><p>“I thought the Three Lights Jade Liquid no longer existed. Could it be that some remains were found in Ziwei Palace… by you?”</p><p>This last sentence was Yunyouzi’s question to Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Though the explanation was lengthy, Yunyouzi and Qin Sang quickly clarified the matter through their divine sense communication.</p>
