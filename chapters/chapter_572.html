<h1>Chapter 565: Abyss of Sin</h1><p>A sudden surge of energy was palpable. Although darkness shrouded the path ahead, everyone sensed something amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, venturing into the Violet Palace for the first time, were bewildered. They assumed it was a characteristic of the immortal formation, and though apprehensive, remained relatively calm.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators, however, paled.</p><p>Red Hair Ancestor erupted in fury, his tiger-like eyes glaring at Daoist Zhenyi.</p><p>“Old Daoist, what devilry are you up to?!”</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi, utterly perplexed, frowned. “Red Hair, have you lost your mind?”</p><p>Red Hair Ancestor roared, “If you’re so eager to die, I’ll gladly oblige once we're out. But if you dare to play tricks within the immortal formation, I'll destroy the Northern Star Formation this instant! Without it, let's see how many of you can escape!”</p><p>Unjustly berated, Daoist Zhenyi seethed with anger, unsure what had possessed Red Hair Ancestor.  Instead of uniting against the anomaly, he was instigating infighting.</p><p>As suspicion brewed between the two groups, the energy surge ahead grew restless, lunging towards them with alarming speed.</p><p>Still within the immortal formation, surrounded by the terrifying Void Winds, even Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't guarantee their safety without the protection of the Minor Northern Star Formation.</p><p>Despite their mistrust, the two sides stopped short of open conflict.</p><p>They attempted to retreat using the Minor Northern Star Formation, hoping to evade the oncoming force.  However, the surge accelerated at an incredible pace, reaching them in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Finally, they could discern figures emerging from the darkness, their faces obscured.</p><p>“Who goes there?!”</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi, forgetting his quarrel with Red Hair Ancestor, stared ahead in alarm. Encountering humanoid figures within the immortal formation was a grim omen.</p><p>Red Hair Ancestor eyed Daoist Zhenyi suspiciously. Could it be that the Heavenly Mandate Alliance wasn't behind this after all?</p><p>Moments ago, Daoist Chongyi had discreetly informed him of a clandestine meeting between the Sect Master of the Wuji Sect and Daoist Huang Yun of the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.  He hadn't paid it much heed.</p><p>The Minor Cold Realm was a fragmented land, with no overarching authority governing the various sects. It was perfectly normal for the Wuji Sect Master to have connections with the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.</p><p>The Wuji Sect's base was in the Minor Cold Realm, with countless disciples. Relocating wouldn't be easy. Red Hair Ancestor believed that as long as the Sect Master wasn't a fool, he'd know which side to choose when facing such a significant situation.</p><p>Could even the strongest bond outweigh personal gain?</p><p>Even if Daoist Chongyi claimed they were acting suspiciously, it was a matter to investigate and prepare for after leaving the Violet Palace.</p><p>If there was truly something amiss, he didn't believe the Wuji Sect Master could conceal it indefinitely.</p><p>Red Hair Ancestor reasoned that even if the Wuji Sect Master had been swayed by the Heavenly Mandate Alliance, he wouldn't act within the immortal formation. Yet, events often defied expectations, and so, at the first sign of anomaly, his suspicion immediately fell upon the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.</p><p>Countless cultivators from both realms had entered the Violet Palace throughout history, both in his two expeditions and those led by predecessors. Never had they encountered such an irregularity within the immortal formation.</p><p>Why would this happen now, if not for foul play?</p><p>As Red Hair Ancestor wrestled with his doubts…</p><p>A sinister cackle echoed from the darkness. “Haha… Old Daoist, Red Hair, surprised to find the immortal formations of the Sin Palace and the Violet Palace connected, aren't you?”</p><p>“Demon Lord Ye!”</p><p>“Abyss of Sin!”</p><p>Both Red Hair Ancestor and Daoist Zhenyi paled.</p><p>Since ancient times, the Violet Palace in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and the Sin Palace at the heart of the Abyss of Sin had always emerged simultaneously, without exception.</p><p>During these periods, regardless of the intensity of ongoing conflicts, all realms would invariably declare a truce.</p><p>Every cultivator knew that these two divine palaces were deeply intertwined, or else such perfect synchronization would be impossible.</p><p>However, despite countless years of effort, no one had ever ascertained the exact nature of their connection.</p><p>In times of relative peace, or under the leadership of a late Nascent Soul cultivator, numerous cross-explorations had been conducted.</p><p>All in vain.</p><p>Firstly, even late Nascent Soul cultivators lacked the power to penetrate the deepest secrets of the two palaces.</p><p>Secondly, the Violet Palace and the Sin Palace, whether in terms of their restrictions, the treasures within, or their architectural styles, bore no resemblance to each other, being polar opposites.</p><p>The Violet Palace, with its towering celestial gates and swirling immortal clouds, resembled a divine palace descended from the heavens.</p><p>The Sin Palace, on the other hand, was an undeniable demonic stronghold.</p><p>Now, the Abyss of Sin had discovered a link between the outer formations of the two palaces, breached the passage between them, and appeared before them!</p><p>Red Hair Ancestor and Daoist Zhenyi couldn't fathom how Demon Lord Ye had discovered this connection, but they knew they were in dire straits.</p><p>Demon Lord Ye's purpose in bringing his forces here was all too clear.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Red Hair Ancestor suddenly realized something, shouting to Daoist Zhenyi, “Beware of Huang Tian!”</p><p>Before Daoist Zhenyi could react, two dazzling beams of blood-red light erupted from the center of the Minor Cold Realm and Heavenly Mandate Alliance formations.</p><p>These beams emanated from the yellow-robed Daoist of the Heavenly Mandate Alliance, the Nascent Soul cultivator known as Huang Tian, and from the Wuji Sect Master!</p><p>Their positions were strategically chosen.</p><p>Everyone stood around the star chart, divided into two factions.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi and Red Hair Ancestor led the way.</p><p>Huang Tian assisted in controlling the Minor Northern Star Formation, surrounded and protected by the Heavenly Mandate Alliance cultivators.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master stood beside Leng Yuntian, amidst the Minor Cold Realm cultivators!</p><p>The instant the blood-red light appeared, it was Qin Sang, not the Nascent Soul cultivators, who recognized it.</p><p>He was all too familiar with this light, having used it countless times himself.</p><p>Blood Defilement Divine Light!</p><p>However, these two beams were far more potent, intensely concentrated, their crimson glow reaching the sky, captivating and terrifying, far exceeding the power of the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Ebony Sword contained only a fragment of the Netherworld Bloodwood, while these two individuals possessed what seemed like at least half a tree's worth.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally understood what Huang Tian and the Wuji Sect Master were searching for in the Boundless Valley.</p><p>They were looking for the Netherworld Bloodwood!</p><p>Back then, their battle with the Thunder Swallowing Falcon was over the very piece of Netherworld Bloodwood he had stolen.</p><p>A legend circulated widely that Netherworld Bloodwood had once appeared in the Boundless Valley, shattered during a struggle between Nascent Soul demon cultivators, its fragments scattered throughout the valley's depths.</p><p>But for years, there had been no concrete evidence, no confirmation of anyone actually finding any.</p><p>Had Qin Sang not obtained a fragment himself, he too would have dismissed it as a fabrication.</p><p>These two must have possessed some means of protection, enabling them to venture into the valley and search for the Netherworld Bloodwood, and they had indeed managed to gather a substantial amount.</p>
