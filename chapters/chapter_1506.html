<h1>Chapter 1497: The Divine Bird's Shield</h1><p>The oppressive aura emanating from the Suspended Sword Pavilion was in no way inferior to the Four-Yoked Coiled Serpent Seal when it was unaffected by Liuli a moment ago!</p><p>Such an imposing pressure could only be achieved by a Numinous Treasure.</p><p>The Profound Sky Palace actually possessed two Numinous Treasures!</p><p>Qin Sang inhaled sharply, then his expression shifted slightly, as if he had sensed something.</p><p>"No, it seems slightly different from the Four-Yoked Coiled Serpent Seal..."</p><p>Qin Sang had this feeling, but he couldn't precisely articulate the difference between the Suspended Sword Pavilion and the Four-Yoked Coiled Serpent Seal.</p><p>After all, he had seen far too few Numinous Treasures.</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion didn't seem to be a true Numinous Treasure.</p><p>It was clearly Yin Changsheng's Intrinsic Dharma Treasure, not a legacy Numinous Treasure of the Profound Sky Palace, so it could only have been refined by Yin Changsheng himself.</p><p>To refine an Intrinsic Numinous Treasure at the Nascent Soul stage was simply too astonishing!</p><p>Regardless of whether the Suspended Sword Pavilion was a Numinous Treasure or a Dharma Treasure, the oppressive aura it emitted was undoubtedly real, and its power was probably no weaker than the Four-Yoked Coiled Serpent Seal at the beginning!</p><p>The danger he faced would not be diminished in the slightest.</p><p>This time, there was no Liuli to help contain it.</p><p>"You've forced me to bring out my Suspended Sword Pavilion. You can be proud of yourself."</p><p>Yin Changsheng spoke more.</p><p>His expression became even more distorted.</p><p>Many years ago, Yin Changsheng had set his sights on the Old Demon Hunmo, planning to lure him into the Holy Land and capture him alive. Many of his arrangements were made to counter the Old Demon Hunmo's demonic techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang had emerged ten years ago, and Liuli's divine ability had only been revealed half a year ago. Yin Changsheng changed his target at the last minute, but he didn't have time to make more thorough preparations.</p><p>However, Yin Changsheng believed that with the Four-Yoked Coiled Serpent Seal, the Falling Serenity Divine Restriction, and numerous divine abilities, capturing a mid-Nascent Soul stage cultivator should be a piece of cake.</p><p>He never expected that Tong Lingyu's schemes were also very deep, and that she had painstakingly found various ways to counter him.</p><p>Qin Sang's strength far exceeded those of his peers, comparable to a Grand Master.</p><p>If he hadn't been unable to take down Qin Sang in a short time and been forced into this situation, Yin Changsheng wouldn't have used the Suspended Sword Pavilion.</p><p>As his Intrinsic Dharma Treasure, the Suspended Sword Pavilion could help him stabilize his mind. Now that he was forced to use this treasure to fight, the effect was immediate, and Yin Changsheng's mental state became increasingly unstable, even showing on the surface.</p><p>*Ding-ling-ling...*</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion floated before Yin Changsheng.</p><p>The nine inverted miniature swords moved without wind, gently swaying within the Suspended Sword Pavilion, emitting a series of sounds, not sword cries, but crisp bell tones.</p><p>The sound was pleasing to the ear.</p><p>But to Qin Sang, it sounded like a demonic tune urging him to his death!</p><p>The madness in Yin Changsheng's eyes accumulated. He stared fixedly at Qin Sang, his killing intent soaring to the sky, and the cold mist around the ice coffin showed intense fluctuations.</p><p>*Ding-ling-ling! Ding-ling-ling!*</p><p>The suspended swords swayed violently.</p><p>Each sword was not large, and crystal clear.</p><p>The ancient characters on the blades of the precious swords shimmered with light, multicolored and radiant.</p><p>An astonishing scene appeared. Each level manifested countless illusory sword energies.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>These sword energies transformed into streams of light, rapidly rotating around the Suspended Sword Pavilion, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>At this moment, the nine-story ice pavilion seemed to be surrounded by countless sword energies, becoming a veritable sword pavilion, but without the corresponding sword intent.</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion only had a name and shape related to swords. In reality, it was not a supreme treasure of the Sword Dao, but rather a sword shape formed using a special refinement technique.</p><p>It was an ultimate offensive Dharma Treasure, and each illusory sword energy was a condensed killing intent!</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng roared.</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion buzzed continuously, and the ancient characters on the nine mystic swords became increasingly dazzling. The illusory sword energies were engulfed by the light, transforming into a multicolored cloud.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion suddenly flashed in mid-air, and the multicolored radiance swept out, swift as lightning!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang felt a faint, stabbing pain in his Baihui acupoint, his scalp tingling. He had no doubt that if he was struck by the radiance, he would be severely injured if not killed, and would no longer be able to escape Yin Changsheng's grasp.</p><p>...</p><p>Liuli could sense the imminent danger, and her expression revealed despair. She had done everything she could, but she still couldn't change the outcome.</p><p>She could influence Yin Changsheng, but she couldn't take possession of the Four-Yoked Coiled Serpent Seal in front of Yin Changsheng.</p><p>She was too weak!</p><p>At this moment, Liuli felt a deep sense of helplessness.</p><p>In the end, she was going to die with him!</p><p>Liuli's eyelids trembled slightly. She opened her eyes and saw Qin Sang's profile.</p><p>The scene from that year, which Liuli had been deliberately trying to forget, resurfaced at this moment. Who could have imagined that a single night of ill-fated encounter would create so many ties between them.</p><p>Looking back on her life.</p><p>The first half of her life was spent cultivating tirelessly to save her master, and the second half was spent painstakingly trying to escape the evil technique. Her mind was always tense, never relaxed.</p><p>Liuli looked upward, her gaze seemingly piercing through the void, seeing her master whose life or death was unknown, feeling a sense of release and regret.</p><p>"Master, your disciple is truly tired."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of Liuli's many thoughts. He keenly noticed the change in Yin Changsheng's state, his thoughts racing. He flicked his finger, and a crimson flame flew out of the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>This flame was even more dazzling than the multicolored radiance.</p><p>Inside the flame, a treasure tree slowly rotated. The tree was wreathed in flames, endlessly burning, and there were nine divine birds, heads held high and tails upturned, lifelike.</p><p>Qin Sang had unexpectedly directly unleashed the Sun Divine Tree!</p><p>The moment the flame appeared, Yin Changsheng's eyes bulged, revealing an expression of disbelief.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with severity, he roared, and the true essence within his body surged like a tidal wave.</p><p>The flames on the divine tree surged. The three divine birds at the top came to life, their expressions suddenly becoming more agile. They spread their wings and took flight, detaching from the divine tree, rushing towards the radiance like arrows, unafraid.</p><p>Mid-flight, these three divine birds actually merged into one, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>This was the result of Qin Sang's continuous refinement over the years, trying to compress the three divine birds as much as possible. Although it couldn't directly increase the power of the explosion, it could make the energy of the Nanming Li Fire more concentrated.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>In an instant, the radiance and the divine bird collided.</p><p>At first, there was no earth-shattering sound, but an eerie silence.</p><p>The speed of the multicolored radiance suddenly slowed down, and the constantly flowing 'sword energies' also suddenly became stagnant, while the Sun Divine Bird disappeared into thin air, plunging into the interior of the radiance.</p><p>But the three people present could all feel that there was an extremely terrifying energy brewing there, about to explode.</p><p>The explosion came extremely quickly.</p><p>The multicolored radiance suddenly bulged, like a rapidly expanding ball of light, with crimson cracks appearing on its surface. From within the cracks, flames surged wildly.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A light brighter than the sun blazed in mid-air.</p><p>An unprecedented explosion occurred in the underground cavern.</p><p>Two attacks with power far exceeding that of Dharma Treasures released streams of energy turbulence, forming an energy storm in mid-air. The thick layer of ice covering the ground was instantly swept away, and nothing else could be seen within sight.</p><p>Qin Sang embraced Liuli, his figure flashing rapidly, dodging the aftermath of the explosion.</p><p>The Sun Divine Bird was used as a shield by Qin Sang, directly confronting the radiance of the Suspended Sword Pavilion, so there was naturally no worry of missing.</p>
