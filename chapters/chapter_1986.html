<h1>Chapter 1977: The Endgame</h1><p>On the border of Xuan Kingdom, a million-strong army stood poised for battle.  The opposing forces stretched for miles, their camps a sprawling forest of tents, their soldiers numerous as ants.  The ground before them, stained crimson from countless battles, bore silent testament to the carnage; the sheer number of fallen soldiers was horrifying.</p><p>As the sun rose, the battlefield erupted in a thunderous cacophony of war cries.  In the Yan Kingdom camp, a hilltop provided a commanding view of the entire conflict.  Yu Lang and his generals stood on the hill, silhouetted against the blood-red dawn.  Their expressions were grave as they watched the central clash.</p><p>Years of warfare had etched lines of hardened resolve onto Yu Lang's face, replacing some of his former scholarly grace.  He gazed anxiously at the fighting men, his eyes drifting southwards.  Not far away stood a towering peak, even higher than their vantage point, offering an unparalleled view of the battlefield.  It was a strategic high ground, but access was strictly forbidden to ordinary mortals.</p><p>Everyone knew the mountain was sacred, home to a newly constructed palace where a celestial master resided.  Occasionally, figures resembling the master, shrouded in mist, could be seen meditating on the mountain's ledges and cliffs, exuding an air of ethereal majesty.  The sight inspired reverence in every soldier.  The enemy also had a similar location.</p><p>Yu Lang’s concern wasn’t about the relative strength of the cultivators on either side; in fact, his side had won most of the previous engagements.  His worry stemmed from the ever-increasing casualties and the seemingly endless conflict. The central battlefield felt like a demonic pit, devouring countless lives, a chasm no amount of blood could fill.</p><p>Having witnessed death countless times, Yu Lang had become desensitized, yet he still felt a profound sense of unease.  He believed that many of these deaths were meaningless. The involvement of cultivators had not accelerated the end of the war; instead, it had amplified the bloodshed. Without the cultivators, he was confident he could launch a decisive strike, crushing the enemy army in a single blow, rather than this protracted stalemate.</p><p>He hadn’t expected to remain commander for so long.  He had assumed that once cultivators were involved, the conflict would inevitably become a battle between cultivators. Casualties among cultivators would lead to revenge, escalating from individual grudges to inter-sect conflicts, eventually leading to a large-scale struggle between opposing factions, drawing in more and more people and powers. That’s how most conflicts escalated.  Once Yuan Ying masters entered the fray, who would care about mere mortals?  The outcome would be decided by the most powerful cultivators, leaving the world in the hands of the victor.</p><p>But the reality was different.  Both sides exercised remarkable restraint.  Apart from the Yuan Ying masters who sat in the central command, deterring the enemy, no other Gold Core or higher-level cultivators had appeared on the battlefield. Even when cultivators died, the retaliatory forces sent by their sects never exceeded the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>This fragile peace continued until the final battle.  Then, powerful cultivators emerged like mushrooms after a spring rain.  Yu Lang was unsure how many Gold Core and Yuan Ying cultivators were hidden on the mountains.  They weren’t just observing; they also supplied 'treasures'.</p><p>A faint crimson mist now filled the battlefield, accompanied by the clang of gongs.  Both sides deployed three thousand soldiers. The crimson mist emanated from the Blood Yuan Banners of Yan's soldiers. The gong sounds came from the enemy, who had formed a semicircular formation. Behind them stood a Foundation Establishment cultivator wielding a large golden gong, supported by five hundred soldiers each beating a smaller gong.</p><p>The din of gongs was deafening.  These soldiers focused solely on drumming, leaving their side significantly outnumbered in the actual fighting.  However, the gong’s sound held a peculiar power.  Waves of light erupted, striking their comrades, who were instantly invigorated, their bodies gleaming like bronze, unyielding against the dragon-shaped blood energy of the Blood Yuan Banners.  In contrast, the Yan forces were thrown into disarray by the sound. Previous battles had followed a similar pattern.</p><p>A losing side, three thousand elite soldiers, were either slaughtered or captured, while the cultivators usually managed to escape.</p><p>Both sides offered various treasures and magical arts, yet the victory was decided by the flesh and blood of ordinary people, a sacrifice of countless lives.</p><p>Yu Lang didn't understand the agreement between the righteous and the evil sides. He only knew that if this continued, more and more people would die in vain.</p><p>"Again!"</p><p>The large chessboard was divided into smaller ones, and even on the smallest board, there were players and pawns.</p><p>In any game, ordinary people were just pawns, manipulated at will.</p><p>This was what Yu Lang deeply hated!</p><p>He had thought he could bring about change, but now he only felt powerless.</p><p>As the commander, he wasn't merely a figurehead; he decided on troop deployments and formations.  Yet after every battle, win or lose, Yu Lang felt only sorrow.</p><p>"Can Master change the situation?"</p><p>Yu Lang gazed at the vast sky, pondering silently.</p><p>In his heart, his Master was omnipotent.  Without encountering any danger, he had unhesitatingly used a bamboo slip for his belief.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A roar suddenly erupted on the battlefield.</p><p>The roar, emanating from the Yan soldiers, resembled a dragon's cry, a powerful sound like thunder, shaking the very soul.</p><p>The roar disrupted the drumbeat for a moment. Seizing the fleeting opportunity, the Yan forces surged forward, breaking through the enemy lines in one fell swoop.</p><p>'Clang! Clang! Clang!'</p><p>The cultivator frantically beat his drum. Seeing his side falling into chaos and unable to regroup, he immediately abandoned his soldiers and fled, vanishing in a flash of light.</p><p>He dared not linger; if caught by the dragon-like aura, his chances of survival were slim.</p><p>The Yan forces returned victorious, their faces beaming with joy.</p><p>A flicker of sadness crossed Yu Lang's eyes, a sigh escaping his lips.  Suddenly, he caught sight of a figure.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>The sight of his long-absent Master filled him with a mix of sorrow and joy.</p><p>He suddenly wondered if he, like his senior sister, should have chosen to return to the peaceful Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"You did well," Qin Sang surveyed the battlefield, offering praise without reservation.</p><p>This wasn't mere flattery. Yu Lang's ability to serve as commander-in-chief had indeed surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this disciple had done his utmost.</p><p>Most preciously, Yu Lang, despite the trials, had not changed his initial resolve.</p><p>Although Yu Lang's resolve differed from his own, Qin Sang was pleased that his disciple had managed to maintain it.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Yu Lang's eyes blurred, a torrent of emotions washing over him.</p><p>These emotions stemmed from his Master's affirmation and the experiences he'd endured.</p><p>At that moment, the defeated enemy sent another contingent onto the battlefield, raising a war cry.</p><p>From afar, all the soldiers were seen wearing wooden armor, made from an unknown type of wood.  Some parts even had branches sprouting out, bearing green leaves.</p><p>These men formed their ranks, standing firm as if rooted to the earth, immovable by any force.</p><p>"Please, General Qin, instruct us on whom to send against them!"</p><p>"Yuan Qing of Mount Yulong requests to fight!"</p><p>…</p><p>One by one, loud shouts rolled out from the Yan camp.</p><p>Yu Lang looked to his Master.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, sending a gentle breeze towards the enemy formation.  A series of cracking sounds followed.</p><p>The three thousand soldiers were shocked to find cracks appearing in their armor, shattering into pieces and falling off.</p><p>The feeling of standing firm on the earth, the unyielding stance, vanished. They felt light, and flew backward, tumbling like bowling pins, screaming in fright.</p><p>"Who dares to be so presumptuous!"</p><p>"What manner of person is this?!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's action immediately drew furious shouts, some even coming from the southern mountains.</p><p>In the next instant, figures flew out of the mountains.</p><p>The sky above the battlefield was instantly filled with hundreds of people, mainly Golden Core cultivators, but also several Yuan Ying ancestors with deep, powerful auras.</p><p>All eyes were focused on them.</p><p>Yu Lang's heart trembled, but with his Master beside him, he felt a sense of reassurance and no fear.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>From the opposite side, a middle-aged man stepped forward.</p><p>His appearance was unremarkable; his face was pale, his figure thin, as if he had been recovering from a serious illness.</p><p>However, the others showed respect upon seeing him, giving way willingly.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>A surprised voice came from the south, someone recognizing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways, recognizing Yin Heqian.  Nodding in acknowledgement, she turned to the middle-aged man, soared into the air, and smiled slightly. "With both sides' most powerful figures present, why this delay? When will the battle be decided? I haven't the patience to wait. Which of you will fight me?"</p><p>The middle-aged man frowned, looking towards the Kuang family ancestor, his gaze questioning.</p><p>The Kuang family ancestor summoned Yin Heqian, briefly inquired, and thoughtfully said, "This is General Qin's master, Qingfeng Daozhang?  Indeed, he has an extraordinary bearing…"</p><p>He flashed to Qin Sang's side and bowed. "I am Kuang Wujang.  Greetings, Daozhang."</p><p>"Daozhang Kuang is too kind."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's lack of arrogance, the Kuang family ancestor relaxed slightly, gesturing towards the Southern Mountain.  "We didn't expect your arrival, Daozhang. We have some fine tea and wine from the mountain gate.  Would you grace us with your presence?"</p><p>"Not yet!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved a hand. "We'll drink tea after we capture these demons."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The Kuang family ancestor frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked, "Daozhang Kuang, is there a problem? Or is it that among these demons, there's one with unparalleled power, and you are afraid to fight?"</p><p>This caused the Kuang family ancestor to feel a surge of anger, which he suppressed.  "Please, Daozhang, come to the Southern Mountain. I will explain."</p><p>"No need for such trouble. Even if there is an exceptionally powerful demon, I want to meet him, to learn his demonic arts! Since you're unwilling to come out, I'll go to you!"</p><p>The last sentence was shouted to the opposing side.</p><p>Before the words finished, a sword beam shot from Qin Sang's sleeve – not the Huiying Sword, but a casually selected spiritual sword.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword sang sharply. Before anyone could react, it struck towards the middle-aged man.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>The middle-aged man was startled and enraged, slapping his waist, sending a slender gray-white rope flying.  The rope, crystal-clear like a long tendon, was not made of ox or dragon sinew, but woven from countless human tendons – the Soul Tendon.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Soul Tendon whipped, emitting ghostly cries like countless vengeful spirits, chilling the soul.</p><p>Just as it was about to ensnare the spiritual sword, without any visible movement from Qin Sang, the sword light trembled, suddenly splitting into ten beams, which continued to multiply, in the blink of an eye becoming countless sword lights.</p><p>The middle-aged man felt a moment of confusion, then was surrounded by the sword lights, inescapable.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>The middle-aged man was alarmed, quickly recalling the Soul Tendon, but it was too late. All the sword lights vanished from his sight.</p><p>He knew they hadn't disappeared; he simply couldn't see them.  Only one possibility remained: he was trapped in a sword array!</p><p>The array was the Xuanji Sword Array, mastered by Qin Sang at the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, specializing in illusionary swordsmanship.</p><p>He was trapped in a single encounter.</p><p>Those watching were stunned.  The middle-aged man was a top-tier expert at the mid-Yuan Ying stage, known as the number one below the late Yuan Ying stage, and yet he was not a match for a single move.</p><p>Just what was this Qingfeng Daozhang’s background?</p><p>"Brother!"</p><p>A young man cried out, swiftly summoning a magic blade, slashing towards Qin Sang's head.  The blade's energy was razor-sharp.</p><p>But Qin Sang remained motionless, glancing at the Kuang family ancestor. "Daozhang, won't you make your move?"</p><p>"I…"</p><p>The Kuang family ancestor was momentarily at a loss.</p><p>The righteous and demonic paths had nothing to do with Yundou Tian or Luohun Yuan, but out of fear of their power, they had reluctantly agreed to a duel using ordinary people as pawns to determine victory, reducing unnecessary casualties.</p><p>This, of course, was contingent on the satisfaction of the two major forces; otherwise, they would have to fight personally. It was essentially a probe of the major forces' attitudes.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a troublemaker appeared.</p><p>Qingfeng Daozhang clearly sided with them.  The Kuang family ancestor couldn't simply watch him be attacked, so he summoned his spiritual sword, blocking the magic blade.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled knowingly, his sword techniques changing rapidly.  Inside the sword array, everything appeared chaotic. No one knew what was happening until the sword lights receded, returning.</p><p>Within them was a captured man.</p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes were wide with terror, his resistance gone, reduced to a prisoner.</p><p>Immediately, an uproar erupted.</p><p>The righteous path side was stunned, only hesitantly rushing forward after hearing Qin Sang shout, "What are you waiting for?"</p><p>The melee occurred unexpectedly.</p><p>Soon, escaping lights shot from all directions, their auras surpassing the middle-aged man, all late Yuan Ying stage experts and ancestors of various sects, shocked and furious at the loss of control.</p><p>What followed was shocking.  The demonic cultivators were no match for Qingfeng Daozhang, one after another falling in defeat.</p><p>Qin Sang stood suspended in the air, gazing towards a mountain miles away.  On the mountain, Yun Xian Shi and the cloaked person watched, their expressions stiff.</p><p>Since they wanted to draw her in, she would show them! This was just the beginning. Qin Sang would disrupt the game, until she forced the two Lianxu ancestors to appear!</p>
