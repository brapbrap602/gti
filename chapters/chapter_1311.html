Chapter 1303: The Scheme

When the heavens unleash their killing intent, stars shift and constellations change;
When the earth unleashes its killing intent, dragons and serpents rise from the land;
When man unleashes his killing intent, heaven and earth are overturned.
The so-called killing intent of man is profound and mysterious beyond measure.

The cultivators of the Sin Abyss came to understand that the killing intent of man must be sought from mortals. Thus, both righteous and demonic sects, breaking from their usual practices, sent their low-ranking disciples into the mortal world to control human kingdoms, stirring up chaos and inciting conflict.

From then on, the Sin Abyss was plagued by endless warfare. Corpses littered the fields, and rivers ran red with blood. Nine out of ten homes were left empty, countless families torn apart, and countless lives destroyed.

These mortals, enduring unimaginable suffering, still prayed to their immortal masters, begging for divine protection.

Little did they know, the immortal masters they revered were the very ones pulling the strings behind the scenes, manipulating everything. The immortal masters, lofty and aloof, coldly watched as mortals slaughtered one another, as if observing a herd of domesticated pigs.

Their goal was simple: to harvest the killing intent of man and refine it into elixirs.

Such actions bordered on demonic practices.

Yet the self-proclaimed righteous elders, including the Elder of Heavenly Justice and the True Lord Canghong, turned a blind eye. As for the demonic cultivators, they reveled in collecting souls, amassing enough to craft several sinister arts.

They succeeded in gathering the killing intent of man.

However, they soon realized that this method of collection was too slow, and for some reason, the killing intent was too impure. The scale of mortal wars was limited; even if entire kingdoms were destroyed, the amount collected would never suffice to meet the needs of the Nascent Soul cultivators.

During the hunt for the demonic overlord, most of the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Sin Abyss had been present and had contributed to the effort. Naturally, they demanded their share of the spoils. The Withered Origin Pills had to be distributed to everyone, or the Sin Abyss would risk immediate collapse.

The first batch of Withered Origin Pills was tested on selected Golden Core disciples who had failed to form their Nascent Souls and were nearing the end of their lifespans, with no hope of breaking through.

To everyone's shock, some of these disciples successfully formed their Nascent Souls after consuming the pills, and their new Nascent Souls showed no signs of instability.

Once the efficacy of the Withered Origin Pills was confirmed, there was no turning back.

Next, they turned their attention to cultivators themselves.

The killing intent of man might be found within themselves.

Cultivators were, after all, merely humans who wielded immense power!

They provoked the Heavenly Alliance on the grasslands, ultimately confirming that this plan was feasible.

Cultivators far surpassed mortals in strength, and the intensity of their wars was incomparable. The killing intent collected from them was far more refined.

The Sin Abyss reached a consensus. Experts from both the righteous and demonic paths gathered at the Starstead Sect, forming an alliance and deciding to launch a war against the Heavenly Alliance!

Of course, the official reason was not to refine pills.

The low-ranking cultivators of the Sin Abyss, once the players of the game, had now become the pawns.

"Perhaps there are ambitious individuals among them, seeking to dominate. But for most, the purpose of this war was not conquest. The stalemate in the earlier stages of the war was, in fact, deliberately orchestrated."

Hearing Qu Huan's words, everyone understood the truth and couldn't help but feel furious.

Only now did they realize the true intentions of the Sin Abyss's higher-ups. They were all pawns in the Sin Abyss's game! If the Sin Abyss had been fighting for survival due to dwindling resources, they wouldn't have been so enraged.

"Using the killing intent of man to refine pills, and with a formula obtained from soul-searching a demonic overlord—how dare they consume such a thing!"

The Netherfiend Demon Lord snorted coldly.

The origin and method of refining the Withered Origin Pills were clearly not benign.

"The fragmented memories obtained from soul-searching, the secrets of the Blood Lake, and the passage between the two palaces were all corroborated, indirectly increasing the credibility of the Withered Origin Pills. Even so, they were cautious and did not blindly consume them. Over the past century, various sects selected Golden Core disciples to consume the pills, leading to a significant increase in the number of Nascent Souls in the Sin Abyss. With this newfound strength, they could easily contend with two regions. The newly ascended Nascent Souls were unaware of the pills' origins; they were, in fact, test subjects. The old masters had been observing the changes in those who consumed the pills..."

Qu Huan paused, then added with a hint of bitterness, "Of course, some couldn't resist the temptation of the Withered Origin Pills and secretly consumed them to break through. And there were quite a few of them. Elder Feng was one of them, and he paid a heavy price for it."

The war between the three regions lasted nearly two hundred years.

Over such a long period, those who had consumed the Withered Origin Pills showed no signs of adverse effects. Even the most patient Nascent Souls of the Sin Abyss began to grow restless.

Qu Huan shuddered at the thought; he had nearly succumbed to the temptation himself.

"What was the price?"

Qin Sang recalled his senior sister's earlier words. "So many people died at the hands of Elder Ye. Was it because of the Withered Origin Pills?"

"Exactly!"

Qu Huan nodded slightly. "Early this morning, all the Nascent Souls of the Sin Abyss gathered in Yu City to discuss important matters. Elder Ye suddenly struck. All those who had consumed the Withered Origin Pills simultaneously suffered from the hidden flaws. In the blink of an eye, Elder Feng and others experienced a rapid loss of vitality, their cultivation plummeting, and their souls withering. Their essence, energy, and spirit—all three were in decline!"

"Hisss!"

Qin Sang and the others gasped in shock.

Essence, energy, and spirit were the foundation of a cultivator. Any one of them faltering was a serious issue, but all three declining simultaneously? There was no cure!

"The newly ascended Nascent Souls suffered the most. Aside from those who had formed their Nascent Souls through their own efforts, the rest had relied on the power of the Withered Origin Pills. Their Nascent Souls were on the verge of collapse, leaving them utterly defenseless against Elder Ye. The older masters fared slightly better, but those who had consumed too many Withered Origin Pills also had little ability to resist. Their Nascent Souls were captured on the spot by Elder Ye..."

As Qu Huan recalled the scene, a trace of horror still lingered in his expression.

Elder Ye bared his fangs, and before everyone's eyes, he reaped half of the Nascent Souls like harvesting vegetables. By the time the others realized what was happening, it was too late to stop him.

"Looking back now, there were signs. Half a year ago, Elder Ye was ambushed and injured. It must have been deliberate. From then on, the Sin Abyss suffered defeat after defeat, forcing them to retreat to Yu City, where all the Nascent Souls had the opportunity to gather.

"In my opinion, the ancient cultivators likely used the Withered Origin Pills on the battlefield to instantly boost their strength and defeat their enemies, but the consequences were dire.

"Elder Ye must have used some secret technique to delay the onset of the hidden flaws. Today, he revealed his true intentions!

"It's likely related to the Nethercrystal Tower. When he fled, Elder Ye not only destroyed the tower but also took all the crystals from its peak.

"Centuries ago, when the demonic overlord appeared, it was all part of Elder Ye's scheme from the very beginning!"

Qu Huan's words laid bare the brutal truth of the cultivation world.

Low-ranking cultivators were sent into the mortal world to incite greed and drive mortals to kill one another.

Soon after, they were thrown into the battlefield of cultivators, becoming test subjects for the Withered Origin Pills.

But even the Nascent Soul elders were merely pawns in Elder Ye's hands, ultimately harvested by him.

Thinking themselves the players of the game, they were all trapped in the scheme. How many were truly innocent?

After this upheaval, not only had half of the Nascent Souls been lost, but those who had consumed the Withered Origin Pills were also plagued by the hidden flaws, their strength greatly diminished. They were barely holding on, and no one knew what their ultimate fate would be.

It was after witnessing the Sin Abyss's impending doom that Qu Huan fully aligned himself with the alliance of the two regions.
