<h1>Chapter 521 Reincarnation</h1><p>The lower layers of Vital Qi are impure, but easier to refine, making them more suitable for disciples with lower cultivation levels to absorb.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang fixed his gaze on the fire god-like phantom at the mountain peak, staring for a long time.</p><p>"This is the Ancestral Sacred Flame they speak of..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, his face filled with awe.</p><p>The god-like flames soared above the highest heavens, as if they were about to burn through the sky!</p><p>Although he had long heard of how frenzied and terrifying the Ancestral Sacred Flame at the peak of Sacred罡 Peak was, now that he finally witnessed it with his own eyes, Qin Sang was still deeply shocked.</p><p>He thought that the Nine Nether Demonic Flame within the Ten Yama Banners was not only strange but also extremely powerful, but compared to the aura emanating from the Ancestral Sacred Flame, it was like a firefly compared to the sun.</p><p>Qin Sang had once sensed the aura emanating from the Nascent Soul battles in the Boundless Valley.  Comparing it now to the Ancestral Sacred Flame, he felt that it was somewhat inferior.</p><p>As for how great the difference between the two was, Qin Sang couldn't say for sure.</p><p>Firstly, both times he was very far away, so his perception wasn't clear.</p><p>Secondly, both powers were beyond Qin Sang's current understanding, and he didn't have the ability to fully comprehend them.</p><p>He could only vaguely sense that the Ancestral Sacred Flame was terrifyingly powerful and extremely violent!</p><p>It was said that the Ancestral Sacred Flame wasn't originally present, but was related to the first Patriarch of the Azure Yang Devil Sect, the very same senior who discovered the Azure Yang Vital Essence and founded the sect here.</p><p>This was precisely why it was called the Ancestral Sacred Flame.</p><p>After watching the Ancestral Sacred Flame for a while, Qin Sang looked past Sacred罡 Peak, towards the distance.</p><p>Not far behind Sacred罡 Peak was the forbidden area of the Azure Yang Devil Sect.</p><p>Clouds gathered there like a canopy, shrouding the area, clearly sealed by a grand formation. Inside lay the Azure Yang Devil Sect's treasure trove and the ancestral caves.</p><p>This formation was no ordinary one; it was even more mysterious than the sect's protective formation. Strangely, this formation didn't encompass Sacred罡 Peak, the most important location of the Azure Yang Devil Sect.</p><p>Could it be related to the Ancestral Sacred Flame?</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes. The Ancestral Sacred Flame was so violent. If the cloud canopy covered it and the Azure Yang Devil Sect didn't have a method to suppress it, the formation could easily be destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of the two Nascent Soul cultivators who invaded the Azure Yang Devil Sect years ago and then abruptly retreated, keeping the details of that battle a closely guarded secret. Could it be related to the Ancestral Sacred Flame?</p><p>If the Azure Yang Devil Sect was driven to desperation and detonated the Ancestral Sacred Flame, even powerful Nascent Soul cultivators would find it difficult to escape unscathed, wouldn't they?</p><p>Of the four Golden Core cultivators of the Azure Yang Devil Sect, only one should be left in the sect now, but Qin Sang didn't know where his cave was.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the forbidden area, then back at Sacred罡 Peak. He hadn't been able to find out where the Golden Core cultivator usually cultivated, so he would have to be careful in the future.</p><p>After a full two hours, Qin Sang had seen enough of the inner sect of the Azure Yang Devil Sect.  Suddenly, he noticed a figure breaking through the green mist on Sacred罡 Peak – it was Shi Ying.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly restored the restriction and lay back in the black coffin.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Shi Ying flashed into the cave, hurriedly closed the restriction, and sat cross-legged beside the coffin.</p><p>Fatigue was evident on her face, as if the trip to Sacred罡 Peak had consumed a great deal of her energy.</p><p>After a brief period of adjusting her breath, Shi Ying gathered her spirit, stretched out her hands, and placed them flat in front of her dantian.</p><p>Immediately, spiritual power swirled in her palms.  Strangely, her spiritual power shimmered with a cyan light, dyeing the inside of the cave cyan as well.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Suddenly, a small flame appeared amidst the swirling spiritual power and rapidly devoured it, quickly growing into a ball of cyan fire.</p><p>This was the Azure Yang Demonic Flame!</p><p>Unlike ordinary flames with scorching temperatures, the Azure Yang Demonic Flame emitted a cool aura, appearing harmless, but in reality, it was extremely insidious and feared by cultivators outside the sect.</p><p>Those who were enemies of the Azure Yang Devil Sect not only had to be wary of their magical artifacts but also constantly vigilant against the Azure Yang Demonic Flame, making sure not to be touched by it.</p><p>Fortunately, using the Azure Yang Demonic Flame consumed a great deal of energy for Azure Yang Devil Sect cultivators, making it impossible to use continuously. Especially disciples below the tenth level of Qi Refining, who could only use the Demonic Flame to maintain their cultivation and were unable to use it in combat.</p><p>In Shi Ying's hands, this ball of Azure Yang Demonic Flame was very docile, swaying gently.</p><p>However, Shi Ying's eyes were somewhat tense as she stared intently at the depths of the Azure Yang Demonic Flame.</p><p>If one looked closely, they could see a thread-like, cyan light within the core of the flame, even more vibrant than the Demonic Flame itself.</p><p>This cyan light moved like a fish, swimming ceaselessly within the flame's core.</p><p>It tried to break free, but was firmly trapped within the Azure Yang Demonic Flame.</p><p>After summoning the Demonic Flame, Shi Ying's face paled slightly.</p><p>Her usual cultivation involved absorbing a trace of Azure Yang Vital Essence on Sacred罡 Peak, refining it into her Demonic Flame, and then returning to her cave to slowly refine it further.</p><p>Only after completely refining the Azure Yang Vital Essence would she return to Sacred罡 Peak, repeating this cycle.</p><p>This was the first time she had attempted to bring the Azure Yang Vital Essence out of the mountain.</p><p>The Azure Yang Demonic Flame originated from the Azure Yang Vital Essence.  Being of the same source, Shi Ying succeeded in sealing a trace of the Azure Yang Vital Essence after a few attempts.</p><p>However, she hadn't expected the Azure Yang Vital Essence to be so unstable.  The first time, it dissipated before she could even leave the mountain.</p><p>To prevent this strand of Azure Yang Vital Essence from dissipating, Shi Ying gathered and dispersed it repeatedly for over an hour.  Finally, after becoming proficient, she successfully brought out a trace.</p><p>"Condense!"</p><p>Shi Ying stared at the flame's core and shouted softly.</p><p>The Demonic Flame surged, pressing inwards. The strand of Azure Yang Vital Essence trembled violently, then compressed from both ends towards the middle, finally transforming into a tiny droplet, as green and lustrous as condensed dew.</p><p>After stabilizing the Azure Yang Vital Essence, Shi Ying waved her sleeve, opening the black coffin and commanding the refined corpse to sit cross-legged before her.</p><p>The next step was to attempt the Vital Essence and Death Essence Pill Infusion.</p><p>The jade slip's secret technique detailed the process of the Vital Essence and Death Essence Pill Infusion.  It seemed plausible and stated that as long as she used the refined corpse's power to suppress the three divine objects and her movements were sufficiently careful and precise, there would be no danger.</p><p>But Shi Ying was still apprehensive.</p><p>She wasn't a newcomer to the world of cultivation. Even if she hadn't personally experienced certain things, she had heard of them.</p><p>The Pure Yang Vital Qi, Earthly Yin Death Essence, and Golden Core were all far beyond her control. If anything went wrong, her life would be in danger.</p><p>When she left the cave earlier, she had taken the opportunity to check the sect's archives but couldn't find any mention of the "Ancient Corpse Sect" mentioned in the jade slip. She subtly inquired with the uncle guarding the archives, but he hadn't heard of it either.</p><p>Therefore, Shi Ying decided to suppress her impatience and proceed slowly, testing the feasibility of the secret technique in the jade slip before deciding whether to risk everything.</p><p>With a thought, she separated a strand of the Azure Yang Demonic Flame, transforming it into a fiery blade. She carefully probed the flame's core, slicing off an even smaller trace of the Azure Yang Vital Essence.</p><p>The Demonic Flame enveloped the Azure Yang Vital Essence and slowly floated towards the refined corpse.</p><p>At the same time, Shi Ying focused on controlling the refined corpse, preparing it for the impact of the Azure Yang Vital Essence.</p><p>At this moment, Shi Ying felt that the refined corpse was even more responsive than before, incredibly docile and obedient, which boosted her confidence.</p><p>"Brother Refined Corpse, we must succeed! As long as I avenge my grievances, I swear I will set you free and find a way for your soul to rest in peace and be reincarnated."</p>
