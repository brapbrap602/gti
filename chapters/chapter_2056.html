<h1>Chapter 2047: The Kirin Stirs</h1><p>Returning to Luo Hua Guan, Qin Sang did not immediately emerge from seclusion after recovering. He meticulously recalled the details of the treasure refinement process, organizing his thoughts and comparing them with his understanding of the Dao of Artifact Refinement, feeling greatly benefited.</p><p>Having summarized his insights, Qin Sang finally emerged from seclusion and saw Yu Hong Zhenren guarding outside.</p><p>“Have our fellow Daoists departed?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Yu Hong Zhenren replied, “Tong Hu Zhenren is still in seclusion. The other seniors, at the invitation of the Guan Master, are still guests within the mountain.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, knowing that Shuang Hua Furen and the others likely shared his thoughts and thus had not left.</p><p>“Reporting to Elder Qin, this junior has selected a few promising members from the Ju Fu Clan for Elder Qin to choose from,” Yu Hong Zhenren continued.</p><p>Qin Sang acknowledged, “The Guan Master and Zhenren have taken great pains. Where are they now?”</p><p>Yu Hong Zhenren pointed down the mountain. “They are all waiting in the huts at the foot of the mountain. If Elder Qin is interested, this junior will bring them up.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang, and he stopped Yu Hong Zhenren from descending. “Let them ascend the mountain themselves.”</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang waved his right arm, releasing a wisp of spiritual power that transformed into mist in midair, gently falling and enveloping the entire mountain. He then sat cross-legged on a nearby rock.</p><p>Activating his spirit eyes, Yu Hong Zhenren saw several simple barriers set within the white mist.  Knowing that Qin Sang intended to test them, he remained where he was and used a spell to transmit his voice to the foot of the mountain.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, nestled amongst the bamboo forest, were rows of huts.  A dozen or so members of the Ju Fu Clan, both male and female, were cultivating within, refining their Qi and adjusting their breath.  Qin Sang worried that the Ju Fu Clan felt too attached to Luo Hua Guan, so he set a requirement for their cultivation, roughly equivalent to the Nascent Soul stage of humans, still leaving room for improvement.</p><p>From birth, they had been instilled with the notion that Luo Hua Guan was their superior sect. To be chosen by a Zhenren of the superior sect to serve was their greatest honor.</p><p>The entire clan looked up to the Guan Master's elders as role models.</p><p>Now, presented with an opportunity to serve a powerful cultivator on par with the Guan Master, these Ju Fu Clan members viewed it as the greatest opportunity of their lives and were determined to strive for it, not daring to slack off in the slightest.</p><p>While they were diligently cultivating, Yu Hong Shangzhen’s voice transmission reached their ears.  Their spirits lifted, and they pushed open the doors of their huts, only to be surprised to find a world of white outside, unable to see anything.</p><p>Their huts were closely packed together, mere steps from their companions, yet they couldn't sense each other's presence.</p><p>Recalling the content of the voice transmission, they could only suppress their unease and proceed towards the summit alone.  With their first step, they discovered another peculiarity.  An invisible pressure descended from the void, pinning them firmly to the ground. Not only could they not fly, but their Qi and blood circulation was also hampered.  Attempting to utilize their divine abilities, they felt an additional layer of obstruction, increasing their energy consumption severalfold.  All their usual reliance was rendered useless, and every step upward became incredibly difficult.</p><p>Unaware of what awaited them ahead, some felt apprehensive, while others quickly calmed their minds and climbed one step at a time.</p><p>Within the white mist, a dozen figures crawled towards the summit, gradually widening the distance between them.</p><p>Yu Hong Zhenren observed this, thinking to himself that these Ju Fu Clan members were the elite of their clan, with varying levels of talent.  But judging by the barriers Qin Sang had set, he clearly valued their character and resilience more.</p><p>Even for attendants, Qin Sang didn't want to bring along any riffraff.</p><p>The test lasted for more than half a day before the first Ju Fu Clan member broke through the mist and reached the summit.</p><p>He was near exhaustion, drenched in sweat, and wanted nothing more than to lie down and sleep.  Seeing Qin Sang and Yu Hong Zhenren, he was about to offer a salute when he suddenly heard someone shout from behind, “Big Brother!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze flickered. With another wave of his hand, the mist instantly dispersed.  Those still struggling within the mist were gently sent back to the foot of the mountain by a soft force.  They knew they had been eliminated, and their frustration was evident.</p><p>The first to arrive at the summit were actually two brothers, who stepped forward together and bowed.  “Greetings to the two Shangzhen!”</p><p>Both brothers felt apprehensive, fearing the Shangzhen would only accept one and separate them.</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, “What are your names?”</p><p>“This one is called Qing Jia!”</p><p>“This one is called Qing Yi!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Yu Hong Zhenren. “These two will do.  May I ask your esteemed Guan to part with them?”</p><p>Yu Hong Zhenren readily agreed and immediately said to the two brothers, “Hurry and pay your respects to Elder Qin!”</p><p>“This old man has several spirit beasts who all address this old man as 'Great Master.'  You will do the same. Your cultivation is too low, and you must cultivate diligently, or you won't even be qualified to guard this old man's cave dwelling,” Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>Both brothers were filled with awe and knelt, exclaiming, “We will heed Great Master's teachings!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction, about to inquire about the differences between the Yi Ren Clan's cultivation and that of humans, when he suddenly felt something, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes. He stood up and said to Yu Hong Zhenren, “I have yet to fully comprehend some aspects of my previous gains. Please don't disturb Shuang Hua Furen and the others.  Inform me when Tong Hu Zhenren emerges from seclusion.”</p><p>Then, ordering Qing Jia and Qing Yi to stand guard outside, Qin Sang hurried into his meditation chamber and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Just now, he had suddenly felt a strange fluctuation from the fire lotus within his Purple Mansion.  The Kirin Source Seed seemed to be stirring!</p><p>It had been about eight hundred years since he had incorporated the Kirin Source Seed into the lotus heart, incubating it within the fire lotus according to Zhu Que's instructions.  This was the first time the Kirin Source Seed had shown any activity, besides being intentionally activated by Qin Sang.</p><p>When he initially refined the Kirin Source Seed, Qin Sang hadn’t anticipated it would take so long, spanning the entire Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Now, he finally saw a glimmer of hope!</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the cave dwelling and set up another array flag before eagerly summoning the fire lotus.</p><p>With a flash of firelight from his brow, the fire lotus slowly emerged, appearing much the same as before.</p><p>“Something happening?”</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang summoning the fire lotus, Zhu Que flew out, gazing at the lotus heart with great anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent. With a thought, the lotus petals unfolded layer by layer, revealing the ‘lotus seed’ – the Kirin Source Seed.</p><p>Over the centuries, Qin Sang had continuously extracted essence from the Kirin Source Seed. Later, under Zhu Que’s guidance, he changed his strategy to incubate the Kirin True Spirit. Now, a deep connection had formed between him and the seed.</p><p>It still looked like a lotus seed, but the essence within had nearly been depleted.  The current seed was almost entirely woven by Qin Sang, bit by bit, using his divine sense as a substitute.</p><p>In fact, during the process of extracting essence from the Kirin Source Seed, Qin Sang’s divine sense had been continuously growing.  However, most of it was still tied to the Kirin Source Seed, and he hadn't directly benefited from it. The growth of his external divine sense was due to the improvement of his cultivation, so it didn't offer much advantage compared to cultivators of the same level.</p><p>Worried that the Kirin might have some hidden tricks up its sleeve, Qin Sang was extremely cautious in his every move, meticulously preventing the complete annihilation of the Kirin True Spirit's nascent consciousness. This part of his divine sense, born from devouring the Kirin’s essence, could mimic a similar aura and thus deceive the Kirin True Spirit.</p><p>The Kirin Source Seed was like a cocoon. The creature inside was still alive, but the outer shell had been unknowingly replaced.</p><p>Despite having reached this stage, Qin Sang still didn’t dare to rashly activate the Kirin True Spirit, proceeding with extreme caution.  Every so often, he would carefully transfer a sliver of essence to it, preferring insufficiency to excess. The Kirin True Spirit gradually grew stronger in this subtle way, but it still showed no signs of awakening.</p><p>Comparatively, the Kirin True Spirit was like Luo Hua Zhenren’s jade ruler – a chaotic mass of spirituality, unable to birth true consciousness, or perhaps its consciousness remained dormant.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of any better solution and could only let it evolve on its own.</p><p>Now, the Kirin True Spirit was finally reacting!</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the fire lotus, watching the heart flicker unsteadily, influenced by the Kirin Source Seed’s pulsations.</p><p>This fluctuation was actually very weak, and Qin Sang did not sense a true consciousness from it. However, after some investigation, he gained a vague understanding.  The Kirin Source Seed was closely related to the «Fire Seed Golden Lotus» technique.  He only needed to fully activate this technique to potentially usher in some kind of transformation.</p><p>Just as he was about to activate the secret technique, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and stopped.</p><p>“Why stop?!”</p><p>Zhu Que cried out, extremely dissatisfied.</p><p>It had long coveted the Kirin, and whether it could find the Kirin’s origin was crucial to its own cultivation recovery.</p><p>It also harbored a secret ambition.  To one day be able to call Qin Sang “Little Qin” would be incredibly satisfying!</p><p>At this critical juncture, Qin Sang stopped, and Zhu Que fumed.</p><p>Qin Sang considered that they were within another sect's territory. If any commotion arose, or even a heavenly tribulation was triggered, it would cause an unwanted disturbance.</p><p>This wasn't impossible. He didn't know how long the Kirin had slumbered or what methods it used to avoid heavenly tribulation.  He had to make proper arrangements before taking action.</p><p>Ignoring Zhu Que's discontent, Qin Sang waited a while longer. Seeing that the fluctuation hadn't disappeared, he withdrew the fire lotus into his Purple Mansion.</p><p>Examining the Kirin Source Seed took several days.  Shortly afterward, Yu Hong Zhenren reported that Tong Hu Zhenren had emerged from seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang exited his meditation chamber and saw Qing Jia and Qing Yi diligently guarding outside.  He said, “We will be leaving soon. Go bid farewell to your families. These pills can temper the physique and strengthen the body. Your Ju Fu Clan should also be able to refine and absorb them. Consider it a gift from this old man to them.”</p><p>“Thank you, Great Master, for the pills!”</p><p>Both brothers were filled with gratitude, knowing they had chosen the right master. Joy tempered the sadness of parting with their families.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the two and flew towards Shuang Hua Furen’s meditation chamber with Yu Hong Zhenren.</p><p>“Elder Qin has arrived!”</p><p>Everyone was there, rising to greet him.</p><p>Having refined the treasure together, they were now familiar with each other and dispensed with formalities.  After settling down, Shuang Hua Furen spoke, “Elder Qin, thanks to the Guan Master’s invitation, we have all benefited greatly this time.  This concubine and fellow Daoists have discussed holding a small Dao Discourse Conference to exchange our insights on artifact refinement.  What are Elder Qin’s thoughts?”</p><p>This coincided with Qin Sang's own intentions, and he immediately agreed, “This one couldn’t ask for more!”</p><p>Shuang Hua Furen nodded happily. “It's a pity the spirit treasure's transformation failed. Luo Hua Guan seems to have some important matters to attend to. The Guan Master and Quan Zhenren have entered seclusion one after another, and it's inconvenient to disturb them.  In this concubine’s opinion, we have already imposed on Luo Hua Guan for a long time.  Why don't we choose a location outside as the venue for our Dao Discourse?”</p><p>Everyone agreed and left the meditation chamber, flying together towards the main peak.</p><p>The current acting head of Luo Hua Guan was a female cultivator named Qi Luo Zhenren.  Qi Luo Zhenren invited them to stay a few more days, but they politely declined.</p><p>“We should wait for the Guan Master and Quan Zhenren to emerge from seclusion and bid farewell in person, but we have many matters to attend to and dare not stay any longer. Please convey our farewells to Qi Luo Zhenren. We shall take our leave now!”</p><p>Qi Luo Zhenren opened the mountain gates wide, sending the Zhenren outside. She waited a while longer, and Qing Jia and Qing Yi hurried over. Qin Sang summoned a cloud beneath his feet, enveloping the two brothers, and flew away with Shuang Hua Furen and the others.</p><p>The group flew towards Yan Ling City. Tong Hu Zhenren recalled an uninhabited island along the way with breathtaking scenery and suggested they go there.</p><p>Upon arrival, the island truly boasted picturesque peaks and beautiful waters.  If not for its sparse spiritual energy, it would have long been occupied by cultivators.</p><p>They descended upon a mountain peak and sat beside a flowing spring.  Each took out immortal fruits and fine wine, placing them on the surface of the spring, letting the current carry them.  Qing Jia, Qing Yi, and Shuang Hua Furen’s daughter stood respectfully by their side.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, you should still remember the secret technique the Guan Master employed through us, right?”</p><p>This was the true purpose of this Dao Discourse Conference.  Just as they settled down, Tong Hu Zhenren couldn't contain himself and brought it up.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances and nodded slightly.</p><p>By combining the portions of the secret technique each of them had learned, even if they couldn't reconstruct the complete technique, with the combined efforts of these artifact refinement Grandmasters, they might be able to comprehend a unique secret technique.</p><p>Shuang Hua Furen, having the highest cultivation, presided over the conference.  She opened her lips and eloquently described her gains from the treasure refinement process.</p><p>Everyone listened attentively.  After a while, realizing that Shuang Hua Furen was holding almost nothing back, they were moved and focused their attention even more.</p><p>Shuang Hua Furen's voice was like celestial music.  They forgot to taste the immortal fruits and fine wine before them.  Even after she finished speaking, the lingering sound resonated, captivating them and leaving them speechless.  For a long while, no one spoke, only the sound of the clear spring flowing.</p><p>They didn't rush to exchange ideas.  Next, it was the strange man’s turn to explain.  The male head and female head spoke in turn, one sentence each, but their train of thought was remarkably clear and peculiar.</p><p>With Shuang Hua Furen's example, the others couldn't bring themselves to hold back either. Even Qin Sang shared his understanding.</p><p>It was important to note that what they shared included not only the Luo Hua Guan secret technique but also their unique insights based on their own inheritances, offering valuable inspiration to others.</p><p>After each had shared, they began to take turns clarifying doubts, and then each continued to expound on their understanding.</p><p>The sun rose and the moon set.</p><p>Engrossed in their discussions of the profound Dao, they lost track of time, oblivious to the wildflowers by the spring blooming and wilting, turning autumn yellow, and then entering the depths of winter.  The stems above ground withered, while the roots preserved their vitality, buried deep beneath the snow, awaiting the arrival of spring.</p><p>Countless dawns and dusks passed.</p><p>Finally, Tong Hu Zhenren let out a long sigh and stretched.</p><p>Everyone seemed to awaken from a dream and felt the coldness of the stone beneath them.</p><p>The Yu surname cultivator brushed his hand over the surface, melting the ice. He picked up the jade cup before him, drained it in one gulp, and exclaimed with satisfaction, “Now this trip has been worthwhile!”</p><p>Everyone wholeheartedly agreed and looked towards Shuang Hua Furen.</p><p>Shuang Hua Furen used her finger as a brush, channeling her True Essence and drawing in the air.  Luminous characters were born at her fingertips, eventually forming a profound chapter.</p><p>“We came because of Luo Hua. This chapter is derived from Luo Hua’s technique.  When casting it, one feels as if in a dream.  Let's call it «Luo Hua Dream Interpretation». What do you think, fellow Daoists?”</p><p>Shuang Hua Furen glanced around, seeing everyone nodding in agreement.  She then wrote these four characters at the top, took out five blank jade slips, and inscribed the chapter onto them.  Each person received one.</p><p>()</p>
