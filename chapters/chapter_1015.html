<h1>Chapter 1007 Reunion</h1><p>Zou Family Island.</p><p>This island is home to a cultivator family surnamed Zou.  Legend says their ancestor was a Yuan Ying master, and the island retains its name in their honor.</p><p>After the Yuan Ying master passed away, the Zou family gradually declined.</p><p>However, even a weakened Zou family still surpasses most smaller sects. They remain relatively well-known in the nearby seas' cultivation world.</p><p>The previous Zou family head was a top-tier expert, second only to a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>For unknown reasons, the previous head suddenly resigned, passing the position to a younger generation and embarking on a solitary journey.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Zou family prospered even more afterward, their members seemingly acquiring great wealth.</p><p>Unexpectedly, twenty years ago, the Zou family declared the island closed off.</p><p>Only two years ago did Zou family disciples reappear, acting with extreme discretion.</p><p>The reasons behind these events remain a mystery to outsiders.</p><p>Zou Family Island is not only home to the Zou family but also many ordinary people who live peacefully under their protection.</p><p>In one of the ordinary people's cities on the island.</p><p>An unremarkable-looking man entered the city, seemingly wandering aimlessly before leaving.</p><p>Once away from prying eyes, his appearance shifted, revealing him to be Qin Sang.</p><p>"So the Zou family has such a history.  Their ancestral cultivation grounds must be heavily guarded by formations. It seems sneaking to the tomb to pay respects to Old Master Zou and return the jade pendant will be difficult…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, and silently flew towards the heart of Zou Family Island.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang appeared in a forest, seeing the misty mountain peaks ahead and muttering to herself, "As expected."</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang quietly retreated.</p><p>In the largest ordinary people's city on the island.</p><p>A magnificent palace stands, rumored to be the dwelling place of immortals.</p><p>Ordinary people dare not approach, only gazing from afar at the palace's splendor.</p><p>This palace is the residence of Zou family members who were sent to handle mundane affairs, their immortal path seemingly hopeless.</p><p>Inside the palace, an old man with white hair and beard knelt, tending to the garden like a farmer.</p><p>The old man was surprisingly a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Amazingly, the garden contained no spiritual flowers, only common earthly plants. Yet, the old man worked meticulously, his movements gentle and focused.</p><p>After a while.</p><p>The old man stood, surveyed his work with satisfaction, and turned toward the house.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>The smile on the old man's face froze.</p><p>A jade pendant suddenly appeared on the previously empty table, someone having entered undetected.</p><p>The old man broke into a cold sweat, his spiritual sense sweeping the surroundings, but finding no one.</p><p>Then, he noticed an inscription on the table.</p><p>"To the departed, returning what was lost."</p><p>The old man was startled.  He cautiously approached, picked up the jade pendant, and his expression suddenly changed.  He quickly left the city and flew towards the main Zou family area.</p><p>Regardless of the Zou family's reaction, Qin Sang left after returning Old Master Zou's belongings.</p><p>…</p><p>A flying vehicle sped across the boundless sea.</p><p>A white crane served as the charioteer.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned on the railing, gazing out.</p><p>In a short while, the outline of a large island appeared on the horizon.</p><p>Qin Sang called back the white crane, and with a flash, she landed on the island.</p><p>Entering the city, Qin Sang went straight to the cave dwelling, finding it empty. Bai hadn't returned, and neither was Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>"It's still more than a month until our meeting…"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, deciding against taking any action. Before leaving, Ning Wu Hui mentioned that he might not stay at the Heavenly Dao Sect and would travel elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in the cave dwelling for quiet cultivation.</p><p>Fifteen days passed quickly.</p><p>While cultivating, Qin Sang suddenly sensed a disturbance in the cave's formation.  Her spiritual sense swept outward, revealing Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>"Daoist Ning!"</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted, hurrying out to greet him.</p><p>"Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Ning Wu Hui bowed.</p><p>"Daoist Ning, have you found out anything? Is there a confirmed time for the Seven Kills Hall's appearance?"</p><p>As soon as they entered the cave, Qin Sang eagerly asked.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui nodded. "Daoist Qin, don't worry. Several elders from the Heavenly Dao Sect have been monitoring the changes in the Seven Kills Hall's immortal array in the Storm Belt. It's said to be within two years."</p><p>"Two years. It seems I can only continue to cultivate and wait…"</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement, then suddenly remembered something. "Legend says that those who enter the inner hall of the Seven Kills Hall when it opens have a chance to gain benefits. Is that true?"</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had focused on returning to Xiao Han Domain, mainly inquiring about the outer hall of the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Having decided to enter the inner hall, Qin Sang naturally inquired thoroughly on Tianxing Island.</p><p>Rumors about the inner hall of the Seven Kills Hall are mostly unreliable.</p><p>Qin Sang, now far stronger than before and with greater access to higher-level cultivators, managed to gather some useful information after paying a substantial fee.  However, the veracity of this information remained questionable, leaving him no choice but to consult Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui, unsurprisingly, was knowledgeable about the matter.  "It's true," she said.  "They say that after entering the inner sanctum of the Seven Killing Hall, one must undergo a trial. Those who successfully complete it are rewarded with treasures. I heard that this trial was left behind by an ancestor to ensure the enduring prosperity of our human race. But passing this trial isn't easy; it's extremely dangerous…"</p><p>"Is it rumored that the Seven Killing Hall was perhaps first discovered by the Four Saints, and that the ancestor who left behind the trial was one of them?"  Qin Sang recalled the Four Saints' Mountain on Tian Xing Island.</p><p>"Perhaps," Ning Wu Hui replied uncertainly.  "The era of the Four Saints is incredibly distant. Many secrets are lost to time, leaving behind only rumors and legends."</p><p>Intrigued by the Four Saints, Qin Sang mused, "If they discovered the Seven Killing Hall, they must have obtained countless treasures to turn the tide and repel the Witch Clan! I wonder what cultivation level they reached, and if they ever traversed the Storm Belt to other cultivation realms."</p><p>There are no legends about the Four Saints in the Xiao Han domain.  Perhaps they never went there, or perhaps they were exceptionally discreet. Qin Sang judged the former more likely; otherwise, they would surely have clashed with cultivators in the Zi Wei Palace, leaving behind some trace.</p><p>The fact that even the Four Saints didn't know about the existence of the ancient teleportation array highlights just how well-hidden it was. Without Elder Qing Zhu's help, finding it alone would have been practically impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ning Wu Hui spent a considerable time in private discussion within the cave abode.</p><p>After seeing Ning Wu Hui off, Qin Sang stood before the cave entrance, his brow furrowed. The agreed-upon time was fast approaching, yet there was still no news from Bai.</p><p>It wasn't until the day before their meeting that Bai rushed back.  Relieved to see Bai unharmed, Qin Sang noticed his significantly weakened state and immediately asked, "Friend, did you encounter a formidable enemy?"</p><p>Bai sighed.  "Not an enemy, but I was unexpectedly trapped somewhere for several months.  I almost missed our appointment. Sadly, I didn't find anything useful."</p>
