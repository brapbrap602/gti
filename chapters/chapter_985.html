<h1>Chapter 977: A Bond Formed</h1><p>Chapter 977: A Bond Formed</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Qin Sang was diligently refining a magic banner.</p><p>He subtly shifted his expression, slowly opening his eyes to look outside the cave.  His gaze flickered, then he rose and went outside, seeing Yuan Zhu standing there.</p><p>Yuan Zhu showed no external wounds, but it was unclear if the blood fire had been completely suppressed.</p><p>"It seems Daoist Yuan's injuries have healed.  Congratulations."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled warmly.</p><p>Yuan Zhu sighed softly, seeming to have some unspoken concerns. He bowed slightly to Qin Sang. "I haven't yet thanked you for your help, Daoist friend.  I apologize for keeping you waiting. My strength has partially returned, and I can fulfill my promise to escort you out of the storm zone."</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up. He had indeed wanted to leave for some time, as he had much to do.</p><p>"Daoist Yuan, please wait..."</p><p>Qin Sang turned back into the cave.</p><p>Bai was also alerted and came out.</p><p>The two had been in seclusion for two months, not disturbing each other. This was their first meeting.</p><p>"Daoist friend, have you examined the jade slip?  Did you find anything useful?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked expectantly.</p><p>Bai's face showed little joy. He hesitated, "I did recall some fragments, but they were very vague and hard to decipher. They seemed irrelevant to my search for my identity. I'm afraid I'll need to follow you out into the world and witness things firsthand before I can reach a conclusion. By the way..."</p><p>Bai handed the jade slip back to Qin Sang. "I've selected some herbs to try and stabilize my life force and prevent further corruption by the corpse qi. If successful, my cultivation will stabilize, and even if the Heavenly Corpse Talisman remains unbroken, I might have a chance to advance to Corpse King. However, I'm not in a good condition to appear in public. I hope you can help me collect these herbs. Of course, I won't let you help me for nothing. Once I overcome this hurdle, I will repay your kindness."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was overjoyed. If Bai had the chance to become a Corpse King, it would be a great help to him.</p><p>Before the Heavenly Corpse Talisman was removed, Bai couldn't leave his side.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't immediately agree. He scanned the jade slip with his divine sense and found that Bai had listed some herbs, some extremely precious, and some relatively rare, but easily obtained by Qin Sang, though the quantities were considerable.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang nodded.  "So many herbs! Fortunately, I still have some spirit stones; I can buy some first. However, if Daoist friend needs them urgently, we'll need to use the power of the trading house to gather them quickly. I also have something to do. After leaving the storm zone, let's go to the Qiongyu Trading House."</p><p>"The sooner the better..."</p><p>Bai, delighted, thanked him and retreated into his corpse puppet bag.</p><p>Qin Sang put all his belongings into his Qianjun Ring and left the cave.</p><p>Yuan Zhu opened the ancient restriction, and the two passed through the gap, instantly finding themselves in the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed. The storm raged, making it impossible to determine if they were in the same location as when they entered. He suspected that it was highly unlikely, and even if he returned here, he wouldn't find the cave—this was the confidence Yuan Zhu had in bringing him back.</p><p>Yuan Zhu looked around and then flew in a certain direction, and Qin Sang quickly followed.</p><p>Along the way, the two took the opportunity to exchange some words.</p><p>"How far is it from the storm zone to Dongmen Island?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Daoist friend, follow the direction I indicate. Once you're out, you should be north of Dongmen Island, northeast of Tianxing Island…"</p><p>Yuan Zhu asked Qin Sang to take out his map and pointed out the location.</p><p>Then, Yuan Zhu hesitated, took out a scale, and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>This scale was similar to the previous one, only the luster was deeper, and some kind of restriction seemed to be sealed within.</p><p>"What do you mean by this, Daoist friend?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the scale, somewhat surprised.</p><p>"Yuan is abandoned by all, a lone wolf. While we may not be friends, our collaboration to escape the Nine-Phoenix King's clutches has forged a bond.  If you don't mind our different bloodlines, take this scale.  In the future, if you wish to find me, activate the restriction within the scale near my location, and I will appear."</p><p>Yuan Zhu's expression was desolate, his voice filled with sadness.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a moment, then put away the scale. After a moment of reflection, he offered some insights, "Daoist friend, why cling to bloodlines? In my view, the key to breaking your predicament may not lie with the Yaozu, but with human or Wuzu secret techniques."</p><p>"Thank you for the advice!"</p><p>Yuan Zhu's eyes lit up with renewed hope.</p><p>Yuan Zhu's spirits soared, and he continued to talk, asking Qin Sang for a token of remembrance and promising to meet again if fate allows.</p><p>After flying for a long time, they finally reached the edge of the storm zone.</p><p>"Daoist Yuan, until we meet again!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed to Yuan Zhu, then flew out of the barrier. Yuan Zhu watched Qin Sang leave before retreating back into the storm, his figure disappearing.</p><p>Having escaped the storm zone, Qin Sang checked his location on the map.</p><p>"It's good I'm not near Dongmen Island; I wouldn't want to get caught up in another mess," Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>He planned to first visit the Heavenly Dao Sect to see the Ning family sword cultivator; locating the ancient teleportation array was his top priority.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao Sect, the largest righteous sect of humanity, was grand and imposing, but its location was somewhat remote, in the northwest sea area of the Canglang Sea,  avoiding Xing Island entirely.</p><p>Qin Sang found an island called Dayu Island, which housed a moderately sized branch of the Qiongyu Trading Company.</p><p>Having decided on his route, Qin Sang immediately set off on his flying sword.</p><p>Dayu Island was vast, with a cultivator market at its center; it was the core island of the surrounding sea area.</p><p>A streak of sword light approached from afar.  A distance from Dayu Island, the light subsided, revealing a young man—Qin Sang. He glanced at the island, then donned a cloak to suppress his aura, transforming himself into an ordinary cultivator.</p><p>The city was built on a plain in the center of the island. After flying for some time, Qin Sang saw its outline.</p><p>It was already sunset.</p><p>Under the cover of dusk, Qin Sang entered the city and the market.  He inquired about the location of the Qiongyu Trading Company branch and headed straight for it.</p><p>The Qiongyu Trading Company branch was quite impressive, built by the river. It handled various businesses related to cultivators, enjoyed a good reputation, and was quite well-known in the area.</p><p>The shop was bustling with people, the maidservants scurrying about. On the second floor, an elderly man sat in a recliner, leisurely sipping tea and overseeing the shop; only important customers received his personal attention.</p><p>At that moment, a person wearing a black cloak walked in.</p><p>The old man had just taken a sip of spiritual tea when he sensed the profound and deep aura emanating from the cloaked figure. His eyes narrowed sharply, and he immediately put down his teacup and hurried downstairs.</p><p>"Sir..."</p><p>A smiling maidservant approached, about to speak, when she heard the old man's voice, "You may leave. I will personally attend to this esteemed guest."</p><p>"This servant obeys!"</p><p>The maidservant quickly bowed to the newcomer and retreated.  She was inwardly shocked; those who received the master's personal attention were at least at the False Core stage. The cloaked person appeared unremarkable, yet their cultivation was so high.</p><p>"Are you the manager of the Qiongyu Trading Company?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the old man.</p><p>Although this man was a Core Formation cultivator, he carried an air of weariness, suggesting he intended to spend his remaining years here.</p>
