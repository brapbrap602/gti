<h1>Chapter 2078: Jade Sun Divine Milk</h1><p>The Clan Leader's son, recalling how the talisman message had arrived in his hand, still felt a shudder of dread. To be able to act upon him so stealthily, the person behind it was likely a Void Realm Second Stage expert! What did it mean for such a powerhouse to appear within the Chang You Clan's territory and use this method to contact him and his father?  He dared not ponder the implications.</p><p>Seeing his son's unease, the Chang You Clan Leader frowned deeply. "Such panic! What decorum! How can I entrust you with the leadership of the clan in the future?"</p><p>The Clan Leader's son's face was filled with shame.</p><p>The Chang You Clan Leader snorted and strode out of the mansion, his figure fading until he vanished without a trace, disturbing no one.</p><p>Outside the mansion lay the Sacred Lake, its vast expanse of碧波 shimmering. An ancient stone palace flickered in and out of existence on an island at the lake's center, radiating a potent aura. The Chang You Clan's most elite guards stood vigilant, protecting the area.</p><p>The Clan Leader gazed at the ancient palace, seemingly hesitant. After a while, he transformed into a wisp of smoke and sped towards the outer reaches of the sacred grounds, without informing any other clan elders or summoning his guards.</p><p>Beyond the sacred grounds stretched rolling hills and mountains. This too was undoubtedly a cultivation paradise, but no Chang You Clan members had established caves here, lest they disturb the sanctity of the main grounds.</p><p>Pines and cypresses covered the mountains, birdsong filled the air, and flowers bloomed in abundance.</p><p>The Clan Leader traversed the peaks, then abruptly halted, his form reappearing mid-air. His gaze was fixed on the scene ahead.</p><p>Atop a mountain summit stood a figure.</p><p>This person stood with hands clasped behind their back, their form shrouded in a hazy mist, obscuring their features.  It was impossible to determine their tribal origins from their appearance.</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in the Clan Leader's eyes.  He discreetly activated his Spirit Eye technique, but he couldn't penetrate the mist.</p><p>As the figure stood there, it seemed to the Clan Leader as if they were the only thing in existence between heaven and earth, or perhaps they were heaven and earth itself. Just a moment ago, he hadn't noticed this person's presence at all, as if they had appeared out of thin air.</p><p>But the Clan Leader was certain that the figure hadn't suddenly materialized. They had been there all along. He could only perceive them when they willed it.</p><p>Further probing was unnecessary.  The figure's cultivation was self-evident.</p><p>The Clan Leader hadn't brought the clan elders with him because, against a Void Realm Second Stage expert, numbers were meaningless.</p><p>If the figure harbored ill intentions, even the Sacred Lake wouldn't offer sufficient protection.  Yet, the manner in which the message was delivered, without harming him or his son, hinted at a degree of goodwill.</p><p>With a solemn expression, the Clan Leader flew closer and bowed respectfully towards the mysterious figure's back. "This humble Min Zhuo greets the honored senior. May I ask which esteemed personage graces our humble clan with their presence?"</p><p>"You've read the letter."</p><p>The mysterious figure slowly turned.</p><p>Min Zhuo's heart skipped a beat. Within that layer of mist, a pair of deep eyes seemed to gaze upon him, their intent unclear, whether benevolent or malicious.</p><p>The figure hadn't revealed their identity, as Min Zhuo had anticipated.  He nodded slightly.</p><p>"Heh heh..."</p><p>The figure let out an ambiguous chuckle. "You seem to doubt its contents."</p><p>"The letter speaks of an impending calamity upon our clan, yet it doesn't specify the source of this tribulation. Forgive this junior for finding it somewhat alarmist, making it difficult to believe. However, as this matter concerns the prosperity of my entire clan, and as this junior holds the position of Clan Leader, I had to come."</p><p>Min Zhuo raised his head, his tone neither subservient nor arrogant. "Would senior enlighten this junior?"</p><p>The mysterious figure gazed northeastward and spoke indifferently. "What if your enemies now possess a Void Realm Second Stage expert, and not just one?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Min Zhuo's heart jolted.</p><p>The Chang You Clan's current enemies were only those foreign tribes emerging from the Tainted Lands.  Among them were undoubtedly some exceptionally gifted individuals, such as Fairy Liu Li, but it was utterly impossible for her to have broken through to the Void Realm Second Stage so quickly.</p><p>Having himself touched upon the threshold of that realm, he knew one thing for sure: Azure Spirit Qi was practically useless for breaking through to the Void Realm Second Stage.  The Chang You Clan at least possessed a legacy accumulated since ancient times. What did those foreign tribes have?</p><p>For this figure to claim that the foreign tribes possessed multiple Void Realm Second Stage experts was preposterous!</p><p>Before Min Zhuo could voice his objection, the figure continued calmly, "Some time ago, a demon expert arrived via a Shifting Formation. Hmm, according to those foreign tribes, it should be called the Soul Integration stage. This demon's current whereabouts are unknown, but it's highly likely they are heading east. If they were to encounter their kin, do you think those foreign tribes wouldn't pledge allegiance to this demon?"</p><p>Even Min Zhuo, with his composed demeanor, couldn't help but change color upon hearing this.</p><p>Rumors had long circulated that the conflict between the Water Tribe and the Heaven Tribe wasn't confined to the Foreign Tribes themselves. The higher echelons of the Heaven Tribe were deliberately fostering relations with the Eastern Sea demon clans.</p><p>However, the Foreign Tribes inherently weren't welcoming of other races entering the Sea of Mist, and even the demon clans they were allied with rarely ventured within.  The territories of the various Foreign Tribes were separated by Mist Tides, and travel between them required Shifting Formations.  Only powerful demons could penetrate deep into the heart of the Sea of Mist.</p><p>These powerful beings were elusive, rarely encountered by smaller clans, which was why the Chang You Clan wasn't overly concerned about the Storm Realm contacting the Eastern Sea demon clans.  However, they weren't entirely without precautions.  They had been consistently hunting down scouts sent by the Storm Realm, effectively confining them.</p><p>But if a powerful demon took the initiative to come, the Chang You Clan had no defense.</p><p>"They are, after all, outsiders.  Perhaps they harbor reservations and haven't acted rashly yet.  But once they decide to strike against you, heh heh..."</p><p>The mysterious figure chuckled. "Due to an ancient pact, Zhu Yan won't stand idly by and watch the Chang You Clan be annihilated, but that's all. Do you believe you and your clan elders can escape unscathed? The conflict arose because of you, and the consequences, even the destruction of your entire clan, will be yours to bear. That's the rule. The result will be your complete annihilation, the Chang You Clan reduced to slaves."</p><p>The figure's tone was detached, devoid of any attempt at manipulation, simply stating a fact.</p><p>A fact that filled Min Zhuo with dread.</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression shifted rapidly. This news was terrifying. If true, the Chang You Clan teetered on the brink of destruction.</p><p>But why was this person warning him? Was it purely out of kindness?</p><p>Who exactly was this person?!</p><p>"Senior..." Min Zhuo opened his mouth, then suddenly saw the mysterious figure raise their right hand. A white light flickered in their palm, revealing a jade bottle.</p><p>Inside the bottle was a drop of milky-white spiritual milk, radiating a gentle white light.  Every three breaths, a flash of profound yellow light would pulse through it, appearing exceptionally dense, as if weighing a thousand tons.</p><p>Min Zhuo was initially taken aback, finding this spiritual milk somewhat familiar.  Then, recalling a certain item, he exclaimed, "Jade Sun Divine Milk!"</p><p>Jade Sun Divine Milk was one of the spiritual medicines produced within the Sea of Mist. It was said that its source was controlled by a certain higher clan, making it extremely rare.  Even rarer was the amount that trickled out into the world.  Smaller clans like his couldn't even dream of obtaining it.</p><p>Min Zhuo needed external aid to break through to the Void Realm Second Stage, and he had considered Jade Sun Divine Milk, but quickly dismissed the thought.  He would be content with acquiring other spiritual medicines, even if their properties were inferior.</p><p>The preciousness of Jade Sun Divine Milk lay not only in its ability to assist in breakthroughs but also in its ability to solidify one's foundation.  He also noticed that the Jade Sun Divine Milk in the bottle had been refined, a process requiring the direct intervention of a Void Realm Second Stage expert, undoubtedly enhancing its potency even further.</p><p>It could be said that if he consumed this drop of Jade Sun Divine Milk, he could soon begin assaulting the bottleneck, and his chances of success would greatly increase.</p><p>A flicker of greed flashed in Min Zhuo's eyes.  The allure of the treasure was immense, but he didn't lose his head.</p><p>He took a deep breath to compose himself.  "What is senior's intention?"</p><p>"Consume the Divine Milk, break through to the Void Realm Second Stage, and perhaps you can weather this calamity."</p><p>The jade bottle floated up from the figure's palm and drifted between them.</p><p>Faced with the readily available Divine Milk, Min Zhuo's eyes burned hotter, but he remained lucid.</p><p>"They have two Void Realm Second Stage experts. Even if this junior were to break through, how could I possibly be their match?"</p><p>The mysterious figure spoke with profound meaning, "When the time comes, someone will come to your aid."</p><p>A glint flashed in Min Zhuo's eyes. He suddenly felt a sense of suffocation, as if he had fallen into a grand conspiracy.</p><p>He had a premonition earlier that such a great boon wouldn't come without a price.  The other party wanted him, and the Chang You Clan, to become their pawns!</p><p>Min Zhuo remained silent.  Even if he understood, what could he do? Could he refuse the temptation of Jade Sun Divine Milk?</p><p>"If this junior accepts the Jade Sun Divine Milk..." Min Zhuo's voice was dry. "What does senior require of this junior?"</p><p>"Blood feuds between clans must be avenged.  Do what you must," the figure stated indifferently.</p><p>They took a step towards the edge of the mountain and vanished instantly, leaving behind only one sentence:</p><p>"The Divine Milk will remain here. You may retrieve it at any time."</p><p>The mountaintop was empty.</p><p>Min Zhuo stared at the Jade Sun Divine Milk, struggling internally.</p><p>Ultimately, he didn't reach for it.  He turned and flew back towards the Sacred Lake, leaving the Divine Milk behind.</p><p>It was evident that the mysterious figure had placed a restriction on the Jade Sun Divine Milk.  Only he could see it within the entire Chang You Clan, so there was no fear of it being taken by others.</p><p>If a Void Realm Second Stage expert were to pass by and seize the Jade Sun Divine Milk, it might not be a bad thing.</p><p>He needed to think carefully.</p><p>The Clan Leader's son was still waiting outside the meditation chamber. Seeing his father return safely, he relaxed and hurried to greet him, "Father..."</p><p>Unexpectedly, his father ignored him, entering the chamber and immediately sealing it with a formation barrier.</p><p>The Clan Leader's son was shut out, his heart filled with increasing anxiety.</p><p>Inside the chamber, Min Zhuo sat cross-legged, the fragrant smoke entering his orifices, calming his mind.</p><p>He carefully recalled every word and action of the mysterious figure, and the implications behind those words.</p><p>Was the arrival of the Great Demon at this time a coincidence, or was there another motive?</p><p>What was the identity of the mysterious figure? Why were they targeting the Great Demon, manipulating him to confront it? What was their ultimate goal?</p><p>And how much did these people actually know...</p><p>Time flowed silently, the lamp oil seemingly inexhaustible.  After an unknown period, a ripple of emotion finally surfaced on Min Zhuo's face, as if awakening from a dream.</p><p>His eyes slowly moved, gazing eastward, a profound depth in their gaze.  After a long while, his lips moved slightly, uttering words barely audible, like a whisper in the wind.</p><p>"Dai Yu Immortal Mountain..."</p><p>...</p><p>Deer Wild.</p><p>Now, Deer Wild had been completely reorganized. Most of the palaces and pavilions had been relocated to the lower slopes, returning the bamboo forest to its tranquil serenity.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple disciples had also been driven out of Deer Wild, each seeking out spiritual mountains and beautiful peaks to establish temporary cave dwellings.</p><p>Currently, the Green Goat Temple had no defenses against the outside world. At least until the first layer of the protective mountain formation took initial shape, they would remain vulnerable. Everyone in the temple was busy.</p><p>Li Yufu and Shen Chen were currently in a meditation chamber within Deer Wild, collaborating to refine formation artifacts.</p><p>Shen Chen's ascension to the position of Alliance Leader of the Heavenly Crafts Alliance spoke volumes about his mastery of artifact refinement. However, some formation artifacts were too complex and still required Li Yufu's assistance.</p><p>They sat facing each other, a sphere of water floating between them, radiating a faint blue light.</p><p>Inside the water sphere was a spiritual banner, its surface plain white, completely blank.</p><p>With a serious expression, Shen Chen directed streams of hand seals towards the water sphere.  Li Yufu only needed to observe Shen Chen and mimic his movements, his task much easier.</p><p>After absorbing hundreds of hand seals, the water sphere finally stirred. Ripples appeared on its surface, and thin streams of water emerged within, swirling rapidly around the spiritual banner.</p><p>Suddenly, one stream of water, like a whip, lashed out at the banner. The banner's surface trembled, then absorbed the water stream, a blue mark appearing on its surface.</p><p>As this phenomenon repeated itself, more and more marks appeared, forming an incredibly complex pattern, finally erupting in a dazzling blue light.</p><p>When the blue light dissipated, the banner fell into Shen Chen's hand. Its surface had turned pale blue, soft as water, surpassing the finest silk in the world.</p><p>"Finally, one is complete. Many thanks for your assistance, Senior Brother!"  Shen Chen took a deep breath. He had wasted quite a few spiritual materials these past days, and the pressure was mounting.</p><p>Li Yufu, seeing this, offered words of encouragement. "Junior Brother, there's no need to rush.  With your skill, as long as you immerse yourself in comprehension and proceed step by step, you will surely refine them all."</p><p>Shen Chen shook his head. He considered this a test from his master and was determined to show his best.</p><p>Putting away the banner, Shen Chen laid out another set of spiritual materials and began to comprehend the next type of formation banner.</p><p>Just then, Li Yufu's expression shifted slightly as he looked outwards. "We have distinguished guests arriving.  I shall return later."</p><p>He flew out of Deer Wild and saw a crane carriage approaching from the horizon.  The crane's feathers were pristine white, its appearance noble and extraordinary.  Seated within the carriage was a wizened Daoist priest, gazing down at the land below.</p><p>Li Yufu flew forward.</p><p>The Daoist priest also noticed him and stopped the crane carriage.</p><p>"Greetings, True Monarch."</p><p>Li Yufu bowed deeply.</p><p>The newcomer was True Monarch He Gao, the current master of the Eight Sceneries Sect, a person of high status and profound cultivation.</p><p>Currently, the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, the Eight Sceneries Sect, and the Heaven's Vast Tower formed the Tri-Sect Alliance, which remained the dominant power in the Central Continent.</p><p>Li Yufu knew that the other party must have learned about the Green Goat Temple establishing a mountain gate here and had come to investigate.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple had made no attempt at concealment.  Huan Hen had been recalled from the front lines, Shen Chen had taken leave from the Heavenly Crafts Alliance, and the remaining Green Goat Temple disciples, aside from those with garrison duties, had essentially all been summoned here.</p><p>Only Yu Nu remained in the North Sea.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple's re-establishment had spread throughout the Storm Realm, and several groups of cultivators had already visited during this period.</p><p>True Monarch He Gao rose and returned the bow, his tone tinged with admiration. "Sect Master Li, I hadn't expected your esteemed temple to create such a magnificent scene in such a short time.  I imagine it won't be long before this place transforms into a blessed immortal land.  I perceive that even before completion, your protective mountain formation is remarkably intricate. Is it perhaps the work of Fairy Liu Li?"</p><p>Everyone knew that the Green Goat Temple would inevitably re-establish its mountain gate; the small Deer Wild couldn't contain them.  Now that the battlefield had reached a temporary stalemate, and the Chang You Clan's advantage was dwindling, it was only natural for the Green Goat Temple to make its move.</p><p>However, the Green Goat Temple establishing its mountain gate near the Central Continent couldn't be ignored.</p>
