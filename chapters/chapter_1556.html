<h1></h1><p>Having advanced to the Fourth Transformation, equivalent to the Nascent Soul realm, Fei Can seemed to have not grasped any new divine abilities, only possessing the ability to ward off poisons.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought that it would at least be able to wield poison against enemies, gaining a certain degree of combat prowess.</p><p>Even something like the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Heavenly Eye Divine Light could play a crucial role in battles.</p><p>Yet Fei Can could only be useful in special environments like the Three Poison Lands of the Seven Kills Palace or when encountering poisonous opponents like the Frogfish.</p><p>How could such a spirit insect survive alone in the perilous world of cultivation?</p><p>Coerced by Qin Sang, Fei Can spat out several clusters of seven-colored halos, its tongue lolling out from exhaustion, its gaze vacant. It could only further reinforce its poison-repelling carapace.</p><p>Qin Sang gave up helplessly and turned to check on Ya Gu's condition.</p><p>With just one glance, Qin Sang had a feeling that Ya Gu was different.</p><p>But this change wasn't outwardly apparent.</p><p>She was the same as before, cheeks rosy, eyelids closed, breathing steady, still a sleeping beauty.</p><p>The change came from her divine soul.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly perceive that Ya Gu's divine soul had become more stable.</p><p>It was clearly related to Fei Can. Fei Can's advancement had made the 'anchor' more robust.  Even facing the violent winds and waves in the darkness, Ya Gu could still tightly grasp the rope connecting her to the light.</p><p>Perhaps, there were other reasons unknown to Qin Sang.</p><p>The connection between Ya Gu and Fei Can was much closer than he had imagined.</p><p>Although Ya Gu still couldn't respond, her condition had significantly improved.  If not for the incident at the Seven Kills Palace, she would certainly be in an even better state, perhaps even already awake.</p><p>He could finally see hope.</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed Fei Can's head. If Ya Gu could be awakened, even if Fei Can didn't possess any divine abilities, it wouldn't have been a waste to raise it.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Finally free, Fei Can eagerly burrowed into Ya Gu's brow and fell fast asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang remained where he was, not hurrying to leave.</p><p>He hadn't ventured too far from the tribulation site, intending to see if any cultivators would be alerted by the heavenly tribulation and come to investigate.</p><p>Fei Can's tribulation was an unexpected event, too hasty to avoid attracting attention.</p><p>A Fourth Transformation spirit insect was absolutely rare in the cultivation world.  Once the news spread, it was very likely to attract Nascent Soul cultivators to capture it, or even draw the attention of major Immortal Sects.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected,</p><p>After a while, two streaks of light flew from afar. They were two male cultivators, one old and one young, appearing like grandfather and grandson, but both possessing considerable cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, the young man's cultivation was higher, unexpectedly at the mid-Gold Core stage, while the elder was only slightly weaker.</p><p>"Two Gold Core cultivators are attracted so easily. It seems the Immortal Sects in Fudù Commandery are quite powerful..."</p><p>Qin Sang observed their movements, thinking to himself.</p><p>The two headed straight for the tribulation site.</p><p>Although the tribulation clouds had dispersed, the Heavenly Might carried by the tribulation lightning hadn't completely vanished, and Qin Sang couldn't completely erase this Heavenly Might either.</p><p>The two were quite experienced. Before getting close, they sensed this Heavenly Might and immediately recognized it.</p><p>"Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>The two exclaimed in unison, exchanging a look of astonishment.</p><p>They had been busy with another matter and hadn't witnessed the tribulation lightning firsthand. They had only sensed the unusual fluctuations of spiritual energy from afar and decided to investigate on a whim. They never expected someone to be undergoing a tribulation here.</p><p>It was common knowledge that only Nascent Soul cultivators were qualified to trigger heavenly tribulations.</p><p>For a moment, they both felt a chill down their spines, regretting their recklessness, and subconsciously wanted to turn and flee.</p><p>However, they had already seen the scene of the tribulation site.</p><p>Everywhere was scorched black. The mountaintop was almost flattened by the tribulation lightning. The entire mountain was a mess, partly due to the tribulation lightning and partly due to Qin Sang's handiwork.</p><p>The destruction caused by the heavenly tribulation was evident, but the figure of the person undergoing the tribulation was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Combined with the fact that the thunder had not lasted long,</p><p>Could it be that the mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator had failed the tribulation?</p><p>They exchanged a glance, unable to resist the immense temptation.  Boldly approaching, they searched carefully but failed to find any Nascent Soul relics, feeling greatly disappointed.</p><p>"Let's quickly return and report to Senior Martial Brother Sect Master.  I wonder which Nascent Soul senior was passing through and actually underwent a tribulation here.  Let the sect seniors report it to the Six Void Sect. Perhaps they can find some clues," the young cultivator said.</p><p>The elder stroked his goatee, agreeing, "That's the right thing to do.  No matter what the senior's background is, it has nothing to do with us.  It's a pity that under the heavenly tribulation, not even a single shard remains!"</p><p>"That senior may not have truly failed the tribulation. Have either of us seen a true heavenly tribulation?"</p><p>The young cultivator shook his head, sealing the area around the mountain peak with a formation, called out to the elder, and flew away on his flying light.</p><p>Qin Sang was standing not far from them.</p><p>The two were completely unaware that their conversation had fallen into someone else's ears.</p><p>Confirming that these two hadn't seen the silver tribulation lightning with their own eyes and had indeed been misled into believing it was a cultivator's tribulation, Qin Sang didn't intend to do anything to them and let them leave.</p><p>News of a Nascent Soul tribulation would stir up the situation in Fudù Commandery, but it wouldn't get out of control. It might not be a bad thing.</p><p>"Six Void Sect..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured the three words, his figure flickering and disappearing.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang returned to Fudù Commandery and chose an elegant dwelling in the Six Continents Hall, waiting for Zhou Jin's arrival.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Zhou Jin arrived as promised.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Zhou Jin was overjoyed and bowed deeply, "Greetings, Senior Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I didn't expect to be gone for nearly ten years.  Have you been staying in Fudù Commandery all these years? Have you found anything?"</p><p>Zhou Jin was worried about Ruan Yu's illness.  For nearly ten years without news from Qin Sang, he feared that the senior had met with an accident or had forgotten the matter, living in constant anxiety, yet not daring to slack off.</p><p>Fortunately, the worst-case scenario hadn't happened.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, Zhou Jin spoke quickly, "This junior followed Senior's instructions. After leaving Zé Commandery that year, I rushed to this area to investigate news of Pú Mountain and the Xie family..."</p><p>Pú Mountain, Xie family.</p><p>Related to the superior cultivation ground recorded by Xiao Xiang Zi.</p><p>The cultivation ground was named the Clear Void Illusionary Realm and was located on Pú Mountain.</p><p>The Xie family once had two Nascent Soul ancestors and held a prominent position even in the cultivator-rich Middle Continent.  The Clear Void Illusionary Realm was extremely secluded and had always been controlled by the Xie family, unknown to outsiders.</p><p>The Clear Void Illusionary Realm not only served as a cave dwelling but also held other secrets.</p><p>Generations of Xie family descendants had painstakingly researched it but had never been able to unlock the secret, until one of the Xie family's Nascent Soul ancestors met Xiao Xiang Zi.  Seeing his unique divine abilities, he invited him into the Clear Void Illusionary Realm, finally unraveling the secret.</p><p>What benefits the three obtained within the Clear Void Illusionary Realm wasn't detailed in the jade slip.</p><p>Sadly, just as they were about to divide the treasures after unlocking the secret, the Xie family ancestor was blinded by greed and attempted to kill Xiao Xiang Zi to claim all the treasures for himself.</p><p>Xiao Xiang Zi clearly hadn't reached the Spirit Severing stage at that time, otherwise, the Xie family ancestor wouldn't have been so foolish.</p><p>Even so, both Xie family Nascent Soul ancestors were ultimately slain by Xiao Xiang Zi in retaliation.</p><p>Xiao Xiang Zi didn't exterminate the entire Xie family. However, in his fury, he wasn't willing to let them off so easily. He personally sealed the Clear Void Illusionary Realm, preventing future Xie family descendants from entering.</p><p>Cooperation and betrayal occurred every moment in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>Nor did Xiao Xiang Zi find anything wrong with his actions.</p><p>This betrayal ignited Xiao Xiang Zi's killing intent, almost leading him to slaughter the entire Xie family.  He was on the verge of succumbing to his inner demons. It was this incident that jolted him awake, making him aware of the influence of his inner demons.  The fact that he later traveled extensively, refining Soul Calming Incense, and promptly addressed the hidden danger allowed him the opportunity to advance to the Spirit Severing stage.</p><p>But when he later reflected on his past cultivation journey, he realized that the other Xie family Nascent Soul ancestor initially hadn't intended to betray him and had been coerced by the Xie family ancestor, forced into action.</p><p>Since the other party chose to attack him, regardless of their true intentions, Xiao Xiang Zi couldn't hold back.</p><p>However, the rage stemming from the betrayal had subsided considerably.</p><p>Xiao Xiang Zi recorded this incident, requesting that whoever obtained the jade slip travel to Middle Continent and locate the Xie family.  If the restriction on the Clear Void Illusionary Realm still existed, they were to open it and return it to the Xie family, settling this karmic debt.</p><p>Qin Sang dispatched Zhou Jin to search for the Xie family.</p><p>Firstly, to fulfill Xiao Xiang Zi's entrustment, and secondly, he could also cultivate in the Clear Void Illusionary Realm.</p><p>Time had passed, place names had changed, and powers had shifted. Just like the destroyed cave dwelling in the Sky Rift Valley and the renamed Zhúlán Temple, even if the Xie family no longer existed and the Clear Void Illusionary Realm had a new owner, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>"After arriving here, this junior traveled throughout Fudù Commandery and the surrounding three commanderies but couldn't find Pú Mountain. Later, I learned that after Zhuō Commandery was incorporated into the Nineteen Commanderies of Misty Rain, Mount Bùniàn had spearheaded a large-scale geomantic survey, dividing Zhuō Commandery into various commanderies and changing many place names. This junior then sought to collect ancient texts..."</p><p>Zhou Jin's tone was light, clearly indicating a discovery. "Three years ago, this junior finally saw the two characters 'Pú Mountain' in an ancient text. After much verification, I confirmed that Pú Mountain is indeed within Fudù Commandery, and it is the current Luóyān Mountain! However, the owner of Luóyān Mountain is no longer the Xie family, but the Luóyān Sect."</p><p>"Luóyān Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. "Do the cultivators of this sect wear jade pendants engraved with the character 'Luó' at their waists?"</p><p>The two people attracted by Fei Can's heavenly tribulation had such jade pendants.</p><p>Pú Mountain had indeed changed hands, but it was unknown whether the Luóyān Sect had discovered the Clear Void Illusionary Realm.</p><p>"Has Senior met disciples of the Luóyān Sect?"</p><p>Zhou Jin nodded. "The Luóyān Sect has many experts. This junior didn't dare to act openly and could only secretly investigate the relationship between the Luóyān Sect and the Xie family. Later, I discovered that Luóyān Mountain was forcibly seized from the Xie family by the Luóyān Sect, and the Xie family was forced to relocate from Pú Mountain.  The family has already declined."</p><p>With the fall of their two Nascent Soul ancestors and the loss of the Clear Void Illusionary Realm, the Xie family had lost its foundation for prosperity, its peak followed by decline.</p><p>It was extremely difficult for them to survive to this day, their bloodline unbroken, and they owed it to the stability of the Middle Continent.</p><p>Upon learning the whereabouts of the Xie family, Zhou Jin immediately sought them out.</p><p>Now, the Xie family had become an ordinary cultivation family, their current patriarch only at the Foundation Establishment stage.  Their ancestral land, Pú Mountain, had been occupied, and its name changed, yet they dared not utter a single word of complaint.</p><p>"This junior deliberately approached the Xie family and learned one thing," Zhou Jin paused. "Back then, when the Xie family yielded Pú Mountain, they made a deal with the Luóyān Sect. Now, it has long passed the agreed-upon time, and the Luóyān Sect shows no intention of returning it.  If Senior wishes to help the Xie family reclaim Pú Mountain, you can start from here."</p><p>Zhou Jin now mistakenly believed that Qin Sang was a descendant of the Xie family who had returned to their ancestral land to seek justice for their family.</p><p>"Is the Luóyān Sect very powerful?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>Judging by Zhou Jin's tone, it seemed he couldn't force the Luóyān Sect to comply and return Pú Mountain to the Xie family through sheer cultivation strength.</p><p>Zhou Jin respectfully said, "The Luóyān Sect's sect master is only at the late Gold Core stage.  Senior can easily eliminate him.  However, there's one more thing to be wary of.  Behind the Luóyān Sect is the Six Void Sect.  The transaction between the Luóyān Sect and the Xie family was witnessed by someone sent by the Six Void Sect. This junior has been investigating their connection and discovered that the Luóyān Sect's sect master has a close relationship with the Six Void Sect. The Six Void Sect has three Nascent Soul elders and is a powerful force, the hegemon of the surrounding commanderies. Even Mount Bùniàn can't interfere, and the Governor of Fudù Commandery can't control matters outside the commandery city."</p><p>Zhou Jin had been diligent, even investigating the difficulties Qin Sang would face.</p><p>"Well done."</p><p>Qin Sang was quite satisfied with Zhou Jin. Praising him and keeping his promise, he took out the jade slip containing the medicinal formula and a jade box.</p><p>Overjoyed, Zhou Jin hurriedly reached out with both hands to receive them. Opening the jade box, he saw a spirit herb inside and looked up in astonishment.</p><p>"This Dark Essence Grass is the main ingredient of the formula.  I discovered it by chance in the Western Desert.  This herb is precious. If you were to search for it yourself, it would take at least ten years, potentially delaying the treatment."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, looking at Zhou Jin. "I am currently short-handed. If you are willing, you can bring Ruan Yu along to Pú Mountain for cultivation when you return."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Zhou Jin knelt and kowtowed, expressing his heartfelt gratitude.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired about the details from Zhou Jin, pondering his subsequent plans.</p><p>If it were only the Luóyān Sect, he could simply go to their doorstep and drive them down the mountain, minimizing the impact.  Now, with the involvement of the Six Void Sect, careful planning was required.</p><p>Of the three Nascent Soul cultivators in the Six Void Sect, only one was at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Taking his avatar along and storming in would be satisfying, but he had to consider the subsequent repercussions.</p><p>In Middle Continent, regardless of one's cultivation level, one couldn't act recklessly.</p><p>Moreover, it was still unclear whether the Clear Void Illusionary Realm had been exposed. If it involved a dispute over the cultivation ground, things would become even more troublesome.</p><p>After some deliberation,</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Zhou Jin to take him to the Xie family first.</p><p>…</p><p>Driven off Pú Mountain by the Luóyān Sect, the Xie family wasn't strong enough to seize a good spiritual vein and could only settle for a low-grade one.</p><p>This further accelerated the Xie family's decline, and their accumulated resources were almost depleted.  Now, even their esteemed patriarch hadn't broken through to the Gold Core stage and was stuck at the False Core realm.</p><p>However, thanks to their previous foundation, the Xie family's protective formation was still quite powerful.</p><p>"Patriarch Xie, an old friend is visiting."</p><p>Arriving in front of the Xie family's fortress, Zhou Jin channeled his true essence and called out.</p><p>The voice reached the Xie family.</p><p>Soon, the mist parted to the sides, and a figure emerged. It was Xie An, the head of the Xie family. He had a rather distinguished air.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhou, what a rare guest," Xie An strode forward with great enthusiasm.  Seeing Qin Sang beside Zhou Jin, he couldn't sense his cultivation level and felt a jolt in his heart.  "This Fellow Daoist is?"</p><p>Zhou Jin coughed and said, "This is Senior Qin."</p><p>"Senior!"</p><p>Xie An was stunned.</p><p>Zhou Jin was a Gold Core cultivator. Could the senior he spoke of be…</p>
