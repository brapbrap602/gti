<h1>Chapter 492: Confrontation of Treasures</h1><p>Even the dense Peach Blossom Poison became chaotic under the onslaught of the Flying Night Rakshasa's surging corpse energy and the Crow Robe Daoist's roiling demonic energy.  </p><p>If someone were to stand above the valley at this moment, they would see black tendrils emerging from the pink Peach Blossom Poison within the valley, becoming increasingly prominent.</p><p>The Crow Robe Daoist's power, while not that of a true Golden Core cultivator, was still formidable. The Flying Night Rakshasa's speed and physical strength were no longer advantages against him.  </p><p>Previously, the Flying Night Rakshasa could rely on its elusive abilities to keep the Black Dragon on the defensive. This tactic was ineffective against the Crow Robe Daoist. Qin Sang's goal was not merely to defeat the Crow Robe Daoist; he had to order the Flying Night Rakshasa to engage the Crow Robe Daoist in direct confrontation, leaving him no room to breathe.</p><p>The stone house no longer existed, reduced to rubble.</p><p>This space was filled with corpse energy and demonic energy, chilling to the bone.</p><p>The Crow Robe Daoist attempted several times to manipulate the outer spirit formation, but Qin Sang easily saw through his attempts and countered them swiftly. This once-powerful spirit formation had become useless.</p><p>Uncontrolled, the spirit formation was severely affected and struggled to maintain itself.</p><p>Under the onslaught of these chaotic forces, the ruins of the stone house were annihilated, leaving a large hole in the ground. The peach orchard outside was devastated in swathes.</p><p>The valley was crisscrossed with ravines, littered with broken branches and petals.</p><p>Unable to leave the battlefield, Qin Sang found himself adrift in the corpse and demonic energy, feeling incredibly vulnerable, his senses impaired. Fortunately, he could still perceive the Crow Robe Daoist's movements through the Flying Night Rakshasa,</p><p>preventing him from being caught off guard.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A violent gale swept across the battlefield.</p><p>The Crow Robe Daoist roared repeatedly.</p><p>From the surging demonic energy, a whirlwind suddenly appeared, like a black dragon, piercing through the corpse energy with astonishing speed and slamming into the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>The whirlwind's power was terrifying.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa vanished instantly, narrowly avoiding the attack, but its offensive momentum faltered.</p><p>Just as the Flying Night Rakshasa regained its footing and prepared to attack again, an exceptionally powerful aura erupted from the depths of the demonic energy.  Immediately afterward, an aura even darker and more profound than the demonic energy spread out, forming a black storm of demonic energy that threatened to engulf the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity. Upon closer inspection, he realized that the darkness within this demonic energy was actually a black flame, concealed by the demonic storm!</p><p>The uninformed would surely suffer greatly.</p><p>Nine Nether Demon Fire!</p><p>Ten Directions Yama Banner!</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, unsurprised.</p><p>Of the five Ten Directions Yama Banners of the Kuiyin Sect, the Crow Robe Daoist possessed one. His banner had been damaged during the Yuanzhao Gate incident when the Yuanzhao Gate sect master self-destructed.</p><p>But years had passed since then, and the Crow Robe Daoist had returned to the Kuiyin Sect at some point, he wasn't destitute.</p><p>He might not have fully recovered from his injuries, but repairing a magical treasure should have been within his capabilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated the Crow Robe Daoist possessing a magical treasure.</p><p>He knew the terrifying nature of the Nine Nether Demon Fire. This demonic fire was extraordinarily effective against souls, making it the Flying Night Rakshasa's nemesis. To kill the Crow Robe Daoist, he had to first disable the Ten Directions Yama Banner!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa to avoid the brunt of the attack and engage in a guerilla fight with the Crow Robe Daoist. At the same time, he focused his mind on his primordial spirit space, silently activating the Ebony Sword.</p><p>A flash from his brow, the Ebony Sword silently flew out, its brilliance subdued, pointed towards the depths of the demonic energy.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's mind was incredibly tense. His attention wasn't solely focused on the Ten Directions Yama Banner; he constantly observed his surroundings.</p><p>Yu Hua had said that the Crow Robe Daoist only possessed two magical treasures, and his natal treasure had been completely destroyed when the Yuanzhao Gate sect master self-destructed.</p><p>Logically, the Crow Robe Daoist, like a hunted dog, with lingering injuries, and constantly hiding, should not have had the energy to refine a new natal treasure; he should only have the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>In fact, the Crow Robe Daoist hadn't used any other magical treasure.</p><p>But unforeseen circumstances could always occur. Cultivators of this level were extremely cunning; the tactic of creating a diversion while secretly achieving another goal was all too familiar, and he himself often employed it.</p><p>He could not afford to let his guard down; otherwise, it would mean utter ruin.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully searched but found no trace of other magical treasures, yet he noticed the situation on the battlefield shifting.</p><p>The Crow Robe Daoist, wielding the Ten Directions Yama Banner, was displaying incredible power. He controlled the banner with far greater ease than Qin Sang or Yu Hua, unleashing the demonic fire with abandon.</p><p>Waves of demonic fire surged forth, forcing the Flying Night Rakshasa to repeatedly dodge.</p><p>Confronted by the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the Flying Night Rakshasa was hampered, its offense severely disrupted.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa to engage the opponent fully, secretly activating the ebony sword.  He concealed the sword's form, quietly approaching the Crow-Robe Daoist.</p><p>This was his only chance; he absolutely could not fail!</p><p>Unfortunately, the pervasive demonic energy was like an extension of the Crow-Robe Daoist's will.  The ebony sword's concealment technique struggled within the demonic aura.  It failed to remain hidden for long and, before it could approach the Crow-Robe Daoist, its presence was detected.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>The Crow-Robe Daoist roared in fury, flinging his banner. A jet of demonic fire shot out, directly towards the ebony sword.</p><p>An ordinary magical weapon would have been destroyed instantly by the Nine Netherworld Inferno.  However, the ebony sword was also a magical treasure, impervious to the Nine Netherworld Inferno. Seeing this, Qin Sang made a daring decision. He controlled the ebony sword, neither dodging nor weaving, but instead, flying directly towards the demonic fire!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Crow-Robe Daoist's expression froze.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Inferno was forcibly pierced by the ebony sword, which emerged unscathed.  After a slight pause, it continued its trajectory towards the Daoist.</p><p>"A magical treasure?"</p><p>The Crow-Robe Daoist's eyes widened in shock. But his sharp gaze quickly discerned the truth: Qin Sang's cultivation was insufficient to fully utilize the treasure's power; he relied mainly on the inherent properties of the weapon to withstand the demonic fire.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s hands, the treasure was being wasted.</p><p>The Crow-Robe Daoist calmed down, letting out a cruel laugh.  "Leave that treasure for me!"</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>Several more blasts of the Nine Netherworld Inferno erupted, forcing back the Flying Night Rakshasa, while the Crow-Robe Daoist personally unleashed the Ten Directions Yama Banner, counterattacking Qin Sang.</p><p>Now!</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for this moment. His eyes narrowed, and he silently chanted, "Sword Qi Thunder Sound!"</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A blinding flash of lightning, like divine retribution, easily tore through the dense demonic energy.</p><p>"Sword Qi Thunder Sound!"</p><p>Under the Crow-Robe Daoist's astonished gaze, the ebony sword instantly closed the distance, striking before him. The sword, radiating a razor-sharp aura, aimed for his vital point.</p><p>The Crow-Robe Daoist hurriedly used the Ten Directions Yama Banner to block.</p><p>The enormous ghostly banner billowed, its demonic flames erupting, engulfing the entire flag in fire. The sudden power unleashed shocked even Qin Sang.</p><p>The ebony sword hurtled forward.</p><p>As the two magical treasures were about to collide…</p><p>The ebony sword suddenly became covered in a crimson glow, spreading across its surface at an astonishing speed until it transformed into a blood-red blade!</p>
