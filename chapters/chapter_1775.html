<h1>Chapter 1766: Refining Emptiness</h1><p>The most magnificent mansion in the Demon City was the Marquis’s Manor.</p><p>A chilling atmosphere pervaded the manor.</p><p>Following the Marquis’s orders, the generals under him were methodically deploying demon soldiers, dispatching unit after unit.</p><p>At this moment, while all of the Marquis’s forces were mobilized, the Marquis’s Manor was at its most vulnerable.</p><p>Just then, above the forbidden area of the manor, a black stone hall, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p>By the time the demon guards discovered the person, a breathtaking sword light descended from the heavens.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword light cascaded down, striking the stone hall directly.</p><p>The protective barrier of the stone hall shattered instantly.  The demon guards watched helplessly as the sword light sliced through the protective barrier and plunged into the hall.</p><p>A sword mark appeared in the center of the stone hall, cleaving it in two. The ensuing shockwave caused the hall to collapse, sending debris flying.</p><p>The sword was too fast, too sharp; the demon guards couldn't react in time to stop it.</p><p>All the demon guards were stunned.</p><p>This stone hall was not only the forbidden area of the manor, but also its treasury, where all the treasures of the Marquis's territory were stored.</p><p>Even the Eagle Commander dared not trespass without the Marquis’s permission, yet it had been split open with a single sword strike!</p><p>Dust and smoke rose from the ruins. The person who had unleashed that sword was gone, having obviously already entered the treasury.</p><p>Imagining the terrifying consequences of the treasury being looted, the demon guards were seized by terror. Their eyes reddened, they charged towards the stone hall, roaring furiously.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Several of the fastest demon guards had just reached the ruins.</p><p>Suddenly, a white light flashed, and another sword light, like a lightning bolt, tore through the smoke and dust, narrowly missing the demon guards.</p><p>These demon guards instantly froze, collapsing to the ground, their bodies shattering into pieces—killed instantly.</p><p>No one could see how the sword light had slain these demon guards.  The remaining guards faltered.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The Marquis’s Manor trembled violently.  The sword light burst out of the manor, transforming into a dazzling rainbow, and vanished into the distance.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was moving south according to his plan.</p><p>Racing along, Qin Sang encountered more and more demon soldiers, secretly marveling at the Marquis’s formidable military strength.</p><p>This was just one demon marquis's territory. No wonder the Gui Fang Kingdom could hold its own against the Celestial Court for so long.</p><p>He didn't encounter any particularly difficult opponents along the way.  The demon soldiers all seemed to be heading northwest.</p><p>Based on this, he deduced that he was moving away from the chaos and should be safe.</p><p>Qin Sang gradually relaxed, secretly wondering what major event had transpired in the Gui Fang Kingdom. Unfortunately, he had too little information to draw any conclusions, so he stopped racking his brains over it.</p><p>Gradually, the number of demon soldiers Qin Sang encountered thinned out.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang thought he was safe, the Sky Eye Butterfly suddenly gave a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He instantly appeared on the nearest peak and looked towards the horizon.</p><p>He saw brilliant clouds filling the eastern sky, a breathtaking sight.</p><p>Within the clouds, a white rainbow was splitting the sky.</p><p>This was clearly a cultivator's escape technique. The speed was astonishing, faster than a shooting star. Before the light even arrived, Qin Sang sensed the overwhelming power emanating from it.</p><p>“A Nascent Soul cultivator!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>He didn't sense any overwhelming demonic energy from the person, suggesting it was likely a human cultivator.</p><p>Furthermore, the person was heading straight for his location.</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He immediately connected the dots.</p><p>Was this person the one who had wreaked havoc in the Marquis’s territory?</p><p>This person had escaped from countless pursuing demon soldiers.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of his deliberate detour south to avoid the storm, but now fate had a cruel twist; he had inadvertently walked right into it, and he couldn't help but feel annoyed.</p><p>The situation didn't allow him much time to think.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately formed a plan: he absolutely couldn't be exposed!</p><p>The spectacle of this cultivator's escape was massive; the demon soldiers would certainly be drawn here.</p><p>Behind the escaping light, a dark cloud was rolling in—likely the pursuers.</p><p>Without a doubt, it must be a demon marquis!</p><p>At this moment, this was the center of the storm. Once exposed, he would inevitably be considered an accomplice.</p><p>The Celestial Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom were sworn enemies; Qin Sang didn't expect the demon marquis to show him any mercy.</p><p>Fighting a demon marquis in the Gui Fang Kingdom was not wise. Even at his peak, Qin Sang wouldn't act without absolute certainty.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had no idea what this person had done to attract multiple demon marquises.</p><p>“The enemy's attention is on this person; if I hide completely, I should be able to evade detection…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>It was too late to leave now; the escaping light was rapidly approaching.</p><p>His Wooden Body form was agile and unpredictable in combat, but his escape speed was ordinary.</p><p>Remaining still, blending with the plants and trees, is the best way to hide.</p><p>Thinking quickly, Qin Sang immediately left the mountaintop, leaping several times through the woods to avoid the pursuer's direction. He appeared in a secluded, low-lying valley, merging his body with an ancient tree, instantly becoming silent.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A brilliant white light pierced the air.</p><p>Suddenly, the white light dimmed, pausing mid-air, then transforming into a sword beam descending from the heavens, landing on a peak, revealing a Daoist.</p><p>A spiritual sword circled him.</p><p>The Daoist's breath was somewhat ragged, his clothes wrinkled in several places, as if he had just been through a great battle.</p><p>He glanced back, seeing a rolling black cloud behind him. His expression darkened further. He let out a sigh, took out a porcelain bottle, and poured out a jade-white pill.</p><p>The Daoist swallowed the pill, about to cultivate its energy, when his body stiffened slightly, his eyes flashing brightly.</p><p>"Who!"</p><p>As the shout left his mouth, his spiritual sword trembled, shooting out like a dragon!</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The Daoist unleashed three thousand-zhang-long sword energies, targeting an inconspicuous valley.</p><p>There, lush vegetation formed a green carpet of dense treetops covering the entire valley, leaving no gaps.</p><p>The valley was not quiet; insects and beasts were terrified by the formidable pressure.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword energy fell, instantly shredding the vegetation in the valley, sending countless wood chips flying, leaving utter chaos.</p><p>Amid the chaos, a clang of metal resounded, and the central sword energy dissipated, seemingly colliding with something hard.</p><p>From the debris, Qin Sang was forced to reveal himself, his gaze as dark as water.</p><p>He hadn't expected this person to stop here to take medicine, nor that this person's spiritual perception would be so sharp, attacking without warning.</p><p>Even his spiritual wood form hadn't escaped the person's perception, being forced out with a single sword strike.</p><p>The Daoist raised his sword to strike again, then saw Qin Sang in his tree-like form.</p><p>Qin Sang also saw the other's appearance clearly at the same time.</p><p>Their eyes met, both astonished.</p><p>"It's you?"</p><p>The Daoist recognized Qin Sang immediately; this kind of spiritual wood form was too unique.</p><p>Seemingly ignoring Qin Sang's dark expression, the Daoist recalled his spiritual sword, joyfully saying, "What a coincidence! Daoist friend, I've been deeply grateful for your mercy that day. I've been preoccupied, unable to visit you in the Immortal City, but unexpectedly, I've encountered you again here."</p><p>"Indeed, quite a coincidence!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, staring at the Daoist.</p><p>This Daoist was the sword cultivator he had encountered in Star Valley!</p><p>Since arriving in Ju Shan, Crane Song Mountain, Qin Sang had only left the city twice, and both times he encountered this person.</p><p>Even excluding the boundless Evil Plains and Evil Sea, the two governance areas and two mountains were vast and boundless – what a coincidence!</p><p>This encounter was even more absurd.</p><p>He had come a long way on orders from the Daoist Court, secretly entering Gui Fang country to gather herbs – and yet he encountered the Daoist outside Ju Shan!</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's expression and surveying the surrounding terrain, the Daoist understood and apologetically said, "I thought it was a demon waiting for an opportunity to ambush me; I didn't expect…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind the Daoist.</p><p>A black cloud billowed there, revealing the aura of a Nascent Soul stage demon; the black cloud showed no signs of stopping.</p><p>This wasn't the time to argue with the Daoist. Qin Sang said nothing, instantly concealing his spiritual wood form.  Lightning flashed on his body, his wings spread, transforming into a streak of lightning as he fled.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Daoist had almost completely refined the pill and hurriedly pursued, wielding his sword light.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly glanced at the Daoist. He needed to ascertain the situation first. Reason held back his impulse to strike.</p><p>Their situation was extremely disadvantageous; it was essentially created by the Daoist.</p><p>If he hadn't been exposed and had hidden, cooperating with the Daoist, there might have been a chance to kill this demon marquis.</p><p>But his strength hadn't recovered, and only certain methods could threaten a Nascent Soul expert. The Daoist, too, had clearly been through several battles and was in poor condition.</p><p>A direct confrontation, given their current states, even if they joined forces, would lead to a protracted battle.</p><p>"Entangling you was my fault,"</p><p>The Daoist said sincerely, "Now that the situation has come to this, we must first find a way to escape danger. Demons surround this place, and more than one demon marquis is pursuing me.  The demon kingdoms near Gui Fang are likely to have received orders, and the way forward is impassable, but I have prepared an escape route. If we join forces, we can certainly escape!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. What had the Daoist done to attract the pursuit of so many demon marquises?</p><p>He knew the Daoist wasn't exaggerating.</p><p>The summons contained some information about the Marquis. The Marquis was a light spirit bird that attained enlightenment, and the black cloud was clearly not the Marquis’s power.</p><p>At least two Demon Lords are here!</p><p>The Daoist confirmed there were more.  He was ambushed by two Demon Lords besides the one who was waiting, one of whom possessed extraordinary escape techniques.  The Daoist, severely wounded the Demon Lord in a desperate struggle, buying himself a chance to escape.</p><p>That Demon Lord will catch up soon after recovering.</p><p>The other Demon Lord is quite cunning, keeping a distance and waiting for its companion.</p><p>In his prime, using his Thunder Escape technique, he might have shaken off his pursuers.</p><p>Unfortunately…</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Daoist, unconvinced by his words, coldly saying, “You dared to cause trouble in a Demon Lord's territory, did you not expect to be ambushed?”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the Daoist lacked anxiety despite their predicament.</p><p>If the Daoist were truly out of options, Qin Sang would find a way to escape alone; she wouldn't die for him.</p><p>“Friend Daoist's perception is keen. I did have a couple of last resorts, but they are difficult to use. I thought I’d be fighting to the death today, but unexpectedly I’ve encountered you again…”</p><p>The Daoist glanced at the pursuers, his tone hardening. “I was about to ask for your opinion, Friend Daoist.  Should we join forces to kill this demon? Bringing the Demon Lord's corpse back to the Daoist court would be a great feat!”</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p>The Daoist enjoys taking risks, doesn't he?</p><p>She mused that she did possess means of threatening a Demon Lord, but each was extremely draining. Even if she could kill this demon, what if they encountered stronger enemies later?</p><p>She only met the Daoist twice, both times resulting in conflict, even if it was a misunderstanding. Qin Sang couldn't fully trust him.</p><p>She hadn't forgotten her objective: retrieving the Four Seasons Dream Flower.</p><p>Her own breakthrough was the priority. There would be other opportunities later; why take unnecessary risks?</p><p>Qin Sang firmly refused.</p><p>The Daoist praised, “Friend Daoist is indeed cautious! In that case, let's try to scare this demon away.”</p><p>As they flew over countless mountains, they spotted demon soldiers preparing an ambush.</p><p>The Daoist sent a message, and Qin Sang, showing surprise, pondered before agreeing.</p><p>Soon, both descended from the air.</p><p>Below lay a vast forest, strong winds rustling the trees.</p><p>They disappeared into the woods.</p><p>The black clouds pursued, a majestic black-spotted leopard demon standing atop them.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>The Daoist sat under a tree, his spiritual sword hanging before his chest, vibrating slightly, seemingly resonating with something.</p><p>His eyes were closed, oblivious to his surroundings.</p><p>Standing beside him, Qin Sang felt a degree of astonishment.  The Daoist had entrusted everything to her, completely focused on his swordsmanship, not worried about her betraying him?</p><p>However, having made a promise, Qin Sang wouldn't act treacherously.  She glanced upwards and raised her palm.</p><p>In her hand was a palm-sized, ancient bronze bell, octagonal, somewhat translucent.</p><p>It wasn’t a physical bell but a talisman given by the Daoist.</p><p>Judging by his tone, he had great confidence in the talisman, especially since it could be activated solely with blood energy.</p><p>Just then, the black-spotted leopard demon spewed black flames, engulfing the forest below.</p><p>The flames surrounded them. Under the cover of fire, thin black rays, like threads, attacked stealthily.</p><p>Though hidden, they couldn't escape the eyes of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly summoned the bell, remaining vigilant.</p><p>The bell soared, transforming into a giant bell shielding them.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>With a deafening clang, the bell shook violently; the thin black rays possessed incredible power.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, her face flushed, astonished by the talisman’s power, but managed to withstand the Demon Lord’s attack.</p><p>However, the talisman's power was limited. No amount of blood energy could stop it from dissipating.</p><p>The black-spotted leopard saw through the bell's nature.  It snorted, its eyes gleaming, and the black flames intensified, burning the bell.</p><p>The talisman's power rapidly faded.</p><p>But that time was enough.</p><p>The Daoist abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp as swords. His spiritual sword hummed, shooting out.</p><p>The sword light was dazzling, the world seemed to fade.</p><p>The surrounding elemental energy wasn't just being stirred.  It was being drawn to the sword, explosively increasing its power to a terrifying degree, leaving both Qin Sang and the leopard terrified.</p><p>This strike seemed to cut them off from the world.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened. The Daoist's display was like a legendary Transcendence cultivator manipulating the world's elemental energy!</p><p>The black-spotted leopard looked incredulous, exclaiming in terror,  “Grand Master?”</p><p></p>
