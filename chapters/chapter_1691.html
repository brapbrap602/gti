<h1>Chapter 1682: The Deal</h1><p>BOOM!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>…</p><p>Mount Disu trembled incessantly, the tremors growing stronger, shaking the surrounding area violently.  The aftershocks spread far and wide, affecting much of the legacy estate.</p><p>Most striking were the five-colored clouds swirling around the mountain, expanding at an accelerating rate, threatening to engulf Mount Disu entirely.  Visible within the clouds were clashing spiritual lights, the source of the shaking.</p><p>This was due to the Five Element Crown, the core of the seal, separating from the seal. The Five Element Divine Prohibition had been able to coexist and maintain the cycle of the five elements for so many years, thanks in no small part to the Crown.</p><p>With the loss of the artifact that governed the five elements, the seal became unbalanced, and internal conflicts intensified dramatically.</p><p>Qin Sang, hidden within the seal, felt the changes most acutely. The seal’s power was becoming increasingly chaotic, the Divine Prohibition showing signs of losing control, its power expanding outwards.</p><p>The energy within the seal was in turmoil.  Qin Sang could leave the stone house, but he dared not leave the seal or Mount Disu. He wasn't sure if the two Nascent Soul cultivators could spare any attention, if they were still watching Mount Disu.  Clearly they weren’t fighting with all their might, and any sudden movement on his part could expose him.</p><p>The best opportunity would be when their battle reached its peak.</p><p>If this continued, the complete imbalance of the Five Element Divine Prohibition would inevitably trigger a cataclysmic explosion, destroying Mount Disu.</p><p>The cultivators outside dared not approach Mount Disu, nor were they capable of resolving the problem with the seal.</p><p>Some, horrified by the demonic body's power, chose to withdraw to avoid being caught in the crossfire; the aftershocks of the Nascent Soul cultivators’ battle were beyond their endurance.</p><p>Others, bolder, saw this as a heaven-sent opportunity.</p><p>Fortune favors the bold!</p><p>If the Nascent Soul cultivators could subdue the demonic body, all would be well.  If they failed, the cultivation world would face utter annihilation—hiding would be pointless.  It might be better to seize the moment, gathering the treasures of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect while they fought, strengthening themselves, and hopefully extending their lives.</p><p>The descendants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, in particular, would need to hide no matter which side won.</p><p>With this in mind, the cultivators stopped focusing on the Nascent Soul battle, scattering to various locations. Figures began appearing in the hidden realms, palaces, and pavilions of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's legacy estate.</p><p>The estate suddenly buzzed with activity, filled with shimmering lights.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King and the Huiguang Saint were too preoccupied to pay attention. Subduing the demonic body was paramount.</p><p>The moon shone down on the demonic body.  Water met sky.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King’s attack was spectacular. A whirlpool of spiritual water formed a cage, drawing in moonlight that concentrated on the demonic body, forming heavy armor-like restraints, restricting its movement.</p><p>Soon, the demonic body was nearly invisible, submerged in water and moonlight.</p><p>However, no one was relieved.  The demonic energy within the water-moon cage showed no sign of being suppressed; instead, it relentlessly attacked the cage, each attack stronger than the last, emitting a terrifying aura that chilled everyone to the bone.</p><p>The battle formation was established.</p><p>The Huiguang Saint, at the heart of the formation, was undoubtedly the core of the Zen Meditation Arhat Array.</p><p>The others spread out to surround the demonic body.  The halos behind their heads grew brighter, each appearing like a devout Buddhist follower, the center of their halos faintly displaying the phantom of a Buddha statue, bearing a resemblance to the Huiguang Saint.</p><p>In truth, within the array, they were connected to the Huiguang Saint's mind. Their energies were unified, a crude but far superior arrangement to fighting individually.</p><p>As the core of the formation, the Huiguang Saint’s every move was perceptible to the others. Through this connection, they sensed something amiss about the Huiguang Saint.</p><p>It seemed…he was injured!</p><p>Being astute, they connected this to the Five Element Pill and previous rumors.</p><p>They deduced that the Huiguang Saint must have encountered danger and been injured while exploring the Wuwang Palace, which explained why he couldn't fight at full strength and why he had to keep them there. Fortunately, the Qinghu Saint King seemed to be in good condition, preventing them from facing the ancient demon's full might.</p><p>When the Wise Light Saint offered the Five Elements Pills to encourage everyone, the demon’s counterattack suddenly became fierce.  Giant waves erupted from the center of the spirit water vortex, surging outwards and shattering even the nearby flying swords.  The suspended lake, created by Hou Lingyu, suddenly sank dozens of meters, as if the heavens were collapsing.</p><p>Cultivators outside the mountain were terrified by this spectacle.</p><p>Simultaneously with the wave’s eruption, a five-colored beam shot from the vortex center, instantly dyeing the moonlight five colors and hurtling towards the moon.  This was not an ordinary moon, but a manifestation of the Green Fox Saint King’s power. If the Five Elements Crown shattered it, freeing the demon, it would be even harder to suppress it later.</p><p>This five-elemental light was clearly more powerful than any before. The demon's strength was still increasing!</p><p>After the Five Elements Pills, the Wise Light Saint promised further rewards.</p><p>Seeing this, the Wise Light Saint fell silent, chanting Buddhist mantras, raising his right hand, and pressing down.</p><p>“Amitabha Buddha!”</p><p>At this moment, the demon still instinctively intended to devour the Poison King, and the Wise Light Saint’s Dharma Wheel needed to protect the grey cocoon.  He produced a bodhi bead from his palm – a reddish-gold bead engraved with a majestic Buddha image.  The moment he held it, sutra chanting echoed throughout the universe.</p><p>No one could understand the sutras, but everyone felt an inexplicable heaviness, knowing it was a treasure for subduing demons.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The bodhi bead transformed into a stream of reddish-gold light.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fan Laomo and the others sensed the Wise Light Saint’s thoughts, precisely seizing the moment to unleash their prepared spells and treasures.</p><p>Fan Laomo’s Myriad Illusion Dark Lotus was damaged, so he again summoned the yellow brass bowl.  Yue Liting suspended the three-legged cauldron, its mouth aimed at the vortex center, as Xuanhuang light surged.  Mo Xingdao’s Xuan Qi moved unseen.  He Gao Zhenren’s expression was indifferent, his jade smoke flowing and changing endlessly.</p><p>Only Qin Sang’s avatar was the weakest.  The Wise Light Saint, considering this, positioned him where the pressure was least.  But it was only relative. The avatar summoned the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, its energy condensing into snow, but he found it extremely difficult. He hurriedly raised his hand above his head, manifesting a Xuan Qi hand to barely stabilize his position. Secretly, the avatar had already prepared the Ice Soul Divine Light, ready to strike.</p><p>They inherited different schools of thought, their powers completely different, yet within the Zen Arhat Formation, guided by the Wise Light Saint, they cooperated seamlessly.</p><p>In an instant, the battlefield shimmered with various strange lights. Everyone’s attacks merged into the stream of light created by the bodhi bead.  Combined, their power was like thunder, intercepting the five-colored beam before it hit the moon.</p><p>It was at this moment that the avatar diverted his attention to contact Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao glanced at the avatar, his expression strange. This person, merely at the mid-Yuan Ying stage, was the weakest here; he wondered where the confidence came from to covet the Five Elements Pills.  He moved slightly, about to respond, when a non-human shriek pierced the air.</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King’s face changed drastically.  She only managed to say “be careful,” then flicked her jade fingers, slightly opening her mouth to hastily exhale a breath of orchid fragrance, infusing it into the spirit water.</p><p>After this, the Green Fox Saint King’s complexion paled.</p><p>Instantly, the giant waves of the suspended lake froze, as if solidified. The water became clearer, like a mirror suspended in mid-air.  But the demon’s shriek instantly pierced the suspended lake.  One could see five-colored streams of light shooting wildly from the vortex center, instantly churning the lake.</p><p>The sound of cracking echoed continuously.  Visible fractures appeared in the lake water, especially around the vortex center, which seemed about to collapse, revealing the demon’s form.</p><p>The Wise Light Saint’s eyes widened. The bodhi bead, carrying its residual power, struck downwards, directly at the demon.</p><p>The demon, sensing this, abruptly raised its head, its eyes filled with madness and cruelty.  It let out a low growl, and the jade pieces on the Five Elements Crown lit up simultaneously, shooting out five beams of light.</p><p>These five beams of light, instead of merging into a five-colored beam when colliding with the bodhi bead, remained separate.</p><p>Seeing this, the Wise Light Saint felt a sudden ominous premonition, shouting, and striking a Buddhist seal towards the bodhi bead. Simultaneously, the five beams of light suddenly merged, creating a powerful binding force.</p><p>The luminous beads dimmed, their glow fading. Fortunately,  Sage Huiguang intervened just in time, delivering a powerful blow that forced the demonic form back.</p><p>The demonic power was terrifying, causing everyone present to be greatly alarmed.</p><p>"With the power it displays in this form, we cannot face it directly.  Let alone capture it alive, even killing it would cost a great price.  Unless we separate the demonic body from the five-colored crown, or we all risk severe injury,"</p><p>King Qinghu's breath hitched.  Taking advantage of the distraction caused by Sage Huiguang's attack, she hastily stabilized the floating lake.  </p><p>She sent a voice transmission to Sage Huiguang, her tone far from optimistic.</p><p>Sage Huiguang remained silent.</p><p>King Qinghu coldly said, "These few are not enough. Summon the remaining Nascent Soul cultivators below, form a battle array, and wear down the demonic body through attrition."</p><p>Her tone was cruel, showing no concern for the potential loss of life.</p><p>Sage Huiguang glanced downwards.</p><p>It wasn't a matter of unwillingness, but of inability. Firstly, these cultivators were disorganized and might simply become food for the ancient demon. Secondly, they were all incredibly cautious, quickly retreating from Mount Disu at the first sign of danger.  Forcibly summoning them would only lead to them scattering; who would be foolish enough to come and die? Only Elder Fan and his group were trapped and couldn't escape.</p><p>Those妖王 (yao wang, demon kings) who had received the Saint King's orders were clearly hesitant, moving forward and then stopping, deliberately delaying.</p><p>Under these circumstances, only the disciples of Ganlu Temple would readily obey his commands, but none were present.</p><p>While speaking, Sage Huiguang and King Qinghu adjusted their strategy.  Instead of focusing on suppressing the demonic form immediately, they would look for weaknesses, waiting for the demonic form's rationality to be eroded by the heavenly demonic sound;  a chance might then arise.</p><p>The spiritual treasure with its own spirit, combined with the ancient demon's inherent power, proved far more formidable than anticipated.</p><p>As the situation eased slightly, Mo Xingdao breathed a sigh of relief and replied, "If you are confident in obtaining the Five Elements Pill, we can discuss it. If I survive and manage to bring the Lingxi Immortal Fruit out…"</p><p>His expression was filled with bitterness.</p><p>In this situation, the Lingxi Immortal Fruit was undoubtedly a source of chaos, attracting countless greedy eyes. He had no idea how the old monk planned to deal with him.  He likely would have to use the fruit to save his own life.</p><p>Of course, if the old monk kept his promise and allowed him to take the Lingxi Immortal Fruit, he would gladly exchange it for the Five Elements Pill, as the latter would benefit him greatly.</p><p>The transformed being nodded silently, understanding Mo Xingdao's predicament. This was just a starting point; he would prioritize his own escape before considering the trade.</p><p>The battle intensified, the demonic form's terrifying power on full display.</p><p>The transformed being remained calm; the stronger the demonic form, the more valuable the items he would offer.</p><p>After a while, the transformed being suddenly looked up at Sage Huiguang.</p><p>"Senior, do you recognize this object?"</p><p>At the same time, cold air gathered above his head, transforming into a black iron chain.</p><p>Everyone was focused on dealing with the demonic form, but they were startled by the transformed being's actions and turned to look.</p><p>Upon seeing the chain, Sage Huiguang's expression tightened, and he exclaimed in surprise,</p><p>"The Demon-Binding Chain!"</p><p>Someone in Zhongzhou actually recognized this treasure!</p><p>The transformed being felt a slight relief.</p><p>Sage Huiguang's eyes shone brightly. "You possess the Demon-Binding Chain?"</p><p>The Demon-Binding Chain was an ancient treasure specifically designed to restrain ancient demons.  With it, the chances of capturing the demonic form alive would greatly increase.</p><p>The transformed being hesitated before replying, "I have indeed seen a Demon-Binding Chain, but it was damaged, and it requires a special spirit array to be effective…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Sage Huiguang eagerly interrupted, "The Wuxiang Immortal Sect once obtained a damaged Demon-Binding Chain and a corresponding Demon-Subduing Array from the Immortal Palace.  They attempted repairs, but due to improper usage, the chain was destroyed by the ancient demon. If your chain isn't too badly damaged, I have a method to repair it."</p><p>So the Wuxiang Immortal Sect had attempted restoration.</p><p>The transformed being's mind stirred. He sighed, "Unfortunately, the Demon-Binding Chain is severely damaged, and the fragments have been reforged into other treasures. It cannot be repaired in the short term."</p><p>Even if it could be repaired, the Meteorite God Whip wasn't here; he'd left it for his apprentice to study.</p><p>Upon hearing this, an uproar erupted, with many inwardly cursing Qin Sang.</p><p>The transformed being, seemingly unaware, hesitated for a moment before manifesting another object. "Since Senior recognizes the Demon-Binding Chain, you may know of another treasure of the same lineage, one superior in rank."</p><p>He had manifested the Demon-Sealing Stake!</p><p>The Demon-Sealing Stake, forged into a banner pole and incorporated into the Ten Directions Yanluo Banner, had sealed the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, accompanying him for many years. Now, he was preparing to use it as a bargaining chip!</p><p>Although divided into banner segments, the internal restrictions were intact.  The soul energy could be easily restored.</p><p>"The Demon-Sealing Stake!"</p><p>Sage Huiguang, with his vast knowledge, instantly recognized the treasure.</p><p>Having revealed it, the transformed being no longer hesitated. He cut the Demon-Sealing Stake in two, declaring righteously, "This treasure is also damaged, but only in one place. If Senior possesses the means to repair it, it could resolve this urgent situation. I am willing to contribute this treasure to suppress the ancient demon and protect the world!"</p><p>However, as he spoke, his gaze fell upon the jade bottle containing the Five Elements Pill in the old monk's hand.</p><p>"What sect do you belong to, benefactor?" Sage Huiguang, concealing his delight, narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"I am Xie family disciple from Fudou County, Zhuozhou. Elder Lu Zhang of the Bunan Mountain is a close friend of mine."</p>
