<h1>Chapter 836: The Leopard Demon</h1><p>Demonic beasts surrounded the island.</p><p>Emerald Island had become a demonic beast paradise.</p><p>Strangely, this situation had persisted for over three months. The beasts surrounded the island but didn't attack, nor did they retreat.</p><p>The cultivators on the island felt no relief.</p><p>As time passed, more and more demonic beasts continuously converged, reaching alarming numbers and occupying vast swathes of the sea surrounding Emerald Island.</p><p>Initially, the island's cultivators, out of caution, didn't launch an attack, adopting a defensive strategy.  Conventionally, demonic beasts would leave after a few days if they couldn't breach the protective formation.</p><p>By the time they realized something was amiss, it was too late.  Surrounded by so many demonic beasts, no one could relax.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the edge of the beast horde.</p><p>A group of demonic beasts formed a circle, within which were several unusual-looking greater demons.</p><p>There was a fish demon with four limbs, as white and tender as a baby's.</p><p>There was an elegant crane, its feathers snow-white, its eyes haughty and untamed, looking down upon everything.</p><p>……</p><p>Among them, a leopard demon was the most striking. This demon had a peculiar appearance, its body not covered in fur, but in fine scales.  It had a sharp horn on its forehead, looking exceptionally divine.</p><p>Their eyes were clear and lively, showing high intelligence, markedly different from the surrounding demonic beasts.</p><p>Astonishingly, these demonic beasts could speak, communicating fluently, yet they were clearly not in the transformation stage.</p><p>There was only one explanation: these demonic beasts had consumed the precious Emperor's Flowing Nectar, prematurely awakening their intelligence.</p><p>The Emperor's Flowing Nectar only appears when a demonic beast transforms. Did these beasts each have a transformation stage demon behind them?</p><p>Some were on the water's surface, others floated in the air. The other demonic beasts were clearly afraid of them, and the vicinity was silent.</p><p>Arguments could be heard from within the circle, seemingly the leopard demon confronting the other greater demons.</p><p>"You have two months to gather all your subordinates and attack this island.  Disobey, and you die!"</p><p>The leopard demon roared, issuing its command, its gaze cold and piercing, intimidating the other demonic beasts.</p><p>The other demonic beasts exchanged glances, some showing discontent.</p><p>Their cultivation levels were comparable to the leopard demon's, but they were wary of its identity, though not overly fearful.</p><p>The crane demon snorted, its voice sharp, "The Great King ordered me to harass the humans, to keep them preoccupied and divert their attention.  He never said to assault a human stronghold, especially a large island with a Nascent Soul cultivator! With the Great King absent, we don't know how much blood our brethren will have to shed to break the protective formation.  Even if we break through, so what? If the human Nascent Soul wants to escape, we can't stop him.  And if he finds an opportunity, killing one or two of us wouldn't be difficult!"</p><p>Other demonic beasts echoed the sentiment, stating that their Great Kings had given similar orders, unwilling to risk following the leopard demon.</p><p>They used the orders of their transformation stage demons to pressure the leopard demon, but the leopard demon dismissed them, saying coldly, "I came here bearing the Serpent King's command. Even your Great Kings must obey our Serpent Clan.  Whoever dares defy my orders is opposing the Serpent Clan! I'd like to see how many heads you have!"</p><p>The leopard demon, born with a leopard's body, yet claiming to represent the Serpent Clan, appeared comical, but no demonic beast dared to laugh.</p><p>Looking at its scales and horn, so different from other leopard demons, it might truly possess serpent blood.</p><p>Hearing this, the other greater demons held their breath, exchanging glances, their气势 involuntarily weakening.</p><p>Although they suspected the leopard demon might be bluffing, the Serpent Clan's oppressive power was too strong.</p><p>Moreover, part of what the leopard demon said was true; their Great Kings wouldn't dare oppose the Serpent Clan.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The fish demon spoke weakly, "The Great King said this matter is of utmost importance, a plan orchestrated by the Serpent King, uniting almost half the Demonic Sea's forces.  If our unauthorized actions alert the cultivators to the Great King's absence, jeopardizing the Serpent King's grand plan…"</p><p>Seeing the other demons falter, the leopard demon, smugly, softened its tone, "How can a single location like ours affect the grand plan? Besides, aren't we also distracting and deceiving the cultivators? My goal isn't extermination, but to find someone. This person is very important to our Serpent Clan, having committed a grave sin, enraging the Serpent King.  The Serpent King personally ordered this person's death. Remember his aura, and if you sense him, eliminate him at all costs!  Killing him is a great merit!"</p><p>The person the leopard demon spoke of was Qin Sang.</p><p>That day, Qin Sang reacted quickly, decisively escaping. The Serpent King pursued him relentlessly but failed to catch him, yet memorized Qin Sang's aura.</p><p>"Also, if you see someone using a magical treasure of this shape, it must be him…"</p><p>The leopard demon dipped its forepaw into the water, a water screen rising, displaying the shimmering image of a spiral shell.</p><p>The spiral shell resembled Qin Sang's Star Conch by seventy to eighty percent.</p><p>The demons silently memorized the shell's shape, seemingly unaware of the Star Conch's unique properties.</p><p>Then, the demons dispersed, vanishing into the depths of the Demonic Sea, returning to assemble their troops.</p><p>The leopard demon, its goal achieved, watched their retreating figures, a cunning glint in its eyes. Turning back to Emerald Island, its gaze turned greedy.</p><p>……</p><p>The atmosphere on Emerald Island was heavy.</p><p>Every time the island's cultivators saw the sky-obscuring demonic aura and dark clouds, they couldn't help but worry, fear showing in their eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang led a team of Foundation Establishment cultivators, performing patrol and警戒 duties.</p><p>As night fell, the patrol finally ended, and they could rest for a while.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his temporary cave dwelling and was surprised to find Lady Liu and Jin Ying there.</p><p>After Xiang Yi's death, Jin Ying's attitude towards Qin Sang had become more respectful.</p><p>Although Lady Liu had sworn not to reveal the details of the battle, with Jin Ying's intelligence, she could guess some of it.</p><p>"When did you two arrive? Has something happened?"</p><p>Qin Sang invited them to sit.</p><p>They also had duties, and with little time even for cultivation lately, they rarely met.</p><p>"Can't we visit Fellow Daoist without something happening?"</p><p>With her enemy dealt with, Lady Liu finally emerged from her shadow.</p><p>After joking, Lady Liu's smile faded as she revealed surprising news, "The Island Lord is considering abandoning the island and breaking through the siege!"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned, looking at Jin Ying.</p><p>Jin Ying also looked grave, nodding heavily.  She had received the news through the Nine Star Association, from the Merchant Alliance.</p><p>"Has the situation deteriorated to this point?"</p><p>Qin Sang found it hard to believe. Abandoning the island meant not only the Island Lord giving up his centuries-old foundation, but also the lives of most cultivators on the island!</p><p>Without the protective formation, how many would survive?</p><p>Jin Ying said gravely, "The Merchant Alliance also learned this today. The Island Lord's contact with the outside world has been cut off; no messages can get in or out. We're an isolated island now.  Two days ago, a large number of demonic beasts gathered, an alarming number. They're restless, not like they're bluffing. They might attack soon."</p><p>――</p><p>Writing on my phone on the train.
