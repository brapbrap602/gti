<h1>Chapter 2127: The Wax Figure</h1><p>Holy Lake.</p><p>Min Zhuo dismissed everyone else, ordering the clan elders to guard the entrance, and entered the sacred hall with only Min Shu.</p><p>“Father…”</p><p>Min Shu wanted to say something, but Min Zhuo stopped him with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Min Zhuo sat cross-legged in front of the altar, took out a jade bottle, swallowed the pill inside, and as the medicinal power dispersed, his aura gradually stabilized and slightly improved.</p><p>However, the worry in Min Shu's eyes didn't diminish in the slightest. His father's injuries were too severe; these pills could only temporarily delay the deterioration, not facilitate a rapid recovery.</p><p>Those foreign races were held back by the Lu King's army and posed no threat, but within the Tainted Lands, ferocious beasts and other dangers still lurked.</p><p>The source of Azure Spirit Qi was mysterious and unpredictable, rife with peril.  One wouldn't dare approach it without reaching the second level of the Emptiness Realm.  In his father's current state, forcing his way in was extremely dangerous.</p><p>After refining the medicinal power and circulating his Qi for a moment, Min Zhuo raised his hand, beckoning a jade casket to fly out from under the altar.</p><p>Min Shu looked over curiously. His father was grooming him to be the next clan leader and didn't hide any of the clan's treasures from him, yet this was the first time he had seen this jade casket.</p><p>*Click!*</p><p>The jade casket opened.</p><p>Surprise flashed across Min Shu's eyes. Inside was a casket filled with white wax!</p><p>It looked like ordinary white wax, and Min Shu didn't sense any unusual fluctuations.</p><p>Min Zhuo's lips moved slightly, muttering incantations. He successively struck several hand seals towards the stone pillars within the hall. Azure light flickered on the surfaces of the pillars, revealing dense runes, forming a grand formation together.</p><p>The jade casket floated at the center of the formation.</p><p>Then, all the stone pillars vibrated, simultaneously shooting out beams of azure light, which converged on the jade casket. Immediately afterwards, a pale azure flame ignited within the casket.</p><p>The flames burned on the surface of the white wax, as if burning away a layer of seal. The wax began to melt. Min Zhuo struck another hand seal, and the wax flowed out like oil.</p><p>*Drip!*</p><p>*Drip!*</p><p>…</p><p>The melted wax dripped onto the floor, piling up to the height of a person. Then, it started to wriggle like a living creature, gradually growing limbs and a head, taking on a human-like silhouette, transforming into a "wax figure."</p><p>The white wax continued to flow on the wax figure's body. It had no facial features, nor feet. Beneath it was a pool of wax, leaving a clear trail of wax on the floor as it moved.</p><p>The wax figure slowly "walked" towards Min Zhuo. Its movements were extremely slow. Min Zhuo stood up, and when the wax figure reached him, he suddenly stepped forward.</p><p>The two figures overlapped.</p><p>In the next moment, Min Zhuo passed right through the wax figure. The instant he left its body, his complexion became visibly rosy, his aura rapidly surged, no longer weak, as if his injuries had instantly healed.</p><p>Min Shu's eyes widened in disbelief. He hurriedly looked at the wax figure and saw clear facial features forming on its face, identical to his father's.  Even the wax figure's complexion was the same as his father's earlier, appearing extremely frail.</p><p>This scene looked as if Min Zhuo had absorbed the wax figure's life force and transferred his injuries onto it, leaving himself completely recovered.</p><p>Min Zhuo lowered his head, looked at his hands, then inspected his inner body, secretly letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p>The Chang You Clan's ancestors had also known prosperity. After countless years of erosion, some of their heritage remained, such as this casket of white wax.</p><p>In the vast world, besides the major races, countless unique races of beings existed. Throughout the endless ages, wars raged. Some became slaves, some hid in corners, struggling to survive, unknown to the world, and many had already gone extinct.</p><p>Legend spoke of a creature called the Wax People, though Min Zhuo wasn't sure if this box of white wax was truly refined from them.</p><p>The clan's ancient texts didn't record the origin of the jade casket, only the function of this white wax.</p><p>A severely injured person could awaken the wax figure, allowing it to bear their injuries and restore themselves to peak strength. This wouldn't heal the injuries but merely transfer them to the wax figure temporarily.</p><p>During this process, the wax figure continuously burned. When it burned out, the injuries would immediately erupt on the original host, doubled in severity.</p><p>Once the wax figure burned out, it would vanish completely from the world. The ancestral teachings mandated that it should only be used in moments of life or death for the Chang You Clan, to confront dire crises.</p><p>As of today, the Chang You Clan only had this one jade casket left.</p><p>The wax figure stood frozen in place, eyes closed tightly, flames burning on its body, emitting a fragrant scent.</p><p>Min Zhuo looked at Min Shu and handed him a token. "Activate this formation within the hall and guard the wax figure.  Allow no one to enter the ancestral hall!"</p><p>"I obey, Father!"</p><p>Min Shu bowed in acceptance, his face filled with excitement and reverence.</p><p>…</p><p>The Grand Preceptor stepped out of the Lu King's carriage and subconsciously looked towards the east, gazing for a long while, then flew to a mountain peak, lightly tapping his foot.</p><p>A moment later, a figure flashed into existence, the Grand Tutor.</p><p>“What matter requires the Grand Preceptor's summons?”</p><p>The Grand Tutor feigned ignorance.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor cupped his hands in respect. “I wish to consult the Grand Tutor. Aside from the Yellow Scroll of the Profound Earth, can the Eight Trigrams Map of Unending Change manifest other divine abilities?”</p><p>The Grand Tutor let out an "Oh."  “Are you preparing to continue the assault?”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor explained, “That True Person Qin has now revealed his true cultivation. It is evident that the Great Compassion Zen Temple holds a significant position.  There must be an important Dharma altar within. The King has decreed that we swiftly conquer the temple and destroy this altar!”</p><p>“A sound judgment! However, that True Person Qin has truly defied expectations. Li Yue is likely unequal to the task. But, if the Grand Preceptor were to personally act, success would be assured, wouldn't it?” The Grand Tutor probed.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor didn't deny it, uttering a modest "I wouldn't dare."  "The enemy might still be concealing their strength. This old man can only do his best."</p><p>“Is the Grand Preceptor referring to Attendant Xia? This old man has some understanding of that old fellow. Attendant Xia is not one to swallow his pride. If he were still alive, he would have already brought True Person Qin to our doorstep!”</p><p>The Grand Tutor shook his head slightly.  Like the Grand Preceptor, Qin Sang revealing his true strength only reinforced their previous judgment.</p><p>However, the Grand Tutor wasn't aware of how much scheming and how many safeguards the Grand Preceptor had employed to eliminate Attendant Xia, so he didn't dare to make a hasty conclusion.</p><p>“Though I am the master of the Eight Trigrams Map of Unending Change, I have entrusted it entirely to Lu Gan's control. The art of the Yellow Scroll of the Profound Earth is currently the map’s most profound divine ability.  Its initial activation, even with True Person Qin's discerning eyes, would be impossible to decipher so quickly. There is truly no need for concern.” The Grand Tutor offered reassurance.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor seized on the key point.  “Currently? Does the Grand Tutor imply that the map can still be enhanced?”</p><p>“After you conquer True Person Qin, slaughter the foreign cultivators, and preferably kill a few Void Refinement experts, the map's power might further increase,” the Grand Tutor said ambiguously, his words chillingly ruthless.</p><p>Hearing this, the Grand Preceptor's eyes flickered.  “Is the Grand Tutor using the lifeblood of our two sides’ cultivators to nourish the map?”</p><p>“Certainly not!”</p><p>The Grand Tutor vehemently shook his head, his voice deep. “This old man is wholeheartedly assisting the Lu King in overcoming his formidable enemies!”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor remained silent. The Grand Tutor and the Eight Trigrams Map of Unending Change were indeed invited by the Lu King personally. He couldn't accuse them.</p><p>When the snipe and clam grapple, the fisherman profits.  The world has always been this way. As long as they could achieve victory in this battle, allowing the Grand Tutor and the royal family to gain some benefits was acceptable.</p><p>The Grand Tutor turned, looking towards the battlefield, knowing that the Grand Preceptor was actually wary of him. He then said, "Lu Gan can now independently control the Eight Trigrams Map of Unending Change, wielding it with seamless proficiency, requiring no further guidance from this old man. In this battle, this old man shall step forth and provide support for the Grand Preceptor!”</p><p>“Then I thank the Grand Tutor in advance!”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor bowed deeply.</p><p>The Grand Tutor's guess was correct. He was indeed somewhat apprehensive.</p><p>Although he was confident that with his strength, he could freely come and go even when facing the combined assault of Qin Sang and Attendant Xia, he couldn't deny that aside from their clan's divine ability of mutual transformation, everyone relied on the Eight Trigrams Map of Unending Change for protection.</p><p>Previously, the Grand Tutor had no reason to betray them.  However, Qin Sang had displayed formidable strength, and he still couldn't produce evidence of Attendant Xia's demise. This was enough to make the Grand Tutor and the royal family waver.</p><p>Forcing the Grand Tutor out, having the Lu King keep watch over him, and letting Lu Gan independently control the Eight Trigrams Map of Unending Change was his true objective.  Him personally taking action was to show the Grand Tutor who was the true powerhouse and whose side was the right one to choose!</p><p>After conferring with the Grand Preceptor, the Grand Tutor didn't return underground but flew directly towards the Lu King's carriage.</p><p>Watching the Grand Tutor enter the carriage, the Grand Preceptor retracted his gaze and turned towards the west.</p><p>The course of the battle thus far had already exceeded his expectations. The Grand Preceptor finally understood why *that person* was so cautious of these foreign races.  Even without considering the Zhu Yan Clan's stance, these foreign races were formidable.</p><p>It was a pity *that person* was unwilling to reveal their identity, otherwise, this battle wouldn't hold any suspense.</p><p>However, risk always coexisted with reward.  They certainly wouldn't retreat.</p><p>After pondering for a long while, the Grand Preceptor issued several decrees.</p><p>The various powerhouses, upon receiving the decrees, felt a chill and hurriedly focused on circulating their Qi, awaiting the upcoming great battle.</p><p>…</p><p>Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>The Thunder Altar hung suspended in the air, upon which perched a Vermillion Bird, Qin Sang's Dharma Idol.</p><p>The Dharma Idol sat with its eyes closed, seemingly in slumber.  Far away, at the Great Compassion Zen Temple, his true body and Dharma Body also sat within the meditation hall, quietly comprehending something.</p><p>An image repeatedly flashed within his mind.</p><p>It was the entire process from the shattering of the Profound Yellow Light, the emergence of eight clear pools from the Eight Trigrams Map of Unending Change, the appearance of the painted scroll, and finally, Min Zhuo's rescue.</p><p>All of this happened almost instantaneously, but Qin Sang dissected it into individual frames.</p><p>He clearly remembered every scene; every detail was vividly imprinted in his memory.  He had tirelessly pondered over every image, every wisp of unusual aura, countless times.</p><p>While recalling, Qin Sang was also deducing. His hands rested on his knees, his fingertips occasionally twitching, with subtle fluctuations flashing.</p><p>Gradually, the scenes in his memory changed. The green mountains and clear waters, transformed from the desert, became a blurred painted scroll in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>As the Grand Tutor had said, based on a single observation, Qin Sang couldn't deduce much.  However, what the Grand Tutor didn't know was that Qin Sang didn't need to deduce every detail. As long as he could determine the approximate rank and power of this treasure, it would suffice.</p><p>Neither side disturbed Qin Sang.</p><p>After the previous battle, a period of tranquility ensued.  The enemy camp was unusually quiet, showing no signs of mobilizing troops.  But everyone understood that this truce was only temporary. The cultivators stationed in the Western Lands and the altar masters of the various Dharma altars were all using this precious time to circulate their Qi and recover.</p><p>Just then, the Azure Goat Temple’s protective formation was triggered. Shi Xue had come to visit again.</p><p>"The Tainted Qi has begun to recede, but my junior sister is still missing. What should we do now?"</p><p>Shi Xue was anxious.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had told her to wait, but she hadn't seen Liu Li yet. Something must have happened.</p><p>As for the Azure Spirit Qi, Shi Xue no longer dared to hope for it.</p><p>She had learned of the current situation through Su Nu and Tong Lingyu and knew that this was the most critical moment for the Storm Realm. Both Qin Sang and Su Nu believed that the Lu King’s forces had been demoralized, and a fierce battle was imminent. At least one of the two top experts, the Grand Tutor and the Grand Preceptor, would make a move, most likely the Grand Preceptor.</p><p>With the Tainted Qi receding now, they couldn't spare any troops and definitely couldn't compete with the Chang You Clan this time. But as long as they could win this battle, the Azure Spirit Qi would permanently belong to the Storm Realm. Temporary gains and losses were insignificant.</p><p>“I’m aware.  Return and inform Palace Master Tong to dispatch some experts from the Profound Heaven Palace to the Tainted Lands," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Alas!  This small number of people won't be able to contend with the Chang You Clan."</p><p>Shi Xue sighed, knowing that all she could do was her best and leave the rest to fate.  They could only try to grab whatever they could.</p><p>As for Liu Li's whereabouts, she believed Qin Sang wouldn't be unconcerned, but it was truly inopportune now.  She could only hope that Liu Li would be blessed with good fortune.</p><p>After seeing Shi Xue off, Qin Sang also frowned, suppressing his urge to inquire with Patriarch Yuan Xiang, pondering the various unforeseen circumstances that had arisen.</p><p>He had previously deduced that the source of the Azure Spirit Qi might conceal unknown secrets, attracting the Chang You Clan and driving Patriarch Min Zhuo to make seemingly irrational decisions.</p><p>Was it truly a coincidence that the Tainted Qi began to recede just when Patriarch Min Zhuo was injured?</p><p>Logically, facing the powerful Lu King's army, even with his suspicions, Qin Sang shouldn't be distracted at this moment.</p><p>However, Patriarch Min Zhuo could never imagine that the power of the Thunder Altar couldn't be measured by conventional standards.</p><p>Qin Sang had absolute confidence in the power of the Thunder Altar and the fourth-rank Thunder Talismans of the Thunder Oath Chapter. Back then, he had intended to rely on the Thunder Altar to negotiate with the Zhu Yan Clan, securing a sanctuary for the Storm Realm, let alone facing just one of the four royal clans of the Si You Clan.</p><p>Once fully activated, there would only be two outcomes.</p><p>Either the Grand Preceptor and the others would be annihilated by the thunder, and the Lu King’s army would be routed.</p><p>Or the Grand Preceptor and the others would miraculously survive, and the Lu King would withdraw his troops.</p><p>Unless they invited a Saint Realm expert to intervene, they certainly wouldn't dare harass the Storm Realm again.</p><p>Qin Sang's meticulous planning aimed to achieve the first outcome, which was also part of his journey of enlightenment. As for the safety of the Storm Realm, from the moment the Thunder Altar was constructed, he no longer worried.</p><p>In that case, could he truly not afford to be distracted?</p><p>Not necessarily!</p><p>The premise was that the secret at the source of the Azure Spirit Qi was worth the risk of failure.</p><p>After all, in his view, the upcoming battle, if the Grand Preceptor were to appear, would be one of the best opportunities to strike. Diverting his strength at this time could lead to the ruin of his efforts and a missed opportunity.</p><p>Great Compassion Zen Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang weighed the pros and cons, pondered for a long while, and finally, his true body, along with his Dharma Body, left the meditation hall, quietly returning to the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Atop the Thunder Altar.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Dharma Idol slowly rose, nodded to the true body, then flapped its wings, transforming into a streak of azure light, vanishing into the heavens.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Happy Qixi Festival everyone!</p>
