<h1>Chapter 1833: War Drums</h1><p>Mo Xingdao produced a jade slip and gave it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the treasures listed in the jade slip, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He was afraid that Mo Xingdao would demand extremely rare items.</p><p>Gathering these treasures would be incredibly difficult for Mo Xingdao now, but for Qin Sang, it only required another trip deeper into the Netherworld. The rest would involve spreading the news and waiting for a response.</p><p>He was about to visit Gu Master in Baishi Prefecture, hoping that going through the Dao Court would be faster.</p><p>After staying at Mo Xingdao's mansion for only an hour, Qin Sang left and travelled west, until he found Jingtai Temple, which had relocated to a mountain on the border between Jushan Prefecture and Baishi Prefecture.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru had initially intended to seek refuge in Baishi Prefecture, but later considered that being under the Dao Court's jurisdiction had many inconveniences and there was no suitable place, so he chose this location to build a branch temple as a second best option.</p><p>The senior monks of Jingtai Temple and Qin Sang were already well-acquainted. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they entered the meditation hall to discuss Buddhist teachings.</p><p>Qin Sang shared his insights without reservation, and the monks likewise did not withhold their knowledge when he sought their instruction.</p><p>It was as if Qin Sang and the monks were jointly comprehending this seal.</p><p>Leaving Jingtai Temple's branch monastery, Qin Sang continued west, entering Baishi Prefecture, first visiting Master Lingxu, and finally arriving at Gu Master's residence.</p><p>This was his first visit since their last meeting.</p><p>"Friend Daoist, you are very magnanimous, leaving such precious items in this poor Daoist's mansion. You haven't been here for a hundred years. Aren't you afraid that I'll run away with the treasure, leaving you empty-handed?" Gu Master's tone held a hint of resentment, this time, she had summoned him sternly by letter.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled in response. He certainly valued Gu Master highly. Repairing the broken drum would significantly improve his alchemy skills, making him more confident in repairing the Taiyi Star Chariot later.</p><p>However, he had prioritized cultivation for many years, delaying his alchemy work.</p><p>After all, the depths of the governance altar were extremely dangerous. Even with a repaired Taiyi Star Chariot, he would need sufficient strength to pass through the barrier between the two worlds.</p><p>"Gu Master's reputation for integrity is known to everyone. If even Gu Master cannot be trusted, I fear there are no trustworthy people in the world..."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish his flattery, Gu Master impatiently interrupted him.</p><p>"Come with me!"</p><p>Gu Master led Qin Sang into the fire chamber.</p><p>Inside the fire chamber, the flames were intensely hot, and a crimson fireball hovered in the air. Inside the fireball was the broken drum.</p><p>Flames enveloped it, but no flames actually touched the drum. The aura of the treasure remained unchanged from before.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand, and looked at Gu Master with some confusion.</p><p>"Sit!"</p><p>Gu Master pointed to the ground. After Qin Sang sat down, she sat cross-legged in front of him, and said, "Since Friend Daoist left, this poor Daoist has spent day and night with this treasure, neglecting sleep and food..."</p><p>As Gu Master spoke, Qin Sang learned about her entire process of comprehending the broken drum.</p><p>Although they had exchanged letters in the past, the details were not comprehensive.</p><p>Due to their past agreement, Gu Master explained everything in detail, clearly outlining her thoughts on comprehending the treasure, including the true meaning of the alchemic way.  Some of the content gave Qin Sang a feeling of enlightenment, making him even more respectful and attentive.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's earnest expression, Gu Master's expression softened. Finally, she asked, "How much did you understand?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, "Master, are you trying to tell me that there are two options for repairing this treasure?"</p><p>Gu Master showed satisfaction. It seemed that this man had excellent aptitude for alchemy. "A promising student! Indeed, that is my intention, but the choice is yours. First, to restore the treasure to its original state, something I am far from capable of doing. Second, I can repair the treasure using my understanding of alchemy, but this will reduce its power, and may even change its function, but it can be done immediately."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then continued to ask, "If I choose the second option, after repair, can it be restored to its current form?"</p><p>Gu Master was slightly stunned,  "That... is very difficult..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "Master just said that the treasure's spirit has vanished. Even if we do it perfectly, after repair it will at most be comparable to a spiritual treasure, and is highly likely to be only a pseudo-spiritual treasure. I don't lack pseudo-spiritual treasures. Therefore, the greatest use of this treasure is to verify Master's alchemic way and improve my alchemic skills."</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang decisively said, "Let's use Master's method first to repair the treasure, and then restore it to its original form. I believe this will be helpful for the next attempt."</p><p>"If you're willing to do so, I'll certainly accompany you," Gu Master had no objections. This proposal was the most advantageous for her; she hadn't expected Qin Sang to be so decisive.</p><p>Repairing a natural spiritual treasure would consume countless spiritual materials, which the average person couldn't afford.</p><p>Qin Sang, known for his decisiveness, took out the animal bones and other items he had accumulated from the Qianjun Ring, and said, "For this attempt, Master will personally handle it, and I'll be your assistant."  </p><p>He knew his own abilities best.</p><p>Repairing the spiritual treasure within two days, even with Master Gu's assistance, had less than a 10% chance of success.</p><p>Master Gu's expression shifted slightly.  She glanced at Qin Sang and stopped him from retrieving more treasures. "These are enough. My residence still has some resources, sufficient for this refinement. As for the next time, I've obtained some things; there are several necessary items that you should try to collect."</p><p>She listed several names, which Qin Sang carefully noted.</p><p>Subsequently, Qin Sang exceptionally stayed at Master Gu's residence for a full year, studying the art of crafting magical artifacts.</p><p>Master Gu had made prior preparations and acquired all the necessary materials within a year, incidentally gathering most of the items needed by Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Inside the furnace room,</p><p>the fire blazed brightly.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Master Gu seemed enveloped in a layer of red light.</p><p>The glaring red light illuminated Qin Sang's face. He intently watched Master Gu's every move, afraid of missing a single detail.</p><p>At this moment, Master Gu was employing a crafting technique he had never seen before. She first used her spiritual power to condense eight incense sticks, positioning them in the eight directions.</p><p>The incense sticks were lit, and the fragrant smoke gathered towards Master Gu's hands.</p><p>The fragrant smoke merged with the spiritual flames, causing a strange transformation. It seemed as if cloud dragons were circling and swimming around a broken drum.</p><p>With each hand seal she cast, the holes in the drum's surface gradually closed.</p><p>Master Gu, with the precision of a skilled craftswoman, meticulously wove over the holes, gradually repairing them.</p><p>Easy to say, but this step alone took ten days.</p><p>Finally, the drum's surface was completely repaired.</p><p>Master Gu suddenly opened her eyes, her gaze sharp and bright.  With a gesture, she summoned the spiritual drum from the flames; it was completely renewed!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The flames subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang flew to Master Gu's side, examining the spiritual drum. The drum's surface showed almost no trace of repair, emitting a luminescent, jade-like glow. The drum body was red, adorned with enigmatic patterns.</p><p>Master Gu raised her right hand, holding the drum in her palm, and slowly probed it with her spiritual sense. She did not find the "Treasure-passing Scripture," but the drum could be controlled normally.</p><p>As far as she knew, the spirit of a true treasure artifact had disappeared; there was no such thing as a Treasure-passing Scripture. Whether a postnatal spiritual treasure retains the Scripture depends on the relationship between the owner and the artifact's spirit—whether they trust each other.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently.</p><p>After a short while, the spiritual drum flew up on its own, transforming into a red light that soared into the air, becoming a giant drum several tens of meters in diameter.</p><p>The drum body vibrated.</p><p>No one struck it, yet a thunderous drumbeat emanated from within.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>The moment the drumbeat sounded,</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded violently. Despite his unwavering resolve, he felt a surge of blood rushing through him, a powerful battle intent rising from his heart.</p><p>Those with weaker willpower would likely be overwhelmed by the drumbeat, forgetting their own lives and recklessly charging into battle.</p><p>Next, Master Gu tested the drum's other spiritual abilities, all related to warfare.</p><p>The treasure's function was self-evident.</p><p>"Such a pity…"</p><p>Master Gu sighed.</p><p>Coming from a Daoist lineage, she instinctively considered the Daoist court. This war drum appearing on the battlefield would undoubtedly provide a powerful boost to their side.</p><p>If it were an intact postnatal spiritual treasure, this single treasure alone would increase the Daoist court's chances of victory by 10%!</p><p>Even restoring its power would make it a rare and invaluable treasure. Master Gu wanted to obtain it by any means.</p><p>Unfortunately, Master Gu confirmed that it was the life-bound treasure of some senior cultivator. Even if fully repaired, it would only function at the level of a top-grade magical artifact.</p><p>Regardless of its unique properties, a top-grade magical artifact could not change the outcome of a battle.</p><p>Of course, the war drum wasn't worthless.  One day, if she fully understood it, she might be able to replicate similar treasures.</p><p>Master Gu shook her head slightly and handed the drum to Qin Sang. "This is a war drum…"</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it, pondered it briefly, understood its function, and remained relatively calm.</p><p>The drum was a life-bound treasure, which he could keep for improving his artifact crafting skills. If it wasn't a life-bound treasure, it wouldn't be of much use to him. Giving it to the Daoist court through Master Gu should not disadvantage him.</p><p>Regardless, it was not a bad outcome for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was primarily interested in Master Gu's artifact crafting process; he had many questions and eagerly wanted to ask.</p><p>Master Gu, also eager to comprehend her recent gains, gave Qin Sang a concise explanation, then went into seclusion with the drum, leaving Qin Sang in the furnace room.</p><p>After Master Gu left, Qin Sang remained in the furnace room for many days, constantly refining something.</p><p>Finally, two fist-sized bone spheres floated before Qin Sang.</p><p>One sphere was black, and the other white—they were the transformed antlers of Xia Hou, refined into spiritual embryos after many days of work.</p><p>He decided to integrate the spheres into his gauntlets and re-refine the treasure, but not there.</p><p>Master Gu was in seclusion and could not be disturbed, so Qin Sang left a letter and departed from Baishi Town.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang hesitated, then remembered the other two items of the Qianjun Ring:  the Zhuoyu jade from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and the white chess piece obtained from the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang took out three other precious fragments for appraisal, keeping only these two, intending to study them himself.  For a hundred years, he'd made significant progress in the art of refinement, yet he still couldn't understand their origins.</p><p>As for the "Yin Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique," he knew he couldn't be distracted by it for the time being.</p><p>"Should I ask someone else for help?"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, then abandoned the idea.  The jade and the chess piece were both related to the "Yin Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique," linked to a certain Daoist tradition.  If that tradition was incompatible with this world and discovered by someone with ulterior motives, it would bring trouble.</p><p>After returning from Baishi Town, Qin Sang visited Master Qi.  Master Qi, already unkempt, now looked disheveled and haggard.  Aware of his dwindling time, he didn't dare waste a moment.</p><p>His disciples, understanding their master's dedication, wore sorrowful expressions.</p><p>Sensing the oppressive atmosphere in the house, Qin Sang sighed and, without announcing himself, pushed open the door.</p><p>Master Qi was startled awake, his bloodshot eyes clouded with confusion.</p><p>"Master, are you…delirious?" Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly, pulling Master Qi towards the doorway.</p><p>The bright sunlight gradually cleared his mind.</p><p>Master Qi fell silent for a long time, then murmured in a hoarse voice, "I only have ten years left to live!"</p><p>Qin Sang knew his aspirations but didn't know how to console him. He sighed, "My visit is to help you in any way I can, Master."</p><p>With a sweep of his sleeve, he cleared the debris from the furnace room and stored the remaining precious fragments in the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Seeing the fragments taken away, Master Qi nearly attacked him.</p><p>"Don't worry! Look at this!"</p><p>Qin Sang gestured again.</p><p>Two gauntlets, black and white bone spheres, and several orbs of varying sizes floated in mid-air.</p><p>Master Qi glanced at them, immediately captivated by the black and white bone spheres.  Despite their unknown origins, his keen eye recognized their extraordinary nature.</p><p>"I wish to refine these treasures anew, and I would like to ask for your assistance, Master. What do you think?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished, Master Qi eagerly nodded.</p><p>Seeing him staring intently at the spheres, Qin Sang smiled and placed them in his hands.</p><p>Master Qi, enamored with them, sat down on the spot and began analyzing them using a secret technique.  After a while, however, a worried expression crossed his face.  "This…I fear my skills are insufficient. I might ruin your painstaking work…"</p><p>He recognized the spheres' immense value, far exceeding any demonic bone he had ever seen.</p><p>Qin Sang shrugged.  "We'll refine them together. Even if we fail, it cannot be blamed solely on you."</p><p>Master Qi finally understood Qin Sang's intentions.  He took a deep breath, his lips moving as he bowed deeply to the ground.  "Thank you for your help!"</p><p>The two then sealed themselves in the furnace room for several months.</p><p>During those months, Qin Sang shared his insights and guided Master Qi in the art of refinement.  Essentially, he taught Master Qi what he'd recently learned from Master Gu, passing on whatever could be shared.  Once a student of Master Qi, their roles were now reversed, but Master Qi didn't mind, eagerly absorbing everything.</p><p>Finally, the day of the refining arrived.  Master Qi's face radiated confidence as he and Qin Sang sat on either side of the square cauldron.</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the fire as before, but this time he also participated in the refinement.  The two worked seamlessly together.</p><p>The two gauntlets flew into the cauldron.</p><p>Then, the black and white bone spheres and the other orbs were also added. Inside the cauldron, only a gray, amorphous mass remained, constantly shifting, its original form lost.</p><p>The spiritual fire blazed.</p><p>The atmosphere within the cauldron fluctuated constantly.  Qin Sang and Master Qi, both eyes closed, continuously cast hand seals into the cauldron.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the cauldron suddenly vibrated.  Master Qi, his face filled with excitement, struck the cauldron forcefully.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A crimson light shot out, instantly radiating an incredibly sharp aura.</p><p>The crimson light circled the void before being caught by Master Qi. After examining it, he laughed and threw it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang caught it, feeling an immediate blood connection, a wave of coolness rushing through his body, before the object vanished from his grasp.</p><p>Looking at his palm, Qin Sang was struck by an idea.  A crimson light flickered in his palm, silently forming a sharp blood spike.</p><p>A palm-sword, or perhaps a palm-spike!</p><p>Qin Sang's physical body was already incredibly strong, the gauntlets were merely an enhancement. After careful consideration, he decided to abandon the gauntlets and refine this unexpected weapon.</p><p>This treasure held another significance: it validated Qin Sang's previous accumulation in the art of refinement.</p><p>Both reaped considerable rewards from creating this treasure.</p><p>After staying on Star Island's Immortal Lake for several more months, Qin Sang returned to his cave, ready to explore the Poisonous Cave!</p><p>(End)</p>
