<h1>Chapter 890: True Disciple</h1><p>The Avatar visited the Dao Child, hoping to get closer to him and gain his favor for future endeavors.  Unexpectedly, the Dao Child offered to take him on as a true disciple.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>The Dao Child first sent a sound transmission talisman towards Jade Finger Peak, then flicked his sleeve and led the Avatar straight to the summit.</p><p>The Avatar remained cautious, suppressing his aura completely. No matter how much the Yin-Yang lineage had declined, there were bound to be plenty of Core Formation experts on the mountain.</p><p>Soon, the two arrived at a wooden pagoda on Yin-Yang Peak.</p><p>This pagoda was peculiar; it was built in the narrow passage between the twin peaks of Yin and Yang, supported only by a stone bridge, a precarious location.</p><p>The Dao Child pushed the door open.  Inside, it was empty.</p><p>Within the pagoda stood a several-meter-tall statue of a slender Daoist.</p><p>The Daoist's gaze was distant, his bearing extraordinary.</p><p>The statue was clearly made of some kind of spiritual wood, enhanced with restrictions. Despite standing there for who knew how many years, its surface remained smooth and pristine.</p><p>“This is the ancestor of our Yin-Yang lineage, Daoist Yin-Yang.”</p><p>The Dao Child, his back to the Avatar, lit a stick of incense and bowed respectfully to the statue.</p><p>“Disciple pays respects to Ancestor!”</p><p>The Avatar's heart trembled as he knelt.</p><p>Daoist Yin-Yang had been a renowned Nascent Soul expert in the Canglang Sea and the founder of the Yin-Yang lineage of the Barrier Struggle Sect.</p><p>“Master is not at the sect now, but he instructed me to handle your matters. Now, make a Heart Devil Oath, and I will pass on the first level of the 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art' to you.  When Master returns, I will report to him…”</p><p>Only the first level? The Avatar felt disappointed but followed the instructions and made the oath.</p><p>The Dao Child flicked a streak of light from his fingertip into the Avatar's forehead.</p><p>The Avatar's body trembled slightly.  Then, a section of scripture appeared in his mind. As the Dao Child had said, it was only the first level of the 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art,' the Qi Refining level.</p><p>“Don't underestimate this foundational first level. This is the essence of the entire cultivation method.  Our ancestor comprehended the true meaning of the Yin-Yang Dao based on this method, and his might shook the Canglang Sea…”</p><p>The Dao Child's expression was solemn as he recounted the ancestor's deeds.</p><p>Hearing this, the Avatar thought that his judgment had indeed been sound.  The ancient scroll of the 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art' was only the first level; the subsequent levels were actually created by Daoist Yin-Yang himself.</p><p>This astonished the Avatar.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu, with his exceptional talent, was able to create his own killing talismans because the 'Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture' had five levels, allowing him to cultivate to the Core Formation stage.</p><p>The 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art' had only the first level remaining, making it extremely incomplete. Could Daoist Yin-Yang have started creating his own cultivation method from the Foundation Establishment stage?</p><p>“Perhaps Daoist Yin-Yang initially cultivated the Yin-Yang Dao, and after achieving a certain level, he discovered the 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art,' which allowed him to comprehend its true meaning and gradually create the subsequent levels. It's impossible for someone to be that extraordinary. Even so, he was incredibly powerful.  His talent must have been comparable to Senior Qingzhu's.”</p><p>The Avatar memorized the cultivation method, listening to the Dao Child's explanation while these thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p>“After you return, go to Senior Brother Lu to exchange your jade slip. When Master returns, he will make arrangements for you. From now on, you will cultivate the 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art.' Strive to cultivate the first wisp of Yin-Yang Qi in your dantian as soon as possible. When the Bright Island Conference begins in two months, you can also go and gain some experience…”</p><p>The Dao Child continued.</p><p>“Uncle Yang, what is the Bright Island Conference?” The Avatar asked curiously.</p><p>The Dao Child glanced at him. “I forgot. The conference has nothing to do with outer disciples, so it's normal that you haven't heard of it.  This conference is actually a competition between the true disciples of our Barrier Struggle Sect and some nearby sects.  It's held on Bright Island, hence the name Bright Island Conference. Bright Island is a secret island outside of Barrier Struggle Island. It only opens during the conference.”</p><p>The Avatar gasped.  “The true disciples of the various sects are all Foundation Establishment experts like Uncle Yang. If I participate, I’ll only be at the bottom, right?”</p><p>“Do you actually want to win first place?”</p><p>The Dao Child scoffed. “The requirements for true disciples in other smaller sects are not as strict as ours.  There are plenty of Qi Refining disciples participating. You don't need to think about competing for a good ranking, just focus on demonstrating your true strength and treat it as a training opportunity.  Besides, the rewards at the conference are quite good, which will benefit your future cultivation. If not for this rare opportunity, there wouldn't be such a rush for you to become a true disciple.”</p><p>“Disciple understands and will cultivate diligently.”</p><p>The Avatar said this, but he wasn't interested in the conference.</p><p>He hadn't participated in the Eight Sects Grand Competition in the Small Cold Realm before, and he certainly wasn't interested now. No matter how good the rewards were, they wouldn't catch his eye.</p><p>But he couldn't refuse the Dao Child's request either. He planned to just go through the motions when the time came.</p><p>However, the secret island, Bright Island, piqued his interest. He wondered if it had anything to do with Fighting Ox Peak.</p><p>Secret grounds, forbidden areas…</p><p>On second thought, the Avatar dismissed the idea.</p><p>Bright Island wasn't solely occupied by the Barrier Struggle Sect. When the conference started, sects near the Barrier Struggle Sect would gather there.  How could a lineage establish its true inheritance in such a place?</p><p>After another hour of tedious procedures, the Avatar finally flew out of Yin-Yang Peak and returned to Jade Finger Peak to exchange his jade slip.</p><p>"Becoming a true disciple was even faster than expected. The Avatar can't cultivate the 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art.' Even if he uses the main body to create a disguise, in front of a Core Formation cultivator like Elder Huayang, who is proficient in this method, it will definitely be exposed sooner or later. He can only pretend to be inept, unable to cultivate Yin-Yang Qi, and stall for time to gather information as quickly as possible…"</p><p>As a true disciple, the Avatar could move around much more freely than before.  Places forbidden to outer disciples were accessible to him.</p><p>He didn't rush to leave Jin Yan's stone hall. Utilizing his dual identities, he successfully infiltrated several hidden locations, secretly using the Sky Eye Butterfly to observe while investigating from multiple angles.</p><p>Before he knew it, the Bright Island Conference was approaching.</p><p>The Dao Child became even more attentive to him, but the Avatar’s continued failure to cultivate Yin-Yang Qi left him exasperated, even starting to doubt his own judgment.</p><p>After another harsh reprimand, the Avatar returned to his cave dwelling to find two figures standing at the entrance. One of them was Fang Ting.</p><p>Fang Ting had been visiting frequently. Her background within the Barrier Struggle Sect was no secret. The Dao Child had even reminded the Avatar not to neglect her because of the incident that day.</p><p>Since it didn't interfere with his main objective and Fang Ting's identity might prove useful, the Avatar had been patiently dealing with her.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a month ago, Fang Ting brought another person along: Zhao Songqiao, who had participated in the Smoke and Mist Pavilion's disciple recruitment ceremony with them.</p><p>"Senior Brother Zhang!"</p><p>Fang Ting waved happily upon seeing him.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao's old face creased into a smile as he bowed. "This older brother has been craving Senior Brother Zhang's spiritual tea and has come to impose again."</p>
