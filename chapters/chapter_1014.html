<h1>Chapter 1006: Return</h1><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his aura.</p><p>The white crane never expected to encounter a cultivator here, and one that seemed hostile at that.</p><p>Its eyes darted around, then it turned and fled.</p><p>Indeed, it was quite intelligent.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded with satisfaction.  Three-colored遁光 (escape light) flashed from his body, easily intercepting the crane's path.</p><p>The white crane darted left and right, but each time Qin Sang easily blocked its way.</p><p>Unable to break through, the white crane grew enraged, flapping its wings and attacking Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang threw a punch, meeting the crane's wing blow head-on.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang only staggered slightly, while the white crane was sent flying backward, its wings trembling, its eyes filled with shock.</p><p>The white crane felt a surge of fear.  It dared not continue the struggle.  With a tremor of its wings, it launched two blade-like beams of light, then transformed into a white streak, fleeing in panic.</p><p>Qin Sang moved in a blur, easily dodging the light blades.</p><p>This time, he didn't rush to intercept the crane.  Instead, he calmly pursued it, summoning his ebony sword and leisurely cutting out a sword strike now and then.</p><p>This chase was pure toying.</p><p>Even without using his sword wheel, a casual strike was enough to keep the crane on the defensive.</p><p>It finally understood that the cultivator's strength was unfathomable, and his speed far surpassed its own; it was utterly impossible to escape.</p><p>If Qin Sang wanted it to go east, it couldn't go west.</p><p>From rage to despair.</p><p>Finally, after an unknown distance, the crane completely gave up, its wings folding as it plummeted into the sea, floating motionless on the surface.</p><p>It seemed to have surrendered, leaving itself entirely at Qin Sang's mercy.</p><p>"Playing dead, are we?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, flying to its side.  He saw the crane's eyes closed, with no reaction whatsoever.</p><p>This puzzled Qin Sang.</p><p>He summoned the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, pointing a finger at the crane.  The ring flew towards the crane's head.  He had emptied the ring when he decided to subdue the crane.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true energy, the artifact's light blazing, ring-shaped shadows surging towards the crane. Under the rings' restraint, the crane's body stiffened.</p><p>Subduing the crane wasn't difficult for someone of Qin Sang's cultivation, but a process of taming was still needed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when Qin Sang attempted to use the artifact to subdue it, he encountered no resistance whatsoever. The crane had truly resigned itself to fate, abandoning all resistance, allowing Qin Sang to do as he pleased.</p><p>Qin Sang had never encountered such a compliant spirit beast before. He'd intended to use the artifact to give it a lesson, but given the crane's cooperation, he felt he couldn't bring himself to do it.</p><p>The crane flipped over, extending its claws to touch the neck ring, its eyes darting around.</p><p>"You seem rather clever. Follow me. As long as you obey my commands and work diligently, you won't suffer. And in the future, your release isn't impossible…"</p><p>Qin Sang observed the crane.</p><p>This fellow certainly understood, its intelligence no less than that of the two-headed… (creature).</p><p>However, the crane's nature was too slippery. Unlike the two-headed…, it couldn't be motivated simply by empty promises. He would need to find opportunities to discipline it later.</p><p>"Take me to find a late-stage妖丹 (demon core) demon beast nearby," Qin Sang commanded.</p><p>The crane, which had been hanging its head in dejection, suddenly perked up at this command.  It seemed to forget its predicament, its eyes shining brightly as it let out two excited squawks, eager to fly back.</p><p>Seeing the crane's excited state, Qin Sang looked at it strangely.  Had he accidentally captured a fool?</p><p>Then he guessed at the crane's ulterior motive—it intended to take the opportunity to settle the score with a rival.</p><p>That demon island wasn't simple; Qin Sang suspected that a transformed demon beast's lair might lie deep within.  He didn't want to fight on the island and attract powerful enemies, so he immediately stopped the crane.</p><p>The crane was quite disappointed.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang felt he'd stayed too long and it was getting dangerous, so he decided to leave this sea area.</p><p>The white crane cast a wistful gaze back, taking three steps and then looking back, its cries mournful, as if bidding farewell to its… partners.</p><p>…</p><p>Under the guise of training, it was actually more like wandering.</p><p>Qin Sang journeyed across the Demon Sea for countless miles, experiencing diverse landscapes and encountering several perilous situations, even alarming transformed demon beasts who laid traps to ambush him.</p><p>Thankfully, Qin Sang was vigilant enough to escape far away.</p><p>His gains were also quite substantial.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the ten-year agreement was fast approaching.</p><p>On a nameless islet.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from meditation, inspecting his body.</p><p>Nearly ten years of training. Because he didn't dare stay in one place, besides the uninterrupted 引星元炼体 (star essence body refinement) every day, he didn't have much time for real cultivation. However, his understanding of the killing talisman had deepened another level, and it would be easy for him to catch up in his cultivation in the future.</p><p>The appointed time is near.  The Seven Kills Hall is about to appear. I wonder how Bai is doing. It's time to return…</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated the time, muttering to himself.</p><p>He had spent ten years in the Demon Sea, accumulating a considerable fortune.  Only a Nascent Soul stage demon would warrant his personal intervention; demon cores and corpses were extremely valuable.</p><p>"Time for a major shopping spree on Tianxing Island…"</p><p>Qin Sang decided to return to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>He took out a poisonous algae fruit and fed it to the fat silkworm.  Then, he took out a petal from a surprisingly discovered spirit flower, watching as the Tianmu butterfly delicately consumed it. His expression softened.</p><p>Both spirit insects remained in the mid-third transformation stage.</p><p>The fat silkworm, despite consuming numerous poisonous algae fruits, showed no signs of breaking through. The Tianmu butterfly was also far from breaking through; it was impossible before entering the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>After feeding his spirit insects, Qin Sang left his cave dwelling.  Bai He was nowhere to be seen, so he activated the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>Shortly after, a white light streaked across the sea in the distance—Bai He.</p><p>Bai He flew swiftly, landing beside Qin Sang. He looked around excitedly, preening his feathers, scattering a few red ones.</p><p>"Where have you been again?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He scolded, "If you cause any more trouble, don't expect me to clean up after you!"</p><p>Initially, Bai He had been lazy, but after several harsh lessons, he had become somewhat more compliant, though his womanizing remained unchanged.</p><p>Bai He shrunk his neck, looking meek.</p><p>A moment later, a white light flew from the small island.</p><p>Qin Sang rode Bai He across the Demon Sea, returning to the Great Waste Island.</p><p>Ten years had passed, but the Great Waste Island and Tianxing Island remained largely unchanged. Qin Sang contacted various trading houses and auction houses, selling off unnecessary spiritual materials and exchanging them for a large quantity of rare treasures from the Xiao Han region, such as demon-slaying pills.</p><p>Being a cultivator, Qin Sang felt no shame in engaging in such speculation.</p><p>However, he didn't spend too much time on it; he knew when to stop.</p><p>Whether he could return or not remained uncertain.</p><p>While making his purchases, Qin Sang also gathered treasures useful to him, preparing for his entry into the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>After over a month of busy activity, he finally finished his errands and left Tianxing Island.</p><p>This time, he didn't know if he would ever return.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, looking back at Tianxing Island, lost in thought.</p><p>"The Wang sisters, Yuan Zhu…"</p><p>Qin Sang counted, realizing there weren't many people or things here worth remembering.</p><p>He had said goodbye to the Wang sisters and Yuan Zhu.  The whereabouts of the two-headed… creature remained unknown.</p><p>It was only pitiful for the mute woman; even if she awakened, it would be difficult for her to return to her hometown.</p>
