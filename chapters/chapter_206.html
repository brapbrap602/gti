Chapter 199: Refuge

The ark silently appeared inside a huge hall.

The hall was thirty meters high, looking very simple in design. Several huge stone pillars, unpolished with lots of pits and hollows, supported the ceiling. There was no other decoration in the hall, except a dark passage at the back leading who knows where.

As soon as the ark appeared, a team of ten guards rushed over. They were all wearing the same uniform armor with runes on it. It was a defensive magic weapon of decent power.

Each guard had a token hanging from their waists, though they were of different designs. The leader of the team was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, whose token indicated his rank as a captain.

The ark shook slightly, letting out the people inside, and then it was grasped by Che Yutao and vanished.

The huge hall was filled with so many people, yet it still looked incredibly empty.

The captain of the guards hurried to Che Yutao and bowed respectfully. "Yuyangzi, the warden of Xuanguan Pass, offers his respect to Uncle-Master Che!"

Che Yutao responded with an "Hm" and said, "You have the duty of arranging accommodations for these people."

He disappeared without a trace before he could finish speaking.

Yuyangzi quickly responded in affirmation. He turned around to face everyone. His look was stern, but it softened and he nodded slightly to Qin Sang and other Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"My Dao name is Yuyangzi. I'm the warden of Xuanguan Pass. My fellow Daoist friends, this is your first visit. There are several rules you have to remember. Number one, enter and exit only through the gates. You are not allowed to trespass the City Walls or destroy the barriers without permission, or you will be killed on sight! Number two, no matter where you are, do not obstruct the Guards..."

Yuyangzi's tone was full of killing intent, as if to warn everyone not to take the rules of Xuanguan Pass lightly. He then introduced other matters that should be heeded and finished off by saying, "Guji!"

"Yes!"

A guard answered and stepped forth.

"Fellow Daoists of different clans," Yuyangzi looked around, "those who wish to join the Xuanguan Guards, please step forward. Guji will lead you to the barracks for a qualification test. The rest of you, please feel free..."

The Xuanguan Guards were the guards of Xuanguan Pass.

As he spoke, Yuyangzi pointed out of the hall.

A brief commotion ensued among the crowd. The members of different clans separated themselves, and only a small portion of them were willing to join the Xuanguan Guards. The rest left together.

After Guji led that group away, only the core disciples of Mount Shaohua remained. Yuyangzi's expression and tone were a lot more amiable now.

"Fellow Daoists, this is your first visit to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and you may not be familiar with it. The jade slips contain anything you want to know, including a map of Xuanguan Pass and part of the map of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Please don't damage the jade slips, or you won't be able to take a single step on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield without them..."

He reached for his mustard bag and countless jade slips flew out.

Qin Sang grabbed one with his spiritual power and used his Divine Sense to examine it. The jade slip contained quite a lot of information. He only skimmed through the first few lines before he heard Yuyangzi continue, "The most important part in the jade slip for you is its last part, a map of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Most of the refuges are marked on the map. Fellow Daoists, if you ever enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield alone, when the celestial phenomena strike or when you are chased by cloud beasts, you must find a refuge in advance. It is the most important thing you need to do. If you are on your own without a barrier and get caught up in the celestial phenomena, you will be injured at the least, or dead at the worst."

Qin Sang glanced at the end of the jade slip, and he saw small and large dots of light marking different locations on the map.

The map covered a large area, but in fact, the only areas marked in detail were the outermost and outer rings of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

The map divided the Ancient Immortal Battlefield into greater detail than the one Qin Sang got before.

The heart of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, where space cracks were concentrated, was believed to be the main battlefield of the ancient immortal cultivators. It was not only full of danger, but also home to many powerful cloud beasts. Rarely anyone dared to go there.

Outside the core, the space cracks became sparser, but it was still extremely dangerous. Even Golden Core cultivators had to proceed with caution and fear. No sect was powerful enough to control the area.

The outer ring of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was where different sects competed.

The outer ring was further divided into four layers: the inner, the middle, the outer, and the outermost rings.

The dots of light represented the locations of the refuges. The larger the dot, the larger the town or the trade center built there on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

These towns and street markets were basically transformed from the explored secret abodes, relying on the restrictions in the secret abodes, to resist weather changes and Yun Beast attacks, these could be found in the four level regions of the ancient immortal battlefield. It is less common as you go further in, but they are the safest destinations in the ancient immortal battlefield.
It is with the help of these locations that immortal cultivators do not have to worry about their way back.
Those small light points are small safe houses spontaneously built by monks who entered the ancient immortal battlefield, some were hidden deep underground, while some used terrain, most of them are in the external regions.
There is an unwritten rule in the ancient immortal battlefield, everyone who enters the shelter will leave a few restrictions, overtime the shelters will become stronger, when weather changes come, passersby can go in there to avoid danger.
The strengths of these shelters are far less than secret abodes, in case the weather changes are too fierce, or unfortunately discovered by a powerful Yun Beast, the shelter cannot guarantee safety.
Luckily, this rarely happens in the external region.
After countless years of exploration, the dangerous zones of the external region have been mostly understood, the large sects rely on the large cities, controlling this area, dividing their influence, and sect disciples are not allowed to cross borders.
Now this control is slowly spreading to the external region.
Yu Yang Zi was right, without the map, you would find it difficult in the ancient immortal battlefield, similar maps are also sold outside, but you have to pay for them, and they are far less detailed than Shao Hua Shan.
When they finished reading the jade slip, Yu Yang Zi opened his mouth, "Which fellow daoist would like to join the Xuangu Wei or Ying Wei, you can step forward, Qi training disciples can only be normal guards, fellow daoist in the foundation building period and I can be guards. If you want to join the Ying Wei, Qi training disciples need to go through a test."
He meant the foundation building disciples can choose freely.
Actually, based on the information on the jade slip, they have more options than Xuangu Wei and Ying Wei, for example, guarding the sect controlled secret abode, not only will it be easier, but you can also get a share of the secret abode.
However, the requirements are much higher, Qin Sang guesses that one would need background to qualify.
At that moment, Qin Sang heard Yu Daiyue's voice transmission, "Fellow daoist Qin, I will be leaving first."
Qin Sang turned, and saw Yu Daiyue nod at him, then turned and walked out of the hall, not a few fellow members left with him, it seems like senior daoist Yu has made up his mind to rush into the ancient immortal battlefield alone.
