<h1>Chapter 1699: Baichuan Market</h1><p>Baichuan Market.</p><p>The origin of this name has two explanations.</p><p>The first pertains to the surrounding terrain.  Situated on the eastern coast of the Northern Wastelands, near a confluence of waterways, it resembles a hundred rivers converging and flowing into the Eastern Sea.</p><p>The second explanation attributes the name to the market’s founder, known as Patriarch Baichuan.</p><p>The coast of the Eastern Sea is the most prosperous region of the Northern Wastelands. More than half of the Northern Wastelands’ Demonic Sects have established their bases here. Compared to other areas in the Northern Wastelands, it is relatively peaceful. While it doesn’t match the Central Plains, where cultivators are bound by strict rules, the major Demonic Sects here have established certain conventions and laws, generally refraining from reckless actions.</p><p>However, in a realm dominated by Demonic Sects, there is never a shortage of those who break the rules.</p><p>Therefore, even on the coast of the Eastern Sea, places that can guarantee safety and facilitate secure transactions are rare. Baichuan Market is one such place.</p><p>The master of Baichuan Market has the audacity to establish rules, and also the power to enforce them.</p><p>Choosing Baichuan Market for the transaction also carries a deeper meaning.</p><p>Rumor has it that Baichuan Market has close ties with the Golden Jade Gate. Some even claim that the power controlling Baichuan Market is actually composed of Golden Jade Gate disciples, acting as two sides of the same coin.</p><p>The Golden Jade Gate’s wealth is unmatched, precisely because it can operate within the Eastern Sea, the Northern Wastelands, and the Central Plains, benefiting from all sides.</p><p>Mo Xingdao hailed from the Northern Wastelands, and Qin Sang also needed to guard against him colluding with Demonic Sects and harboring ill intentions. Baichuan Market was a place acceptable to both parties.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang wasn't being hunted by the Saint King yet. His caution was simply habitual.</p><p>If he hadn't been injured, with both his true body and avatar present, he wouldn't have feared Mo Xingdao's treachery, unless Mo Xingdao rallied all the Northern Wastelands’ Demonic Sects to hunt him down.</p><p>With a hundred rivers converging, the waterways naturally teemed with boats.</p><p>Many cultivators even occupied the waterways near Baichuan Market, using spirit arrays to seal off sections of water to create flying boats, which they parked on the river surface as their cave dwellings.</p><p>Similar cave dwellings were also available for rent.</p><p>Inside an ordinary-looking flying boat, a Nether Moon Guard sat in meditation within the cabin.</p><p>Suddenly, the Nether Moon Guard's eyelids twitched.  He roused from his meditative state and flipped his right hand, revealing a small jade seal in his palm, a type of talisman used for communication.</p><p>The talisman glowed faintly, noticeable in the dim cabin. The jade bead at the top emitted a rhythmic halo.</p><p>Seeing this, the Nether Moon Guard's expression tightened.</p><p>He addressed the jade bead respectfully, “Greetings, Master!”</p><p>“Is Mo Xingdao still in his cave dwelling?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s avatar’s voice transmitted from the talisman.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's avatar had already arrived near Baichuan Market, but remained hidden.</p><p>A few days ago, Qin Sang received news that Mo Xingdao had appeared in Baichuan Market. He ordered his subordinates to secretly monitor Mo Xingdao's movements. The Nether Moon Guards were only at the early Nascent Soul stage. Even if they all mobilized, they wouldn't be able to track Mo Xingdao and would only be courting death. Qin Sang hadn’t held out much hope, only instructing them to gather information.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mo Xingdao showed no intention of concealing himself. He left the pre-arranged mark and rented a cave dwelling in the West Market of Baichuan Market. He hadn't left since, seemingly waiting for Qin Sang to arrive.</p><p>Of course, whether Mo Xingdao was truly present, or if he was, like Qin Sang, employing a deceptive tactic, no one knew. The Nether Moon Guards didn't dare to enter and investigate.</p><p>“He hasn’t been seen leaving.”</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard replied.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang’s avatar pondered, gazing towards Baichuan Market.</p><p>This time, only his avatar had come. His true body was severely injured, and even if he rushed over, he wouldn't be able to contribute much. In case of unforeseen circumstances, the avatar could take the brunt of the danger, preventing harm to his true body.</p><p>After a moment, the avatar spoke into the talisman. The Nether Moon Guard on the other end respectfully acknowledged, but after the connection was severed, his brow furrowed, feeling somewhat uneasy.</p><p>However, he was controlled by the Nether Moon Seal, his life and death in another’s hands. He didn't dare to resist.</p><p>Fortunately, the new master didn't seem as capricious and cruel as Su Zinan. He had been given a treasure beforehand, already refined and ready to use.</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard opened his spatial pouch and retrieved a mirror. It was the fully restored Thousand Worlds Mirror.</p><p>He gently touched the mirror's surface, spiritual energy swirling in his palm.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The mirror surface brightened, emitting a strong light.</p><p>Strangely, the beam of light seemed to encounter an invisible barrier in the void and abruptly stopped. As the light fluctuated in intensity, a mirror image of the Thousand Worlds Mirror gradually formed in the void.</p><p>The mirror image only existed for a fleeting moment before vanishing.</p><p>Leaving the mirror image here and scattering invisible mirror marks along the way would allow for an easy escape back to the flying boat in case of danger. The Thousand Worlds Mirror was undoubtedly a treasure for escape, its drawback being the need for prior preparation and distance limitations.</p><p>The mirror image coalesced.</p><p>Concerned for his own safety, the Nether Moon Guard carefully checked again, confirming everything was in order.  He then left the flying boat alone, boarded a ferry, and sailed into Baichuan Market.</p><p>Canals crisscrossed within the city.  A spirit lake occupied the city center, with the East, South, West, and North Markets built around it, resembling a city on water.</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard was, after all, a Nascent Soul Grandmaster. No petty thief dared to trouble him. He smoothly entered the city, proceeded to the West Market, and arrived in front of Mo Xingdao's cave dwelling.</p><p>He touched the restrictive barrier.</p><p>Soon, the cave dwelling opened, and a figure emerged.</p><p>This person was dressed as a scholar, his appearance and physique vastly different from Mo Xingdao.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you are…"</p><p>The scholar narrowed his eyes, his face questioning.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the Nether Moon Guard's blood qi condensed between his eyebrows, revealing the Nether Moon Seal.</p><p>The scholar smiled faintly. His form and features twisted and shifted, revealing his true face. It was indeed Mo Xingdao's true body!</p><p>He had disguised himself when leaving the mark. If he had appeared with his true face, news of the Northern Wastelands’ number one rogue cultivator entering the city would have caused panic throughout Baichuan Market.</p><p>He had traveled with Su Zinan for a time, but hadn't met all the Nether Moon Guards.</p><p>Seeing the Nether Moon Seal, he confirmed the other party’s identity.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, please enter. May I inquire as to your Daoist title?”</p><p>Mo Xingdao gestured invitingly, quite courteous, not treating the Nether Moon Guard poorly because of his status.</p><p>“A mere servant, I have no face to use my former title.”</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard's expression remained indifferent.</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded, not taking offense. He asked, “Is Fellow Daoist Qingfeng well?”</p><p>Having witnessed Su Zinan's nascent soul being captured, he knew that Lu Ye and the Nether Moon Guards must have fallen into Qin Sang’s avatar’s hands.  Qin Sang’s avatar, known as Daoist Qingfeng, had become widely known after the Xie family went to Ganlu Monastery to cry for justice, along with the news of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>“I am here on Master’s orders.”</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard adhered to his duty, not saying a word more. He immediately took out the communication talisman and informed the avatar of the situation, then withdrew from the cave dwelling.</p><p>The talisman transmitted the avatar's somewhat muffled voice, "Fellow Daoist Mo."</p><p>Mo Xingdao's response was unexpected, "Fellow Daoist Qin is late. You've kept me waiting."</p><p>Silence followed for a while before the avatar finally spoke, "Fellow Daoist already knows."</p><p>“The Saint King’s treachery couldn't be hidden from discerning eyes. I am not the only one who feels injustice on your behalf, Fellow Daoist Qin. It’s just a pity our voices are too small,” Mo Xingdao said gravely.</p><p>The avatar sighed softly, “I appreciate Fellow Daoist Mo’s concern. I’m sure Fellow Daoist is aware of my current predicament. I had no choice but to contact you in this manner. I hope you will not take offense.”</p><p>Mo Xingdao uttered a word of understanding, then glanced outside the cave dwelling, asking doubtfully, “Surely Fellow Daoist Qin wouldn’t entrust the Five Elements Pellet to a Nether Moon Guard?  I've already brought the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit. I’m curious about the meaning behind Fellow Daoist’s actions. Is our previous agreement still valid? Or has the method of exchange changed?”</p><p>As for himself, his presence here already demonstrated his stance.</p><p>The avatar didn't answer, instead saying, “I, like Fellow Daoist Mo, operate alone, with no one to assist me.  Forced by the Saint King, I managed to escape, but suffered severe injuries that shook my foundation.  My true body is gravely wounded and has yet to recover. My avatar’s cultivation is insufficient and cannot act independently.”</p><p>Mo Xingdao listened silently, not interrupting.</p><p>“It is not that I distrust Fellow Daoist Mo, but both spiritual medicines are crucial, and I am now a thorn in the Saint King's side, like a startled bird. Even at my peak, I wouldn’t dare to be careless.”</p><p>Having explained his situation, the avatar finally stated, "I initiated the trade, and naturally, I won't go back on my word."</p><p>Mo Xingdao seemed to understand. "Fellow Daoist Qin means…"</p><p>"Both the Five Elements Pellet and the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit are to be consumed at the moment of breakthrough. For both of us, they aren’t urgently needed...  Fellow Daoist’s cultivation hasn't reached its peak yet, has it?"</p><p>The avatar suddenly countered.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's expression flickered slightly, but he didn't answer.</p><p>However, their realms were comparable. They had even clashed before. Although Qin Sang couldn't see through Mo Xingdao's depths, he could make a basic judgment based on certain signs.</p><p>The avatar proposed, "Since it's not urgent, could Fellow Daoist accommodate me for a while? Once the situation calms down and my true body recovers, we can arrange the exchange then. How does that sound?"</p><p>Being targeted by the Saint King Fox allowed Qin Sang no room for carelessness.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was able to bring out the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit, but who knew what price he had paid?  Yet, he had stayed in the Ghost Rock Plateau for so long. How could Qin Sang not be suspicious?</p><p>Even with a Nascent Soul threat, the avatar facing Mo Xingdao and his puppet alone seemed too vulnerable.</p><p>When it concerned his life, no amount of caution was excessive.</p><p>Qin Sang sought to delay, at least until his true body refined the Demonic Fire Origin and had the power to fight a Nascent Soul cultivator, before considering the exchange.</p><p>Not to mention the benefits from the greatly enhanced divine sense.</p><p>Based on the performance of the two Nascent Soul cultivators in the battle against the Demonic Lord, Qin Sang estimated that once he refined the Demonic Fire Origin, the Fire Lotus would also possess Nascent Soul level power.  And since he controlled the Fire Lotus as if it were an extension of his own body, the consumption would be far less than that of the six firebirds.</p><p>This wouldn't take too long.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's puppet was proficient in Yin-Yang Escape techniques, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, with fewer concerns than him.</p><p>To persuade Mo Xingdao, Qin Sang appealed to both reason and emotion, and dispatched the Nether Moon Guard to show his sincerity.</p><p>Tacitly, neither mentioned their cooperation and exchange after the Six Continents Hall treasure exchange, but both were aware of the other’s identity. That transaction had been relatively smooth, laying a good foundation.</p><p>They were now, in a sense, safeguarding the spiritual medicines for each other.</p><p>If Mo Xingdao disregarded everything else and insisted on trading now, Qin Sang would have to carefully consider his intentions.</p><p>Mo Xingdao neither agreed nor refused, remaining silent for a moment before saying, "I have two purposes for coming here.  One is to honor our agreement, and the other is to relay a message."</p><p>On the other side of the talisman, the avatar’s eyes suddenly narrowed, his entire body tensing.</p><p>Even through the talisman, Mo Xingdao seemed to sense the avatar’s tension.</p><p>He spoke calmly, "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. I've come on the orders of the Saint Huiguang.  Before I left, the Saint gave me a grain of sand, instructing me to open the restriction within the sand upon contacting Fellow Daoist Qin. He has an important matter to discuss with you, concerning the Saint King Fox, your grievance, the Xie family, and your future predicament. As a gesture of goodwill, the Saint's true body remains in the Central Plains. If Fellow Daoist Qin doesn't mind, I shall open the grain of sand now."</p><p>Silence hung in the air for a long while.</p><p>The avatar, certain that the other party couldn't track him through the talisman, still added a layer of concealment restrictions around himself.</p><p>If not for the limitations on the transmission distance, he would have retreated further.</p><p>What was Saint Huiguang’s purpose in stepping in?</p><p>Could it be because of the Xie family's plea for justice, unable to silence the rumors and feeling the pressure?</p><p>Could Saint Huiguang shield him from the Saint King Fox?</p><p>The other party certainly possessed the strength, but Qin Sang couldn't fathom his reasons for doing so.</p><p>Since Mo Xingdao had been sent to relay the message, Saint Huiguang must be aware of the trade.  If this matter wasn’t handled well, the trade might encounter further complications.</p><p>The avatar said in a deep voice, "Please proceed, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Only then did Mo Xingdao retrieve a grain of yellow sand from his spatial pouch.</p><p>The seemingly ordinary grain of sand, after Mo Xingdao injected a series of hand seals, suddenly expanded, transforming into countless motes of dust.</p><p>The Buddhist saying, "One grain of sand, one world," was precisely like this scene.</p><p>The motes of dust hovered within the cave dwelling, dyeing the entire space a dusky yellow. Faint sounds of wind and sand arose, then the silhouettes of two figures appeared within the dust.</p><p>The figures were blurry, composed of yellow sand, but one could discern an old monk and a woman.</p><p>Saint Huiguang had actually used this sand treasure and great divine power to transmit his thoughts all the way from the Central Plains.</p><p>The sandy image of the old monk’s eyes looked dull. Facing the talisman, his lips moved, his voice as deep as Saint Huiguang’s, “Is this Benefactor Qin?”</p><p>After a moment, the avatar replied, “Greetings, Saint.”</p><p>Having confirmed the identity, Saint Huiguang’s speech suddenly quickened, “This thought transmission technique cannot be maintained for long. I’ll get straight to the point.  It is said that grievances are best resolved, not harbored. I wish to mediate and resolve the conflict between Benefactor Qin and the Saint King Fox. What are your thoughts, Benefactor Qin?”</p><p>The avatar on the other end was stunned.</p><p>He hadn't expected Saint Huiguang to actually intervene and take the initiative in such a matter.</p><p>Could the righteous path of the Central Plains truly uphold justice?</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, the avatar said coldly, "What conflict? It's just me being unilaterally hunted by the Saint King, right?  Whether those two crocodile demons are disciples of the Saint King or not is clear to everyone. Let’s not resort to these deceptive tricks to fool the world!"</p><p>The illusory image of the Saint King Fox remained silent.</p><p>Saint Huiguang’s tone remained steady as he stated the truth, “I’ve inquired thoroughly. The Saint King Fox acted against you because she was attracted to a treasure on your person, compounded by past grievances.  I know this justification is weak and untenable.  But having cultivated to this realm, such matters are commonplace, and we understand deeply that there are no irreconcilable grudges. If this knot can be untied, you wouldn't have to be so cautious and could be relieved of this burden, wouldn’t you?  Therefore, I believe there is a possibility for resolution.”</p><p>Whether it was because the secret technique truly couldn't be maintained for long, Saint Huiguang's words were unusually straightforward.</p><p>The other party’s frankness left the avatar somewhat speechless.</p><p>Without waiting for the avatar to respond, Saint Huiguang continued, “The Saint King Fox sincerely repents and is willing to compensate you for your losses, and swear an oath to never actively harm you again. I am willing to bear witness!”</p>
