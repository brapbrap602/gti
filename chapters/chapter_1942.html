<h1>Chapter 1933: Yulang</h1><p>Vermilion Bird, having spotted something novel, danced with excitement.</p><p>Little Five lowered her head, following Vermilion Bird's gaze.</p><p>Below the precipice was a lush jungle.</p><p>Ancient trees towered skyward, their crowns forming a dense, impenetrable canopy. Occasionally, thick, python-like vines could be seen dangling down.</p><p>‘Chirp… Chirp…’</p><p>‘Tweet… Tweet…’</p><p>‘Flutter!’</p><p>This was a paradise for birds. Nests were visible everywhere in the canopy, and rustling sounds frequently emanated from below, indicating beasts running through the undergrowth.</p><p>However, the roars of ferocious beasts were almost nonexistent here.  Predators like jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards were likely rare.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, traces of human passage could be seen, forming a narrow path amidst the thorns and vegetation.</p><p>This wasn't truly deep within the mountains.</p><p>The path led from outside the mountain to its base and then disappeared. Overgrown with weeds, it was not easily discernible without close inspection, suggesting infrequent use. It was likely a hunting trail blazed by hunters venturing into the mountains.</p><p>Following the path outwards, the terrain gradually flattened. Qin Sang and his companions had spotted a mortal village in that direction when they arrived.</p><p>Beyond this mountain lay the true primeval forest, rarely trod by humans, where ferocious beasts gradually became more common.</p><p>Vermilion Bird was watching this very mountain path.</p><p>The sun had risen high, casting its rays upon the forest. At the other end of the path, a figure appeared.</p><p>The newcomer was a boy, seemingly fourteen or fifteen years old, dressed in coarse hemp clothing and straw sandals, clearly from a poor family.  Yet his clothes were clean, and his brow held a resolute air, along with a touch of scholarly refinement not usually found in common folk.</p><p>He walked with a bundle of hemp rope in one hand and a sharpened steel spike in the other. Despite the rugged path, his steps were surprisingly light.</p><p>The knuckles on the hand gripping the rope and spike were thick, clearly indicating martial arts training.</p><p>Hunters often practiced some form of martial arts; otherwise, even entering the mountains would be difficult, let alone hunting beasts.</p><p>Whether the boy was gathering firewood or hunting was unknown.  He was daring to enter the mountains alone at such a young age.</p><p>‘Rustle… Rustle… Rustle…’</p><p>He was, after all, not a cultivator, nor one of those martial artists capable of scaling walls and walking on snow without a trace. As he walked, his body brushed against the grass on either side of the path, inevitably making a sound.</p><p>The boy's brow remained furrowed in caution, constantly wary of dangers lurking in the undergrowth. He would pause to observe every few steps.</p><p>Soon, a mountain rose on the east side of the path, casting both the path and the boy into shadow.</p><p>It became apparent that the boy was not hunting. He slowed his pace here, constantly scrutinizing the mountainside to the right of the path.</p><p>This mountain wasn't as majestic and precipitous as the one where Qin Sang and his companions were.</p><p>This slope was sometimes steep, sometimes gentle, covered in vegetation. The steep sections had sheer cliffs hundreds of feet high, while the gentle slopes could be easily climbed.</p><p>The boy seemed to be searching for something, moving slowly, sometimes shaking his head, sometimes pausing to ponder.</p><p>Finally, he spotted a terrain that matched his expectations. His eyes lit up slightly, and he quickened his pace.</p><p>His target was a cliff face, standing about a hundred feet above the path, beyond a gentle slope.</p><p>Just as he was about to ascend, he seemed to remember something. He looked up at the sky, then marked a line on the ground with his steel spike.  His gaze swept over the slope before he gathered his strength, leaped, and landed steadily on a rock.  He repeated this several times until he reached the cliff face and looked up.</p><p>The cliff itself wasn't more than a hundred feet tall, but its surface was flat and covered with patches of grass.</p><p>A tree grew stubbornly upwards from a crevice, its trunk intertwined with vines. Two vines hung down, almost touching the ground.</p><p>The cliff face wasn't wide. Both sides were earthen slopes, and a large tree grew close to the cliff on the right side, its trunk also covered in vines.</p><p>The boy recognized these vines as being incredibly tough, capable of replacing rope.</p><p>He quickly scanned the entire cliff face, his eyes flickering in thought. Finally, his gaze settled on the top of the cliff.</p><p>Looking upwards, a shadow could be seen—a large boulder. Part of it jutted out, but its surface was uneven and rounded, raising concerns about it rolling down.</p><p>This boulder was the boy's objective. Employing the same technique, he jumped from the earthen slope to the top of the cliff. He pressed against the boulder, gently pushing it. The boulder remained motionless.</p><p>He increased his force, sensing a slight wobble in the boulder. A hint of joy appeared on his face. Ignoring the danger, he leaned over the edge of the cliff, examining where the boulder touched the cliff face, and tried to insert the steel spike.</p><p>He then continued to move up and down, measuring and comparing with the spike and rope.</p><p>Lost in his work, the boy suddenly remembered something. He looked at the line he had drawn earlier and realized the mountain's shadow was about to cross it. His expression tightened.  He quickly hid the spike and rope in the grass and ran back with all his might.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Vermilion Bird and Little Five, who had been watching with great interest, were surprised to see the boy suddenly flee as if encountering a predator.</p><p>“He’ll definitely be back tomorrow,” Vermilion Bird declared confidently.</p><p>The next day, at the same time, the boy arrived as expected.</p><p>This time, he brought a shovel.  He retrieved the rope and spike from the grass and continued his work.</p><p>As before, once the appointed time arrived, the boy left without hesitation.</p><p>From then on, as Qin Sang busied himself with repairing the Thunder Altar, the boy became a diversion for Vermilion Bird and Little Five's boredom.</p><p>Vermilion Bird even tried to wager with Little Five on what the boy was planning, but Little Five didn't take the bait.</p><p>This didn't dampen Vermilion Bird's enthusiasm.  She looked forward to sunrise every day.</p><p>However, to preserve their curiosity, neither of them used their divine abilities to investigate or pry into the boy's intentions.</p><p>Each time the boy returned, he brought new items.</p><p>For instance, wire mesh wrapped with iron nails, their unusual color suggesting they were poisoned.</p><p>Sharpened spears with wooden shafts and iron-banded tips.</p><p>And various mechanisms.</p><p>These mechanisms were the ingenuity of hunters, used for setting traps, their construction quite intricate.</p><p>The boy tested and experimented, taking more than ten days to select the most suitable mechanism.</p><p>“See! I guessed it on the first day.  He’s setting a trap!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird gloated, showing off to Little Five.</p><p>However, it was puzzling.  The boy was taking such pains, presumably to hunt an extremely ferocious beast, yet no such beast existed nearby.  The ferocious beasts of the deep mountains were also blocked by the mountain beneath Qin Sang, unable to cross over.</p><p>The boy was extremely patient. After more than a month of work, he finally finished setting the trap.</p><p>On the last day, the boy meticulously checked every mechanism, carefully cleaned up any traces, and even gathered moss from elsewhere to cover the unavoidable scratches on the stones.</p><p>Then, without leaving any bait or luring any beast, he ran home as soon as the time came.</p><p>“This kid’s concealment isn’t perfect.  I’ll help him.”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, never one to miss a good show, chuckled mischievously and flapped her wings.</p><p>For the next three days, the boy didn't appear, leaving Vermilion Bird restless and impatient. She almost flew to the village to drag the boy out and ask what he was up to.</p><p>On the fourth day, the sun rose in the east.</p><p>The boy finally reappeared.</p><p>His steps seemed heavier than before, yet his pace was still quick.</p><p>This time, the boy passed by the trap without stopping, heading straight for their mountain.</p><p>For the first time in days, the boy was venturing into the mountains.</p><p>The dense foliage couldn't obstruct Vermilion Bird and Little Five's view. They watched the boy move nimbly through the forest like a monkey.</p><p>He had a light crossbow strapped to his right arm. With the combination of traps and crossbow bolts, his harvest was bountiful.</p><p>When he descended the mountain, his bag held several birds, and he carried a small deer in his hand.</p><p>Back on the path, the boy glanced at the sky. It was almost time for him to leave.</p><p>This time, however, he didn't go home. Instead, he carried his game to the trap, built a bonfire at a pre-selected spot on the earthen slope north of the cliff, pulled out a bird, gutted it, and placed it on the fire to roast.</p><p>The bird was plump and quickly sizzled, releasing a fragrant aroma that drifted far and wide.</p><p>The boy's next action was surprising.  Unfazed by the aroma of roasting meat, he pulled a short blade from his waist, positioned it against his left arm, and after a few hesitant moments, pierced his skin, carving a deep wound, showing no mercy to himself.</p><p>Flesh parted, and bright red blood immediately stained his clothes. The scent of blood mingled with the aroma of roasting meat and wafted outwards.</p><p>‘Hiss!’</p><p>The boy gasped, tore off a piece of cloth, bit one end, and bandaged his wound.</p><p>The bleeding wasn't easily stopped, and the cloth quickly became soaked.</p><p>Pale from blood loss, the boy untied his waterskin, took a large gulp of wine, and then stared at the fire, concentrating on roasting the meat.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>A white shadow flashed on the mountaintop where the boy was, then vanished instantly.</p><p>“It’s here!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, who was enjoying the spectacle, lowered her voice in excitement, her eyes gleaming.</p><p>“No wonder. It’s hunting a demon!  This kid must have a death wish.”</p><p>Little Five’s eyes also flickered.</p><p>The white shadow’s movements couldn’t escape their notice. It was a Qi Refining stage White Weasel demon.</p><p>Although human martial artists, upon reaching the Innate Realm, possessed considerable combat prowess, potentially capable of battling low-level Qi Refining cultivators, this boy was clearly not such a master. To dare lure a White Weasel demon to kill it was audacious indeed.</p><p>The White Weasel moved stealthily, making no sound as it weaved through the undergrowth, silently approaching the boy from behind before suddenly pouncing.</p><p>The boy appeared to be focused on roasting the meat, but his mind was tense. However, the White Weasel was too fast. By the time he sensed the rush of air, it was too late to dodge.</p><p>The White Weasel closed in instantly, its sharp claws slashing towards the boy’s back.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sound of metal striking metal rang out.</p><p>Beneath the torn clothing, a metal plate was revealed.</p><p>Based on the bodies of the teacher and others, along with accounts from survivors, the boy had deduced that this demon favored sneak attacks, targeting the heart from behind. He had prepared the metal plate for protection.</p><p>However, the White Weasel’s claws were incredibly sharp, piercing the metal plate!</p><p>The boy felt a sharp pain in his back and a terrifying force impacting him through the metal. He instinctively lunged forward.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Facing the cliff face, he tumbled down towards the sandy ground below, taking the roasting rack with him.</p><p>Pain shot through his body, his organs jolted.</p><p>Incredibly, even as he fell, the boy twisted his body, aiming the light crossbow on his right arm behind him.</p><p>Having failed to kill its prey with one strike, the White Weasel shrieked.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>The cry was piercing.</p><p>Simultaneously, the White Weasel transformed into a white blur, leaping down after the boy, continuing its pursuit.  Its fur under its chin twitched, releasing a puff of white smoke that enveloped the boy.</p><p>Anticipating the White Weasel’s tactics, the boy had closed his eyes and held his breath.</p><p>Despite his thorough preparations, the screech made his head ring, and he felt dizzy, even though he had stuffed his ears with cotton.</p><p>White smoke and strange cries were terrifying demonic arts. The most skilled hunter in the village had died to these arts, utterly helpless, instilling fear in the villagers.</p><p>Fortunately, this White Weasel didn't appear in the morning. Villagers only dared to venture out then, sealing their doors and windows after midday, and no one dared to hunt demons.</p><p>These preparations were somewhat effective. The boy didn’t immediately lose consciousness.  With sheer willpower, he raised his left arm and fired the crossbow.</p><p>The White Weasel pounced.  Just as its claws were about to rip apart the boy’s left arm, the metal plate tied to his forearm, though torn and leaving a deep gash, provided some protection.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Three crossbow bolts shot out, their tips gleaming blue, coated with poison.</p><p>The White Weasel was forced to evade, twisting its body at impossible angles to avoid the three bolts, emerging unscathed.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The boy crashed heavily to the ground, coughing up blood.</p><p>The White Weasel greedily eyed the vibrant body and leaped down.</p><p>At that moment, something triggered a mechanism, and the sand on the ground erupted.</p><p>Two bent branches on trees on either side straightened simultaneously with a ‘bang’.</p><p>The vines hanging from the branches to the ground were yanked from the sand.</p><p>Several vines were tightly bound to the wire mesh. The mesh sprang up from the ground, sending a cloud of sand flying, instantly forming a net. The White Weasel was about to be caught inside, impaled by the poisoned nails.</p><p>However, as a demon, the White Weasel reacted swiftly, gripping the edge of the net and leaping high.</p><p>But the net’s spring trap had a chain reaction.  A vine pressed against the cliff face was pulled, dislodging a stone wedged against the edge of the boulder. The boulder immediately rolled down from the clifftop.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The gust of wind ruffled the White Weasel’s fur.</p><p>The entire White Weasel was enveloped in the boulder’s shadow. Even with its cultivation, being crushed by the boulder would shatter its bones.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>The White Weasel, enraged, let out a furious shriek.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>In the nick of time, the White Weasel hastily expelled a puff of white smoke, momentarily hindering the boulder. It clawed at the boulder’s edge, kicked off with its hind legs, and performed a somersault, narrowly escaping.</p><p>But that wasn't the entirety of the trap.  As the boulder fell, a third chain reaction was triggered. A mechanism clicked on the ground, and cold, sharp points emerged from the grass.</p><p>Five poisoned spears on each side, seizing the moment when the White Weasel was airborne and without leverage, shot out.</p><p>‘Swish! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The force of the poisoned spears rivaled that of a powerful crossbow, their speed lightning fast.</p><p>Ten poisoned spears crisscrossed, leaving the White Weasel no escape. Its shriek of rage turned into a terrified scream.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Demon blood left a trail on the ground.</p><p>A poisoned spear pierced the White Weasel, its tip embedding deeply into a tree trunk, the shaft still quivering.</p><p>“Magnificent!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird clapped her wings enthusiastically. “Unfortunately, that little weasel carries the aura of a cultivator. It’s probably someone's pet.  This boy is in trouble.”</p>
