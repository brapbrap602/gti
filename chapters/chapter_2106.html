<h1>Chapter 2097: Dharma Idol Displays Might</h1><p>Si Lu and Min Zhuo confronted each other high in the sky.</p><p>The demon cultivators below, having narrowly escaped death, were still shaken. However, they were, after all, the elite of the demon race. After the initial panic, they rallied around the Phoenix Queen, forming a defensive formation.</p><p>They were caught between the colossal dragon and the crimson-feathered bird.</p><p>The dragon's tail rested on the water's surface, like a range of undulating mountains stretching endlessly into the distance. Its body soared upwards, its head reaching into the clouds, exuding an overwhelming sense of pressure.</p><p>On the other hand, the crimson-feathered bird appeared small and fragile, yet it held the dragon at bay.</p><p>The Phoenix Queen was also terrified, forcing a calm expression onto her face. From their earlier exchange, she had guessed that the one attacking them was Min Zhuo, the Patriarch of the Changyou Clan.  They had made countless calculations, but they never anticipated that Min Zhuo would break through to the second level of the Void Realm so quickly.</p><p>This shift in power was a catastrophic blow to the Storm Realm.</p><p>Had the mysterious expert not intervened, she didn't know how many demon cultivators would have survived today.</p><p>But where did this mysterious expert come from?</p><p>Why did he stop Min Zhuo and save her? And who was the 'true master' he mentioned?</p><p>The more the Phoenix Queen thought about it, the more she felt a chill down her spine. She stood at the apex of the Storm Realm, yet how many secrets were hidden beneath the surface, secrets even she was unaware of?</p><p>Could it be that Fairy Liu Li had also broken through to the Soul Formation stage and was now observing the every move of the demon race in the Demon Sea?</p><p>The Phoenix Queen couldn't think of any other possibility.</p><p>Suppressing her unease, she left her treasure ship and flew into the sky, bowing deeply before the crimson-feathered bird. "Junior Huang Yun offers her deepest gratitude to Senior for intervening and stopping our formidable foe."</p><p>As she approached the crimson-feathered bird, the Phoenix Queen's unease intensified. She had initially assumed the other party was a senior of the demon race, but there wasn't a trace of demonic aura about them.</p><p>"You are the Phoenix Queen?"</p><p>The crimson-feathered bird appraised Huang Yun, offering a simple assessment, "Fortune and misfortune are not predetermined, but self-inflicted."</p><p>The Phoenix Queen's expression stiffened, rendered speechless.</p><p>"No need for thanks. I intervened not for your sake."</p><p>The crimson-feathered bird stared intently at the dragon opposite, its gaze wary. "The following matters do not concern you. Take your subordinates and retreat to the side, awaiting judgment."</p><p>The Phoenix Queen dared not argue, nor did she dare to leave without permission.  She retreated to the sea's surface, leading her forces away from the battlefield where the two powerhouses faced off, waiting obediently in the distance.</p><p>Min Zhuo looked down at the water, watching the demon cultivators withdraw without intervening. "It seems, fellow Daoist, that you are determined to oppose me.  We have no grievances. Why must you be my enemy?"</p><p>"If you can restrain yourself for a moment, I will not take action against you, and we will not be mortal enemies," the crimson-feathered bird responded calmly.</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression shifted between cloudy and clear, then he snorted coldly. "I wonder who this 'true master' you speak of is, what their identity is, and what reason they have for interfering in our conflict?"</p><p>Without waiting for Si Lu's reply, Min Zhuo continued, "Do you know that the feud between our clan and these foreign races has lasted for nearly a thousand years? I don't know how many of our clan members have died on the battlefield, how many talented youths have been cruelly murdered by them.  This is a blood feud, irreconcilable!  Do you think a few words from you can resolve it?"</p><p>The crimson-feathered bird responded curiously, "After all I've said, you still haven't understood? What does your feud have to do with me? As long as you don't attack before me, I won't stop you."</p><p>Min Zhuo laughed in fury, and the dragon roared in response.</p><p>The dragon's roar shook the heavens and earth, and some of the demon cultivators felt their minds tremble upon hearing it.</p><p>Seeing Min Zhuo's restlessness, the crimson-feathered bird's gaze narrowed slightly. "Your aura is somewhat unstable, indicating a recent breakthrough, and your cultivation is not yet fully consolidated. You are not my match. Do not misjudge your own strength."</p><p>Min Zhuo snorted, his expression changing repeatedly, as if weighing the gains and losses in his mind.</p><p>After a long while, he pretended to have just recognized Si Lu's identity, feigning surprise. "Could this be the legendary Companion Beast? Do you hail from the Siyou Clan?"</p><p>"You have a keen eye, fellow Daoist. I am indeed a member of the Siyou Clan," Si Lu admitted frankly.</p><p>"Since you are an expert of the Siyou Clan, are you unaware that our superior clan is the Zhuyan Clan, and this is the Zhuyan Clan's territory?  Do you not fear provoking the wrath of the Zhuyan Clan by barging into another clan's territory and acting so recklessly?" Min Zhuo's tone carried an implicit threat.</p><p>"Thank you for your concern, fellow Daoist. However, since I am here, it is naturally with the permission of the Zhuyan Clan," the crimson-feathered bird replied nonchalantly, completely unfazed by the threat.</p><p>…</p><p>On the Spirit Island.</p><p>Si Lu remotely controlled his Companion Beast, his mind linked with it, deterring Min Zhuo.  Just then, he suddenly opened his eyes and looked towards the sky, waving his hand to open the circular mirror seal as someone entered.</p><p>"Brother Qin."</p><p>Si Lu, focused on controlling his Companion Beast, did not rise, nodding to Qin Sang. "Your Dharma Idol?"</p><p>She hadn't sensed Qin Sang's Dharma Idol's aura; only his true body was present.</p><p>"Greetings, Great Lord!"</p><p>The Black Lion Great Sage and the two Demon Marquises bowed in unison.</p><p>"My Dharma Idol has gone to the Sacred Cleansing Plains," Qin Sang said, landing gracefully.</p><p>"The Sacred Cleansing Plains?" Si Lu recalled the location and was somewhat surprised. "Brother Qin intends to…"</p><p>"Just taking precautions!"</p><p>Qin Sang had sent his Dharma Idol to the Changyou Clan's sacred lake, in case negotiations failed and they had to resort to force. He not only wanted to subdue the Changyou Clan Patriarch on the spot but also ideally control the Changyou Clan's sacred lake.</p><p>He didn't know how the Changyou Clan communicated with the outside world, whether through divine abilities or some kind of treasure. If it was a treasure, and it wasn't on the Changyou Clan Patriarch, it would be kept within the sacred lake.</p><p>His Dharma Idol had also taken the Heavenly Eye Butterfly with him, hoping to use its Heavenly Eye divine ability to probe for weaknesses in the sacred lake's grand formation.</p><p>If they could capture it in one fell swoop and secretly control the Changyou Clan, they would solve the problem permanently.</p><p>However, the sacred grounds of the foreign races were not easily breached.  Qin Sang had consulted Si Lu and Ji Hong; these sacred grounds were the most important and mysterious places of each clan, all originating from ancient times.</p><p>Even the sacred ground of a small clan like the Changyou Clan was not simple and might even possess hidden mechanisms unknown even to its own members, mechanisms that would only activate in times of crisis.</p><p>A rash attack, even if they had the power to breach the sacred ground, would make it difficult to contain the news. Due to the constraints of the ancient covenant, if the Zhuyan Clan learned of an attack on the Changyou Clan's sacred ground, they would certainly intervene!</p><p>Now that the situation had taken a sharp turn, even though Qin Sang knew the chances were slim, he would have to try if necessary.</p><p>"What was that person's reaction upon seeing you, fellow Daoist?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"He was eager to fight, even wanting to engage me directly.  Even after I revealed Brother Qin's existence, he showed no signs of apprehension or retreat," Si Lu replied, puzzled.</p><p>This wasn't what they had anticipated.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Patriarch had only recently broken through.  He would be hard-pressed to deal with a single opponent of the same level.  Learning that there was another helper, he should have chosen to retreat and observe.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, his voice deep. "It seems he has something else to rely on."</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "That must be it! However, the Changyou Clan also seems to be proficient in water-type transformation techniques.  That might not have been his true body, perhaps just a bluff, with his true body having long since fled elsewhere."</p><p>A Companion Beast was, after all, not the true body and subject to various limitations. Si Lu couldn't be certain whether that was the Changyou Clan Patriarch's true body or a manifestation.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed. "That makes sense. I'll go and meet him!  However, there's one more thing I'd like to ask you, fellow Daoist. You mentioned some details about the ancient covenant earlier. Could you elaborate?"</p><p>Si Lu answered without reservation.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang ascended into the sky, leaving the Spirit Island with Si Lu.</p><p>As they approached the battlefield, Qin Sang and Si Lu separated. He found a suitable location, and a cyan light emanated from above his head. The Azure鸾 Dharma Idol spread its wings and soared into the sky, transforming into a bolt of lightning, piercing through the air, thunder shaking the sea, making no attempt to conceal the sound of his Thunder Escape.</p><p>Soon, the Azure鸾 Dharma Idol neared the battlefield, and Min Zhuo faintly sensed an incomparably powerful aura rushing towards him.</p><p>Min Zhuo abruptly looked up. "Is this the person you mentioned, fellow Daoist?"</p><p>"It is this humble Daoist!"</p><p>The voice boomed like thunder.</p><p>In the next instant, a bolt of lightning tore through the heavens.  Min Zhuo's vision was instantly filled with blinding light, and he felt a sharp pain in his eyes as an overwhelmingly powerful aura rapidly approached.</p><p>This aura was so terrifying that it made Min Zhuo's heart tremble.</p><p>After breaking through to the second level of the Void Realm, he hadn't yet fought a full-blown battle against an opponent of the same level, but he was certain that ordinary cultivators at the early stage of the second level of the Void Realm wouldn't be a match for this person.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Thunder seemed to pierce through the void, and Min Zhuo's face changed drastically, feeling the danger close at hand.</p><p>He hadn't expected the other party to attack without a word. Fortunately, he had remained vigilant and reacted quickly, immediately summoning the dragon for protection.</p><p>Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger.</p><p>The dragon stirred up the seawater, and torrential rain poured down. Amidst the curtain of rain, the dragon soared into the sky and immediately collided with the lightning.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Brilliant lightning erupted, and electric snakes shot out in all directions.</p><p>In mid-air, the dragon's body stiffened, its head straining upwards, trying to block the enemy.</p><p>At the very center of its two horns, a gigantic bird claw had appeared, its sharp talons piercing deep into the dragon's flesh, lightning flowing between them.</p><p>With a resounding boom, the dragon's head exploded, its body, formed from seawater, transforming into a mass of clear water, streaks of lightning still visible within.</p><p>With the head destroyed, the dragon's body instantly shattered, and the rain intensified, as if the waters of the celestial river were pouring down upon the earth.</p><p>Min Zhuo groaned and retreated, appearing utterly disheveled. His eyes revealed a look of shock.  This was a divine ability he had comprehended after his breakthrough, yet it had been shattered by a single claw!</p><p>The disparity in strength between cultivators of the same level could be unimaginable.</p><p>Amidst the wind and rain, the owner of the bird claw slowly revealed itself. A divine Azure鸾 stood proudly in the air, looking down at Min Zhuo with a hint of disdain.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, was quite surprised, for he discovered that Min Zhuo was not a manifestation, but his true body!</p><p>The foundation of the foreign races' cultivation lay in the innate divine abilities inherited from their ancestors. However, to return to their origins and reach the Saint Realm or Ancestral Realm was not a simple matter. It required the aid of cultivation techniques to enhance themselves.  Unlike humans, they viewed these techniques as vehicles and stepping stones to their ultimate goal, which was to comprehend their innate divine abilities.</p><p>Ultimately, it boiled down to cultivating the Nascent Soul, tempering the physical body, and absorbing spiritual energy, namely, the three paths of Spirit, Dharma, and Body.  Based on Qin Sang's understanding of the Changyou Clan, they belonged to the Dharma cultivator category, while the Zhuyan Clan undoubtedly belonged to the Body cultivator lineage.</p><p>However, because the strength of the foreign races was closely tied to their divine abilities and bloodline, some foreign races, even though they were Dharma cultivators, couldn't separate their Dharma Idols to fight, otherwise their strength would be greatly diminished.</p><p>Of course, some clans had found ways to circumvent this, such as Si Lu, whose four Companion Beasts combined were even more powerful than a Dharma Idol.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't encountered a second Void Realm level two expert from the Changyou Clan, so he wasn't sure if they were subject to this limitation.</p><p>It was illogical for Min Zhuo to risk his true body like this.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something amiss.  Sending his Dharma Idol while remaining hidden was the right move.</p><p>"Who are you!"</p><p>Min Zhuo steadied himself, not panicking, and questioned loudly.</p><p>"You don't recognize me?"</p><p>The Azure鸾 Dharma Idol spoke, its voice like thunder, its eyes flashing with sharp lightning. Cyan light erupted from its body, transforming into Qin Sang's form.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's face, Min Zhuo was puzzled.  The other party's tone suggested he should recognize him.</p><p>But…</p><p>Min Zhuo's heart suddenly stirred, recalling an intelligence report he had received a long time ago.  Qin Sang's features now seemed familiar.</p><p>"You are…"</p><p>Min Zhuo remembered.</p><p>The sacred statue enshrined in the Green Ram Temple, hailed as a Saint, revered by all races and sects, seemingly closely related to Fairy Liu Li – it was this person!</p><p>"It seems you've remembered, fellow Daoist! It is indeed I!"</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, "You speak of a blood feud, of countless Changyou Clan experts killed and wounded.  How many of our experts have been slaughtered by you?  Although I have the power to annihilate the Changyou Clan, I don't wish to escalate the conflict and have refrained from interfering. You've broken through to the second level of the Void Realm, making you my peer, yet you disregard your status, rushing out of seclusion, resorting to bullying the weak, slaughtering countless fellow Daoists of my Demon Sea!"</p><p>His voice was filled with righteous anger. "You just said that a blood feud justifies killing!  In that case, it is also justifiable for me to kill you!"</p><p>"Cease your nonsense! That Saint Qin is a human, and you are a demon…"</p><p>For some reason, despite knowing Zai Zhen was behind him, Min Zhuo felt a pang of panic and hastily argued.</p><p>He stopped abruptly mid-sentence.</p><p>Hailed as Saint Qin and enshrined in the Green Ram Temple, did that necessarily mean he was human?</p><p>It was important to remember that the Green Ram Temple once housed many demon race experts, who occupied half of the temple. Later, they were supposedly wiped out by the Mist Tide, leaving only a single raccoon demon.</p><p>Min Zhuo believed the other party was feigning an identity for legitimacy, but it was difficult to expose him.</p><p>His thoughts raced, and just as he was about to speak, a sudden warning surged within him.  He saw cyan light filling the sky, pressing down towards him.</p><p>Seeing the other party about to attack again without hesitation, Min Zhuo was secretly alarmed.  From his sleeve, he shot out a milky white stream of light – an exquisite jade bowl.</p><p>This was a spiritual treasure bestowed upon him by that mysterious being.  Within the jade bowl, clear water rippled, a bowl full.</p><p>Just then, from the corner of his eye, Min Zhuo caught sight of crimson flames blazing towards the sky.  He immediately felt the water within the jade bowl stagnate.  That Siyou Clan expert was also attacking!</p><p>They clearly intended to kill him!</p><p>He was already struggling to cope with one; facing a two-pronged attack, defeat was certain!</p><p>In this critical moment, Min Zhuo no longer cared about any agreements and cried out, "Brother Zai, save me!"</p><p>"Alas!"</p><p>A sigh echoed through the void, and a figure appeared beside Min Zhuo.</p>
