<h1>Chapter 2115: True Thunder Forging Talismans</h1><p>The standing man withdrew his gaze from the chessboard, turned to look, and echoed, "It shows how much the Yuanxiang chieftain values those outsiders. This plan will succeed!" The man playing chess, however, was doubtful. He looked at the person in white robes across the board. "They are nothing but insignificant outsiders. Even if the Yuanxiang chieftain fails to protect them, leading to their extinction, will it truly create a rift between the Zhuyan tribe and that faction? My uncle said that faction is an outside force, but I don't know how they obtained the Mirage Tower. Being outsiders, if they want to achieve anything in the Sacred Land, they won't easily abandon the Zhuyan tribe as an ally." "Frozen ground thaws slowly! If this plan fails, there's always next time.  Accumulated over time, it will surely create estrangement! One less ally means the Zhuyan tribe's power is weakened, and our chances increase." The standing man paused, also looking at the man in white robes. "Besides, my uncle should have another goal this time, which is to win over that Lu family's Grand Protector, right? I wonder what makes that Grand Protector so special to warrant my uncle's attention?" As they spoke, the Siyou army outside the mountain had assembled, and the Grand Protector invited Yuan Miao to board the Lu King's palanquin.</p><p>The sky was filled with black crows.</p><p>The palanquin soared into the air, transforming into a rainbow heading east. The vast army followed the palanquin, their momentum shaking the heavens, changing the color of the wind and clouds!</p><p>The man in white robes watched the Siyou army depart calmly without speaking.</p><p>The two brothers exchanged a glance, wisely refraining from asking further questions. The man playing chess returned his attention to the game, pondering for a moment before finally making his move.</p><p>'Snap!' The palanquin led the way, with the army following behind.</p><p>In the sky, dark clouds rolled, the clouds resembling a surging river, rushing eastward.</p><p>The Zhuyan tribe and its vassal tribes would not allow them to continue using the teleportation array, so they could only follow the agreed route, traversing the Zhuyan territory and flying to the Storm Realm on their own. They made no attempt to conceal themselves, nor did they need to.  If Silu’s intelligence network is functioning properly, they must have already been alerted.</p><p>On top of the palanquin was a jade orb the size of a human head, emitting colorful rays of light. The dark clouds beneath the army were dyed by the radiance, becoming vibrant and multicolored. The Siyou soldiers felt their bodies lighten, their speed increasing significantly, while their energy consumption was greatly reduced.</p><p>The army marched swiftly. Inside the palanquin, the Grand Protector invited Yuan Miao to the guest seat, while he himself sat below the Lu King.</p><p>The Lu King himself was a mid-stage Void Realm Double expert, with the Imperial Tutor and the Lu family's Grand Protector flanking him on either side.</p><p>Facing three experts alone, Yuan Miao inwardly despaired. Those in his tribe capable of handling the situation all believed that they were better off cultivating in seclusion than fighting, and they had passed the responsibility on to him.</p><p>Fortunately, he had exceptional composure and a thirst for battle. Even on a life-or-death battlefield, he wouldn't be afraid.  He responded to their inquiries calmly and coolly, acting befitting his role as military observer.</p><p>After a series of exchanges, an awkward silence fell within the palanquin.</p><p>After flying for an unknown distance, the Grand Protector and the Tutor seemed to sense something and looked ahead, followed by the Lu King. Yuan Miao only then noticed a presence ahead, seemingly waiting for the army.</p><p>This presence was familiar, and Yuan Miao immediately recognized the person's identity, his expression slightly darkening.</p><p>The palanquin slowed down, the Grand Protector stood up, flew out of the palanquin, and quickly returned with someone.</p><p>The person was Min Zhuo, the chieftain of the Changyou tribe.</p><p>Min Zhuo entered the hall, saw Yuan Miao, and paused, then solemnly bowed, "Min Zhuo pays his respects to Envoy Yuan!"</p><p>Nominally, the Changyou tribe was still a vassal of the Zhuyan tribe, so courtesy could not be abandoned.</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded, without directly questioning or reprimanding him.</p><p>In fact, Yuan Miao did not harbor ill feelings toward Min Zhuo. As the leader of his tribe, he fearlessly defied authority, never compromising, and relentlessly pursuing revenge for his people, a spirit quite to Yuan Miao's liking.</p><p>Since the superior tribe wouldn't help, what right did they have to blame him for seeking help from outsiders?</p><p>If this succeeded, he would hold Min Zhuo in higher regard.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean Yuan Miao would favor Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo was prepared to face a storm of wrath, but instead, the matter was gently passed over. Surprised, he nevertheless felt relieved, took two steps forward, and bowed, "Min Zhuo greets the Lu King!"</p><p>"You are the chieftain of the Changyou tribe. This King has long admired your name!"</p><p>The Lu King smiled warmly, gesturing with his hand, "We have kept Chieftain Min Zhuo waiting. Please, be seated."</p><p>"Thank you, Lu King!"</p><p>Min Zhuo sat upright, eyes fixed ahead, "Hearing that the Lu King is leading his army to punish the aggressors, I am overjoyed. My tribe finally has hope for revenge, and I have personally come to welcome the royal army!"</p><p>He had prepared many more words of flattery but, fearing they might upset Yuan Miao and cause complications, he swallowed them.</p><p>Lu Wang let out a hearty laugh.  "Thanks to Chieftain Min Zhuo's warning, we knew the rebels had fled here. This expedition to subdue the rebels is also to avenge Chieftain Min Zhuo. Once we succeed, we'll all be greatly rewarded.  The King and the Shao Shi will personally petition the Emperor on Chieftain Min Zhuo's behalf!"</p><p>He and the Grand Minister both looked at the Shao Shi standing beside them. The Shao Shi, with a pleasant smile, idly played with a jade cup, making no comment.</p><p>They both thought to themselves, 'Old fox.'  This time, Lu Wang had met with the Emperor and obtained an imperial decree and the Shao Shi's participation.  Beyond the Shao Shi, the Emperor hadn't sent a single soldier; the army consisted entirely of Lu Wang's troops and their allies.</p><p>The wording of the decree was carefully chosen, stating that Lu Wang had reported the Si family's rebellion in Yan Mountain with irrefutable evidence. The expedition was ostensibly to bring the Si family descendants back to face the Emperor and be questioned.</p><p>This way, if things went wrong, the royal family could easily distance themselves. Before gaining a significant advantage, don't expect the Shao Shi to truly exert himself.</p><p>Of course, Lu Wang wasn't going to let the royal family reap all the benefits. After some bargaining, he also obtained a battle formation diagram to counter the enemy's array.</p><p>Yuan Miao glanced at Min Zhuo, thinking, "It was indeed the Changyou clan that leaked the information."</p><p>Min Zhuo showed no sign of pride. He humbly replied, "I dare not take credit.  Seeking aid was for our own survival.  If Lu Wang can severely damage the enemy and reclaim our homeland, I'll be satisfied. This is the intelligence I've recently gathered; please have a look, Lord Lu Wang. Unfortunately, the enemy is powerful, and several of my old friends dare not offend them. I acted alone and didn't dare get too close."</p><p>Pleased by Min Zhuo's modesty, Lu Wang took the jade slip, examined it, and shook his head slightly.  As Min Zhuo said, it contained little valuable information, less than Lu Gan's investigation had yielded.</p><p>Maintaining a calm expression, Lu Wang handed the jade slip to the Grand Minister and continued, "Regarding defeating the enemy, Chieftain Min Zhuo, what strategies do you suggest?"</p><p>Min Zhuo stood up and said solemnly, "I'm inexperienced and unqualified to comment.  I observe that Lu Wang's army is strong and formidable, and I believe a straightforward assault will cause the enemy to flee in terror. I'm willing to lead my clan's elite warriors and follow Lord Lu Wang's commands!"</p><p>Yuan Miao heard Lu Wang and Min Zhuo's conversation but remained silent, eyes closed, as if meditating.</p><p>…</p><p>Storm World.</p><p>At this moment, all the altars were completed according to Qin Sang's instructions, countless altars spread across the Storm World.</p><p>The Four Regions of the North Sea, the Central Continent, the East Sea, the Canglang Sea, the Demon Sea…</p><p>Humans, Witches, Demons…</p><p>Shaohua Mountain, Xuantian Palace, Great Compassion Temple, Northern Wasteland Demon Clan, Eight Scenic Spots…</p><p>Regardless of race or alignment, all cultivators and forces in the Storm World possessing altars received the same order: they were to stand ready before their altars.</p><p>Zhuque, Sili, and Su Nu were stationed at three core altars.</p><p>After supervising the construction of the Canglang Sea altar, Sili switched places with Zhuque, taking command of the Western Region altar.  The enemy was most likely to attack from the west, and Sili's presence would be needed there.</p><p>Witch Clan Sacred Mountain.</p><p>One altar was built on the broken mountain.</p><p>A spirit cicada hovered before the altar; behind it stood a young Witch clan member, Fang Laomo's adopted son.</p><p>The other altars also had varying levels of importance, with different requirements for the individuals stationed there. This altar required both Fang Laomo and his adopted son.</p><p>Further back, other Witch clan cultivators, all at the Yuan Ying stage, stood tense.</p><p>Their auras differed from other Witch clan members because they had been cultivating a Daoist thunder technique to prepare for the altar activation.</p><p>Fang Laomo remained suspended in the air.</p><p>Ten thousand miles above the altar, the sky was clear and silent.</p><p>The young Witch waited for a long time, seeing no reaction from the altar, and looked up at the sky. At this moment, countless cultivators in the Storm World were anxiously waiting, just like him.</p><p>Unfortunately, the altar remained motionless until sunset, when twilight shrouded the land.  Finally, the altar trembled, then emitted a brilliant light, scattering a clear glow, and strange fluctuations emanated from it.</p><p>"Activate the altar!"</p><p>Fang Laomo suddenly flew to the top of the altar.</p><p>The young Witch immediately rushed to the front of the altar. Other Witch clan cultivators dispersed, forming a formation surrounding the altar, their fingers forming hand seals, ready to cast spells.</p><p>After another moment, the altar suddenly inhaled and exhaled spiritual light, engulfing Fang Laomo's figure.  Then, the sound of cicadas filled everyone's ears.</p><p>The young Witch's eyes narrowed, his hand seals rapidly changing.  The sound of thunder echoed, and lightning flashed around the altar.</p><p>Amidst a flash of lightning, a colossal, ethereal altar appeared in the void, seemingly formed naturally, gathering celestial power and resonating with a mysterious presence in the distance.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded across the Storm Realm.</p><p>The young Wu clan member, though not the altar master, remained observant, his surprise growing.  While constructing the altar, he hadn't noticed, but now, as it activated, he sensed he was merging with a vast, powerful force through the altar.</p><p>He could only vaguely perceive this power, its strength unknown, yet his altar was merely a tiny, insignificant part of it!</p><p>Since the Qingyang Temple ceremony, a profound reverence had settled in his heart.</p><p>Meanwhile, Su Nu, Zhu Que, and Si Lu, stationed at the three core sub-altars, felt the altar array's power firsthand, their expressions varying.</p><p>Countless altars channeled their power towards them. While the sub-altar masters might seem insignificant to Void Refinement cultivators, the combined might of so many altars was undeniable. Yet, this power, however great, was likely insufficient to stop the Siyou army.</p><p>Si Lu, eyes closed, eyelids twitching slightly, urged herself to remain calm. She controlled only a portion of the array; the main altar was at Qingyang Temple. If Qin Sang was so confident, and the array was complete, perhaps its power would truly be earth-shattering!</p><p>At that moment, they all sensed Qin Sang’s mental command and immediately activated their altars according to his instructions.</p><p>The array truly started, yet its might remained concealed, without any spectacular celestial phenomena.</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body returned, his Dharma body merging with it.</p><p>The main altar beneath him was complete: a square lower section, an octagonal middle section, and a round upper section, all covered in countless, incredibly intricate runes, dizzying to behold.</p><p>However, the Thunder Altar lacked one final, crucial element – the Thunder Oath Talisman!</p><p>After conferring with the Yuanxiang clan leader, Qin Sang was confident and rushed back to Qingyang Temple to inscribe the talisman.</p><p>The talisman was the altar's core.  Inscribing a fourth-order Thunder Oath Talisman was beyond Qin Sang's current capabilities, so he decided to use the power of the Qingluan True Thunder.</p><p>He had been preparing for this since Yue Du Bay and was fully ready.</p><p>He steadily drew wisps of Qingluan True Thunder from the phoenix wings.  As expected, the Qingluan True Thunder’s high order allowed him to inscribe the talisman's runes without difficulty, greatly easing his burden.</p><p>Rune after rune was inscribed on the altar, progressing smoothly until the final, critical step.</p><p>The talisman's formation!</p><p>This required the array and the combined power of all the altar masters to assist him.</p><p>As Su Nu, Zhu Que, and Si Lu activated their sub-altars, the main altar’s power erupted, transforming the sky above Qingyang Temple into a sea of thunder. Even before the Thunder Oath Talisman was complete, the Thunder Altar's might was comparable to that of the past.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, enveloped by the ethereal shadow of the Thunder Altar. His wings spread wide, wisps of greenish-blue thunder filled the air, until he became one with the altar, a swirling mass of lightning.</p><p>As the lightning flashed, countless runes shimmered, yet without chaos. They combined into the talisman form, appearing and disappearing.</p><p>Even as individual runes, they seemed more complex than third-order talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in these runes, as if in an ocean of talismans. The successful formation of the Thunder Oath Talisman would undoubtedly revolutionize his understanding of talismanic arts!</p><p>*Crackle!  Rumble!* The Qingyang Temple protective array activated, concealing the celestial phenomena.</p><p>Lost in his work within the thunderous energy, Qin Sang guided each rune to its rightful place.</p><p>Gradually, fewer runes remained scattered. In the center of the thunder sea, a ball of lightning grew brighter and more intense.</p><p>Inside the lightning, everything was chaotic, indicating that the runes were merging.  Gradually, a hazy outline emerged, like a sheet of lightning, but not silver, this time it was green!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang reappeared on the main altar—he had never truly left.</p><p>*Swish!* Qin Sang opened his eyes, his gaze fixed on the ethereal lightning sheet, and unleashed a hand seal.</p><p>At that moment, all the altar masters felt a strange tremor, fleeting and gone before they could react. The altar's power suddenly subsided.</p><p>Su Nu, Zhu Que, and Si Lu sensed a change in the altar, but couldn't quite define it.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and extended a hand.</p><p>A green lightning sheet, light as a feather, gently drifted into his palm, then through his hand, into the altar.</p>
