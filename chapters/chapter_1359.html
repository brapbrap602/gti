<h1>Chapter 1351 Ascension (Extra chapter for esteemed盟主气质游走!)</h1><p>Chapter 1351 Ascension (Extra chapter for esteemed盟主气质游走!)</p><p>“If you focused on the immortal path, you might yet surpass me.”</p><p>Ye Laomo suddenly seemed listless, a hint of regret in his tone.  If not for the Ascension Platform giving him the chance to ascend, he would have reigned supreme in the Northern Star Realm, crushing all past foes beneath his feet.</p><p>Standing at the peak, alone.</p><p>It would be lonely, indeed.</p><p>Around the green platform, spatial turbulence grew increasingly dense. Soon, escape would be impossible.</p><p>Below the Ascension Platform,</p><p>the Tianxing Alliance’s Yuan Ying cultivators were filled with worry.  Ye Laomo had said earlier that only those at the late Yuan Ying stage had a chance of survival; it seemed he wasn’t exaggerating.  The Mysterious Lord and the True Person Cang Hong had been forced to retreat.</p><p>Only True Daoist remained.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance’s twin warriors, True Daoist’s true disciples, raised practically as his own sons, were frantic, like ants on a hot plate.</p><p>True Daoist’s figure swayed in the storm, his eyes closed, ignoring Ye Laomo’s taunts.  He unleashed all his techniques, showing no thought of retreat, fighting with absolute determination!</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Ye Laomo’s eyes. He dropped his mocking expression and looked directly at True Daoist.</p><p>At that moment, the Purple Micro Palace soared higher, disappearing into the spatial storm.</p><p>A new landmass appeared in the sky, embedded within the void.</p><p>The celestial palace ascended!</p><p>“It’s time.”</p><p>Ye Laomo murmured, lightly tapping his foot.</p><p>The Ascension Platform trembled.</p><p>The green platform shuddered, emitting a green beam of light that shot into the depths of the void. Ancient runes spread, the green light engulfing everyone.</p><p>“Don’t forget your promise to me!”</p><p>Bai suddenly opened his eyes, shouting, and formed a hand seal. The binding ropes on Yu Gu shattered inch by inch, the remaining power erupting.</p><p>Then, Bai’s flesh and bones writhed, cracking and popping.</p><p>‘Pop! Pop!’</p><p>He severed his own arms and legs.</p><p>But that wasn’t enough!</p><p>Bai, a corpse cultivator, seemed to feel no pain; his expression remained unchanged as he mechanically removed every bone from his body, laying them out before him.</p><p>Each bone bore a bone curse, arranged according to a pattern.  He was repeating the Water Prison mysterious person’s method, refining himself into a bone formation!</p><p>Even for Yuan Ying cultivators, this was shockingly audacious.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>Finally, only Bai’s head remained, settling into the core of the bone formation.</p><p>Ye Laomo was stunned.</p><p>He valued Bai highly, but had refrained from trying to recruit him, harboring his own plans.  Given Bai and Qing Jun’s strength, they wouldn’t be able to safely pass through the spatial turbulence, inevitably seeking his help.  He only wanted what was in Bai’s mind; a remnant soul would suffice.</p><p>“I never expected this guy to self-mutilate. Could there be something I haven’t accounted for?” Ye Laomo thought.</p><p>The bone formation was complete!</p><p>At that instant, everyone on the green platform felt a tightening sensation, pulled involuntarily towards the void by the green light.  The celestial palace happened to be in the path of the light.</p><p>The spatial storm was partially blocked by the palace, but those lacking sufficient strength would be crushed into pulp, leaving not a trace.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the spatial storm was overhead.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The green light was struck.</p><p>The bone formation pulsed with a pale light, protecting Qing Jun.</p><p>True Daoist spat out blood, his face pale as paper. He gave a wry smile, lifting his eyelids to look at Ye Laomo, in a gesture that was both a sigh and a self-mockery, “I am not as good as you.”</p><p>Seeing this, the twin warriors knelt and wailed, “Master!”</p><p>Ye Laomo was absorbed in observing Qing Jun and the bone formation.</p><p>The bone formation creaked.</p><p>A soul light, enveloping a piece of decayed wood, shot out from the formation, entering a small wooden carving on Qing Jun’s waist. The carving, initially featureless, gradually took on Bai’s likeness.</p><p>Simultaneously, Yu Gu, after enduring immense torment, finally succumbed, perishing with a roar of resentment.</p><p>He didn't die in the prison of the Sinful God Palace.</p><p>He had survived from ancient times to the present day.</p><p>Only to die at the hands of a group of Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>After Yu Gu’s death, a wisp of gray energy shot into Qing Jun’s brow, far larger than before.</p><p>Qing Jun’s body trembled slightly; she raised her head slightly.</p><p>The same scene as before with Ye Laomo played out. Her aura rapidly soared, instantly breaking through to the late Yuan Ying stage, matching Ye Laomo’s strength!</p><p>At this moment, even the collapse of the heavens could not overshadow Qing Jun’s peerless grace!</p><p>Below the Ascension Platform.</p><p>Everyone was numb.  In a single day, two powerful cultivators appeared in Beichen.</p><p>They could guess that Qing Jun's breakthrough was fishy, seemingly involving absorbing the Jade Bone, strengthening her heart demon puppet mark, and merging it with herself.</p><p>Unlike Ye Laomo's self-cultivation breakthrough.</p><p>This method either left hidden dangers or only temporarily sustained the late Yuan Ying stage, with a later regression.  But this minor flaw didn't diminish Qing Jun's stunning achievement!</p><p>How young was she?</p><p>She wasn't even in the same league as Ye Laomo.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Ye Laomo stared blankly at Qing Jun, speechless.  It seemed he wasn't alone; Qing Jun's talent even surpassed his own. He sighed deeply, "Your aptitude is rare throughout history. But they weren't as fortunate as you; trapped in this cage, their lives wasted, ultimately turning to dust like ordinary mortals."</p><p>Qing Jun's cultivation stabilized. She summoned the Five Directions Pagoda, glancing at Ye Laomo. "You talk too much."</p><p>"The area opposite the Ascension Platform is unknown and surely dangerous. We can cooperate," Ye Laomo changed his plan, actively seeking an alliance with Qing Jun.</p><p>"You should worry about surviving first."</p><p>Qing Jun said indifferently.</p><p>Ye Laomo frowned.</p><p>Qing Jun flicked her finger.</p><p>A stream of light shot down, heading towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to scan it, discovering a message from Qing Jun and Bai.</p><p>Everyone's gaze was drawn to the light, their expressions varied.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed their curious stares.  Instead of concealing the light, he subtly displayed the message's contents.</p><p>Bai, Qing Jun, and his relationship were common knowledge.</p><p>Others would undoubtedly suspect they left him something before leaving, leading to future complications.</p><p>The writing floated in mid-air.</p><p>Everyone was startled, glancing gratefully at Qin Sang, eagerly reading the message.</p><p>At that moment, the outer hall's collapse accelerated; billowing smoke was already visible.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>"The outer hall is collapsing!  Run!"</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone snapped back to reality, hurriedly escaping on their flying swords.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted sharply.</p><p>The outer hall's destruction would also destroy the Ascension Platform!</p><p>This was something neither he nor Bai had anticipated.</p><p>Bai's message instructed him on how to reactivate the Ascension Platform, avoiding Ye Laomo's bloody methods, although the preparation was quite challenging.</p><p>Once Qin Sang's cultivation was sufficient, he could reactivate it.</p><p>Without the Heavenly Palace paving the way, the requirements for 'ascenders' were much higher.  Even Ye Laomo and Qing Jun, newly advanced powerful cultivators, might not be enough, but it was at least a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang didn't keep the message secret; sharing it didn't matter; everyone would rely on their own abilities.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even that last hope was gone!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression fluctuated, suddenly raising his head.</p><p>Most of the Heavenly Palace had sunk into the void.</p><p>A green light followed the Heavenly Palace into the void.</p><p>The moment the green light disappeared, Qin Sang and Qing Jun's eyes met across the distance, separated by realms, uncertain when they would meet again.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of loss.</p><p>Within the message.</p><p>Most of it was from Bai; Qing Jun left only two sentences.</p><p>"Junior Brother, Yuan Shen Gate is in your hands."</p><p>"I'll be waiting for you on the path ahead!"</p><p>(Volume Three End!)</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>1 Volume Four: "Green Silk," Coming Soon</p><p>2 This volume largely followed the outline, nothing much to say. Let me update you on my recent situation.</p><p>In May, I felt my health declining, so I adjusted my update schedule. Things improved somewhat, but my neck still bothered me, so I got it checked.</p><p>Wow!</p><p>Not only was my uric acid high, but my thyroid might also have problems.  I was stunned.</p><p>I, a Shandong man, lived for over twenty years before writing this book, never worrying about my health except for my own self-inflicted injuries!</p><p>After the Dragon Boat Festival, I took a leave, visiting several places, almost making the hospital my second home.</p><p>During that time, I forced myself to write, almost losing my motivation.</p><p>If I'd posted a chapter update then, it would have been filled with negativity.</p><p>Of course, since I'm sharing this now, it's good news!</p><p>Thankfully!</p><p>Thankfully!</p><p>It's confirmed, no major issues, rest will restore me.</p><p>When my mood improves, I eat and sleep well.  I slept for a day and night two days ago, then couldn't sleep last night from excitement.  My creativity flowed like a spring.</p><p>I finished the Dragon Boat Festival missing updates and the chapter for the alliance leader.</p><p>I'm going to have breakfast now and then get some proper sleep.</p><p>As usual, I'll take a break at the end of the volume, for one or two days.</p><p>My leave is ending, and I have a backlog of work and need to outline the next volume.  A single day may not be enough.</p><p>A request for votes wouldn't be too much, right? (To be continued)</p>
