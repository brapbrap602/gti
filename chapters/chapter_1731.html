<h1>Chapter 1722:  Illuminating a Realm</h1><p>Master Fa Zhao of Ganlu Temple issued a summons.</p><p>Not only the major sects of the Central Plains, but also the top sects of the Western Desert Buddhist schools, the Northern Wilderness demonic sects, and the Eastern Sea Immortal Isles received the personally drafted summons from Master Xingji.</p><p>The location was chosen at Guiyan Plateau, where the ruins of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect now serve as the headquarters of the Three Sects Alliance.</p><p>The news sent shockwaves through the cultivation world.</p><p>Finally, another True Monarch appeared, but it was unclear why they didn't join the Daoist sect and instead became associated with the Buddhist sect.</p><p>Further investigation revealed the truth.</p><p>The renowned Qingfeng Daoist was actually an external avatar of this Qin True Monarch!</p><p>After Qin Sang's breakthrough to the Nascent Divinity stage, there was no longer a need to conceal the relationship between his true body and avatar; those who had witnessed the Wuxiang Immortal Sect battle were already aware of some details.</p><p>Upon learning this, some were enlightened, others puzzled.</p><p>Qin True Monarch’s near demise during the pursuit by the Qinghu Saint King was well-known.</p><p>Some believed that the Hui Guang Saint and Ganlu Temple were clearing Qingfeng Daoist's name, acknowledging his contributions, protecting him, and sharing the pressure from the Qinghu Saint King.</p><p>Others questioned why only the external avatar received recognition for their merits.</p><p>Only those involved knew the true story. Outsiders could only speculate, but they guessed that a certain arrangement must have been made secretly between Hui Guang Saint, Qin True Monarch, and the Qinghu Saint King.</p><p>This invitation was considered Qin True Monarch's Nascent Divinity ascension ceremony.</p><p>The external avatar’s ascension ceremony to late-stage Nascent Soul was held at Ganlu Temple; now, the Nascent Divinity ceremony is at the Three Sects Alliance headquarters. This Qin True Monarch truly operates unconventionally.</p><p>The Three Sects Alliance is now a behemoth in the cultivation world, impossible to shake.</p><p>Various factions had hoped for a Nascent Divinity cultivator outside the Alliance to serve as a counterbalance, but instead, another True Monarch who is close to the Alliance has appeared.</p><p>Some lamented this, while others foresaw potential changes.</p><p>The invited factions, each with their own thoughts, prepared their congratulatory gifts and headed towards Guiyan Plateau.</p><p>A time of momentous events.</p><p>South Sea, a certain isolated island.</p><p>At the bottom of a valley on the island, light flickered, revealing two figures.</p><p>The arrivals were Qin Sang and Master Xingji.</p><p>In the valley, a young Buddhist monk and a young Daoist boy were meditating.  Seeing the Ganlu Temple abbot arrive, they quickly rose to greet him.</p><p>It turned out that there was an ancient teleportation array here, directly connecting to the South Sea. It was jointly managed by Buddhists and Daoists. It was usually opened only when entering the Immortal Palaces to save time, with one disciple from each sect guarding it daily.</p><p>The two left the island and continued south.</p><p>Master Xingji led the way until they reached the storm belt. After traveling for another fifteen minutes, Master Xingji stopped, pointing to the sea below. "Qin True Monarch, the two Immortal Palaces were located here.  They were connected, one named Tian Tong, the other Tian Xiang."</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, seeing nothing unusual.</p><p>Like the Qisha Hall and Ziwei Palace, the Immortal Palace in the Central State was also within the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, releasing his divine sense to sweep across the void and probe beneath the sea, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>While he searched, Master Xingji stood silently beside him, not daring to disturb him.</p><p>Once Qin Sang regained his composure, Master Xingji couldn't help but ask, "In this world, beyond the Abyss, are there truly Ascension Platforms?"</p><p>"I witnessed it with my own eyes, how could it be false?"</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, a hint of fatigue flashing across his expression. His divine sense had been heavily taxed.</p><p>Even after the Immortal Palace ascended, he still asked Master Xingji to bring him here, hoping, perhaps, that like the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, an Ascension Platform would be nearby.</p><p>Unfortunately, he found none.</p><p>After inquiring with Master Xingji, he learned that the Central State Immortal Palace differed greatly from the Ziwei Palace. There was no inner or outer palace. Even Nascent Divinity cultivators needed to be extremely cautious when entering the Immortal Palace, facing terrible dangers and unimaginable beings.</p><p>It sounded somewhat like the inner palace of the Qisha Hall.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace only revealed its wonder as an Immortal Palace at the moment of its ascension.</p><p>If the Central State Immortal Palace were placed between the Qisha Hall and Beichen Realm, cultivators would find it impossible to advance even a single step in the outer area, left only to sigh at the Immortal Palace.  The abundance of powerful cultivators in the Central State cultivation world allowed them to discover various immortal treasures and supreme cultivation techniques, and the Immortal Palace's blessings ensured their continued inheritance.</p><p>Even so, only a small portion has been explored over the years.</p><p>A black light flashed from Qin Sang's palm, revealing an iron chain.</p><p>After Shen Chen formed his Nascent Soul, he followed his master's instructions, diligently studying the art of refining artifacts and comprehending the fragments of the Fallen Iron Whip's Binding Demon Rope, restoring this treasure.</p><p>With a genuine Suppressing Demons Formation, repairing the Binding Demon Rope would be easier.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, Shen Chen had refined a Binding Demon Rope in just a few decades.</p><p>Although its power was inferior to the genuine Binding Demon Rope, and Qin Sang saw areas for improvement, it already possessed the ability to subdue demons, truly demonstrating his extraordinary talent.</p><p>Qin Sang felt relieved, passing on all his alchemic knowledge and collected texts to Shen Chen without reservation, and giving him the Jinchen Sword as encouragement.</p><p>He gently shook the Demon Binding Rope.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled obtaining the rope in a stone chamber within an ancient cultivator's relic; a powerful ancient demon was likely sealed inside.</p><p>He had also seen imitation Demon Binding Ropes at the Seven Killing Hall, probably crafted using fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Gui Mu's speculation that the external ancient demons and the Immortal Palace demon lords weren't aligned; perhaps, like her, their cultivation was also sealed below the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Upon awakening, these ancient demons would surely seek the Ascension Platforms.  Would they all risk traversing the storms and travel thousands of miles to the Northern Star Region?</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Ascension Platforms existed in other places like Central Plains, but unlike the one outside the Purple Micro Palace, they were hidden, awaiting activation by the ancient demons.</p><p>This gathering of various sects aimed to unite all forces in this world, searching every corner for Ascension Platforms to reopen the path to ascension!</p><p>Even ascension to the Demon Realm was better than remaining imprisoned.</p><p>This wasn't a sudden decision; before arriving, Qin Sang had already ordered the Dragon Whale Saint and other demon kings to have all demon tribes search the East Sea.</p><p>The two didn't stay long, returning to the Central Plains and heading straight for the Three Teach Alliance headquarters.</p><p>Sect Master Yu and the Eight Scenic Crane Ridge True Person He Gao were already waiting.</p><p>Sect Master Yu, fan in hand, looked more like a refined scholar than a demon lord. "I've long heard of Daoist Friend Qin's great name, yet we've never met.  To finally meet you, True Lord, truly lives up to your reputation!"</p><p>Sect Master Yu bowed deeply, his expression filled with admiration, then sighed, "Elder Fan is currently in seclusion, unable to greet the True Lord. Please forgive his absence."</p><p>True Person He Gao also bowed, ashamedly saying, "I had a fleeting glimpse of you that day, True Lord, and spoke rashly, offending you.  I deeply regret my words."</p><p>Both then presented jade slips.  "Master Xingji said that the True Lord seeks the techniques unearthed from the Immortal Palace. These are the accumulated knowledge of our two sects; please guide us, True Lord."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted them calmly, "Let's forget the past and look to the future."</p><p>The path to ascension was difficult, but Qin Sang wouldn't despair or stop.  His search for ancient techniques was to find any loopholes, using the Jade Buddha to find alternative paths, allowing him to rapidly increase his strength in this world.</p><p>They exchanged glances, their expressions softening.</p><p>Once Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense from the jade slips, they both bowed, "True Lord, with your heroic spirit, the Immortal Dao in this world is obstructed. What are your instructions?"</p><p>It turned out that Saint Hui Guang had already informed them of the impending calamity before his departure.  </p><p>That’s why the Three Teach Alliance exists.</p><p>For years, the Buddhist, Daoist, and Demon sects had stood in a three-legged stalemate, capable of conflict without collapse, thanks to a tacit understanding; none wanted to see the cultivation world descend into chaos.</p><p>They found it hard to believe, but Saint Hui Guang had shown them the indescribable Five Elements Crowned Demon Spirit, and recalling the scene of True Lord Zi Lei's tribulation, they had to believe.</p><p>"The effectiveness of the superior Soul-Subduing Incense varies from person to person. I can't guarantee its efficacy.  However, the matter of the Ascension Platform is undeniable..."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at True Person He Gao, "When we first met outside the storm zone, I was coming from the North Sea.  I didn't know of the ferocious beasts within, so reaching Central Plains was pure luck. I witnessed the Ascension Platform opening, with four people breaking through to another realm."</p><p>True Person He Gao sighed, his expression complex. "Alas, Heaven is blind! My senior brother was exceptionally gifted but born at an ill-fated time!"</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, various factions arrived as promised, gathering at the Ghost Rock Plateau.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't intended to hold a Nascent Soul Grand Ceremony, but Master Xingji took the initiative, organizing a celebration almost on par with the Zen Monastery's ancestor's Nascent Soul ceremony.</p><p>Unable to refuse such kindness, Qin Sang went along with it.</p><p>At the ceremony, Qin Sang appeared alongside the Qingyang Temple Abbot, Xie Family Head, and Loutai Temple Abbot.</p><p>It was Qingyang Temple's first appearance on the Central Plains stage, but only Abbot Shen appeared.  Shen Chen, remembering Qin Sang's teachings, spoke cautiously, aiming only to meet various heroes.</p><p>Compared to the top powers of Central Plains, Qingyang Temple was insignificant and needed to lie low.</p><p>At the ceremony, Qin Sang saw many familiar faces.</p><p>There was Hall Master Mu of the Six States Hall, one of the first to help Qin Sang search for the Ascension Platform, but the capabilities of a single merchant guild were limited; no valuable clues had been discovered.</p><p>There was Sect Master Situ Yu and Elder Lu Zhang of the Unforgettable Mountain.</p><p>Lu Zhang had broken through to the late stage of the Yuan Ying realm!</p><p>Reuniting with old friends, each having made progress, was a joyous occasion.</p><p>Representatives from the Seven Mirror Islands expressed satisfaction with their wise choice in inviting Daoist Qingfeng as a guest elder.</p><p>Others were less pleased.</p><p>For example, the Poison King, Sect Master of the Myriad Poisons Mountain, and the high monk from the Western Desert.</p><p>After the Grand Ceremony, Qin Sang dismissed the onlookers and led the heads of various sects and schools to the Sanjiao League's main hall.</p><p>Inside the hall, Qin Sang stood with his back to the crowd, hands behind his back.  Master Xingji, Sect Master Yu, True Person Hegao, and others stood respectfully beside him.  A pin could be heard dropping.</p><p>Most were bewildered, casting questioning glances at Qin Sang. They wondered what this Qin Zhenjun, who had unsettled the entire cultivation world, was planning.</p><p>"I once received a favor from a descendant of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, which led to my current achievements," Qin Sang said, turning around.  His first words caused an uproar.</p><p>Even if Xiao Xiangzi wasn't a direct descendant of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, he certainly had close ties, so Qin Sang's statement wasn't entirely false. The Buddha bone relic, the three Zhenling Incenses, and their formula had brought him tribulation, but also immense opportunities.  Otherwise, he wouldn't know when he would reach the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Over a hundred years ago, it was an ancient demon's subordinate, disguised as a descendant of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, who opened the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's legacy. They used the sect's name to release the sealed ancient demons, not any true descendant. The Wuxiang Immortal Sect's destruction stemmed from the demon calamity.  All its descendants were dedicated to slaying demons, but they were slandered by the ancient demon's subordinate and unjustly accused. Now that the ancient demon is gone and its subordinate eradicated, we must clear their name today."</p><p>This grand gathering notably lacked descendants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. They were understandably wary, with only Yan Yue Temple secretly sending gifts, too afraid to appear openly.</p><p>Qin Sang aimed to unite the Central Plains forces to search for the Ascension Platform, and the Wuxiang descendants were crucial.  They undoubtedly knew many secrets, now lost to the world.</p><p>One of his goals in resolving the internal strife amongst the demons was to allow them to unite and focus on this task.  Fortunately, the human race was relatively stable, requiring little of Qin Sang's attention. His tolerance of Master Xingji and inaction against the Sanjiao League were to avoid hindering the Ascension plan.</p><p>Qin Sang was a hero in slaying demons, making his words highly credible.  Moreover, some already suspected him of being a descendant of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>The crowd’s expressions varied.  Then, Master Xingji and the two others confirmed his words and took a joint oath, publicly clearing the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's name, finally resolving this long-standing case.</p><p>This alone wouldn't completely allay the descendants' fears, but it would alleviate their pressure and dispel some doubts, enabling them to move more freely.</p><p>The Wuxiang Immortal Sect's destruction was clearly more complex. What roles did Buddhism, Daoism, and the demonic arts play?  Qin Sang didn't delve deeper; history is best kept broad rather than detailed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang announced shocking news:  An Ascension Platform exists!  Even those at the late Nascent Soul stage, without needing to reach the Divine Transformation stage, have a chance to ascend!</p><p>Everyone was stunned, their intense gazes almost setting Qin Sang's robes ablaze.  The significance of the Ascension Platform needed no explanation. The late Nascent Soul stage was difficult, but far easier than Divine Transformation!</p><p>"The ferocious beasts are emerging; the changes in the Abyss are unknown.  Sage Huiguang and King Qinghu are traveling east, their fate uncertain. I will remain and seek other paths. After this meeting, I will journey to the Outer Lands, spreading this news, striving to unite the cultivators of this world in searching for the Ascension Platform.  With our combined efforts, we can find a way out for the cultivators of this realm!"</p><p>Qin Sang declared solemnly, "I swear before you all: I have personally witnessed someone ascending through the Ascension Platform in the Outer Lands. Unfortunately, I was unaware of the situation then, and the platform was destroyed unexpectedly.  However, I believe another one most likely exists in the Central Plains, and we need to search for it together."</p><p>"Breaking through the void is a near-certain death.  Can the Ascension Platform truly protect us?" someone asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "It offers a degree of protection.  For those at the late Nascent Soul stage, it's a nine-out-of-ten chance of death, but consider—isn't breaking through to Divine Transformation just as perilous?"  He recalled how Ye Laomo and others had used the Immortal Palace to withstand the spatial turbulence, but now they had only their own abilities to rely on.</p><p>"How many can the Ascension Platform hold? If it's destroyed after one use, won't we be working for someone else's benefit? What if someone finds the platform and keeps it secret?"  Another voiced their concerns directly.</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly, "The platform does have limitations, and activating it isn't easy.  Only I know how to activate it.  I will take those who contribute the most with me, leave behind the activation method, and the experience of withstanding the spatial turbulence before we go.  Lessons learned from last time ensure the platform won't be destroyed. I swear it before you all."</p><p>...</p><p>After answering many questions, Qin Sang moved to a side hall.  The main hall was still bustling.  Master Xingji and the others invited more people in, including the Poison King, Situ Yu, the heads of Longju Cave Heaven and Qiongying Gate—all top-tier experts, at the peak or nearing the peak of their cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Master Xingji, who then explained the Heavenly Demon Sound.  Qin Sang watched silently.  This was partly to urge them to search for the Ascension Platform, and partly to prevent unprepared individuals from attempting breakthroughs, causing needless casualties.  With adequate preparation, some might even survive the breakthrough to Divine Transformation and become his assistants.</p><p>If the Ascension Platform wasn't found, they would have to venture into the Abyss.  Those who subsequently reached the required cultivation would be informed.</p><p>Sage Huiguang and King Qinghu were eager, but Qin Sang, protected by the Jade Buddha, was in no rush. Qingyang Temple was still weak, relying on Luye. Regardless of the cultivation world's changes, its influence on his lineage was minimal, so he had fewer concerns.</p><p>Despite the impediment of the Demon Sound, the existence of the Ascension Platform offered hope, preventing these individuals from falling into despair and acting recklessly.</p><p>All for Ascension!</p><p>(End)</p>
