<h1>Chapter 1389: A Double-Edged Sword</h1><p>Qin Sang stood suspended in mid-air,</p><p>surrounded by demonic flames.</p><p>His gaze swept across Bi Fang, Feng Shangshi, and the man in white, his expression indifferent.</p><p>Bi Fang was stalled.</p><p>Feng Shangshi and Wa Yu vied for the lead.</p><p>This situation was deliberately created by Qin Sang to buy time, to keep them occupied and focused on each other.</p><p>Feng Shangshi rapidly closed in on the man in white, striking without hesitation.</p><p>The silk threads reappeared on his left arm.</p><p>But this time, it wasn't a single thread; a mass of silk formed itself into a square scroll.</p><p>Within the scroll, there was only a single image of a tornado; otherwise, it was empty, the background a pale blue, unclear whether it represented sky or sea.</p><p>The scroll seemed ethereal.</p><p>The tornado within the scroll spun faster and faster, until only a blurry vortex remained.</p><p>The void around the scroll began to distort, seemingly affected by the image within.</p><p>However, no other anomalies appeared elsewhere.</p><p>Seeing this, Wa Yu's face changed, muttering to himself, "Not good!"</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>As Wa Yu grew increasingly anxious, Feng Shangshi, eyes fixed on the man in white's back, uttered a single word!</p><p>The tornado burst from the painting.</p><p>The seemingly slender vortex emitted a deafening roar, shaking the earth.</p><p>In an instant, the tornado swelled to dozens of meters, passing over a stone mountain and obliterating the summit, leaving only a bare platform.</p><p>A streak of green light shot from the tornado, leaving trails of green shadows in the void.</p><p>Only when it neared the man in white could it be seen to be a wind cone.</p><p>A seemingly simple attack.</p><p>But the man in white had no way to avoid it!</p><p>In this critical moment, he resorted to his old trick, an ice shield appearing behind him, but this time it was different, seemingly the artifact's true form, creating a pale blue barrier.</p><p>The moment the ice shield appeared, the wind cone pierced through the air.</p><p>After a piercing screech of friction, the outer barrier of the ice shield was easily pierced by the wind cone.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The wind cone struck the main body of the ice shield, causing it to violently tremble.</p><p>The two forces clashed, producing a 'crack' sound, and two shocking cracks spread from the point of impact. A large chunk of the ice shield artifact shattered!</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The man in white was pierced in the chest by the wind cone's residual force, a bloody hole appearing. He spurted blood and fell to the ground.</p><p>However, his will to survive was incredibly strong. His wounded body staggered back to its feet, using his remaining strength to flee.</p><p>Feng Shangshi seemed to sense something and frowned slightly. But before he could think further, Wa Yu couldn't hold back any longer and attacked him.</p><p>The man in white, severely injured and at his wit's end, was no longer a threat. Wa Yu's aim was to prevent him from falling into Feng Shangshi's hands.</p><p>Emerald green light obscured Feng Shangshi's vision, the surrounding space becoming stagnant.</p><p>Feng Shangshi snorted coldly and tapped the scroll.</p><p>A new tornado appeared within the scroll.</p><p>This time, however, it didn't manifest as a wind cone, but like a whirlwind, scattering the green light and allowing his figure to merge with the vortex, speeding forward.</p><p>Wa Yu knew Feng Shangshi was a formidable opponent, and seeing this, he gnashed his teeth, a guttural 'gurgling' sound escaping his throat as he spat out a green pill.</p><p>It resembled a妖丹 (yao dan), or perhaps some kind of treasure.</p><p>As soon as the pill appeared, the green light stabilized and intensified.</p><p>The man and the demon displayed their respective abilities, engaging in a fierce struggle, but still rapidly closing in on the man in white.</p><p>As for Qin Sang himself.</p><p>While seemingly using all his strength to unleash demonic fire against Bi Fang, it was mostly a bluff. Most of his energy was focused on sensing the distant Yuan Ying talisman puppet and the Sky-Eyed Butterflies.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the deserted island.</p><p>As the strong cultivators pursued the man in white.</p><p>Hong Shu frantically fled, finally spotting the storm zone, a swirling tempest resembling a curtain of heaven, and plunged into it.</p><p>'Whew!'</p><p>Hong Shu let out a long sigh of relief, his eyes darting around.</p><p>Entering the chaotic storm zone would completely erase his tracks; even if those people pursued him, they wouldn't be able to find him.</p><p>Just then, a struggle appeared in Hong Shu's eyes, the turmoil more intense than before.</p><p>"Don't worry! In a little while, I will treat you well, repay you for the long chase!"</p><p>Hong Shu muttered to himself, his tone icy cold.</p><p>At this moment, Hong Shu had been possessed by the man in white, his body taken over!</p><p>With so many experts drawn to the deserted island, the man in white knew that relying solely on his own strength, there was absolutely no chance of escape. He had already despaired, but unexpectedly discovered that Hong Shu was inexplicably weakened.</p><p>An idea struck the man in white, and he saw a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Following his plan, he used ice boxes and spirit formations to distract others, while he himself decisively abandoned his physical body. His primordial spirit, following the connection of the mark, accurately located the main body of the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>Such tracking techniques are a double-edged sword.  Especially when the caster is weak, they can easily become a death warrant.  Previously, when Old Mou and Qin Sang had a much larger difference in cultivation, Old Mou used similar spells to hunt Qin Sang, only to be killed by Qin Sang using the fire spell seed to lock onto his remnant soul.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat's main body hadn't fully transformed and was weak, making it easy prey for the man in white.  However, the Rainbow Rat never expected the man in white to still have the power to fight back.</p><p>The man in white forcibly possessed the Rainbow Rat, suppressing its consciousness and taking control.  He secretly sent messages to Bi Fang and the other demons, misleading them towards his own physical body.  Bi Fang, unsuspecting, fell for the trick.  The man in white, controlling the Rainbow Rat's body, escaped.</p><p>If it weren't for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, the man in white would have succeeded.  He only needed to reach safety before dealing with the Rainbow Rat, achieving both revenge and escape.</p><p>"Who?!"</p><p>The man in white, possessing the Rainbow Rat's body, his sharp beak twisting into a strange smile, froze abruptly, turning sharply.  Behind him stood a mysterious figure in black robes.</p><p>The man in white felt a chill run down his spine.  The black-robed figure had appeared behind him without him noticing.  His seemingly flawless plan had been exposed.</p><p>He noticed this person wasn't the Yuan Ying cultivator who appeared on the barren mountain. Could there be a third party lurking outside the island, waiting for their prey?</p><p>"No!  It's not!"</p><p>The man in white forced himself to remain calm, finally noticing something. "It's not a cultivator, it's a puppet!"</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, the man in white felt a gust of wind approaching and hastily dodged.</p><p>This was nearly the limit of Qin Sang's perception, so he could only send the most direct commands through the soul mark. Having just been hunted, he had no patience for the Beihai demons.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet, without a word, attacked directly.</p><p>The man in white was startled and dodged frantically.  However, possessing the Rainbow Rat while suppressing its consciousness had left him with little strength. He was no match for the Yuan Ying puppet, and was immediately in grave danger.</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>A large hand burst forth from the air.</p><p>Just as he was about to be disemboweled, a white shadow flashed from the Rainbow Rat, seeming not to be a Yuan Ying cultivator, but a phantom spirit.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A thunderbolt suddenly struck.</p><p>Seeing the spirit trying to escape, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly intervened.</p><p>The spirit was terrified and quickly retreated back into the Rainbow Rat's body.</p><p>"劫雷!" (Jie Lei - Heavenly Tribulation Thunder)</p><p>The man in white was utterly shocked, blurting out the words, instantly regretting it.</p>
