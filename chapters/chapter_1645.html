<h1></h1><p>Along with the Avatar's voice, the roar of the ferocious beast, the Horned Serpent, also resounded.</p><p>Its might overshadowed the Thousand-Zhang Giant Crocodile!</p><p>The Thousand-Zhang Giant Crocodile below, the Horned Serpent above, both ferocious and unmatched.</p><p>The Ice Lake seemed to have transformed into an ancient battlefield of ferocious beasts.</p><p>Without a word, the Avatar directly summoned the spiritual treasure, the Four-Carriage Horned Serpent Seal. He didn't approach the Strange-Faced Man at all, giving no opportunity for the Jade Beetle to ambush.</p><p>With a subtle thought, the Horned Serpent, treading on cold flames, descended from the sky.  It didn't charge directly at the Strange-Faced Man, but instead cut him off from the Spirit Weeping Cave Master!</p><p>……</p><p>Banners lined the Ice Lake.</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master was pulled into the banner formation and disappeared from the Strange-Faced Man’s sight.</p><p>Azure celestial light and icy winds encircled the banner formation; the remnants of the formation's power were not to be underestimated.</p><p>The only flaw was that as the banner formation's momentum grew stronger, the flickering of the residual banner shadows became more and more pronounced. Soon, the first residual banner shadow exploded and dissipated.</p><p>The dissipation of a residual banner shadow indicated that the corresponding broken banner within the formation eye could no longer be maintained and had been destroyed.</p><p>The second banner, the third banner…</p><p>The broken banners were destroyed one after another.</p><p>Before the banner formation's power could reach its peak, it began to decline.</p><p>One by one, the illusory shadows of the broken banners vanished from the formation.</p><p>The destruction of each banner created a flaw in the formation, which could easily become a fatal vulnerability. Because of this, even if he successfully controlled the Ice Palace Grand Formation and executed his ambush, Qin Sang wouldn’t have much time.</p><p>Conversely, for the Spirit Weeping Cave Master, this was his hope of escape!</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s cries for help were cut short, the latter half swallowed by the banner formation.</p><p>The battle situation changed in an instant. The Spirit Weeping Cave Master felt a sudden shift in the wind and clouds around him. When he regained his senses, the outside scenery had vanished, leaving only layers upon layers of boundless azure celestial light and icy wind.</p><p>Faint banner shadows surrounded him, spinning incessantly, leaving no gaps.</p><p>The encircling banner shadows spun faster and faster.</p><p>All the banner shadows rapidly closed in on the Spirit Weeping Cave Master, killing intent pressing down upon him.  Precariously situated, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master could only rely on himself; he couldn’t place all his hope on the Strange-Faced Man.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master was currently locked onto by the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand.</p><p>At this moment, the red flower magical treasure he had recalled shone with a vibrant red light once again, the beautiful red flower looking as though it had been watered with blood.</p><p>The red flower hung upside down, its corolla pointed at the Spirit Weeping Cave Master himself. A crimson beam of light shot straight down, enveloping him.</p><p>This treasure had protected its master numerous times.  Despite most of the evil spirits being annihilated by the sword formation, it still possessed considerable power.</p><p>Bathed in the red light, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master's expression eased slightly. The icy煞 of the banner formation was blocked by the red light, unable to approach him, and the suction force also weakened.</p><p>He finally regained his footing, but didn't rashly attempt to break through the formation. Instead, he crossed his hands before his chest, his fingers manipulating spiritual threads, drawing several complex runes in the air.</p><p>The runes were composed of tadpole-like lines, their meaning obscure.</p><p>As the Spirit Weeping Cave Master repeatedly tapped the void, all the runes collided, splitting and recombining. The broken parts reconnected, but their shape was entirely different from before, eventually forming a distorted rune diagram.</p><p>The edges of the rune diagram were jagged, but the interior depicted a human figure trapped within, constantly writhing.</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master repeated this process, creating four such rune diagrams, positioned in the four directions around him.  Their forms were largely similar, differing only in subtle details.</p><p>The four rune diagrams were linked by their Qi.</p><p>After completing the rune diagrams, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master spread his right hand wide. True Essence boiled within his palm, transforming into four streaks of light that shot towards the four rune diagrams.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>……</p><p>The rune diagrams, having just taken shape, exploded one after another.  Then, a ghostly shadow darted out from the fragments.</p><p>As the ghostly shadows appeared, a sinister Qi permeated the area.  They were incredibly evil Yin Demons, far surpassing the evil spirits the Spirit Weeping Cave Master had previously released.</p><p>However, despite years of cultivation and expending vast resources, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master had only managed to cultivate four Yin Demons, far fewer than the evil spirits.</p><p>The number of Yin Demons wasn’t necessarily a matter of "the more, the better."</p><p>These inherently murderous beings lacked sentience. Even the Spirit Weeping Cave Master, who had personally refined them, usually needed to use secret techniques to seal them.</p><p>He would only release them when absolutely necessary, and they had to be recalled after a short period. Otherwise, it would be hard to say whether the Yin Demons would slay enemies or devour their master.</p><p>Freed from the rune diagrams, the Yin Demons let out shrill howls, their forms twisting and turning as they coiled around the Spirit Weeping Cave Master.  The gazes they directed at their master held no subservience, resembling more the predatory stare of a hunter. Their expressions were even more bizarre, shifting between eerie smiles and ferocious snarls.</p><p>A flush crept up the Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s face.</p><p>His internal injuries hadn’t fully healed, but he couldn’t afford to care about them now. He immediately suppressed his surging blood Qi, silently activating a demon-suppressing technique. Pointing at the banner formation, he growled, “Go!”</p><p>The Yin Demons shuddered, seemingly reluctant.</p><p>But their movements were not the least bit hesitant. They all obediently followed the Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s command, turning to pounce on the banner shadows, attempting to destroy the formation.</p><p>The banner formation had already been activated, transformed into a killing formation that would not let anyone escape.</p><p>As soon as the Yin Demons rushed out of the range of the red light, the remaining intact banner shadows blazed with brilliant light, connecting with the heavens. Several streaks of azure celestial light instantly transformed into sharp swords, shooting towards the Yin Demons.</p><p>Seeing this, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s expression remained unchanged.  He slightly hooked his finger.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Almost simultaneously, the four Yin Demons were pierced by the azure celestial light.  Some even attracted multiple attacks. The menacing Yin Demons froze in place.</p><p>Then, they vanished into thin air.</p><p>They were all afterimages!</p><p>Further away, shadows flowed and coalesced. The Yin Demons reappeared, their dark bodies showing no signs of injury; they were ethereal beings.</p><p>With a sudden pounce, the Yin Demons seized the opportunity to pass through several banner shadows, appearing above the banner formation, where the azure celestial light was most concentrated.</p><p>This was precisely one of the vulnerabilities of the formation!</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master closely watched the Yin Demons’ movements. Seeing them successfully infiltrate, his eyes lit up. He immediately commanded them to attack with full force.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The Yin Demons surged forward, seemingly chaotic, yet their movements followed a hidden pattern, leaving trails of afterimages behind.</p><p>It appeared as though all their attacks landed on empty space, but the banner shadows within the formation trembled far more violently than before.  Where they struck, the celestial light tore, faintly showing signs of forming voids.</p><p>Under the Yin Demons' relentless assault, the vulnerabilities in the formation were widening, but the Spirit Weeping Cave Master still felt it was too slow. He formed hand seals.</p><p>"Coalesce!"</p><p>The Yin Demons froze, reluctantly turning their heads to look at each other, emitting unwilling shrieks, yet they were helpless.  They lunged at their companions, beginning to merge and coalesce.</p><p>Their nature was greedy and murderous. If their master allowed them to devour each other, they wouldn’t hesitate, but this fusion was not their desire.</p><p>As the Yin Demons coalesced, the blood Qi within the Spirit Weeping Cave Master began to surge again.</p><p>The four Yin Demons transformed into a mass of black, sinister shadow. The shadow writhed, contracting inwards, then stretching and deforming in some areas, finally taking the form of a demonic beast that resembled a canine, yet wasn’t quite.</p><p>The Yin Demon beast had thick limbs and stood nearly a hundred Zhang tall. Although not as large as the Thousand-Zhang Giant Crocodile, it was still a terrifying creature that would instill fear in anyone outside.</p><p>It raised its head towards the sky, its four hooves stomping heavily on the void. A whimpering sound escaped its mouth as it opened wide, a ball of black, sinister light coalescing within. Aiming at the nascent void, it unleashed a furious blast!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sinister light surged into the void.</p><p>A circular black hole appeared amidst the azure celestial light.</p><p>Sinister Qi emanated from the black hole, expanding and permeating outwards. The Yin Demon beast continued its assault, spewing demonic light without pause.</p><p>The power of the banner formation immediately became chaotic.</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master spread his left palm, summoning the wooden thorn.  Simultaneously, he controlled the red flower magical treasure, condensing the beam of light and slamming it into the center of the suction force.</p><p>Restrictions flickered in the void, but none could withstand the wooden thorn, shattering one after another.</p><p>He was about to carve out an escape route from the banner formation.</p><p>A hint of joy just flickered in the Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s eyes when, for some unknown reason, a sense of unease washed over him.  Through the banner shadows, he saw a mass of black demonic fire.</p><p>The demonic fire blazed fiercely.</p><p>Behind the demonic fire, a human figure faintly appeared, reflected in the Spirit Weeping Cave Master's eyes, deeply piercing his gaze.</p><p>At this moment, a premonition of impending doom suddenly gripped the Spirit Weeping Cave Master.  A chill ran from the soles of his feet up his spine to the top of his head, his hairs standing on end!</p><p>A demonic fire dragon roared towards him, emanating terrifying fluctuations.</p><p>It was Qin Sang’s true body, having bypassed the poisonous light, arriving and unleashing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire towards the banner formation with a flick of his sleeve.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The demonic fire rushed towards him.</p><p>Before the fire dragon even arrived, the aura of the demonic fire caused the blood within the Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s body to almost solidify. A cry of alarm escaped his throat as he opened his mouth and spewed a cloud of white light.</p><p>A string of white jade prayer beads appeared within the white light.</p><p>As soon as the prayer beads appeared, they detached from the string, scattering in all directions in an instant. It was a set of formation tools.</p><p>The bead shadows swayed, white light flashing, forming the illusory image of a jade wall.</p><p>This was a set of defensive formation tools with considerable power.  While releasing the Yin Demons, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master had secretly activated this set of tools, but kept them hidden until now.</p><p>Even mortals knew the strategy of striking an enemy halfway across the river. The Spirit Weeping Cave Master was well aware that unless the Strange-Faced Man could hold back the enemy, he would definitely encounter resistance the moment he broke out of the formation, hence his preparations.</p><p>Just as the jade wall was about to fully form,</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master suddenly heard a ‘hum ha’ sound. The strange sound appeared without warning, penetrating his eardrums and resonating within his Purple Mansion.  He felt as though his Nascent Soul had been pierced by a sharp awl, the pain unbearable. He groaned involuntarily.</p><p>Qin Sang had focused on cultivating the 《Fire Seed Golden Lotus》 for many years, and his divine sense was already formidable. Coupled with the divine sense treasure, the Thousand-Knot Divine Net, the power of his Soul Capturing Mantra was now unparalleled.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>With his Nascent Soul in excruciating pain, how could the Spirit Weeping Cave Master concentrate on controlling the formation? The nearly formed jade wall trembled violently, the prayer beads scattering.</p><p>With a ‘boom,’ the remaining illusory image of the jade wall, along with the white jade beads, were swept away by the demonic fire dragon as if they were nothing, unable to offer the slightest resistance.</p><p>Facing imminent doom, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master had no time to cast other spells.  Moreover, he hadn’t yet escaped the banner formation; Nascent Soul projection would also be a dead end.</p><p>His face was filled with terror, his bloodshot eyes darting around frantically.</p><p>His tangible blood-red gaze fell upon the Yin Demon beast above.  Simultaneously, blood continuously gushed from his eye sockets, forming blood threads that crawled across his face like living creatures, spreading across his entire body.</p><p>In an instant, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master was covered in a net of blood.</p><p>The blood began to burn, fierce blood flames engulfing him.</p><p>The Yin Demon beast's roar suddenly became shrill. Its body curled into a ball, transforming into a streak of sinister light that poured into the Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s crown.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s neck craned upwards, his veins bulging, as he let out an inhuman roar.</p><p>Then, the sinister light flowed through his body along with the blood flames. The Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s flesh and blood began to grow wildly, his skin bulging, his muscles expanding.</p><p>Amidst the sinister light and blood flames, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master vanished, transformed into a horrifying monster, barely resembling a human. Only his head remained unchanged, seemingly embedded in a mass of rotting flesh.</p><p>This was the Soul Burning Ghost Curse, fusing the Yin Demon with oneself, granting terrifying power in an instant.</p><p>However, this curse carried immense hidden dangers and could only be used in life-or-death situations.  Since learning the Soul Burning Ghost Curse, this was the first time the Spirit Weeping Cave Master had used it to save himself.</p><p>Transformed into a monster, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master leaped upwards, attempting to smash through the banner formation.</p><p>Through the layers of banner shadows, Qin Sang’s Heavenly Eye witnessed the gruesome transformation of the Spirit Weeping Cave Master. His pupils constricted, but his movements remained fluid, the speed of the demonic fire actually increasing!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The demonic fire dragon engulfed the blood flames, colliding fiercely with the monster.</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master had too little time; the transformation wasn’t truly complete.</p><p>Flesh and blood exploded like fireworks, scattering everywhere. Among them was the Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s head, half of which was incinerated by the demonic fire.</p><p>Only a section of cervical bone remained attached to the head as it spun upwards, dripping with blood, before being consumed by the demonic fire.</p><p>In his final moments, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s eyes were ashen, offering no resistance as he was burned to ashes.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed slightly.  He changed his hand seals, and the demonic fire suddenly dispersed, transforming into a sea of flames. Simultaneously, he deployed the Golden Sinking Sword, creating a net of swords to destroy every fragment of flesh and blood.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly stunned.</p><p>The Spirit Weeping Cave Master’s Nascent Soul was nowhere to be seen, truly destroyed along with his physical body.</p><p>One of Qin Sang's objectives in pulling his opponent into the formation was to prevent the escape of his Nascent Soul, eliminating the possibility of future trouble.</p><p>He surmised that his opponent, knowing full well that Nascent Soul projection would only delay the inevitable, and that capture would mean eternal damnation, chose to merge with the Yin Demon in a desperate gamble.</p><p>Scanning the empty banner formation,</p><p>For some reason, Qin Sang still felt uneasy. The Spirit Weeping Cave Master's actions seemed too decisive.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression shifted slightly. He withdrew the demonic fire and sword formation, escaping outwards.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>The Ice Lake was completely frozen.</p><p>Having lost its target, the Thousand-Zhang Giant Crocodile was restless.</p><p>The surroundings were in ruins, countless palaces collapsed.</p><p>The remnants of the formation were on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The azure celestial light hung low, threatening to crumble at any moment. The power of the spirit formations in other areas of the Ice Instrument Palace had greatly diminished. The Strange-Faced Man, pursued by Qin Sang’s Avatar, was escaping outwards.  Wrapped around his right wrist was a wisp of blood Qi – a living evil spirit!</p><p>Suddenly, the pain on the evil spirit’s face vanished. Its features twisted, transforming into the likeness of the Spirit Weeping Cave Master.</p><p>Even facing mortal danger, the Spirit Weeping Cave Master hadn’t forgotten to leave a contingency plan. When the red flower generated evil spirits to form a blood river against the Seven Souls Killing Formation, he had secretly released dozens of evil spirits amidst the chaos.</p><p>Most of the evil spirits were destroyed by the residual energy, but this one survived.</p><p>He never imagined he would truly perish here. A habitual precaution became his only hope.  Sensing the surviving evil spirit, he was overjoyed.  While seemingly fighting desperately, he secretly employed a secret technique, using the spirit for rebirth.</p><p>The evil spirit, its face filled with malice, realized its predicament, its expression stiffening.  Then it heard the Strange-Faced Man’s sinister voice.</p><p>“Cornered in a dead end, the Cave Master still had the means for Spirit Rebirth. I admire you! However, that man’s divine abilities are formidable, and he can control the Ice Palace Grand Formation. If I hadn’t intervened to preserve this evil spirit, do you think you could have escaped?”</p>
