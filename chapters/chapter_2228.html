<h1>Chapter 2218: Linghuan</h1><p>The fluctuation of the Heavenly Tribulation drew everyone's attention.</p><p>The area around Liuli's cave had become a sea of mist, thick fog obscuring the sky and blocking prying eyes.</p><p>The dense fog was created by a spirit array, a formation personally set up by Qin Sang.  Its power was considerable; even with the use of spiritual vision techniques, others would struggle to see through it in a short time.</p><p>Hidden within the array, Qin Sang felt numerous gazes upon him and felt a surge of anxiety.</p><p>Logically, everyone was busy vying for positions on the sacred mountain and would not pay attention to a mere Nascent Soul cultivator. After all, even if Liuli successfully passed her tribulation, it wouldn't affect the overall situation.  He feared someone with ulterior motives might deliberately stir up trouble.</p><p>Meteors continued to fall, but his physical body remained motionless, guarding against any unforeseen events.</p><p>Fortunately, things went as he expected. Most of the gazes quickly retreated. Even if some were curious about the cultivator undergoing the tribulation, during this crucial time of vying for positions on the sacred mountain, they didn’t want to cause complications.</p><p>“It seems that Fairy Liuli has broken through the bottleneck.  Master Ning and your efforts were not in vain,” the Yuanxiang clan leader congratulated him.</p><p>“The Heavenly Tribulation hasn't arrived yet, there are still variables!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be overly optimistic. Looking up at the moon, he transmitted a message back, “This illusory realm is about to change. Pay attention to the celestial changes. During the struggle for positions, it may become a decisive advantage…”</p><p>He then shared all his knowledge of the illusory realm with the Yuanxiang clan leader.</p><p>The rising moon signaled a subtle shift within the illusory realm. As power surged within, those within would have their minds affected by illusions, potentially losing themselves within them.</p><p>Among the cultivators present, there were many top-tier experts who wouldn't easily fall into such illusions.  However, even if they could resist the power of the illusory realm, their battles would inevitably be affected. If their opponents seized the opportunity, they could instantly determine victory or defeat.</p><p>Qin Sang was waiting for this moment.  He knew his forces were limited, but he didn't want to simply choose a treasure carelessly. This was because he understood the illusory realm; by taking advantage of this knowledge, even against powerful opponents, he had a chance to turn the tide.</p><p>“Oh? The moon holds such a secret! If that's the case, I can strive for a higher position!”</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader’s eyes gleamed.</p><p>At this time, some people noticed the crescent moon in the sky, but they hadn't yet discovered its influence on the illusory realm. They merely considered it a normal celestial phenomenon.</p><p>…</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The mountain where Liuli’s cave was located suddenly split open, as if someone had cleaved it in two with a sword, from the summit to the base, revealing her cave.</p><p>She sat calmly on a stone, dressed in white, her temperament ethereal.</p><p>A biting chill emanated from Liuli, the energy radiating from her body transforming into wind and snow, freezing the cave.</p><p>As the mountain split, the chill spread, a layer of frost visible to the naked eye covering the rocks and land, rapidly expanding outwards.</p><p>'Plop plop plop…'</p><p>The sky was filled with white, snowflakes swirling.</p><p>The snowflakes initially fell like goose down, but eventually became as large as washbasins, incredibly heavy, relentlessly pounding the ground.  The surrounding mountains were quickly covered with a blanket of snow. The vegetation on the mountains was frozen into ice under the frost and then buried under the blizzard, life extinguished.</p><p>Liuli seemed oblivious to everything around her.  Her eyes were closed, her internal energy unusually chaotic, as if engaged in a fierce internal battle. However, Qin Sang could discern some clues; the chaos was orderly, and Liuli was gradually gaining the upper hand.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang’s thoughts stirred, the Qianjun Ring glowed, and a bronze ancient lamp flew out — the Wu Ran Heart Lamp left by Master Leichen before his departure.</p><p>The lamp emitted a bloody light; the lamp stand overflowed with blood, the essence of Master Leichen.</p><p>Qin Sang closely monitored the changes in Liuli and the moon in the sky, prepared to light the Wu Ran Heart Lamp at any moment.</p><p>The illusory realm not only infiltrated Liuli’s demon tribulation but also interfered with her three calamities, the latter clearly being detrimental to her. The Wu Ran Heart Lamp, however, could help her withstand external influences.</p><p>…</p><p>At the sacred mountain.</p><p>Assured that no one would interfere with Liuli’s tribulation, Qin Sang relaxed, focusing on deciding which stone platform to claim.</p><p>“Master Qin, do you have a preferred item?”  The Yuanxiang clan leader asked through a voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that the Yuanxiang clan leader hadn't acted yet, firstly because they hadn't yet chosen a target, and secondly because they were waiting for him.</p><p>To outsiders, he and the Yuanxiang clan leader were allies.  If he acted before the Yuanxiang clan leader, others might be wary of the Zhuyan clan's strength and dare not compete with him.</p><p>Qin Sang appreciated the Yuanxiang clan leader's good intentions, expressed his gratitude via voice transmission, then his physical body soared into the air, shooting towards the sacred mountain.</p><p>Several shooting stars fell from the sky simultaneously, landing at various heights.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fixed on one in particular. After careful consideration, he chose this treasure.</p><p>The star contained a key, ancient in design and made of bronze. It lacked a bright glow, but a small, round jade pendant hung from its end. One side was inscribed with the character 'Ling', the other with 'Huan'.</p><p>The Yi people called it the Linghuan Key, the key to the Linghuan Jade Realm.</p><p>Legend says the Linghuan Jade Realm was created by an Yi ancestor, a sacred training ground where cultivation was said to be twice as effective.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. He didn't lack cultivation techniques or even innate spiritual treasures; what he lacked was cultivation time. He had grasped the essence of his techniques, but hadn't had sufficient time to cultivate.</p><p>However, the Linghuan Jade Realm was a second-best choice.</p><p>Qin Sang's astral projection surveyed several stone platforms near the summit, taking in several treasures, including the Feiling Waterfall.</p><p>He wasn't particularly interested in the Feiling Waterfall. His Yunyoud Sword had already transformed into an innate spiritual treasure, and Xiao Wu didn't lack spiritual essence. The waterfall could only enhance spiritual treasures like the Huying Sword, which weren't crucial to him. He could always find better ones later.</p><p>He was far more interested in something else: on one platform, a crimson fire glowed with a faint purple light.  A shooting star contained a purple jade bottle holding three Purple Rhyme Heavenly Lotus Pills!</p><p>These pills were worth no less than the Feiling Waterfall, among the finest rewards of the trial.</p><p>These pills were renowned among the Yi people; they directly enhanced cultivation!</p><p>Among those present, only a handful of cultivators had reached the peak of the late stages and were on the verge of a breakthrough. This seemingly small step could take hundreds or even thousands of years of arduous cultivation. Refining a Purple Rhyme Heavenly Lotus Pill would allow one to leap directly to the threshold, allowing them to focus on the breakthrough to the Saint Realm.  This alone made them incredibly desirable, and they had other benefits as well!</p><p>Entering the Linghuan Jade Realm required further cultivation, and it had a drawback: the length of time one could remain varied greatly. Some could stay for hundreds of years and reap rich rewards; others might only last three to five years, their gains far outweighed by their efforts.</p><p>This was reportedly due to instability within the Jade Realm, perhaps a deliberate test left by the ancestor. The longer one stayed, the greater the pressure, hindering cultivation.</p><p>This made the Linghuan Jade Realm less valuable than treasures like the Purple Rhyme Heavenly Lotus Pills, but still a second-tier prize.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the nature of this drawback, but it could be several things. If it was external interference, he had the Thunder Beast Guards to protect him; if it was a mental demon, he had nothing to fear.</p><p>Of course, compared to the Jade Realm, Qin Sang preferred the Purple Rhyme Heavenly Lotus Pills, but the situation prevented him from obtaining them.</p><p>The pills were located too high.  The strong clans from the Mist Sea were eyeing them covetously. The ancestor's disciples had split into several groups, clearly aiming to focus their strength on the highest platforms.</p><p>Even using his illusionary realm, Qin Sang could hardly contend with them. The Linghuan Key offered a chance.</p><p>The platform holding the Key was also close to the summit. Qin Sang's movement immediately drew many eyes.</p><p>By this point, he had entered the competitive zone of the stronger clans. A human cultivator daring to covet the Linghuan Key!</p><p>As Qin Sang moved, the Yuanxiang Clan Chief also made his choice; he targeted a platform where a strand of crystalline silk, known as Star Gold Crystal, had fallen.  This enhanced the Yi people's innate abilities.</p><p>Most of the rewards were similar to the Star Gold Crystal – treasures for the Yi people, but useless to outsiders – leaving Qin Sang with few options.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions sparked suspicion. He had been with the Zhuyan Clan, and was considered part of their faction. What was his ulterior motive?</p><p>Yuan Ren and the others watched him intently, ready to spring into action, intensifying the suspicion. If someone was planning to target the Zhuyan, and Qin Sang diverted their strength, the Zhuyan would gain the upper hand.</p><p>But if they ignored him, would they let a human cultivator succeed?</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan Chief let out a long howl and soared towards the Star Gold Crystal, further confusing everyone.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>A sudden shriek came from below, trembling with fear.</p><p>Everyone looked down. The shouter was one of the ancestor's disciples.</p><p>Yu Zhen, his friend, looked utterly flustered.  "Why are you so alarmed? Who is this person?" asked the man beside him, puzzled.</p><p>Yu Zhen ignored him, darting to a black-robed cultivator.  "Qi Xiong," he urgently asked, "you, Si Daoyou, and Tang… you three ambushed a human cultivator. Si Daoyou and Tang… they both died. Was it him?"</p><p>The black-robed cultivator was indeed the Qi cultivator who had participated in the ambush of Qin Sang.</p><p>Seized by Yu Zhen, he was bewildered and confused.  The two immortals had vanished without a trace, their fate uncertain; he’d already told Yu Zhen everything. Why did Yu Zhen seem to only just now learn of it?</p><p>"What? Si Daoyou and Tang… are dead? And killed by this man?"</p><p>"Qi Xiong was there too? Three against one, and they were killed?  That's unbelievable!"</p><p>"It's more than that.  During that time,  Bing Xianzi and Yan Xianzi were also with Qi Xiong…"</p><p>…</p><p>Those previously uninformed were utterly shocked, their gazes upon Qin Sang filled with awe and fear.</p><p>Among the elders and disciples present, none had close relatives or friends among the dead. Even prior acquaintances wouldn't be motivated to avenge them.</p><p>Instead, Qin Sang's exploits were far too stunning, causing an uproar.</p><p>Countless questioning eyes converged.  Faced with the crowd’s inquiries, before Yu Zhen, the Qi cultivator couldn't deny it.  With a grim expression, he said, "Si and Tang are indeed missing, but given their strength, they wouldn't fall so easily.  They must be trapped somewhere, in a hidden realm.  And this person…"</p><p>He hesitated. He wanted to mention Qin Sang's accomplice, but revealing that the accomplice was only at the early stage of the Void Refinement realm would only embolden Qin Sang.</p><p>The crowd exchanged glances. The Qi cultivator didn’t deny it—the ambush was real!  Whether the two were alive or dead, the failed ambush was certain.  They were missing, and the culprit stood before them, yet the Qi cultivator made no mention of revenge.</p><p>This Qin Zhenren's strength…</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Someone gasped, their gaze upon Qin Sang filled with fear.</p><p>Those who had previously harbored intentions of testing Qin Sang now abandoned the thought.</p><p>From the Mist Sea, having learned the truth, similar expressions of astonishment appeared.</p><p>The Mermaid Queen and the Feather-People Prince exchanged a secret glance.  They thought to themselves,  "No wonder Hong Tian values this outsider so highly."</p><p>Only Zhan Yan and his group knew about Qin Sang and Yu Zhen’s prior connection.</p><p>Zhan Yan felt disdain but was secretly startled. Regardless, Qin Sang's exploits were likely true. He squeezed the jade slip in his hand, choosing not to expose the truth.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously used Zhang Yan as leverage, ensuring they wouldn't cause trouble.  Rescuing Zhang Yan meant a great reward from his sect upon their return, benefitting Zhan Yan and his associates.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang ascended the stone platform. Seeing Yu Zhen's actions, he couldn't help but laugh and cry.  He hadn’t instructed Yu Zhen to do this; it was entirely Yu Zhen’s initiative.  But he had to admit, the effect was excellent. Sometimes, a little high-profile publicity wasn’t a bad thing.</p><p>Standing on the platform, Qin Sang looked down at the mountain, awaiting competitors, yet found no worthy opponents.</p><p>Qin Sang had fought five strong cultivators, killed two, and escaped unscathed. To deal with him, at least six powerful cultivators would be needed.  Moreover, Qin Sang wasn’t alone; aside from the Zhu Yan clan, Hong Yue by his side represented the will of a Saint Realm expert.</p><p>The elders and disciples were awestruck by Qin Sang’s achievements, and the various clans of the Mist Sea were hesitant to act.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed to those below, saying "Excuse me," then sat cross-legged, refining the platform.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, no one dared approach!</p><p>Everyone watched as the stone platform beneath Qin Sang transformed into a jade platform, making his victory the easiest and his position the highest since the competition began.</p><p>This outcome was a direct result of his choices, Qin Sang knew. If he'd chosen the Ziyun Sky Lotus Pill, the other cultivators wouldn't have let him off so easily.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out to grasp the falling star, his hand passing cleanly through the flames to seize the Linghuan Key.</p><p>"He got it! He grabbed it!"</p><p>"What? An outsider can obtain it, but not us?"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang obtaining the Linghuan Key sparked another round of discussion, with the elders and disciples filled with resentment.</p><p>But it was done, and there was nothing they could do.</p><p>Achieving his goal without relying on the illusionary realm was unexpected, a fortunate turn of events allowing him to focus on helping Liuli overcome her tribulation.</p><p>He secretly sent a voice transmission to Yu Zhen, expressing his gratitude, then used his Dharma body to collect the Linghuan Key before flying away from the sacred mountain.</p><p>Everyone's gaze followed his Dharma body, but the competition continued, preventing them from focusing solely on Qin Sang.  Seeing him disappear, they could only quell their thoughts.</p>
