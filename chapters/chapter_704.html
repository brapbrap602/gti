<h1>Chapter 696: The Transaction</h1><p>“What price are you asking, sir?” Qin Sang played with the bone flute for a while, showing great interest, before looking up to ask the stall owner.</p><p>While Qin Sang examined the bone flute, the stall owner silently observed him.  Upon hearing the question, he didn't answer directly.  After a moment of silence, seemingly lost in thought, he finally couldn't help but ask, “Sir, have you recognized the origin of this bone?”</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared an excuse. Shaking his head, he said, “No, but I sense something from this bone, something that seems to resonate with my cultivation technique.”</p><p>He had the *Dunling Jue* to mask his aura; the stall owner was of comparable cultivation, so he wasn't afraid of being exposed.</p><p>The stall owner's eyes flashed.  “Forgive my impertinence, but may I ask what cultivation technique you practice?”</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted. “That’s quite impertinent of you! However, you can probably guess, and it doesn't hurt to tell you. My technique is unique, requiring the power of the stars for cultivation. That's why I'm interested in this bone. As you should know, whether in the Inner Sea or the Outer Sea, treasures like this bone, imbued with the power of the celestial stars, are rare.  Having stumbled upon one, regardless of its usefulness, I don't want to miss it.”</p><p>The stall owner let out a strange, raspy laugh.  “To my knowledge, among both humans and witches, cultivation techniques that harness the power of the stars are rarer than the treasures themselves.  It seems this item is indeed fated for you.”</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed impatience. “Have you decided, are you selling or not?”</p><p>“Selling!”</p><p>The stall owner gritted his teeth and decisively agreed, but when discussing the price, hesitation reappeared on his face. He said, “Just one magic artifact, and you can take this.”</p><p>Qin Sang's face suddenly darkened. He angrily said, “Are you making fun of me, or are you trying to take advantage now that someone is finally interested in this?  Not only do I not have any spare magic artifacts, even if I did, I wouldn't trade it for something of uncertain use.  It seems you have no sincerity.”</p><p>Embarrassment flashed across the stall owner's face, and he quickly stopped Qin Sang.  Their argument had attracted the attention of some nearby people. The stall owner waved his hand, creating a soundproof barrier, and whispered, “Friend, please don't be angry. Take a good look at this. It appears to be bone, but it's actually a strange material that’s neither bone nor not-bone.  This material is unique in the world of cultivation, something even we Foundation Establishment cultivators can't fully understand.  The material alone is worth no less than a magic artifact, let alone the secrets it might hold.”</p><p>Then, the stall owner dropped his guard, and began to plead his case.</p><p>“Before you, friend, I won't hide anything.  My current condition is all thanks to those wicked Witch Clan members. I self-destructed my innate magic artifact to barely escape with my life, and all my savings went to healing pills. I can't afford more magic artifacts. Without them, even if my injuries heal, what strength will I have left? This delay will only make my immortal path even more hopeless. This bone is a relic left by my master, of great significance to me. If I weren't forced into this desperate situation, I would never dare to consider this.”</p><p>Qin Sang's earlier feeling was right—this man was indeed severely injured.</p><p>His injuries must have been serious.  Even after taking so many pills, his complexion hadn’t improved.</p><p>Hearing the stall owner's seemingly heartfelt words, Qin Sang's expression softened slightly, but he still wouldn't concede.  “I don’t care how you got it. You've had it for years, so you must know it better than I do.  In my opinion, the likelihood of it containing secrets is low. It's probably a fragment of some treasure. If all the fragments could be collected, it would be a different story, but with only this small piece, its value is greatly reduced. The Demon Sea is vast; there's no chance of collecting them all. I'm just taking a gamble, and I'll only offer a talisman treasure.”</p><p>Qin Sang placed a talisman treasure on the counter in front of the stall owner.</p><p>Qin Sang had easily seen through the item, and the stall owner's face fell. He dejectedly said, “Friend, you truly are someone who cultivates the power of the stars, with insightful eyes... But this is no ordinary treasure.  No matter how weak I am, I wouldn’t sell it for a single talisman treasure.  If you’re unwilling to offer a higher price, I can only wait for the trade fair, or return to Huntian Island and see if the island master is interested.”</p><p>The stall owner's expression was resolute, making a deal impossible.</p><p>Though knowing he was bluffing, Qin Sang didn't dare gamble that there weren't other discerning people.  He thought for a moment and asked, “Do you know where your master obtained this bone?”</p><p>The stall owner shook his head. “When I met my master, he already had the bone. I later overheard him mention that he seemed to have bought it at a trade fair in the Inner Sea, but I don't know the exact location. If we knew its origin, my master and I would have searched for it long ago, and wouldn't be in this situation now.”</p><p>So it was from the Inner Sea, or possibly something that had drifted over from the Demon Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang hoped to find clues through this person, perhaps even other bone flute fragments, following this lead.  He knew it was a long shot.</p><p>However, having one fragment already, this one was not to be missed.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang's face fell.  He glanced around cautiously and used a secret voice transmission: "With all due respect, you haven't been able to make a deal with anyone else you've approached, have you?  I'll offer more.  I'll trade a magical artifact – a lifebound treasure – but we must agree beforehand: after leaving here, I will deny ever owning this artifact."</p><p>"A lifebound treasure?"</p><p>The vendor was startled, looking at Qin Sang with suspicion. "Someone else's lifebound treasure?"</p><p>"Whose else would it be?"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered. "Don't look at me like that. This artifact is war spoils taken from a Wu tribe bandit. I'm telling you this upfront to avoid trouble."</p><p>The vendor's expression cleared. "In the current situation, this isn't uncommon. I've never heard of anyone returning such a thing. Don't worry. It's just... a lifebound treasure is intrinsically linked to its owner's life force.  Used by another, its power will inevitably be greatly reduced…"</p><p>"With diligent cultivation, its power will gradually increase. It won't be significantly weaker."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted. "A fragment of unknown origin in exchange for a powerful artifact. If you're still greedy, I'll be leaving."</p><p>"Fine! Take it!"</p><p>The vendor reluctantly handed the bone flute to Qin Sang.  Qin Sang smirked, producing another person's lifebound treasure and giving it to the vendor.</p><p>Seeing it was a spiritual sword famed for its lethality, the vendor's eyes lit up with delight.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't linger, turning and leaving immediately.</p><p>A few steps away, he deliberately put the flute into his spatial pouch.  The flute immediately popped back out.</p><p>Qin Sang made a surprised sound and abruptly quickened his pace.</p><p>Only then did the vendor, who had been secretly watching Qin Sang's back, look away, lovingly examining the sword in his hand.</p>
