<h1>Chapter 1155: The Tribulation-Free Path</h1><p>Could these visions be the manifestations of inner demons?</p><p>Qin Sang was on high alert.</p><p>Achieving immortality had been his lifelong pursuit, his greatest obsession.</p><p>The Inner Demon Tribulation wasn't solely about dredging up one's deepest fears or most haunting memories. It was equally plausible for it to exploit one's obsessions.</p><p>Once he let his guard down, it would deliver a fatal blow—joy turning to sorrow.</p><p>The Inner Demon Tribulation followed the Thunder Tribulation, a testament to its peril. Once ensnared, escape would be nearly impossible.</p><p>"Uncle-Master!"</p><p>"Master Qin!"</p><p>...</p><p>The group flew to the island and saw Qin Sang sitting cross-legged. Though his body was charred and his appearance somewhat comical, he was alive and well.</p><p>However, as soon as they landed beside him, Qin Sang suddenly retreated several feet, his expression wary, as if facing a formidable enemy. Sword light flickered in his palm.</p><p>"Master, don't you recognize me? I'm your Little Fat Chicken!"</p><p>Having successfully broken through, Fat Chicken's attitude had changed dramatically. He fawned over Qin Sang, eager to curry favor, but Bai grabbed him before he could approach.</p><p>"Brother Qin, do you think you're still in the Inner Demon Tribulation and haven't emerged yet?"</p><p>Bai guessed the reason.</p><p>While only a moment had passed in the real world, for someone undergoing the Inner Demon Tribulation, it might feel like countless years had gone by in the illusion. Awakening suddenly, it was hard to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p>Bai signaled the others to step back, giving Qin Sang enough time to adjust.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the group, then looked down at his disheveled state. His gaze flickered uncertainly before he finally confirmed that he wasn't in the Inner Demon Tribulation—this was real.</p><p>He had successfully overcome the tribulation!</p><p>There truly was no Inner Demon Tribulation!</p><p>There was only one explanation for this—the Jade Buddha!</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned by the Jade Buddha's immense power. He had anticipated that under its protection, the Inner Demon's influence might weaken, making the tribulation easier.</p><p>But it was beyond belief that the Jade Buddha had completely erased the Inner Demon Tribulation, the most dreaded trial for cultivators!</p><p>"What level of treasure is the Jade Buddha?"</p><p>Qin Sang was lost in thought.</p><p>If this were to spread, the entire cultivation world would go mad.</p><p>Even the most precious and rare treasures recorded in ancient texts could only stabilize one's mind, increasing the chances of successfully overcoming the tribulation. Never had there been a treasure capable of erasing the Inner Demon Tribulation.</p><p>He had already held the Jade Buddha in high regard, but now it seemed he had still underestimated it.</p><p>"Am I already a Nascent Soul cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, inspecting the nascent infant within his body. His eyes gradually cleared. Spiritual light flowed over him, healing his external injuries, and he donned a fresh Daoist robe.</p><p>"Congratulations, Brother Qin, on shattering the Golden Core and ascending to Nascent Soul, transcending mortality!"</p><p>Bai clasped his hands in congratulations.</p><p>"Congratulations, Uncle-Master!"</p><p>"Congratulations, Master Qin!"</p><p>"Congratulations, Master!"</p><p>...</p><p>Li Yufu and the three demons bowed in unison, their faces filled with joy and envy.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded, surveying his surroundings. Everything felt new and vibrant.</p><p>The spiritual lake, the flying birds, the swimming fish—everything was within his control!</p><p>Qin Sang felt an overwhelming sense of exhilaration and let out a long, resonant roar that shook the heavens.</p><p>...</p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>The group sped across the Yun Cang Great Marsh, returning to their cave abode. Qin Sang, having just entered the Nascent Soul stage, needed to seclude himself to stabilize his cultivation.</p><p>"Uncle-Master, should we hold a Nascent Soul celebration and establish a sect?"</p><p>Li Yufu asked proactively.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, speaking calmly, "I still have unfinished business! If we hold a Nascent Soul ceremony now, how can I give that person the greatest surprise? Additionally, the identity of the Moonlight Demon King must continue to be concealed. As for establishing a sect..."</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang said, "The Sin Abyss remains unsettled, and the cultivation world is in turmoil. Now is not the best time. When you travel, if you encounter promising talents, you may take them in and guide their cultivation, but do not openly accept disciples for now. In the future, the sect will be called the Green Goat Temple."</p><p>Qin Sang had no particular obsession with establishing a sect. His original intention was to take in a few disciples to handle trivial matters, sparing him the need to attend to everything personally.</p><p>Since Wandering Cloud had the dying wish to reestablish the Green Goat Temple, and Qin Sang had received many favors from its three generations of disciples, he decided to continue using that name for the sect.</p><p>"This disciple thanks Uncle-Master on behalf of our ancestor!"</p><p>Li Yufu's eyes welled with tears. He had carried the burden of his ancestor's wish, but with only Golden Core cultivation, the responsibility had weighed heavily on him.</p><p>Qin Sang's decision effectively lifted that burden from his shoulders.</p><p>"No need for formalities."</p><p>Qin Sang helped Li Yufu up and encouraged him, "You are the true successor of our predecessors. I sense that you are on the verge of breaking through to the mid-Golden Core stage. With your talent, reaching Nascent Soul is highly possible. From now on, do not let external matters distract you. Focus on your cultivation, strive to form your Nascent Soul as soon as possible, so I can entrust the Green Goat Temple to you and travel freely."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang turned to the three demons and said to Little White, "You don't need to return with me. Go back to the Thousand Bamboo Sea now and share the good news with Fellow Daoist Liu. I will remain in the Yuan Shen Sect for quiet cultivation. If anything major happens, send me a message."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>The three demons reluctantly bid farewell to Qin Sang and returned to the Thousand Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang and the others arrived near the Yuan Shen Sect. Li Yufu parted ways with them and returned to his cave abode alone.</p><p>That cave was suitable for Golden Core cultivators, but for a Nascent Soul Ancestor, it was somewhat shabby. Fortunately, Qin Sang held the Yuan Shen Sect's elder token, allowing him free access to the sect, so there was no rush to find a new abode.</p><p>It would be even better if he could see Senior Sister Qing Jun.</p><p>Li Yufu returned to share the good news with Tan Yi'en and the others, and their excitement was palpable.</p><p>Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his cultivation, disguising himself as a Golden Core cultivator. As he approached the sect's gate, he noticed that the guards were much stricter than usual.</p><p>"Who goes there!"</p><p>A group of disciples flew out from the gate, stopping Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations of his cultivation, the disciples stiffened. Upon seeing the token in Qin Sang's hand, they panicked and hurriedly opened the sect's formation, bowing in respect. "Greetings, Elder Qin! We were blind and failed to recognize you. Please punish us!"</p><p>"You were guarding the sect. There is no fault in that. Rise."</p><p>Qin Sang was in excellent spirits and had no intention of punishing the disciples.</p><p>As he entered the Yuan Shen Sect, Qin Sang paused and asked, "Is the Ancestor within the sect?"</p><p>"Reporting to Elder Qin, as far as we know, the Ancestor and the other elders went to the front lines and have not returned."</p><p>The leading disciple replied.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and swiftly flew toward the Yuan Shen Sect's restricted area.</p><p>As Qin Sang's figure disappeared into the restricted area, the other disciples gathered around.</p><p>"Is that the legendary, most mysterious Elder Qin?"</p><p>"So young! And so approachable!"</p><p>"That's what you call a commanding presence!"</p><p>"I heard Elder Qin appeared out of nowhere, already a late-Golden Core powerhouse, and gained the Ancestor's trust, allowing him to cultivate in the restricted area. Do you think he's being groomed as the next sect leader?"</p><p>"Could be! In this war, so many elders went to the front lines, but Elder Qin, with such high cultivation, was left behind. It must be to protect him!"</p><p>...</p>
