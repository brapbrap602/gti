<h1>Chapter 1291:  Qin the Fiend</h1><p>Secret Glowstones are precious materials for refining magic artifacts.  They are extremely difficult to mine; any misstep causes the stone's power to dissipate, rendering it worthless. Only Golden Core cultivators, or at least Foundation Establishment cultivators, can carefully extract them using specialized techniques.</p><p>Deep within the vein, in a secluded chamber:</p><p>A person is meditating. This individual has a small goatee and is shorter than average, yet wears an oversized black robe.</p><p>Their aura is extremely faint, almost nonexistent.</p><p>This person is Hu Mazi, the Yuan Ying cultivator guarding the mine.</p><p>His appearance is hideous, his face scarred and pitted, like a pockmarked face. His fellow cultivators jokingly call him "Hu Mazi" (literally, "Pockmarked Hu").</p><p>Once handsome and dashing, Hu Mazi suffered an accident while exploring a hidden realm in the Abyssal Ruins.  He contracted a strange poison, barely surviving, but the lingering poison invaded his bones, leaving him with his grotesque appearance.</p><p>After several attempts at using secret techniques to restore his looks failed, Hu Mazi accepted his fate.</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing shriek echoes outside the chamber, jolting Hu Mazi awake.  Panic-stricken shouts follow from above:  “We’re under attack! Everyone, be careful!”</p><p>Hu Mazi's expression darkens. After a moment's thought, he darts out of the chamber.</p><p>He's well aware of the current situation; he anticipated an attack from the Two Realms Alliance to seize the mines, but not this soon.</p><p>Years of mining have left a large, man-made chasm above the Secret Glowstone vein.</p><p>The chasm's defensive barrier is activated.</p><p>Hu Mazi flashes across the chasm, looking up at the barrier.  It's shaking violently; the enemy's attack is already overwhelming the defenses.</p><p>“Four Yuan Ying cultivators!”</p><p>Seeing four figures, Hu Mazi is startled.  One of them stands out immediately.</p><p>This person is shrouded in a blur, surrounded by raging demonic flames, their power terrifying. The defensive barrier is no match.</p><p>Hu Mazi suddenly remembers someone, focusing his spiritual sight to see the person’s face. His expression changes drastically, and he cries out, “Qin the Fiend!”</p><p>Immediately, Hu Mazi takes flight, escaping deep into the mine without a word. The surrounding cultivators, waiting for his orders, are dumbfounded.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face darkens upon hearing Hu Mazi's exclamation.</p><p>After the Battle of Twin Mirror Mountain, the moniker "Qin the Fiend" spread rapidly, initially among the lower-level cultivators of the Abyssal Ruins, and now it's common knowledge.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Jingyu jointly break through the defensive barrier. Ignoring the fleeing lower-level cultivators, they activate their lightning escape technique, transforming into two streaks of lightning to pursue Hu Mazi.</p><p>Sensing the rapidly approaching presence behind him, Hu Mazi is terrified. Knowing escape is impossible, he stops, turning to face his pursuers.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jingyu’s speed doesn’t falter; they move with perfect coordination, flanking Hu Mazi.</p><p>Hu Mazi, only at the early stage of Yuan Ying, is no match for Qin Sang, let alone both of them.</p><p>To avoid complications, Qin Sang unleashes eighteen demonic banners; Jingyu uses a recently acquired treasure, a thunder fork, perfectly suited to her abilities.</p><p>*WHOOSH!*</p><p>*CRACK!*</p><p>Demons flames roar, wild thunder strikes.</p><p>Hu Mazi gasps, summoning a black ancient cauldron to hover above his head.  The next moment, he’s engulfed by demonic flames and thunder, quickly disappearing.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Qin Sang senses something is wrong. Hu Mazi died too easily.</p><p>When he retracts the demonic flames, the space is empty. Hu Mazi seems to have been reduced to ashes, leaving only the ancient cauldron floating there.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jingyu exchange glances, about to examine the cauldron when it suddenly explodes!</p><p>Meanwhile:</p><p>Hundreds of miles from the mine, deep underground in a narrow, dark chamber containing only a strange altar, a figure materializes from the ethereal to the solid.  It's Hu Mazi.</p><p>Hu Mazi appears, stumbles, then steadies himself, his face pale.</p><p>“Fortunately, I made preparations.  I never expected Qin the Fiend to come personally. Those demonic flames are terrifying; the rumors don't exaggerate.  A moment's delay, and I would have been injured. I planned to use the Dou Xuan煞珠 (Dou Xuan killing bead) in the cauldron as a last resort, even if I couldn't win.  It probably wouldn't harm Qin the Fiend, so I’d better leave.  The others are on their own!”</p><p>Hu Mazi, still shaken, glances around and leaves the chamber.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang and Jing Yu followed the trail to a hidden chamber, but Hu Ma Zi was nowhere to be found.</p><p>"These old devils are all so slippery," Qin Sang sighed helplessly.</p><p>Jing Yu chuckled, "Those not cunning enough are already dead.  Only the most shrewd survive. Dongyang Bo is especially cautious, never traveling alone, always surrounded by other Yuan Ying cultivators.  It's impossible to find any flaw in his actions. What are your plans, friend? My cultivation is almost complete. I will return to my cave soon to cultivate and refine the Corpse Flower Amber."</p><p>"If you sense an opportunity for a breakthrough, friend, return to the mountain for seclusion.  The tribulation is paramount," Qin Sang said, waving his hand dismissively. "Dongyang Bo is no longer an immediate threat. Unless there's a huge advantage, cultivators from the Two Realms Alliance would be unlikely to be swayed by him. I only need to guard against Dongyang Bo colluding with outside enemies, using them as pawns. If he truly seeks his own destruction, I, Qin, wouldn't mind lending a hand."</p><p>Jing Yu nodded, "It's good you are prepared."</p><p>The four then split up, seizing all the spirit mines in the area.  Zuyuan had no time to sabotage them. The process went smoothly; Zuyuan seemed to have no resources to spare for these places.</p><p>Elder Ji stayed behind to guard.</p><p>Other cultivators assigned to take over the mines were on their way.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two returned.  Naturally, they didn't make the trip for nothing; the previous yield, which Zuyuan hadn't managed to transport away, was tacitly divided among the four.</p><p>Having successfully completed their task, the three encountered a small-scale battle on their way back: a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators, led by two Golden Core cultivators, engaged in a fierce fight.</p><p>Zang Qing raised a hand, shooting a thumb-sized black spike from his sleeve. It instantly appeared before a Zuyuan Golden Core cultivator's face.</p><p>The cultivator, only then noticing the three figures in the air, was horrified.  He attempted to flee, but it was too late. The spike pierced his forehead, killing him instantly.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance cultivators cheered, quickly eliminating the rest and rushing to pay their respects.</p><p>Upon inquiry, they learned that the two armies had met in a head-on clash, triggering a major battle. Zuyuan was well-prepared, while the Two Realms Alliance was caught off guard and now facing a tough fight.</p><p>The three immediately set off to reinforce them.</p><p>Ahead, the battle raged, with continuous shouts and killing cries.</p><p>After flying a short distance, Qin Sang scanned the battlefield, observing the situation.  Casually, he spotted a familiar figure, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p>
