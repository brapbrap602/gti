<h1>Chapter 1750: Demotion</h1><p>Finally, a Nascent Soul cultivator has made their move!</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted as he focused his gaze intently.</p><p>Earlier, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had already detected this person. Uncertain whether the cultivators of this realm were xenophobic, Qin Sang had refrained from using even a trace of his divine sense, relying solely on his spiritual perception. As expected, the other party remained completely unaware of him.</p><p>This caution was also due to Qin Sang's lack of understanding of the methods employed by the Divine Path.</p><p>From his understanding, the White Dragon Lord received offerings from the common people along both banks of this river, making this area akin to its fiefdom. It likely had means to control its territory and sense any abnormal fluctuations. However, Qin Sang was still unaware of the specific methods it might possess.</p><p>From the shouts of the wolf demon and the female Daoist, it was clear that the Nine Dragons Kingdom was merely a mortal nation under her rule, perhaps comparable to the former Great Sui Dynasty.</p><p>In a mortal kingdom, even a single city had city gods and water deities guarding it, their strength comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators. Further away, several other fluctuations could be sensed.</p><p>The first battle he witnessed in this realm actually involved a Nascent Soul-level cultivator. Seeing a part of the whole, it was evident that the overall strength of the cultivators in this realm was not to be underestimated.</p><p>Qin Sang was not particularly surprised by this. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth in this realm was far denser than in the Storm Realm. As long as the issue of chaotic spiritual energy was resolved, cultivation here would be easier than in the Storm Realm.</p><p>Four pillars rose to form a prison.</p><p>Water and fire intertwined.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations emanating from the Water-Fire Heavenly Prison, a trace of gravity appeared on Qin Sang's expression.</p><p>This Heavenly Prison had the ability to seal all directions and suppress its targets, faintly resembling the power of a Deity Transformation cultivator invoking the might of heaven and earth. Once trapped within, the opponent would endure endless torment from water and fire.</p><p>If he were to rely solely on his physical body to resist, breaking free would be no easy task.</p><p>Of course, this was assuming the other party could actually trap him within.</p><p>He recalled the dark light that had appeared before the Heavenly Prison was established. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had seen through its essence—it was a black spiritual talisman.</p><p>This talisman was not made of the usual talisman paper but was instead condensed from spiritual power, yet it differed from the talisman cultivators he had encountered before.</p><p>"Is this realm one where the Divine Path and Talisman Path coexist?" Qin Sang pondered silently, his gaze sweeping over the four heavenly pillars. He had a feeling that the full power of this Heavenly Prison had yet to be unleashed.</p><p>It was unclear whether the cultivator believed these wolf soldiers were not worth the effort or if they simply lacked the strength to do so.</p><p>As expected, the moment the wolf soldiers fell into the Water-Fire Heavenly Prison, their momentum was immediately dampened. The Heavenly Wolf, which had previously possessed the power to sever rivers and shatter mountains, was now surrounded by heavenly flames and icy cold, trapped precisely at the intersection of water and fire, enduring a dual assault.</p><p>"Clang! Clang! Clang!"</p><p>The sound of chains echoed continuously—it was not an illusion after all.</p><p>From the eastern heavenly flames, streaks of crimson light shot forth, while from the western icy cold, white ribbons of frost condensed, all converging toward the Heavenly Wolf.</p><p>The Heavenly Wolf swung its head frantically, spewing forth streams of black light that shattered the chains, but to no avail.</p><p>There were simply too many chains, an endless barrage.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A fiery chain shot forth, easily piercing the wolf's abdomen and immediately connecting with an icy chain. Other chains quickly joined in, swiftly forming a thick, two-colored divine chain that appeared exceptionally sturdy.</p><p>The Heavenly Wolf was a manifestation of divine power. Under normal circumstances, it should not be injured, nor should it be bound by chains.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as the Heavenly Wolf leaped with all four limbs, it found itself unable to break free from this chain. The sound of clinking chains filled the air as it was firmly restrained in place.</p><p>The giant wolf, sensing danger, no longer cared about the female Daoist and hastily ordered its demon soldiers to change formation.</p><p>The lesser demons were also filled with fear, especially the miscellaneous soldiers, who were trembling so badly that they would have scattered if not for the wolf generals keeping them in line.</p><p>However, the wolf soldiers were the giant wolf's personal guards, and their eyes instead gleamed with ferocity. The military formation suddenly shifted, splitting into three groups. The central group formed a circle, while the two wings alternately separated and merged, their movements extremely intricate.</p><p>Each wolf soldier seemed to transform into a talisman character, and the entire formation resembled a talisman diagram or battle array.</p><p>The female Daoist, who had been in a precarious situation, suddenly felt the pressure lessen. She quickly looked up and saw a vast expanse of dark blue water waves in the sky, as if the river had descended from the heavens.</p><p>Amidst the misty waves, rows upon rows of water snake soldiers marched on the water's surface, their forms robust and imposing. At the center of the formation, atop an altar, stood a middle-aged Daoist priest in ceremonial robes, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>Beside the middle-aged Daoist stood two water snake demons, one male and one female, both with human heads and serpent bodies—they were two Demon Kings in their transformed states!</p><p>The water snake Demon Kings' eyes glowed with divine light, their auras filled with killing intent. Their cultivation and demeanor far surpassed those of the water snake demon generals under the female Daoist's command.</p><p>"Master?"</p><p>The female Daoist was overjoyed. She quickly turned the altar, and her troops, following her orders, charged out of the Heavenly Prison together.</p><p>The Water-Fire Heavenly Prison did not bind her, allowing her to leave effortlessly. The female Daoist left the altar alone and flew to the middle-aged Daoist's side, her face filled with shame. "Disciple acted recklessly, disappointing Master."</p><p>The fact that her master had arrived so quickly to rescue her meant he must have been secretly watching over her all along, witnessing her earlier actions.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist stroked his beard and said, "Wait until I subdue this demon, then we'll discuss it."</p><p>The female Daoist hurriedly bowed her head and stood to the side, her heart filled with anxiety.</p><p>At that moment, another change occurred within the prison. The wolf soldiers, using some unknown grand formation, caused the Heavenly Wolf's body to rapidly shrink until it was the size of a human head. Its light shifted, suddenly transforming into a white glow, like a white treasure flame, which shot into the eastern heavenly flames.</p><p>The treasure flame, upon touching the heavenly flames, began to absorb strands of the fire.</p><p>Immediately, the balance of water and fire within the Heavenly Prison began to falter. The four heavenly pillars trembled slightly, causing the mountains and rivers to shake—clearly, the foundation was unstable.</p><p>The female Daoist was shocked. Her master, who presided over a regional altar, possessed unfathomable cultivation. How could a mere group of rogue soldiers break the prison he had established?</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist, however, remained calm. After a moment of contemplation, he said to the water snake Demon Kings beside him, "With our cultivation, establishing the Water-Fire Heavenly Prison is somewhat beyond our capabilities."</p><p>The Demon Kings replied in unison, "The Water-Fire Heavenly Prison is a divine ability studied by those at the Profound Mysteries level. For you, Master, to have established it is already a rare feat in the world."</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist chuckled. "Have you two forgotten your own contributions? Very well, let's re-establish the Water Prison."</p><p>The two demons nodded. Their gazes swept over the formation, and though the water snake soldiers made no visible movements, a light, ethereal aura rose from each of them, floating toward the altar. The spiritual energy coalesced into a brush, writing a shimmering water talisman in mid-air.</p><p>A chant accompanied it:</p><p>"Within the vast sea of darkness lies a stone city.</p><p>Evil spirits guard the gates, venomous dragons devour essence.</p><p>By the decree of the Water Official, banish the ghosts and gods.</p><p>Those who dare defy the heavenly laws shall be cast adrift and destroyed.</p><p>Swiftly!"</p><p>The talisman floated down, like a beam of water light, and entered the Heavenly Prison. Within the prison, the ice melted and the flames extinguished, replaced by a deep, unfathomable lake that reflected the sky.</p><p>With the flames gone, the treasure flame lost its target, floating aimlessly in the water, seemingly at a loss.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist sneered. "The Danxiao Treasure Flame? Merely a superficial imitation of the Danxiao Mansion's techniques, yet you dare perform such tricks before me!"</p><p>Before his words faded, a massive wave rose within the Water Prison, crashing down upon the Danxiao Treasure Flame.</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>The wave carried the force to shatter mountains. The Danxiao Treasure Flame flared brilliantly, a pillar of fire shooting skyward as if to break open the Heavenly Prison.</p><p>Alas, the Danxiao Treasure Flame was no match. The pillar of fire was struck by the wave and instantly shattered, scattering countless embers that were swept away by the residual force, soon vanishing without a trace.</p><p>As the flame dimmed, like a candle in the wind, another wave rose within the Water Prison, obliterating it completely.</p><p>With the flames extinguished, the wolf soldiers beneath were exposed.</p><p>The giant wolf's breath was heavy, its eyes filled with ferocity as it glared at the middle-aged Daoist.</p><p>It did not beg for mercy. If it had merely been hunting demons and ghosts in the wild, it could have used its untamed nature as an excuse. But having seized the Daoist's altar and plotted to kill a high-ranking official of the Celestial Pivot Court, the Daoist sect would never tolerate it. It activated its formation once more, summoning another wolf shadow.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist, however, was not about to give it another chance. Within the Water Prison, streams of white mist spontaneously formed, writhing and coiling like white snakes. At first, there were only a dozen or so, but in an instant, they multiplied into countless strands, weaving together into a massive net that descended abruptly.</p><p>The demonic formation the giant wolf was attempting to complete was still unfinished. The illusory wolf shadow in the air touched the net and, as if crushed by a mountain, instantly shattered.</p><p>The wolf soldiers' formation faltered. The demons felt as if struck by a heavy hammer, immediately thrown into disarray, some even vomiting blood.</p><p>With the formation in chaos, the giant wolf had no time to reorganize its troops. The white snakes took advantage of the confusion, easily binding the lesser demons one by one and dragging them away, vanishing in an instant.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, only three wolf generals and a few lesser demons remained.</p><p>The giant wolf, knowing its fate was sealed, let out a furious howl and charged toward the sky. Even with the force of a thunderbolt, it was no match for the middle-aged Daoist. It failed to break through the white net, which wrapped around it layer by layer. At first, it struggled, but soon it fell still.</p><p>As for its demon soldiers, all were subdued, not a single one escaping.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist acted as if he had merely performed a trivial task. He casually glanced at the Heavenly Prison but did nothing further. Instead, he turned his gaze downstream toward the city god's troops. With a flick of his finger, a golden ring shot forth, landing directly in the formation's chariot and capturing someone, who was then brought back.</p><p>The city god's troops stirred but dared not make a sound, continuing to advance with trepidation.</p><p>The one captured by the golden ring was none other than the city god.</p><p>Earlier, seeing the situation turn dire, the city god had attempted to flee in secret. Little did he expect that the female Daoist had a master behind her, and not just any master, but the lord of a regional altar. He hurriedly returned to the formation.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the middle-aged Daoist's keen eyes had already spotted him.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist looked at his disciple and said, "Do you know where you went wrong today?"</p><p>The female Daoist lowered her head. "I failed to investigate the enemy's situation and acted overconfidently."</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist shook his head slightly. "The troops I assigned to you were trained soldiers, and I placed you directly in charge of a regional altar. That was perhaps too hasty. Compared to your peers, you lack experience."</p><p>The female Daoist's face flushed with shame. "Disciple..."</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist interrupted her gently. "This demon is cunning and dared to plot against a Daoist cultivator of our Celestial Pivot Court. Even others might have fallen for its schemes, so I do not blame you. Your mistake lies in the fact that as a regional altar master, under the governance of our Daoist court, you should have made good use of the divine spirits. Before moving your forces, you should have issued talismans first!"</p><p>He paused, then continued with his hands clasped behind his back. "As the saying goes, 'Nurture the spirits for a thousand days, use them in a single moment!' The gods of mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas all serve at your command. Who could harm you?"</p><p>As he spoke, an air of authority emanated from the middle-aged Daoist.</p><p>The city god, kneeling on the altar, trembled in fear.</p><p>The female Daoist suddenly understood and bowed respectfully. "Disciple has learned her lesson!"</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist nodded slightly, then turned his cold gaze toward the city god. "For disobeying summons and fleeing in the face of battle, the penalty is death! Guards, strip him of his divine position and take him to the Yuehu Temple to await judgment!"</p><p>The city god's face turned ashen, and he collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Two water snake demon soldiers immediately stepped forward, bowed to the middle-aged Daoist, and seized the city god. They removed his official hat and divine robes, then restrained him and flew off into the distance on a beam of light.</p><p>By then, the city god's troops had arrived. Some were humanoid, but most were demons. They knelt on the riverbank, all filled with terror.</p><p>They had not been negligent, so the middle-aged Daoist did not reprimand them. He turned to the female Daoist and said, "The day of the sacrificial ceremony is approaching, and it is crucial for purging the ancient six heavens' miasma from the people's bodies. We cannot allow the people here to have no city god to worship. As the regional altar master, it falls upon you to appoint a new city god."</p><p>The female Daoist bowed in acknowledgment, her expression easing. She asked, "Master, how did you know there were rogue soldiers causing trouble here?"</p><p>She had received reports of demons being slaughtered in this area and, believing she could handle it, had sent a message to the regional altar before hastily setting out.</p><p>The regional altar had various departments handling such matters, and such a minor issue would not have reached her master's desk.</p><p>"Not long ago, while paying respects to the Censor at the Jinglu, I happened to meet a fellow Daoist from the Danxiao Mansion. They mentioned that a Daoist from their mansion had suddenly gone missing, suspected to be due to a rebellion among their troops. Hearing this, I found it somewhat coincidental and came to investigate," the middle-aged Daoist explained.</p><p>The female Daoist's face showed a trace of fear.</p><p>As he spoke, the middle-aged Daoist waved his hand slightly. The giant wolf's altar exploded with a loud bang, and the Danxiao Banner within transformed into a stream of light that flew into his palm.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist examined it for a moment before handing it to the female Daoist. "The Daoist from the Danxiao Mansion should still be at the Jinglu. Assist me in delivering this banner and take it to them on my behalf."</p><p>The female Daoist accepted it with both hands, her face filled with gratitude.</p><p>Her master's words had affirmed her contribution, and this mission would allow her to establish a good relationship with that Daoist. Although the Danxiao Mansion was not as formidable as the Celestial Pivot Court or the North Pole Demon-Subduing Court, it was still a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>As she held the Danxiao Banner, she thought of the demon soldiers imprisoned in the Water Prison and glanced at it. "Master, why not eliminate the evil demons? What use is there in keeping them?"</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist extended his right hand, palm facing downward, and clenched his fist. The four pillars of the Heavenly Prison trembled slightly before transforming into streams of light that flew into the sky.</p><p>"Troops rebelling and altars exploding are common occurrences. However, the death of a Daoist and the rogue soldiers daring to plot against our Celestial Pivot Court members require further investigation."</p><p>Before his words faded, four dragon pillars appeared on the altar, extending chains that firmly bound the giant wolf and its demon soldiers beneath them.</p><p>The giant wolf looked listless, weakly glancing at the Daoist.</p><p>The Water Prison was not merely a place of confinement—it had already subjected the wolf to immense suffering.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist casually glanced at the wolf demon, about to interrogate it, when his expression suddenly shifted. He stared at the wolf demon and let out a soft exclamation.</p><p>"Master, what is it?" the female Daoist asked hurriedly.</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist suddenly looked into the distance and shook his head. "I didn't expect it to be a pair of wolf and hyena demons. The hyena demon is the mastermind behind this. I was careless and let it escape."</p><p>The female Daoist was shocked. "What should we do?"</p><p>"No matter," the middle-aged Daoist said calmly. "The wolf and hyena are one entity, capable of transferring cultivation between them. I sense that the true great demon is the hyena, which has already transferred its cultivation into this wolf. The hyena must have suffered significant damage and lost its altar. It is no longer a concern."</p><p>Soon, the group departed.</p><p>Before leaving, the middle-aged Daoist glanced at White Dragon Crossing, a hint of doubt in his expression.</p><p>...</p><p>Upstream along the great river, in a mountainous area.</p><p>A hyena demon, its form resembling a fox, was stealthily hiding when it suddenly heard a voice behind it. "Fellow Daoist, please stay."</p><p></p>
