<h1>Chapter 1978: One Against Two</h1><p>A streak of light shot out of the Soulfall Abyss, abnormally swift, piercing through the wasteland, entering the Twilight Mountains, and heading directly east.</p><p>The streak of light was like a gray wave of smoke splitting the sky, rolling and surging, vast and mighty.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The sound of breaking the air was like heavenly thunder descending upon the world, shaking the heavens and earth, bringing an unprecedented shock to the wasteland and the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>Countless cultivators were startled awake from their meditative trances, their faces filled with terror.</p><p>Even before hearing the thunderous sound, they could feel a terrifying pressure, pervading heaven and earth.</p><p>It was as if the sky was about to collapse!</p><p>A primal fear made countless people tremble, cowering and shivering in their caves.</p><p>Doomsday was approaching, the world was splitting apart, and there was nowhere to escape.</p><p>The thought of resistance simply couldn't arise in their minds, as if that pressure represented the will of heaven and earth.</p><p>Born between heaven and earth, how could one dare to defy the will of heaven and earth?</p><p>…</p><p>Within a valley, green shade was like a sea, and ancient trees towered into the sky.</p><p>‘Chirp… chirp… chirp…’</p><p>Joyful calls came from the forest.</p><p>Through the gaps in the leaves, one could see a group of white-furred, long-armed Spirit Apes chasing and playing.</p><p>These Spirit Apes jumped from branch to branch as if walking on flat ground, incredibly agile.</p><p>Their movements had a strange rhythm, like a unique movement technique, completely natural.</p><p>The Spirit Apes were completely unaware.</p><p>On a nearby tree, a faint human figure stood, observing the group of Spirit Apes with interest, fingers gently moving, seemingly imitating their movements.</p><p>Suddenly, this person's expression changed drastically.  Their figure flickered, pressing close against the tree trunk, their body seeping into the bark like water, merging with the ancient tree.</p><p>The ancient tree's bark twisted, revealing a terrified human face.</p><p>The Spirit Apes also sensed the anomaly, letting out sharp shrieks and scattering in all directions.</p><p>Hidden within the tree, this person still felt uneasy, and遁ed from the trunk into the ground, using a secret technique to hide within the tree roots.</p><p>The next moment, the streak of light flew overhead.</p><p>Underground, a human figure the size of a cicada huddled in the tree roots, their whole body trembling uncontrollably, not daring to return to the surface for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>A certain wondrous peak in the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>The scenery was beautiful, and spiritual energy was abundant.</p><p>There was a sect here, named the Eight Tripods Sect, both righteous and unorthodox, quite renowned throughout the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>The founding ancestor of the Eight Tripods Sect was a Nascent Soul cultivator. Subsequent sect leaders were unable to surpass the ancestor.  When the current sect leader discovered flaws in the cultivation method, he eliminated the drawbacks and broke through to the Deity Transformation stage in one fell swoop, a true genius.</p><p>Because of the current sect leader's feat, the Eight Tripods Sect's fame spread throughout the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>However, this sect leader was very clear-headed, not eager to expand the Eight Tripods Sect, steadily consolidating its foundation, and restraining his disciples from becoming arrogant.</p><p>On this day, the tranquility of the mountain gate was shattered by the urgent ringing of a bell.</p><p>The Profound Bell ringing meant that the Eight Tripods Sect was facing a life-or-death crisis.</p><p>Accompanying the bell was the sect leader's roar, "Quickly activate the Mountain Protection Grand Formation!"</p><p>The disciples of the Eight Tripods Sect were greatly alarmed; they had never seen their sect leader so urgent and panicked.</p><p>The moment the grand formation was activated, a terrifying pressure swept across.</p><p>Even the Mountain Protection Grand Formation couldn't block that pressure.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The disciples of the Eight Tripods Sect trembled, involuntarily kneeling on the ground.</p><p>In front of the main hall, the sect leader of the Eight Tripods Sect stared fixedly at the streak of light in the sky, using immense willpower to stabilize his mind.</p><p>His eyes were filled with awe, terror, and a deep anticipation!</p><p>…</p><p>The river flowed endlessly.</p><p>The river flowed between two mountains, the terrain treacherous, the current swift.</p><p>White waves splashed continuously on the river's surface.</p><p>From time to time, river fish leaped out of the water, and as they fell back, a slender black shadow would rise beneath the surface, revealing a sharp-mouthed snout full of fangs, swallowing the fish in one gulp.</p><p>When the pressure arrived.</p><p>In an instant, the wind howled and the waves surged, as if the water at the bottom of the river had been churned up.</p><p>The streak of light flew past, disappearing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The river gradually calmed down, and a monster, neither snake nor fish, floated to the surface, belly up, lifeless.</p><p>It was the fish-swallowing beast.</p><p>Its spirit had been broken by terror, scared to death on the spot!</p><p>…</p><p>The higher one's cultivation, the more one could sense the power of the master of this escaping light.</p><p>They finally witnessed the legendary Void Refinement cultivator capable of controlling heaven and earth, but not everyone could withstand that kind of impact.</p><p>Patriarch Minghu seemed extremely urgent, breaking through the air, making no attempt to conceal his movements.</p><p>He couldn't afford to be late; the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar was unearthed by the Nine Immortals of Cloud Metropolis, and only two people were present at the Soulfall Abyss, completely unable to stop the Nine Immortals of Cloud Metropolis.</p><p>A single step slower, and Cloud Metropolis might seize the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar first.</p><p>Concealing his aura was also meaningless.  In the surrounding area, the only one qualified to compete with him for the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar was Solitary Cloud Elder.</p><p>With the emergence of the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar, Solitary Cloud Elder couldn't remain idle either, and would definitely descend the mountain.</p><p>The value of a single Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar outweighed all other legacies combined, and the gentlemen's agreement between the two sects certainly didn't include the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar!</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder, with his Dharma Body traveling, though not as imposing as Patriarch Minghu, also caused quite a stir in the Cloud Metropolis Mountain, and his speed was not the slightest bit slower.</p><p>…</p><p>Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang had left his seclusion at some unknown point, departing the underground chamber and ascending into the sky, gazing towards the north.</p><p>“They're already coming out of seclusion?”</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators moving shook the world.</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, feeling quite surprised.</p><p>He had made his move in the Fire Domain, interfering in the mortal world, all his arrangements were to lure the two Void Refinement cultivators out of seclusion.</p><p>Today, his wish was fulfilled, but it was somewhat unexpected.</p><p>Too fast, too easy.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't clear about the true value of the Crimsonfire Copper Pillar.</p><p>Relying on this item alone to alarm two Void Refinement cultivators might have a sliver of possibility, but Qin Sang hadn't held much hope.</p><p>As long as he could incite conflict between the two sects and deepen their contradictions, it would be considered making the most of it.</p><p>Qin Sang had made two preparations, making his move while also interfering in the mortal world, stirring up chaos, and gradually dragging the two sects into the quagmire.</p><p>He hadn't expected it to be so easy to succeed, rendering all his subsequent plans unnecessary.</p><p>This showed that the value of the Crimsonfire Copper Pillar far exceeded his estimations.</p><p>Missing out on the treasure, Qin Sang didn't feel the slightest bit regretful, because it wasn't important.</p><p>Instead, he felt a faint excitement, eager to try.</p><p>Just in time!</p><p>Some ideas could finally be verified!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed as he looked down at the Azure Goat Temple below.</p><p>Smoke curled up from the kitchens at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Yu Lang had achieved fame and success, the academy had become a sacred place in the hearts of the Yan Kingdom's people, and scholars coming to pay homage were endless.</p><p>Seven Rows Village benefited from this, expanding again and again, becoming increasingly prosperous, like a small town.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his palm downwards.</p><p>An invisible barrier enveloped the land, blocking the sight of mortals and concealing all fluctuations.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The mountain peak where the Azure Goat Temple stood suddenly cracked.</p><p>The fissure ran through the mountain, passing right through the Azure Goat Temple, splitting the main hall of the temple in two.</p><p>The mountain slowly tilted to both sides, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The interior of the mountain was exposed, lightning flashed, and the Main Altar appeared!</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation high in the sky, directly above the Main Altar, closing his eyes and forming hand seals.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>A muffled thunderous sound, as if coming from deep within the earth, echoed in this space.</p><p>The mortals down below couldn't hear the thunder at all, still living their normal lives.</p><p>Even the cultivators near Jinyi County were completely unaware.</p><p>All unusual phenomena were deliberately suppressed by Qin Sang, but his movements didn't stop, his hand seals changing continuously, faster and faster.</p><p>With each hand seal formed, a thunder rune left his hand, merging into the Main Altar.</p><p>Then the Main Altar would generate lightning, shooting towards the sky, divine thunder filling the heavens.</p><p>In a short while, a vast thunder lake formed between heaven and earth.</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in the sea of thunder, and these thunderbolts formed a gigantic thunder altar right beneath him.</p><p>This altar connected with heaven and earth, brewing divine power, hidden but ready to be unleashed!</p><p>The next moment, the Main Altar below showed another unusual sign, emitting a dazzling silver light, even surpassing the thunder lake in the sky.</p><p>A silver ‘paper’ appeared within the Main Altar, emanating an exceptionally mystical aura.</p><p>The surface of the silver paper was covered in writing.</p><p>The writing was constantly changing.</p><p>These characters were profoundly mystical, resonating with the ultimate truths of heaven and earth, each character seemingly containing infinite knowledge.</p><p>A single glance from a mortal could cause their mind to collapse, their head exploding!</p><p>The silver paper undulated, as if it could detach from the altar and shoot towards the sky at any moment, but it was also suppressed by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions were precisely activating the altar, not launching it, but gathering power, ready to strike.</p><p>With the Main Altar appearing, the entire altar formation was activated along with it.</p><p>In the four directions, east, south, west, and north, Taiyi, Luohou, Lingshi, and Guihou, the four Deity Transformation cultivators, all sat in meditation on the branch altars, their faces solemn.</p><p>They presided over the four branch altars, which could be seen as the four pillars of the altar formation, stabilizing the four cardinal directions and guarding the Main Altar!</p><p>Qin Sang's will, through the Main Altar, was transmitted through the altar formation, and the branch altars beneath the four Deity Transformation cultivators all flashed with thunder light.</p><p>Besides the four branch altars, other branch altars also had altar masters presiding over them.</p><p>These altar masters were fire spirits, demons, almost no humans, and all had revealed their true forms.</p><p>Over the years, they had been assigned to the four Deity Transformation cultivators, cultivating thunder techniques, and had all achieved a certain level of mastery.</p><p>At this moment, these demon creatures sat in imitation of human posture, following the commands from an unknown source, casting spells, and blazing thunderfire ignited beneath them.</p><p>It was as if the altars were burning.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't require them to have high comprehension; as long as they could use thunder techniques and preside over the branch altars, stabilizing the altar formation, that was enough.</p><p>The four Deity Transformation cultivators received Qin Sang's guidance, and these branch altar masters obeyed the four Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>The branch altars, the Main Altar, all the altar masters were connected as one, forming a vast altar formation covering the mortal world!</p><p>Qin Sang was the master of the Main Altar, the controller of the altar formation.</p><p>He activated the altar for the first time, sensing the entire altar formation, a strange expression appearing on his face.</p><p>At this moment, what he thought of were scenes from the Talisman World.</p><p>The remnants of the Dao Court, relying on the altar, gathering the power of the Dao, and Celestial Master Zhang using the altar to invite deities and break through, slaying a Grand Ascension cultivator in one fell swoop.</p><p>The astonishing divine might was breathtaking.</p><p>Qin Sang finally experienced the power of the altar firsthand, and it truly lived up to its reputation!</p><p>And the altar beneath him definitely wouldn't rank high within the entire Dao Court.</p><p>The immortal path was long, and he still had a long way to go.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, slowly opening his eyes and standing up on the thunder altar.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang took a step to the left, and an identical version of himself was left in his original spot.</p><p>Two Qin Sangs stood side-by-side, one the original body, the other the Dharma Body.</p><p>This was a true Dharma Body, not the incarnations that had descended to the mortal world in previous lives.</p><p>The Dharma Body slightly raised both hands, palms facing downwards, sword light flashed, a sword shadow appeared, the sword inverted, slowly rotating.</p><p>This sword was the Gray Oriole Sword.</p><p>Moreover, it was the Gray Oriole Sword that had transformed into a spiritual treasure, giving birth to a sword spirit!</p><p>‘Hum! Hum!’</p><p>The Gray Oriole Sword seemed to sense its master's thoughts, letting out a sharp sword cry, full of spirituality.</p><p>The spiritual sword emanated killing intent, its blade ready to move according to its master's will, severing all enemies!</p><p>“Caw! Caw!”</p><p>Along with the sword cry came a strange bird call.</p><p>A ring of fire danced around the Gray Oriole Sword; it was the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird seemed to have been suppressed for too long, with no semblance of a holy beast, its cries filled with excitement, urging Qin Sang: "Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! This Vermilion Bird can't wait any longer!  The first victory belongs to this Vermilion Bird!"</p><p>This silly bird was truly audacious, wishing for chaos in the world.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird knew what they were going to do next, but it didn't show the slightest fear or worry.</p><p>The Dharma Body flicked its sleeve, storing the Gray Oriole Sword and the Vermilion Bird within.</p><p>At the same time, azure light appeared behind Qin Sang's original body, pure azure light, accompanied by a phoenix cry, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Image was summoned!</p><p>The Azure Phoenix spread its wings, its wings covering the sky.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix Dharma Image stretched its body to its fullest, flew high into the sky, and then dove down, transforming into a streak of azure light that poured into Qin Sang through the top of his head.</p><p>The Dharma Image merged with his physical body, and Qin Sang's aura instantly changed.</p><p>At the same time, five-colored light flashed, and Xiao Wu appeared.</p><p>Returning to the mountain, Xiao Wu seemed to have forgotten the mortal world, cleansed of worldly distractions.</p><p>She still kept her eyes closed, standing beside Qin Sang, her face serene, innocent and carefree.</p><p>The original body took Xiao Wu's small hand, nodded to the Dharma Body, and headed northeast.</p><p>…</p><p>Cloud Metropolis Mountain.</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder left the mountain gate, traveling west alone.</p><p>His escaping technique was rather peculiar. He pointed the purple bamboo staff in his hand forward, the tip of the staff touching the void, and purple light erupted.</p><p>The purple light was like lightning, instantly crossing mountain ranges.  When the purple light faded, Solitary Cloud Elder would appear within it.</p><p>The purple lightning continuously leaped, gradually reaching the edge of Cloud Metropolis Mountain.</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder held the staff in one hand and used the other to make calculations, his expression not relaxed.</p><p>“That Corpse Devil, I don't know if its divine abilities are fully developed. If so, it won't be easy to deal with…”</p><p>While he was pondering, Solitary Cloud Elder suddenly sensed something, his expression changing abruptly, and he heavily tapped the void with his purple bamboo staff, stopping the purple lightning.</p><p>On a mountaintop directly ahead, a strange Daoist priest stood, his hands behind his back, gazing towards him.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, from where do you come, and why are you blocking this old man's path!”</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder shouted sternly, but didn't act rashly.</p><p>He sensed the aura of a Dharma Image from Qin Sang.</p><p>Although some exceptionally talented demon cultivators could comprehend a Dharma Image in the Deity Transformation stage, it was absolutely impossible for them to possess such powerful and dense Dharma Image power!</p><p>Something unusual must be happening.</p><p>This Daoist priest was a complete stranger to him, yet he blocked his path at this time.  Could he be a helper called by the Corpse Devil?</p><p>“This humble Daoist is Qing Feng. I have long admired Fellow Daoist Solitary Cloud Elder's great name, and have come specifically to pay my respects.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed from afar, stepping aside to reveal what was behind him: a chessboard carved from a stone table, two stone stools, and black and white chess pieces.</p><p>The chessboard and pieces were carved from ordinary stone, taken from the surroundings.</p><p>“I've heard that Fellow Daoist is skilled in the Dao of Chess. This humble Daoist would like to invite Fellow Daoist to a game.  I wonder if you are willing?” Qin Sang gestured in invitation.</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder narrowed his eyes, scrutinized Qin Sang for a moment, then looked at the chessboard, as if pondering something.</p><p>After a short while, he actually flew forward, landing on one side of the chessboard, and gently tapped the ground with his purple bamboo staff.</p><p>Qin Sang smoothed his Daoist robe, sat down, and instructed: "Xiao Wu, serve tea!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Xiao Wu walked forward carrying a tea tray.</p><p>Like an obedient little Daoist child, she knelt properly by the side, arranged the teapot and teacups, and began to meticulously brew the tea.</p>
