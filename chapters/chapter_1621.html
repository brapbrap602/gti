<h1>Chapter 1612: The Pawn</h1><p>Chapter 1612: The Pawn</p><p>As they spoke,</p><p>the Curtain of Heaven array enveloped Tenglong Cliff, its black canopy expanding outward.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others felt it instinctively, falling silent and looking up to observe the array's changes.</p><p>With their keen eyes, they could see that the Curtain of Heaven array wasn't simply sealing Taiyue Sect; it was actively disrupting Taiyue Sect's protective mountain array.</p><p>From the outside, the Curtain of Heaven array seemed all-pervasive, embedding itself within Taiyue Sect's protective array.</p><p>The two spiritual arrays almost overlapped, the dark canopy clearly spreading within the protective array.</p><p>These two distinctly different arrays, normally incompatible, now merged perfectly, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>Key nodes of Taiyue Sect's protective array were either invaded, obscured, or destroyed by the Curtain of Heaven array, significantly weakening its power.</p><p>This demonstrated the extraordinary sophistication of the Curtain of Heaven array.</p><p>Su Zinan, a successor of a Nascent Divinity cultivator, possessed unparalleled knowledge.  Because of this, he understood the immense difficulty of such a feat.</p><p>His eyes flashed, and he secretly used his divine abilities to mentally simulate the array's next moves.  Even with the previous clues, he found it incredibly challenging.</p><p>He looked at the white-haired elder with surprise, his assessment of the man rising significantly.</p><p>The white-haired elder had been plotting against Taiyue Sect for an unknown period, possessing intimate knowledge of its protective array. Even for a master array master, achieving this would require immense effort; it was practically impossible.</p><p>Furthermore, sealing Taiyue Sect was merely the initial preparation, not even the first step. They hadn't even seen a sign of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect yet.</p><p>No single person, nor any large faction, could accomplish this!</p><p>It required plotting from long ago, cultivated over generations, with the plan gradually implemented.</p><p>This was the hallmark of a Wuxiang Immortal Sect successor.</p><p>"By my foster father's standards, your mastery of arrays is truly exceptional. I am in awe!"</p><p>Su Zinan was always refined and courteous in public; he wouldn't bully others with his status as a Nascent Divinity successor.  He admitted his mistakes and readily praised those more skilled than him.</p><p>Nobody could see his brutal nature.</p><p>"Unbelievable that besides Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan, Tianhao Pavilion hides such a master. The Quyang Mountain lineage of Tianhao Pavilion is not well-known. You hiding within this lineage is a tremendous waste of your talent. In my opinion, your abilities are sufficient to replace either of them. If I hadn't accompanied my foster father and interacted with Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan, I would have thought one of them was disguising themselves to make fun of me."</p><p>The white-haired elder's subordinates all wore long robes to conceal their identities, but their true nature was revealed as soon as they clashed with Taiyue Sect. Su Zinan and the others were exceptionally perceptive, finally seeing through his disguise.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man clearly already knew the white-haired elder's identity, while others were astonished. They didn't expect him to have such a prestigious background, hailing from the number one sect of the demonic path.</p><p>The white-haired elder manipulated the Curtain of Heaven array with ease, still able to respond. "Su Daoist, you flatter me. Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan possess profound demonic arts and are on the verge of Nascent Divinity. I, on the other hand, can only meticulously seek out the old site of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and look for opportunities. The difference is obvious."</p><p>His words subtly indicated that he wasn't aligned with Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan.</p><p>Everyone understood.</p><p>Tianhao Pavilion wasn't a unified entity. The hearts of demonic cultivators were fickle, and internal conflicts were more severe than other sects.</p><p>If this person colluded with Yu and Fan, adding him to their ranks, Tianhao Pavilion could easily open the Wuxiang Immortal Sect with a few allies; they wouldn't need to go through so much trouble.</p><p>Those targeting the Wuxiang Immortal Sect weren't limited to the righteous and Buddhist sects. The demonic path also benefited greatly back then, and Tianhao Pavilion showed no mercy towards the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's remnants.</p><p>Preventing the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's resurgence seemed to be a consensus among the major sects of the Central Plains; otherwise, its traces wouldn't have been erased so thoroughly.</p><p>The remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect had infiltrated Tianhao Pavilion, forming their own lineage.  The most dangerous place was indeed the safest; the ancients were right.</p><p>While others were discussing, the sword-carrying man remained silent.</p><p>After a light cough, the sword-carrying man said solemnly, "To my knowledge, the Quyang Mountain lineage's leader is only at the mid-Yuan Ying stage. Observing your abilities, you clearly didn't reach this level recently.  Have you been hiding in the shadows all along?"</p><p>"I am indeed the Quyang Mountain leader, Zhu Wu Dao," the white-haired elder nodded.</p><p>The sword-carrying man was surprised. "You've been hiding this for so long from Yu and Fan?"</p><p>"My master passed down some minor techniques, nothing noteworthy," Zhu Wu Dao said indifferently, offering no further explanation.</p><p>After a while, Zhu Wu Dao withdrew his control, allowing the array to evolve on its own. He sensed the outside, letting out a long sigh. "With Mo Daoist and the others personally handling things, there should be no problems! The situation is settled; it's time for us to begin."</p><p>Pausing, Zhu Wu Dao recalled something and looked at the grotesque-faced man. "Where is the Poison King now?"</p><p>The grotesque-faced man made a calculation. "The Cave Master and I set up a deceptive formation outside. Unless something unexpected occurs, he should have been lured to the heart of Manzhou."</p><p>"That's good. The Poison King alone can't cause much trouble!"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao nodded. "As long as we can draw the Poison King away for a while, even if the Wuxiang Immortal Sect appears and lures him over, by the time the news reaches Jinyu Prefecture, it will be too late. We have plenty of time."</p><p>...</p><p>As they spoke, the sounds of battle raged outside Tenglong Cliff.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>...</p><p>The sound of drums suddenly echoed from within Taiyue Gate.</p><p>Each drumbeat was faster than the last.  These weren't ordinary drums.  They sounded as if they originated from the earth itself, commanding the mountains to rise. The drumbeats were deep and resonant, not shrill, yet those who heard them felt an overwhelming sense of urgency; their hearts pounded, and they felt a suffocating pressure.</p><p>With each drumbeat, panic spread throughout Taiyue Gate.</p><p>This was the Taiyue Sacrificial Drum, built atop the main peak by the sect's founding ancestor. It wasn't a magical artifact, but it held immense significance for Taiyue Gate.</p><p>The drum was only struck in times of extreme crisis. Since Taiyue Gate rose to become the dominant force in the Southern Prefecture, the drum had been silent for countless years.</p><p>Taiyue Gate disciples were told of the Sacrificial Drum upon entering the sect, but none had ever heard it sound.</p><p>The moment the drum sounded, regardless of cultivation level or reason, every member of Taiyue Gate immediately converged on the main peak.</p><p>To make matters worse, night fell without warning.</p><p>From the darkness, it seemed as if a hundred ghosts were roaming, further terrifying the disciples.</p><p>They knew something was wrong, but they never imagined the trouble would originate from within.  Had their protective formations become useless?</p><p>For a time, Taiyue Gate was thrown into chaos.  Streams of light flashed from all directions, rushing towards the main peak.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, these fleeing disciples became easy targets.</p><p>Lower-level Taiyue Gate disciples were no match for the invaders.  Slaughter ensued; waves of light extinguished, punctuated by the occasional short, desperate scream.  Most, like the gate guards, died silently.</p><p>The invaders, unsatisfied with slaughtering the lower-level disciples, turned their attention to Taiyue Gate's main peak. Taiyue Gate's elite reacted quickly, most having already gathered at the main peak and activated their formations.</p><p>At that moment, the Sky-Obscuring Xuan Array covered the main peak, but the darkness couldn't completely engulf it; a Xuanhuang light flickered there.</p><p>The Sky-Obscuring Xuan Array could only break the protective formations around the mountain; the main peak had its own independent array.</p><p>However, the Sky-Obscuring Xuan Array's power was indiscriminate.</p><p>The main peak's array was also surrounded by darkness; the yellow light appeared thin and dim.  The strange occurrences here were invisible to the outside world, making communication impossible.</p><p>"Old Chi, where are you going!"</p><p>Suddenly, two streaks of light, one red and one white, appeared from the darkness.</p><p>The white light led, the red trailed behind.</p><p>The red light was the Qiling Cave Master.  His search had been fruitless until he unexpectedly discovered someone acting suspiciously.</p><p>Even better, this person had a score to settle with him!</p><p>The white light belonged to a burly man with a ruddy complexion. Upon seeing the Qiling Cave Master, his eyes widened in fury: "It's you!"</p><p>The Qiling Cave Master chuckled darkly: "Back then, you all clamored to raze my Qiling Cave, to drive me out of the Southern Prefecture. Did you ever imagine this day would come?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a red light shot from the Qiling Cave Master's palm.</p><p>The red light was incredibly vibrant—a red flower, resembling a trumpet flower, hanging upside down in the air, its opening aimed directly at Old Chi.</p><p>*Woo woo…*</p><p>A strange whistling sound emanated from the flower's center, the red light flickering.</p><p>There was no grand, overwhelming attack.</p><p>But the moment the whistling sound began, Old Chi reacted instantly, throwing himself to the ground. With a loud *boom*, he smashed into the hard mountainside, creating a large crater.</p><p>Then, a yellow light flashed from Old Chi's body, and he merged with the rock, disappearing underground.  Meanwhile, the crater bulged upwards, even higher than before, forming a distinct mound.</p><p>The mound's texture was clearly different from the surrounding mountain; it had regular patterns, resembling a stone shield.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>A series of explosions rocked the mound; a dozen knife-like cuts appeared on its surface, accompanied by fleeting, illusory knife shadows.</p><p>The mound collapsed.</p><p>A muffled groan came from within.</p><p>Seeing that he hadn't managed to force Old Chi out, the Qiling Cave Master changed his incantation. The red flower suddenly swelled to the size of a small mountain, like a giant bell, and crashed down toward the direction Old Chi had fled.</p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p>just as the red flower was about to land, the ground cracked open, and a black light shot into the sky—a stone stele flew out from the earth.</p><p>The square stele bore no inscriptions or runes, only the two characters 'Dingfeng'.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>A deafening roar.  Hong Hua and the Dingfeng Stele, one falling, one rising, collided violently.  A blinding red light erupted, staining half the sky crimson.</p><p>The Dingfeng Stele's impact was less noticeable in the darkness.</p><p>But Hong Hua faltered, its descent arrested.</p><p>The Qiling Cave Master, surprised by this unexpected interference, his face changed slightly.  Any attempt at redress was too late.</p><p>*WHOOSH!*</p><p>The stele shot into the air, towards the main peak.</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, the Qiling Cave Master abandoned the pursuit, his gaze turning coldly towards the Taiyue Sect's main peak.  Faint figures flickered within the protective yellow glow of the formation.</p><p>They were rescuing people.</p><p>At that moment, a figure materialized from the fluctuating void beside the Qiling Cave Master.</p><p>"Mo Daoyou, you were too slow," the Qiling Cave Master said, his tone displeased.</p><p>This was Mo Xingdao.  Had he acted decisively, he could have stopped Old Chi.</p><p>Indecisiveness—how could he be the North Waste's top independent cultivator?</p><p>"The Poison King set a trap," Mo Xingdao responded, deflecting the criticism.</p><p>The Qiling Cave Master, surprised by Mo Xingdao's perceptiveness, reluctantly nodded.  "The Poison King set a trap."</p><p>"The Poison King?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao was taken aback.  Seeing the Qiling Cave Master's reluctance to elaborate, he didn't press further, instead following his gaze towards the main peak.  "I need to prevent others from breaking through."</p><p>This served as an explanation for his previous actions.  Their goal wasn't to hunt down Taiyue Sect's experts, but to ensure the news didn't leak and keep the Taiyue Sect confined to the main peak.</p><p>The Qiling Cave Master grudgingly accepted this explanation.</p><p>On the main peak, the Taiyue Sect disciples were in disarray.  Those who had managed to escape to the main peak wore no smiles.  Many had witnessed their kin slaughtered, others fallen into the hands of demons, doomed forever.</p><p>The Yuan Ying stage cultivators guarding the mountain gathered, desperately maintaining the protective formation – their last defense.</p><p>They were centered around an elderly man whose face was etched with wrinkles.</p><p>Anger was momentarily forgotten; they had to find a way to break through the siege.</p><p>Then, a figure arrived, panicked: "Grand Elder, the communication formation is down!  Someone tampered with it inside the mountain gate!"</p><p>The elder was the current Grand Elder of the Taiyue Sect, a cultivator at the peak of the mid-Yuan Ying stage.  Though further advancement was unlikely, his spiritual sense had reached the point of taking a physical form, making him a renowned figure in the cultivation world.</p><p>This dire news caused an uproar.</p><p>Grand Elder's expression remained calm.  His voice, though quiet, reached every ear.  "Everyone, calm yourselves.  In this chaos, I have already alerted the Sect Master.  We need only hold the main peak; reinforcements will arrive. We will retaliate and avenge our kin!"</p><p>These words steadied their hearts.  Panic subsided among the Taiyue Sect disciples.</p><p>The Grand Elder closed his eyes, appearing to be half-asleep, no different from any ordinary old man.</p><p>Unseen, his gaze pierced through the protective formation, towards the hellish scene beyond the main peak.  Those Taiyue Sect disciples had been vibrant lives just moments ago.</p><p>His eyes weren't entirely devoid of emotion.  Although he had already sent his most promising disciples away under various pretexts, the sight of these innocent victims still brought him sorrow.</p><p>These disciples never suspected they had been abandoned by their respected Grand Elder and Sect Master—sacrificial pawns!</p><p>This plan had begun the moment the target—the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect—was identified.</p><p>While the mastermind behind the plan was Zi Lei Zhenren, the master of the Eight Scenic Views, both he and Yue Litian had no reason to refuse, offering their assent without hesitation.</p><p>Because afterward, the Taiyue Sect would be eligible to enter the South Sea Immortal Palace!</p><p>The longevity of the Eight Scenic Views and the Ganlu Zen Temple stemmed from a secret realm within the South Sea Immortal Palace.</p><p>Both sects had Nascent Divinity stage masters, jointly controlling the South Sea Immortal Palace, preventing outsiders from interfering.  Each generation of great cultivators could enter the Palace to increase their chances of breakthrough.</p><p>Entry to the South Sea Immortal Palace was entirely at the discretion of these two sects.</p><p>Rumors proved true: the Taiyue Sect's dominance in the South State was due to the Eight Scenic Views' covert support.</p><p>Even so, the Eight Scenic Views weren't generous enough to offer them a place.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren promised that after the next opening of the South Sea Immortal Palace, the Eight Scenic Views would cede a spot to the Taiyue Sect!</p><p>Who could refuse such an offer?</p>
