<h1>Chapter 777: Blocked Entrance</h1><p>Racing along the way.</p><p>Along the journey, I not only encountered various ferocious beasts, but also secret locations resembling thatched huts. However, I never found another opportunity as opportune as when I encountered the red-tailed crane, and I had no chance to make a move.</p><p>Qin Sang avoided other cultivators as much as possible. After several twists and turns, she finally clearly saw the Sky Tower.</p><p>Surrounding the Sky Tower was a flat, open area, like a plaza.</p><p>There were no buildings in the open area; only this tower stood alone. However, Qin Sang quickly discovered many ruined walls on the surrounding mountains.</p><p>Due to the lack of protective restrictions, they were all destroyed.</p><p>However, from the remaining traces, it can be seen that these places must have housed large-scale ancient halls, and were once an important location of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>The scene before her eyes matched the image from the crystal she obtained from Du Han.</p><p>The difference was that no ancient corpses fell from the clouds this time.</p><p>After waiting fifty years, she finally returned here!</p><p>What exactly happened in the Sky Tower back then? Why did she fall from outside the tower and inexplicably appear in the Western Frontier?</p><p>With the two-headed…  (Note: The original text uses a character that is difficult to translate and likely refers to a magical item or creature;  I've omitted it for clarity)  returning to its slumber, Qin Sang stood on the mountaintop, seeing the scene at the base of the Sky Tower. The surprise in her eyes suddenly faded, replaced by a look of uncertainty.</p><p>On the open ground below the Sky Tower, dozens of cultivators were gathered, neither entering the tower nor leaving.</p><p>Some of these people stood together in groups of three or five, others sat alone in meditation.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned these people and did not find Xiang Yi and the others.</p><p>They occasionally looked up at the entrance of the Sky Tower, their expressions showing varying degrees of anxiety, yet none dared to barge in.</p><p>At the entrance of the Sky Tower stood an old man, like a door god.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to him. From his clothing, it was clear he was a Wu tribe cultivator.</p><p>His aura was subtle, not showing any strong pressure, as he stood motionless in front of the entrance.</p><p>From a distance, he looked like an ordinary old man without cultivation.</p><p>This made Qin Sang even more vigilant.</p><p>This person was very likely a Nascent Soul Grandmaster of the Wu tribe; otherwise, so many cultivators would not stand obediently outside, not daring to cross the line.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after going through so much hardship to reach the Sky Tower, this was the scene.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank, filled with suspicion and confusion. "The Wu tribe has entered the Seven Killing Hall; their target is also here? Could it be that the Wu tribe intends to occupy the Sky Tower indefinitely, preventing others from entering? This is too arrogant!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the people outside the tower and found that among them were Wu tribe cultivators.</p><p>These people could not enter the Sky Tower and were reluctant to leave, suggesting the situation might be more complicated than it appeared.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang swiftly moved down the mountain, quickly reaching the edge of the open area. Some people in the plaza noticed Qin Sang, then turned away without interest.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed her surroundings and walked towards a kind-faced old woman, bowing and saying, "Excuse me, senior… My surname is Qin. I wish to enter the Sky Tower. I wonder why so many fellow Daoists are waiting here?"</p><p>"Daoist Qin, there's no need for such formality. My surname is Su; just call me Daoist Su."</p><p>The old woman smiled kindly and subtly pointed to the man at the entrance. "We, like Daoist Qin, arrived late and can only wait. It is said that at the beginning, the Great Shaman and the Demon Lord entered the Sky Tower one after another, and did not prohibit other cultivators from entering. Later, other senior members of the Wu tribe arrived, but for some unknown reason, they blocked the entrance, not allowing anyone to pass, and left this senior to guard it, saying they would let people through after a while. Those who disobeyed received a lesson and suffered quite a bit…"</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang learn what had happened.</p><p>At the very beginning, the Demon Lord and the Wu tribe were in a standoff.</p><p>The Great Shaman dispersed the other Nascent Soul experts and entered the Sky Tower alone, followed by the Demon Lord.</p><p>But the other Nascent Soul experts also faced challenges; it is said they encountered a counter-attack from human Nascent Soul experts.</p><p>The human Nascent Soul experts were likely under the Demon Lord's command, tasked with monitoring the Wu tribe's Nascent Soul experts. Several locations witnessed fierce battles.</p><p>As for whether there were casualties, no one knows.</p><p>Later, for some unknown reason, those Wu tribe Nascent Soul experts returned and entered the Sky Tower one after another, along with some human Nascent Soul experts.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the Great Shaman, who were the first to enter the Sky Tower, have not reappeared since.</p><p>No one knows what happened inside the Sky Tower. After seeing so many Nascent Souls enter, those who saw the entrance blocked actually found it preferable.</p><p>The conflict between the two races' Nascent Souls—even a small ripple could take their lives. Waiting for the situation to stabilize before entering might not be a bad thing.</p><p>After thanking the old woman, Qin Sang walked to the edge of the plaza and frowned.</p><p>Unlike the others, the Sky Tower involved the secret of the ancient teleportation array; regardless of how dangerous it was inside, she could not back down.</p><p>But now, a Nascent Soul expert was guarding the entrance, and even though she was anxious, she could only be patient.</p><p>There was still some time before the Seven Killing Hall closed, but she did not know when they would be allowed to pass.</p><p>Unexpectedly, despite hurrying, I was stuck at the entrance.  If only I'd lingered on the road and searched more thoroughly, perhaps I could have found the spirit fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Returning now was unrealistic; he could only wait.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he recalled his recent busy schedule. The newly acquired Golden Yao Lock hadn't been refined yet.  He decided to use this opportunity to complete its refinement, giving him an extra defensive measure once inside the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang darted into the woods. After losing sight of the other cultivators, he left a corpse puppet to observe the situation, found a secluded spot, and set up a barrier array.</p><p>He first took out the Golden Light Armor.</p><p>The Golden Light Armor was covered in dents.  Given his skill in crafting, repairing it wouldn't be difficult; he had the necessary materials in his Qianjun Ring, but it would take time—time he didn't have.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, withdrew his mind, and examined the Golden Yao Lock.</p><p>In his dantian, the Golden Yao Lock was enveloped in his dantian fire.  Under the continuous refinement of the fire, the previous owner's mark had been completely erased, transforming it into an ownerless treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly familiarized himself with the artifact's properties, then used his spiritual sense and true energy to refine it.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, put away the Golden Yao Lock, and stood up.</p><p>At that moment, at the edge of the woods, the corpse puppet was facing off against two people.</p><p>One was the old woman Qin Sang had spoken to earlier, and the other was a middle-aged man.</p><p>The corpse puppet was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, a casually created item by Qin Sang. These two could easily kill it, yet they hadn't, patiently waiting outside, seemingly without malice.</p><p>Sensing this, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, put away his array disc, and slowly walked out.</p><p>"Daoist Qin."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge, the old woman's face lit up.</p><p>"Daoist Su."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, then looked at the other person. "And this is...?"</p><p>He was surprised to find that the middle-aged man was a Wu tribe cultivator.</p><p>The middle-aged man stepped forward and said proactively, "Daoist Qin, my surname is Di.  We apologize for the intrusion.  Daoist Su and I have come to invite you to join us in entering the Heavenly Tower."</p>
