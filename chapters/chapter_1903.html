Chapter 1894: Refining the Void


The demon core entered his stomach.
Qin Sang did not rush to refine it.
Ever since Lei Zu's descent, Qin Sang felt himself undergoing an earth-shattering transformation.
Too many changes had occurred previously, leaving him no time for contemplation.
The closer the crisis, the more composed he must remain!
Qin Sang purged all distracting thoughts, his mind entering a state of profound stillness as he recalled the events following Lei Zu's arrival.
Every detail, every subtle sensation, had to be examined.
Most of his memories were blurred, his perceptions chaotic.
At that time, he had pointed towards the heavens, condensing the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, instantly mobilizing this world's spiritual energy, transforming it into thunder…
Far too many details were missing.
Qin Sang consolidated all his memories as best he could, seeking the insights and tremors originating from the deepest recesses of his instincts.
Suddenly, he raised both hands, palms facing the sky.
The spiritual energy around his hands immediately began to vibrate.
'Whoosh…'
The stirring of spiritual energy generated a faint breeze flowing between Qin Sang's fingers, the sound intensifying.
Gradually, visible ripples appeared in the void, like gusts of ethereal azure wind coiling around his hands, escalating into a raging gale.
This was a sign of the mobilization of spiritual energy, a manifestation of a cultivator's initial harmony with the heavens.
After reaching Nascent Soul, once their cultivation stabilized, cultivators could easily manipulate spiritual energy, reaping numerous benefits such as a significant increase in the power of their Daoist arts and divine abilities.
As their cultivation progressed, their ability to manipulate spiritual energy would strengthen, gradually pursuing the unity of heaven and man, until they attained the Void Refinement realm, mastering the heavens!
Qin Sang's current manipulation of spiritual energy appeared impressive, but there was a vast difference between manipulation and mastery.
Unsurprisingly, this was Qin Sang's limit.
However, a shocking scene unfolded.
Qin Sang's fingers trembled slightly, drawing together as he grasped two streams of spiritual energy in his palms.
The streams first solidified, then a small vortex appeared at their center.
The two streams vibrated intensely, rotating with the vortex, ultimately being assimilated!
'Swish!'
His fingers opened completely.
The vortex continuously devoured the surrounding spiritual energy, as if Qin Sang held two tornadoes in his hands.
This sight was practically indistinguishable from complete mastery of spiritual energy.
Qin Sang's eyes remained closed, his mind replaying the moment the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal was formed, the eight thunder dragons converging from all directions.
Lei Zu descended, the seal activated, and the spiritual energy transformed into thunder dragons, obeying his command!
Naturally, Qin Sang couldn't fully replicate this. He had been struggling against Lei Zu's power, only able to grasp a fraction, but that was enough!
"Master the heavens! Master the heavens! All things within my grasp, the heavens at my command… Is this the unity of heaven and man? Is this the divine power of a Void Refinement expert?"
A tempest surged within Qin Sang's heart. His premonition was correct, perhaps even underestimating the benefits of Lei Zu's descent.
Guided by Zuo Zhenren, Qin Sang had understood the path to Void Refinement and tentatively determined that the most suitable approach for him was to gradually balance the five elements, seeking mutual generation, thereby achieving harmony between himself and the heavens.
Which Nascent Soul cultivator hadn't, after reaching the peak of Nascent Soul, spent years of painstaking cultivation, gradually gaining enlightenment?
Qin Sang had essentially ascended to the heavens in a single step!
Even during the golden age of Daoism, such a scenario was exceedingly rare.
A Daoist master summoning a talisman deity one realm above their own was already the limit.
What had descended into Qin Sang was the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunderclap Universal Transforming Heavenly Venerable, far exceeding his realm.
Had it been a talisman deity comparable to Void Refinement, Qin Sang could have borrowed its power for insight, aiding his breakthrough, but it would hardly have been this instantaneous.
Ancient Daoist masters could, like the Kun Dao, personally protect and summon high-rank talisman deities for their disciples and descendants, assisting their breakthroughs, but they wouldn't resort to this unless absolutely necessary.
Firstly, this was extremely dangerous, potentially damaging the disciple's foundation, resulting in more harm than good.
Secondly, summoning required the master's full protection. The higher the talisman deity's rank, the greater the pressure on the ritual conductor, even more so than summoning for themselves. Any mishap could implicate them, at best severely depleting their vital energy.
Thirdly, if the disciple lacked sufficient mental fortitude, even a high-rank talisman deity could only barely maintain a sliver of clarity, leaving them muddle-headed, unable to glean any insights.
Most importantly, forcibly elevating one's realm without personal comprehension was akin to揠苗助長 (spoiling things by excessive enthusiasm), artificially creating obstacles for future cultivation, fraught with hidden dangers.
Unless it was an exceptionally talented disciple with impeccable character, ensuring minimal risk, or during a life-or-death crisis for the sect, they would not rashly perform this ritual.
Protected by the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang's 'character' was impeccable, among the best of the best!
It was equivalent to a Body Integration Grandmaster summoning a Great Ascension talisman deity, personally bestowing enlightenment upon a mere Nascent Soul Qin Sang, granting him a firsthand experience of the unity of heaven and man, aiding his breakthrough.
Such an honor, from ancient times to the present, perhaps only Qin Sang had enjoyed.
It was unlikely to happen again.
The eighth level of Thunder City.
The lightning vanished.
Previously, the Lei Zu Grand Hall was enveloped in thunder and lightning; now, it had fallen utterly silent.
The hall was deathly still.
Tiny lightning bolts flickered on the Lei Zu statue, which upon closer inspection were intricate, crisscrossing cracks.
The cracks covered the statue, a shocking sight.
One worried it might shatter into pieces at the slightest touch.
…
"Was the Daoist Sect's use of Lei Zu's power through me intentional or unintentional?"
Qin Sang realized the truth might not be as he had thought; the Daoist Sect and Tian Yue Shangren might not have abandoned him.
Perhaps they were battling a stronger enemy, unable to extricate themselves, and thus couldn't attend to him, but they had left him a glimmer of hope.
It depended on whether he could seize this lifeline!
After all, he had caused all of this; he couldn't fault anyone.
It could be said that Qin Sang's current understanding far surpassed his cultivation, lacking only the accumulation of true essence.
As for his comprehension of the Killing Dao and his cultivation techniques, they posed no problem.
Before this, Qin Sang had joined forces with Zuo Zhenren to slay Ling You Wang, who had self-severed his cultivation.
Now, he had annihilated the two demon kings with thunder.
He had channeled demonic energy, nearly exterminating Ren Ying.
These enemies' cultivation far surpassed his, once forcing him into desperate straits, narrowly escaping death.
Although it wasn't his own power, he had undeniably been the participant, playing an indispensable role.
He cultivated the Killing Dao, not the Sword Dao. As long as he could slay his enemies and settle the karmic debt, why be fixated on the method?
He wondered if all of this was also within someone else's calculations?
'Rumble…'
The vortex of energy in Qin Sang's palms suddenly dissipated.
A flash of lightning revealed an altar.
"Hmm?"
Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he noticed that within the altar, the inner truth he had cultivated through contemplation had been replaced by a divine intent resonating with Lei Zu's aura.
"Lei Zu?"
He had seen the altars of many Daoist cultivators, their guardian deities' auras more solid than his own.
Qin Sang found the guardian deity's divine intent strangely dormant. His attempts to perceive it were like stones sinking into the sea.
Nevertheless, Lei Zu still possessed protective power.
To Qin Sang, the presence or absence of a guardian deity made little difference. He instantly dismissed it, his mind sinking into the Phoenix Wings.
'Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!'
Azure feathers danced.
Azure lightning flickered between the plumes.
Suddenly, a brilliant azure light erupted, releasing a ball of azure thunder towards the altar.
This was the Azure Phoenix True Thunder. Previously, when Qin Sang drew lightning to forge his altar, he could only cautiously attract a trace. Now, he could directly separate a thunderball.
He could not only control spiritual energy but also manipulate the Azure Phoenix True Thunder with greater ease.
Qin Sang realized he couldn't control all the Azure Phoenix True Thunder yet, but a portion was sufficient.
'Swoosh!'
The thunderball plunged into the altar, instantly dispersing.
Streaks of azure thunder diffused within the altar, emanating a violent aura, raising concerns of an explosion.
Unfazed, Qin Sang guided the azure thunder into the altar, becoming its framework, gradually perfecting it.
This was also thanks to Lei Zu's power, channeled through him to unleash the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal.
Qin Sang wouldn't claim complete mastery of this divine talisman, but his understanding was sufficient to construct an altar surpassing the requirements of the Nascent Soul realm!
Daoist talismans inherently aided cultivation.
Enhancing the altar and stabilizing his true essence would greatly benefit Qin Sang's upcoming breakthrough.
The Azure Phoenix True Thunder was exhausted, the altar instantly formed.
Without pausing to admire the sturdy altar, Qin Sang immediately recalled it into his body!
…
With immense composure, he meticulously completed each step.
Finally, Qin Sang spread his arms.
Accompanied by a phoenix cry, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol appeared, flapping its wings and circling above Qin Sang's head before merging into his body.
The surrounding spiritual energy stirred once more.
A massive vortex formed around Qin Sang, continuously drawing in spiritual energy.
He could directly refine spiritual energy to enhance his cultivation, but it was less efficient than absorbing pure toxins!
Qin Sang glanced deeply at the blood pool, his mind settling, locking onto the Serpent King's demon core within his stomach!
The Fat Silkworm's poison core hovered above the demon core, radiating a faint glow as it gently enveloped it.
Qin Sang didn't desire the demon king's power within the core, nor could he refine it in such a short time. He merely wanted to extract the serpent venom using the poison core.
The demon core contained the serpent venom cultivated by the Serpent King, incredibly pure. Refining this venom would allow him to rapidly enhance his cultivation.
He would attempt to break through to Void Refinement here!
Qin Sang understood the immense danger involved. Even if he succeeded, a forced breakthrough would leave significant hidden dangers.
But he had to gamble.
Even if it meant expending ten or a hundred times the effort and time to compensate later, it was better than perishing on the spot!
Having made his decision, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately ruptured the demon core, his internal poison core spinning rapidly, its glow enveloping the demon core and extracting the serpent venom.
Time was of the essence; Qin Sang could only crudely rupture the demon core.
'Boom!'
The demon core's power surged forth like a bursting dam.
Having done this, there was no turning back. Qin Sang couldn't seal the 'demon core's' breach.
The demon core was unconstrained, and how could a mere Nascent Soul withstand the immense power it contained?
If he didn't want to be overwhelmed, Qin Sang had to make choices.
The violent energy, the most valuable part of the demon core, was expelled from his body.
Without the poison core, separating the serpent venom alone would have been difficult. Even so, most of it was wasted.
Qin Sang wasn't worried; this was a demon king's core, and the serpent venom within was more than enough.
As a continuous stream of serpent venom poured into his body, Qin Sang circulated his cultivation technique with all his might.
His cultivation soared at an astonishing rate.
If another cultivator were present, sensing the change in Qin Sang's aura, they would be utterly shocked, suspecting him to be a high-level cultivator who had fallen in realm.
As his cultivation increased, the poison pearl itself, along with Qin Sang's physical body, grew stronger.
Previously, Qin Sang had been meticulous, cultivating for a while, then allowing the poison pearl to devour flower dew to enhance itself, protecting him so he could continue cultivating.
This cycle allowed him and the poison pearl to grow together, benefiting each other.
Now, a flaw emerged.
The poison pearl hadn't been fully enhanced, and the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* hadn't reached the peak of the fifth level. By the time he reached the peak of Nascent Soul, he feared he would exceed the poison pearl's limits.
Then, without any enemy intervention, he would poison himself to death.
It was too late to enhance it now; the poison core required time to absorb potent toxins.
This was the greatest danger.
'Boom! Boom! Boom!'
True essence roared within him, his spiritual sea churned, as violent true essence scoured his meridians.
While refining the venom essence, toxins accumulated relentlessly.
The toxins integrated into his flesh and blood, tempering his physical body, but clearly not at the same pace as they accumulated. Qin Sang was dancing on a knife's edge.
Faced with this danger, he wasn't entirely without recourse.
Firstly, Zuo Zhenren's guidance had deepened his understanding of the Dharma Idol. Utilizing its power to suppress the toxins significantly alleviated the pressure on Qin Sang.
Furthermore, now able to control even spiritual energy, Qin Sang's control over his internal power reached an unprecedented level.
Previously, with such a cultivation speed, his spiritual sea and true essence would have spiraled out of control, effectively destroying his foundation.
Yet Qin Sang persevered, disregarding everything, bordering on madness!
Unfortunately, the crisis still arrived.
The accumulated toxins within him quickly reached a critical level.
Multicolored light emanated from within Qin Sang, radiating outwards.
Even his skin transformed, as if covered in serpent scales, the venom permeating his flesh and blood, his life force rapidly fading.
Qin Sang, oblivious to life and death, showed no signs of stopping.
Finally, as his last vestiges of life were about to vanish, on the verge of becoming a walking corpse, he executed the hand seals he had long prepared.
Inner Lion Seal!
'Swish!'
The multicolored light instantly vanished, his body fully restored!
However, the recovery was temporary, and Qin Sang had to overcome the heavenly tribulation before the Inner Lion Seal's power dissipated.
His urgency mirrored his rapidly surging cultivation.
He was getting closer and closer to the peak of Nascent Soul.
Suddenly…
'Crack!'
A cracking sound jolted Qin Sang awake.
It was the poison core!
Qin Sang was horrified.
It had absorbed too much serpent venom too quickly, exceeding its limit, resulting in a crack across its surface.
'Crack, crack, crack…'
More cracks appeared.
Finally…
'Snap!'
The poison core shattered.
Liu Ying and Fat Silkworm's parting gift was destroyed.
Qin Sang was filled with immense regret.
No one understood the poison core's potential better than him. Worthy of its divine silkworm bloodline, the core was far from its limit, yet it was ruined here.
Without the poison core, he could never have achieved such astonishing progress in the Nascent Soul realm.
In fact, when Tian Yue Shangren discovered Qin Sang's concurrent cultivation of poison techniques, setting the *Poison God Canon* scheme in motion, he hadn't anticipated Qin Sang's cultivation speed far exceeding his estimations, forcing him to accelerate his plan.
"Ah!"
Qin Sang roared towards the heavens, his hair and beard flying wildly, resembling a crazed demon.
His cultivation finally reached the peak of Nascent Soul, and after barely a pause, he shattered the bottleneck to Void Refinement!
