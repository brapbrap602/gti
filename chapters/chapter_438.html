Chapter 431:  Unjustified Wrath


‘Ding…’
The token rolled on the ground, then vanished.

A chilling, languid laugh echoed through the hall.  “Humph… Old Fang and that old Shen Tu, they wouldn’t leave me alone, even here I’m not safe…”

The next moment, a figure materialized before everyone.

The person was tall and slender, appearing to be no more than twenty years old, exceptionally handsome. His dazzling smile held an undercurrent of darkness.

The token was somehow in his hand.

No one sensed any fluctuation.  Only when the figure appeared did everyone realize with a start who he was: Pei Qin, the Jindan cultivator!

‘Swish!’

Pei Qin extended a hand, seizing the unconscious cultivator.  He grasped the man’s neck, a swirling mass of multicolored light emanating from his palm and flowing into the cultivator’s body.

A groan followed.

The cultivator regained consciousness, but his face contorted with immense pain.

Pei Qin lifted the cultivator’s chin, forcing his eyes open.

Their gazes met. The cultivator froze, his suffering intensifying, his body convulsing.

A strange light flickered in Pei Qin’s eyes as he used some peculiar method to interrogate him.

After a moment,

The cultivator fell unconscious again.

Pei Qin coldly snorted, tossing the cultivator to the gatekeeper before his form shimmered and seemed about to vanish.  He paused, then turned, his gaze sweeping across the hall, a sinister smile playing on his lips.

“Xiaohan Domain is in danger; all cultivators must answer the call! Disciples of the Eight Great Righteous Sects, heed my command! Follow me to the area 200 li south of the  Turbulent Islands waters to meet the enemy. Others, do as you please – just run north. Don’t even think about playing games. I remember your faces.  If I don't see you on the battlefield, and I find out… we'll see if those sanctimonious elders will truly uphold justice and punish their own! Hehe…”

His voice still reverberated through the hall as Pei Qin disappeared.

Silence descended.

Suddenly, a figure dashed towards a stone house, followed by the ‘whoosh, whoosh’ sound of cultivators outside the Eight Great Righteous Sects frantically fleeing towards the exit.

Only a few remained, frozen in place, exchanging uneasy glances.

Before leaving, those cultivators cast meaningful looks at them – pity, mockery, schadenfreude…

Qin Sang’s face darkened.

The exit was within reach, yet his legs felt weighted down with lead.

At the last moment, Qin Sang felt Pei Qin’s gaze piercing his mask. It wasn't a high-quality artifact; it couldn't block a Jindan cultivator’s divine sense. Qin Sang hadn't anticipated the wrath of a Jindan cultivator.

His true face had been seen; there was no turning back.

If Pei Qin truly followed through, even Qi Yuanshou couldn't protect him.


Finally, only a few remained. The gatekeeper bowed slightly. “Fellow Daoists, this trading fair concludes here. Please feel free to depart.”

Then he left.

The disciples of the Eight Great Righteous Sects were surprisingly few at this trading fair, only nine including Qin Sang. He hadn't found any fellow disciples from Shaohua Mountain.

Fortunately, disciples from the Eight Great Righteous Sects were undoubtedly strong and well-cultivated; three of the nine were at the late Foundation Establishment stage.

“I am Cang Ling of the Pure Yang Sect.  May I know the names of the two Daoist friends?”

Seeing one of the late Foundation Establishment cultivators turn, Qin Sang knew further concealment was futile.

He removed his mask. “Qin Sang of Shaohua Mountain!”

“Fan Zhen of the Yuan Shen Sect.”

Another late Foundation Establishment cultivator removed their hood, not looking at Qin Sang, coldly stating their name.

Qin Sang's heart stirred. Since Senior Qingzhu attacked the Yuan Shen Sect, killing two Jindan cultivators, Shaohua and Yuan Shen had nearly gone to war. They had managed to restrain themselves, preventing conflict, but their relationship had plummeted.

The disciples of the two sects despised each other.

Having encountered few Yuan Shen Sect cultivators in Xuanlu Pass and Qingyang Market, this confirmed his suspicions.

Qin Sang wouldn’t try to force a friendly exchange with such a person. He ignored Fan Zhen and bowed to Cang Ling. “Daoist Cang possesses the highest cultivation and likely has a plan already. Please share it, and I will follow your orders.”

Cang Ling sighed. “That senior’s wrath has fallen upon us, and they didn’t reveal any information about the situation ahead. We are completely in the dark. I can’t think of a plan. However, we can’t stay here. If we’re late and miss the battle, he will surely find another reason to blame us.”


If no one objects to the order, let's set off and discuss strategy along the way…”

This statement from Cang Ling only fueled the resentment simmering within the group.

Someone gritted their teeth, “Judging by his actions, he’s most likely from a demonic sect!”

“What the senior said wasn't entirely wrong. Xiao Han faces hardship; we cultivators have a duty to act, hehe…”

An old man chuckled dryly, his face falling when met with silence.

Did he even believe his own words?

Qin Sang glanced at the old man askance, saying, “Everyone, watch your words! Daoist Cang is right. Regardless, we must proceed. Let's go…”

Qin Sang and Cang Ling were the first to leave the hall, followed by the others.

The Yun Cang Marsh presented a boundless expanse of water and sky, dotted with countless islands.

Fish swam below, birds soared above, a scene of tranquility.

No sign of the impending battle was visible.

“Don’t be discouraged.  Since it’s not a full-scale attack, the Tian Xing League’s forces may not be that strong. Besides, Senior Fang and the others wouldn't have only summoned us for help. Senior Fang and the others will handle the Foundation Establishment cultivators. Let’s wait for an opportunity. If we can seize the initiative and kill a few of the Tian Xing League’s scoundrels, we’ll gain great merit. If it's impossible, we'll fight and retreat, seeking a chance to escape. We can give a plausible explanation to our sect later. What do you all think?”


The group formed a simple battle formation, concealing their auras, and flew south.

Cang Ling's words perfectly aligned with Qin Sang's thoughts.  Seeing the others’ expressions, they also seemed inclined to agree.

Qin Sang prepared himself, gazing into the distance, pondering silently.  He preferred not to work with others; it limited his ability to use his treasures and significantly weakened his strength.

But if his life was at stake, he wouldn't hesitate; his life came first.

But in this vast world, where could he possibly flee to?


Qin Sang collected his thoughts. Observing the vast expanse of the Stone and Water region, realizing that it would take a while to reach the battlefield, he seized the opportunity to transmit a voice message to Cang Ling: “Daoist Cang, do you know a fellow Daoist Han from your sect? He was the clan head of the Han family, and a friend of mine. I haven't seen him in years. I wonder how he is…”

“Daoist Qin, you mean Senior Brother Han? Of course, I do!”

Cang Ling laughed heartily, a hint of envy in his voice, “Senior Brother Han is incredibly gifted and has had enviable opportunities. He was accepted as a closed-door disciple by one of our senior uncles and is being carefully tutored in the secluded cultivation cave. It’s said that he's about to achieve perfect cultivation and is preparing for Foundation Establishment… Daoist Qin, the next time you see Senior Brother Han, he'll likely be a Golden Core cultivator!”
