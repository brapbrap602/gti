<h1>Chapter 777: Blocked at the Gate</h1><p>Racing along the way, Qin Sang encountered various凶兽  and stumbled upon secluded spots resembling thatched huts. However, none presented an opportunity as golden as the encounter with the red-tailed crane.  He had to consistently avoid other cultivators. After numerous detours, he finally caught sight of the Sky Tower.</p><p>The Sky Tower stood solitary in a flat, open space, resembling a plaza.  No other structures occupied this plaza, though Qin Sang noticed numerous ruined walls and foundations on the surrounding mountains.</p><p>Lacking protective barriers, these structures had long since crumbled.  However, the remnants hinted at the impressive scale of ancient halls that once stood there, suggesting this area was a significant location for the Seven Kills Sect.</p><p>The scene matched the images he'd seen in the crystal obtained from Du Han.</p><p>The difference was the absence of falling ancient corpses from the sea of clouds this time.</p><p>Fifty years of arduous waiting had culminated in this return!</p><p>What had transpired within the Sky Tower all those years ago? Why had he fallen from the tower only to mysteriously reappear in the Western Frontier?</p><p>His Two-Headed Vulture had returned to the Unity Ring to slumber.  Standing on the mountain peak, Qin Sang observed the base of the Sky Tower. The initial joy in his eyes faded, replaced by a look of uncertainty.</p><p>Dozens of cultivators had gathered in the open space below the Sky Tower. They neither entered the tower nor departed.</p><p>Some stood together in small groups, while others sat alone in meditation.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the crowd but didn't spot Xiang Yi or his companions.</p><p>These cultivators glanced up at the Sky Tower entrance from time to time, their expressions betraying varying degrees of anxiety.  Yet, none dared to enter directly.</p><p>An elderly man stood at the tower's entrance, like a guardian deity.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the elder.  His attire clearly marked him as a Wu Tribe cultivator.</p><p>The elder's aura was subtle, devoid of overt power. He stood motionless at the entrance.</p><p>From afar, he appeared like an ordinary old man without cultivation.</p><p>This very unassuming appearance heightened Qin Sang's vigilance.  This individual could very well be a Nascent Soul ancestor of the Wu Tribe; otherwise, so many cultivators wouldn't remain outside, hesitant to cross the invisible boundary.</p><p>He never anticipated such a scene after his arduous journey to the Sky Tower.</p><p>A sense of unease washed over Qin Sang.  "The Wu Tribe has also entered the Seven Kills Sect, and their target is this tower as well?  Are they planning to monopolize the Sky Tower, barring others from entry? This is outright tyranny!"</p><p>Qin Sang observed the cultivators outside, noticing several belonged to the Wu Tribe.</p><p>Their inability to enter the tower, coupled with their reluctance to leave, suggested a more complex situation.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang descended the mountain, quickly reaching the edge of the open space.  Some cultivators noticed his arrival but quickly lost interest.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and approached a kind-looking elderly woman. He bowed slightly.  "Excuse me, Senior… I am Qin. I wish to enter the Sky Tower. May I inquire why so many fellow Daoists are waiting here?"</p><p>"There's no need for formalities, Fellow Daoist Qin. I am Su," the elderly woman replied with a gentle smile. She discreetly gestured towards the figure at the entrance. "Like you, we arrived late and must wait. It's said that Grand Shaman and the Demon Lord entered the Sky Tower earlier and didn't restrict others. However, when other Wu Tribe seniors arrived, they blocked the entrance for reasons unknown. They left this senior to guard it, stating they would allow entry later. Some who challenged this were taught a lesson and suffered greatly…"</p><p>Upon further inquiry, Qin Sang learned the following:</p><p>Initially, the Demon Lord and the Wu Tribe were in a standoff.  Grand Shaman dismissed the other Nascent Soul experts and entered the Sky Tower alone, followed closely by the Demon Lord.</p><p>The other Nascent Soul experts weren't idle, reportedly encountering human Nascent Soul cultivators who seemed to be intercepting them.</p><p>These human cultivators likely served the Demon Lord, tasked with monitoring the Wu Tribe's Nascent Soul experts. Clashes had erupted in several locations, generating considerable commotion.</p><p>Whether casualties resulted remained unknown.</p><p>Later, for an unknown reason, the Wu Tribe Nascent Soul experts returned and entered the Sky Tower, along with several human Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The Demon Lord and Grand Shaman, who entered first, hadn't reappeared.</p><p>No one knew what was happening inside. After witnessing so many Nascent Soul experts enter and the entrance being sealed, some were content to wait.</p><p>A minor ripple from the conflict between the two tribes' Nascent Soul experts could easily end their lives. Waiting for the situation to stabilize before entering might be a wise choice.</p><p>Thanking the elderly woman, Qin Sang walked to the edge of the plaza, frowning.</p><p>Unlike the others, the Sky Tower held the secret of the ancient teleportation formation. Regardless of the dangers within, he couldn't retreat.</p><p>With a Nascent Soul expert guarding the entrance, patience was his only option, despite his urgency.</p><p>The Seven Kills Sect would close in due time; he could only wait and see when they would grant entry.</p><p>"I rushed here with such urgency, only to be blocked at the entrance. I should have taken more time searching along the way. Perhaps I could have found some spirit fruits," Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Returning now was impractical; he could only continue to wait.</p><p>After a moment of thought, he remembered the Golden Yao Lock he had acquired but hadn't yet refined. This opportunity would allow him to complete the refinement, providing an additional means of defense within the Sky Tower.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang entered the forest, leaving behind a Corpse Puppet to observe the situation. Finding a secluded spot, he set up an isolation formation.</p><p>He first retrieved the Golden Radiance Armor.</p><p>The armor was covered in dents. With his refining skills, repairs wouldn't be difficult, and he possessed the necessary spirit materials in his Thousand Weights Ring. However, time was limited.</p><p>He sat down, focusing his mind inward to examine the Golden Yao Lock.</p><p>Within his dantian, the Golden Yao Lock was enveloped in his Dantian Fire.  The continuous refinement had erased the previous owner's mark, rendering it an ownerless treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly familiarized himself with the artifact's properties and began the refinement process using his divine sense and true essence.</p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang opened his eyes, retrieved the Golden Yao Lock, and stood up.</p><p>At the edge of the forest, his Corpse Puppet faced two individuals.</p><p>One was the elderly woman he had spoken with earlier, and the other was a middle-aged man.</p><p>The Corpse Puppet only possessed Foundation Establishment cultivation, a simple creation of Qin Sang's. These two could easily destroy it, but they hadn't, patiently waiting instead, seemingly without malicious intent.</p><p>Sensing this, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, deactivated the formation, and walked out.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin," the elderly woman greeted him with a joyful expression.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Su," Qin Sang nodded and turned to the other person. "And this is…?"</p><p>To his surprise, the middle-aged man was a Wu Tribe cultivator.</p><p>The man stepped forward. "Fellow Daoist Qin, I am Di.  Please forgive this intrusion.  Fellow Daoist Su and I have come to invite you to join forces and enter the Sky Tower together."</p>
