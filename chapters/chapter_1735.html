<h1>Chapter 1726: The Radiant Gold Sword Cavern</h1><p>The Western Lands were besieged by firestorms on all sides, the environment of nearly the entire realm mirroring the Western Desert.  Oases and living creatures were scarcely visible in the border regions, with moisture only gradually increasing towards the center, yet still far from abundant. Compared to other realms, the entire Western Lands were arid and desolate.</p><p>Cultivators, like mortals, settled near water.  Of the major realms Qin Sang had travelled, the Northern Sea and the Canglang Sea were largely oceanic, but even they offered far more habitable land than the Western Lands.  The Western Lands were the most sparsely populated and presented the harshest conditions for mortal survival.</p><p>En route to the Great Compassion Monastery, Qin Sang intentionally slowed his escape speed to experience the local customs and traditions, discovering that the Buddhist Dharma flourished here. The Western Lands' Buddhist sects differed slightly from those of the Middle Continent.</p><p>Passing through oases, Qin Sang frequently encountered Buddhist disciples. These disciples traveled the world, channeling water vapor to nourish the land and sparing the mortals of the Western Lands from displacement due to the disappearance of oases.  During discussions with Master Zhitan and others, Qin Sang learned that within the Western Lands' Buddhist sects, some temple monks dedicated their lives to universal salvation, putting their beliefs into practice. Some attained enlightenment through their actions, becoming true Holy Monks, while others, possessing exceptional talent, inadvertently hindered their own cultivation.</p><p>Of course, the Western Lands were not solely the domain of Buddhist sects; other Dao traditions existed, but their strength paled in comparison.</p><p>While traveling, Qin Sang and Master Huaiyin exchanged insights into their respective body refinement practices. Qin Sang had intended to consult Master Huaiyin on this matter, and the latter's initiative was naturally most welcome.  Qin Sang had cultivated the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement Scripture* to the mid-fourth transformation. In terms of realm, he was only slightly inferior to Master Huaiyin, qualifying him for an exchange rather than a one-sided consultation.  Moreover, one cultivated Buddhist Dharma and the other demonic arts, two distinct lineages. Their mutual validation proved beneficial to both.</p><p>The two conversed with great enthusiasm, leaving the others somewhat neglected.</p><p>From Master Huaiyin, Qin Sang learned that body refinement techniques had existed within the Great Compassion Monastery since ancient times. However, limited by the cultivation environment of this realm, pure body cultivators like Master Huaiyin were extremely rare.</p><p>"Master, your dedication to the path of body refinement and your achievements are truly admirable," Qin Sang praised sincerely.</p><p>Master Huaiyin showed no pride. Looking at Qin Sang with profound meaning, he said, "Our monastery's ability to preserve the Dharma Protector Vajra lineage is not solely due to the completeness of our methods. There is another reason…"</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing the unusual tone, his eyes flickered. "May I inquire as to the reason?" As he spoke, he glanced at Master Zhitan beside him. He could easily guess that this must be a secret of the Great Compassion Monastery, something that would never be revealed to an outsider under normal circumstances. Master Huaiyin's initiative clearly aimed to prompt his question.</p><p>Master Zhitan smiled without speaking, showing no intention of stopping Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin pressed his palms together. "Our monastery possesses a secret place called the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern, possibly a site where ancient sword cultivators sparred or battled. Over time, the sword intent within the cavern dissipated, but for unknown reasons, the sword energy mutated, transforming into Radiant Gold Sword Energy, which persists to this day. In fact, it can no longer be called sword energy. Sword cultivators cannot comprehend the peerless sword techniques of ancient sword cultivators from it. However, for body cultivators like us, it is an invaluable treasure trove. Absorbing Radiant Gold Sword Energy within the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern and using it to temper the physique yields twice the result with half the effort! Without the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern, I fear I would have faced greater tribulations before reaching my current cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang did not expect Master Huaiyin to reveal the origin and function of the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern so readily. Wasn't this an invitation for him to visit the cavern?  Elevating the realm of the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement Scripture* was Qin Sang's current priority. Encountering such a treasure trove as the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern was an opportunity not to be missed.  He also understood that the other party's disclosure of the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern must have an ulterior motive.</p><p>Having reached the pinnacle of this realm, Qin Sang was unafraid of others' schemes. He immediately said, "I cannot deceive Master's discerning eye. I am indeed seeking such an opportunity. I wonder what I must do for your esteemed monastery to allow me to enter the Sword Cavern?"</p><p>"If the True Monarch commands, our monastery will naturally open its doors wide! After meeting with the abbots of various temples, I will immediately escort the True Monarch to the cavern."  Master Huaiyin declared decisively, then his tone shifted.  "However…"</p><p>"Huaiyin," Master Zhitan suddenly interrupted, turning to Qin Sang.  "Let me speak to the True Monarch about my matter myself. I wish to request the True Monarch's protection!"</p><p>"Protection?" Qin Sang was slightly taken aback, suddenly understanding something, his face revealing surprise. "Master, do you intend to attempt a breakthrough to Nascent Soul now?"</p><p>Given the strength of the Great Compassion Monastery, what else in this realm would require external protection? Qin Sang could only think of this possibility.</p><p>"Indeed!" Master Zhitan nodded.</p><p>"This… Master, why the rush?"  Qin Sang truly hadn't expected anyone to willingly attempt a breakthrough knowing about the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound.</p><p>Unless one's lifespan was nearing its end, or the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation was imminent and they knew they couldn't survive it, with the news of the Ascension Platform brought by Qin Sang, this realm had renewed hope. Why not delay for a while?</p><p>"I have long begun preparations for the Nascent Soul breakthrough, accumulating momentum for an entire tribulation cycle. The time will be ripe in three years, and I should seize the opportunity to break through in one go. As the saying goes, the moon waxes and wanes. The opportunity has arrived; delay is futile. Success will allow me to join hands with the True Monarch to overcome this realm's great calamity. Failure will serve as a warning to those who follow, that the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound cannot be underestimated, and that full support for the True Monarch is the only hope for survival," Master Zhitan said, his palms pressed together, his expression calm.</p><p>Worry flickered in the eyes of Master Huaiyin and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang had sensed it before. After he had Master Xingji inform Poison King and others about the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, they hadn't fully believed it. Some likely considered it alarmist.  If it weren't for the lure of the Ascension Platform, they might not have put in their full effort.</p><p>The root cause lay in the anomaly that was Qin Sang.  Who, having reached this level of cultivation, would consider themselves inferior to others, believing their own character to be lacking?  If Qin Sang could succeed, why couldn't they? There were other treasures in the world besides Soul Calming Incense. With sufficient preparation, success might not be impossible.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang couldn't explain the underlying reasons.</p><p>"Master, do you possess Soul Calming Incense?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Master Zhitan nodded. "I obtained the formula from Holy Venerable Huiguang years ago and refined a single stick. Regrettably, the spiritual herbs required for high-grade Soul Calming Incense are exceptionally rare. Our monastery has searched the entire Western Lands but couldn't gather them all.  In addition, our monastery possesses a supreme Buddhist treasure capable of protecting my Primordial Spirit and resisting the harm brought by the Demonic Wind, allowing me to face the Heart Devil Tribulation in optimal condition. However, this treasure requires another to wield it, providing protection from a distance. The higher the cultivator's level, the greater the effect.  I request the True Monarch's assistance to wield this treasure. Rest assured, True Monarch, this is a tribulation-crossing secret treasure. It will not cause the Heavenly Tribulation to affect you, only greatly consume your True Essence."  Master Zhitan explained in detail.</p><p>Such a treasure actually existed in this world.</p><p>It was extremely difficult for cultivators to borrow strength during the Heavenly Tribulation. External intervention would not only cause the Heavenly Tribulation to mutate and intensify, but the intervener would also be affected.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang immediately thought of Liuli and hurriedly inquired, only to be disappointed.  This treasure, called the Vidyaraja Diagram, depicted the image of Acala Vidyaraja. It was a secret treasure passed down through the Great Compassion Monastery. Only those who cultivated the fundamental techniques of the Great Compassion Monastery could receive its protective power. Even Master Huaiyin, from the same sect, couldn't use it.</p><p>It was said that there were originally three tribulation-crossing diagrams, each corresponding to one of the Three Disasters. The other two were incomplete. The Western Lands Buddhist sects emphasized cultivating the heart and desired the other two diagrams more.  Unexpectedly, the Vidyaraja Diagram was now the most crucial.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Without hesitation, he agreed decisively, "Rest assured, Master, I will certainly lend my assistance!"</p><p>The monks rejoiced at his words.</p><p>"Since the two Masters have brought these matters up, I will no longer conceal my intentions. My purpose in coming here was to consult Master Huaiyin about a secret technique, the one Master Huaiyin employed at Emperor Bestowal Mountain to reverse injuries. I am also preparing for the future. If I am forced to travel east to the Ruins of Return, having this secret technique for protection will offer a glimmer of hope."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke sincerely.  "Rest assured, Master, I will not take advantage of your situation. My desire for this secret technique will not be intertwined with these two matters. Regardless, I will dedicate myself to assisting Master in crossing the tribulation."</p><p>Master Zhitan nodded. "I trust the True Monarch. However, this secret technique is a true transmission of Huaiyin's lineage, so it depends on his decision."</p><p>"Upon returning to the monastery, I will impart the *Inner Lion Seal* to the True Monarch," Master Huaiyin agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression eased slightly. "Master, do you have any requests?"</p><p>Master Huaiyin hesitated for a moment, then shook his head.  "If the Ascension Platform is found, I only ask that the True Monarch leave a place for me beside it. I have no other requests."</p><p>As they spoke, the Great Compassion Monastery came into view.  It was built on the shores of a lake, the largest in the Western Lands. Standing on the shore, one couldn't see the opposite bank, mistaking it for an ocean.</p><p>Upon their arrival, the abbots of various temples had been waiting at the Great Compassion Monastery for a long time.</p><p>Nominally, it was a Water and Land Dharma Assembly. Qin Sang appeared at the assembly, repeating what he had done in the Middle Continent.</p><p>After the assembly concluded, Master Zhitan entered secluded cultivation, awaiting his breakthrough in three years. Master Huaiyin led Qin Sang to the meditation hall to impart the technique.</p><p>Within the meditation hall, the two sat facing each other on meditation cushions.  Master Huaiyin transmitted the technique through a mind seal, extending a finger towards Qin Sang's brow. A golden light flew out, and Qin Sang slowly closed his eyes as a profound and mysterious technique emerged in his mind.</p><p>"*Inner Lion Seal*…"</p><p>As Qin Sang comprehended the technique, Master Huaiyin's voice entered his ears, ethereal and distant.</p><p>"The *Inner Lion Seal* is one of the nine legendary Bright Seals.  These nine Bright Seals are said to have some connection to the Daoist tradition, but their origins are lost to time.  Each seal has a different function, possessing profound magical powers.  Our monastery only has the transmission of the *Inner Lion Seal*, and even then, only half the seal…"</p><p>"Even half the seal possesses exceptional power.  With the True Monarch's current physical realm, you should be able to barely utilize it."</p><p>"You can consider this seal's function as self-restoration.  Even if you suffer grievous injuries that harm your foundation, as long as you have the time to form the seal, you can swiftly recover, turning defeat into victory, even reversing life and death, just as I did that day…"</p><p>"However, because it is only half the seal, the technique has limitations that cannot be ignored."</p><p>"First, the seal can only be used once per injury. Repeated use will cause backlash, potentially leading to the collapse of your physical body."</p><p>"Second, after using the seal, it is best to leave the dangerous situation as quickly as possible because this isn't true restoration. After the seal's duration expires, the injuries will rapidly worsen, becoming even more severe than before."</p><p>…</p><p>Combining Master Huaiyin's guidance with his own comprehension, Qin Sang quickly gained a general understanding of the *Inner Lion Seal*, marveling at its profoundness.  He couldn't help but wonder how powerful the complete *Inner Lion Seal* would be.</p><p>As Master Huaiyin had said, this technique couldn't truly heal injuries, but it could still save his life at a critical moment.</p><p>"Thank you, Master, for imparting the technique," Qin Sang rose and bowed.</p><p>He didn't comprehend the *Inner Lion Seal* immediately. There would be ample time later while traversing the storms.</p><p>Come to think of it, this was the second Buddhist seal he had acquired. He had previously obtained the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal* from the Pure Sea Sect, which, while not as profound as the *Inner Lion Seal*, was a technique for slaughter.</p><p>Qin Sang had already mastered the Auspicious Seal, Lotus Seal, Wheel Platform Seal, and Demon Subduing Seal. After his breakthrough, he could cultivate the fifth and sixth seals, the Vajra Great Wisdom Seal and the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal, respectively.</p><p>Master Huaiyin also rose and said, "I will now open the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern. For these three years, the True Monarch can cultivate within the cavern."</p><p>With that, Master Huaiyin led Qin Sang away from the Great Compassion Monastery.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern was located within the lake before the temple.</p><p>The two descended deep without needing True Essence for protection.  Qin Sang estimated they were nearing the lakebed when Master Huaiyin ahead formed a hand seal.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the fluctuations of Buddhist restrictions, then saw a faint Buddhist light emerge from the dark lakebed. Beneath the light was a mountain!  It turned out they were far from the bottom; the true lakebed lay beneath this mountain.</p><p>"The vicissitudes of life…" Qin Sang sighed inwardly, following Master Huaiyin through the restriction into a cavern.</p><p>The water vapor was blocked outside, leaving the cavern dry.</p><p>Standing at the entrance, Qin Sang already sensed an extremely sharp aura within the cavern. Before even seeing the so-called Radiant Gold Sword Energy, he felt the illusion of being pierced by a myriad of swords!</p><p>When he finally saw the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern, he couldn't help but pause and gaze for a long time.</p><p>Blinding golden light filled the cavern.  Streaks of Radiant Gold Sword Energy, almost tangible, moved freely within, resembling real golden swords.</p><p>Master Huaiyin instructed him not to resist the sword energy, allowing it to pierce his body, almost masochistically letting it tear at his flesh!</p><p>"Not only does this have the effect of cleansing the meridians and marrow, breaking down and rebuilding, but the peculiar energy within the sword energy, which I call Radiant Gold Qi, can also be integrated into the body, strengthening the physique.  The True Monarch has already reached Nascent Soul cultivation. As long as you can endure the pain, using True Essence for protection and absorbing more Radiant Gold Sword Energy, the effect should far surpass mine back then…"</p><p>Master Huaiyin stepped into the cavern, allowing the sword energy to penetrate his body.  Golden light flashed on him, yet his expression remained undisturbed.</p><p>He mentioned "back then" because he had already refined the Xin Metal Origin Crystal. He was no longer the same and now absorbed Geng Metal Qi roaming the void. This Radiant Gold Sword Cavern no longer held much significance for him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and stepped into the cavern.  A streak of Radiant Gold Sword Energy immediately struck him.  Suppressing his True Essence, he allowed the Radiant Gold Sword Energy to pierce his flesh, a tearing pain washing over him.</p><p>He focused on experiencing it. After the intense pain, a strange energy seemed to merge into his body.</p><p>Master Huaiyin instructed Qin Sang on how to absorb the Radiant Gold Sword Energy before taking his leave.</p><p>Cultivation within the sword cavern transcended the passage of time. In the blink of an eye, three years passed.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
