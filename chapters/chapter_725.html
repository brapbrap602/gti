<h1>Chapter 717: Divided Focus</h1><p>After some deliberation, Qin Sang had a plan.</p><p>Could he utilize both his Gold Core and Corpse Core to simultaneously activate two magical treasures?</p><p>This way, while engaging an opponent with one treasure, he could seize the opportune moment to unleash the other, catching them off guard.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang embarked on a lengthy period of experimentation.</p><p>Simultaneously activating two treasures was more than just dividing one's attention; it placed immense strain on a cultivator's divine sense and true essence.</p><p>While the Corpse Core provided ample true essence, the challenge lay in preventing the two distinct energies from clashing within his body after unsealing the Corpse Core. He needed them to coexist harmoniously and function without disrupting each other when activating the treasures.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang was clueless.</p><p>Upon unsealing the Corpse Core and attempting to manipulate both types of true essence concurrently, his dantian and meridians became a battlefield. The most severe incident nearly resulted in severe damage to his dantian.</p><p>Undeterred, Qin Sang persisted with various attempts.  After an incredibly long period of trial and error, he finally found a breakthrough, a glimmer of hope.</p><p>He discovered that to simultaneously manipulate both types of true essence, his divine sense had to be sufficiently powerful.  The current bottleneck seemed to lie within his divine sense.</p><p>Although his divine sense was superior to cultivators of the same realm due to cultivating the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter," it was still insufficient.</p><p>Moreover, the divine sense not only influenced true essence control but also played a crucial role in activating two treasures simultaneously, demanding even greater strength.</p><p>Excited, Qin Sang dedicated even more effort, allocating a portion of his cultivation time to experimenting with various divine sense strengthening techniques he had acquired previously.  Unfortunately, these techniques were not particularly profound, and their effects were limited.</p><p>Nevertheless, as time passed, he finally managed to allow both types of true essence to coexist within his body!</p><p>Although he couldn't merge the two drastically different essences, this was enough to invigorate Qin Sang. He immediately began experimenting with dividing his focus to activate two treasures.</p><p>To date, he had achieved some success.</p><p>While using the Ebony Sword to besiege the Two-Headed Serpent, Qin Sang had already prepared the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>He couldn't yet simultaneously wield both treasures in combat, but while using the Ebony Sword, he could now stealthily deploy the Ten Yama Banners for an instantaneous strike.</p><p>Previously, this required preparation time, potentially leaving him vulnerable to counterattacks.</p><p>Relying on this newfound ability, Qin Sang had been waiting for the perfect opportunity. When the Two-Headed Serpent was cornered and about to self-destruct its demon core, he unleashed the demonic banners, engulfing the protective light and the demon core in Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the Two-Headed Serpent trembled in fear, despite its resolve to die.</p><p>Anything that could unsettle a creature resigned to death must represent an even more gruesome fate.</p><p>It tried to detonate its demon core, but it was too late.  The Nine Nether Demonic Fire effortlessly penetrated the protective light and assaulted the demon core, its luster instantly dimming.</p><p>The Two-Headed Serpent shrieked in agony as its demon core was directly struck by the demonic fire.  Qing Jiao and the Flying Night Devil seized the opportunity, launching a relentless attack from both sides.</p><p>凄厉 howls echoed amidst the churning waves.</p><p>When the storm subsided, the Two-Headed Serpent lay battered and defeated on the water's surface, pinned down by its neck.  Still clinging to life, it refused to yield, its two heads stubbornly raised, glaring at Qin Sang with venomous hatred.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared beside the Two-Headed Serpent in a flash.</p><p>At that moment, Qing Jiao swam to Qin Sang's feet, looking at him nervously.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Qing Jiao, tapped his dantian, and a clear ringing sound echoed. The Yang Ring on Qing Jiao's neck vibrated gently and detached itself, flying back into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Qing Jiao shook its head, finally realizing the restraints were gone.</p><p>It could hardly believe it. The shackles it thought it would bear for life were so easily removed?</p><p>Qing Jiao plunged into the deep water, resurfacing far away. Seeing Qin Sang made no attempt to pursue it but merely watched calmly, it finally believed it was truly free.</p><p>Qing Jiao took one last look at Qin Sang, let out a long cry, and with only its sharp dorsal fin visible, gradually swam away, eventually disappearing from sight.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Qing Jiao depart.</p><p>He spared its life for two reasons. First, Qing Jiao had served him diligently for many years. Second, his recent gains were plentiful; one demon core more or less made little difference.</p><p>The Two-Headed Serpent, witnessing this scene, understood the function of the Mixed Yuan Concentric Ring.</p><p>It struggled fiercely, but it was already spent, easily subdued by the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the surroundings.  The vicinity seemed calm, with no signs of powerful demons, but he remained cautious.</p><p>From last night until now, he had been pursuing the Two-Headed Serpent and had just engaged in a fierce battle here.  It was possible he had alerted some powerful demon.</p><p>Not daring to linger, Qin Sang ordered the Flying Night Devil to seize the Two-Headed Serpent and quickly departed. They eventually found a calm area of the sea to subdue the Two-Headed Serpent.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, and the Yang Ring flew towards the Two-Headed Serpent, hovering above it.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang sat cross-legged in mid-air, chanting incantations.  The Yang Ring trembled, and ring-shaped shadows flew out from it, descending upon the Two-Headed Serpent.</p><p>The Two-Headed Serpent suddenly froze, becoming rigid and motionless.</p><p>However, the confrontation had just begun.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, focusing all his energy on manipulating the treasure. As more and more ring shadows entered the Two-Headed Serpent, its resistance intensified, demanding Qin Sang's utmost concentration.</p><p>A silent battle raged between them.  Fierce flames flickered within the eyes of the Two-Headed Serpent.</p><p>As time passed, its gaze softened, occasionally losing focus.</p><p>"If I hadn't deliberately cultivated my divine sense, I might not have been able to suppress this beast!"  Qin Sang thought to himself.  Opening his eyes and seeing the bewildered expression of the Two-Headed Serpent, he smiled faintly and commanded, "Descend!"</p><p>The Yang Ring vibrated and abruptly landed on the Two-Headed Serpent's head.</p><p>Instantly, the Two-Headed Serpent's fierce aura vanished completely.  It collapsed onto the sea surface, motionless.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned, and the Flying Night Devil returned to the Corpse Puppet Bag.  He approached the Two-Headed Serpent and discovered that it had collapsed from exhaustion, severe injuries, and the impact of the Mixed Yuan Concentric Ring.</p><p>After examining the Two-Headed Serpent, Qin Sang retrieved a spirit pill and placed it in its mouth.  Then, with a thought, a white light emanated from the Yang Ring.</p><p>In the next moment, the Two-Headed Serpent disappeared, and a slender bracelet appeared on Qin Sang's wrist.</p><p>The Two-Headed Serpent was subdued.  Fortunately, Qin Sang still had plenty of pills, and it would recover after a period of rest.</p><p>He now had a mid-Demon Core stage mount!</p><p>Even with his excellent composure, Qin Sang couldn't help but smile.  He shook his wrist, summoned his flying light, chose a direction, and soared away.</p>
