<h1>Chapter 1289: Shifting Tides</h1><p>Wangdong City was easy to defend but difficult to attack.</p><p>True Person Canghong, sparing no expense, committed nearly all his forces.  Lord Tongyou, however, was prepared for a fierce battle and remained firmly within the city walls.</p><p>The battle raged for a day and a night, exceptionally brutal.</p><p>Wangdong City remained unconquered.</p><p>True Person Canghong sighed, realizing the situation was hopeless and that they must abandon the siege.</p><p>…</p><p>Shuangjing Mountain.</p><p>Qing Jun received urgent reports and immediately launched a general attack.</p><p>This time, they would exploit the enemy’s fear and low morale, vowing not to rest until Shuangjing Mountain fell!</p><p>The attacks were repeatedly repelled, but after brief respites, they struck again.  Simultaneously, Qing Jun ordered the widespread dissemination of news about Ye Laomo’s rout, to sow chaos among the Zuoyuan forces.</p><p>Qin Sang bore a heavy responsibility.</p><p>Qing Jun commanded the Xunfeng Grand Array, deciphering the patterns of Shuangjing Mountain's protective array; he had to personally intercept Zuoyuan's top experts.</p><p>Immortaless Qiu Zhi, confident in her abilities to counter Qin Sang, entrusted the array to a Single-surname cultivator and personally engaged Qin Sang, attempting to kill him.</p><p>While entangled with Immortaless Qiu Zhi, Qin Sang remained vigilant, using nearly all his skills.  He survived, though greatly depleted and barely holding on.</p><p>Fortunately, as night fell, Jing Yu, having received the news, finally arrived on the battlefield, relieving Qin Sang.</p><p>The tide gradually turned in favor of the Two Realms Alliance.</p><p>The all-night battle, culminating with the arrival of reinforcements sent by Daoist Zhen, proved to be the final straw.</p><p>"I can only retrieve this much."</p><p>A Song-surname cultivator handed over a jade slip. During the outbreak of the battle, he had been arranging a retreat.</p><p>The jade slip listed what could be salvaged. Compared to the resources in Shuangjing Mountain's treasury, it was a negligible amount.  Unfortunately, the situation arose suddenly, leaving no better option.</p><p>The Zuoyuan Yuan Ying cultivators felt the pain keenly upon seeing the list, but there was nothing they could do.</p><p>Ye Laomo's defeat was unexpected by both sides. Originally, Zuoyuan could have retreated calmly, but now all their plans had been completely disrupted.</p><p>The battlefield’s situation took an unforeseen turn due to this change.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Immortaless Qiu Zhi was decisive, her slightly furrowed brow betraying her inner frustration.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Numerous Youjing Towers rose from the ground.</p><p>Within the Xunfeng Grand Array, Qing Jun detected Zuoyuan's movements. His gaze sharpened, he flicked his jade fingers, sending several beams of light into the battlefield.  Simultaneously, his incantations changed abruptly, creating nine thick pillars of wind that crashed into the Sky Lake.</p><p>‘Rumble! Rumble!’</p><p>The mountains trembled.</p><p>The Xunfeng Grand Array tore through the Sky Lake. Qing Jun had discerned the patterns of the mountain-protecting array and launched a general attack. Immortaless Qiu Zhi and the Single-surname cultivator worked together to maintain the array, while others activated the Youjing Towers to cover the army's retreat.</p><p>‘Kill!’</p><p>Unlike the demoralized Zuoyuan forces, the Two Realms Alliance cultivators were immensely invigorated and fought bravely.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to destroy several Youjing Towers when he saw the incoming beams of light. He caught one, a signal from his senior sister.</p><p>Zuoyuan still possessed Youjing Towers; a complete annihilation was unrealistic.  The top priority was Shuangjing Mountain's treasury—they had to find it quickly and prevent its destruction.</p><p>Jing Yu remained with Qin Sang, and others joined them.</p><p>Under Qing Jun's support, they jointly attacked Shuangjing Mountain.</p><p>Upon seeing the mountain's condition, Jing Lin's expression was complex.</p><p>Shuangjing Mountain had been transformed into a fortress by Zuoyuan. Camps stretched across the entire mountain range, erasing all traces of its former appearance.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>Jing Yu's gaze swept across the landscape, locking onto a cluster of palaces.</p><p>Dust billowed; palace after palace collapsed, either destroyed by explosions or engulfed in flames—clearly, someone was deliberately causing destruction.</p><p>According to information from an inside source, that was the location of the treasury!</p><p>"Quick!"</p><p>Everyone immediately flew towards the treasury.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and the others, the Zuoyuan cultivators were horrified, frantically activating protective barriers to stall for time while frantically destroying the treasury.</p><p>At that moment, the treasury's barrier suddenly dimmed, and a cultivator dashed out, shouting, "Junior Fang Qi, esteemed seniors, please enter quickly!"</p><p>He was an inside agent of the Two Realms Alliance, having infiltrated and waited for the opportune moment to disable the barrier.</p><p>"Traitor!"</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>…</p><p>Zuoyuan cultivators cursed Fang Qi, but it was too late to remedy the situation. They scattered and fled. Qin Sang and the others rushed in, finding that about half the treasury had already become ruins; they were secretly relieved.</p><p>Ultimately, Zuoyuan had no choice but to abandon Shuangjing Mountain.</p><p>However, under the protection of the Youjing Towers, Zuoyuan's battle formations remained intact.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance pursued the enemy for some distance, breaking away from the Xunfeng Formation. Seeing that further gains were unlikely, they sounded the retreat and returned to their mountain stronghold for rest.</p><p>Shuangjing Mountain had changed hands.</p><p>The assembled Yuan Ying cultivators gathered at the summit hall, their joy evident.</p><p>"We must hurry to Wangdong City.  The rest is in your capable hands."</p><p>The reinforcements took their leave.  Wangdong City was currently vulnerable, with Lord Tongyou and his forces struggling to defend it.  They had to return and support them immediately; the city’s fall was unacceptable.</p><p>"We are indebted to you, fellow cultivators."</p><p>Qing Jun bowed, inviting the Yin Shan Pass City Lord and others to join them in reinforcing Wangdong City.  While sending Qin Sang and Jing Yu would have ensured success, considering his past with Dongyang Bo, he chose others instead.</p><p>After the battle…</p><p>Shuangjing Mountain lay in ruins.</p><p>After assessing the treasury’s resources and a brief respite, Qing Jun ordered the army to march!</p><p>Speed was of the essence; opportunity wouldn't last.</p><p>Ye Laomo was severely wounded, and the Zuyuan forces were fleeing in disarray, morale plummeting.  They had to press their advantage, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, preventing any recovery.</p><p>Their subsequent advance was unstoppable.  Three armies pressed forward, achieving victory after victory.</p><p>The enemy's defeat was swift and complete.</p><p>Ye Laomo’s prediction seemed to be coming true; they might indeed flee all the way back to Yu City.</p><p>…</p><p>After months of bitter fighting…</p><p>Tianxing Plateau was finally liberated, driving the Zuyuan forces onto the plains.</p><p>Between the Tianxing Plateau and Zuyuan territory lay a narrow plain serving as a buffer zone.  Sparsely populated, it was rich in spiritual ore.  The Tianxing Alliance and Zuyuan had clashed repeatedly over these resources, their conflict deepening over the years.</p><p>On the vast plain…</p><p>At the turn of spring and summer, a gentle breeze caressed the tender green grass, insects buzzed, and birdsong filled the air.  A serene scene.</p><p>Then, in the distance, a white cloud sped towards them, skimming low.</p><p>A bird glanced up, noticing the cloud but showing no concern; it continued its cheerful chirping, unaware of anything unusual.</p><p>Within the cloud were several figures—Yuan Ying masters, including Qin Sang.  While the main armies clashed elsewhere, they were secretly approaching to recapture a mine seized by Zuyuan.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>I'm not skilled at writing war scenes; these chapters feel clumsy. I hope they’re not too jarring. I’ll try to wrap this up soon.</p>
