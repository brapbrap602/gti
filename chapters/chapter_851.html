<h1>Chapter 843: The Last Stand</h1><p>The cultivator didn't pry into Qin Sang's origins, but rather asked him with great interest about the depths of the Demon Sea. Qin Sang was happy to chat with him, not putting on airs due to his higher cultivation level, and answered every question.</p><p>Soon, the two became acquainted.</p><p>As they spoke, they flew down to the harbor on the auxiliary island's shore.</p><p>The moment they landed, Qin Sang's heart was filled with vigilance. He felt several divine senses sweep over him, all belonging to Core Formation stage cultivators.</p><p>He wondered what these people were guarding against, but no one appeared as he followed the cultivator into the city.</p><p>The cultivator seemed accustomed to this, quickly entering the city and heading straight for a large hall.</p><p>Approaching the hall, the cultivator hesitated and whispered, “Friend, you may not know, but Desolation Island has now forbidden everyone from returning to the Azure Wave Sea. Especially high-level cultivators like yourself, who can play a significant role in defending the island, are even less likely to be let go. All cultivators must obey the arrangements of Desolation Island. Don't think about returning to the Azure Wave Sea for now. Think carefully about how to survive this chaotic war…”</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and wasn't surprised. He could only blame himself for being a step too late.</p><p>A guard led Qin Sang into the hall. He saw a middle-aged man in armor with a dignified expression.</p><p>This man's cultivation was at the astonishing late Core Formation stage. Qin Sang didn't dare to be negligent, cupping his hands in salute and introducing himself, “This humble Daoist is known as Qing Feng, a steward of the East Pole Alliance's瓊宇 Trading Company. Greetings, General.”</p><p>Xiang Yi was dead, and the traces had been erased by the beast tide. Qin Sang had no more worries and decided to continue acting as Daoist Qing Feng to contact the 瓊宇 Trading Company.</p><p>Neither finding the Mao Shan vine nor using the teleportation formation to return to the Azure Wave Sea was something a rogue cultivator could accomplish. Perhaps the 瓊宇 Trading Company could help.</p><p>Moreover, in this situation, everyone had to obey orders. Without backing, he was likely to be assigned the most arduous tasks.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's introduction, the general nodded slightly.</p><p>He had already been informed of Qin Sang's purpose and said thoughtfully, “Since you are a high-level cultivator of the East Pole Alliance, you should understand the urgency of the current situation. Without orders from Desolation Island, I dare not directly grant passage. You might as well stay on this island for a while. It just so happens that the patrol guard is short a few commanders…”</p><p>“I obey the general's orders.”</p><p>Qin Sang readily accepted, then added, “However, this humble Daoist has urgent matters and dare not delay. Could the general please help me contact the trading company? After I report back, I can focus on my duties with peace of mind.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's agreeable attitude, the general's expression softened slightly, readily agreeing to his request.</p><p>The general then explained some precautions to Qin Sang, called a guard, and had him settled. Thereafter, Qin Sang stayed on this auxiliary island.</p><p>He frequently took on island defense duties, performing his responsibilities diligently and expertly.</p><p>More than a month passed. To his surprise, the 瓊宇 Trading Company hadn't contacted him.</p><p>“Could something have happened to Elder Zou?”</p><p>Qin Sang worried silently and could only try to make more connections and find his own way.</p><p>Finally, two months after his return, he met Elder Zou.</p><p>“Daoist, why did it take you so long to return! I thought something had happened to you in the Seven Kills Palace. I grieved for a long time, regretting that I should have stopped you from going to that dangerous place!”</p><p>Elder Zou seemed very happy to see Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and explained, “Elder Zou, you don't know. I did indeed encounter a great calamity in the Seven Kills Palace and nearly lost my life. I dragged my injured body out of there, not daring to burden the trading company. I sought a place to heal my injuries for many years before recovering. My cultivation also stagnated. After leaving seclusion, I intended to contact you in the Demon Sea, but unexpectedly encountered this upheaval…”</p><p>After leaving the Seven Kills Palace, he had focused his energy on the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* and *Demonic Seed Embryo* techniques, neglecting his cultivation. Moreover, due to various matters, he had traveled back and forth, and his cultivation had improved slowly.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang's cultivation was indeed as he said, not much improved, Elder Zou didn't inquire further.</p><p>After all, although Qin Sang had joined the 瓊宇 Trading Company, he was an ascetic cultivator with few friends in the company. It was normal for him to be cautious when injured.</p><p>When Elder Zou asked about Qin Sang's experiences in the Seven Kills Palace, Qin Sang presented his prepared explanation.</p><p>“We followed Daoist Xiang Yi into a place called the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, filled with poisonous fog. Daoist Xiang Yi held a poison-repelling treasure, but unexpectedly disturbed the fierce beasts within, causing us to scatter. I was fortunate enough to escape the pursuit and flee the forbidden zone, but I was afflicted by the intense poison, greatly weakening my strength, which led to later troubles…”</p><p>Madam Liu had already investigated.</p><p>Xiang Yi wouldn't voluntarily reveal his despicable actions. After leaving the Seven Kills Palace, this was his explanation to others. Qin Sang's words conveniently matched.</p><p>Eight people had entered the Seven Kills Palace, and only Xiang Yi had come out alive. But the Seven Kills Palace was notorious, and this level of cruelty was expected. Even if someone was suspicious, they couldn't question Xiang Yi based on this.</p><p>As Qin Sang recounted his experiences, Elder Zou listened with relish, showing no sign of interrupting. Qin Sang had to combine his own experiences and what he had seen and heard, weaving a tale of truth and fiction.</p><p>Elder Zou expressed amazement and emotion at times. Suddenly, he cupped his hands towards Qin Sang and said, “The Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, the Celestial Tower, the Flower Fairy Lake… The Seven Kills Palace truly lives up to its reputation. The places you've visited, brother, are all fraught with danger and fearsome. I admire your ability to escape from these perilous lairs! I have an impolite request, I wonder if you could do me a favor?”</p><p>Qin Sang had a favor to ask of Elder Zou, so he said solemnly, “Elder Zou, please speak freely. As long as it's within my capabilities, I will definitely do my best.”</p><p>Elder Zou's eyes lit up, and he exclaimed in approval, saying directly, “I would like to ask you to draw a detailed map!”</p><p>“The places I visited were only a small part of the Seven Kills Palace. If Elder Zou needs it, I have no objections.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Elder Zou with some surprise, “You want a map? Could it be that you’re planning to enter the Seven Kills Palace?”</p><p>Elder Zou smiled wryly and spread his hands, “Look at my cultivation, brother. How many years has it been since I made any progress? After realizing that my path to immortality was hopeless, I devoted all my energy to the trading company, toiling in the Demon Sea for many years. Unexpectedly, this upheaval has destroyed all my foundations, turning them into a fleeting dream. I had already lost heart, but after hearing news of you, I was overjoyed, and a flame was rekindled in my heart. Before my lifespan ends, I want to make one last attempt at the Seven Kills Palace! I heard that the Wu Clan will reopen the Seven Kills Palace in forty years. There isn’t much time left for me. You have personally been inside, your experience is crucial to me. Any information I gather later, I will need your help to verify it.”</p><p>He remembered his first encounter with Elder Zou in the Wu God Continent. Compared to now, his aura hadn't changed much.  He didn't expect that Elder Zou, so absorbed in commerce, would suddenly return to the path of cultivation.</p><p>This upheaval in the Demon Sea had changed the fate of many.</p>
