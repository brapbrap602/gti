<h1>Chapter 946: Cornered</h1><p>The strange bird's strength was equivalent to that of a Nascent Soul early-stage cultivator.</p><p>By using the "Lightning Manipulation Technique," Bai, his avatar, and the Twin-Headed Serpent had a chance to repel the bird. However, doing so would inevitably alert the ferocious beasts below and attract Old Devil Mu.</p><p>In times of desperation, he had to make a choice.</p><p>Once he obtained the Soul Nourishing Wood, his cultivation would no longer be restricted. He believed that the next time he entered the Seven Kills Hall, he could traverse the Sword Path on his own.</p><p>But delays could be dangerous. No one could predict what would happen in a few decades. Unforeseen circumstances might arise.</p><p>Now that he could escape smoothly, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't hesitate.</p><p>He was even more cautious than before, quickly fleeing the rift and heading towards the outer reaches of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>……</p><p>Inside the rift.</p><p>With the strange bird's arrival, a three-way standoff ensued, each party wary of the others.</p><p>Just then, a long howl suddenly came from the direction of the ghostly place. Old Devil Mu, cloaked in cold fire, arrived before these beasts in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In an instant, all the beasts' gazes focused on Old Devil Mu.</p><p>Influenced by the Seven Kills Hall, these beasts were extremely ferocious. Upon discovering Old Devil Mu, whose aura far surpassed theirs and posed the greatest threat, they immediately set aside their grudges and unhesitatingly besieged him.</p><p>The strange bird spread its wings wide, spitting out black light.</p><p>The leader of the dog-like beasts spewed a stream of purple fire.</p><p>The other group of Flood Dragon monsters linked their tails together, their bodies instantly intertwining. Purple energy surged around them as their size swelled, transforming into a true dragon-like being. Its long tail lashed out fiercely, smashing towards Old Devil Mu.</p><p>Suddenly attacked by the beasts, Old Devil Mu was enraged. "Blind beasts! I haven't sought you out, yet you dare block my path? Get back!"</p><p>Old Devil Mu roared, the cold fire armor around him suddenly erupting.</p><p>A sizzling sound rang out, as the purple mist was burned by the Winter Nether Cold Flame. The Winter Nether Cold Flame gathered into a ball, meeting the leader's purple fire head-on.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The cold flames and purple fire collided.</p><p>The two spiritual fires erupted in a terrifying wave, transforming into a two-colored pillar of fire that soared into the sky, even pushing back the purple mist.</p><p>At the same time, a gray cloth bag appeared in Old Devil Mu's hand. He pointed it at the strange bird and the Flood Dragon, and after a quick incantation, countless black sand grains erupted from the bag.</p><p>These grains varied in size, the smallest like dust, the largest no bigger than a grain of rice, yet they were as heavy as a thousand jun, forming a wall that blocked the black light and stopped the Flood Dragon.</p><p>For a moment, the power displayed by Old Devil Mu startled the beasts.</p><p>Old Devil Mu staggered back several feet, his body trembling before he steadied himself.  Directly taking on the attacks of these beasts wasn't as easy as he had claimed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Old Devil Mu didn't even look at the beasts, instead staring intently at a deep pit on the cliff above, the one left by the strange bird's attack on Qin Sang. He seemed to have discovered something.</p><p>Then, he abruptly pushed off the ground and charged towards the cliff face.</p><p>The beasts, encountering such an arrogant opponent for the first time, one who dared to ignore them, were furious.</p><p>"Get out of my way!"</p><p>Old Devil Mu manipulated the demonic fire with one hand and wielded the divine sand with the other, battling the beasts and attempting to force a breakthrough.</p><p>A while later, a furious roar filled with shame and anger echoed from the depths of the rift.</p><p>"Once you fall into my hands, I will make you suffer all the tortures in the world, begging for death but unable to find it!"</p><p>With his experience, seeing the traces was enough for him to understand.</p><p>That guy not only stole the treasure and disrupted the demonic fire, but also escaped right under his nose without him noticing. How could Old Devil Mu not be enraged?</p><p>……</p><p>Above the rift.</p><p>Qin Sang flew at high speed towards the Earthworm Dragon's lair, deliberately avoiding the canyon.</p><p>He sensed the earth-shattering battle happening behind him and could guess the identities of the parties involved.</p><p>He hadn't intervened and had been extremely cautious, leaving no trace except for the marks from the strange bird's attack.</p><p>Even if that Nascent Soul cultivator discovered something, he wouldn't be able to trace it back to him.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang felt relieved.</p><p>Finally, the Earthworm Dragon's lair was in sight.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to enter, the ground suddenly trembled. The sounds of the battle faintly echoed from behind, along with several beast roars he hadn't heard before.</p><p>"Did the fight reach here? Or did that Nascent Soul cultivator shake off those beasts and encounter new opponents? In this direction… Could it be that top-level beast that attacked Lady Liu…?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. That Nascent Soul cultivator's strength was even more terrifying than he had imagined.</p><p>Passing through the cave and arriving on the other side of the high cliff, Qin Sang couldn't help but let out a long sigh, a look of relief on his face.</p><p>The outside world was vast, with countless secret realms and cultivators everywhere. He could hide anywhere, and even with immense divine abilities, no one would be able to find him.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang didn't immediately flee into the ancient forest. Instead, he changed direction, preparing to take a detour and avoid the conflict.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Old Devil Mu, willing to trade injuries and paying a considerable price, finally broke free from the strange bird and the other beasts. Just as he was about to search for the culprit's tracks, another beast was attracted, forcing him into another battle.</p><p>After finally repelling this beast, Old Devil Mu knew that even if the opponent was only at the Core Formation stage, they would have had enough time to escape the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>Thinking of this, Old Devil Mu's expression changed, his rage reaching its peak.</p><p>After some deliberation, he flew straight towards the wasteland where the exit of the Seven Kills Hall was located. Old Devil Mu was confident that with his speed, he could reach the wasteland first.</p><p>When the immortal restriction closed and everyone had to leave, they would inevitably pass through the wasteland.</p><p>Within the forest.</p><p>An elderly Core Formation cultivator was harvesting a spiritual herb.</p><p>The old man had just placed the herb into a jade box, the joy still evident on his face. He seemed to sense something, looking up towards the depths of the forest and listening intently.</p><p>Then, his expression suddenly changed drastically. After looking around, he quickly hid among the roots of an ancient tree, waving his sleeve and releasing a cloud of white smoke.</p><p>As the white smoke enveloped him, the old man vanished into thin air, his presence completely erased.</p><p>The next moment, a gust of wind swept through, and within the wind was a figure – Old Devil Mu.</p><p>Old Devil Mu paused slightly as he passed overhead, glancing down. Suddenly, he clenched his hand, and a surge of spiritual energy shot towards the old man's hiding place with lightning speed.</p><p>White smoke billowed from the tree roots as the old man leaped out, his face filled with terror, transforming into a streak of light and fleeing.</p><p>Old Devil Mu let out a disdainful snort, flicking his finger and sending out a cold flame that transformed into a fiery chain, wrapping around the old man in an instant.</p><p>The old man felt a chilling cold, his body stiffening, unable to resist.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The cold flame dragged the old man back.</p><p>"It's you…"</p><p>The old man recognized Old Devil Mu, his mouth opening slightly. Suddenly, everything went dark, and he let out a bloodcurdling scream.</p><p>A moment later, Old Devil Mu withdrew his hand, stopping the soul search and cursing, "Waste."</p><p>The Winter Nether Cold Flame erupted, instantly incinerating the old man, erasing him from existence.</p><p>The wind picked up again as Old Devil Mu's figure vanished, leaving behind only a咬牙切齿 sentence, "I'll see how far you can run!"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>These two chapters were difficult to write. I revised them several times. I'm exhausted.</p>
