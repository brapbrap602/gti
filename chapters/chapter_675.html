<h1>Chapter 667: The Interview</h1><p>As expected!</p><p>The chief steward of the Qiongyu Trading Company was extremely powerful, possibly a Core Formation mid-stage or even late-stage cultivator.  It was unclear if such a trading company could command Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ran Luo chatted for a while longer, then he brought up the purpose of his visit.</p><p>Ran Luo pondered for a moment, then said, "For us human cultivators, mutual support in foreign lands is a given.  Several fellow Daoists have already agreed to travel together, so Fellow Daoist Qing Feng can rest assured. However, I have a few questions. I wonder if Fellow Daoist Qing Feng is willing to answer them?"</p><p>"Please speak," Qin Sang sat up straight.</p><p>Ran Luo nodded. "May I ask if this is Fellow Daoist's first time visiting the Storm Demon Sea? What are your plans after arriving there? Are you planning to hunt demons alone, or have you already contacted other fellow Daoists to form a team?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, his voice deepening. "These are private matters.  Do they concern your company?"</p><p>In front of strangers, he was unwilling to reveal his background.</p><p>Ran Luo waved her hand. "Fellow Daoist, please don't misunderstand. It's fine if you don't answer. I ask these questions because I'm afraid that if this is your first time in the Storm Demon Sea, you may not understand the dangers there.  Even cultivators with high cultivation levels like Fellow Daoist rarely travel alone. Most choose to join a faction or form a team with other Daoists for mutual protection. If Fellow Daoist hasn't contacted any other factions yet, you might consider our Qiongyu Trading Company."</p><p>Ran Luo looked at Qin Sang frankly, extending her invitation.</p><p>Qin Sang learned that every Core Formation cultivator who came to the Qiongyu Trading Company would receive such an invitation. He didn't rush to refuse, carefully considering the feasibility.</p><p>"Outer Sea Retainer?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>This title was the position Ran Luo had just offered him.</p><p>"Exactly," Ran Luo explained, seeing Qin Sang's confusion.  "Those of us who frequently travel to and from the Storm Demon Sea habitually call it the Outer Sea, and the Boundless Sea the Inner Sea. This distinction between inner and outer is not limited to the sea itself; many organizations are also divided in this way."</p><p>"The most common example is trading companies like ours. Unlike sects, we don't have the same rigid boundaries.  To maintain our influence in the Outer Sea, we recruit many highly skilled cultivators like Fellow Daoist as Outer Sea Retainers."</p><p>"Most of these Outer Sea Retainers are disciples of prominent sects in the Inner Sea, and this doesn't affect their involvement with the trading company."</p><p>"Matters of the Outer Sea are separate from the Inner Sea."</p><p>"After returning to the Inner Sea, if Fellow Daoist still wishes to be a retainer, we would be delighted. If not, we won't force you. In the Inner Sea, we will be as strangers, and this won't affect your original affiliations."</p><p>"Becoming an Outer Sea Retainer for our company also has countless benefits…"</p><p>Ran Luo explained eloquently, trying to allay Qin Sang's concerns and entice him with various benefits.</p><p>Some of them made Qin Sang's heart flutter.</p><p>He wasn't a cultivator from the Boundless Sea and wasn't bound by a sect. Joining the Qiongyu Trading Company didn't seem like a bad idea. However, Qin Sang knew clearly that these benefits weren't free.</p><p>"What responsibilities come with being a retainer for your company?"</p><p>Ran Luo chuckled softly. "If the trading company encounters a crisis, we will naturally need Fellow Daoist to work with us to overcome the difficulties.  Under normal circumstances, the company won't restrict Fellow Daoist too much. On the contrary, we will help Fellow Daoist connect with other Daoists to hunt demons together at sea…"</p><p>As expected.</p><p>There's no such thing as a free lunch.</p><p>A nicer term would be "retainer," but in reality, it was "enforcer."</p><p>The Storm Demon Sea was never stable, and crises could arise at any moment.</p><p>He was a lone wolf. If he encountered danger, he would naturally choose to flee. Becoming an Outer Sea Retainer would place an invisible shackle on him, restricting his freedom.</p><p>Taking the benefits and not fulfilling the duties was even less of an option. Deserting in the face of danger would likely result in being hunted by not only the Qiongyu Trading Company but also the entire Eastern Pole Alliance, making it impossible for him to move freely in either the Inner or Outer Sea.</p><p>However, having the backing of a powerful organization did offer many advantages.</p><p>Ran Luo was right; going it alone in the Storm Demon Sea was not feasible.</p><p>Qin Sang had long realized the hardships of being a rogue cultivator.</p><p>After pondering for a while, a thought suddenly struck Qin Sang. He asked, "Does your company only recruit this type of retainer? If there were fellow Daoists skilled in refining tools or alchemy, would they be eligible to join?"</p><p>The responsibilities of a tool refiner and an enforcer were different.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had intended to continue honing his tool refining skills. Joining a faction as a tool refiner seemed like a perfect fit.</p><p>Ran Luo's eyes lit up. "If there were fellow Daoists skilled in tool refining or alchemy, any trading company would eagerly welcome them. How could we refuse? Could it be that Fellow Daoist…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.  "I have some experience in the art of tool refining."</p><p>Ran Luo was overjoyed. "What magical treasures has Fellow Daoist refined?"</p><p>Why did this feel like a job interview?</p><p>Qin Sang grumbled inwardly, feeling slightly embarrassed.  "I have only refined my own natal magical treasure, which is still in development. However…"</p><p>Because natal magical treasures are coordinated with cultivation techniques, the refining process only requires following the guidance of the technique step by step, making it less difficult. Refining other magical treasures was a different story.</p><p>The spiritual materials required for magical treasures were extremely precious.</p><p>Qin Sang only had the oral teachings of a single tool refiner from the Hollow Spirit Sect, barely touching upon the true essence. He hadn't fully mastered it yet and didn't dare to rashly attempt refining other magical treasures.</p><p>He still had a complete Yin ring left for the Primordial Concentric Rings, which greatly reduced the difficulty of refining.</p><p>Once he completed the Primordial Concentric Rings, his proficiency in tool refining would surely advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Noticing the disappointment that flashed in Ran Luo's eyes, Qin Sang changed his tone and said confidently, "However, I am extremely proficient in refining magical instruments, especially top-grade magical instruments. With the same spiritual materials, in my hands, not only is the success rate higher than others, but the power of the refined instruments will also be stronger."</p><p>Qin Sang's confidence stemmed from the Nine Nether Demonic Flame.</p><p>He had verified its effectiveness when refining the Devouring Cone in the Blackwing Eagle's cave. The Nine Nether Demonic Flame greatly assisted in the refining process.</p><p>With his current cultivation level, aided by the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, he could significantly increase the success rate and power of magical instruments. Refining top-grade magical instruments was definitely within his grasp.</p><p>Top-grade magical instruments weren't as valuable as magical treasures, but they were definitely the most in-demand items in the cultivation world. The Qiongyu Trading Company didn't only cater to Core Formation cultivators, so Qin Sang didn't believe they wouldn't be interested.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's confident words, Ran Luo's interest was piqued.  "Some of the demon corpses acquired in the Outer Sea are not suitable for refining magical treasures or pills, so we often choose to refine them into magical instruments on-site. Our company eagerly seeks talented individuals. If Fellow Daoist truly possesses unique tool refining techniques and is willing to join, please feel free to state any conditions. We will surely satisfy Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang caught the implication, looked around, and said thoughtfully, "I still have some matters to attend to. Since we are traveling together to the Storm Demon Sea, why don't we wait until we arrive there, where there will be plenty of demon corpses? I can personally demonstrate my tool refining skills to you. Then, we can discuss the details further."</p><p>The Qiongyu Trading Company was evaluating him.</p><p>He also wanted to evaluate the Qiongyu Trading Company.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't fully understand the Storm Demon Sea yet and didn't want to commit so quickly. He would decide which faction to join after arriving at the Storm Demon Sea.</p>
