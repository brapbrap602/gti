<h1>Chapter 1922: Blood Moon</h1><p>Qin Sang produced a handful of dark pills as if by magic, handing them to Xiao Wu.  Three pills per pot of water would suffice.  After boiling, people lined up to receive the water, served by Xiao Wu and the others. One bowl per person was enough to restore them to full health.</p><p>These people were naturally grateful to Qin Sang and Xiao Wu, extending their thanks to the three young girls as well.  This was their first experience with such a scene. The heat had cleared much of the dust from their faces, leaving their cheeks rosy and prompting shy smiles.</p><p>“Little fairy sister, are you unhappy?”</p><p>The youngest girl, shorter than Xiao Wu and incapable of heavy work, assisted Xiao Wu, tilting her head up. She noticed Xiao Wu's consistently calm expression, lacking any smile, and asked, puzzled.</p><p>Xiao Wu served a bowl of the medicinal water to the person in front of her, tilting her head slightly.</p><p>“Thank you, little fairy! Thank you for saving us!  From now on, my whole family will worship you every day and offer our deepest gratitude…”</p><p>The person bowed repeatedly, their gratitude heartfelt, carefully holding the bowl as they retreated.</p><p>Xiao Wu pondered for a moment, then said, “It’s fine.”</p><p>The young girl was even more confused.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted her gaze from Xiao Wu to a nearby empty space. “Is it the land deity? Why not reveal yourself?”</p><p>A plume of white smoke rose from the ground, revealing a short, elderly man holding a land-surveyor’s staff.</p><p>“This land’s deity, greets the immortal,” the deity bowed in greeting.</p><p>“I am Qingfeng, I dare not accept the title of immortal,” Qin Sang shook her head slightly, glancing at the long line. Her tone suddenly changed, “I had assumed this land had no divine beings.”</p><p>The land deity showed an embarrassed expression, explaining repeatedly, “It is not that I, the humble deity, did not wish to fulfill my duty, but the world is in chaos, demons roam freely, and some even dare to hunt and devour gods, becoming increasingly rampant.  My divine power is weak, I dared not reveal myself. I could only destroy my temple, hide in the mountains and wilds, surviving with difficulty.  Seeing your righteous actions, I dared to show myself.”</p><p>“Are they demons from Mu Luo Mountain?” Qin Sang looked west.</p><p>The land deity nodded. “If it were only the local demons and cultivators, we could still suppress them.  However, in recent years, they have colluded with the demons of Mu Luo Mountain, infiltrating the land, destroying cities, and slaying gods. The city god unfortunately perished in battle, his statue shattered. The divine path collapsed, and the righteous cultivators within the land live in constant fear. Even the largest sect, Shou Long Mountain, was forced to relocate, and no one can restrain them anymore…”</p><p>The land deity sighed, “I’ve heard that the closer to Mu Luo Mountain, the worse it is. The demons use mortals as blood sacrifices. Some countries have been entirely consumed. In better situations, mortals are raised like livestock, fattened up, and forced to slaughter each other, their flesh used to build altars for the practice of blood-soul cultivation techniques. Those countries and righteous cultivators who have the ability to protect themselves can only stay out of the conflict and struggle to survive. I hear that the situation in the east is better; you came from the east, correct?”</p><p>Just then, a commotion broke out at the back of the line.</p><p>Several burly men rushed from the rear.</p><p>These men were ruffians, strong and imposing, standing out starkly amongst the weak townsfolk.</p><p>The leader had a fleshy face and eyes full of malice.  Others feared them, lowering their heads, afraid to meet his gaze lest they be targeted.</p><p>“Boss, there's a deity over there!”</p><p>A shirtless accomplice tugged at the leader, pointing forward, whispering.</p><p>Due to lack of space, the queue snaked around several corners. They reached the first bend, hiding behind the crowd, observing through the gaps.</p><p>The leader narrowed his eyes, “A real deity?”</p><p>“Absolutely, boss! Look at those who drank the medicine; they are all healthy and strong! It must be divine medicine! Immortal medicine! One sip grants longevity! Let's get in line quickly; it’ll be gone if we’re late!” The accomplice licked his lips, his eyes greedy.</p><p>“So many people, what’s the point of lining up?  There’s not enough medicine for everyone,”</p><p>The leader scoffed, then suddenly looked at the people lining up next to him, staring intensely without speaking.</p><p>He didn’t need to speak; his gaze was like that of a wolf.</p><p>The person he stared at trembled, their body shaking slightly as they shrunk back.</p><p>The thugs scanned the line one by one, creating a small space.</p><p>The line was already crowded; the forced space led an elderly person to lose their balance and fall.</p><p>The old man, agitated, trembled as he pointed at them, “You! You dare to act so brazenly before the deity…”</p><p>“Oops! Be careful, old man.”</p><p>The leader rushed forward, pressing down the old man’s arm, unceremoniously helping him up with a concerned look.</p><p>His gaze, however, was like a knife, as if saying, "Old man, I haven't forgotten you!"</p><p>Even across the crowd, it couldn't escape the eyes of Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>"Hey! Old Land Deity!"</p><p>Zhu Que leaped from Qin Sang's shoulder onto the Land Deity, startling him.  The Land Deity realized this fire raven was also a powerful being and quickly offered a conciliatory smile.</p><p>"What are the commands of this celestial being?"</p><p>Zhu Que craned its neck, staring at him. "You're the Land Deity here. Even if you dare not reveal yourself, you must know what these people have done."</p><p>"Anything within the Wu Du Mountain area, I know! I know it all!"</p><p>"I ask you, among these people, who have committed rape, robbery, or even eaten human flesh?"</p><p>As the saying goes, "What you do, heaven sees."  Every action of these people was seen and remembered by the Land Deity. Raising his earth staff, he pointed repeatedly, recounting each person's misdeeds with perfect recall.</p><p>Zhu Que listened, then spat out a ball of fire, which split into sparks that scattered.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Several large men, who had been chatting and laughing, suddenly fell backward, each with a tiny, almost invisible hole in their forehead.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded elsewhere, causing widespread commotion.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Zhu Que.</p><p>"You only said you and Xiao Wu wouldn't kill, I never said that! Giving these people elixirs is a waste, isn't it?" Zhu Que hummed a little tune learned from the mortal world, avoiding Qin Sang's gaze, and hopped onto Xiao Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "These people are going to Du Zhi Kingdom ahead. I observe that Du Zhi Kingdom has no disorder; its laws are strict and it shouldn't tolerate such evildoers."</p><p>The Land Deity bowed. "The Daoist is right. I also planned to report the actions of these people to my counterparts in Du Zhi Kingdom. However, this celestial being's actions are truly satisfying. The several immortals are all supremely righteous, a blessing to the people, a boon to us, a blessing to the world!"</p><p>"You don't need to flatter me. I'm not a saint who saves the world. I can only provide them with enough food to last a few days until they reach Du Zhi Kingdom and fend for themselves."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "You can save them for a moment, but not for a lifetime. You can protect one place, but not the entire world!"</p><p>He had said he would find a way to suppress Xiao Wu's demonic intent through healing.</p><p>But he was very clear about his goals.</p><p>And he understood that this world was like this, that he alone could not change it.</p><p>He had no unrealistic ideas; he would let things go as they may.</p><p>A look of disappointment flashed across the Land Deity's face. He had personally seen the Zongzhu of Shou Long Mountain and felt his bearing was far inferior to this Daoist. He had hoped that a truly virtuous person would descend to the mortal realm to turn the tide.</p><p>Pot after pot of medicinal liquid was distributed.</p><p>The sun set, and the heat subsided somewhat.</p><p>The last rays of twilight were obscured by the mountains, and dusk settled.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, who was still speaking with the Land Deity, sensed something unusual and suddenly looked up!</p><p>In the not-yet-completely-dark night sky, a faint moon shadow appeared.</p><p>The moon hung high in the sky, extremely far away and unreachable. The moonlight was weak, not even as bright as the surrounding stars.</p><p>Gradually, the moon underwent a strange change; a faint red glow appeared at the edge of its halo.</p><p>The red glow seemed to emerge from behind the moon, becoming very noticeable within a few breaths.  It wasn't a pure red, but a blood-red, forming another blood-red ring around the moon's halo.</p><p>The red glow continued to expand, larger than the halo and brighter than the moonlight, even staining the moon itself blood-red!</p><p>The scene was as if another blood moon had risen behind the moon, but its true form was hidden from view, obscured by the moon itself.</p><p>Two moons shone together!</p><p>No, it was three moons!</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly.  He discovered that with the appearance of the red glow, another slightly dimmer area of moonlight appeared under the moonlight. It was not as large as the main moon, but significantly bigger than the stars, like a smaller, dark moon.</p><p>The dark moon slowly revolved around the real moon, sometimes hidden in the blood-red glow behind the moon and sometimes appearing on the moon's surface, blending into the moonlight, easily missed by ordinary people.</p><p>Blood moon, moon, and dark moon—three moons shone together!</p><p>The Land Deity, seeing Qin Sang's reaction, also looked up into the sky.  Seeing the celestial change, his face showed astonishment.</p><p>The moonlight, stained blood-red, fell upon the earth, and even ordinary people noticed something was wrong.</p><p>"Oh my god! Look at the sky!"</p><p>"The moon has turned red!"</p><p>"A blood moon! It's the legendary blood moon!"</p><p>…</p><p>The red moonlight fell on the ground, staining the earth and mountains a faint crimson.</p><p>People felt as if they were in a sea of blood. Those who had witnessed the horrors of war were especially affected, their memories of bloodshed triggering feelings of terror and fear.</p><p>"This is an omen of war!"</p><p>"An ill omen... an ill omen... The moon is stained with blood; everyone will die, everyone will die…"</p><p>They had just been saved by immortals, escaping from suffering, yet now a blood moon appeared, turning the world crimson!</p><p>Fear spread, plunging them into deep panic.</p><p>Even the land spirit murmured, “A blood moon appears.  Will the world truly face devastation?”</p><p>Fire Domain Dojo.</p><p>Qin Sang, in his true form, emerged from his cave dwelling, gazing at the blood moon in the sky, much like his manifestation.</p><p>In his over three thousand three hundred years in the Great Thousand World, he had never before witnessed a blood moon, nor heard of such a strange occurrence.  Why now? Was it a natural phenomenon or something more?</p><p>“Has a blood moon appeared before?” Qin Sang asked the land spirit.</p><p>Hesitantly, the land spirit replied, “I’ve seen a mountain god's writings that mention a blood moon.  He collected and organized ancient texts which state that blood moons appear erratically, sometimes every few hundred years, sometimes every few thousand. Sometimes it lasts an hour, sometimes until dawn. There's no pattern, no known cause. It's considered an ominous sign…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  The land spirit’s talk of widespread chaos was baseless.  He was certain the blood moon wasn't illuminating only this area; it shone across countless miles.  At that moment, the entire Great Thousand World was likely bathed in its light.  Even if it were an ominous sign, it wouldn't foretell disaster only here.</p><p>Even the entire territory under Yun Du Tianzhi's rule was likely but a corner of the Great Thousand World.  Since such an event recurs every few hundred years, it might be a cyclical pattern.  Perhaps it’s a unique celestial event of the Great Thousand World or someone wielding immense power.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but remember the South Heavenly Gate hidden within the moon.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid!  The gods are with us! The gods will save us!”</p><p>“Gods, save us!”</p><p>After the initial panic, someone shouted.  The people, as if waking from a dream, knelt down and prayed for protection.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to watch the blood moon.  After the blood moon and dark moon appeared, there was no further change; the situation remained the same.  Seeing no further clues, he stopped watching and continued his questioning:  “Do you know of any sects or powers in the vicinity known for their mastery of thunder magic?”</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's deduction, the altar was nearby, though the search area was quite large, potentially spanning several kingdoms.</p><p>The land spirit pondered for a moment, then shook his head.  “I enjoy making friends, and before the great upheaval, I had a wide circle of acquaintances, so I know something about the prominent sects. At most, they may cultivate a spell or two involving thunder, but none truly rely on thunder magic as their foundation.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, thought for a while, and asked again, “Are there any reclusive masters?”</p><p>“There are certainly reclusive cultivators. Though, to a Daoist like yourself, perhaps they wouldn't be considered masters,” the land spirit subtly flattered him before revealing all the information he knew.</p><p>Qin Sang noted everything.  Searching for the altar by starting with sects and cultivators would be the fastest approach. If that failed, he would have to search inch by inch.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired about nearby demons and evil spirits. He unleashed his spiritual awareness, extending it beyond Wu Du Mountain.</p><p>In the distance, among the mountains, the cultivators and the demons who rampaged in the mortal world, all evil beings, could not hide.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>In the mountains, the wind and clouds changed.</p><p>Without warning, a violent wind swept through the mountains, raising a dust storm.</p><p>The mountain cultivators felt a sudden chill and unease.</p><p>The sudden gale, coupled with the blood moon in the sky, made this night extraordinarily eerie.</p><p>They shivered, wishing to return to their caves.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and grabbed forward.</p><p>All the demons locked onto by Qin Sang suddenly felt a powerful force binding them, rendering them immobile. Then, a tremendous force lifted them into the air.</p><p>Even the demons in their cave dwellings couldn't escape; their formations and barriers were useless.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The wind swept up one figure after another. These figures struggled fiercely, but to no avail.</p><p>By the roadside.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The land spirit stared blankly at the horizon, watching as demons flew out of the mountains, crashing heavily before him.</p><p>Most of these demons had higher cultivations than him—demons he wouldn't dare provoke—yet now they were as helpless as chicks, utterly miserable and defenseless.</p><p>In an instant, a large pile formed on the ground, a jumble of demons and evil cultivators who practiced demonic arts.  Each one was terrified beyond measure.</p><p>Ignoring their pleas, Qin Sang flicked out a wisp of spiritual light, piercing their foreheads and easily controlling their souls.  He then extracted a small fragment of each soul, sealing it in a jade pendant, which he gave to the land spirit.</p><p>“I perceive your dissatisfaction with the status quo, and your ambition.  With this jade pendant, you can control their life and death, whether to execute them according to their crimes, or use them to help you slay demons and eliminate evil, it's entirely up to you.”</p><p>“This…this…”</p><p>The land spirit clutched the jade pendant, his lips trembling. A land spirit of such standing was rendered speechless by the overwhelming emotion.</p>
