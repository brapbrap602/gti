<h1>Chapter 287: Rainbow Bridge</h1><p>Chapter 287: Rainbow Bridge</p><p>Even if one received a real favor, he would only have to bow respectfully or, at most, kowtow three times to thank the master of the cave府.</p><p>After all, the master of the cave府 was long dead and this so-called thank you gift was simply to make the mind relaxed. Why waste time at this moment on the繁瑣 and laborious prostration ceremony?</p><p>Yu Kong appeared serious and performed the ritual very strictly. Qin Sang and the others complained in their hearts but dared not comment and could only wait patiently.</p><p>After the last symbolic ritual, Yu Kong did not stand up but, instead, raised his head to look at the clay statue.</p><p>His gaze fell on the clay statue’s left hand and his eyes revealed a hint of irrepressible excitement and anticipation.</p><p>The clay statue’s left hand was not making any hand gestures. It was simply placed flat on its knee, palm facing up, thumb retracted while the four fingers were flat and straight, pointing out of the main hall.</p><p>The moment Yu Kong finished prostrating, a gleam of rainbow light suddenly erupted from the clay statue’s fingertips.</p><p>An unexpected change occurred. Who would have thought that there would be a secret hidden in such an ordinary looking clay statue?</p><p>The interior of the main hall was thrown into chaos. Everyone was shocked and their gazes shifted between the clay statue and Yu Kong. Their expressions were filled with disbelief.</p><p>After all, after the Qiuhong Market had been discovered, countless immortal cultivators had visited and checked it out from top to bottom. This legacy main hall had been turned upside down and the clay statue had definitely been inspected from top to bottom. It was completely an ordinary statue.</p><p>Among them were even Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Before Yu Kong, no one had discovered the secret of the clay statue!</p><p>The rainbow light was released and eventually formed a rainbow bridge that spanned half of the main hall.</p><p>The rainbow bridge had the shape of an arch bridge but only half of it. One end landed in front of Yu Kong while the other end was connected to the clay statue’s palm and disappeared into the void.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart jumped.</p><p>Was this rainbow bridge the ‘hidden path’ that led to the medicine garden?</p><p>If not for seeing it with his own eyes, who would have thought that the so-called hidden path would be hidden in such an obvious location and activated in such a strange way?</p><p>The rainbow light filled the main hall with colorful rainbows. It seemed that Yu Kong had anticipated this. The moment the rainbow light appeared, he waved his hand and a wave of spirit energy blocked the entrance, preventing the light from leaking out and being seen by the people outside.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Yu Kong laughed towards the sky, “That friend did not deceive me! In today’s world, morals have collapsed and immortal cultivators only know how to search for treasure but do not know gratitude. Otherwise, how could the secret of the clay statue only be discovered by Yu in this day and age?”</p><p>Seeing Yu Kong laughing, everyone came back to their senses, looked at each other, and Yue Ya Xian asked sweetly, “Senior Yu, why have we never heard of such a strange aspect of the clay statue? Could it be that Senior was the first to discover it? Is the treasure vault of the cave府 master connected to this rainbow bridge?”</p><p>Yu Kong stopped laughing and looked over with a faint smile, “Regardless of where it leads, do you fellow Daoists not want to enter?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone’s eyes flashed with a hint of excitement. Wu Chen said carefully, “There is a secret ahead, and I would definitely like to enter. However, this rainbow bridge was first discovered by Fellow Daoist Yu. We must have Fellow Daoist’s consent before entering. I do not know what Fellow Daoist Yu’s requirements are. As long as you say it, we will definitely listen to Fellow Daoist Yu.”</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Although the purpose of this hidden rainbow bridge was unknown, it was definitely a significant existence and it was very possible that no one had ever set foot there before. There might even be more valuable treasures than those in the Spirit Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Even if they could only get a fraction of it, it would still be exciting.</p><p>As long as Yu Kong did not want to take everything for himself, everyone was willing to accept any requirements.</p><p>Yu Kong laughed softly, “Since Yu has invited Fellow Daoists here, I will not abandon you and take everything for myself. I do not know what is on the other side of the rainbow bridge or if there are any treasures. There could even be restrictions that are more dangerous than the Spirit Treasure Pavilion… Does anyone want to withdraw?”</p><p>At this moment, who could resist the temptation?</p><p>Moreover, they had already seen the secret. What would happen to them if they withdrew now?</p><p>No one withdrew. Yu Kong nodded with satisfaction and glanced outside the main hall, urging everyone, “Let’s go in now. We can’t stay here for too long.”</p><p>Yan Wu led the way and everyone lined up to walk onto the rainbow bridge. Yu Kong walked at the back.</p><p>Qin Sang followed quietly.</p><p>He did not immediately crush the Soul Synchronizing Jade. Although he was fairly certain that the rainbow bridge was the hidden path, it was better to not rashly send a message before he had a clear understanding of the situation on the other side of the rainbow bridge. Otherwise, he might end up being counterproductive.</p><p>He could see some clues from the jade. It seemed that the spirit medicines would not be so easy to collect. There was no need to rush.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang could not figure out Yu Kong’s intentions.</p><p>If he genuinely wanted to join forces with them to search for treasures and for everyone to have a happy safe journey, that would be fine.</p><p>If it was really like how Sheng Yuanzi had mocked and Yu Kong was just trying to find some scapegoats, then Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan were definitely necessary pawns for him. After all, he had already killed Shao Chunhui, so would Yu Kong care about killing more people?</p><p>Thinking of all this, Qin Sang watched the people ahead of him disappear at the end of the rainbow bridge one by one. It was finally his turn.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, secretly on guard, and stepped out at the break in the Rainbow Bridge, then there was a moment of darkness before his eyes, and he was not stepping on the void, but on the ground.</p><p>Everyone appeared in a cave, the outside of the cave entrance was dimly lit and misty. There was no danger in the cave, there were no restrictions, and everyone's expressions relaxed slightly as they turned to look at Yu Kong, who was the last to come in.</p><p>Yu Kong reached out and stroked the stone wall, and the Rainbow Bridge disappeared.</p><p>"The treasure is just ahead, what are you waiting for?"</p><p>Yu Kong said, and took the lead out of the cave.</p><p>Walking out of the cave, Qin Sang saw with his own eyes the scene shown in the jade pendant, and finally confirmed that this was where the Herb Garden was!</p><p>However, this place was far more vast than Qin Sang had imagined!</p><p>Outside the cave was a vast plain, with a few low peaks scattered across it, nothing special, except for the tallest mountain on the plain, which was exactly the peak shown in the jade pendant.</p><p>Fog locked the distant mountains, the aura of spirit herbs pierced the fog, attracting everyone's attention.</p><p>"Those...could they be spirit herbs planted by the cave master?"</p><p>Wu Chen exclaimed in a 失声, his eyes blazing with excitement. As for the others, they were all about the same as Wu Chen.</p><p>However, some people were still able to remain calm, and Elder Mu Teng said coldly: "Don't be in such a hurry to be happy, in my opinion, the miasma on that mountain is probably not ordinary miasma, but an unusually powerful restriction. Whether or not you can pick the spirit herbs is still uncertain."</p><p>Elder Mu Teng's words threw cold water on everyone, waking them up from their frenzy.</p><p>Yu Kong nodded slightly, looking at Elder Mu Teng and saying, with an inexplicable meaning in his tone, "Fellow Daoist Mu Teng is indeed a sly old fox, no wonder Sheng Yuanzi trusts you to come here and lurk by Yu's side."</p><p>Everyone was shocked when they heard this, and they all distanced themselves from Elder Mu Teng.</p><p>Elder Mu Teng's face changed dramatically, he forced himself to remain calm, and argued: "Since I set foot on the path of immortality, I have been alone, I don't know any Sheng Yuanzi, I don't know what Fellow Daoist Yu is talking about..."</p>
