<h1>Chapter 1661: Blood-Stained Kasaya</h1><p>The light from the exploding Sword Star expanded.</p><p>The surrounding Yuan Magnetic Force, as if enraged by the disruption, surged violently.</p><p>Tainted by the Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic Force, the starlight became dim and heavy, less dazzling, yet far more dangerous.</p><p>Mo Xingdao lingered at the periphery for a moment, glancing in the direction where Su Zinan had vanished. After a brief hesitation, he chose to give up.</p><p>The Poison King forced his way in. Though the poison clouds could withstand the Yuan Magnetic Force, he couldn't match Master Huaiyin's ease and gradually fell behind.</p><p>Qin Sang, Master Huaiyin, and Su Zinan formed the first echelon. The three figures split into three directions, pushing deeper into the starlight.</p><p>By now, Kundao had already left the central Hidden Star, appearing at the edge of the Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic Force.</p><p>Just now, the trajectories of the Sword Star and the Star Pavilion, even the timing of their collision with the Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic Force and the subsequent explosion, were all orchestrated by her from behind the scenes. Everything appeared natural, arousing no suspicion from her prey.</p><p>Her only worry was that the treasures within the Star Pavilion weren't plentiful enough. Now, it seemed the effect was surprisingly good. All three parties were lured by the treasures, drawn into the Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic Force.</p><p>A fierce battle was inevitable. It all depended on whether she could seize the opportunity.</p><p>A faint, murderous smile played on Kundao's lips. Her figure merged with the divine light of the Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic Force, vanishing in a flash.</p><p>Qin Sang knew someone had entered before him, moving faster. With the罡Fire Shield protecting him, he flapped the Phoenix Wings, charging through the chaotic Yuan Magnetic Force.</p><p>The Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic Force, combined with the residual waves of the Sword Star explosion, created an extremely chaotic environment, distorting sight and perception. For a time, Qin Sang lost his target.</p><p>However, he reasoned, the Star Pavilion fragments shouldn't stray far from the center of the starlight in the short term.</p><p>With lightning speed, Qin Sang maintained a calm demeanor, contemplating how to handle the upcoming situation.</p><p>Just then, the Fire Jade Centipede in his sleeve stirred again, awakened by another sensation, wriggling its body.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense the Fire Jade Centipede's excitement, and… confusion.</p><p>A familiar scene unfolded – the third time!</p><p>Over the years, as Qin Sang's understanding of the Fire Jade Centipede deepened, he had more or less grasped its patterns. What triggered the centipede's instinctive reactions were mostly naturally formed treasures.</p><p>For instance, spiritual herbs beneficial to spirit insects, such as Redfire Gilded Gold and Myriad Spirit Fruit, special fire-attribute spiritual materials, or fire-attribute mineral veins.</p><p>And with the Fire Jade Centipede's cultivation increasing, its standards had also become more discerning. Taking it to a Fire Essence Stone mine now would likely be met with disdain.</p><p>Therefore, anything that could trigger its instinctive reaction wouldn't be of low value.</p><p>However, if it was an exceptionally unique refined treasure possessing a distinct aura, the Fire Jade Centipede would also be interested. The Fire Spirits refined by the people of the Fire Phase Hall fell under this category.</p><p>Since entering the Five Elements Restriction, the Fire Jade Centipede had reacted three times – at the outer restriction, the sword formation, and now within the Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic Force.</p><p>If it was an unclaimed, naturally formed treasure, how could it repeatedly appear and disappear in such places?</p><p>Moreover, the three instances were strikingly similar. The target seemed to be moving at high speed, making it impossible for the Fire Jade Centipede to lock onto it, leaving it disoriented instead.</p><p>"What is it exactly?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, his vigilance intensifying.</p><p>He didn't have much time to think. In the blink of an eye, he had already reached the depths of the starlight, where the Yuan Magnetic Force was far stronger than outside.</p><p>While the Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic Force outside was mostly in a misty form, with only a small amount condensed into Profound Yellow and Ash-Black divine light, here, the divine light was ubiquitous.</p><p>The divine light intertwined and collided, forming a dazzling world, as brilliant as the aurora.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly finally caught sight of the Sword Star again.</p><p>Or rather, the fragments of the Sword Star.</p><p>Drawn by the Yuan Magnetic Force, the fragments of the Sword Star and the Star Pavilion hadn't dispersed but clustered together. However, due to the chaotic magnetic force caused by the intertwining Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic divine light, they were divided into clusters, scattered throughout the vast space.</p><p>And as the Nine Nether Yuan Magnetic divine light shifted, these fragments constantly changed, either merging with each other or being torn apart by the magnetic force, captured by other clusters.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly scanned, locking onto one particular cluster.</p><p>Fortunately, the treasures that flew out of the Star Pavilion hadn't been scattered by the Sword Star explosion. Most of them remained clustered, including the Xin Metal Origin Crystal.</p><p>However, while spotting these treasures, Qin Sang also noticed an uninvited guest.</p><p>A monk with a golden dragon coiling around him, radiating an imposing aura, was actually a step ahead of him!</p><p>"Master Huaiyin!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>He had previously noticed the monk's vigorous Qi and blood. It now proved that he was a rare body cultivator, and his attainments were far superior to his own. The golden dragon was formed from blood Qi. As it coiled around him, the nearby magnetic light distorted.</p><p>Resisting the Yuan Magnetic divine light purely with his physical strength!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>With a single stride, Master Huaiyin's golden dragon roared, seemingly unaffected by the layers of magnetic light, instantly advancing hundreds of zhang.</p><p>In his wake, the magnetic light warped like sharp swords. Some were dispersed by the golden dragon, while others pierced Master Huaiyin's body. Yet, golden light flowed across his skin as if he wore golden armor.</p><p>The magnetic light bounced off his skin upon contact, unable to hinder him in the slightest.</p><p>Witnessing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel at the monk's unmatched power.</p><p>Despite his admiration, Qin Sang couldn't let Master Huaiyin take the treasures. However, the Goldfall Sword was useless within the magnetic light, and he had to be cautious with the Sun God Bird.  He silently formed hand seals, preparing to summon heavenly thunder and unleash True Words.</p><p>At that moment, an unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>The explosion of the Sword Star hadn't truly ceased. Amidst the rumbling, a visible residual wave spread to the cluster of fragments containing the treasures, causing the surrounding magnetic light to fluctuate.</p><p>Just as Master Huaiyin was about to succeed, a thick beam of magnetic light shone from afar, instantly pulling the cluster of fragments away with immense Yuan Magnetic Force.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's reaction was incredibly swift, but the obstruction caused him to miss the perfect opportunity to seize the treasures.</p><p>Above his head, a blood cloud had gathered unnoticed.</p><p>The blood cloud, devoid of any putrid scent, was exceptionally pure.</p><p>Within the blood cloud, a jade disc floated – a talisman disc. The disc flipped, facing Master Huaiyin.  At its center, blood-red light intensified, strange runes flashed consecutively, and several blood-colored chains shot out.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The blood-colored chains targeted Master Huaiyin's limbs and neck, attempting to bind him.</p><p>Master Huaiyin snorted, his voice like a thunderclap.  His back straightened abruptly, the golden dragon snarled ferociously, and he threw a powerful punch skyward with his right arm, muscles bulging.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The blood-colored chains shattered, the blood cloud recoiled, and the talisman disc trembled, nearly breaking.</p><p>The might of a single punch, terrifying indeed!</p><p>"Master, hold your horses. Why don't we…"</p><p>Su Zinan's figure flickered within the depths of the magnetic light, his voice echoing as he used a secret technique.</p><p>He enjoyed watching grand cultivators fight to the death, but he preferred to instigate conflict and wait for the right moment to act, unwilling to put himself at risk. Moreover, Master Huaiyin was a body cultivator, not his target.</p><p>However, before he could finish, Master Huaiyin's ears twitched slightly. He abruptly turned his head, just in time to see a cluster of black fire emerge from the magnetic light, flying straight towards the cluster of fragments.</p><p>It was Qin Sang who had charged out.</p><p>He had initially intended to personally stop Master Huaiyin. Since someone else had taken on the task, he immediately changed his mind.  The magnetic light was pulling the cluster of fragments towards him; how could he not seize the opportunity?</p><p>However, as he acted, Qin Sang was filled with extreme vigilance and had his own considerations.</p><p>He recognized that blood path talisman disc, instantly identifying it as Su Zinan's handiwork.</p><p>Judging from Su Zinan's tone, they seemed to have communicated prior. Qin Sang couldn't give Su Zinan and Master Huaiyin time to negotiate, or he'd be at a disadvantage.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's greatest concern was the mysterious enemy lurking in the shadows.</p><p>Master Huaiyin was about to succeed when the magnetic light suddenly changed direction, pulling the treasures towards him. This didn't feel like luck to Qin Sang, but rather too coincidental!</p><p>In a split second, without time for careful deliberation, Qin Sang acted. It would be best if he could directly snatch the treasures. Otherwise, it would confirm his suspicions.</p><p>"It's you?"</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>Su Zinan and Master Huaiyin's shouts rang out simultaneously.</p><p>Enveloped by the罡Fire Shield, Qin Sang's face was concealed from Su Zinan, but he recognized the Demonic Fire.</p><p>Upon their reunion, Su Zinan didn't hesitate.  He drew runes in the air, merging them into the talisman disc with a flash.  The disc trembled slightly, reversing, its center targeting Qin Sang's trajectory.</p><p>Above Qin Sang, a blood-red character 'Death' appeared!</p><p>The talisman disc became translucent, but the 'Death' character grew increasingly radiant, exuding a terrifying aura of death, imprinting itself towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Facing Qin Sang, Su Zinan showed no mercy.</p><p>He had already revealed his killing intent towards Qin Sang. Reconciliation was impossible.  He would seize any opportunity to eliminate the threat.</p><p>At the same time, he yelled, "Master, don't just stand there! Take him down!"</p><p>Master Huaiyin had no prior dealings with Su Zinan, but he had learned about Su Zinan's deeds from the Poison King and held no favorable impression of him. He wouldn't heed his words.</p><p>However, even without Su Zinan's instigation, Master Huaiyin wouldn't allow the Xin Metal Origin Crystal to fall into another's hands.  He stomped heavily, his body like a small mountain, causing the void to tremble. As he charged, he clenched his fists, aiming a straight punch at Qin Sang.</p><p>The fist wind stirred, and the golden dragon roared.</p><p>Blood Qi surged, converging between his fists, completely merging into the fist imprint.</p><p>In the next moment, a golden dragon condensed from fist intent shot out, carrying a devastating force that seemed capable of destroying everything. Even through the罡Fire Shield, Qin Sang could sense the terrifying, explosive power, his heart secretly trembling.</p><p>The 'Death' seal above, the dragon fist approaching.</p><p>Even under the protection of the罡Fire Shield, Qin Sang couldn't help but tense up.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Su Zinan and Master Huaiyin's thoughts were also turbulent, startled by the power of the罡Fire Shield.</p><p>Although the 'Death' seal and dragon fist hadn't yet hit Qin Sang, their fluctuations had arrived.  The two forces clashed, yet the罡Fire Shield merely deformed slightly.  One must consider the omnipresent magnetic light surrounding them.</p><p>With such a treasure for protection, no wonder he dared to snatch the treasures from the fire.</p><p>Su Zinan's gaze darkened. Although Qin Sang's Demonic Fire and Sun God Fire were powerful offensive techniques, their excessive strength made them brittle.  Su Zinan believed that with careful planning, he had a chance to succeed.</p><p>Only now did he discover that the Demonic Fire could also transform into a defensive technique, seamlessly integrating offense and defense, with boundless versatility and becoming exceedingly difficult to deal with.</p><p>Su Zinan regretted choosing Qin Sang for the Demonic Banner. Unfortunately, he had already made a mortal enemy.</p><p>His eyes flickered, his thoughts unknown.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's thoughts were much simpler.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang became the target of two grand cultivators, locked onto by two powerful attacks.</p><p>However, what made Qin Sang suddenly wary wasn't these, but the Fire Jade Centipede's reaction, which had also become intense. The mysterious expert in the shadows was closing in on him!</p><p>"Did this person plan this all along, or was it a coincidence, or perhaps…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he made a swift decision.</p><p>The cluster of fragments was right in front of him, yet Qin Sang abruptly stopped, his figure halting before retreating.</p><p>His advance and retreat were incredibly decisive.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang so easily forced back, both Su Zinan and Master Huaiyin were taken aback.</p><p>Equally surprised was Kundao, hidden in the shadows. Merged with a beam of magnetic light, she witnessed Qin Sang's retreat, cursing him a coward. She had almost made her move.</p><p>Since Qin Sang had retreated, Kundao had to change her target, setting her sights on Master Huaiyin once more.</p><p>At this moment, regardless of Qin Sang's reasoning, Master Huaiyin moved like lightning. It seemed he was also lucky, as the cluster of fragments was once again drawn towards him by the shifting magnetic light.</p><p>With Qin Sang's retreat, the path was clear. Master Huaiyin didn't pursue Qin Sang relentlessly, the golden dragon fist intent passing him by.</p><p>Looking again, Master Huaiyin was already very close to the cluster of fragments.</p><p>With a slight change in expression, Qin Sang quickly formed a hand seal.</p><p>A bolt of lightning struck out of the blue.</p><p>The Profound Yellow and Ash-Black intertwined magnetic light created a dim backdrop. A flash of lightning dispelled the darkness as the Command Thunder Technique activated.</p><p>Although this technique wasn't as powerful as the sword formation or the Demonic Fire, it wasn't weak either. Master Huaiyin, relying solely on his physical body for defense, would surely be wary.  However, Qin Sang felt it wasn't strong enough. Thus, while executing the Command Thunder Technique, he used his Yuan Spirit to activate the Thousand Knot Divine Net, launching the Soul-Seizing True Word simultaneously.</p><p>"Hmph! Ha!"</p><p>Two Soul-Seizing True Words resonated along with the thunder, echoing within Master Huaiyin's mind.</p><p>Meanwhile, Su Zinan, well aware of Qin Sang's trickiness, dismissed his distractions and refocused on the treasures. Unwilling to let Master Huaiyin succeed, he also attacked.</p><p>He had reached a transcendent level in the blood path.</p><p>The fusion of the two demonic shadows wasn't merely to help him resist the magnetic light. It also enhanced his techniques, greatly increasing his control. With a thought, the 'Death' seal that was about to miss was forcefully pulled back, its direction shifting abruptly towards Master Huaiyin.</p><p>In an instant, the roles reversed, and Master Huaiyin became the target of their combined assault.</p><p>Faced with the siege, Master Huaiyin remained unfazed. He stretched out his palm, a golden vortex of blood Qi forming in his palm, its suction force locking onto the cluster of fragments.</p><p>Simultaneously, the blood Qi golden dragon reappeared around him. Within the intense golden light, accompanying the dragon's roar was a faint chanting sound.</p><p>Buddhist light converged behind Master Huaiyin, manifesting a Luohan phantom.</p><p>The Luohan's appearance was identical to Master Huaiyin's. As the phantom materialized, the golden dragon plunged into it, merging as one. The seemingly tangible Buddhist light completely enveloped Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin transformed into a golden Luohan, making the 'Death' seal and heavenly thunder appear insignificant.</p><p>In the next moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The surrounding magnetic light stirred. Drawn by an unknown force, endless magnetic light surged frantically towards Master Huaiyin.</p><p>In an instant, all the magnetic light converged into a massive pillar, engulfing Master Huaiyin with terrifying Yuan Magnetic Force. The golden Luohan phantom shook violently. As the heavenly thunder and 'Death' seal descended, countless cracks appeared on its surface.</p><p>A furious roar, like a clap of thunder, erupted from within the magnetic light.</p><p>Within the magnetic light.</p><p>Master Huaiyin resembled a wrathful Vajra. A slender, jade-like hand pierced through his chest from behind, staining his kasaya with blood.</p>
