<h1>**Chapter 236: Rescue**</h1><p>Both evil weapons were marvelous and had incredible power, but Qin Sang didn’t hesitate for long before deciding to have the Ghost Banner devour them.</p><p>Two more evil weapons would merely be a bonus to Qin Sang, but improving the Ten Directions Ghost Banner was of utmost importance. The perfected Ten Directions Ghost Formation could be a treasure that would allow him to challenge opponents of higher levels.</p><p>After making up his mind, Qin Sang directly set up the Ten Directions Ghost Formation on the stone disk, endured the Firebird’s harassment, and had his Ghost Banner devour the souls. It didn’t take long for the souls of the two evil weapons to be completely devoured, but the Ten Directions Ghost Banner still needed some time.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his palm over and threw the soul refining evil weapon he had bought from the black market into the formation.</p><p>Finally, the six Ten Directions Ghost Banners were all complete!</p><p>The Ghost Banner moved, and soul threads formed a net, as ten thousand ghosts cried together.</p><p>The stone disk was suddenly filled with a gloomy atmosphere, as if it were hell.</p><p>Meanwhile, he seemed like a human world Ghost King who was pasturing ghosts!</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Ten Directions Ghost Formation, took a group of Firebirds, made a small attempt, nodded with satisfaction, then took his Ten Directions Ghost Banners with a wave of his hand. His figure flickered and he left the bewildered Firebirds, who had lost their target, and flew towards the end of the iron chain.</p><p>His journey was unobstructed.</p><p>When he was about to reach the end of the iron chain, Qin Sang noticed that many iron chains were converging on one point. At this time, he suddenly heard an incredibly urgent and loud cry in front of him. The fog rolled and the disorder rose. Vaguely, one could see a ball of “red cloud” blocking the path ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang was all too familiar with this situation.</p><p>Someone had been trapped by Firebirds?</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed. He collected his breath and approached the red cloud quietly.</p><p>When he got close, he saw that among the Firebirds, there were countless colorful raindrops falling from the red cloud. This scene seemed unusually beautiful.</p><p>The raindrops appeared harmless to humans and animals, but they actually concealed killing intent. When the Firebirds were pierced by a few raindrops, their bodies extinguished like real flames and they ultimately disappeared from the world.</p><p>However, the Firebirds were endless. The more that were killed, the more were attracted.</p><p>No matter how dense the raindrops were, they could not kill all the Firebirds. On the contrary, more and more Firebirds gathered around. Just when Qin Sang approached, the red cloud expanded and thickened at a speed visible to the naked eye, until finally the raindrops could not penetrate the red cloud at all and were extinguished!</p><p>These raindrops looked very familiar…</p><p>“Five-colored glass? Is it her?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised. The person trapped by the Firebirds was actually Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong.</p><p>At this time, the raindrops in the red cloud were becoming thinner and thinner, and the spiritual energy was dissipating. It seemed like Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong’s situation was not very good.</p><p>After thinking about it, Qin Sang quietly retreated a short distance, summoned the Ebonywood Sword, and decided to rescue her.</p><p>On the one hand, it was in preparation for the upcoming trials.</p><p>The reason he could be so relaxed now was because the Jade Buddha was the nemesis of the Firebirds. The difficulty of the trials was unquestionable. Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong was of medium to high strength among those who had entered the ancient cultivator’s residence, and she was now also in danger.</p><p>In the upcoming trials, he would not be able to rely on the Jade Buddha to cheat. If he could join forces with Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong, their chances of passing would be greater. Even if they encountered danger, they could help each other out and retreat without having to be trapped like Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong and forced to wait for death in despair.</p><p>On the other hand, they had worked together before in the mine, and Qin Sang’s impression of Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong was quite good. Her relationship with Yin Xingge was not very close, and she had strongly advocated not abandoning him, which showed that she had a good nature.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated out of Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong’s sight, released his breath, attracted a group of Firebirds, and then rushed forward with these burdens in tow.</p><p>When he saw the “red cloud,” Qin Sang paused for a moment and pretended to be surprised. He shouted, “Is that Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong inside?”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin?”</p><p>The red cloud was followed by an abnormally weak but infinitely surprised voice. Its tone was extremely urgent. “Fellow Daoist Qin, I am Yun Qiong. Please save me, Fellow Daoist Qin…”</p><p>“Be careful Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong!”</p><p>Qin Sang had come to save her. Upon hearing these words, he unhesitatingly unfolded his sword array and gave a loud reminder, then the Ebonywood Sword released an incomparably powerful sword energy, pointing directly at the red cloud. The might of the sword array fully erupted, and the sword energy instantly surged dozens of feet. A flaming red sword light directly pierced through the middle of the red cloud, opening a channel for escape.</p><p>A moment later, the passage in the red cloud stirred, and just when it seemed about to close, a slender figure suddenly flashed out of the passage. It was Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong.</p><p>At this time, Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong looked extremely disheveled. The robe she was wearing was full of holes, and it could only barely provide a little bit of defensive power. Her breath was extremely weak, and her spiritual energy was on the verge of exhaustion.</p><p>Above her head, the multicolor glass floated with diffused and dim light, looking like it would lose its support at any moment.</p><p>Yun Qiong’s face was as pale as paper, a sign of her primordial spirit having been severely injured.</p><p>However, it was not only her primordial spirit injury that weakened her. There was a chilling knife wound on her abdomen that nearly cut her in half. The remaining golden light on the wound prevented it from healing. Fresh blood still seeped out of the wound.</p><p>Qin Sang could guess what happened to Yun Qiong from her condition. The Firebird would not use a blade. The knife wound must have been inflicted in the passage.</p><p>Yun Qiong must have encountered danger in the passage, and after much difficulty, she killed her way out. Before she could heal her wounds, she was alerted to the Firebird. She could only flee with her injuries.</p><p>For cultivators, this kind of injury was not fatal. As long as she expelled the remaining golden light on her wound and consumed a few healing elixirs, she would be fine.</p><p>Yun Qiong must not have expected the Firebird to be so powerful. Her physical wounds had not healed yet when she was hit by a heavy blow to her primordial spirit. To top it off, she had been able to hold on until now because of her profound cultivation level.</p><p>“Thank you, Fellow Daoist Qin…”</p><p>Before she could finish speaking, Yun Qiong saw the red clouds chasing closely behind her, and countless Firebirds surged forward with menacing momentum. A thick wave of fear flitted across her eyes.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong, come with me!”</p><p>Qin Sang did not want to reveal the jade Buddha’s abilities in front of Yun Qiong. He immediately created a protective barrier around Yun Qiong with his spiritual energy. He then cleared the path with his Ebony Sword and darted forward quickly. Yun Qiong hurriedly urged the remaining spiritual energy in her body to keep up with Qin Sang with difficulty.</p><p>Finally, a stone disk appeared before the iron chains.</p><p>The two accelerated and landed on the stone disk. The relentless Firebirds were blocked by an invisible barrier that also masked their perceptions. The Firebirds circled the stone disk for a while, but when they could not find their targets, they dispersed.</p><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>Yun Qiong covered her knife wound and swayed on her feet. Despite her condition, she still insisted on making a salute to Qin Sang. “Thank you, Fellow Daoist Qin, for saving my life. I am eternally grateful!”</p><p>“Let’s put the pleasantries aside and heal your wounds first, Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong!”</p><p>Qin Sang saw that Yun Qiong looked distressed. He knew that she must have used up all her healing elixirs. He took out a jade bottle and handed it to her.</p><p>As Yun Qiong sat down cross-legged to rest and heal her injuries, Qin Sang surveyed their surroundings.</p><p>As soon as they landed on the stone disk…</p><p>Inside the ancient ruins…</p><p>A black stone stele rose up to the clouds. A figure emerged from it.</p>
