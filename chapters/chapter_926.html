<h1>Chapter 918: Night Shadow Insects</h1><p>Three days later.</p><p>Two streaks of light flew out from Poison Island. After a swift flight, they landed on a deserted island in the distance. It was Bai Zhongqiu and his wife.</p><p>They looked back towards Poison Island, their eyes filled with reluctance and worry.</p><p>“Husband, Ying’er she…”</p><p>Bai Hong couldn't help but shed tears, thinking about her daughter possibly being offered as a sacrifice to a demonic cultivator.</p><p>“Don't worry, my dear. The cultivation technique the senior gave Ying’er is a proper orthodox Water-elemental technique, perfectly suitable for her. It's not some demonic cauldron technique. Although the senior acts ruthlessly, he doesn't seem like a villain who harms the innocent. Otherwise, having occupied Poison Island for so long, he wouldn't have remained without any notoriety.  The nearby cultivators don't even know of his existence. He’s likely a solitary cultivator. Ying’er might even benefit from this misfortune…”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu could only comfort his wife and himself with these words. He finally sighed, "It's a pity the senior flatly refused to take Ying’er as a disciple."</p><p>“Your judgment is always very accurate, husband. Since you say he’s a solitary cultivator, how could he easily take on a disciple? That cultivation technique is probably just compensation for us. As for the Fiend-Slaying Pill the senior promised, I wouldn't dare to hope for it."</p><p>Bai Hong wiped away her tears and whispered.</p><p>Qin Sang, having cultivated for many years and faced numerous enemies, had acquired many cultivation techniques, mostly of the five elements. Any one of them would be far superior to what Bai Zhongqiu and his wife had gathered for their daughter.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu nodded and took out some items. “Even without the Fiend-Slaying Pill, the senior hasn't mistreated us. Not only did he help us refine our flying shuttle, but he also gave us these Devouring Awls. As long as we don't provoke enemies above mid-Core Formation, we should have some means of self-preservation.”</p><p>In Bai Zhongqiu's palm were a dozen Devouring Awls, the same ones he had crafted for his clone.</p><p>Besides these, there was also a flying shuttle, their original magical tool.</p><p>This shuttle was originally only average among top-grade magical tools.</p><p>Qin Sang took the shuttle and spent two days refining it, applying the refining techniques he had comprehended from the Profound Iron Pillar and incorporating some spiritual materials.</p><p>After being refined, the shuttle, under the combined control of the couple, could achieve a speed comparable to an ordinary early Core Formation cultivator. If Bai Zhongqiu and his wife weren't just Foundation Establishment cultivators, upgrading the shuttle to a magical treasure wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Bai Hong also nodded slightly. “I didn't expect the senior to be skilled in refining as well. With this treasure, we’ll be much safer. After all, the Gale Archipelago is not a peaceful place.  And the senior didn't ask us to risk our lives, only to gather useful spiritual materials and information, which greatly reduces the danger…”</p><p>“Indeed,” Bai Zhongqiu nodded, dividing half of the Devouring Awls with Bai Hong. “Spiritual materials are easy enough, we can buy them from various trading houses and shops. But the senior actually asked us to inquire about where they might auction jade pendants for entry into the Seven Slaughter Palace. Legend has it that the Seven Slaughter Palace is extremely dangerous, with countless powerful cultivators perishing within. Could the senior be going there as well?”</p><p>Clearly, Bai Zhongqiu had also heard of the Seven Slaughter Palace's formidable reputation.</p><p>To enter the Seven Slaughter Palace, one must have a jade pendant that can withstand the immortal formations.</p><p>Having had the previous experience, Qin Sang didn't want to mingle with the East Pole Alliance again.</p><p>He had heard that there were many powerful and mysterious cultivators in the Gale Archipelago. Before the Seven Slaughter Palace opened last time, jade pendants were auctioned off.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know when such an auction would take place again, so he asked them to keep an eye out and report back promptly.</p><p>“Also, the senior asked us to find out about the demonic cultivators in the Gale Archipelago who are most skilled in corpse refining techniques. This…”</p><p>Bai Hong frowned deeply.</p><p>Most of their worries stemmed from this.</p><p>“Forget it, it’s useless to overthink.  Let's not try to guess the senior’s intentions. He asked us to report back every so often, which allows us to see Ying’er. As long as Ying’er is safe and sound, whatever his purpose is, it has nothing to do with us. We’ll just do our best.”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu took his wife's hand and activated their flying shuttle, disappearing into the vast sea in no time.</p><p>On Poison Island.</p><p>Bai Ying’er watched her parents leave and returned to the cave anxiously. Seeing that no one paid any attention to her, she gradually became less afraid. Recalling the days when she followed her parents, wandering and living in fear, she even felt that it wasn't bad to be able to cultivate peacefully without disturbance.</p><p>Poison Island was far from being a picturesque paradise. It was a venomous and desolate land filled with hideous monsters, emanating a foul odor. She could only move around within the cave and a large valley in front of it.</p><p>Bai Ying’er didn’t dare disturb Qin Sang, but she often saw the Two-Headed Viper.</p><p>At first, she was afraid of the Two-Headed Viper, but later discovered it wouldn’t attack her and was much more intelligent than other monsters she had seen. She tentatively began to interact with it.</p><p>The Two-Headed Viper seemed exhausted, having regained its freedom.</p><p>But the more anxious it was, the less it could figure things out, roaring at the sun and moon every day.</p><p>Only now did it realize how rare opportunities were.</p><p>It was incredibly frustrated by this, and initially didn't want to pay any attention to the girl. Later, perhaps out of boredom, it gradually became familiar with her. After all, the girl would stroke its scales, while that guy only used it as a shield.</p><p>But that's a story for later.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation inside the cave, sorting through the spoils from eradicating the Demonic Sacrifice Cave. Then, he took out a pouch, which was the Demonic Sacrifice Cave Master's spirit beast pouch.</p><p>This person was skilled in insect control, and the spirit beast pouch contained seven or eight types of spirit insects.</p><p>"The old devil released the Night Shadow Insects for communication. The other spirit insects are similar to the Night Shadow Insects, only useful for support. They aren't rare spirit insects, and there aren't any unique insects among them. They have no real combat power, only special abilities, which explains why he didn't use them during our fight. It seems the old devil understands that cultivating unique insects requires a tremendous amount of resources and effort. If it weren't for the Crimsonfire Gilded Silk, I certainly wouldn't dare to keep the Skyeye Butterfly as my primary symbiotic insect…"</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense from the spirit beast pouch.</p><p>These spirit insects were carefully selected and nurtured by the Demonic Sacrifice Cave Master for who knows how many years. They might prove useful in specific situations.</p><p>Of course, they couldn’t be as powerful as the Fat Silkworm, capable of neutralizing any potent poison.</p><p>"It wouldn't hurt to keep these spirit insects. The old devil’s insect control strategy is sound. Raising them won’t consume many spirit stones, and they might actually come in handy. The old devil's insect control technique is somewhat different from the Spirit Beast Sect's. He can leave a mark within the spirit insects to forcibly control them, but this damages their potential and requires his cultivation to suppress them…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, noticing that the spirit beast pouch was of better quality than his insect basket, so he transferred the Fat Silkworm into it.</p><p>For the next few days, he kept an eye on the area outside Poison Island. Seeing that the Demonic Sacrifice Cave incident hadn't caused any further turmoil, he sealed the cave again and focused on his cultivation.</p><p>After that, every few months or a year, Bai Zhongqiu and his wife would return to the island, bringing news or the spiritual materials Qin Sang needed.</p><p>Seeing that their daughter was safe and sound, not only steadily improving her cultivation but also befriending the island master’s spirit beast, they were finally at ease.</p><p>Just like that, more than a decade passed in a flash.</p>
