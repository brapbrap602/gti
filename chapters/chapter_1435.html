<h1></h1><p>"As expected, the restrictions inside the main hall are also affected by the seal and aren't as sturdy…"</p><p>A thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and he secretly rejoiced.</p><p>If not for this, he would have been forced to change his plan.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Jewel of Purity was enveloped by demonic fire, as pure as a water droplet, without the slightest abnormality, allowing the demonic fire to carry it away.</p><p>But the instant the jewel left the altar, a demonic hand formed from demonic light howled over, carrying a gust of frigid wind, and fiercely grabbed toward the demonic fire enveloping the jewel.</p><p>Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha) lagged slightly behind, and would arrive in just an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang, within the secret passage, remained calm and composed.</p><p>His fingers moved like wheels, rapidly forming a hand seal.</p><p>At the same time, he forcefully pressed his other hand against the restriction.</p><p>With a *bang*, a corner of the secret door was shattered along the seams. Then, Qin Sang threw the Nascent Soul Puppet in his hand into the Buddha Hall.</p><p>Inside the Buddha Hall.</p><p>The demonic hand was about to grab the Jewel of Purity.</p><p>When breaking the restriction, another burst of demonic fire erupted, surging like a tidal wave, transforming into a wall of fire, and pouncing toward the demonic hand.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Buddha Hall suddenly darkened.</p><p>The Buddha statues and stone statues shook slightly.</p><p>Countless black flames, carrying an aura of destruction, burst open and scattered.</p><p>Looking at the demonic hand again, it had suffered similarly severe damage, directly reverting back to demonic light, twisting for a while, and falling apart.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun saw everything and was secretly shocked, "Just who is the other party? What kind of spirit fire is this? Although Old Devil Hunmo only made a hasty move, its power is still great enough."</p><p>Thinking in her heart, her movements didn't slow down in the slightest, and she was about to urge the Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha) to break through the demonic fire blockade.</p><p>Just at this moment, the shockwave from the collision between the demonic fire and the demonic hand swept out.</p><p>The corpses on the ground had long since decayed and turned to dust on the spot.</p><p>Several magic tools clattered and flew around.</p><p>On the altar, the Spiritual Ganoderma Scepter, losing the protection of the restriction, was also knocked off by the aftershock.</p><p>The most astonishing thing was the Buddha shrine (Fo Kan).</p><p>Struck by the aftershock, the Buddha shrine (Fo Kan) cracked with a *crack* and shattered on the spot, the Guanyin statue inside breaking into countless porcelain fragments, and was destroyed just like that.</p><p>This scene astonished the three people present.</p><p>The position of the Buddha shrine (Fo Kan) was clearly more important than the Jewel of Purity and the Spiritual Ganoderma Scepter, yet it was so fragile. Could it be an ordinary offering?</p><p>Was its importance derived from another level?</p><p>"Incomprehensible!"</p><p>The three, upon considering the reason, simultaneously had the same thought.</p><p>They didn't know how things were in ancient times, but at least in the present cultivation world, no Buddha or Dao Venerable had ever manifested their holiness. They had reached their current positions step by step, and had always only believed in themselves, unable to understand the thoughts of Buddhist disciples.</p><p>"Hopefully the Jewel of Purity isn't also just a facade."</p><p>While Qin Sang rejoiced that he hadn't chosen the Buddha shrine (Fo Kan), he suddenly felt a little worried, but things had already come to this point, and he could only trust his judgment.</p><p>The anomaly of the Buddha shrine (Fo Kan) caused them to be briefly distracted, but it didn't affect the competition for the magic treasures.</p><p>But at this moment.</p><p>From the fragments of the Buddha shrine (Fo Kan), a point of seven-colored light suddenly flashed out, illuminating their eyes.</p><p>Among the countless fragments, the seven-colored light condensed into a thumb-sized point of light, its true form actually being a crystal-clear, as if made of glazed glass, small stupa!</p><p>A seven-layered stupa, shimmering with colorful light, making it impossible to take their eyes off it.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>A treasure hidden within the Buddha shrine (Fo Kan)!</p><p>This discovery made the hearts of the three people skip a beat.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet flashed out from behind the stone statue, and charged straight towards the seven-layered stupa!</p><p>Seeing the seven-layered stupa, Qin Sang decisively changed his plan. As long as he could obtain the seven-layered stupa, the other magic treasures could be abandoned.</p><p>In a flash of lightning and flint.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet rapidly closed the distance to the seven-layered stupa.</p><p>At this time, the voice of Old Devil Hunmo resounded in Yu Yi Yuanjun's ear. After hearing Old Devil Hunmo's conditions, her expression moved slightly, and she unhesitatingly enveloped the Nascent Soul Puppet with the Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha).</p><p>Silver bell-like laughter rang out around the Nascent Soul Puppet, and soul spirits transformed into graceful women, dancing gracefully within the Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha), filled with charm, stirring up desire.</p><p>This wasn't even the most powerful method of the Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha).</p><p>The Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha) was refined by Yu Yi Yuanjun by collecting lascivious poisonous aura. Once activated, it would emit a colorless and odorless lascivious poison, arousing the desires in the depths of the opponent's heart, making it extremely difficult to defend against.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators would fall prey to it.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>In a moment of urgency, Old Devil Hunmo's palm surged with true essence, and the Black Bamboo Staff forcibly pointed out. Silently and soundlessly, a strange wave appeared in the Buddha Hall, but the demonic light underwent a bizarre change.</p><p>The demonic light was deep and restrained, re-condensing, and simultaneously rolled towards the seven-layered stupa.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Just at this time, an anomaly suddenly occurred.</p><p>A silver-white ray of lightning shot out from behind the stone statue, silently and soundlessly, hitting the demonic light that was about to touch the seven-layered stupa. The two of them had no time to stop it.</p><p>*Pa!*</p><p>The demonic light froze, and almost couldn't maintain its form, nearly collapsing on the spot.</p><p>It was Tianmudie's (Celestial Eye Butterfly) Celestial Eye Divine Light!</p><p>This divine ability had the effect of breaking laws. It could exert a surprising effect during battle, but it was difficult to find a suitable opportunity to strike. It finally displayed its power when the demonic light was just about to form.</p><p>At the same time, Yu Yi Yuanjun's surprised exclamation sounded in front of the Buddha Hall, "It's not a person!"</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo had just simultaneously broken the Buddha restriction and prevented Qin Sang from snatching the treasure, making it difficult to focus on activating his pupil technique.</p><p>During the great battle in front of the Thousand Buddha Wall, when Qin Sang released the demonic fire and the Nascent Soul Puppet, it was covered up by the chaotic power of the Thousand Buddha Wall. Old Devil Hunmo hadn't seen it with his own eyes.</p><p>The situation was pressing, and plus Qin Sang had guessed some of the effects of the Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha) and deliberately disguised himself, they weren't able to discover that the Nascent Soul Puppet wasn't a living being, but a puppet!</p><p>A puppet naturally wouldn't fear the Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha)!</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A fist forcefully smashed through the Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha).</p><p>The graceful dancers let out a miserable wail and vanished into thin air.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The doors and windows in front of the Golden Summit Main Hall suddenly shattered into pieces.</p><p>The Buddha light suddenly dimmed, and fragments of the light barrier formed by the restriction flew around. Two figures crashed through the light barrier and appeared in front of the main hall, four gazes containing anger pierced through the black flames flying everywhere, shooting towards behind the stone statue.</p><p>That fist was right under their noses, grabbing the seven-layered stupa. The Nascent Soul Puppet was as if entering an uninhabited land within the Crimson Phoenix Fury (Hongluan Sha), freely coming and going. It flashed and retreated, and avoided the Hunmo Token.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire, carrying the Jewel of Purity, was also retrieved by Qin Sang, and he also conveniently took away the Treasure Pestle.</p><p>As for the other magic treasures, Qin Sang didn't dare to be greedy anymore, otherwise he might be intercepted here by his opponents.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo and Yu Yi Yuanjun hadn't even stepped into the Buddha Hall, and they were too late for any methods.</p><p>The exchange happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang snatched the two most precious magic treasures in the main hall.</p><p>And from beginning to end, what Old Devil Hunmo and Yu Yi Yuanjun saw was only a stiff puppet. They didn't even see the true face of their opponent!</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo roared in fury, his killing intent soaring to the sky.</p><p>The terrifying aura of a Grand Cultivator was undoubtedly revealed, the Buddha statues and stone statues in the main hall trembled violently. Illusory figures of Old Devil Hunmo suddenly flashed out in the Buddha Hall, heading straight for the secret door at an alarming speed.</p><p>Inside the secret passage.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have time to inspect the effects of the three treasures. He stuffed them all into the Thousand Jun Ring. Sensing that Old Devil Hunmo was rapidly approaching, he felt a chill in his heart, flapped his Thunder Wings rapidly, and rushed into the depths of the secret passage.</p>
