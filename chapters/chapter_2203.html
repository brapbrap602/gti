<h1>Chapter 2193: Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>Celestial Dew, solidified into ice after falling from the highest heavens, must remain untouched by any impurity to become pure ice.  Celestial Dew itself is incredibly rare, its formation demanding extremely stringent conditions, highlighting the extraordinary rarity of this pure ice.</p><p>“Refining this pure ice with Ice Soul Radiance will significantly enhance its power,” said Liuli, holding the ice lovingly.</p><p>Though she’s changed her allegiance, the Ice Soul Radiance remains one of her most important foundations. Strengthening this ability will greatly benefit her future cultivation.</p><p>After clearing the pavilion, the two left the ice palace, crossed the icy plain, and continued their journey.</p><p>They encountered similar situations several times afterward, none more dangerous than the icy plain. They simply passed through them, drawing ever closer to the hidden realm Ning Zhenren had mentioned.</p><p>Whenever they had a moment, Liuli would take out the pure ice to study it.  However, refining it here was impossible due to time constraints.  She could only absorb as much of its power as possible to enhance the Ice Soul Radiance.</p><p>“This should be the final obstacle…”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the black mist ahead, speaking softly.</p><p>The black mist stretched endlessly, staining even the lake water black.  According to the map, the hidden realm should be on the other side of the mist. It's unclear if the mist itself is a product of the realm’s influence.</p><p>This area of black mist wasn't marked on either map.  It seemed they had no choice but to pass through it. Using his celestial vision, Qin Sang saw that the mist’s depths were pitch-black, strangely calm, yet eerily unsettling.</p><p>Entering the mist, they flew for a while before discovering it corroded their spiritual energy.  While their cultivation allowed them to withstand it, an unknown force permeated the mist—heavy, vast, like a slumbering beast, filling them with a sense of danger.</p><p>After careful investigation, Tianmu butterfly discovered this force wasn’t omnipresent; gaps existed, though highly concealed and difficult for ordinary people to detect.</p><p>After discussion, they decided to risk it.  Their luck held, and navigating the gaps, they safely passed through the mist's most dangerous central region.</p><p>The exit lay ahead.  Emerging from the mist, they saw an open expanse on the lake's surface, less than a hundred miles from the hidden realm.</p><p>Just as they prepared to push forward, Qin Sang paused, sensing an unusual fluctuation.  Looking towards the lake to his right, he said gravely, “Someone's coming!”</p><p>They immediately retreated back into the mist.</p><p>Moments later, a slight tremor rippled across the lake.  Deep within the spiritual mist, a streak of fiery red light flashed across the sky, disappearing instantly.</p><p>After the light vanished, Qin Sang emerged from the mist, his brow furrowed, gazing in that direction.</p><p>“Is it them?” Liuli asked.</p><p>Her investigative abilities weren't as refined as Qin Sang's; she hadn’t clearly seen the person's identity.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, hesitant. “It seems to be a cultivator from a foreign race.”</p><p>“Foreign race?”</p><p>Liuli was surprised. She'd expected other Daoist cultivators.  Judging by their flight path, they were heading towards the hidden realm.</p><p>For years, this hidden realm had been a battleground for Daoist cultivators.  What could a foreign race cultivator be doing here?</p><p>“Perhaps a foreign race cultivator discovered the opportunity here, or maybe they were hired as reinforcements,” Qin Sang speculated.</p><p>The individual arrived alone, with no one following.  After observing for a while, Qin Sang and Liuli continued their journey.  By the time they reached the hidden realm, the person was gone.</p><p>Ahead lay a vast land, the hidden realm itself.  Legend claimed this island was one of the largest in the heart lake, lush with vegetation and seemingly undamaged.</p><p>Their destination was at the island's center, but the outer areas were fraught with danger, demanding caution. The map Ning Zhenren gave them had some annotations, but they were likely unreliable.</p><p>From afar, it didn't seem so, but the moment they set foot on the island, the surrounding mist thickened considerably, creating a white blur before their eyes.</p><p>“There’s a spirit array here,” Qin Sang stated gravely.</p><p>Liuli’s expression also turned serious.  The array's scale was likely enormous, encompassing the entire island.  The fact that this array wasn't recorded in any texts indicated its recent appearance.</p><p>“Huu!”</p><p>“Huu!”</p><p>…</p><p>Suddenly, breathing sounds echoed from ahead, initially mistaken for wind.</p><p>The breaths grew closer.</p><p>“Playing tricks!”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, shooting a sword light from his sleeve, cutting through the mist and striking down.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang and Liuli heard a pained roar.  Following the sword light, they soon saw a snow-white beast resembling a tiger or leopard, but covered in fine scales.</p><p>Two strangers encountered a creature they didn't recognize, speculating it might be an extinct ancient beast.  A sword beam pierced the beast's forehead. After a brief struggle, it collapsed into the forest below.  When Qin Sang and Liuli descended, only dissipated energy and a ravaged forest remained.</p><p>"Similar to the outside beast tide," Liuli remarked.</p><p>This was their first encounter with such a beast since entering the Heart Lake. Its presence in this secluded realm felt ominous.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression changed.  He exclaimed, "Not good!"  They tried to escape, but were surrounded by white-scaled tiger demons.  Qin Sang's quick thinking prevented encirclement. They fought their way out, leaving their pursuers behind.</p><p>Expecting a respite, they were surprised by another strange beast.  They landed on a nameless peak, sitting cross-legged, not to rest, but to sense their surroundings using a technique taught by Master Ning.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke first, sensing the mountain's spiritual energy using Master Ning's technique, but found nothing.  Further exploration was needed. Liuli soon awoke, with the same result.</p><p>Consulting their map, they chose a route and continued.  Their journey was uneventful until Qin Sang exclaimed, "The fog ahead is dissipating!"</p><p>Beyond a few mountains, the sky was clear and sunny.  Qin Sang squinted at the sun, wondering if it was a reflection from the greater world.</p><p>Suspicious, they slowed their flight, remaining vigilant. They were far from the island's depths yet had already encountered many unusual things.</p><p>The sun beat down, drying the riverbed and curling the leaves of the parched plants.</p><p>"A riverbed?"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed artificial markings, signs of human habitation!  His spiritual sense confirmed it.  They soon saw terraced fields on a hillside, the crops withered from the drought.</p><p>Two figures, an elderly couple, toiled in one field, weeding under the midday sun.  A food basket sat nearby, the meal finished.  Unaware of the observers above, they worked tirelessly.</p><p>Liuli exclaimed, "They're humans!"</p><p>Qin Sang was equally surprised.  Humans living in a sacred land of the otherworldly! The place clearly had ties to humanity, explaining the Daoist disciples' persistent pilgrimages.</p><p>They both wondered if the villagers were real, or like the beasts—a figment.  If even the beasts were dormant, why were these people spared?</p><p>Observing the couple, their expressions seemed genuine. Their stories sounded authentic, as if they had lived there for decades, unlike the simple-minded beasts.  Even Qin Sang's heightened senses detected no illusion.</p><p>He landed, transforming into a dusty youth and approached the couple.  Startled, the old man called out, "Young man, where do you come from?"</p><p>"Sir," Qin Sang wiped his brow, "I'm going to the capital to see relatives. Where am I?"</p><p>The local dialect was unusual—simple and direct, perhaps due to isolation.</p><p>"Oh dear, you're lost! To the capital? How did you get here?" The old man offered a gourd. "Here, have some water."</p><p>Qin Sang drank, and they spoke. The old man, a former traveler, shared much.  This was a human nation, Bai Guo, a small country surrounded by man-eating monsters.  Its people never left, living generation after generation.  The current ruler was a just one, and the people lived peaceful lives.</p><p>His stories were consistent, detailed, and believable.</p><p>"To the capital, don't go north.  They say there are evil spirits and monsters there!" He pointed north, warning him.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that area—a dark abyss on his map, but not the human nation nearby.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang noticed swirling clouds, sensing something amiss. The sky darkened, and an evil wind blew.  He prepared to protect the couple, but paused, watching the wind pass harmlessly through them.</p><p>A malevolent wind eroded flesh and bone, instantly reducing the elderly couple to skeletons that were then scattered by the wind.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly as they died, until the wind subsided.  Two figures then materialized before him—the elderly couple, inexplicably resurrected!</p><p>"Young man, farewell.  Travel safely!"</p><p>The old man enthusiastically waved, his demeanor unchanged from moments before.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to repeatedly examine the couple, finding them exactly as they had been before—completely normal.</p><p>"Is it an illusion?"  Liuli arrived beside Qin Sang, frowning.</p><p>"If it is, it's an incredibly sophisticated one!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. As his Tianmu Butterfly cultivation deepened, his divine eye abilities had grown stronger, rarely encountering illusions he couldn't see through.  He had observed not only the couple but also the surrounding villages and cities; these villagers had lived and died generation after generation, their lives indistinguishable from ordinary people. Except for their illusory nature, their life experiences were real, making the illusion indistinguishable from reality.</p><p>Why was this perfect illusion disrupted by the malevolent wind, and how did the wind even originate?</p><p>They soared to high altitudes, soon reaching the capital city of the Bai Kingdom.  While the Bai people weren't primitive, their lives were simple and not affluent, lacking sophisticated art; they valued strength and grandeur.</p><p>Finding no useful clues, they flew away from Bai, encountering thick fog further on.</p><p>"There might be more than just Bai Kingdom here; the fog seems to separate the lands," Liuli said.</p><p>However, neither thick fog nor the beasts were mentioned in the records; what did the previous illusion look like?</p><p>Continuing their journey, they traveled through the fog.  Qin Sang pointed to the distance.  "Panlong Cave is over there."</p><p>The records described Panlong Cave as one of the island's most dangerous places, containing both peril and opportunity, but it wasn't their objective. However, they still investigated its vicinity for any changes.</p><p>Leaving the fog, they indeed saw another country, similar in culture and customs to Bai.</p><p>Crossing this country, they re-entered the fog. Qin Sang suddenly sensed a familiar, rapidly approaching energy—the malevolent wind!</p><p>Outside the fog, the wind was like an ordinary gale, but within, it wreaked havoc, its power incomparable.</p><p>The wind attacked fiercely.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli quickly activated their protective artifacts. Qin Sang even summoned his Mingshan Armor, and Liuli's ice-based armor appeared.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The wind howled, stirring the clouds.</p><p>The surrounding area was filled with chaotic power, crashing against them like a turbulent current.</p><p>They steadied themselves and moved against the wind, but the wind seemed boundless, its power growing.  The world around them was a vast, desolate expanse.</p><p>Realizing the wind’s danger, they dared not linger, accelerating forward.  After traversing countless mountains, they were finally nearing the edge of the wind's reach.</p><p>At that moment, a figure appeared in the distance, also battling the wind.</p><p>Both sensed each other and simultaneously stopped, wary.</p><p>"Could it be the one who entered earlier?" Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The other party didn't conceal themselves; their aura was comparable to a late-stage Refinement Void cultivator, a top expert from a different race.</p><p>As the wind receded, their figures were revealed. From across the mountains, Qin Sang saw a stranger in green robes.</p><p>The man, upon seeing Qin Sang and Liuli, showed a momentary surprise, then slowly retreated.</p><p>"He recognizes me!"</p><p>Qin Sang noted the man's fleeting expression.  He was only known in the Zhuyan and Siyou tribes, and the stranger wasn't among the other cultivators who had entered; why would he recognize him?</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.  He gestured to approach, calling out, "Friend, please wait!"</p>
