<h1>Chapter 1999: Subduing the Corpse King</h1><p>Chapter 1999: Subduing the Corpse King</p><p>The Corpse King suddenly clutched its head, letting out a shrill, pained cry.  Bai stopped in front, eyes filled with ecstatic joy.</p><p>“It’s working!”</p><p>Qin Sang was equally surprised.  Through the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, Bai was actually affecting the Corpse King.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to wield the ebony sword, aiming for the Corpse King's neck. The Corpse King let out a ferocious roar. Bai's actions, whether triggering unbearable memories or inflicting extreme pain, had made him a target of the Corpse King’s burning hatred.  Even as sword energy attacked, the Corpse King remained fixated on Bai, its animosity palpable.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The sword’s attack only tore through the corpse energy on the Corpse King’s surface, failing to harm its true body.  The Corpse King didn't even turn its head, ignoring the sneak attack.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai dared not be negligent. He continuously activated the Heavenly Corpse Talisman within the Corpse King, merging his body with ghost energy as he retreated.</p><p>Seeing the Corpse King ignore her, Qin Sang sneered silently. He flicked his sleeve, and the demonic banner flew before him.</p><p>It wasn't time for a decisive blow yet. Qin Sang temporarily brought out nine demonic banners, secretly preparing the remaining three. Nine Netherworld demonic flames erupted, transforming into fiery spears. A sizzling sound echoed as the surrounding ghost energy was scorched and burned away.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang subtly moved his mind, raising his hand. The fire spears shot directly towards the Corpse King's back.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>As expected, the fire spears were shattered by the Corpse King, but immediately afterwards, an overwhelming torrent of Nine Netherworld demonic flames engulfed the Corpse King before it could react.</p><p>Instantly, the Corpse King was enveloped in flames, the aura of the Nine Netherworld demonic fire unmistakable!  The Corpse King, feeling the pain and sensing the danger, finally dared not underestimate this harassing opponent any longer, its corpse energy surging as it forcibly broke through the flames.</p><p>In the brief clash, the Corpse King's black fur was completely burned away by the demonic fire, leaving it looking rather disheveled, though without significant injuries.  Bai seized the opportunity to accelerate his actions.</p><p>On the Corpse King's forehead, a faint talisman shadow appeared, bringing it even greater agony.  The Corpse King roared repeatedly, continuing its pursuit, creating another perilous scene.</p><p>Fortunately, Bai’s integration with the ghost energy allowed for swift evasion. And with Qin Sang's occasional interventions, he managed to hold on.</p><p>As time passed, the corpse energy on the Corpse King grew thinner, the crimson in its eyes dimmed, and its speed slowed. The two became increasingly composed.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the process to go so smoothly.  At its peak, this Corpse King was equivalent to a Nascent Soul early-stage cultivator; however, affected by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, its power had been greatly diminished, posing less of a threat.</p><p>Still, capturing the Corpse King would require more effort.  Ordinary methods were unlikely to cause it serious harm.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang heard Bai’s urgent voice, "It's almost the limit. This fiend is still struggling. If we take too long, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman's effect might weaken. I'll keep it occupied; you find an opportunity to attack!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement, secretly taking out the other three demonic banners and consuming Soul-Washing Liquid and pills to replenish his true energy. He looked ahead.</p><p>The battlefield had shifted to the center of the deep pit, the Corpse King's lair. The tide had turned, and Bai now had the ability to engage the Corpse King.</p><p>The Corpse King raged, using every means at its disposal, but it couldn't overcome Bai's turtle shell protection. However, Bai could also only inflict superficial wounds, even when his ghost energy-formed blades broke through the corpse energy and struck the Corpse King's flesh.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, quietly moving to the edge of the deep pit, avoiding the Corpse King's line of sight. He established a hidden position and then activated the twelve demonic banners to form an array!</p><p>The demonic banners fell into place, their flags flapping in the wind.  Qin Sang’s expression eased slightly, a sigh of relief escaping him.</p><p>He was seven or eight tenths sure, but he'd also worried about losing control of the banners and ruining everything.  Luckily, his experience had improved his control of both the banner array and the fire lotus. The consumption of true energy to control the demonic fire was less than before, and the Soul-Washing Liquid and pills were sufficient.</p><p>While setting up the array, Qin Sang transmitted a message to Bai.</p><p>*Bang bang bang!*</p><p>Loud booms echoed from the deep pit.  The battle between Bai and the Corpse King intensified.</p><p>On the surface, Bai’s display of power surpassed even the Corpse King.  A ceaseless torrent of ghostly energy was drawn to him, forming towering waves that assaulted the Corpse King.</p><p>The Corpse King’s body was battered; a metallic sheen flowed across its skin as it resisted, surging forward undeterred.</p><p>Bai feigned defeat, retreating methodically to lure the Corpse King towards Qin Sang’s hiding place.</p><p>The next moment, the twelve-banner demonic array was complete!</p><p>The array was formed.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes and transmitted a command:  “Attack!”</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The demonic banners resonated.</p><p>Streams of demonic fire shot forth from the banners, converging at the array’s center into a raging inferno. Qin Sang then touched it, and before it fully coalesced, propelled it directly at the Corpse King!</p><p>This attack nearly depleted Qin Sang’s spiritual energy and consciousness.  If the Corpse King targeted him now, he would be utterly defenseless.</p><p>A flash of white light.</p><p>Bai He arrived just in time, carrying Qin Sang away from the battle.</p><p>The Corpse King wasn't entirely mindless.</p><p>Having suffered from the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire before, it sensed the even greater threat posed by this new attack, its bloodshot eyes flickering as it instinctively recoiled.</p><p>Bai, prepared for this, immediately reversed his retreat and counterattacked.</p><p>“Gather!”</p><p>Bai roared, and the surrounding ghostly energy surged wildly toward the Corpse King, forming spectral tendrils like chains, creating a cage.</p><p>Their teamwork was seamless, allowing the Corpse King no respite.</p><p>Even a moment’s confinement was enough.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire followed swiftly.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire erupted!</p><p>Fire scattered everywhere, the battlefield plunged into chaos, filled with drifting black demonic flames.</p><p>The Corpse King, at the heart of the explosion, vanished from sight.</p><p>Then, a deafening, anguished roar echoed forth.  The demonic flames pulsed—the Corpse King lived.</p><p>Bai wasn’t surprised. He watched the heart of the flames intently.</p><p>Qin Sang was incapacitated.  If this blow hadn’t grievously wounded the Corpse King, continuing the fight was pointless.</p><p>Finally, the Corpse King burst from the flames.</p><p>Seeing the Corpse King’s state, a look of triumph spread across Bai’s face.</p><p>The Corpse King was covered in wounds; its skin was cracked, its chest blown open revealing bone, its face torn, and one eye was gone.  It looked even more ferocious and terrifying, but its aura was undeniably weakening!</p><p>Bai laughed triumphantly, and pivoting, turned defense into attack!</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, hiding in the distance, was unable to fight.  Since Bai hadn’t signaled for his assistance, the situation must be stable.  He saved a drop of Three Lights Jade Liquid, sitting cross-legged, recovering with pills and spirit stones.</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang summoned his Sky Eye Butterfly for protection, and sent Bai He to assist, aiming for a swift victory.</p><p>In the deep pit, the battle continued.</p><p>The Corpse King’s roars continued, but now held a hollow ring.</p><p>After some time, the Corpse King’s cries finally ceased.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped meditating, opened his eyes, and stood, just as he saw Bai swiftly approaching, carrying the Corpse King’s mangled remains.</p>
