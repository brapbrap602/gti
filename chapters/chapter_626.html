<h1>Chapter 618: Witch God Continent</h1><p>“Thank you for your help!”</p><p>The three, still shaken, bowed to the Flying Night Rakshasa in gratitude.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa had only assisted them in killing the Blood Winged Hornets and retrieving the hive; it hadn't displayed overwhelming power.</p><p>With their level of experience, they couldn't fully gauge the Rakshasa's strength. However, after the battle, it was clear the Rakshasa was far stronger than the young man, whose tone was quite respectful.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa stood there silently, holding the hive.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, looking at each other uncertainly.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows. Like the Flying Night Rakshasa, he wore a cloak that concealed most of his body.</p><p>“It was nothing,”</p><p>Qin Sang said as he approached, under their wary gazes. “This is my puppet. I'm traveling for training, and got lost.  I saw you three under attack by the hornets and ordered my puppet to intervene.”</p><p>The three visibly relaxed.</p><p>The young man stepped forward. “I am Yuan Hu of the Five Insects Sect. These two are the High Priestess and the Junior Priestess of the Sky Moon Village. May I ask your name, friend?”</p><p>“Call me Mingyue.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare use his Daoist name, Qingfeng. He instructed the Flying Night Rakshasa to examine the hive.  Inside were Blood Winged Hornet larvae.</p><p>The adult Blood Winged Hornets, having killed so many and reverting to their ferocious nature, could not be subdued. Qin Sang had killed them all, leaving only the larvae.</p><p>“Mingyue…”</p><p>The three exchanged glances again. They’d never heard the name. They wanted to invite Qin Sang to Sky Moon Village.</p><p>Qin Sang declined. “I've been in secluded cultivation for many years and my cultivation has recently improved. I intended to travel, but I got lost and happened upon you. Could you direct me?”</p><p>“Certainly!”</p><p>Yuan Hu produced a jade slip and with a gesture, sent it floating towards Qin Sang. “Daoist Mingyue, this is a topographical map provided by my sect. It marks nearby paths and dangers. Please follow its directions.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted as he took the jade slip and used his weak spiritual sense to examine it.  He was disappointed to find it only mapped a large area nearby.</p><p>The most prominent features on the map were a high mountain called Xiong Mountain, and the Five Insects Sect’s location.  Beyond that, it marked some large villages, including Sky Moon Village. Sky Moon Village was mid-ranking; Thousand Households Village wasn’t even marked. The Five Insects Sect appeared to be the strongest force in the area.</p><p>Having seen the map’s contents, Qin Sang had a general understanding of the power structures around Xiong Mountain, but this wasn't what he urgently needed to know.</p><p>“Daoist Yuan, does your sect’s map only cover this area? I’ve only recently left home and am unfamiliar with the outside world. How much does your sect know about other areas?”</p><p>“Maps of other areas are beyond my cultivation level for now, but my senior brothers in the sect have them. If you wish, you can come back to the sect with me, and I can ask a senior brother to lend you one.”</p><p>Yuan Hu explained, “The sect’s treasured maps not only cover other parts of our Western Frontier, but also many powerful factions and dangerous places across the entire Witch God Continent. However, we know nothing of the seas beyond the Witch God Continent. You’ll have to ask those powerful factions outside.”</p><p>Witch God Continent!</p><p>Qin Sang, hearing this unfamiliar name, breathed a sigh of relief. A landmass named a continent must be vast; he had left Little Cold Domain.</p><p>Hearing Yuan Hu mention the seas beyond the continent, Qin Sang's curiosity was piqued.</p><p>“They say that our Witch God Continent is just the largest island in a vast ocean.  In the past, not only the Witch God Continent, but the islands beyond belonged to our Witch Cultivators. Then the despicable humans stole our cultivation resources and drove us from our homeland. Now, we Witch Cultivators are forced to cultivate only on the Witch God Continent and the surrounding islands…”</p><p>Yuan Hu spoke of human cultivators with seething anger.  His cultivation was low and his knowledge limited; many things he said were hearsay and unclear, but it was enough for Qin Sang to gather some information.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished. He thought he had been transported to a strange continent, but it turned out to be a boundless sea.</p><p>The cultivators here were divided into humans and witches, and they weren't harmonious; they had fought wars.  The humans thrived, while the witches were confined to the Witch God Continent.</p><p>According to Yuan Hu, the Witch God Continent was large, but he didn't have a precise idea of its size.</p><p>Qin Sang was eager to learn about the outside world, but he ultimately refused Yuan Hu's invitation. Knowing this wasn't Little Cold Domain, Qin Sang felt relieved.</p><p>He didn't know the Five Insects Sect's strength or character. Seeing Yuan Hu practiced necromancy, he didn’t seem trustworthy.  His priority was to find a place to heal and form his Golden Core.</p><p>He could pay a visit after he regained his strength.</p><p>His request was refused, but Yuan Hu didn't mind.  Warmly, he said, "Friend Daoist, if you're not in a hurry to leave, you could wait a few days. Before the annual Wu Shen Festival, the bimo and priests from the various villages in our Xiong Mountain region hold a gathering here, exchanging information and goods.  Whether you're looking for information or trading treasures, it's an opportunity not to be missed."</p><p>Qin Sang's interest piqued. This was a good chance to gather information.</p><p>He still had much to investigate:  news of Elder Qingzhu, whether there were hidden realms or ancient restrictions near the ruins—anything that might lead him to an ancient teleportation array.</p><p>He was only temporarily seeking refuge; he couldn't settle down.  His Nine Illusory Sky Orchid was still in Xiao Han Domain, and he had to return before forming his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Yuan Hu's cultivation was too low; his knowledge was limited.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly inquired about the gathering's date, calculating that it would give him ample time to heal and form his Golden Core.</p><p>After further pleasantries, Qin Sang decided to take his leave. Having consulted the geomantic map, he knew where to look for spirit veins.</p><p>"Friend Daoist, wait!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang about to depart, Yuan Hu hastily stopped him, blushing slightly. "I have a small request.  Would you be willing to leave one of those strange bee larvae with me?"</p><p>They had already been in great danger.  The appearance of the Flying Night Rakshasa had only just allowed them to eliminate the Blood-Winged Ghost Bees and save themselves.  Logically, the hive was Qin Sang's spoils; they had no claim to a share.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to the spirit insects of the two Tianyue Village priests, surprised. "Daoist friend, with your cultivation, you don't yet have…"</p><p>"No, no…"</p><p>Yuan Hu shook his head repeatedly. "I already have a lifebound insect-gu. I was concentrating on controlling the bone skeletons and didn't release it. I just think these strange bees are quite powerful, and I've never seen them before. They're not even recorded in the Wu Insect Chart, which piqued my curiosity."</p><p>So they were called lifebound insect-gu.</p><p>The Wu Insect Chart.</p><p>Qin Sang silently memorized these names, guessing that the Wu Insect Chart was similar to the Mystical Insect Chart of the Yu Ling Sect.</p><p>It seemed that the Wu cultivators' understanding of spirit insects was more comprehensive and profound than the Yu Ling Sect's, even refining spirit insects into lifebound insect-gu. The Wu Insect Chart must be far more systematic than the Mystical Insect Chart.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>(Thank you to Da Hongzao Mama for the generous contribution!
