<h1>Chapter 475: The Location of the Cultivation Technique</h1><p>There are records of only one person successfully forming their Gold Core after cultivating it.</p><p>Qingzhu!</p><p>"...You must know him. That man's name is Qingzhu. He was quite famous in Shaohua Mountain. Some even called him the Sword Demon."</p><p>Granny Jing said.</p><p>It really was him!</p><p>When Granny Jing mentioned the creator of the self-made cultivation technique, Qin Sang immediately thought of Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>In the cave of the Le sisters years ago, Qin Sang discovered the sword marks left by Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>At that time, he guessed that Senior Qingzhu had continued down the path of slaughter, either having found the latter half of the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture" or having created a follow-up technique himself.</p><p>Whether in his sect, at Hanging Skull Pass, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, or even in the Chaotic Isles these past three years, Qin Sang had never stopped searching for traces of Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>He found nothing.</p><p>"After Senior Qingzhu disappeared, the sect also lost track of him. There was only a dubious rumor about him in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. This junior has been searching for Senior Qingzhu for many years, but hasn't found a single trace... Senior, have you perhaps met Senior Qingzhu?"</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recounted his search, asking Granny Jing.</p><p>"Of course, you couldn't find him."</p><p>Granny Jing's expression was unreadable as she said in a flat tone, "Because he died in the Violet Firmament Palace."</p><p>Dead?</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>A legend of Shaohua Mountain, a man of astonishing talent, an inspiration to countless younger disciples, his legend still circulated within the sect, and he was just... dead?</p><p>Without a sound, he perished in the Violet Firmament Palace.</p><p>No one knew except Granny Jing.</p><p>Qin Sang had never met Senior Qingzhu, but he felt a connection with him.</p><p>Hearing this news, he couldn't help but feel a sense of grief.</p><p>Only those who had cultivated the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture" could understand how great Senior Qingzhu was.</p><p>Without the Jade Buddha's protection, Qin Sang knew he wouldn't have lasted this long.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu's shocking act of splitting his soul and resisting the soul-devouring sword Qi and the erosion of killing intent with his powerful will was unprecedented and unparalleled.</p><p>How could one not admire him?</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, Senior Qingzhu should have been one of the most qualified cultivators to reach the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Such a person, just dead?</p><p>The Violet Firmament Palace!</p><p>If it was the Violet Firmament Palace, it made sense.</p><p>There were legends of even Nascent Soul Grandmasters perishing within the Violet Firmament Palace. It wasn't strange for Qingzhu to die there, but it was such a pity!</p><p>"I wonder where Senior Qingzhu's remains are buried?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked, intending to find time to pay his respects.</p><p>Granny Jing shook her head. "His body is still in the Violet Firmament Palace, in a place heavily restricted, inaccessible to others."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "If Senior didn't retrieve Senior Qingzhu's body, how did you obtain the follow-up technique? Were you and Senior Qingzhu old friends, and did he give you the technique?"</p><p>Granny Jing didn't answer Qin Sang's second question. "I didn't get the follow-up technique. I only know that Qingzhu left it where he died. Only those who have cultivated the 'Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture' can enter that place. If you want the follow-up technique, you can only get it yourself."</p><p>"Go to the Violet Firmament Palace myself..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He suddenly realized something and said in shock, "Only those who have cultivated the 'Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture' can enter... Does this cultivation technique have something to do with the Violet Firmament Palace?"</p><p>Granny Jing retorted, "Don't you know that the 'Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture' was originally brought out of the Violet Firmament Palace by an ancestor of your Shaohua Mountain?"</p><p>Qin Sang really didn't know.</p><p>There were no records about the origins of the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture" in Pagoda Peak. Those he knew well, including Qi Yuanshou, were unaware of this secret.</p><p>There were quite a few incomplete cultivation techniques similar to the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture" in Pagoda Peak, with various origins, and very few could be successfully cultivated.</p><p>The "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture" was actually related to the ancient immortal palace, the Violet Firmament Palace. No wonder the technique's divine abilities were so powerful. If it weren't for the fact that only incomplete fragments remained, cultivators throughout the entire Xiaohan Region would probably be fighting over it, and Shaohua Mountain wouldn't be able to keep it.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, calmed his thoughts, and after a moment of consideration, said solemnly, "Senior wouldn't tell this junior about Senior Qingzhu and the whereabouts of the follow-up technique for no reason, right? This junior has also heard about the Violet Firmament Palace. It's full of countless dangers. Even Nascent Soul and Gold Core cultivators have to be extremely careful. It's not a place for Foundation Establishment cultivators like me to venture into."</p><p>It seemed that Granny Jing had known he cultivated the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture" for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected that Granny Jing had seen through him during their first meeting in the Asking Moon Market.</p><p>Back then, Granny Jing had included him in her secret market without any investigation. Qin Sang thought it was because of Shaohua Mountain, but now it seemed that it had something to do with the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture."</p><p>She knew about it before but only mentioned it now.</p><p>Qin Sang could only think of one reason for Granny Jing's change of heart.</p><p>The Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Blood Defilement Divine Light!</p><p>Granny Jing nodded, admitting frankly, "You are the second person I know who can cultivate the 'Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture' to this level. It's a pity you haven't formed your Gold Core yet. You guessed correctly. I do need your natal spirit sword to help me with something. The Blood Defilement Divine Light is not a common divine ability."</p><p>As expected, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, gave a dry laugh, and tentatively asked, "Senior wouldn't want me to use my natal spirit sword against Sect Master Leng Yuntian of the Yuan Mirage Sect, would you?"</p><p>He had heard clearly that Granny Jing's trip was originally aimed at Leng Yuntian, but only a Grand Elder came.</p><p>Seeing Granny Jing actually nod, Qin Sang's smile completely disappeared.</p><p>He couldn't see Granny Jing's true strength, but it probably wasn't much stronger than Leng Yuntian's, otherwise she wouldn't have to resort to such elaborate schemes.</p><p>The Blood Defilement Divine Light was indeed powerful, capable of disabling magic treasures for a short time, but it was only effective against magic treasures and had no effect on the cultivators themselves.</p><p>A Nascent Soul Grandmaster wouldn't rely solely on one magic treasure, would they?</p><p>He wasn't arrogant enough to face a Nascent Soul Grandmaster directly.</p><p>Getting involved in a fight between Nascent Soul Grandmasters, even being grazed by the aftershocks, would mean certain death.</p><p>"Rumor has it that Leng Yuntian is a Nascent Soul Grandmaster..."</p><p>Granny Jing sneered, mockingly, "A pseudo-Nascent Soul, that's all! When Leng Yuntian was at the late Gold Core stage, he was severely injured in the Violet Firmament Palace, leaving behind a fatal hidden danger. Later, his master, Leng Qian, risked his life to barely help Leng Yuntian break through the bottleneck before passing away. But the hidden danger remains, and his cultivation will never be comparable to a true Nascent Soul cultivator. He's at most slightly stronger than a late Gold Core cultivator at the peak, relying entirely on an ancestral magic treasure. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been hiding in the Yuan Mirage Sect all this time, not even daring to come personally to steal the Star Origin Stones. If it weren't for the opening of the Violet Firmament Palace, he would continue to be a coward!"</p><p>Leng Qian was the previous Sect Master of the Yuan Mirage Sect.</p><p>A renowned and truly established Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"The Violet Firmament Palace is divided into an inner hall and an outer hall. Qingzhu died in the inner hall. Without reaching the Gold Core stage, it's extremely difficult to move even a single step in the outer hall. After entering the inner hall, it's actually safer if you don't trespass into the ancient halls. If you agree, I can take you to the entrance of the inner hall and guide you on how to reach that place..."</p><p>Granny Jing said.</p>
