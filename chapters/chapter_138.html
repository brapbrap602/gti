**Chapter 131: Leaving Under Protection**

When Sect Master Yu arrived, the cave residence was wide open, and Qin Sang was standing at the entrance, gazing into the distance. It was the first time he had been in the mood to truly observe the vast expanse of the Yuncang Marshlands.

The boundless marsh was a monochrome of water and sky.

As far as the eye could see, nothing was out of reach.

Catching sight of a sword light breaking through the void, Qin Sang offered a distant bow. “Disciple greets Sect Master.”

“Congratulations, Qin… Junior Brother Qin!”

Sect Master Yu retracted his escape light and cast a glance at Qin Sang. He seemed even more pleased than Qin Sang himself. “Junior Brother Qin, no need for formalities. According to the conventions of the cultivation world, you and I are now both Foundation Establishment cultivators, so we should treat each other as equals. I am a few years your senior. If you don’t mind, you can call me Senior Brother.”

“Greetings, Senior Brother Sect Master.”

Qin Sang followed suit and switched his form of address, but he did not neglect his manners. “All that I have today is thanks to Senior Brother Sect Master’s patronage.”

Sect Master Yu caressed his beard and smiled. He thought to himself that this young man was both polite and modest. All his efforts had not been in vain.

Although he had been sent away to be a cauldron, if by some chance Cultivator Mamao’s heart were stirred, it was not impossible that Qin Sang could be reborn as the dual cultivation partner of a Golden Core cultivator.

“That Profound Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture…”

Qin Sang nodded and said, “I have already successfully established my foundation, Junior Brother. I have not dared to disturb Senior Brother Sect Master. I have also mastered the third layer of the Profound Yin Jade Cauldron Scripture. Now that the Jade Cauldron is complete and the jade liquid is full, I await Senior Brother Sect Master’s instructions on what to do, and I will definitely carry them out.”

Sect Master Yu nodded and said, “It is good that you have this in mind, Junior Brother Qin. Please wait a moment, and I will report to Uncle Master Mamao.”

With that, Sect Master Yu sent out a sword talisman. The two stood outside the cave residence and waited quietly. Qin Sang watched as the sword talisman flew away, and his heart suddenly filled with trepidation. He had already prepared himself psychologically, but when the moment came, he was still filled with worry.

The sword talisman flew into the distance.

Before long, a silver-white light suddenly lit up in the depths of the Yuncang Marshlands. It approached with startling speed, and a small white flying boat hovered in front of them in a flash.

Sect Master Yu nodded in understanding and turned to Qin Sang. “Junior Brother Qin, Cultivator Mamao has sent a magical tool to escort you. Follow the magical tool. Senior Brother will not see you off.”

Qin Sang took a deep breath and was about to step up when Sect Master Yu called out to him and handed him a jade bottle.

“This is the Nine Yang Pill. If it is useful to you, remember not to delay too long. Quickly find a place to consume the Nine Yang Pill, refine its medicinal power, and reshape your foundation. That is when the medicinal efficacy will be at its best. Otherwise, if your Qi Sea shatters, all will be lost. After everything is settled, make sure to return to the Sect Master Peak, where I will alter your Jade Register. There are many benefits that only senior disciples are entitled to. Do not forget to claim them.”

“Thank you for your concern, Senior Brother Sect Master.”

Qin Sang took the jade bottle and saw a large, crimson-red pill inside. He could sense the pure yang energy emanating from the spirit pill without even opening the bottle. It was an excellent tonic spirit pill.

After bidding farewell to Sect Master Yu, Qin Sang boarded the flying boat and felt his feet tremble beneath him. In the blink of an eye, he had already traveled hundreds of feet away.

The flying boat was as fast as lightning. In no time at all, it had flown out of the range of the Lesser Mount Hua sect gate. Still, the flying boat did not stop. It entered the depths of the marsh, and countless small islands and verdant mountain peaks drifted past beneath them. Gradually, the land became less and less frequent, and only scattered islets remained.

The fastest magical tool that Qin Sang had ridden before was the flying shuttle that his three granduncles had jointly controlled when he had first joined the Specterbane Sect. Compared to this flying boat, it had been as slow as a snail.

After flying for a while longer, the speed of the flying boat decreased sharply. Finally, it landed on an island in the sky.

Qin Sang looked down. This island was not large. It was slightly larger than the deserted island where his cave residence was located. What was strange was that the island was perfectly round. A thin mist hung over the island, and two mountain ranges could be vaguely seen on either side. A stream meandered through the valley below, and the vegetation was lush and green, with exotic flowers and plants, making for a magnificent view.

The flying boat slowly descended, and the clouds on the island parted automatically to the sides. Qin Sang felt a sense of connection and realized that the clouds were actually a strange phenomenon caused by a formation.

Just the slight aura that had leaked out when the formation had opened earlier had filled Qin Sang with terror and deterred him from acting rashly.

Upon entering the island, Qin Sang immediately felt an extremely dense aura. He knew that this small island was probably not as simple as just a spirit spring. His cave residence could not compare to this place by far.

After all, this was a Golden Core cultivator’s cave residence. He could only envy it.

‘Swish!’

The flying boat carried Qin Sang to a thatched hut in the valley and dropped him off before turning around and leaving immediately, leaving Qin Sang a little surprised.

Qin Sang looked around. The thatched hut was not large. Its doors and windows were closed, and there was not a sound to be heard inside.

- He did not dare to use his divine sense to check, for fear of offending her. He stood solemnly in front of the door and waited for a long time, but no one spoke inside. He could not help but feel a little strange, so he could not help but bow and said softly, "Disciple Qin Sang, I pay my respects to Uncle Ma Wu."
Still no answer.
Is there no one in the house?
Qin Sang was puzzled and did not know what had happened. He was just left outside like this and did not dare to leave without permission. He waited a whole night and another day.
Late at night, the moon was white.
Suddenly, with a creak, the wooden door opened automatically, and a cold voice came out, "Come in."
What a nice voice.
Qin Sang was startled and quickly cleaned up the non-existent dust on his body. He solemnly straightened his face, raised his foot and walked in. At a glance, he saw a young woman sitting in the wooden house under the candlelight. She seemed to have been sitting there all night.
"Disciple pays respects to..."
Qin Sang was about to bow down when he caught a glimpse of the woman's appearance out of the corner of his eye and was suddenly stunned.
He had heard the name of the Immortal Fairy of Morning Mist more than once in Mount Shaohua. Whenever anyone mentioned the Immortal Fairy of Morning Mist, they were all intoxicated. Even the female senior sisters, as long as they had seen the true appearance of the Immortal Fairy of Morning Mist, were all infatuated.
He was curious, so he asked Zhuang Yan for the portrait that was secretly circulated in Mount Shaohua. It was said that it was made by a senior brother who was known as a master of brushwork in the mortal world.
The woman in the painting was accompanied by white clouds and cranes, her clothes fluttering. She was indeed independent from the world and had an immortal temperament. She was a beautiful woman who was hard to find in the world.
Now it seems that the charm of the portrait is not even one ten-thousandth of the real person.
Qin Sang was not overwhelmed by her appearance, but he was shocked. It was clearly said that it was Master Ma Wu, so why was the person in the wooden house the Immortal Fairy of Morning Mist?
"Morning Mist..."
Qin Sang opened his mouth and stammered a little. He suddenly realized that he did not know how to address the Immortal Fairy of Morning Mist. Her origin seemed to be very mysterious. When the disciples in the sect mentioned her, they all called her the Immortal Fairy, and did not call her the Master Ancestor according to the convention.
"Disciple Qin Sang, I pay my respects to Immortal Fairy Morning Mist."
Qin Sang calmed down and bowed deeply. His eyes were on the light and shadow on the ground, and his heart was in turmoil. He did not know what the situation was.
At this time, he suddenly remembered that the Immortal Fairy of Morning Mist had been in seclusion for 20 years in order to form her Nascent Soul. When he had just entered Mount Shaohua, the Immortal Fairy of Morning Mist was still in seclusion on the Pure Moon Peak. She had only left seclusion recently, and it was said that she had failed to break through to the Nascent Soul stage.
Could it be that it was not Master Ma Wu, but...
...
Dongfang Bai.
Qin Sang supported himself against the wall and walked out.
His eyes were lifeless, his complexion was sallow, and his hair was gray.
