Chapter 589: Mid-Grade Magical Treasure

After the repair of the two Ten Directions Yama Banners, Qin Sang's strength has significantly increased.

The complete array of the Ten Directions Yama Banners requires all ten banners, but arrays can also be formed with three, six, or nine banners.

Three demonic banners form the simplest banner array, capable of unleashing power comparable to a mid-grade magical treasure.

Six banners form an array that can contend with a high-grade magical treasure.

Nine banners form a top-tier high-grade magical treasure!

Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivators have the opportunity to upgrade their natal magical treasure to mid-grade.  Yi Tiannie, as the sect leader with the legacy of Kiu Yin Old Ancestor, doesn't lack mid-grade magical treasures.

However, high-grade magical treasures are not so easily obtained; some Nascent Soul cultivators don't even possess one, unless they have a great stroke of luck to obtain one during the Foundation Establishment stage.

Top-grade magical treasures are even rarer, extremely uncommon throughout the cultivation world.

After Kiu Yin Old Ancestor's passing, only five Ten Directions Yama Banners remained.  Had there been one more, the outcome of the battle with the Yuanzhao Sect might have been different.

The Ten Directions Yama Banners' unique nature isn't due to Kiu Yin Old Ancestor's exquisite refinement techniques, but rather their inherent properties.

This brings us to the third and most crucial part of the Ten Directions Yama Banners, the very foundation of the treasure—the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire!

Without the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, the Ten Directions Yama Banners are just ten useless flags.

Qin Sang had a premonition that the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was extraordinary, likely an external object rather than something artificially refined by Kiu Yin Old Ancestor; soul searching confirmed this.

Kiu Yin Old Ancestor discovered a peculiar mass of demonic fire in the Ziwei Palace.

At the time, Kiu Yin Old Ancestor was already a Nascent Soul expert.  Entering the Ziwei Palace, he accidentally discovered this demonic fire and attempted to probe it.  He was immediately counterattacked, nearly incinerated, and almost perished.

He only escaped with his life after sacrificing a precious magical treasure.

Comparing the description of the true Nine Netherworld Demon Fire with the Zu Sheng Fire of the Qingyang Demon Sect, Qin Sang felt the former was far stronger.

Bear in mind that the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire Kiu Yin Old Ancestor encountered was a single mass, while the Zu Sheng Fire occupied the peak of Shen Gang Mountain; their scales were incomparable.

Having lost a treasure and narrowly escaping death, Kiu Yin Old Ancestor was heartbroken yet captivated by the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's terrifying power.

Upon discovering the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was unclaimed, Kiu Yin Old Ancestor became ambitious.  If he could control such powerful demonic fire, his strength would skyrocket, and dominating the entire Xiaohan Domain would be easy.

During that trip to the Ziwei Palace, Kiu Yin Old Ancestor focused solely on the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, becoming gradually familiar with it, yet ultimately failing to subdue it.

The true Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was too terrifying and incredibly volatile; it couldn't be tamed by human effort.  A single misstep meant incineration.

However, Kiu Yin Old Ancestor never gave up, because he discovered a mysterious iron pillar near the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.

The iron pillar was broken in two.  Both its material and the restrictions upon it were incredibly mysterious—unlike anything Kiu Yin Old Ancestor had ever seen. The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire seemed to fear this pillar, trapped and unable to leave the area.

The iron pillar acted as a cage, a seal.

Even in its broken state, it still contained the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.

The Ziwei Palace was about to close, requiring immediate departure.  However, Kiu Yin Old Ancestor already conceived a plan to subdue the demonic fire.

He took the broken section of the iron pillar, meticulously studied it for over a hundred years, and finally found a way to refine it.

Utilizing spirit arrays, ghost path techniques, and adapting a demonic banner array refinement method, he refined the iron pillar into the ten Ten Directions Yama Banners.

Finally, on his next visit to the Ziwei Palace, he subdued the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire!

The true Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's power was too frightening. Kiu Yin Old Ancestor, using the pillar's power and secret techniques, divided and sealed it within the ten banners.

The Ten Directions Yama Banners aren't demonic evil artifacts but rather fire-controlling instruments.

Each banner contains a portion of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's power.  Thus, combinations of three, six, or ten banners create arrays of escalating power.

However, even with all ten banners, only a portion of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's power can be unleashed.

Even this partial power can rival a top-grade magical treasure, showcasing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's immense strength.


The name "Nine Netherworld Demon Fire" was given by Kuiyin Old Ancestor himself.  Even to this day, the Kuiyin Sect doesn't know its true name.

Extensive searches through ancient texts have yielded no record of this type of demonic fire.  Kuiyin Old Ancestor never found another flame like it anywhere else.

Because of this, even though Kuiyin Old Ancestor was alive, he couldn't complete the Ten Directions Yama Banner after half of it was destroyed. Yi Tiannie and the others weren't even Yuan Ying cultivators, making it impossible for them to find the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.

Without the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, it was impossible to complete the banner, even if Kuiyin Old Ancestor later managed to retrieve the other half of the Xuan Tie pillar.  It was a case of having the materials but lacking the essential component.

Learning this, Qin Sang abandoned the idea of forging a complete Ten Directions Yama Banner.

Without the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, it was simply impossible.  Kuiyin Old Ancestor had entered the Ziwei Palace numerous times, only finding this single flame.

However, repairing the other two banner sections still resulted in something comparable to a mid-grade magic treasure, which greatly excited Qin Sang.

This meant that while cultivators of his level were still struggling with low-grade magic treasures, he would possess a mid-grade one immediately after forming his Golden Core.

It's worth noting that even among mid-Golden Core cultivators, only a few possessed mid-grade magic treasures.

Coupled with his rapidly evolving Sky-Flying Night Rakshasa, Qin Sang felt confident facing mid-Golden Core opponents without fear, and even capable of crushing those at his own cultivation level.

Lost in these thoughts, Qin Sang lovingly played with the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.

A rich, strange fragrance filled the air. The cloud-like filaments on the fruit's surface seemed to move, a truly wondrous sight, sending waves of coolness through his fingertips.

"Senior, you must have been bluffing Yi Tiannie earlier, right?  I still need to consume this fruit to restore my foundation?"

Yunyouzi nodded gently. "While the Three Lights Jade Liquid is extraordinary, it's only reputed as a healing medicine. I wasn't sure if it could restore your foundation, so consuming the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit is a more reliable method. However, regardless of its effectiveness, we couldn't continue to be threatened by him. Thankfully, I still had enough energy to retrieve the fruit for you."

"You're right, Senior..."

Qin Sang nodded in agreement. He too had decided to abandon the idea of using the fruit to kill Yi Tiannie, aligning perfectly with Yunyouzi's plan. "Thank you for your assistance, Senior. I finally achieved my goal. Senior, how are you feeling now?"

Yunyouzi examined himself and shook his head. "I'm afraid I'll still be weak for a while before I recover. Once we leave the Ancient Medicine Garden, I'll have to trouble Brother Qin with breaking the restriction alone."
