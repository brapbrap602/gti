<h1>Chapter 1778: Fusion</h1><p>*啪!*</p><p>His anti-venom treasures shattered one after another.</p><p>The dark river was like a bottomless pit.</p><p>Not only were the undercurrents surging, but the earth seemed to be shaking violently—a great change was about to occur here!</p><p>Qin Sang had no time for anything else.  He and Bai, working together, were still unable to escape.  In this situation, their only hope rested with Fei Can and the anti-venom armor.</p><p>Bai returned to the corpse puppet bag, lightening Fei Can's burden. Qin Sang shielded Fei Can to his chest, letting himself be tossed around by the suction force deep underground.</p><p>Fei Can fought with all its might, using all its strength.</p><p>Qin Sang transferred the unrefined power of the San Guang Jade Liquid to Fei Can.</p><p>But the anti-venom armor was still teetering on the brink of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The deeper they went into the dark river, the more intense the poison became. It wasn't just a matter of rapid consumption; Fei Can's innate ability had reached its limit, unable to withstand the poisonous erosion.</p><p>Fei Can was, after all, only in the mid-third transformation stage; its abilities had inherent limitations.</p><p>It wasn't Qin Sang's spirit insect; he couldn't use any of his various Wu tribe secret techniques on Fei Can, unlike the Tian Mu Butterfly which could provide assistance.</p><p>Fei Can was overexerting itself, whimpering, clearly about to give out.</p><p>At that moment, Bai's anxious voice suddenly came from the corpse puppet bag, "Quickly! Release your little sweetheart!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He opened the corpse puppet bag and embraced Ya Gu.</p><p>Ya Gu's eyes were closed, still like a sleeping beauty, but her spirit faintly conveyed a restless emotion, as if she wanted to tell Qin Sang something, but couldn't speak.</p><p>The San Guang Jade Liquid provided vitality, preserving her body from decay.</p><p>Previously, warm jade had nurtured her spirit.</p><p>After receiving a piece of soul-nurturing wood from Bai, Qin Sang placed a soul-nurturing wood tablet on Ya Gu, far more effective than the warm jade.</p><p>As time went on...</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had felt Ya Gu's condition improving.</p><p>Although she still hadn't awakened, Fei Can's intelligence had increased.  Each movement it made showed more affection and trust towards Qin Sang than before, even a kind of filial piety.</p><p>There's a mysterious connection between a master and their spirit insect.</p><p>For Ya Gu, Fei Can was her anchor in the real world.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Fei Can was likely being influenced by Ya Gu. Thanks to the soul-nurturing wood, Ya Gu's consciousness, instead of sinking, had become increasingly stable.</p><p>Ya Gu appeared, Fei Can let out a whimper, its body leaping to Ya Gu's brow.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop it.</p><p>A shimmering, seven-colored light flashed, and Fei Can actually merged into Ya Gu's body.</p><p>Without any visible movement from Ya Gu, a ball of seven-colored light suddenly burst from her body and merged into the anti-venom armor.</p><p>The anti-venom armor, which had been on the verge of collapse, suddenly stabilized, blocking the poison!</p><p>Fei Can had voluntarily submitted to Ya Gu as its master.</p><p>It's said that in the Wu tribe's insect-gu arts, this is the best way for a spirit insect to submit—even better than a lifebound insect.  Not only does it bring about extreme harmony between cultivator and insect, it also provides unexpected benefits.</p><p>Such an opportunity is rare and unpredictable.</p><p>Like humans, the Wu tribe has lost many secrets. Even Wu tribe cultivators today don't know how to make a spirit insect voluntarily submit, nor what benefits it might bring.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Qin Sang felt both joy and worry.</p><p>He was happy because Ya Gu and Fei Can had merged, likely due to Fei Can's voluntary submission, meaning they no longer needed to worry about dying in the poison pool.</p><p>He was worried because Ya Gu's cultivation was too weak. When she was nearly killed after being implicated by him, she was only at the Qi Condensation stage. What kind of impact would this have on her?</p><p>*呼呼……*</p><p>The aura of light continued to flash.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed. His premonition was coming true; Ya Gu's face turned pale and bloodless, her breath weakening rapidly. Her spirit was more fragile than before, like a flickering candle in the wind.</p><p>But she persisted, relentlessly expending everything she had, fighting alongside Fei Can!</p><p>"Vitality…"</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely anxious, continuously transferring the remaining medicinal power to Ya Gu, but to little effect. He knew too little about the Wu tribe, not even understanding what Ya Gu and Fei Can were expending—something more fundamental than vitality, perhaps.</p><p>"Soul Cleansing Liquid!"</p><p>Bai called out a reminder.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had thought of it too. The Soul Cleansing Liquid was not only an aid in forming the Nascent Soul, but it also brought abundant spiritual power to cultivators, and it might work.</p><p>With their lives on the line, there was no room for stinginess.</p><p>Qin Sang produced a vial of Soul-Washing Liquid and gave it to Ya Gu.  The liquid, combined with the life force of the San Guang Jade Elixir, slowed Ya Gu's deterioration, but couldn't stop it entirely.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly crashed against the jagged rocks, his body screaming in pain. He didn't know how far the undercurrent had carried him.  He felt like he'd fallen into a giant whirlpool, a dizzying sensation overwhelming him.  He held Ya Gu close, then suddenly felt weightless, breaking free from the poisonous water. Before he could react, he slammed hard onto the ground.</p><p>...</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King and the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle discovered the ancient Dragon Tomb.  A sealed stone door guarded the entrance. The Jiao Dragon King studied it for a long time before discerning clues and attempting to break the seal. Using Jiao dragon blood as a conduit, he inscribed the Jiao clan's inherited seals onto the door.  He achieved resonance with the ancient Dragon Tomb, but it was weak, insufficient to open the door.</p><p>The poison here was too potent; the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle could barely hold on. They took turns resisting the poison, the Jiao Dragon King teaching the turtle his clan's secret techniques.  The two powerful beings exchanged knowledge, repeatedly adjusting their strategy and analyzing the ancient seal.</p><p>Finally, the resonance with the ancient Dragon Tomb grew stronger.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The stone door vibrated and a crack appeared.  Both rejoiced and darted inside.</p><p>Beyond the door was an ancient hall.  Though dark, it didn't impede their vision. Their eyes swept across the empty hall, until they landed on a crystal pillar standing at its center.</p><p>"It's a dragon corpse!"</p><p>The two powerful beings stared, speechless.  The Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle gasped, eyes greedy.  Inside the crystal pillar lay a skeleton, slender and long, encased in crystal. It was neither python nor Jiao dragon, but a true dragon!</p><p>Though its flesh had decayed, leaving only bone, the dragon corpse exuded an immense presence. Its head was held high, its aura awe-inspiring.  It was unknown how long the true dragon had lain here.  Standing before the skeletal remains, they still felt the dragon's overwhelming power, an urge to prostrate themselves.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle moved to approach, but the Jiao Dragon King stopped him.</p><p>"Careful of the seal's backlash!"</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, the Jiao Dragon King carefully observed.  He noticed intricate seals on the crystal. The dragon corpse was incomplete, with numerous damages—missing claws, even cracks on the skull.</p><p>"Most likely, this is a seal. In ancient times, the demon race probably used this dragon corpse as a vessel for the seal..."</p><p>They examined it thoroughly, unable to determine what was sealed within.  As time passed, the ancient Dragon Tomb weakened, the crystal pillar's luster dimmed, and the dragon corpse decayed.  Whatever was sealed inside was likely dead.  Even if something were released, they would take the dragon corpse and flee immediately; the cultivators would bear the brunt.</p>
