<h1>Chapter 822 The Demon Lord</h1><p>Chapter 822 The Demon Lord</p><p>Liangqiu Island.</p><p>The island’s appearance had drastically changed, now occupied by a massive flag formation.</p><p>Hundreds of enormous flags, each ten meters tall, materialized—some planted in the ground, others floating in the air. At the formation’s center, a circular array hung suspended, its size vastly inflated.</p><p>The flags shone with intense yellow light, all converging towards the array.</p><p>In the heart of Liangqiu Island, the yellow light soared into the sky, forming a gigantic cocoon of light.</p><p>On the cocoon’s surface, countless runes and miniature flag phantoms flickered incessantly, swirling with the cocoon. Inside, a tiny figure was trapped, desperately struggling against the light cocoon’s constraints.</p><p>Any observer witnessing the scene within the cocoon would be astonished, for it was a Nascent Soul cultivator.  His physical body was gone, destroyed by the killing array, leaving only his lone Nascent Soul attempting to teleport to escape.</p><p>However, the cocoon proved incredibly resilient. Not only did it remain unbroken, but it rapidly compressed inward, easily intercepting each of the Nascent Soul’s teleport attempts.</p><p>Powerless to stop it, the Nascent Soul watched in despair as the cocoon shrank, his expression one of utter hopelessness.</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>The Nascent Soul roared in fury, but his question remained unanswered.</p><p>Countless flag images converged on the Nascent Soul, seemingly imbued with a binding force, weakening his resistance until he was on the verge of being completely immobilized.</p><p>Meanwhile, two mysterious figures hovered on either side of the cocoon, pouring their full strength into manipulating the array.</p><p>One of them, clad in gray robes, seemed to sense something and glanced towards the distance, but without pausing his work, he continued to focus on controlling the flag formation, trapping his prey.</p><p>The formation’s power was immense. Working together, the two easily subdued the Nascent Soul.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Finally, the array shattered, dissolving into a shower of yellow light.</p><p>The light cocoon shrank to a tiny size, and the Nascent Soul within fell completely silent. A powerful Nascent Soul cultivator had been captured alive.</p><p>The gray-robed figure flicked his sleeve, drawing the cocoon into it. He then surveyed the area, ensuring no trace of the array’s destruction remained.</p><p>At that moment, his companion flew closer.</p><p>“It went rather smoothly. We’ve finally captured Yin Lao Mo. We should retreat. Those old ghosts have probably already received news and are heading here. If we don’t leave now, it’ll be too late.”</p><p>The black-robed figure looked around. “Where’s your soul servant?”</p><p>“Dead.”</p><p>The gray-robed figure gazed towards the direction of the woman's demise, stating calmly, “She was killed in return.”</p><p>The black-robed figure exclaimed in astonishment, “Dead? By only one person?  Creating those two soul servants cost you a significant amount of effort. Even when we were both in the late Core Formation stage, while we might have been able to defeat them, killing them outright would have been nearly impossible… We’ve really stirred up a hornet’s nest!”</p><p>“Even a hornet’s nest is just a Core Formation junior…”</p><p>A hint of anger tinged the gray-robed figure’s tone as he transformed into a streak of light, speeding away.</p><p>Soon, the two appeared where the woman had fallen.</p><p>The sea surface was empty, the perpetrator having vanished without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang, having eliminated the soul body, immediately fled.</p><p>After taking a circuitous route and hiding for a day, Qin Sang, certain that no pursuers remained, began flying towards Qu Heng Island to gather information.</p><p>On his way, he sensed something amiss.  The islands along his route had activated their protective arrays, and the cultivators he encountered were rushing about.</p><p>Qin Sang started inquiring, intercepting a Core Formation cultivator and learning about the recent events.</p><p>“The island master of Yin Bamboo Island is dead.  They say it happened two nights ago, when a mysterious expert attacked him in plain sight.  A Nascent Soul cultivator, his fate and whereabouts remain unknown.  And it wasn't just the island master; some Core Formation cultivators nearby were also caught in the crossfire and perished, resulting in heavy losses.  The culprits’ audacity infuriated the two island masters of Qu Heng Island, who have ordered a thorough investigation.  Major forces from both righteous and demonic paths in the Liefeng Archipelago have been mobilized, arresting many cultivators of unknown origins.  Right now, everyone’s scared.  If you don't have any business, it's best not to wander around.  Just like me, quickly return to your cave and stay put until this storm passes, lest you cause a misunderstanding.”</p><p>The cultivator didn’t hide anything, detailing his observations.</p><p>“Yin Bamboo Island? I remember that island master was a demonic cultivator. Was it revenge?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, surprised. He had assumed Luo Daotong was backed by one of the two Qu Heng Island masters.  He recalled that Yin Bamboo Island was a large, well-known island nearby, and its master was indeed a demonic cultivator.</p><p>"That's beyond my knowledge. After all, he's a powerful figure in the demonic cultivation world.  How could he not have many enemies? Many cultivators suspect this as well..."</p><p>The man lowered his voice, speaking mysteriously, "There are rumors on Qu Heng Island that the island master's identity is not simple.  He's no ordinary Yuan Ying cultivator; he has close ties to the Demon Lord. That's why the two island masters were so panicked and worked so hard—they were afraid of the Demon Lord's punishment. If the Demon Lord is angered, hundreds of thousands could die, and the complete annihilation of the Lie Feng Islands wouldn't be surprising! Wherever those murderers hide, they'll be found. The cultivation world is in for a period of turmoil..."</p><p>The man shook his head as he spoke and bid Qin Sang farewell.</p><p>Qin Sang watched him leave.</p><p>"It's the Demon Lord!"</p><p>A chill ran down his spine.</p><p>The demonic cultivation world wasn't a monolith.  But the Demon Lord, as the most powerful cultivator among them, undoubtedly led the strongest faction. Who else could command the Yin Zhu Island master and gather several Yuan Ying cultivators?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood why Elder Qing Zhu had been so cautious, concealing his identity and hiding in a remote corner for two hundred years.</p><p>His enemy was the Demon Lord!</p><p>This was undoubtedly a hopeless opponent.</p><p>No matter how talented Elder Qing Zhu was, he couldn't possibly have the strength to confront the Demon Lord in just two hundred years.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled being almost killed by the aftershock of the battle between the Demon Lord and the Great Witch Doctor in the Sky Tower. He was even more hopeless than Elder Qing Zhu; he didn't even qualify to stand before the Demon Lord.</p><p>"Finally, I've found out the identity of the opponent, and I know who to guard against...but this enemy is too terrifying, one of the great cultivators standing at the peak of the Cang Lang Sea. How can I defend against him?  Besides hiding, there's nothing I can do. I hope Elder Qing Zhu didn't offend the Demon Lord because of the teleportation array..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>At the same time, he was also puzzled by the events of the past few days.  The other party was targeting Luo Dao Tong and the Yin Zhu Island master, just like him, at the same time. Was it simply a coincidence, or was it just a matter of revenge against the Yin Zhu Island master?</p><p>The situation was unclear, but he lacked the ability to find the main culprit and solve the mystery.</p><p>"Forget it, although I haven't met Elder Qing Zhu in person, it's not a complete waste of time. Since the other party dared to attack someone connected to the Demon Lord, they must be prepared. This storm won't subside easily. It's time to leave to avoid being implicated. I've been away long enough. It's time to go back to Tian Xing Island; there's still much to do."</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind and immediately left the Lie Feng Islands.  His origins were unclear; if he were caught, he might be mistaken for an accomplice to the murderers, which would be incredibly unjust.</p><p>He changed direction and flew towards the outside of the Lie Feng Islands.</p>
