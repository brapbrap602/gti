<h1>Chapter 361 Song Yi</h1><p>Chapter 361 Song Yi</p><p>The Earth-Sinking Cave.</p><p>The disciple guarding the Earth-Sinking Cave was cultivating in his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived unseen, found the previous crack, and landed on the stone platform.</p><p>He first took out the Shao Yin magnetic bottle, filled it with earth-sha spirit energy, then waved his hand, setting up a concealment array and summoning the two corpse puppets.</p><p>Only one final step remained: refining the earth-sha energy into their bodies to complete the process.</p><p>However, this step was also the most difficult, and Qin Sang was uncertain about success.</p><p>If the refinement failed, the corpse puppets' energy seas would be destroyed, leaving only corpses, a terrible waste of a Sky Corpse Talisman and a Foundation Establishment cultivator's body.</p><p>It would have been better to simply kill them and make them into earth-sha corpses.</p><p>The *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual's* corpse refinement methods are indeed powerful, but the cost is also enormous.  Not only are the materials rare and difficult to find, but every step is fraught with uncertainty. No wonder the disciples of the Sky Corpse Sect cannot each possess a living corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang had mentally rehearsed the process countless times. After checking the corpses, he prepared to begin.</p><p>Having two corpse puppets allowed for a degree of error.</p><p>The younger cultivator, dressed in fine clothes, was a level weaker than Liang Yan, so Qin Sang started with him.</p><p>He channeled his spiritual energy, captured a stream of earth-sha spirit energy, subdued it, and injected it into the corpse puppet's energy sea.  Immediately, the corpse puppet's internal spiritual energy fiercely resisted.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, Qin Sang emerged from the Earth-Sinking Cave, his expression somewhat gloomy.</p><p>His bad mood was understandable. Of the two living corpses, only one had been successfully refined—fortunately, the stronger one, Liang Yan.</p><p>As for the youth in fine clothes, his dantian was completely destroyed during the clash of spiritual energy and earth-sha spirit energy, leaving Qin Sang to only turn him into a mindless zombie for cannon fodder.</p><p>Liang Yan's energy sea had also suffered significant damage, nearly resulting in failure, but Qin Sang managed to salvage the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back at the Earth-Sinking Cave.  He left the corpses inside to bathe in the earth-sha spirit energy, allowing them to recover on their own.</p><p>Two of his three most important tasks were complete. The last was to check the Purple Micro Palace's library in the sect to see if it held any relevant texts.  This was located on Treasure Pagoda Peak.</p><p>The remaining matters were minor and could wait. He would meet with Yunyouzi at Broken Cliff Mountain at the agreed time.</p><p>He rode his Youluo Cloud towards Xianglong Mountain in Gu Yuan Kingdom.  His ostensibly public cave dwelling was located at Returning Dragon View. If others needed to contact him, they would leave message talismans there.</p><p>After disabling the restrictions on Returning Dragon View, Qin Sang found a considerable accumulation of message talismans.  Talismans of various colors were trapped within the formation, drifting like mayflies, countless specks of light.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently collected and examined each one.</p><p>Some were routine sect announcements, while others were from passing cultivators who, noticing the spiritual formation around Returning Dragon View, left messages hoping to make his acquaintance.</p><p>Several were from acquaintances, such as Shopkeeper Wu, Senior Brother Wen, and Zhuang Yan.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, one was from Old Woman Jing—the senior cultivator who ran the secret shop in Moonlit Market—inviting him to assist her, offering a generous reward.</p><p>This wasn't a task posted by another member of the secret shop, but a personal request from Old Woman Jing.</p><p>The timing coincided with his departure for the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, making it impossible for him to respond.</p><p>Holding the message talisman, Qin Sang fell into thought.</p><p>From their first meeting, Old Woman Jing had given Qin Sang a sense of impenetrable mystery, an impression only deepened by their subsequent encounters, particularly given her strict adherence to the shop's rules, which Qin Sang found very commendable.</p><p>The secret shop’s members included many Foundation Establishment cultivators, making it a valuable connection.</p><p>Cultivating a good relationship with Old Woman Jing could only be beneficial.</p><p>He hadn’t known about the message talisman before. Now that he was back, it was best to personally explain the delay—it wouldn't take much time.</p><p>Ninety percent of the talismans proved useless.  After spending an hour at Returning Dragon View organizing them, Qin Sang set off towards Mount Shao Hua.</p><p>…</p><p>Moonlit Market.</p><p>Decades had passed, yet the market remained virtually unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang walked through the streets towards Shopkeeper Wu's shop.  Several flying talismans from Shopkeeper Wu were among those he found at Returning Dragon View, almost annually for the past several years, the most recent just two months ago.</p><p>While the message talismans contained only greetings, the frequency suggested Shopkeeper Wu might be facing some difficulties.</p><p>As Qin Sang intended to ask Shopkeeper Wu to help refine some magical artifacts, he went directly there.  If Shopkeeper Wu's problems weren't serious, he would help if he could.</p><p>The shop was still in its original location. Qin Sang paused, glancing at the ‘Li Mansion’ opposite before entering the shop.</p><p>“Welcome, Senior! Are you here to purchase or commission the refinement of magical artifacts?”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu wasn't there. Only an eighteen or nineteen-year-old boy was present, who greeted Qin Sang enthusiastically, offering tea and a seat; he was quite lively.</p><p>A young man, also a cultivator, was in the shop.  Qin Sang, after observing the youth's appearance, took a sip of tea and asked, "Is Daoist Wu not in the shop?"</p><p>The young man exclaimed, "So you know my master?  Master is refining artifacts in the backyard. I'll go get him."</p><p>Master?</p><p>Qin Sang watched the young man leave, a playful smile on his lips.</p><p>Shortly after the youth departed, hurried footsteps sounded from the backyard.</p><p>Then, the shop owner, Daoist Wu, his hair now silver, quickly emerged, the young man trotting behind him.</p><p>"Daoist Qin!  After more than thirty years, I hope you are well!"  Daoist Wu hastened to Qin Sang, his expression and voice filled with excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang rose to greet him, returning the bow, "Daoist Wu, I am well."</p><p>When Qin Sang had last left Mount Shao Hua, Daoist Wu was a middle-aged man in his prime. Now, his youthful dark hair had turned completely white.  Daoist Wu had not achieved the Foundation Establishment stage, and the passage of time was evident on him.</p><p>"You remain unchanged, but I am now quite old! Shameful! Shameful!" Daoist Wu nearly covered his face, sighing deeply.</p><p>They sat and talked for a while. The young man stood by, quietly observing Qin Sang.  His youthful nature betrayed his curiosity and expectation.</p><p>After finishing a pot of tea, Qin Sang set down his cup, turning his gaze to the young man who had been serving tea.  Kindly, he asked, "What is your name?"</p><p>The young man looked at Daoist Wu, who smiled without answering.</p><p>"My name is Song Yi," the youth replied respectfully.</p><p>"Song Yi…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, then asked, "What is your relationship to Song Ying and Song Chengxian?"</p><p>Upon entering the shop and seeing the young man, Qin Sang had noticed a familiar look in his eyes.  He was handsome and refined, resembling Song Hua and his sister Song Ying. Song Chengxian, Song Ying's son, had achieved Foundation Establishment.  Qin Sang, fulfilling a prior promise, had visited the Song family and, while not taking Song Chengxian as a disciple, had given him a Foundation Establishment pill as a token of gratitude.</p><p>"Song Ying is my maternal grandmother, and Song Chengxian is my maternal uncle," Song Yi replied.</p>
