<h1>Chapter 407: A Lesson Learned</h1><p>Chapter 407: A Lesson Learned</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The terrifying collision shook the entire cave.</p><p>Qin Sang almost lost his footing from the shockwave.</p><p>Blinding silver light filled the cave, creating a hazy white void.  Nothing was visible.</p><p>When the light finally dimmed,</p><p>the Nine Nether Demon Flame had vanished.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Formation lay in ruins, several ghost banners scattered on the ground. Fortunately, they weren't the target of the thunderballs, and Qin Sang, seeing the danger, wisely retracted his main soul, escaping harm.</p><p>But his magic weapon seemed to have fared poorly.  A large banner lay on the ground, its spiritual light dim, its power diminished.</p><p>The banner’s surface was slightly rolled, revealing a faint crack.</p><p>Fatty Chicken escaped.</p><p>Its feathers were singed and patchy, turning it into a bald, black chicken, though it remained just as fat, particularly its meaty wings and plump belly, quite succulent.</p><p>Despite its miserable appearance, Fatty Chicken’s injuries were not serious. It could still flap its wings, its two fat legs kicking at the air.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Flame hadn't harmed it, but the thunderball had struck his magic weapon, causing the flame to dissipate.</p><p>Enraged and regaining its composure, it opened its beak to shriek. Its beak was also burned bald and black, the sound hoarse and unpleasant.</p><p>However, the shriek abruptly stopped, swallowed mid-cry.</p><p>A black miasma enveloped Fatty Chicken. Its wings stiffened, and it ‘thumped’ to the ground, bouncing slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang, seizing the opportunity, destroyed his high-grade magic artifact, releasing all the poisonous miasma from the Sky Poison Shawl, buying himself even a fraction of a second.</p><p>He was startled by the thunderball’s explosive power, especially after seeing the crack on his magic weapon. His heart pounded with fear, worrying about its condition.</p><p>Even using a magic weapon, he had barely managed it.</p><p>Without the magic weapon's assistance, he would never have had the chance to ambush Fatty Chicken.</p><p>Despite these chaotic thoughts, Qin Sang moved swiftly and smoothly, releasing the poisonous miasma to ambush Fatty Chicken while simultaneously summoning his dragon form, his figure like lightning as he dashed towards the jade pool.</p><p>Landing at the pool’s edge, Qin Sang secretly rejoiced that the thunderball didn't automatically attack.</p><p>He then leaped into the pool, reaching into the spiritual spring to grasp the Intervening Blood Mulberry.</p><p>As his hand touched the sacred wood,</p><p>a bloody light emanated from it, like a living thing, spreading along Qin Sang's arm towards his body.  He shuddered, immediately feeling an indescribable chill and a wave of foulness assaulting his spirit, which was quickly dispelled by his jade Buddha amulet.</p><p>Truly one of the Ten Divine Woods, it was incredibly wondrous.</p><p>Without time to examine it further, Qin Sang tossed the Intervening Blood Mulberry into his dimensional pouch, a huge weight lifting off his chest.  Just as he was about to retreat, he glanced up and spotted a stone door behind the jade pool.</p><p>A secret chamber!  More secrets within!</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang pondered.  He had initially wondered why a cave containing only a Thunder Hawk egg, an Intervening Blood Mulberry, and an unknown herb – however valuable – would warrant such a fierce struggle between two Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Could the real treasure be in the secret chamber?</p><p>The thought crossed his mind, but he wasn't consumed by greed. Obtaining the Intervening Blood Mulberry was already an incredible stroke of luck; he'd already invested everything for it.</p><p>With the Sky Poison Shawl destroyed, and its miasma uncontrolled, it wouldn’t hold Fatty Chicken for long.</p><p>Once Fatty Chicken awoke…</p><p>The consequences of his greed would be dire.</p><p>Qin Sang turned away, activating his Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman and fleeing towards the cave entrance.</p><p>Passing Fatty Chicken, Qin Sang collected his scattered artifacts and magic weapons, hastily checking the magic weapon’s condition and sighing inwardly.</p><p>He hadn’t been mistaken; there was indeed a crack on the banner!</p><p>The only fortunate aspect was that the damage wasn't severe. The thunderball's power wasn't as terrifying as he’d imagined, not capable of destroying the magic weapon.</p><p>The damage occurred because Qin Sang's cultivation base was too weak, making the magic weapon underutilized and causing it to suffer damage from the direct thunder strike.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator could simply store the magic weapon in their energy sea and nurture it with their inner fire for a short time to restore it completely.</p><p>Sadly, Qin Sang's cultivation was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.  Before reaching the Core Formation stage, he was unable to repair his magic treasures and couldn't ask other Core Formation cultivators for help, so he could only put them away.</p><p>Fortunately, he had two Ten Directions Yama Banners, powerful magic treasures. Since he couldn't use both at once anyway, the destruction of one didn't significantly weaken him.</p><p>In short, trading a top-grade magic artifact and a damaged magic treasure for a Nether Blood Mulberry was, in Qin Sang's opinion, a worthwhile, even extremely profitable exchange.</p><p>Thinking of the Nether Blood Mulberry and the bright future of the Ebony Sword, Qin Sang's frustration vanished, and his mood improved considerably.</p><p>The cave entrance was right before him. Hearing the angry squawks of Fatty Chicken behind him, Qin Sang felt a mischievous glint in his eye, and a playful mood came over him. He turned and shouted, "Little Fatty Chicken! Little Black Fatty Chicken! Grandpa's teaching you a lesson: the world is dangerous, it's best to have plenty of magic treasures for protection! Magic treasures are the best! Haha…"</p><p>I don't know how the age of a demon beast is calculated.</p><p>Fatty Chicken had just hatched from its egg; it was essentially an infant, while Qin Sang was seventy-plus. Calling it his grandchild wouldn't be an exaggeration.</p><p>Fatty Chicken seemed to understand, its cries becoming even sharper.</p><p>A strong gust of wind came from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed as he dashed out of the cave entrance into the biting wind.</p><p>Looking back, as expected, Fatty Chicken's bloodline ability was thunder control.  Despite its high cultivation, it still feared the terrifying chill of the Xuan Frost killing wind, which could assault the soul.</p><p>Inside the cave, it had been safe thanks to the underground earth vein that blocked the icy wind.</p><p>At the cave entrance, Fatty Chicken dared not cross the line, flapping its fleshy wings and hopping about, its large, mostly white eyes filled with anger, squawking incessantly.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the Fatty Chicken was cursing him, but since he didn't understand bird language, he figured it was cursing itself.</p><p>Once inside the deeper cave, the smile on Qin Sang's face instantly disappeared, replaced by a serious expression.</p><p>The Nether Blood Mulberry was in hand, but it wasn't time to celebrate yet.  Escaping safely was the priority.</p><p>He wondered how the battle between the Yuan Ying stage cultivators was going, hoping there wouldn't be any major changes.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped his Crimson Pill tightly and swiftly ascended.</p><p>Soon he reached the exit.  Slowing down, he held his breath, cautiously peering out of the cave entrance toward the distant horizon.</p><p>The wind sea surged.</p><p>The battle between the three powerful cultivators wasn't over. Qin Sang couldn't see the Sect Master of the Wuji Sect or the Thunder Swallowing Falcon; he only saw streaks of dragon-like sword light clashing with thunder.</p><p>The man in black remained seated cross-legged.  Dozens of identical Xuan Turtle armors had materialized around him, arranged in a mysterious formation according to some arcane pattern.</p><p>The formation had a small gap; several Xuan Turtle armors were missing.</p><p>With all ninety-nine eighty-one Xuan Turtle armors assembled, the formation would be complete!</p>
