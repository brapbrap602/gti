<h1>Chapter 1909: Paying a Visit</h1><p>Qin Sang and Xiao Wu entered the inn. Zhu Que flew to Qin Sang's shoulder and followed them inside.</p><p>The waiter, seeing Zhu Que, hesitated for a moment but didn't stop them. He gave a signal to the serving girl to keep a close watch.</p><p>Zhu Que wasn't as eye-catching as the Spirit Horse. As long as it didn't disturb other guests, it was permissible.</p><p>Qin Sang led Xiao Wu to a table by the window in the main hall.</p><p>"Snow Jade Nectar is our signature drink. It's a divine elixir meticulously brewed from Nine-Colored Lotuses that grow in the Coldfire Pool. It's renowned throughout Four Fires Town.  The Coldfire Pool is a rare cold spring within the Fire Domain, perpetually covered in ice and snow. Surrounding it is a sea of magma, yet the ice and snow never melt.  Not only is the scenery unique, but the extreme cold and extreme heat have fostered unique life within the pool, creating a distinct flavor. You must try it…"</p><p>"This Dragon's Pearl dish uses Silver Dragonfish raised in the Coldfire Pool. The pearl is carved from the crest jewel of a rare spirit beast, the Youli Bird…"</p><p>The serving girl introduced the dishes one by one.</p><p>Qin Sang listened with great interest, while Zhu Que was already smacking its beak.</p><p>Xiao Wu also tilted her head, listening intently, but she didn't understand everything.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the serving girl to explain in more detail.</p><p>Only after the serving girl had talked herself hoarse did Qin Sang wave his hand to interrupt.</p><p>"The three-hundred-year-old Silver Dragonfish and such, let's skip those. They're too expensive.  Young lady, your eloquence is truly captivating. From your description, even the less extravagant dishes sound like rare delicacies that make one's mouth water. Let's have one of each. Oh, and three pots of Snow Jade Nectar as well."</p><p>"Please wait a moment, honored guest."</p><p>The serving girl's smile remained as she bowed and retreated. Soon, a waiter brought the Snow Jade Nectar, and the dishes were served one after another.</p><p>A pure jade pot held the Snow Jade Nectar, a light azure, like a clear sky.</p><p>Even through the jade pot, Qin Sang could sense the abundant spiritual energy. It seemed the serving girl hadn't exaggerated.</p><p>Qin Sang poured a cup.</p><p>The Snow Jade Nectar tasted sweet and refreshing upon entry, followed by a cool sensation that flowed down his throat and into his belly. Finally, it burst like a ball of fire in his stomach, yet the power was remarkably gentle, something even a Qi Refining stage cultivator could withstand and benefit from.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in approval and poured a small cup for Xiao Wu. "Xiao Wu, try some."</p><p>As for Zhu Que, he didn't need to worry. It had already pulled out the stopper of the jade pot and was gulping down a whole pot.</p><p>Xiao Wu sipped the Snow Jade Nectar, her expression unchanged, as if it were ordinary water.</p><p>Qin Sang picked out some dishes for Xiao Wu, each with a different flavor.</p><p>"Food has five flavors: pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. Life is the same.  It's probably too difficult for you to understand the bitterness of life now, so you can start with these flavors. Try to savor them carefully…"</p><p>Xiao Wu imitated Qin Sang, picking up her chopsticks and picking up a snow-white petal. She chewed gently, her brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>It was a Moon Zenith flower, bitter in taste, with medicinal properties, yet it had a unique flavor when prepared as a dish.</p><p>Having tasted the Snow Jade Nectar first, then the Moon Zenith flower, Xiao Wu clearly noticed the difference.</p><p>Zhu Que gloated, tumbling with laughter on Qin Sang's shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang also smiled.</p><p>As Xiao Wu sampled each dish, her expressions gradually became more varied, though subtly.</p><p>"Which one do you like best?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Xiao Wu thought for a moment and pointed at the Snow Jade Nectar and two plates of pastries.</p><p>"All sweets, just as expected of a child," Qin Sang chuckled, shaking his head, and urged Xiao Wu to eat heartily.</p><p>Any later, Zhu Que would have devoured everything.</p><p>Third-floor private room.</p><p>The dancing girls had all been sent away.</p><p>On one side, men were boisterously drinking and making merry.</p><p>On the other, the shrewd man and the burly man called Second Brother had switched to clear tea and were silently sipping it.</p><p>Suddenly, the door was pushed open from the outside. A man slipped in, leaned close to the two, and whispered a few words, finally sneering, "We've checked them out. They can't even afford the Silver Dragonfish. They're nobodies."</p><p>"They can afford two spirit beasts, so they must have some wealth," the shrewd man mused.</p><p>"That Azure Horse is really something," the man chuckled.</p><p>"Let's do it!"</p><p>Second Brother slammed the table. "Seventh, this mission is important. We'll strike outside the town. I'll give you five brothers. Be quick and clean. Don't cause any trouble for Master Yin."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>…</p><p>Having enjoyed the meal and strolled through the market,</p><p>Qin Sang played his part to the fullest, buying necessities for entering the Fire Domain from various shops, and slowly led his horse towards the north gate.</p><p>Out of the town, Qin Sang summoned a spiritual wind, lifting himself and the horse, and soared into the sky.</p><p>The scenery gradually became desolate, with a red glow appearing on the northern horizon.</p><p>As they flew over a deserted hill, Qin Sang had a premonition and abruptly stopped the spiritual wind, landing on the hilltop.</p><p>Luo Hou also played along well, pawing the ground restlessly.</p><p>Only Zhu Que could barely contain its excitement, though fortunately, no one would pay particular attention to this unremarkable fire crow.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Just as Qin Sang landed, the surrounding sand exploded, revealing six figures. All were clad in black robes and masks, surrounding them.</p><p>"Huh, this Daoist's spiritual sense is quite keen," one of them said in surprise.</p><p>Even through the mask, Qin Sang recognized him as the shrewd man from the third floor of the Gathering Immortals Inn.</p><p>"This humble Daoist has just arrived and was on his way to the Fire Domain to gather herbs. I've made no enemies.  Friends, why do you block my path? If I have inadvertently trespassed upon your territory, I apologize and will leave at once."</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands.</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>The men burst into laughter.</p><p>They had already set up a formation around the area and felt confident.</p><p>"Daoist, you seem experienced.  Don't you understand the rules? Hand over your storage pouches and be cooperative. We brothers only want your wealth, not your life," the shrewd man said in a seemingly friendly tone.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang's composure made him inexplicably uneasy.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly replied, "Only wealth, not life? If you can adhere to this principle, we might be able to negotiate."</p><p>"Seventh Brother."</p><p>One of the men, who had been staring at Xiao Wu since their appearance, suddenly interrupted, "Remember how Old Granny Hong asked us to find infants for her?  Big Brother sent her so many before, but few met her requirements. She still needs two.  This little girl looks quite spirited.  Although she's blind, Old Granny Hong might take a liking to her."</p><p>He then let out a sinister chuckle. "Daoist, if your daughter is chosen by Old Granny Hong, you'll be set for life.  Don't forget about us brothers then!"</p><p>"Is Old Granny Hong some powerful figure? And what are the infants for?"</p><p>Qin Sang turned to the man, seemingly intrigued, a glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>"You haven't even heard of Old Granny Hong? You really are from elsewhere.  Old Granny Hong is a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, an elder of the Frost Snow Palace.  She cultivates the formidable Seven Blood Nascent Soul Art…"</p><p>The man, now enthusiastic, revealed the details of the Frost Snow Palace and Old Granny Hong.</p><p>"Tenth!"</p><p>The shrewd man barked, trying to interrupt him.</p><p>But the man ignored him, continuing to talk incessantly.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A whip lashed out, striking the man hard.</p><p>His black robe, which was a magical garment, tore open.  He was sent flying, tumbling across the ground like a gourd, still babbling even as he lay there.</p><p>"If your daughter becomes Old Granny Hong's infant attendant, she'll be the closest person to her. Even if Old Granny Hong gifts her to another powerful figure later as a concubine, you'll at least get to be a father-in-law, hehe…"</p><p>The man rambled on, as if possessed.</p><p>His familiar laughter, usually jovial, now sounded like the wail of a vengeful ghost to the shrewd man and the others. A bone-chilling fear gripped them.</p><p>At this point, if they still didn't realize something was wrong with their prey, their years of roaming would have been for naught.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>They retreated rapidly. The shrewd man cupped his hands and said gravely, "We were blind, unable to recognize a superior cultivator.  Let's consider today's events a misunderstanding…"</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him, committing the Frost Snow Palace and Old Granny Hong to memory, murmuring, "Seven Blood Nascent Soul Art… sounds like a cultivation method for refining cauldrons and servants, not something righteous…"</p><p>He glanced at Xiao Wu, whose expression remained placid.</p><p>Xiao Wu didn't understand what it would mean for an ordinary girl to be taken as an infant attendant.</p><p>"It seems I'm still standing too 'high.' I need to move further south…"</p><p>Qin Sang even considered sending Xiao Wu to a mortal school to live a mortal life.</p><p>But before leaving, he needed to settle the matter at hand.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's fearless demeanor, the men's unease intensified.</p><p>Another one shouted, "Daoist, release Tenth Brother at once! If you dare harm us, you won't escape Four Fires Town! No matter how high your cultivation, how many can you fight?  Aren't you afraid of accidentally harming your daughter during the fight?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze. "Do you have backers in Four Fires Town?"</p><p>"The Yin and Gou families of Four Fires Town are close friends with our Big Brother. They have numerous experts and can easily mobilize half the town's forces to besiege you…"</p><p>The same scene replayed before the shrewd man. His previously aggressive companions were now babbling like lunatics.</p><p>And he still hadn't noticed Qin Sang making any moves, completely baffled by how he was doing it.</p><p>Unease transformed into terror.</p><p>The shrewd man secretly activated his movement technique, about to flee, but he met Qin Sang's eyes and heard a question, "What are your identities? Where did your accomplices go?"</p><p>He froze, all thoughts vanishing, replaced by an irresistible urge to answer.</p><p>"We brothers are the Northern Desert Thirteen Hawks. We accepted two commissions and passed through Four Fires Town. Big Brother is leading men west to kill Old Man Hong Xi of Red Wave Mountain.  Second Brother is leading men east to deliver several chests to the Zou family of Nest City. The chests are sealed with talismans. Big Brother forbade us from opening them, so we don't know what's inside…"</p><p>"So you are the infamous Northern Desert Thirteen Hawks. I've heard so much about you."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Times were turbulent, and bandits were rampant.</p><p>The Northern Desert Thirteen Hawks were among the most notorious, accepting contracts while continuing their banditry along the way.</p><p>"Watch them. I'll go capture the others."</p><p>Qin Sang said to Xiao Wu and Luo Hou.</p><p>Zhu Que, initially perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, finding too many rules around him, seized the opportunity to slip onto Luo Hou's back.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered. Suddenly, he heard a thud behind him. Turning back, he saw the bandits had all vanished.</p><p>Five-colored light flashed briefly in the void, emanating from Xiao Wu's delicate fingers.</p><p>Zhu Que zipped back to Qin Sang's side with all its might, its face filled with terror.</p><p>"Scared the bird witless! Scared the bird witless!"</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Luo Hou wanted to speak but stopped, its legs trembling, looking at Qin Sang with pleading eyes.</p><p>Xiao Wu, who had just casually obliterated several men, remained expressionless, her eyes closed, still appearing innocent and pure.</p><p>"Why did you kill them?" Qin Sang asked gently.</p><p>Xiao Wu replied earnestly, "They were trying to run."</p><p>Qin Sang had told her to watch the bandits. The bandits tried to escape, so she killed them.</p><p>Zhu Que shuddered.</p><p>It dared to be impudent with Qin Sang because it knew Qin Sang wouldn't harm it. But if one day Xiao Wu misinterpreted his instructions…</p><p>The consequences were unimaginable!</p><p>Qin Sang stroked Xiao Wu's hair. "From now on, unless I tell you to, you can only use the Righteous Five Elements Divine Light, alright?"</p><p>"Mm!"</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded obediently.</p><p>"A long road ahead…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, then thought of another issue.  "If one claims to uphold justice, one cannot abuse personal judgment. If Xiao Wu kills someone who doesn't deserve to die, shouldn't I seek justice for them?  There's no absolute fairness in this world. Different perspectives can invert good and evil. Even the Purple Star Emperor can't distinguish absolute good and evil. Besides, with the world in such chaos, can I truly kill everyone who deserves it? There must be something I haven't grasped yet…"</p><p>…</p><p>East of Four Fires Town.</p><p>A group was flying on a Grey-winged Giant Hawk when a sudden gust of wind easily shattered the hawk's protective demonic aura.</p><p>They tried to resist but were helpless, feeling disoriented as they crashed to the ground. They found their companions who had gone with Big Brother were now beside them.</p><p>"I once had a grudge against someone and slaughtered his entire clan, over a hundred innocent lives…"</p><p>"I can't remember how many people I've robbed and killed. Men were beheaded, women were drained of their vital yin…"</p><p>"I wouldn't drain their vital yin completely. I'd keep them alive to enjoy slowly, and trade them for new ones when I got tired of them, hehe…"</p><p>Amidst the wind and sand,</p><p>The bandits recounted their bloody deeds one by one, and as they spoke, their heads split in two, staining the yellow sand with blood.</p><p>In the end, two unexpectedly didn't deserve death, much to Qin Sang's surprise.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the town.</p><p>The Yin Family Estate.</p><p>The reception hall was brightly lit. A white-haired elder sat in the main seat.</p><p>Beside him sat a portly man with a gentle demeanor, holding a folding fan.</p><p>The two were discussing something.</p><p>Suddenly, the hall doors were pushed open, revealing two figures, one tall and one short.</p><p>The elder's expression shifted, his eyes turning sharp as a hawk. "Who dares be so impudent! Seize them!"</p><p>He had assumed it was some ignorant member of the household, but upon closer inspection, they were strangers.</p><p>Outside the door, it was silent, with no response.</p><p>The elder then remembered he had sealed the hall with a formation for his discussion with the Gu family head, and it had been silently broken.</p><p>"Hiss…"</p><p>A chill ran down the elder's spine. He slammed the table, about to stand, but was pinned down by a terrifying force.</p><p>"You must be the head of the Yin family… And who are you?"</p><p>Qin Sang led Xiao Wu into the hall.</p><p>The portly man tightened his grip on his folding fan, trying to maintain his composure. "This humble one is the head of the Gu family. May I ask who you are, friend?"</p><p>"The Gu family, the nominal rulers of Four Fires Town," Qin Sang acknowledged. "Is the Gu family also involved with the bandits?"</p><p>By now, the elder had regained his senses.  He said gravely, "Grudges are easily formed but difficult to resolve. May I ask where the Yin family has offended you, friend?  I am willing to make amends. My master is Elder Yu Daozi of Heavenly Beam Mountain. Perhaps you are acquainted with him."</p>
