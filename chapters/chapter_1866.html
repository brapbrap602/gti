<h1>Chapter 1857: Unexpected Event</h1><p>The golden light emanating from the Vajra Bodhi tree filled the bubble space, feeling like holding a golden orb.</p><p>A faint blue glow shimmered within the golden light, the radiance of the restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang was multitasking, using his escape technique, comprehending the restriction, and guarding against the spiritual tree suddenly becoming intangible.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the Heavenly Eye Butterfly assisting him; its heavenly eye ability could detect minute changes, giving him the courage to flee towards the valley exit.</p><p>However, to prevent sudden changes, he still needed to reserve some strength while escaping, lest his efforts be in vain.</p><p>"This restriction is very powerful…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, glancing back.</p><p>The oppressive force followed like a shadow, seemingly unable to catch him for now.  However, Qin Sang couldn't shake off the opponent's lock, and considering the opponent was a demon king, it was impossible to know its full capabilities.</p><p>Under these circumstances, there was no time to break the restriction properly.</p><p>After briefly analyzing the restriction's structure, he had to forcibly break it and leave this dangerous place as quickly as possible, hoping not to damage the spiritual tree.</p><p>After flying upward for a while, Qin Sang noticed that the blue light restriction showed signs of weakening, but far slower than expected.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the restriction's changes weren't solely location-dependent.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang didn't dare to directly take the bubble out of the valley. He had a strange feeling; while the blue light restriction hadn't weakened significantly, the golden light within the bubble seemed to be changing.</p><p>He wasn't sure if this change was a transition towards intangibility and dared not gamble.  His sense of urgency intensified.</p><p>Behind Qin Sang, invisible to the naked eye, the blue light waves were much dimmer than elsewhere.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>A faint sound of water, growing closer, black, ominous waves surged from the distance, spreading like a tide.  A black figure, a fish-headed dragon-bodied creature, was faintly visible within the expanding darkness.</p><p>The black fish was enormous yet moved with extraordinary agility and speed.</p><p>The black fish's illusory form undulated its long tail within the dark tide, its eyes deep and fixed on the fleeing figure, as if it could see the streak of light.</p><p>With each flick of its tail, a wave surged from the dark tide, propelling its body forward a great distance.</p><p>…</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had no time to think about how to deal with the enemy behind him, his mind immersed in the restriction on the bubble's surface.</p><p>His efforts paid off; he finally identified several main energy pathways. Through these, he could discern patterns and use them to break the restriction.</p><p>Inside the bubble, the golden light seemed to recede like an outgoing tide, noticeably less intense than before, confirming his earlier suspicion that the bubble space was indeed undergoing unknown changes. The pressure from behind was growing closer.  He couldn't wait any longer!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze and the Heavenly Eye ability merged.  Under his scrutiny, a faint divine light seemed to flow across the bubble's surface.</p><p>Gradually, a resolute expression crossed Qin Sang's face. He suddenly raised his other hand, placing it on the bubble's surface.</p><p>His palms were half-closed, the bubble nestled between them.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's hands turned into a pure, glassy state, radiating Buddhist light, devoid of any fleshy feeling.</p><p>As the Buddhist light enveloped the bubble, the golden light inside remained unchanged.  However, the blue light on the surface suddenly became dazzling, momentarily eclipsing the golden light.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang's arms trembled violently.  He felt a powerful recoil in his palms.  He forcefully squeezed his hands together, desperately suppressing the suddenly erupting blue light.</p><p>‘Bang bang bang…’</p><p>The bubble vibrated violently. Qin Sang's hands clamped onto the bubble like an iron grip, enduring the shock.</p><p>The commotion intensified.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang could suppress it, but gradually lost control. The intense blue light burst forth from the gaps between his hands, dyeing him and the surrounding light waves sky-blue.</p><p>Simultaneously, an invisible wave spread out with the blue light, creating a tremendous spectacle.</p><p>Behind, the dark waves paused. The black fish's illusory form raised its upper body, looking far ahead, its eyes flashing with intense light, and it fiercely whipped its tail, raising a towering dark tide.</p><p>It was the most critical moment to break the restriction. Qin Sang no longer cared about anything else, his mind and the butterfly's merging as one, fully concentrating on breaking the restriction!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The bubble suddenly flew out of his hands. The blue light was completely unblocked, and even within the violently surging valley, it was visible for miles.</p><p>At the same time, a sword light flashed at Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>In an instant, the Cloud-Roaming Sword appeared above the bubble, aiming at the center, and slashed downwards!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>With a shattering sound, the blue light blazed, dazzlingly bright. Qin Sang instinctively narrowed his eyes, a hint of joy flashing in his eyes.</p><p>The blue light's outburst was brief, receding rapidly, and immediately a golden light erupted from the center of the blue light.</p><p>The faint image of fluttering leaves was visible.</p><p>"Got it!"</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced, immediately dashing towards the golden light, his figure disappearing into the dazzling blue and gold radiance.</p><p>A moment later, a voice filled with surprise and anger echoed.</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>What Qin Sang saw upon entering the golden light differed greatly from his expectations, and was completely unlike the other bubbles.</p><p>Previously, when Qin Sang had broken open the bubbles, as long as they hadn't begun to dissipate, the objects inside would appear completely in reality. Qin Sang would take the valuable items, leaving the rest to be shattered by the wave of light.</p><p>The Vajra Bodhi tree, however, didn't appear in reality. Or perhaps it did, but only for a fleeting moment, too brief for even Qin Sang's cultivation to react in time.</p><p>Within the intense golden light, there seemed to be a black hole beneath the tree crown. Qin Sang saw the ancient tree being swallowed by the black hole, a terrifying and ominous energy emanating from within. In an instant, the tree trunk was consumed, and the black hole rapidly closed, leaving only a small section of the crown visible.</p><p>The spiritual tree trembled violently as if struck by a gale. The Vajra fruit he had previously seen swayed wildly, its surface shimmering.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The fruit fell.  Along with the detached Vajra fruit, another, hidden amongst the leaves, also flew out, becoming two points of golden light that vibrated erratically.</p><p>Seeing the black hole about to vanish with the spiritual tree, Qin Sang had no time to think. He used all his strength to activate the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, ignoring the danger and reaching into the black hole. A twisting pain shot through his right hand, forcing him to quickly retract his hand at the last moment!</p><p>The next moment, the black hole dissolved into golden specks of light before him, and the golden light in the void gradually dissipated.</p><p>The spiritual tree and the bubble had vanished, as if they had never existed. Everything around had returned to normal.</p><p>Only the sensation in his palm remained real – cool and surprisingly heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his hand. Two Vajra fruits lay in his palm.</p><p>The Vajra fruits were oval-shaped, about the size of a thumb, their surfaces covered in strange patterns, exuding an extraordinary aura.</p><p>"Two…"</p><p>The astonishment in Qin Sang's eyes remained. The difference was too vast. He had expected to obtain the entire spiritual tree, but ended up with only two fruits.</p><p>Why had this happened?</p><p>He stared at the spot where the tree had been swallowed, unable to comprehend what had transpired in that final moment.</p><p>During the breaking of the seal, Qin Sang had been extremely cautious, and the sword strike on the bubble had been meticulously planned.</p><p>There was nothing unusual about this particular seal-breaking process. The only peculiarity was the contents of the bubble.</p><p>"Could it be because the Vajra Bodhi tree grew in a different place?"</p><p>The Vajra Bodhi tree was likely the source of the disturbances in the blue ocean of light, possessing some kind of mystical power; it was quite possible.</p><p>Where had the Vajra Bodhi tree been taken?</p><p>Had it transformed into another bubble, continuing to wander? Or was there an ancient restriction on the tree itself that had sent it back to where it originally belonged?</p><p>Compared to the countless bubbles in the valley, Qin Sang had encountered very few, making it difficult to draw conclusions. He couldn't figure it out.</p><p>Even more troublesome, he probably couldn't continue searching here; at least not now.</p><p>In any case, the gains from this trip weren't insignificant. He had expected to be satisfied with three or five Vajra fruits; two were better than none.</p><p>Furthermore, his battle with the Duke of Dingxiang, while not resulting in his death, had been a significant victory and would greatly aid Qin Sang in his cultivation.</p><p>Unlike his previous battle with Xiahou, this time he had faced the Duke of Dingxiang at his peak. Until he broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage, he likely wouldn't need to actively seek opponents.</p><p>However, considering his current situation, Qin Sang couldn't be happy. Risking pursuit by the demon king to obtain only two Vajra fruits – was it worth it?</p><p>"Heh heh, you’re rather quick…"</p><p>A sinister chuckle could be faintly heard.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. Behind him, a vast black tide surged forward, its momentum terrifying.</p><p>While he was breaking the seal, the Spirit Void King had caught up.</p><p>The black fish Dharma image's eyes turned to Qin Sang. He saw that nothing remained around Qin Sang, only the lingering golden light.</p><p>It must have taken that fiend to collect both the tree and the fruit!</p><p>Qin Sang felt two icy gazes lock onto him. His back stiffened, and he wryly thought: If I say I only got two Vajra fruits, and offer him one, would this old demon believe me?</p><p>It was needless to say, such a statement would fool no one.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang didn't waste any words, beating his phoenix wings rapidly and vanishing into the distance like a thunderbolt.  He dared not hold back, showcasing his escape technique at its pinnacle before the Spirit Void King.</p><p>Thinking positively, Ling You Wang mistakenly believed that Qin Sang had taken all the King Kong Fruits.  Now, only he knows the spirit tree is still there, and he can return later to search slowly – he still has a chance.</p><p>Of course, this is all contingent on Qin Sang surviving this crisis.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>Lightning ripped through the waves of light, thunder echoing far and wide.</p><p>The black fish apparition revealed a cruelly human-like grin. Its serpentine tail instantly transformed into a dragon's tail, savagely striking the water. The dark waves behind it surged high, forming a cliff-like, massive wave.</p><p>The wave, a thousand feet high, carried an incredibly powerful force and crashed towards the black fish apparition.</p><p>The scales on the black fish apparition's body emitted a faint glow. The huge wave was unable to harm it; instead, it clung to the apparition, propelling it forward at incredible speed.</p><p>At that moment, the speed Ling You Wang unleashed shocked Qin Sang.  The power of a demon king's abilities was truly not to be underestimated!</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>*WHOOSH!*</p><p>…</p><p>Lightning and giant waves, one after the other, chased each other out of the valley.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ding Xiang Hou and Yuan Hou found the other three demon lords. The five demon lords joined forces.</p><p>Ding Xiang Hou took a pill to forcibly suppress his injuries and led the four demon lords back to where they had previously encountered Qin Sang.</p><p>The place was already deserted. The five demons searched and found a mark left by Ling You Wang, but after pursuing it for a while, the mark disappeared.</p><p>"The prince must be in full pursuit of that fellow, unable to spare any attention," Yuan Hou guessed.</p><p>"That fellow is so powerful, his escape techniques are so strong, we are already so much slower; even with the mark, we can't catch him."</p><p>A demon lord beside him said, looking at Ding Xiang Hou, "Among us, only you have the ability to assist the prince, yet you are seriously wounded…"</p><p>At these words, the demons fell silent.</p><p>The other cultivators must have all gone to search for the Divine Court; it's difficult to summon reinforcements now.</p><p>"What are you all moping about? That fellow is insignificant. Whatever his identity, he's impossible to be a Grand Master or a Demon King. No matter how capable he is, can he overturn the heavens? If he got the King Kong Fruits, he'll most likely flee outwards. Let's go outside and intercept him!"</p><p>Ding Xiang Hou snorted coldly, rising on his escaping light.</p><p>Hearing that they were leaving, the other demon lords were reluctant. Although they hadn't obtained the King Kong Fruits, they had also found many treasures during their search.</p><p>In the Spirit Refining Platform, such untouched treasure lands are extremely rare. Missing this opportunity means the treasures will turn to nothingness; they will never have another chance.</p><p>Ding Xiang Hou’s authority was immense; the demons dared not disobey his orders.  Coupled with the lure of the King Kong Fruits, they all followed.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang and Ling You Wang had already flown out of the valley and were heading towards the sea.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly kept an eye on Ling You Wang's movements for Qin Sang.</p><p>Whether Ling You Wang had reached his limit or had some scheme, his speed didn't continue to increase, remaining constantly behind Qin Sang.</p><p>"Perhaps, Ling You Wang intends to exhaust my energy."</p><p>Qin Sang thought this, and it was precisely what he wanted. Even if he couldn't shake off Ling You Wang, as long as he could safely reach the jungle realm, Qin Sang was confident he could fight the demon king!</p><p>He dared not harbor the ambition of killing a demon king; his plan was to recover using the spiritual wood body and find a way to escape.</p><p>*WHOOSH!*</p><p>In a certain part of the sea of light, a blue wave of light suddenly surged into the sky, and a lightning bolt broke through the waves.</p><p>The surrounding scenery came into view. Qin Sang found himself not far from the edge of the sea of light.  Recalling the layout of the surrounding illusions, he quickly analyzed a path, and the electric light bent in mid-air.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a black tide rose from the bottom of the sea of light, chasing the electric light on the surface of the sea of light.</p><p>*WHOOSH!*</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly heard a whooshing sound behind him, and felt a cold gust of wind on his back.</p><p>"Finally couldn't hold back…"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly, without any intention of dodging, urging the Ming Shan Armor. The fragments of the true treasure gathered behind his back.</p><p>*PFFT!*</p><p>A muffled sound like an arrow piercing the water's surface. A mass of dark light exploded behind Qin Sang. It was a black water arrow, extremely powerful, but it failed to injure Qin Sang.</p><p>Ling You Wang's eyes flickered, staring at the armor on Qin Sang for a while. He remembered Qin Sang's earlier battle against two demon lords. It seemed that this armor could not only withstand the attacks of demon lords, but also had unknown miraculous properties.</p><p>This water arrow seemed to be a signal. Immediately afterward, various attacks rained down.</p><p>Qin Sang blocked what he could and dodged what he couldn't, still flying forward without looking back.</p><p>Entangled like this, he finally broke through the edge of the sea of light and entered another illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted. He remembered which parts of these illusions were dangerous and which were safe; several ideas already formed in his mind.</p><p>Ling You Wang must have forcibly used some secret technique to increase his escape speed.  With the right timing, he might be able to shake him off!</p><p>Continuously strategizing, Qin Sang led Ling You Wang through more than a dozen illusions.</p><p>The commotion of their pursuit was impossible to conceal.  Wherever they passed, chaos ensued.</p><p>…</p><p>At this time, Left Zhenren, who was recovering his breath, frowned tightly.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
