<h1>Chapter 298: Guardian Spirit Beast</h1><p>Cloud Wanderer had sent not only a way to break the restriction, but also information about Luo Xingnan and the others and the mountain’s situation.</p><p>In their haste to break the restriction, they’d already lost two people.</p><p>One was Wu Chen; the other, a man with the surname Yin.</p><p>The man with the surname Yin chose betraying Sheng Yuanzi without hesitation to stay alive. He was brutal and ruthless, which made others become even more vigilant toward him. When Luo Xingnan asked him to scout the way, no one spoke up for him.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer was powerless to do anything about it.</p><p>The strength they could rely on was decreasing, while Luo Xingnan and the others’ strength still seemed intact.</p><p>However, thanks to Cloud Wanderer’s information, Qin Sang and Ge Yuan were much better off than Luo Xingnan and the others.</p><p>Although Cloud Wanderer’s report hadn’t mentioned having entered the mountain, if they waited until he had, they might not even get any scraps. So they had no choice but to rely on their own abilities to get through the last two restrictions.</p><p>Although they were in danger, they were lucky enough to get through the restrictions and reach the bottom of the mountain. But what met them was thick fog and clouds.</p><p>It looked exactly the same as what they’d seen from outside.</p><p>They were in a fog, and unlike outside, where they could see everything at a glance, their vision was completely blocked. They could only rely on memory to recall where the spirit medicine grew.</p><p>But Qin Sang and Ge Yuan didn’t act rashly.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang was that, contrary to what he’d imagined, the mountain didn’t seem to be surrounded by restrictions that would put them in danger at every turn.</p><p>He didn’t see anything dangerous as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense and probed at the thick fog. Even at the limit of his divine sense, he still didn’t find any sign of restrictions.</p><p>Luo Xingnan and the others were also nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Ge Yuan had evidently discovered this too, and extremely surprised and incredulously, he said, "Could it be that this place really is the cave master’s medicine garden and the restrictions are only at the foot of the mountain? Are the spirit medicines here… here for the taking?"</p><p>Qin Sang and Ge Yuan’s expressions became grim.</p><p>This was nothing like what they’d anticipated. They’d always thought there would also be many restrictions inside the mountain, and it would be very difficult to find spirit medicine.</p><p>Only then would they have a chance to get their hands on something.</p><p>But after discovering that there weren’t any arrays or restrictions, and they could pick the spirit medicine wherever they wanted, even a huge mountain wasn’t a problem for a cultivator.</p><p>There were only twenty-one spirit medicines.</p><p>They might have already been cleaned out by Luo Xingnan and the others!</p><p>Ge Yuan appeared very unwilling.</p><p>After experiencing so many hardships and countless scheming, they’d reached this point, and the spirit medicine was right before their eyes, but they couldn’t have it. No one would be willing to accept this.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Ge Yuan flickered and rushed up the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang was just as fast as Ge Yuan. He ignored Ge Yuan and went straight to where the dark yellow Qi was.</p><p>The Profound Patterned Yellow Aloe was very important to him. If that spirit medicine wasn’t Profound Patterned Yellow Aloe, then he would give up. But if it was, then he wouldn’t give up.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer had told him that not many people understood the effects of Profound Harmony Harmony Pills. Most people thought they could only restore foundations.</p><p>There were only very few cultivators whose foundations were injured.</p><p>He didn’t know who had obtained this spirit medicine. Maybe there was a chance of trading for it.</p><p>Before Qin Sang and Ge Yuan had taken three steps, a tremendous explosion suddenly sounded from above.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The deafening boom was followed immediately by violent trembling from the mountain.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>That was the sound of rocks shattering.</p><p>Then, a piercing, earsplitting shriek rang out.</p><p>The extremely shrill shriek was filled with anger and fury. It was like a demon’s voice that drilled straight into the ears. Even when they were at the top of the mountain, they could still hear it clearly and it was extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>At the same time as the shriek, several furious roars sounded out. One of them was Luo Xingnan’s!</p><p>Chaos immediately broke out at the top of the mountain.</p><p>The fluctuations from spirit energy colliding traveled far. The fog in the mountain began to violently shake.</p><p>Piercing shrieks echoed out incessantly. Although they weren’t as deep and powerful as the first one, the effect of all of them mixed together was quite deafening, so much that Luo Xingnan and the others’ roars sounded very weak and powerless.</p><p>Luo Xingnan and the others’ opponents were clearly some kind of demon beast. Not only did they have greater numbers, they also seemed extremely powerful. Their voices were mixed together and getting faster and faster, as if they weren’t gaining the upper hand.</p><p>But there was no way to tell their true situation without seeing it for themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ge Yuan halted abruptly and looked at each other. They were slightly uncertain, but more surprised.</p><p>They couldn’t help thinking about the hook serpents that had guarded the entrance.</p><p>It turns out that the mountain was not warded because there exists a guardian spirit beast here.</p><p>This was good news for them. Luoxingnan and his people were obviously fighting the guardian spirit beast, so that proved the spiritual herbs had not been picked yet.</p><p>“Daoist, can you tell what kind of demon beast it is?” Ge Yuan asked via voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang listened closely. There were countless types of demon beasts, and it was difficult to tell from their cries alone. He shook his head. “I can’t tell, but these demon beasts must be very fierce indeed. There’s also sounds from Senior Wanderingzi, so the demon beasts must have gotten to him!”</p><p>Wanderingzi acted with composure, but he was roaring now, so it was possible that he was trying to transmit a message to them.</p><p>“Let’s go for the herbs!”</p><p>Ge Yuan made a decision right away. Luoxingnan and his people were keeping each other busy with the demon beasts, and this was a golden opportunity for the two of them, so why not gather the herbs while they had the chance?</p><p>Ge Yuan tried to rush to a spiritual herb he remembered, but Qin Sang stopped him.</p><p>“Senior Wanderingzi and I worked out that the brightness of the lights could possibly be related to the quality of the spiritual herbs. The lights at the foot of the mountain are mostly dim and thin, so the most precious spiritual herbs are on the peak. The situation is changing rapidly, so we cannot waste any more time at the bottom.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang rushed to the peak.</p><p>Ge Yuan listened to the sounds coming from the peak, and thought to himself that maybe it was just an illusion, but the demon beast’s cries sounded a little weaker.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was just an illusion, he knew Qin Sang was right, so he quickly followed.</p><p>The two restrained their auras and continued to fly toward the peak.</p><p>“Daoist Ge, has Senior Wanderingzi told you which herbs he needs?” Qin Sang asked quickly.</p><p>Wanderingzi appeared to be trapped by the guardian spirit beasts.</p><p>Once Qin Sang had obtained the yellow pattern herb, he planned to take the herb Wanderingzi needed along with him.</p><p>After all, they could successfully make it this far largely thanks to Wanderingzi, so they could not turn against him now.</p><p>“I do not know.”</p><p>Ge Yuan shook his head, but then his gaze shifted in a different direction. He was pleased. “I remember there being the scent of a spiritual herb, and it was very prominent!”</p><p>With that, Ge Yuan overtook Qin Sang and headed in that direction.</p><p>It seemed he would have to search later for a spiritual herb that could mend the soul, but fortunately he knew of such a herb.</p><p>Qin Sang thought it over and changed his course to follow Ge Yuan without a word.</p>
