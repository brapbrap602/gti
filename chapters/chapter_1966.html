<h1>Chapter 1957: The Tea House</h1><p>The Fire Region.</p><p>Here, even the wind has a shape, the shape of flame.</p><p>Fierce flames, like they’re floating on the surface of lava, roar past.</p><p>Above and below, only crimson is visible.</p><p>Occasionally, in the lava, one can see ‘splashes’—strange shapes flashing past.</p><p>This is a pure ocean of lava, not a single piece of land is visible. Only fire beasts with special bloodlines and fire spirits born from the flames can survive here.</p><p>They are unafraid of the environment, swimming through the lava like fish.</p><p>Suddenly, the fiery wind here paused for a moment, gradually revealing two illusory figures.</p><p>These two were Ling Shi and Gui Hou.</p><p>Gui Hou had a fire jade centipede coiled around his arm, seemingly communicating with it, then pointed downwards.</p><p>“Brother Ling, it’s here! Lord Zhuque mentioned before that some Black Magic Lilies grow beneath this lava.  I wonder if their medicinal properties meet your requirements.”</p><p>“Black Magic Lilies prefer to grow in places where the fiery power is most intense and volatile, absorbing fire toxins as nourishment. The environment greatly impacts their quality. If I were using them myself, superior quality Black Magic Lilies would suffice, but this time it's for a fierce poison a senior requires; only the finest quality will do.”</p><p>Ling Shi gently twitched his nostrils, using a secret technique to sense the surroundings, then nodded.  “This place is good, it has the potential to nurture top-grade Black Magic Lilies. Let’s go down and have a look!”</p><p>The two plunged downwards.  The lava parted to either side, then instantly closed again, returning to normal.</p><p>The lava was bottomless.</p><p>Gui Hou led the way, descending continuously, and transmitted his voice: “Brother Ling, how many plants do you think will reach top-grade quality in the entire field? How many are needed to make the poison?”</p><p>“The more, the better!” Ling Shi replied.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Gui Hou frowned. “In the entire Fire Region, there are probably not many places like this, and if a certain size is reached, they would likely be enclosed. The three major sects of the Fire Region are all proficient in fire-elemental techniques, and there are countless smaller forces; even if they don’t cultivate Black Magic Lilies, they could create medicinal fields.”</p><p>“Let's do our best; this isn't the only option! Besides, the senior is incredibly powerful and will surely have a way.  If he wanted to unify the Fire Region, it wouldn’t be difficult at all, right?” Ling Shi said with ease.</p><p>Since being brought back by Qin Sang, Ling Shi had initially been somewhat apprehensive, but now he felt at ease.</p><p>Here, he could simply concentrate on understanding the way of poison, researching various potent poisons—Qin Sang would fully support him in whatever he needed.</p><p>This kind of treatment is usually only given to master alchemists.</p><p>Although there is a saying that alchemy and poison making are inseparable, Ling Shi does also know some alchemy, but his poison cultivation isn't purely about crafting poisons, and lacking alchemic lineage, he is still not comparable to a true master alchemist.</p><p>The price is limited freedom, but he’s already been targeted by the Fallen Soul Abyss, so he had no choice.</p><p>Gui Hou could not be as casual as Ling Shi, shaking his head. “While that’s true, as subordinates, we must do our best to relieve our master's worries.”</p><p>As they spoke, the two descended to an extreme depth.</p><p>The temperature not only didn't decrease, but the intense, volatile energy felt even more concentrated.</p><p>Gradually, the lava became invisible to the naked eye, turning into pure fire streams flowing from all directions.</p><p>It's unimaginable what kind of apocalyptic scene would result if this power were to erupt.</p><p>“Fire Region cultivators call such places the ‘Yan Pool,’ where the fiery power undergoes transformation.  Even in the powerful Yan Pool, we must be cautious. The Black Magic Lilies are linked to the Yan Pool's energy; we must be careful when harvesting them, lest the Yan Pool erupts.”</p><p>Gui Hou cautioned.</p><p>As they spoke, they descended further, deliberately slowing their speed.</p><p>The surrounding scenery changed dramatically, and even the two Nascent Soul cultivators felt an instinctive pressure.</p><p>Without warning, the surroundings suddenly calmed.</p><p>Here, there was no turbulence at all.</p><p>The stillness, however, felt extremely strange, as if a vast force was accumulating, ready to erupt and destroy everything.</p><p>There was fire here too, burning quietly, with pale blue flames gently swaying, giving off a delicate impression.</p><p>They carefully entered this space, avoiding the flames, and soon found a shadowed area within the blue flames.</p><p>The shadows weren’t completely dark; they emitted a dark blue light.</p><p>Amidst the glow, scattered dark blue lily-like flowers floated, some a deeper hue, others lighter.</p><p>There was no soil; they hung suspended, their roots clearly visible, countless blue tendrils reaching into the flames, drawing sustenance.</p><p>“One, two… there are five superior Dark Demon Lilies!”</p><p>Ling Shi’s face lit up; he’d expected at most two or three.</p><p>He moved to a superior Dark Demon Lily, his right hand reaching for the root ball.</p><p>His fingers moved gently, a strange wave emanating from his fingertips, encasing the root ball.</p><p>Ling Shi focused intently, his movements soft yet decisive, carefully lifting the root ball, then patiently picking out each tendril from the flames.</p><p>Harvesting one Dark Demon Lily took about ten days.</p><p>Gui Hou, observing the complete flower, offered assistance.</p><p>As they concentrated on harvesting, a sudden intuition caused them to stop and exchange a look.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!” Gui Hou said gravely.</p><p>This magma region teemed with countless fire beasts and fire spirits, naturally chaotic.</p><p>Their herb gathering in the Yan Pool couldn’t detect every external fluctuation; a simple passerby wouldn’t disturb them.</p><p>But this was different; the newcomer was fleeing frantically, as if pursued, crashing directly into their space.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi, exercising restraint, tracked the intruder’s direction through the emanating waves.</p><p>“Not heading here,” Gui Hou said, his expression relaxing slightly.</p><p>Before he finished, they sensed another presence, quickly approaching.</p><p>Ling Shi murmured, “Indeed,” then exclaimed in surprise, “Two Transcendence cultivators!”</p><p>Transcendence cultivators were rare in the Fire Domain. To encounter two, engaged in pursuit, was unusual.</p><p>“Probably from the Three Sects of the Fire Domain, but none of our concern. Let’s focus,” Gui Hou shook his head, noticing Ling Shi’s changed expression.</p><p>“That pursuer… it’s a Corpse Demon from the Lost Soul Abyss!”</p><p>Ling Shi’s eyes narrowed, a cold smile playing on his lips.  “Those inhuman things… I can smell their corpse stench through the magma!”</p><p>…</p><p>Above.</p><p>A crimson streak sped through the magma.</p><p>Within the escaping light was a burly man. Qin Sang would recognize him: Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect, the one Qin Sang’s avatar had drawn in when destroying the sand bandits.</p><p>Now, Fu Xiao’s massive frame was hunched, his face ashen, clearly badly injured.</p><p>A bloody hole gaped in his chest, his robes torn.</p><p>The wound nearly pierced his back, severely damaging his internal organs.</p><p>Worse than the wound was the green flame clinging to it, like a malignant growth, preventing healing, devouring his life force, rendering even numerous healing pills useless.</p><p>‘Huff! Huff! Huff!’</p><p>While fleeing, Fu Xiao manipulated hand seals, spitting out a ball of spiritual fire.</p><p>It entangled with the green flame, but failed to extinguish it.</p><p>Repeated attempts only temporarily suppressed it.</p><p>Worse still, the green flame was silently invading his insides.</p><p>Normally, he had several methods to eliminate it, but severely wounded and pursued, any option was hopeless.</p><p>He mentally calculated the distance to his sect, growing more anxious; at this rate, he'd die before reaching safety.</p><p>He’d stumbled upon the Corpse Demon's hiding place, unaware of another hidden attacker.  A single misstep led to an ambush; his communication artifact was destroyed, leaving him utterly alone.</p><p>Behind, the chilling aura relentlessly pursued, rapidly closing in.</p><p>The pursuer was a green flame, highly visible in the magma.</p><p>Fu Xiao, versed in the Six Harmonies Sect’s techniques, moved like a fish in magma, incredibly fast, yet this green flame kept pace!</p><p>The green flame concealed another large figure, seemingly even bigger than Fu Xiao, one of those Qin Sang had roused with the bronze pillar.</p><p>The others were gone; this man alone hunted Fu Xiao.</p><p>“Hmph! If Lord Fei Luo hadn’t returned to report, and Rou Ji hadn’t been injured, you wouldn’t be escaping!  Give it up!”</p><p>The large man roared, his robes billowing as green flames erupted from him, transforming him into a human torch.</p><p>Green flames spread, instantly dyeing the surrounding magma green. The green magma instantly shifted from scorching heat to icy cold.</p><p>The green flames spread incredibly fast.  Fu Xiao had only just noticed something was wrong when he was surrounded by the green magma, his instincts immediately raising the alarm.</p><p>Without warning, a bone-white ghostly claw emerged from the green flames. Its five fingers, sharp as swords, clawed towards his back.</p><p>If this attack landed, Fu Xiao's life would be in grave danger.</p><p>Fortunately, he was prepared. A fiery red pattern, resembling but subtly different from the Bagua , formed on his back.</p><p>As the Bagua fire pattern appeared, a muffled thunderclap echoed.</p><p>The ghostly claw struck the pattern, causing it to violently shake and crack, but it managed to hold the claw back for a moment.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity to dash forward. He should have been able to distance himself from his pursuer, but he felt another icy wind.</p><p>The ghostly claw, appearing and disappearing at will, materialized in front of him, aiming for his face.</p><p>Fu Xiao was terrified, but within his panic, a fierce determination shone. He opened his mouth, spitting not flames, but a pearl.</p><p>This pearl possessed an extraordinarily brilliant luster. It was the Chi Xi Pearl, a treasured item Fu Xiao relied heavily upon. Now, to escape, he had no choice but to destroy it.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Chi Xi Pearl shot towards the ghostly claw. The claw instantly sensed the danger and retracted its fingers, attempting to flee into the green magma.</p><p>But the claw was too close to Fu Xiao, and he had planned this carefully, his timing impeccable.</p><p>With a ‘boom’, the Chi Xi Pearl exploded, unleashing a fire serpent entwined with fragments, its claws and fangs bared, charging out.</p><p>A roar erupted from the magma. The ghostly claw, unable to escape in time, simply stopped retracting.  Its five fingers spread, revealing a black eye embedded in its palm, rotating left and right like a living thing, eerily unnatural.</p><p>The eye blinked, shooting a black beam from its pupil towards the fire serpent created from the Chi Xi Pearl.</p><p>The moment the two forces collided, a figure faintly appeared behind the ghostly claw, recoiling.</p><p>The Chi Xi Pearl’s power was immense, instantly destroying the black beam.</p><p>The tall man looked rather disheveled, but he hadn’t sustained serious injuries, having mostly dodged the attack.</p><p>However, the green flames that had infected the magma were fading.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity to escape, flicking his sleeve, sending several beams of light toward the enemy. Then, without looking back at the result, he chose a direction and fled with all his might.</p><p>He remembered the ruins of a Liuhemen site from thousands of years ago.</p><p>The brief battle had aggravated Fu Xiao’s injuries. He knew that relying on his own strength alone, escaping was nearly impossible.</p><p>He hoped the ruins still existed; that was his only hope!</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi temporarily stopped gathering herbs and quietly left the Yanchi .</p><p>They didn’t get too close to the battlefield, but judging by the energy fluctuations, they could infer the situation quite accurately.</p><p>"That's the Dian Cang Art of Liuhemen!" Gui Hou rarely went out, but he knew about the local powers, especially the three sects of the Fire Domain.</p><p>"A corpse demon from Luohun Abyss pursuing a Liuhemen expert here—don't you find that odd?"</p><p>Ling Shi was eager to act.  "Luohun Abyss is extending its influence into the Fire Domain again; there must be a grand scheme! We'd better find out what's going on and be prepared, lest we disturb the Daoist retreat and upset the senior cultivators’ cultivation!"</p><p>Gui Hou glanced at Ling Shi. He knew Ling Shi had a feud with Luohun Abyss and certainly wanted to take revenge.</p><p>Ling Shi's words did hold some truth.</p><p>But Gui Hou also considered the possibility that everything might have been peaceful, but their interference might provoke the ancestor of Luohun Abyss.</p><p>Gui Hou followed Qin Sang from the Talisman Realm to the Greater Thousand World, knowing that Qin Sang’s breakthrough to the Transcendent Void stage was certainly not through normal means, and might not stand a chance against a true Transcendent Void cultivator. Therefore, they should strengthen their foundation and postpone such encounters as long as possible.</p><p>"Don't worry, this guy is not that important in Luohun Abyss; it's surely not just him infiltrating the Fire Domain. The Old Demon has several late-stage Nascent Soul demons under him. Losing one corpse demon wouldn't even make him blink," Ling Shi confidently stated.</p><p>Just as they were at an impasse, they heard a voice.</p><p>They immediately stopped, their expressions turning respectful. After listening intently for a moment, they bowed simultaneously towards the void.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Only after the voice disappeared did they straighten up.</p><p>Ling Shi laughed. "As expected, the senior already knows everything!"</p><p>Gui Hou remained noncommittal, looking ahead and rushing forward. "Daoist Friend Ling, we need to carefully discuss the plan. The Master wants to capture him alive; there must be no mistakes. We can only rely on your poison skills from now on."</p><p>"No problem! Luohun Abyss corpse demons are constantly refining corpse poison; ordinary poisons are ineffective against them, but my poison arts are an exception. I guarantee he won't survive!"</p><p>…</p><p>In the Daoist retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang’s main body sat cross-legged on a stone bed, surrounded by twinkling stars.</p>
