<h1>Chapter 1668: A Last Resort</h1><p>Chapter 1668: A Last Resort</p><p>After swallowing the Nascent Soul, the chains' imprints on the ancient demon began to fade, and the power of the seal weakened.</p><p>“A last resort? Is this it?”</p><p>Rune phantoms appeared on his wrists, but the ancient demon ignored them.  A mass of demonic energy in the void violently surged towards the runes, forming a demonic vortex that easily tore them apart!</p><p>The Xi You Alliance Leader let out a bitter smile.</p><p>“Child’s play!”</p><p>The ancient demon scoffed, looking towards the Demon Lord with a sarcastic tone, “Self-proclaimed Demon Lord?  Quite the grandiose title!”</p><p>His gaze swept over both the Xi You Alliance Leader and the Demon Lord. “Will you two obediently offer up your Nascent Souls, or willingly open your minds so I can implant demonic restrictions, making you my demonic servants?”</p><p>The Xi You Alliance Leader remained silent, a flute floating before her – her life-bound treasure.</p><p>The flute scattered starlight, like glittering dust, transforming into a barrier resembling a star river, encircling her.</p><p>The Demon Lord remained calm and unmoved.</p><p>“Since you are an ancient demon lord, imprisoned in the ancient prison and still possessing such power after all this time, you must have experienced the ancient cataclysm. You must know the reason for the ruin of the cultivation world. Is there a way for us, later cultivators, to break this deadlock in the current era?”</p><p>His tone wasn’t that of someone facing a formidable enemy, but rather someone seeking guidance from a senior.</p><p>The ancient demon licked his lips, his eyes bloodshot, and said in a seductive tone: “Want to know? Become my servant, and I will answer your questions. Only by joining me do you have a chance to break the deadlock. Otherwise, the late Nascent Soul stage is your limit.  Unable to improve your cultivation, you will eventually perish in the heavenly tribulation!”</p><p>The Demon Lord sighed, “Perhaps it’s not necessary to go through all that trouble. I could simply search your soul and learn everything…”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the ancient demon’s gaze darkened, coldly stating: “Since you are both so stubborn, I shall simply take your Nascent Souls! Kill!”</p><p>With a command,</p><p>The spirit sword hovering above the Dong Ji Alliance Leader let out a soft hum.  Countless sword energies erupted, transforming into a magnificent array, descending upon the Xi You Alliance Leader.</p><p>The Dong Ji Alliance Leader was a sword cultivator who had mastered the sword’s momentum. His sword array held a terrifying pressure, suppressing the Xi You Alliance Leader.</p><p>Sword light filled the sky like a boundless ocean, with sword energy seemingly everywhere.</p><p>In comparison, the star river created by the Xi You Alliance Leader’s flute appeared weak, dim, and insignificant, seeming as if it could extinguish at any moment.</p><p>The Xi You Alliance Leader didn't choose to confront the Dong Ji Alliance Leader directly.</p><p>As former companions who had spent many years together, even after establishing their separate alliances, they had secretly supported each other to counter other forces, cooperating frequently. They were thoroughly familiar with each other's strengths and methods.</p><p>The Xi You Alliance Leader remained calm, quickly finding a weak point in the sword array.</p><p>The flute played a melodious tune, and invisible waves rippled outwards.  The starlight, like snowflakes, bloomed one after another.</p><p>The originally dim star river transformed into a glacial, ethereal glow, protecting the Xi You Alliance Leader. The invisible waves collided with the sword energy, annihilating each other simultaneously. Her life-bound treasure blocked the sword array's might, allowing her to quickly approach the Demon Lord.</p><p>The ancient demon moved faster and more spectacularly than the Dong Ji Alliance Leader.</p><p>At this time, wearing Su Nu's face, he lacked any trace of charm; his expression was ferocious, his mouth opened wide, letting out a sharp howl as demonic energy surged around him, instantly swelling.</p><p>The already dim ravine instantly became pitch-black, transforming into a demonic realm.</p><p>The ancient demon’s figure disappeared, hidden within the demonic energy, his concealment technique extraordinarily skillful and eerie, making him untraceable.</p><p>Seeing this, the Demon Lord's eyes narrowed slightly.  Without any visible movement, ghostly howls erupted around him,淒慘刺耳, shaking his spirit.</p><p>Then, brilliant light shone around him.</p><p>Within the light, countless ghosts crowded together, shadowing him, their scarlet eyes wide, ferocious and violent, searching for the ancient demon's whereabouts.</p><p>This was the Demon Lord’s renowned supernatural power, the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light!</p><p>Demons energy pressed down, the ancient demon's ambition vast, aiming to wipe out both the Xi You Alliance Leader and the Demon Lord.</p><p>In an instant, the Demon Lord was enveloped in demonic energy, but the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light was not suppressed, instead surging back, like ocean waves, attempting to disperse the demonic energy and force out the ancient demon's true form.</p><p>The Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light was lauded as the foremost divine light of the Canglang Sea, a supremely yin and evil supernatural power that struck fear into the hearts of all who heard its name.</p><p>Even the powerful Demon Lord felt threatened, surrounded as he was by demonic energy.  His divine light, unable to disperse the miasma, shifted to defense.  Some of the light was extinguished, and the malevolent spirits within it vanished without a sound.</p><p>His divine power proved insufficient.  Undeterred, the Demon Lord's eyes flashed.  He clenched his hand, his divine light contracting, condensing into a dark, spectral blade. He aimed it at a point within the demonic energy and struck.</p><p>The blade sliced through the demonic miasma.</p><p>A surprised gasp echoed from within. A dark figure materialized, then shimmered, narrowly avoiding the blade in a terrifyingly close call.</p><p>The ancient demon's true form had been revealed.</p><p>But the Demon Lord's deliberate strike had failed to inflict any damage.  His relaxed expression vanished, replaced by grim determination.</p><p>At that moment, the East Pole Lord and the West Gloom Lord arrived, engaged in battle. The ancient demon, seizing the opportunity, enveloped himself in pure demonic energy, forming a massive curtain that trapped both the Demon Lord and the West Gloom Lord.</p><p>The curtain's power was awe-inspiring, pressing down alongside the East Pole Lord's sword formation.  The West Gloom Lord, pale-faced, maneuvered his magical flute through the gaps in the formation, rejoining the Demon Lord.</p><p>Just then, a figure arrived swiftly and silently near the mountain hollow—the elder who had taken the stone tablet.  Witnessing the scene in the hollow, he gasped.</p><p>"The ancient demon!"</p><p>He was too late.  The ancient demon had already escaped the tablet, though the seal was not completely broken.</p><p>"Demon Lord! West Gloom Lord! Did you release the ancient demon?"</p><p>The elder, noticing the spectral blade and recognizing the two fighting the ancient demon, angrily transmitted his question.</p><p>The Demon Lord, his attack having failed, retracted his blade for defense. Sensing the elder's transmission, a flicker of interest crossed his eyes.  "Who are you? Knowing the ancient demon was sealed here… are you a descendant of the Four Saints Palace?  I never expected the long-fallen Four Saints Palace to have a hidden master. Your arrival is opportune…"</p><p>"Do you know the enormity of your crime!  With the ancient demon unleashed, the Canglang Sea will be devastated!"  the elder roared, furious.</p><p>The Demon Lord sneered, "I don't see how powerful the ancient demon is now!  His strength, while significant, is limited. Let him rampage for a while.  A few more of us, and killing this demon will be child's play.  Don't spread alarmist rumors! Instead of this, help us escape, gather other cultivators, and besiege this demon. If we wait any longer, he'll break free and defeat us one by one.  If he devours a few more Yuan Ying cultivators, *that* will be a true disaster!"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>The elder was stunned by the Demon Lord's attitude.  Then, seeing the East Pole Lord, he was even more bewildered.</p><p>All three were renowned figures in the cultivation world.  Not only had they released the ancient demon, but one of them appeared to have been manipulated by it.</p>
