<h1>Chapter 1669:  Hidden Agendas</h1><p>“You think the Ancient Demon is weak because his seals haven't been fully broken! Do you know how many human cultivators he slaughtered when he first appeared?”</p><p>The elder roared.</p><p>“Friend, please calm down. We never expected this seal to contain the Ancient Demon. The East Pole leader was deceived by him, helped him escape, and even provided him with a physical body…”</p><p>The West幽 leader glanced at the Demon Lord, secretly transmitting a message to the elder, explaining, “The Ancient Demon’s escape is a done deal. Even if we kill ourselves to atone, it won't help.  Since you are a descendant of the Four Saints, do you know how to subdue this demon?”</p><p>The Ancient Demon’s power surged.  </p><p>He and the Demon Lord were trapped in the demonic energy, with the East Pole leader assisting.</p><p>The situation was dire.</p><p>The Demon Lord snorted. “No matter the carnage the Ancient Demon caused back then, after being sealed for so many years, how much power could he possibly have left?  Enough talk. Do you have a solution or not?!”</p><p>“Thankfully, you didn't foolishly release all his seals.  Our four ancestors left behind a countermeasure, anticipating the Ancient Demon's return…”</p><p>The elder quickly transmitted his voice, his tone urgent.</p><p>“What countermeasure did the Four Saints prepare?”</p><p>The West幽 leader’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Ancient Demon’s power was steadily recovering.  They could still resist now, but once he broke free of the seals, their fate would be sealed.</p><p>“I have a way to temporarily suppress the Ancient Demon, then we can repair the seal. But it will take time to set up, and the Ancient Demon will inevitably notice. You must keep him occupied. His seals are weakening; any later, and it'll be too late…”</p><p>The elder said anxiously, not appearing to help the two, but secretly approaching the edge of the ravine, hiding in the shadows, gazing at the stele in the center of the ravine.</p><p>As the elder said, the traces of chains on the Ancient Demon were slowly fading. Once they disappeared completely, his power would return.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the West幽 leader stood close together, resisting the attacks of the Ancient Demon and the East Pole leader.</p><p>The situation was critical, a desperate struggle.</p><p>Finally, a tearing sound came from above the ravine. The elder's figure flashed, soaring into the air above the ravine, his palm pressing down, sending a beam of green light towards the stele.</p><p>At this moment, the jade stele activated, transforming into a half-man-high, crystal-clear object.</p><p>In the ravine, the Ancient Demon suddenly looked up, staring intently at the stele, his eyes filled with madness. He abandoned the Demon Lord and the other, recklessly charging towards the elder.</p><p>“Quickly! Stop him!”</p><p>The elder manipulated the stele, shouting loudly.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the West幽 leader exchanged glances, attacking with all their might.</p><p>The East Pole leader, having received the Ancient Demon's orders, was about to recall his spirit sword and turn his sword array against the elder, when a cold light flew towards him, an invisible ripple spreading, enveloping the sword.</p><p>The sword sang like thunder, its light blazing, yet for a time it could not escape the entanglement.</p><p>The West幽 leader turned defense into offense, holding back his former friend.</p><p>The Demon Lord opened his mouth, spitting out a ball of yellow light, containing a dull yellow stone knife.</p><p>The stone knife was crude, as if roughly hewn from a stone, its blade chipped, the handle missing, and the edge also notched.</p><p>The stone knife appeared, hovering before the Demon Lord, without any powerful aura, unremarkable.</p><p>Then, the Yin Heavenly Ghost divine light erupted, as if drawn from the waters of the Yellow Springs, with tormented and maddened ghosts swirling within, causing one’s scalp to tingle.</p><p>The divine light didn't strike the Ancient Demon, but shot towards the stone knife.</p><p>The stone knife trembled slightly, a powerful suction force emanating from it, swallowing the Yin Heavenly Ghost divine light entirely.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The yellow light was dazzling.</p><p>The stone knife transformed into a bloodthirsty demon blade, radiating a thirst for blood, extremely eerie.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The stone knife vibrated repeatedly, suddenly flicking its blade.</p><p>The yellow light flashed and disappeared, leaving only the afterimage of the stone knife. In an instant, the stone knife itself appeared behind the Ancient Demon's heart, aiming for a vital point.</p><p>A gust of wind swept by.</p><p>The Ancient Demon felt an ominous premonition.</p><p>This attack was extraordinary; the Demon Lord had been planning this for a long time.</p><p>The moment he sensed the stone knife's aura, the essence blood within this body, and the Ancient Demon's demonic soul, felt a pull.</p><p>If struck by the stone knife, even with the Ancient Demon’s strength, the essence of his physical body would likely be completely devoured.</p><p>The stone knife was of extraordinary origin; such a treasure couldn't be refined by present-day cultivators. It was an ancient evil artifact that the Demon Lord had obtained from a hidden realm in the inner palace.</p><p>Gu Mo formed hand seals, his demonic energy swirling to create a curtain of magic that pressed down on the stone blade, yet his own speed didn't falter.  Suddenly, he felt something amiss.</p><p>Since escaping the stele and fully inhabiting his body, he had relentlessly attacked the seal.  The chain marks on his face had been gradually fading, especially after absorbing a Nascent Soul cultivator, becoming even fainter.  But now, inexplicably, the chain marks deepened, and thin streaks of lightning appeared.</p><p>Simultaneously, within the grand sealing array, a spiritual talisman rose from several sacrificial altars, including the main altar.  Cultivators, all close confidantes of the Xi You Alliance Leader and the Demon Lord, surrounded the auxiliary altars, rapidly forming hand seals to activate the talismans.</p><p>An unknown wave traced back to the seal. The talismans shattered instantly, revealing power similar to the Demon Slaughter True Spirit Talisman, though far less potent.  Yet, this new power affected the Demon Slaughter True Spirit Talisman.</p><p>The previously dimmed, suppressed Lei Suo (Thunder Lock) found a respite. While still unable to rival the Demon Slaughter True Spirit Talisman, it could hold out longer, even counterattack.</p><p>Lei Suo struck with force, causing Gu Mo to groan as his demonic energy surged.</p><p>“It’s you!” Gu Mo roared, instantly understanding.</p><p>“My centuries of research into talisman arrays… all thanks to you!” The Xi You Alliance Leader gritted her teeth. She possessed a considerable talent for talismans. The Demon Slaughter True Spirit Talisman and the arrays Gu Mo had given them were incredibly profound, impossible for Nascent Soul cultivators to fully grasp, yet the Alliance Leader had managed to discover some patterns.  Unfortunately, she could only influence one main altar and needed others to help activate the talismans at the corresponding auxiliary altars.  She was far from Gu Mo's level; he alone could command the array and assault the entire seal.</p><p>Gu Mo's energy fluctuated, his demonic energy stagnating.  The stone blade seized the opportunity, breaking through the curtain and forcing Gu Mo back.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The jade stele crashed down.</p><p>A sudden change!</p><p>Behind the elder, a figure silently emerged from a distortion in space, two icy gazes locking onto him.  Hand seals formed swiftly, and a fire lotus shot towards his back with lightning speed!  Simultaneously, the Demon Lord dashed towards the jade stele.</p><p>The attacker was Mou Lao Mo, who had been lying in wait. The elder was caught off guard, instantly understanding, filled with shock and rage.</p><p>The Demon Lord's true intention was to use Gu Mo to lure out the Four Saints Palace heir and seize the Demon Subduing Stele!</p><p>"The Four Saints obtained a treasure surpassing even spiritual treasures in the Seven Killing Hall.  Later, internal strife caused the Four Saints Palace to decline and disappear, but the treasure vanished. This must be it," the Demon Lord’s eyes burned with avarice.</p><p>As he expected, Gu Mo, sealed for many years, was significantly weakened.  Obtaining the Demon Subduing Stele would eliminate any concerns, even if Gu Mo broke free.</p><p>The elder was unaware that the Demon Slaying Array had already been laid outside the Town Spirit Domain.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>This is to make up for yesterday's; today's will follow shortly.</p>
