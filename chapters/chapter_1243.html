<h1>Chapter 1,235: Schemes</h1><p>On the stone platform.</p><p>Dongyang Bo activated the Diamond Bracelet, concealing his form.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a while, noticing that Dongyang Bo remained motionless, which only deepened his curiosity.</p><p>It seemed that Dongyang Bo had been here for quite some time.</p><p>Dongyang Bo held a position akin to that of an alliance leader among the righteous factions of the Little Cold Domain. His role in thwarting the plans of the Old Demon Ye was of great significance to the ongoing conflict. It was strange that instead of rushing to join the others and strategize, he had come here alone.</p><p>At first, Qin Sang suspected that there might be a treasure hidden nearby, and that Dongyang Bo had uncovered some clues from ancient texts, intending to claim it for himself before rejoining the others. However, the longer he observed, the more he felt something was amiss.</p><p>After a long while, Dongyang Bo still did nothing, simply standing there idly.</p><p>If he were waiting for a treasure to emerge, there would be no need for him to go to such lengths to conceal himself with his life-bound treasure, unless there were guardian beasts protecting the treasure.</p><p>Even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had nearly overlooked him, which showed just how cautious Dongyang Bo was.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to keep an eye on Dongyang Bo's movements while he maintained his distance, quietly shifting his position to observe the surroundings, trying to discern Dongyang Bo's intentions.</p><p>Running into an enemy unexpectedly, with the enemy in the open and himself hidden, Qin Sang would not let such an opportunity slip by.</p><p>Thus, he decisively stowed away the Fat Chicken, preparing to wait and see what Dongyang Bo was scheming.</p><p>If he could exact revenge, all the better. Even if the right moment for vengeance didn't present itself immediately, the chance to disrupt Dongyang Bo's plans and seize the treasure he was after would be a satisfying way to vent his anger. Qin Sang was more than willing to do so.</p><p>After scanning the area, Qin Sang found no trace of anyone else.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was alone here.</p><p>Moreover, aside from the ancient restrictions on the two nearby mountain peaks, there were no other anomalies in the vicinity, nor any signs of a treasure about to emerge.</p><p>This made Dongyang Bo's actions even more perplexing.</p><p>"What is he waiting for?"</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly baffled and decided to continue waiting it out with Dongyang Bo.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>Streaks of blood-red lightning descended from the sky, continuously striking the mountain peaks.</p><p>The surroundings were filled with thunderous roars, yet they could not mask the desolation and silence of this place.</p><p>In such a location, two peculiar individuals now lurked in the shadows, neither moving for a long time, as if waiting for something.</p><p>Qin Sang was patient, but he began to wonder if he had mistaken the Diamond Bracelet for some similar treasure within the white light.</p><p>However, he couldn't let the Heavenly Eye Butterfly take a closer look.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's cultivation was a step above his own, and since he wasn't distracted by other tasks, any attempt to spy on him might alert him to Qin Sang's presence.</p><p>At that moment, a figure suddenly flew in from the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been keeping his eyes on Dongyang Bo, noticed a slight fluctuation in the white light and only then spotted the uninvited guest. Turning his head, he saw a streak of light speeding toward them from afar.</p><p>"Dongyang Bo is waiting for this person."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Contrary to his initial assumption, Dongyang Bo's goal wasn't to seek treasure but to wait for someone.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>A faint, almost imperceptible sigh came from within the white light, "You've finally arrived. I was beginning to think I had misjudged you."</p><p>Then, the white light dimmed as Dongyang Bo suppressed the fluctuations of the Diamond Bracelet and swiftly moved down from the stone platform, hiding in an even more concealed spot.</p><p>"Could this be Dongyang Bo's enemy?"</p><p>Seeing Dongyang Bo's actions, Qin Sang quickly ran through the list of Nascent Soul cultivators who had entered the Blood Lake.</p><p>Most of those who had entered the Blood Lake were Nascent Soul cultivators from the Little Cold Domain.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was a skilled diplomat, and his only rivals were those with conflicting interests, such as Daoist Chongyi, but their conflicts were far from life-and-death struggles. Qin Sang couldn't even find an ally among them.</p><p>As the figure drew closer, Qin Sang realized that this person wasn't a Nascent Soul cultivator but rather the master of the Upper Yuan Pure Palaceâ€”Gongliang Yu.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen him at Stone Qu Mountain and recognized him at a glance.</p><p>"Why is it him?"</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly astonished.</p><p>The Upper Yuan Pure Palace had a deep foundation and was ranked among the super sects. However, for several hundred years, none of its disciples had reached the Nascent Soul stage, making its reputation somewhat undeserved.</p><p>As a result, the Upper Yuan Pure Palace had to ally itself with a powerful faction to avoid being at a disadvantage when competing with other sects for resources. Given their good relations with Shaohua Mountain, they had chosen to stand together.</p><p>The previous palace master, Iron-Crowned Master, and the current master, Gongliang Yu, had both followed this path. Back when Qin Sang was at Shaohua Mountain, he had addressed the elders of the Upper Yuan Pure Palace as "Uncle-Master" or "Elder."</p><p>By all logic, Gongliang Yu and Dongyang Bo should have been very close.</p><p>The Upper Yuan Pure Palace and Shaohua Mountain were like branches of the same tree, and there had been no rumors of any conflicts between them. Yet Dongyang Bo's current actions seemed to suggest he was planning to ambush Gongliang Yu, leaving Qin Sang utterly confused about his intentions.</p><p>Gongliang Yu was completely unaware that he had fallen into the sights of two Nascent Soul cultivators. Holding a wooden carving in one hand and a jade tablet in the other, he flew closer. When he saw the two nearly identical twin peaks, a look of joy spread across his face.</p><p>"Finally found it!"</p><p>He descended and landed between the two mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly retreated some distance, putting more space between himself and Gongliang Yu, waiting to see what Dongyang Bo would do.</p><p>With Dongyang Bo's cultivation level, there was no need for him to resort to ambush to kill Gongliang Yu.</p><p>Of course, Gongliang Yu was the master of the Upper Yuan Pure Palace, inheriting the entire sect's legacy, and was himself a peak Golden Core expert. He undoubtedly had life-saving measures at his disposal.</p><p>However, in a place like the Blood Lake, such measures might be restricted.</p><p>Perhaps this was why Dongyang Bo had chosen to act here.</p><p>Seeing the joy on Gongliang Yu's face, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a pang of pity for him.</p><p>Upon landing, Gongliang Yu remained vigilant, but he could never have imagined that two Nascent Soul cultivators were plotting against him.</p><p>"The Twin Peaks, this is the place!"</p><p>Gongliang Yu looked up, surveying the twin peaks, which matched the description in the message perfectly.</p><p>"About ten miles north from here, and I'll reach the destination. Once I obtain the Blood Ganoderma, and after I form my Nascent Soul, I won't have to kowtow to anyone anymore!"</p><p>Gongliang Yu seemed to recall some unpleasant memories, a cold smile tugging at his lips as he eagerly summoned his light and sped northward.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in place, watching as the white light concealing Dongyang Bo drifted after Gongliang Yu.</p><p>After waiting a while longer, Qin Sang finally moved.</p><p>As the saying goes, the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't fathom Dongyang Bo's intentions, making it difficult for him to decide on a course of action.</p><p>If Dongyang Bo killed Gongliang Yu, it was likely part of a plan to annex the Upper Yuan Pure Palace.</p><p>By absorbing the Upper Yuan Pure Palace, not only would Shaohua Mountain's strength increase significantly, but Dongyang Bo would also gain access to the sect's techniques and secrets, making him even harder to deal with in the future.</p><p>Both emotionally and logically, Qin Sang couldn't stand by and let Dongyang Bo kill Gongliang Yu. Saving him would not only clip one of Dongyang Bo's wings but also leave him with a mortal enemy.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Qin Sang remained expressionless, trailing far behind.</p><p>Before long, Gongliang Yu, who was at the front, came to a stop.</p><p>Before Gongliang Yu stood an unremarkable hill, but at its base was a cave, its interior a deep crimson, with blood mist continuously billowing out, creating an eerie atmosphere.</p>
