<h1>Chapter 1028: Planning</h1><p>Inner Sanctum.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators who entered the Inner Sanctum this time,</p><p>except those qualified for the trials, all went through the left gate of the Seven Kills Hall with Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>Passing through a long corridor, a point of light appeared ahead.</p><p>An already opened stone gate appeared before everyone.</p><p>Outside the gate was a high platform, with a howling gale blowing, extremely cold and gloomy.</p><p>Surprisingly, in the face of this mere gale, these Yuan Ying cultivators all activated their true essence or activated their protective garments to resist.</p><p>It seemed that the gale here was extraordinary.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi was the first to go outside, standing at the edge of the platform, looking into the distance, the others following one after another.</p><p>At this point, the various factions were still clearly separated.</p><p>The cultivators of the righteous and demonic paths gathered around Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord respectively.</p><p>The people from the three major trading alliances gathered together, the three alliance leaders pointing to the inner hall, secretly communicating through voice transmission.</p><p>Other smaller factions did not approach these three sides, automatically forming their own groups. They were observing the actions of the righteous and demonic paths and the trading alliances, without making any rash moves.</p><p>“A hundred years have passed, and the Inner Sanctum remains unchanged.”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi stood with his hands behind his back, letting out a sigh.</p><p>The high platform they were on was built on a sheer cliff.</p><p>The cliff, smooth as a mirror, only had this one cave and platform as the entrance to the Inner Sanctum.</p><p>Below the cliff was a bottomless abyss, pitch black, with a constant stream of cold wind blowing up, like the wail of ghosts, chilling to the bone.</p><p>Looking around.</p><p>Celestial restrictions floated in the air.</p><p>Ahead lay a thousand mountains and valleys, some places shining with strange lights, unusual sights, ancient ruins, but also hidden dangers.</p><p>But there was no scenic beauty here.</p><p>The entire Inner Sanctum was dark and gloomy, with cold winds sweeping every corner, constant 'whooshing' sounds emanating, and faint black mist everywhere, like ghostly energy.</p><p>Everywhere one looked, there were broken walls and ruins, dried-up rivers, devoid of life, some mountains even completely collapsed, rubble filling the valleys, a desolate scene.</p><p>Coupled with the ever-present dangerous restrictions, the entire Inner Sanctum was like a ghost realm, anyone entering here would instinctively be on high alert.</p><p>“Since the Four Saints discovered the Seven Kills Hall, it has never changed! One day, I will explore all the secrets of the Seven Kills Hall, and see what happened in the ancient cultivation world, leading to the severance of the immortal path for our descendants!”</p><p>The Demon Lord raised an eyebrow, defiant and unruly.</p><p>These words were powerful and resonant.</p><p>Among the Yuan Ying cultivators present, some felt the same way, with sighs heard.</p><p>They were able to stand out in this ruined world, achieving Yuan Ying; in the ancient times, they would certainly have been among the best cultivators, with unlimited potential.</p><p>Especially the two great cultivators, the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>Now, however, due to the unfortunate times, they could not see hope for the immortal path, and did not even dare to hope for the Divine Transformation stage, only able to struggle to survive under the constant threat of heavenly tribulations.</p><p>What difference is there between this and being a corpse in a tomb?</p><p>After leaving these words, the Demon Lord drifted away, and the other Yuan Ying cultivators also came to their senses and began to act.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi sighed slightly and turned to say, “Once the celestial restrictions become unstable, it means the Inner Sanctum is about to close, time is limited, fellow daoists, if you want to do anything, act quickly.”</p><p>Having said this, Ling Zhuzi also led his people away.</p><p>For a moment, streaks of escaping light flew out from the high platform, heading in different directions.</p><p>Among them, the three major trading alliances still did not separate.</p><p>Led by the three alliance leaders, they did not head straight for the depths of the Inner Sanctum, but flew towards the left side of the platform, soon landing on a mountain full of dilapidated buildings.</p><p>After a group of Yuan Ying cultivators left.</p><p>A subtle fluctuation appeared in the celestial restrictions at the top of the cliff. An old woman was hidden in the glow of the restrictions, her gaze sweeping over the Yuan Ying cultivators, then examining the surrounding restrictions.</p><p>“The celestial restrictions here are normal, the restrictions left by my ancestors haven't changed either, why did it appear prematurely...”</p><p>The old woman was full of doubts, tapped her cane, and disappeared.</p><p>On the mountain.</p><p>The cultivators of the three major trading alliances landed.</p><p>Looking up, they could only see the lower half of the mountain, the top was completely shrouded in celestial restrictions, making it impossible to see the scenery inside.</p><p>The others waited in place, and the three alliance leaders quietly approached the edge of the celestial restrictions.</p><p>The red-faced elder, the North Star Alliance Leader, casually set up a barrier, then pinched a hand seal, and after a moment of silence, said, “There's no one around.”</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader nodded and looked up at the top of the mountain, “This is the true location of the trial grounds, hidden within the celestial restrictions. After setting up the formation, we will act separately according to the agreement. I will stay here to unlock the altar hidden in the trial grounds. The two of you should leave quickly and go to other places.  Unlock all the altars as quickly as possible, don't miss the opportunity, success or failure depends on this!”</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader nodded slightly, and the West Profound Alliance Leader remained silent, but did not object.</p><p>Three alliance leaders conferred briefly, then each produced incredibly precious artifacts from their pouches, combining them to set up a peculiar grand formation.</p><p>The formation's location was extremely secretive, completely still and undetectable, its purpose unknown, requiring the combined efforts of the three leaders.</p><p>"Leave this to you, Daoist friend. Let's go,"</p><p>the North Star Alliance Leader said to the West幽 Alliance Leader, leading his people away from the mountain.</p><p>After everyone left, the East Pole Alliance Leader looked up, stared at the celestial barrier for a while, then sat cross-legged on the altar in the center of the formation, closing his eyes in meditation.</p><p>After an indeterminate amount of time,</p><p>the East Pole Alliance Leader abruptly opened his eyes, a glint of light flashing within them.  He raised both hands, his fingers spinning as he rapidly formed hand seals, sending a series of incantations into various parts of the formation.</p><p>‘嗡……’</p><p>The altar gently trembled.</p><p>But the entire formation remained calm, showing no obvious activity. Even someone standing near the mountain would hardly notice anything unusual.</p><p>Finally, the East Pole Alliance Leader activated the formation.</p><p>Immediately, countless dim, unclear circular mirrors seemed to appear within the formation.  In the center of each mirror, a faint, ethereal bluish-green energy flickered, almost like nothingness.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader did not stop, his full attention focused on his incantations.</p><p>The mirrors fluctuated increasingly, the energy within them, like trapped fish, unable to escape the formation’s bounds, began to coalesce toward the center.</p><p>As the East Pole Alliance Leader's incantations neared their end, this energy dramatically changed form, resembling countless sword blades without hilts—ethereal, intangible blades.</p><p>The ethereal blades pointed towards the celestial barrier above, their sharpness evident.</p><p>After this step, the East Pole Alliance Leader paused, visibly strained.  He consumed several spirit pills before continuing his incantations.</p><p>The blades transformed again, their faint bluish-green fading until they became truly invisible, ethereal blades imperceptible to the naked eye.</p><p>"呼!"</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader let out a long sigh.</p><p>Opening his eyes and looking at the floating ethereal blades, a look of satisfaction appeared on his face.  He then took a token from his pouch, holding it firmly without further action.</p><p>The ethereal blades hovered beneath the barrier, motionless.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader seemed to be waiting for a specific moment.</p>
