Chapter 1288: The Great Rout

"Old Demon Ye's entire army is in full retreat?"
Qin Sang's face was filled with astonishment, finding it almost unbelievable.
Back at the Ice Crystal Palace, after much deliberation, everyone had dismissed the risky yet potentially effective strategies, opting instead for the most stable plan.
Everyone knew that completely annihilating the Sin Abyss was impossible.
The plan was to leverage their superior strength to steadily push Old Demon Ye and his forces back to their lair, maintaining peace for a period. The Heavenly Alliance had suffered heavy losses over the years and could not afford any more mistakes. Reclaiming lost territories and recuperating were now the urgent needs of the Heavenly Alliance.
The younger generation of the Cold Domain was thriving, full of vitality, and time was on their side. They were unwilling to take risks, fearing missteps.
Nascent Soul cultivators never plan for the short term.
Qin Sang and Qing Jun dared not hope to conquer Twin Mirror Mountain in a single battle. They planned to wait until Qing Jun fully understood all the intricacies of the Twin Mirror Mountain's grand formation before launching a full-scale attack.
Unexpectedly, Daoist Zhenyi had achieved a stunning victory in a single battle.

"Daoist Zhenyi only sent a brief message; the details are still unclear. It is said that upon learning that Cang Hong Zhenren was at the camp outside Wangdong City, Daoist Zhenyi was certain that after the incident, the Sin Abyss would send reinforcements to both locations. He secretly kept Xiang Qing and other fellow Daoists hidden, not letting them show themselves, but instead lying in ambush along the Sin Abyss's inevitable path. Unexpectedly, they ambushed Old Demon Ye, desperately engaging him until Daoist Zhenyi arrived. After a fierce battle, Old Demon Ye vomited blood in public, causing the Sin Abyss's army to lose morale. Shan and Song were supposed to be with Old Demon Ye, but he had sent them to Twin Mirror Mountain, allowing Daoist Zhenyi to seize this opportunity."
Mirror Lin was ecstatic.
Facing the aggressive Sin Abyss, the Heavenly Alliance had been suppressed for too long, and finally achieved an unprecedented victory.

"Even if Daoist Zhenyi personally intervened, forcing Old Demon Ye to retreat would not be easy, right? Fellow Daoist Xiang Qing engaging Old Demon Ye was even more perilous. How are their injuries?"
Qin Sang asked repeatedly, imagining that the situation must have been extremely brutal.
Old Demon Ye, known as the number one in the North Star Realm, was not a reputation earned lightly.
Mirror Lin's joy faded, hesitating, "Daoist Zhenyi did not mention this, so the losses must be acceptable. By the way, Daoist Zhenyi specifically thanked you in his letter. Old Demon Ye self-destructed his avatar, and the injuries he sustained were far worse than we anticipated!"
"This..."
Qin Sang was speechless, not expecting the aftermath of the Blood Pool battle to still be unfolding, and with such unexpectedly effective results.
Daoist Zhenyi was indeed cunning. He had made his deployment publicly at the Ice Crystal Palace but secretly kept Xiang Qing and others in ambush, even deceiving Qing Jun and himself.
After years of conflict, mutual infiltration was normal.
Now thinking about it, had Daoist Zhenyi sent all the people he suspected to assist him and Qing Jun? Fortunately, when he and Madam Luo switched identities, those around them were trustworthy.
"What does Fellow Daoist Leng say?"
Qin Sang's thoughts shifted, understanding the value of this news. With one camp lost and a disastrous rout, the Sin Abyss's morale would surely waver.
Surely, Twin Mirror Mountain had also received the news!
Qin Sang raised his head, his eyes gleaming with a cold light, his gaze like a sword, seemingly piercing through the grand formation to see the panicked enemy.
...
Twin Mirror Mountain.
After the battle, Immortal Qiu Zhi began planning the retreat, arranging troops, and ordering the inventory of the storerooms, categorizing all resources, taking what could be taken, and destroying what could not.
Just as Twin Mirror Mountain was bustling with activity, an urgent report poured like a bucket of ice water over everyone, chilling them to the bone.
In the grand hall.
Immortal Qiu Zhi and others had grim faces, silent, the atmosphere extremely oppressive, a dead silence.
"With Old Demon Ye personally overseeing, how could there be a rout..."
Fellow Daoist Song kept muttering, unable to accept the fact.
"Enough, what's done is done. I called everyone here to discuss what to do next!"
Immortal Qiu Zhi said coldly.
When she first received the news, her reaction was the same as Fellow Daoist Song's, suspecting it might be a false report. After confirming it, she immediately realized the perilous situation Twin Mirror Mountain was in!
Before she finished speaking, an urgent alarm sounded in the camp.
...
At the same time.
Wangdong City.
This was the Heavenly Alliance's second-largest city after Tianxing City, also a formidable stronghold, with defensive capabilities no less impressive.
The eastern wall of Wangdong City was built on a sheer cliff, straight up and down, with no foothold.
The Heavenly Alliance forces east of Wangdong City had their mountain gates destroyed by the Sin Abyss and were driven here. With Tianxing City behind them, they had no retreat.
As the saying goes, a cornered army fights desperately. The Heavenly Alliance cultivators resisted with their lives. Since the Sin Abyss launched its attack, Wangdong City had remained impregnable, never breached by the Sin Abyss.
Countless shadowy formations floated densely, forming a jade bowl-like light shield, covering Wangdong City.
The city walls were also densely packed with formations, thick black ice integrated with the walls, making them incredibly sturdy.
The hundred-zhang-wide city walls were now crowded with people.
Outside the city, there was also a dense crowd, and one could clearly see towering dark crystal towers among them, carried by low-level cultivators, flying into the air.
The light from the dark crystal towers mixed with the glow of magical treasures and techniques, wildly bombarding Wangdong City.
A fierce battle was raging.
Wangdong City, a rare stronghold in the world, withstood the terrifying attacks like a tide. The city's protective formation and walls shook but showed no signs of breaking, greatly boosting the confidence of the city's cultivators.
Here, unlike the other two locations, it was the Sin Abyss attacking while the two-domain alliance held their ground.
Unbeknownst to them, this battle had been going on for a long time, and the situation had reversed once.
In mid-air.
Cang Hong Zhenren stared fixedly at Wangdong City, unable to hide his anger.
Persuaded by Old Demon Ye, he had decided to retreat.
During this time, he received reports from the other two camps, knowing the two-domain alliance's deployment, so when the Nether Demon Lord and Dongyang Bo came knocking, he did not pay much attention, focusing on preparing for the retreat.
Unexpectedly, the Nether Demon Lord's actions were just a feint. Upon receiving the urgent report of Old Demon Ye's camp being lost and the army in full retreat, Cang Hong Zhenren suddenly realized they had been deceived!
The two-domain alliance had the audacity to divert forces from Wangdong City.
If this stronghold, standing for thousands of years, fell into the hands of the Sin Abyss, they could firmly hold it, threatening the Heavenly Alliance's heartland, and no longer need to consider retreating.
Wangdong City's emptiness was a great opportunity, but Cang Hong Zhenren had been fooled by the Nether Demon Lord, leading to a grave mistake.
In truth, this could not be blamed on Cang Hong Zhenren. The root cause was their excessive trust in Old Demon Ye, the number one in the North Star Realm. Old Demon Ye was not only of high cultivation but also of unparalleled intelligence. No one expected him to fall into a trap.
Even if Twin Mirror Mountain were lost, Cang Hong Zhenren would not be so shocked.
Previously, Cang Hong Zhenren had noticed something unusual about Old Demon Ye but had not anticipated the injuries to be so severe.
Now, capturing Wangdong City was the only chance to turn the tide!
