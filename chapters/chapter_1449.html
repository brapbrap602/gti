<h1>Chapter 1441: Sacred Object Response</h1><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the luminous bridge.</p><p>A woman, walking briskly ahead, led the way with a sweet smile.</p><p>She possessed delicate features and bright, captivating eyes.</p><p>Few would imagine such a beauty was merely a puppet.</p><p>"Senior Sister said that crafting such lifelike puppets isn't easy.  The Demon Assembly must have prepared many; quite a spectacle," Qin Sang mused, listening to the puppet maid's soft explanation of the Demon Assembly's details.</p><p>The island was brightly lit.</p><p>Upon reaching the lake island, Qin Sang saw numerous exquisitely crafted bamboo houses arranged in a circle.</p><p>He noticed that while seemingly close, each house appeared to exist in a separate space, unaffected by the others and shielded from spiritual sense detection—likely due to some kind of spirit array.</p><p>For a moment, neither Qin Sang nor the Sky-Eyed Butterfly could discern the array's intricacies.</p><p>He was once again impressed by the Demon Assembly's grand scale.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the puppet maid into an unoccupied bamboo house and ascended to the second floor.</p><p>The second floor contained only one room, open to the front, though currently shrouded in darkness, revealing nothing.</p><p>The furnishings were simple, just a few bamboo tables and chairs.</p><p>The puppet maid asked if Qin Sang needed anything; the Demon Assembly could fulfill any reasonable request.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, instructing the maid to remain outside.</p><p>He sensed that the Sky-Eyed Butterfly could likely see through some of the restrictions, but it might alert the array's owner, so it was best to avoid unnecessary trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in a bamboo chair, closing his eyes to rest.</p><p>…</p><p>In an unknown room.</p><p>At this time, Elder Lan and Elder Mei of the Xuan Tian Palace were still waiting, their expressions grave, listening to a report from a man in white.</p><p>After a while, Elder Lan nodded slightly.  "You may leave. Proceed as planned, remember to be discreet. I will inform you of any changes."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The man in white left the room.</p><p>Elder Mei rubbed his temples, muttering, "Grand Sage Tian Peng is actually attending the Demon Assembly? The situation on Demon-Infested Island is becoming increasingly complex!"</p><p>Elder Lan also found it quite troublesome.</p><p>Upon receiving this news, his first thought was that trouble had arrived.</p><p>The Hidden Sun Realm and the Demon Realm bordered each other, with constant friction.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace and the demon race had fought countless times, and Grand Sage Tian Peng had always been a major headache, someone they couldn't deal with.</p><p>"That's not surprising. Didn't the Palace Master also participate in the Demon Assembly before? Alas, we still haven't heard from the Grand Elder. It seems he won't be returning. We must be extra cautious."</p><p>Elder Lan sighed.</p><p>"The Palace Master…"</p><p>Elder Mei's expression darkened, about to speak.</p><p>At that moment, an octagonal ice crystal, pure as crystal and pointed at both ends, hanging from Elder Lan's waist, emitted a faint glow, radiating a strange fluctuation.</p><p>The fluctuation was extremely weak, yet it struck the two elders like thunder, causing them to abruptly stand up, their eyes fixed on the trembling octagonal ice.</p><p>The octagonal ice was the ice key Elder Lan had recently refined.</p><p>It could only exist for a few days, so it needed to be re-refined each time.</p><p>The octagonal ice could sense sacred objects.</p><p>For the past few days, the octagonal ice had shown no reaction, and they had almost given up hope.</p><p>"A sacred object!"</p><p>Elder Mei exclaimed in disbelief, never expecting it to be so easy to find.</p><p>"Did that scoundrel really die?  Has the sacred object fallen into someone else's hands? The response is very weak, meaning the person used some kind of restriction to seal it. But they certainly didn't expect this specific type of seal, which cannot be blocked by external force."</p><p>Elder Lan also felt a sense of absurdity; it seemed unreal.</p><p>They had made so many preparations, luring the traitor out, never imagining that the sacred object would appear before them so easily.</p><p>Elder Lan sat cross-legged, holding the octagonal ice in both hands, activating his incantations.</p><p>The octagonal ice shone brightly.</p><p>The entire room, and the two people within, were enveloped in a faint blue light.  The surface of the octagonal ice pulsed with light, accurately indicating the direction of the sacred object.</p><p>"That person is very fast. They've already entered the lake island."</p><p>Elder Lan frowned.</p><p>They had a prior agreement with the Old Man of the Demon-Infested Island: they couldn't act on the island or nearby, to avoid damaging the reputation of the Demon Assembly.</p><p>The trade fair was about to begin, making it even more impossible to act now and reclaim the sacred object.</p><p>Moreover, due to the Demon Assembly's unique arrangements, it was currently impossible to determine who was carrying the treasure.</p><p>Holding the octagonal ice, Elder Lan pondered for a moment, then prepared to send a message to others, changing the plan.</p><p>Just then, Elder Mei frowned, "Wait, could this be a plot by that traitor?"</p><p>Grand Sage Tianpeng appeared.</p><p>Recalling the earlier rumors that lured the Grand Elder away, they couldn't help but suspect something was amiss.</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Lan's joyful expression faded.  "You mean Grand Sage Tianpeng? Impossible! The sacred artifact helps refine the bloodlines of the demon race. That wretch wouldn't dare reveal anything to Grand Sage Tianpeng. Even if the Grand Sage himself can't open the seal, that old demon, Nine-Headed Sage, certainly has a way. If there's really a conspiracy, why would Grand Sage Tianpeng appear openly? Wouldn't it be better to set a trap outside?"</p><p>Elder Mei's expression shifted as he pondered, "That wretch might have known beforehand that Grand Sage Tianpeng would attend the Demon Assembly, deliberately spreading rumors to lure away the Grand Elder, thus dispersing our forces. Then, colluding with some demons, he'd lure us out to execute his plan."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Elder Lan was at a loss for words.</p><p>That wretch, a fugitive, could still plot to this extent; it was simply unbelievable.</p><p>He was more inclined to believe the artifact had fallen into someone else's hands, someone unfamiliar with its origins, thus daring to bring it to the Demon Assembly.</p><p>But Elder Mei's conjecture wasn't impossible.</p><p>Concerning the sacred artifact, excessive caution was warranted.</p><p>"Unfortunately, this is the lair of the Old Demon Hunmo. We can't act on the island. The situation is complex. We can't engage in a chase with them, lest we attract Hunmo and Tianpeng.  We'll act ourselves, strike and retreat! I'll inform Elder Lu immediately; we'll cancel the Yinli Pearl transaction at the trade fair.  Let the younger generation continue as planned, and the Yuan Ying stage cultivators will secretly withdraw from Hunmo Island, sealing off all directions.  With the Ice Key's presence, we need not stay here anymore."</p><p>Elder Lan looked up, speaking rapidly as he formulated a plan.</p><p>Elder Mei hummed in agreement, coldly snorting, "I hope that wretch is already dead. Otherwise, he'll experience the exquisite pain of the Bone-Piercing Needle! This is a large-scale operation; we might lack manpower.  Let's send word to Shi Xue and Liu Li, those two girls; it’s time for them to contribute to the sect."</p><p>Elder Lan hesitated, "Very well. The sacred artifact is about to be recovered; there's no harm in telling them."</p><p>With that, the two elders exchanged a look, their figures flickering, turning into two transparent shadows, silently passing through the wall.</p><p>Two figures remained in the room, seated at the table, their auras indistinguishable from living people, only their skin appearing somewhat transparent.  They seemed to be quietly waiting for news from their subordinates.</p>
