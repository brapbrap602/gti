<h1>Chapter 700:  Dongming Shangren</h1><p>The stout cultivator offered a wry smile.</p><p>“Whether you believe me or not, I truly did not find any useful treasures.</p><p>“The cave abode was in a peculiar location, inside an unnamed cave on an island, created by a senior cultivator with immense power.  The fact that this Transformation Stage beast hide decayed so easily is directly related to that cave.</p><p>“Inside the cave was an unknown, strange, cold mist. Not only was it extremely frigid, but it also possessed a terrifying corrosive power.</p><p>“The cave abode had three levels. Because the cave's restrictions were constantly under assault from the mist, the power of the first two levels was greatly weakened, allowing me to break through.  Because of this, the cave was infiltrated by the mist, and the treasures stored within were completely eroded.</p><p>“Only the restrictions on the third level appeared intact, and the treasures there may have survived.”</p><p>To strengthen his claim, the stout cultivator produced a pill and a talisman, both completely decayed, just like the beast hide.</p><p>The pill had lost all its spiritual essence, only a deformed residue remained, making it impossible to identify its original form.</p><p>The talisman was even more fragile.  When passed around, a female cultivator accidentally tore a corner, and the talisman instantly shattered into countless fragments.</p><p>The female cultivator quickly apologized, but the stout cultivator waved his hand dismissively.  “Even a spiritual talisman couldn't escape this fate.  Can you think of any treasure that could resist such corrosion?”</p><p>“It’s a Guanyang Talisman!”</p><p>The fragments floated like snowflakes into the sea, disappearing with the waves.</p><p>The scholar in green robes stared at this scene, lamenting, “I was lucky enough to see one at an auction in the Inner Sea.  Even Yuan Ying masters competed for it, and it ultimately sold for an astronomical price. Yet this Guanyang Talisman lay unknown in an obscure cave abode, its power lost, eroded into waste paper.  What a pity…”</p><p>Seeing the hide, pill, and Guanyang Talisman, the others now believed the stout cultivator's story to some extent. Unless one found the cave abode of a Yuan Ying master, it was impossible to find so many treasures, all of them decayed.</p><p>At this moment, the thin old man, who had been deep in thought, suddenly spoke. “I remember a Huntian Island master named Dongming Shangren, whose ice-type abilities were incredibly powerful. If what Fellow Daoist Fan said about the cold mist is true, perhaps only Dongming Shangren would dare to build a cave abode there…”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't familiar with the history of Huntian Island.</p><p>The others, having hunted demons on Huntian Island, knew more.</p><p>Hearing the name Dongming Shangren, they showed shock.  Someone anxiously asked the stout cultivator, “Is it truly that senior's cave abode?”</p><p>The stout cultivator shook his head.  “With even the beast hide and the Guanyang Talisman like this, what do you think could have remained? I did see some remnants of jade slips and such in the cave, all without exception, decayed beyond recognition. I searched the entire cave but couldn’t find anything to prove the identity of that senior cultivator.”</p><p>“If it was Dongming Shangren's, then Fellow Daoist Fan's words have some credibility.”</p><p>The thin old man seemed interested, his expression softening, no longer so aggressive.  “Dongming Shangren was very famous; you've all heard of him. But he was the Huntian Island master for the shortest period, and no one knows where he went in the end.  He was also said to be the most reclusive, resulting in a period of chaos on Huntian Island, comparable to now. Perhaps Dongming Shangren only focused on cultivation, which is why he built his cave abode in such an unknown place…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, the thin old man seemed to remember something, and was startled.  “Dongming Shangren left so many treasures in his cave abode, and judging by your description, it's clear he encountered something and couldn't retrieve them. That place… could it be Dongming Shangren's place of death?”</p><p>“That's unlikely.”</p><p>The stout cultivator disagreed with the thin old man's guess.  “But there are certainly treasures in the cave abode that are no worse than the beast hide and the Guanyang Talisman! I’ve said all this, have you all decided whether to go or not?”</p><p>The group exchanged glances, neither readily agreeing nor refusing.</p><p>But Qin Sang could see that they were all tempted.</p><p>He was no exception.</p><p>A Yuan Ying master's cave abode was incredibly rare. With so many treasures inside, its value was certainly no less than the ancient ruins in Xiao Han Domain, not to mention the possibility of a Yuan Ying's remains.</p><p>However, the stout cultivator hadn't revealed enough information to ease their concerns.</p><p>A thin, elderly cultivator stepped forward, a question hanging in the air.  "Daoist Fan invited us to help break the seal," he said. "Surely you don't intend to keep all the treasures for yourself?"</p><p>The stout cultivator sneered. "What?  I discovered the cave and devised the method to break the seal.  I've already promised you payment. You just need to follow my instructions and help crack the final seal.  You think you can get a share of my treasures without lifting a finger?"</p><p>Two female cultivators, also invited by the stout man, were present.</p><p>One, exquisitely made-up, giggled. "Compared to the treasures of a Yuan Ying cultivator, a mere black lizard horn is insignificant.  Besides, Daoist Fan described the cold mist as so dangerous.  Helping you break the seal puts us at considerable risk.  You were so eager to gather us, carefully choosing each of us.  There must be a reason."</p><p>The stout cultivator's face clouded. He snorted coldly.</p><p>"I knew I couldn't hide it from you all...The restrictions left by that senior cultivator served two purposes: to protect the cave and to contain the cold mist, preventing it from spreading. My ignorance led me to unintentionally disturb the mist when I broke the seal, and it's about to burst from the cave. If we wait any longer, the mist will inevitably attract nearby demonic beasts.</p><p>"I'm doing this out of necessity. Otherwise, before my friend returns from the island, the treasures will fall into the hands of the demons.</p><p>"As for your safety in the cave, don't worry. With your strength, you should be able to withstand the cold mist until we break the seal. There are no other dangers inside; the cave's seals are purely protective.</p><p>"And I've never intended, nor have I the ability, to hoard everything.  I don't want to lose my life over some treasures.  However, we have a prior agreement: you can share the treasures, but forget about the previous payment. After breaking the seal, I get first pick, then we divide the rest equally."</p><p>Seeing the stout cultivator's willingness to compromise, the others were less inclined to object.</p><p>A cultivator in a green robe said, "What if there's only one treasure in the cave, Daoist Fan? Will you still keep it all?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The stout cultivator declared firmly. "I've gone through immense hardship.  You're just reaping the rewards. If you don't agree to this condition, I'd rather let the demons have it. The chance of there being only one treasure is minimal, but if it happens, I'll compensate you appropriately."</p>
