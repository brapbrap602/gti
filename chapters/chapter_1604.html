<h1>Chapter 1595: Departure</h1><p>Chapter 1595: Departure</p><p>“A top-grade spirit stone?  Even a super-rich vein might not produce one.  It's been ages since I last heard of one appearing. I've been cultivating for centuries and haven't seen one myself.”</p><p>“Some ancient immortal formations require top-grade spirit stones.”</p><p>“Rumor has it they have other wondrous uses…”</p><p>…</p><p>The Daoist elder’s last remark sparked a flurry of discussion. Top-grade spirit stones garnered even more attention than the Floating Light Silver.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his seat.</p><p>After Jiang You relaxed the restrictions, Qin Sang also diverted a strand of his spiritual sense to examine the Floating Light Silver.  These pieces came from the same vein, intrinsically linked, and could be refined into Xuanji True Silver, incredibly valuable. Any refiner who acquired them would make a fortune.</p><p>However, refining the Floating Light Silver and the subsequent crafting process would consume significant time and energy.</p><p>Qin Sang showed little interest.</p><p>While seemingly examining the silver, his mind was slightly tense.  Since leaving the pool, he'd felt faint, fleeting gazes – someone was secretly watching him, and it wasn't good!</p><p>These individuals were cautious, but Qin Sang's powerful spiritual sense and keen intuition allowed him to perceive them.</p><p>At the Yi Bao Gathering, the Zhen Ling incense he'd presented was unparalleled in value amongst the many treasures.</p><p>Although he'd traded the incense, he'd obtained Near Dragon Saliva, a rare treasure condensed from the essence of five-transformation spirit insects.  Attracting unwanted attention was only natural.</p><p>The Daoist elder, the host of the gathering, was undoubtedly prepared. Wealthy and influential, with a mysterious background, no one would be foolish enough to target him.</p><p>Qin Sang, a lone cultivator, was an easier mark.</p><p>While he wasn’t afraid of a single opponent, a collusion of cunning individuals was a different matter.</p><p>Liu Zhou Hall had promised safety during the gathering.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang stood again.</p><p>Many were already observing him. His movement instantly drew everyone's attention, creating a tense atmosphere.</p><p>Ignoring the others, Qin Sang turned and walked towards the exit.</p><p>Jiang You hastily called out, “Where are you going, friend?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, turning back to say calmly, “I’ve obtained what I desired and intend to return to my cave dwelling to refine it and cultivate.  Does the Hall Master have something to say? Is this place only for entry, not exit?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Jiang You was speechless, glancing at the Daoist elder. He was the true host.</p><p>The Daoist elder pointed to the floating text,  “I require more than this.  I have even more valuable items to offer, including treasures comparable to the Near Dragon Saliva – I assure you. Please stay a while; perhaps we can make further trades…”</p><p>Including Qin Sang, everyone was astonished.</p><p>The Daoist elder possessed incredible wealth!</p><p>Willing to trade so many rare treasures suggested a grand scheme!</p><p>Sharp individuals began to recall recent major events in the cultivation world, trying to discern the elder’s identity and purpose.</p><p>“Your wealth is impressive.  I am in awe. However, having already parted with my Zhen Ling incense, I have little left, and staying would only be troublesome.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s goals were clear. The Near Dragon Saliva would keep him occupied for a while, so he didn’t linger.</p><p>“Very well, the gathering is nearing its end.  Leave if you wish.”</p><p>The Daoist elder watched Qin Sang depart, his eyes flickering as he signaled Jiang You to allow his passage.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed to Jiang You and the elder before disappearing into the shadows of the ancient cypress trees.</p><p>Seeing this, several more people stood.  More followed.</p><p>Some left from other directions, including the nun who acquired the Nine Refinement Return God Pill, content with her gains.</p><p>But several others, intentionally or not, chose the same direction as Qin Sang.</p><p>Most stayed, curious to see what treasures the elder would produce next.</p><p>Entering the cypress forest, Qin Sang sensed fluctuating restrictions.  Ignoring the formations, he followed a specific direction, forging ahead.</p><p>Soon, he felt his body relax, having left the array's range.</p><p>Behind him stretched an endless forest.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto soft grass, surrounded by a small clearing. Across the clearing were rolling hills.  Unbeknownst to him, it was already late at night.</p><p>The sky was moonless, overcast, and pitch black.</p><p>Qin Sang propelled himself forward, leaving a rainbow-like trail.</p><p>Shortly after his departure, two figures emerged from the forest; two armored cultivators.</p><p>“He’s fast!”</p><p>The cultivator in grey armor gazed at the silent mountains in the night, “Don't worry, Brother.  I contacted the third brother with my bloodline ability at the gathering.  He's positioned nearby to intercept him.  Holding him up for a while shouldn't be a problem.”</p><p>Alas!  Too late I received the news. If only I had known about this treasure exchange earlier, I could have called for more help and scored big, giving those scoundrels a real beating!</p><p>At the Elder's request, the meticulously arranged spirit array of the Six States Hall provided effective isolation, preventing attendees from contacting the outside world during the treasure exchange.</p><p>Yet, it failed to block the Grey-armored man's abilities!</p><p>The audacity of this man is astounding.</p><p>"Fool!"</p><p>The Green-armored man snorted coldly. A green light flashed across his face as his armor retracted, revealing the face of a stern young man, appearing to be in his twenties or thirties.  Sharpness and killing intent were evident in his eyes.</p><p>"I sense several powerful auras within. Don't underestimate the humans!" the Green-armored man warned gravely, transforming into a streak of green light and vanishing.</p><p>"With Big Brother here, what's there to fear?"</p><p>The Grey-armored man chuckled, quickly following. He asked doubtfully, "Big Brother, if we're going to strike, why not choose a fat sheep? That guy sounds like a pauper. The Spirit-Subduing Incense is no longer in his possession, and the Dragon's Saliva is risky. We're better off secretly watching that old man and contacting Black Lion and the others. That old geezer has so many treasures, we'll all profit handsomely when we take him down together."</p><p>"Pauper?" The Green-armored man sneered. "Two thousand three hundred years ago, two Spirit-Subduing Incenses appeared. Do you know who ended up with them?"</p><p>"Could it be someone from our clan...?"</p><p>The Grey-armored man was quite sharp and immediately realized something.</p><p>The Green-armored man nodded. "The Spirit-Subduing Incenses appeared in the North Sea, near the Six-legged Demon's lair.  The Six-legged Demon discovered the traces of the monks from the Ganlu Temple, mistaking it for a human attack on its lair, and several battles ensued.  Ultimately, neither side could defeat the other, and they divided the two incenses. The Six-legged Demon intended to present its incense to the Saint King, but it was rejected. Several demon generals in the Saint King's palace know this. The other incense was taken by the Ganlu Temple monks.  If this person is from the Ganlu Temple, why would he use a Spirit-Subduing Incense to exchange for treasures?"</p><p>"This Spirit-Subduing Incense isn't one of the two from that time. Such a rare item wouldn't be everywhere! Could it be… that this person refined it themselves? Humans are unpredictable; they love to take disciples and value their legacies more than their lives. Brother, you suspect this person has inherited a legacy?"</p><p>The Grey-armored man excitedly considered the possibility.</p><p>"Capture him, and we'll find out.  Back then, the Saint King personally confirmed that the Spirit-Subduing Incense has a certain effect even on Nascent Soul cultivators," the Green-armored man said, his voice laced with anticipation and admiration.</p><p>His admiration was for the creator of the Spirit-Subduing Incense.</p><p>Legend has it that this person was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator at the time, yet managed to create such a miraculous medicine. Even if it only had a minimal effect on Nascent Soul cultivators, it was a remarkable achievement.</p><p>It implies that it can aid cultivators in transcending the Nascent Soul Tribulation!</p><p>"Good! Let's go after him! Black Lion and we are not on the same page, and it's difficult to get our hands on the old man's treasures considering his ties to the Six States Hall."</p><p>The Grey-armored man's eyes gleamed, but he remained cautious. "This person is most likely a spiritual cultivator. Spiritual cultivators' abilities are the most unpredictable; I'm afraid…"</p><p>"Have you forgotten my treasure? It perfectly counters spiritual cultivators!"</p><p>The Green-armored man puffed out his cheeks, exhaling a green mist that transformed into a green cloud, enveloping them both, increasing their speed dramatically.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang flew into the mountains, summoning his Phoenix Wings and transforming into a lightning bolt.  Shortly after, he sensed something behind him. Activating his Heavenly Eye ability, he saw a green cloud flying towards him.</p><p>Coldly sneering, Qin Sang didn't slow down; instead, he increased his speed, turning into a lightning bolt that tore through the night sky.</p><p>If the other party continued to pursue him, once they were far from this area, he wouldn't mind giving them a lesson!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he flew over dozens of mountain ranges.</p><p>Even in the most prosperous heartland of the Central Plains, human activity is limited to a small portion, leaving vast stretches of wilderness uninhabited.</p><p>This place was no different.</p><p>Mountains rose and fell, with strange peaks towering.</p><p>In the darkness, the silhouettes of the mountains were oddly shaped, like monstrous beasts about to awaken.</p><p>Not far ahead of Qin Sang, two mountains stood close together, their jutting rocks almost touching. Their outline resembled two tigers rearing up on their front paws; he might as well call it Twin Tiger Mountain.</p><p>As he approached, about to fly over Twin Tiger Mountain, a strange glint flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, a drastic change occurred!</p><p>A blinding white light erupted from the middle of Twin Tiger Mountain.</p><p>The light was brighter than the lightning in the sky, radiating intensely, instantly illuminating the surrounding thousand-zhang mountain range, revealing every detail of the plants, rocks, and debris on the mountain.</p><p>Living creatures, awakened from their slumber by the intense light, let out frightened cries.</p><p>Inside the bright light was a bone.</p><p>Glowing white bones, smooth and warm to the touch, resembled the finest jade.  Delicate blood vessels traced their surface, adding an eerie beauty.</p><p>A brilliant white light flared.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The bones vibrated, emitting a soul-shaking roar from within.</p><p>The earth-shattering cry dispersed the dark clouds.  Countless creatures in the mountains died instantly, terrified to death.</p><p>A shimmering light played on the bones' surface. A ghostly figure emerged—a monstrous, thousand-foot-long crocodile!</p><p>The crocodile's form was ethereal, yet its ferocious aura was enough to intimidate anyone.  It was a terrifying beast of immense power.</p><p>The crocodile swung its massive tail, its head tilted skyward.  Icy, vertical pupils, devoid of reason, held only pure killing intent, fixed on a lightning bolt streaking across the heavens. It lunged.</p><p>The thousand-foot crocodile possessed unbelievable agility.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Though described in detail, it all happened in an instant.  Almost the moment the white light appeared, a thousand-foot crocodile materialized in the void, spanning the sky, its gaping maw unleashing a terrifying sucking force.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>A maniacal laugh echoed through the mountains.</p><p>Shadows writhed, and a figure emerged.</p><p>Another armored warrior, clad in grey.  This one, however, had a short, thick horn protruding from his forehead.</p><p>The horned warrior moved with blinding speed, appearing behind Qin Sang in mid-air.  He raised his fist, aiming for Qin Sang's back, shouting:</p><p>“Get out of here!”</p><p>His armor clattered, revealing corded muscles beneath.</p><p>The mere force of his punch created a supernatural phenomenon—black smoke swirled, forming a black dragon, crashing down with thunderous power!</p><p>A trap!</p><p>The crocodile was too fast, the trap too cunning. Anyone else would have been swallowed whole. Even with a quick reaction, narrowly avoiding the crocodile's jaws, there was no defense against the horned warrior's blow. The outcome would have been the same.</p><p>Unfortunately for the horned warrior, he faced Qin Sang.</p><p>A perfectly laid trap, once discovered by its prey, only backfires on the hunter!</p><p>The horned warrior delivered his punch with confidence.</p><p>The black dragon and the thousand-foot crocodile faced off in mid-air, two monstrous beasts seemingly locked in a standoff.  The escaping figure between them looked incredibly small and fragile.</p><p>However, the scene the horned warrior envisioned didn't unfold.</p><p>As if anticipating the attack, the escaping figure abruptly stopped at the edge of the crocodile's massive jaws, then retreated without hesitation.</p><p>Immense suction erupted from the crocodile's mouth, creating a visible vortex in the void that rapidly spread, but could only chase after the afterimages of the fleeing figure.</p><p>This, however, only evaded the first trap.</p><p>The punch followed.</p><p>A crisis of simultaneous attack from front and rear.</p><p>Sensing the danger from behind, Qin Sang remained calm, forming a Buddhist hand seal, his feet seemingly treading on lotuses. He executed the Lotus Seal of the Seven Masters' Imprint, shifting his body with unbelievable dexterity to narrowly avoid the dragon's head.</p><p>The dragon's force had not yet dissipated.</p><p>Without summoning a weapon, Qin Sang casually struck out with his right hand, shattering the dragon's tail with sheer physical strength, leaving the horned warrior astounded.</p><p>Easily neutralizing the trap, Qin Sang coldly looked at the horned warrior.</p><p>Meeting Qin Sang's icy gaze, the horned warrior felt a sudden, chilling premonition.  A cold wave surged from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head, freezing him to the bone.</p><p>Trusting his instincts, the horned warrior immediately urged the crocodile to continue its pursuit, abandoning any thought of further attacking Qin Sang, and retreated swiftly.</p><p>As he moved, darkness enveloped the horned warrior.  He was horrified to discover that sharp sword threads had materialized in the void, surrounding him from all directions.</p><p>Before flying over Double Tiger Mountain, Qin Sang had sensed the enemy.  Their camouflage was impeccable. The crocodile bones remained hidden, and Qin Sang's spiritual sense only reacted upon close proximity, but it failed to deceive the eyes of his Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, confirming the ambushers weren't high-level cultivators. He charged forward, secretly deploying the Golden Submersion Sword, preparing a sword array, using their plan against them.</p><p>…</p><p>The sword array filled the sky.</p><p>The horned warrior suddenly disappeared, his aura sealed by the sword array. His fate was uncertain.</p><p>High in the clouds, the blue-armored and grey-armored warriors witnessed the scene from afar, their faces changing.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>The blue-armored warrior glowed with blue light. Two streams of blue energy flowed across his armor like fish, before his aura surged, transforming into a blue streak tearing through the air with a piercing sound.</p><p>Leaving only an afterimage behind.</p>
