<h1>Chapter 1900 A Hundred Years</h1><p>Spring is in the air.</p><p>Fish leap, kites fly.</p><p>Qin Sang takes a deep breath, the fresh air filling his lungs.  There’s no miasma here!</p><p>The world’s vital energy is stable, and far more abundant than in the Storm World.</p><p>The Great Thousand World!</p><p>Finally, he no longer needs to constantly worry about the chaotic Heavenly Dao, no longer needs to rely on the protective altar for survival.</p><p>This means he has escaped the range of the River of Filth.</p><p>Qin Sang looks around.  The water shimmers, a vast expanse of blue, with no sign of the River of Filth. The mysterious person and their boat have vanished without a trace.</p><p>“How does the River of Filth manifest in the Great Thousand World? A black river? A boundless black mist? Or some unknown, hidden place? Am I on its bank, or have I been transported somewhere specific?”</p><p>Qin Sang wonders where he’s been taken, completely unaware of how the mysterious person left.</p><p>No one can answer his questions.  The First Sword Servant and the Sword Spirit never mentioned anything like this.</p><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly begins to cough violently, a stabbing pain racking his body.</p><p>The power of the Inner Lion Seal is fading, worsening his injuries.  His body feels drained, and he’s struggling to maintain the protective altar. An intense weakness washes over him, almost causing him to fall into the water.</p><p>Zhu Que flies out, a surge of crimson fire enveloping her as she catches Qin Sang.</p><p>“Find a nearby deserted island…”</p><p>Qin Sang gasps.</p><p>The urgent priority is to heal and stabilize Lei Zu.  He doesn't need a particularly good spiritual vein, just a safe cave for quiet cultivation.</p><p>Good spiritual veins, in both the Small and Great Thousand Worlds, are likely already claimed.</p><p>Qin Sang needs to avoid contact with cultivators as much as possible.  The Great Thousand World is vast, and many are searching for the Purple Star Emperor Sword and the Purple Star Emperor's heir.</p><p>The scenery is unchanging in every direction. Zhu Que picks a random direction and flies low over the water.</p><p>Newly reborn, she struggles slightly, her small wings flapping as she carries Qin Sang. This doesn’t stop her from complaining.</p><p>“With you, it's either being chased or attacked!”</p><p>“Don’t you dare die on me…”</p><p>“Wait till I’m grown and can protect myself before you die!”</p><p>…</p><p>As the Inner Lion Seal’s power fades, Qin Sang’s life force ebbs away.  At first, he thinks this little bird has had a change of heart, but soon he’s almost amused by her complaints.</p><p>They proceed cautiously, the Sky-Eye Butterfly scouting ahead, Zhu Que slowing their speed. After only a stick of incense, the Sky-Eye Butterfly sends a mental message: land is sighted.</p><p>Moments later, a series of undulating shapes appear on the horizon.</p><p>“Island or mainland?”</p><p>Unsure if he’s in the ocean or a lake, Qin Sang’s expression shifts. “I sense cultivators. It seems the strongest is only at the Golden Core stage…”</p><p>Zhu Que sets Qin Sang down on a reef. The Sky-Eye Butterfly vanishes, flying towards the land alone.</p><p>The butterfly flits, its observations transmitted to Qin Sang.</p><p>There are clearly people here.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly reaches the shore, spotting several fishing boats tied to the bank – not the kind built to withstand ocean storms.</p><p>Then, it spots wisps of smoke. A village of over a hundred houses nestles at the foot of a mountain, surrounded by cultivated fields.</p><p>Evening approaches. Villagers leave the fields, hoes over their shoulders, walking along the paths.</p><p>Some chat and stroll leisurely; others hurry home, their stomachs rumbling.</p><p>A peaceful and harmonious scene.</p><p>These villagers are indistinguishable from those in the Storm World, but they are healthy and rosy-cheeked. While not wealthy, they seem to have enough to eat.</p><p>Unseen, a colorful butterfly lightly passes over the village and flies to the mountaintop, ascending to a great height.</p><p>If this is an island, it’s one comparable to a continent.</p><p>In the distance, mountains rise and fall, stretching endlessly.  Paths and villages are visible.  One might say there's a village every ten li, a city every hundred.  The roads are straight and wide; there are no bandits. Even as night falls, merchants still travel.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly pauses, then continues, crossing mountains and valleys, until it reaches a mountain.</p><p>It’s not a spectacular peak, but it gathers countless spiritual essences, a place rich in spiritual energy, ideal for cultivation.</p><p>The cultivator’s aura Qin Sang sensed originates from this mountain.</p><p>A Daoist temple, called the Smoke and Water Temple, sits on the mountain, divided into front and back sections, a common layout for many temples.</p><p>The front welcomes ordinary devotees, bustling with incense offerings.  The mountain path is constantly filled with people.</p><p>The back mountain is forbidden, a place of cultivation.</p><p>A butterfly, its eyes like polished jade, silently flew into the Daoist temple. It discovered a protective formation shielding the mountain behind the temple from the mundane world.  The formation, however, was weak, riddled with flaws easily spotted by Qin Sang and the jade-eyed butterfly.</p><p>Instead of rushing in, the butterfly landed on a rock, activating its unique vision. After careful confirmation, it determined that the strongest cultivator within the temple was only a late Golden Core stage practitioner.  The location of this cultivator's private chamber indicated their highest status within the Yan Shui Temple.</p><p>Night shrouded the land in a hazy darkness.</p><p>The butterfly paused briefly, then continued its exploration before returning to the rock.</p><p>“There are other cultivators nearby, but mostly scattered individuals. The one in the temple is the strongest; a late Golden Core cultivator capable of holding this Daoist estate. The temple’s ancient architecture suggests it has stood for years without suffering war, making it a quiet place for recuperation…”</p><p>Qin Sang made a decision, ordering Zhu Que and the jade-eyed butterfly to take him to the Yan Shui Temple.</p><p>Upon reaching land, they remained cautious. Qin Sang had sensed the presence of deities in this world; the mortal cities all had City God temples. These temples were bustling, clearly emitting faint traces of supernatural energy, though not strong. The same was true for Earth God and Mountain God temples, though not every mountain had a Mountain God; the range surrounding the Yan Shui Temple was devoid of one.</p><p>The scene was reminiscent of his arrival in the Fu Ling Realm, but without the rampaging beasts.  Unsure of the strength of the deities in this vast world, Qin Sang maintained his caution, avoiding contact.</p><p>Reaching the Yan Shui Temple, Qin Sang, without alarming anyone, quietly passed through the formation.  He chose a secluded mountain wall in the rear and created a cave dwelling, establishing protective formations and settling in.</p><p>…</p><p>The cave was sparsely furnished. Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a stone bed, his eyes closed. The jade-eyed butterfly rested on his left shoulder. Zhu Que lay curled on his right, resembling a ball of fire, fast asleep.</p><p>The First Sword Servant had imbued Zhu Que with a spirit, essentially rebuilding its foundation. To regain its former strength and "grow," Zhu Que needed to solidify this foundation.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed his jade altar.  Within resided two demons, Gui Hou and Luo Hou, and a fire jade centipede.  Intending to repair the Taiyi Star Chariot, he had brought the two demon lords with him when leaving Sword Heart Island to revisit Ju Mountain and tend to his altar.</p><p>During the descent of the Thunder Ancestor, they had suffered far less than Qin Sang. Perhaps due to the Thunder Ancestor's impact on the altar, disrupting its inner essence and shaking its foundation, their state was even worse than the jade-eyed butterfly's; they remained unconscious, their condition unknown.</p><p>Looking at the two demon lords, Qin Sang fell into contemplation. His identity must remain secret, yet he had used the Seven Souls Killing Formation and the Cloud Touring Sword in public more than once, including when he captured these two.</p><p>In the previous realm, the Fu Ling Realm, many cultivators and demon cultivators witnessed his swordsmanship; the Daoist sects surely had plans accordingly.  These two demon lords were his responsibility alone.</p><p>Their lives were in his hands.  He had made promises to them, so killing them wasn't an option. Keeping them would ensure their loyalty; they would not escape his control.  Though he had reached the Void Refinement stage, his foundation was shaky, and prolonged seclusion was necessary.  He needed reliable servants.  For safety, he would erase their memories after restoring his cultivation.</p><p>“I wonder what the Court will do with Daoist Mo…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought of Mo Xing Dao, lamenting that their agreement could not be fulfilled.  The Daoist Court would bring Mo Xing Dao into this vast world, but it wasn't what Mo Xing Dao wanted. While the Court likely wouldn't indiscriminately kill innocents, they might not release him, perhaps offering him another path.</p><p>Preoccupied with his own safety, Qin Sang couldn't worry about others. He suppressed his thoughts, checking his injuries.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>A dozen jade bottles floated before Qin Sang, opening one after another, releasing pills which he swallowed.  Having suffered the consequences of the Lion Seal's power dissipating, Qin Sang was prepared. These pills would help stabilize his injuries and prevent worsening.</p><p>After absorbing the medicinal power, Qin Sang retrieved the black demonic roc's corpse.</p><p>‘Puff!’</p><p>Upon removal, the smell of burnt flesh, as if struck by lightning, filled the cave. Qin Sang waved his sleeve, clearing the foul odor before examining the corpse.</p><p>The roc was blackened, its flesh damaged, but the remaining bones, flesh, and demonic core were invaluable.  It seemed the roc’s treasures had been destroyed by the lightning. Just as Qin Sang felt disappointment, he noticed something in its abdomen.  He opened it, finding a coral pearl.</p><p>"It's a mustard seed-type artifact!"</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced. After much research, he finally broke the seal on the coral orb.</p><p>As expected, it contained the demonic peng's many years of collection, including many rare healing elixirs.</p><p>This is exactly what Qin Sang needed. He put away the other treasures, keeping only the pills, making him more confident in his recovery.</p><p>The residual snake venom in his body was no longer a threat.  He suppressed it, intending to use it for body refinement.</p><p>Once his injuries improved slightly, Qin Sang summoned the altar to check on the guardian deity.</p><p>Even with the Five Thunder Envoy Seal protecting the altar, the Lei Zu apparition showed signs of significant unrest.  The seal alone was barely able to maintain control.</p><p>Although the Lei Zu apparition hadn't completely lost control, its unstable state couldn't fully mask the aura of the Earth-Slaying Sword.  It would be obvious to a powerful cultivator. Fortunately, the mysterious person didn't leave him behind because of the Yin-Yang chess pieces.</p><p>He needed to wait until the Lei Zu apparition stabilized before venturing out.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a meditative state, examining the Five Thunder Envoy Seal and sensing the Lei Zu apparition.</p><p>"Hiss! This seal actually contains a legacy of thunder techniques!"</p><p>Qin Sang was both surprised and delighted. He hadn't expected the Five Thunder Envoy Seal to be more than a symbol of status; it contained various thunder techniques and, most importantly, thunder talismans!</p><p>Summoning God Thunder Talisman, Illuminating Golden Village,  Universal Command Talisman,  Supplementing Clouds and Making Rain Technique,  Controlling the Heavenly Emperor Incantation…</p><p>Qin Sang was almost lost in the vastness of the thunder techniques, repeatedly marveling at the profound depth of the Daoist tradition and the sophistication of thunder techniques.</p><p>He practiced the High Supreme Shenxiao technique, but he hadn't received a true lineage; he only learned three thunder talismans, including the Five Thunder Heart-Correcting Seal.</p><p>These talismans perfectly compensated for his deficiencies in thunder techniques.</p><p>"Zhang Tianshi has given me a great gift!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>His cultivation had advanced too rapidly.  The *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique hadn't caught up, rendering many of his abilities ineffective against cultivators at the Transcending Void stage.</p><p>He couldn't use the Cloud-Traveling Sword or the Seven Souls Killing Formation; it was like losing an arm.</p><p>He wouldn't change his cultivation technique, but he could choose some thunder talismans to cultivate, as his primary means of combat in the future.</p><p>Without delving into the thunder techniques immediately, Qin Sang used the Five Thunder Envoy Seal to perceive the Lei Zu apparition.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"The connection with the Divine Court has been severed…"</p><p>He couldn't sense the Divine Court, nor the Supreme Heavenly Origin Thunder Sound Universalizing Heavenly Venerable.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the connection was truly broken or if his cultivation was insufficient.</p><p>"The Daoist scriptures say that Daoist cultivators can summon deities and ward off evil spirits even when traveling; is that an exaggeration?  Could something have happened to the Divine Court?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but worry. The Daoist sect was their ally, and he certainly didn't want to see them suffer.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the loss of contact would affect his guardian deity, but there were many obvious negative consequences.</p><p>The Great Thousand World was vast and boundless.</p><p>He couldn't determine the Divine Court's location, and therefore didn't know where Zhang Tianshi would establish his Daoist temple.</p><p>Even after stabilizing the Lei Zu apparition, Qin Sang wouldn't be able to seek refuge, adrift like a rootless duckweed in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Furthermore, most of the talisman techniques in the Five Thunder Envoy Seal were related to summoning and controlling thunder deities; these talismans would become unusable.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, dismissing his worries.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang confirmed that with the help of the Five Thunder Envoy Seal, stabilizing the Lei Zu apparition wasn't difficult; it just required a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>Spring came and winter went.</p><p>The seasons changed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a century had passed.</p><p>The moss on the mountain wall was thicker, the base piled high with fallen leaves, and weeds grew wildly.</p><p>Few people ever came to this place.  Over the century, Yan Shui Temple welcomed several new disciples, and some accomplished disciples went down the mountain to hone their skills, but none discovered the hidden world behind the wall.</p><p>In those hundred years, Qin Sang only woke up once, twenty years ago.</p><p>On that day,</p><p>The Yan Shui Temple master's cultivation reached the peak of the Golden Core stage. After years of refinement, he decided to attempt a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang was awakened by the fluctuations of spiritual energy, and through the mountain wall, he saw a quiet room in the temple.</p><p>Unfortunately, the spiritual energy phenomenon only lasted a quarter of an hour before disappearing, failing to attract a heavenly tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, sighing softly, and resumed his meditation.</p><p>This was the 105th year since he entered the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Inside the mountain wall.</p><p>Qin Sang had carved out another chamber outside his own, as living spaces for Luo Hou and Gui Hou.</p><p>And Qin Sang's cave had an additional bed.</p><p>A young girl lay on the bed; she was the spirit of the Five Elements Crown, asleep until now.</p><p>A vermilion bird nestled beside the girl, also fast asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, motionless for a long time.</p><p>At this moment, the altar floated before him.  The guardian deity, the Lei Zu apparition, was clearly more distinct and solid.</p><p>‘Crackle…'</p><p>The cave was filled with thunder, but it was isolated by the protective barrier and didn't disturb the temple cultivators.</p><p>Suddenly, the altar erupted in blinding lightning, which quickly retracted into the altar. The Lei Zu apparition, holding an imperial edict and the Five Thunder Envoy Seal, sat firmly on the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke leisurely, gazing at the altar and nodded silently.</p><p>"It should be foolproof now!"
