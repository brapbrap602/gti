<h1>Chapter 2252: The War Begins</h1><p>A young bull is not afraid of a tiger.</p><p>The young man, already fearless from harvesting herbs on sheer cliffs, was greatly encouraged. He climbed the near-vertical cliff, using both hands and feet. He ate his dried provisions when hungry, rested against tree branches when tired, his only fear being that Qin Sang would leave.  He would occasionally look up at her.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently waited for him.</p><p>The youth's physique was indeed strong; he actually managed to climb to near the summit using only his hands and feet. Near the top was a smooth rock face with only a few thin vines hanging down.</p><p>The young man rested for a while, grabbed the vines, and kicked off the rock face, swinging in the air, trying to fling himself to the top.</p><p>His courage and determination were truly rare. Qin Sang secretly admired him and subtly helped him.</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>The young man landed before Qin Sang, just an inch from the cliff edge. He showed no fear, his face overflowing with joy and excitement.</p><p>"Disciple Che Fei Long greets his Master!"</p><p>The young man immediately knelt to kowtow, but his head was held up by a force, preventing him from bowing.</p><p>"I will not take on a disciple, and you should not call me Master. Call me senior."</p><p>Qin Sang said不容置疑, "I can teach you magic. In exchange, you must stay here and wait for someone."</p><p>From that day on, the townspeople noticed a thick fog suddenly enveloping the western hillside.</p><p>The dense fog covered half the mountain, engulfing the old Ning family residence.</p><p>Initially, people thought it was just morning mist, but after more than ten days, the fog showed no sign of dissipating.  Curious, some ventured up the mountain. Entering the fog was like encountering a ghost, and they only managed to escape after becoming dizzy and faint from hunger.</p><p>After the story spread, the Ning family massacre was again brought up, with people saying it was the vengeful spirits, causing widespread fear. No one dared approach the area again.</p><p>In reality, Qin Sang had created a cave dwelling in the old Ning family residence, and Che Fei Long, having received teachings, practiced there, guarding the stone pavilion.</p><p>…</p><p>Not long after Liu Chengping left, the head of the Dong Liang sect paid a visit.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of his secret being exposed, choosing to receive the Dong Liang sect leader atop Mount Yuji.  Actually, the large formation on Mount Yuji was extremely well-hidden; otherwise, it wouldn't have remained undiscovered for so many years.</p><p>He personally brewed spiritual tea, gesturing for Sect Leader Qi to try it. "Sect Leader Qi, it's not that I intentionally interfered in your sect's territory.  Years ago, I and Mr. Ning were close friends, and Mr. Ning didn't know my true identity.  Though Mr. Ning was a mortal, we had delightful conversations and considered each other lifelong friends!  Returning from seclusion, I recalled the past and calculated that my old friend had reached the end of his life. I originally came only to pay my respects, but unexpectedly, the Ning family was annihilated.  In terms of both sentiment and reason, I must avenge my old friend. Sect Leader Qi, do you agree?"</p><p>Sect Leader Qi had no heart for tea. His purpose was to probe Qin Sang's intentions – whether he was genuinely helping a friend or had ulterior motives.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's sincerity, Sect Leader Qi felt slightly reassured. "Daoist Qingfeng, your righteousness is admirable!  Our Dong Liang sect will do everything we can to find the culprit and will show no mercy!"</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, then said to someone beside him, "Fei Long, come here."</p><p>"Fei Long greets both seniors," Che Fei Long respectfully bowed. He had been personally trained by Qin Sang and had already entered the path of cultivation in just a few days.</p><p>Noticing Sect Leader Qi's curious gaze, Qin Sang explained, "The Ning family has no heir, and their lineage is broken. Fei Long and I share a connection, so I've taught him some spells, and he will guard the Ning family tomb. Also, if any Ning family descendants are still alive and come to pay their respects, he can guide them back to the mountain. I hope Sect Leader Qi will be accommodating."</p><p>This was Dong Liang sect territory, and Qin Sang didn't want conflict. This allowed him to legitimately occupy Mount Yuji.</p><p>A small town and a few mountains were insignificant to the Dong Liang sect.  Moreover, this wasn't even the heartland of the Dong Liang sect.  Sect Leader Qi hesitated for a moment before agreeing.</p><p>Having personally seen Qin Sang and confirmed he wasn't targeting the Dong Liang sect, Sect Leader Qi felt relieved and returned to order his disciples to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p><p>Soon after, Liu Chengping and other Dong Liang sect cultivators came to Mount Yuji to see Qin Sang. Behind them was a magic vessel, with a chaotic mix of auras suggesting numerous people onboard.</p><p>"Wait here."</p><p>Liu Chengping instructed the vessel, then flew to the summit with an elder.</p><p>Senior Qingfeng!”</p><p>Two figures bowed deeply.  “We have largely uncovered the truth behind the Ning family tragedy. All the evidence and clues are here for your inspection!”</p><p>With a wave of their hands, more disciples from the Dongliang Sect carried wooden chests onto the platform.</p><p>The chests contained gold, silver, jewels, and documents—carefully organized and categorized by time.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to examine the contents while listening to Liu Chengping recount their findings.</p><p>“Mr. Ning was appointed to a government post in the capital. Three years later, he abruptly resigned and moved his entire family to Dangyang Prefecture. For several years, he remained in Dangyang, never leaving, until the tragedy struck, and his entire family was murdered. The following year, a new prefect, Fu Qiyu, arrived in Dangyang.  Upon his arrival, he began training the prefectural army and launched a large-scale crackdown on bandits…”</p><p>“Although Fu Qiyu is now deceased, some traces remain. The evidence shows his appointment to Dangyang was not straightforward; it was orchestrated by the then-Grand Minister, Lu Jiang!”</p><p>“Our investigation reveals that while in the capital, Mr. Ning clashed with Grand Minister Lu Jiang over political differences, becoming disillusioned and resigning. However, even in retirement, he remained concerned about the affairs of the state and repeatedly submitted memorials, many criticizing government policies.  The emperor at the time was weak, and Lu Jiang controlled the court, so these memorials all fell into his hands.  These memorials were burned, and we haven't found them, but Lu Jiang's descendants have corroborated the events…</p><p>“So much time has passed, and all the principals are deceased, making it difficult to reconstruct the complete picture. However, we can deduce that Mr. Ning angered Lu Jiang, resulting in his demise. Lu Jiang ordered his subordinates to hire bandits, and after the bandits committed the crime, he dispatched Fu Qiyu to eliminate them, silencing witnesses!”</p><p>Liu Chengping finished his explanation.  Every point was supported by evidence; any uncertainties were addressed with testimony, creating a coherent narrative.</p><p>The Dongliang Sect breathed a collective sigh of relief.  It was a purely earthly political struggle, with no cultivators involved behind the scenes.</p><p>At least there was no risk of the Dongliang Sect being implicated.</p><p>“Bring them in!”</p><p>Liu Chengping turned and addressed the disciples on the flying boat.</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>Qin Sang swept his sleeve, a gust of wind sending the chests tumbling down the mountain.  “Now that the culprit has been identified, deal with those implicated according to the law!”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>Liu Chengping, understanding the implied dismissal, bowed and prepared to leave. Before departing, he said, “The bandits responsible have been eliminated, and contemporary witnesses are all deceased. The remains of the Ning family were burned to ashes, preventing a full reconstruction of that night’s events. It's uncertain if anyone else was present, or if any Ning family members survived and were taken away.  Rest assured, we will continue our search.  We will find the Ning family descendants, even if we have to search every inch of the ground!”</p><p>Having spoken, Liu Chengping retreated beyond the mountain, back to the flying boat.</p><p>The boat shuddered slightly, then turned and departed.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed out at the mountain, his expression somber, precisely the outcome he least wanted to see.</p><p>The massacre was simply the result of earthly grievances, with no cultivators involved. This meant that Liuli’s entry into the illusory realm was merely a ‘normal’ accident.</p><p>And such accidents were common and difficult to prevent.</p><p>If he hadn’t encountered the Transcendent Elder, before he had the power to protect himself, if his parents had inadvertently offended a powerful person in their city or had a quarrel with a violent villager, it could have easily resulted in their deaths.</p><p>If…</p><p>Would Liuli be reborn again?</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly; a hard-won lead had gone cold.</p><p>Qin Sang then continued his cultivation on the Jade Machine Mountain bridge, awaiting news from the Dongliang Sect and considering his options.</p><p>One evening…</p><p>Qin Sang went to the mountaintop as usual, using the array flags to shield the celestial phenomena and practicing the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>For years, every few days, he had used this technique to sense the stars, waiting for the call to reappear.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, adjusting his qi, as the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* had reached a bottleneck.  Further progress would produce a true Dharma form; he dared not rashly break through, so he only circulated his qi a few times each session.</p><p>The stars were as brilliant as always.</p><p>The starlight above Qin Sang shimmered, as if drawn, pouring down.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's expression changed.  After many years, he finally ‘heard’ the voice from deep space again!</p><p>The voice was fainter, but Qin Sang’s cultivation had improved, allowing him to discern some words—it was the same call, meaning it was still the same being!</p><p>However, Qin Sang was most concerned with himself.  In the call, the Dharma form shadow did not react, putting his mind somewhat at ease.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to open his storage device, retrieve his pre-prepared formations, and set up defensive barriers to protect himself during communication.  However, he hesitated.</p><p>He realized the other party might be a powerful cultivator from the Qingluan clan, possessing the formidable power of "Soul Integration with Stars". To communicate effectively, he should disguise himself as a Qingluan cultivator.  The problem was, he was currently within human territory.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the other party, located high above, could see the ground below.  If questioned, explaining his presence would be difficult.</p><p>"I'd better visit the front lines again…" he mused, instantly appearing at the Ning family's old residence.</p><p>Che Feilong, who was cultivating, sensed Qin Sang's arrival. He quickly opened the door, bowing deeply, "Greetings, senior."</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I'll be away for a while. Guard this place alone. If you encounter trouble, crush this jade talisman; the Dong Liang sect will send help."</p><p>"I will certainly fulfill my duty!" Che Feilong replied solemnly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, gazed deeply at the stone pavilion, and vanished.</p><p>Before his departure, Qin Sang informed the Dong Liang sect.  Their reply brought unexpected news.</p><p>"War has begun?"</p><p>Qin Sang, reading the intelligence from the Dong Liang sect, looked surprised. When he returned from the Jinying tribe, the situation was relatively calm. He hadn't expected war to break out so quickly.</p><p>There had been skirmishes before, but they were localized, both sides exercising restraint, unwilling to escalate the conflict.  This time was different.  Multiple battlefronts ignited almost simultaneously. Yongtu City issued orders, mobilizing all sects and factions, all human cultivators and descendants of gods, to defend the city against the foreign invasion!</p><p>This was a matter of great righteousness, unavoidable for any human sect. The Dong Liang sect was fully preparing for war.  Although Yongtu City and the Feng clan hadn't officially declared war, it was clear to everyone that war was imminent!</p><p>"Finally!"</p><p>Qin Sang clenched the message, muttering to himself. He had been waiting for this day. He believed escaping this illusion required either discovering unusual aspects within it—like the call from deep space—or a cataclysmic change within the illusion itself, providing an opportunity.</p><p>The war between humans and demons was the perfect opportunity!</p><p>This illusion was so perfect, so real. Qin Sang had lived here for decades, almost believing it was the real world.  It wouldn't have simulated this era without reason; the curtain was finally rising!</p><p>With two opportunities to break free now available, he had to seize them.  He increased his speed, heading straight for Yongtu City.</p><p>He held a position there and was assigned a temporary cave dwelling. Upon returning, he found a message from Yuanjing Mountain.</p><p>It was from his senior sister Qinghong.  Senior Zhou, and his senior brother Qingyan, had also received orders and were already at the front.</p><p>With the war underway, Tianjing Sect would no longer target Yuanjing Mountain. Qinghong reassured Qin Sang that the sect had returned to normal.  Qin Sang and Qingyan's participation in the war was sufficient; the master Tongshen could remain at the mountain to focus on his breakthrough.</p><p>After a short rest, Qin Sang rejoined his unit.  His rapidly advancing cultivation had drawn attention; the city sent a high-ranking Immortal Guard commander to meet him. His exceptional speed had caught the eye of the city's leaders, who wanted to cultivate him as an elite.</p><p>The commander frankly stated that losing such a talent as Qin Sang would be a great loss to Yongtu City and even humanity.</p><p>Qin Sang, though anticipating this, remained adamant, determined to go to the front lines. He insisted his rapid cultivation was due to rigorous training; otherwise, he'd be just an ordinary cultivator.</p><p>The commander, unable to dissuade him, relented but forbade Qin Sang from undertaking any undercover missions behind enemy lines. He arranged for Qin Sang to be stationed at a less intense battlefront, promising to provide any resources he needed during cultivation.</p><p>War brings disaster, but also opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang boarded a spirit boat and set off for the front lines. The fighting was concentrated at the front; the rear was relatively safe, and he arrived without incident.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang found an excuse to leave the city and entered territory controlled by the demon clan.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Today's update will be later.</p>
