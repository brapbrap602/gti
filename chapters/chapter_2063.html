<h1>Chapter 2054: Closing the Net</h1><p>Having learned the nature of the Siyou Clan's divine abilities, the Yi Ren Clan's plan became clear.</p><p>Because the Siyou Clan and their companion beasts share a deep connection, and can dispel these beasts at will, capturing the beasts beforehand was impractical. It would only alert them.  They had to wait until the Siyou themselves initiated the Soul Exchange Technique before acting.</p><p>Therefore, they had to divide their forces. One group would remain here, while the other would pressure the two Siyou Clan members. Of course, if the Siyou refused to use the Soul Exchange and chose to engage in a protracted battle, the Yi Ren Clan would be happy to oblige.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu exchanged a glance. The Yi Ren Clan experts splitting up was undoubtedly advantageous to them.</p><p>However, with the situation unfolding so rapidly, many of Su Nu's preparations couldn't be utilized. Where to start and when to strike required careful consideration.</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved slightly, transmitting his thoughts.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes flashed. "Brother Qin suggests we remain here, await the Siyou Clan's Soul Exchange, and seize them directly? But what if they are wary and don't use the exchange, choosing instead to break through with all their might from another direction? Or what if they fall before they can even use the technique?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "This is a necessary risk.  With only the two of us, our strength is limited.  If we split up, we're likely to fail on both fronts.  It's better to focus on one. The Quanfeng Clan's cautious approach suggests the two Siyou are formidable and won't be easily defeated. If they manage to escape again, we simply continue monitoring the Quanfeng Clan's movements. There will be other opportunities."</p><p>There was another consideration. By staying together, they could support each other in case of danger.  Rescuing the Siyou was only to gain a guide.  Putting themselves in extreme peril would not be worth it.</p><p>Su Nu grasped the key points and nodded. "As Brother Qin says."</p><p>With that, she cast a few more spells on Ji Chou, and together with Qin Sang, they vanished without a trace.</p><p>Shortly after their departure, Ji Chou awoke as if from a dream.  His dull gaze gradually cleared, freed from the spell's influence.</p><p>However, he had no memory of the previous events, as if that period had been erased.  He only remembered bidding farewell to his two clansmen and arriving here without incident.</p><p>His purpose wasn't to refine any protective treasure, but to seek a special kind of crystal.</p><p>Soon after his arrival, he had discovered these crystals, which greatly benefited Quanfeng Clan cultivation.  Fearing other clansmen might covet them and force him to share, he refrained from collecting them immediately. Fortunately, the crystals were hidden beneath the reefs, their aura masked by the spirit veins, making them very difficult to detect. He could find another opportunity to extract them later.</p><p>As he learned more during this time, Ji Chou realized a major conflict was likely brewing, and worried it would destroy this place. He had found an excuse to slip away.</p><p>He bent down, his ears twitching slightly, then plunged into the sea.  He dove along the reefs, eventually finding a natural cave.  Swimming inside, he saw shimmering points of light – dragon-eye sized, luminous crystals embedded in the cave walls, ripe for the taking.</p><p>Ji Chou remained cautious.  Extracting the crystals would disturb the earth veins.  Even a wisp of leaked energy could alert others. He twitched his ears again.  As his earlobes vibrated, ripples of gray energy spread out, washing over a crystal.  Moments later, the crystal flashed and fell, landing in Ji Chou's hand.  The entire process was silent.</p><p>He repeated the method, collecting the crystals one by one with great delight, until he had gathered them all.  After casting a spell to investigate, he confirmed there were no more crystals deeper within the earth veins; they were unique to this location.  Satisfied, he stopped.</p><p>However, he didn't return immediately.  Since he had used refining a treasure as an excuse, he needed to maintain the pretense.</p><p>After waiting for a while, judging that sufficient time had passed, Ji Chou left the reef and returned to his original location.</p><p>Seeing him return, the two Quanfeng clansmen visibly relaxed. "Is the treasure refined?" they asked.</p><p>Ji Chou responded affirmatively, his expression unchanged. He produced a black disc. "I'll take watch here.  You two take turns refining this treasure."</p><p>The two were overjoyed and eagerly took the disc.</p><p>Ji Chou was completely unaware that two pairs of eyes were watching his every move, or that even those crystals had been planted.</p><p>With the seed of consciousness activated, Ji Chou returned to his normal state, feeling nothing amiss.  Even if a Quanfeng Clan elder examined him directly, they wouldn't find any abnormalities.</p><p>Seeing nothing unusual, Qin Sang and Su Nu shifted their attention, attempting to sense the location of the Quanfeng Clan elders.  Patiently waiting on the periphery, they detected no Void Refinement level auras, which was clearly abnormal.</p><p>Forced to act, Qin Sang awakened the Skyeye Butterfly, finally revealing the outline of the Quanfeng Clan's grand formation.</p><p>After discussing their findings, they confirmed it wasn't a particularly powerful confinement formation.  Such a complex spirit formation would be difficult to completely conceal, and would likely alert the two Siyou Clan members.</p><p>The formation's purpose was likely to mask the spiritual energy of this location, concealing it from the Haitang Academy's detection methods.</p><p>As long as their fight wasn't immediately discovered, they could swiftly eliminate their opponents and withdraw. By the time the Haitang Academy noticed, it would be too late to intervene.</p><p>Having determined the nature of the formation, Qin Sang and Su Nu attempted to infiltrate it.  They successfully entered without being detected, but still couldn't locate the formation master.</p><p>The formation master was likely sealed within a treasure, using it to conceal their presence.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to hide from the Skyeye Butterfly.  Despite this, the butterfly detected an anomaly.  Unable to investigate directly, Qin Sang and Su Nu could only continue observing the location.</p><p>"No rush.  The moment the formation fully activates, even the most well-hidden formation master will leak a trace of their aura…"</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted his message, patiently waiting alongside Su Nu.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Sang suddenly felt a slight tremor in the void, accompanied by two faint auras that flashed and disappeared.  If they hadn't been constantly vigilant, they would have missed it.</p><p>The aura originated from the location the Skyeye Butterfly had marked, accompanied by a flicker of dim light.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Su Nu. She had clearly sensed it too.  Her voice was grave.  "Two Hollow Void Stage Second Realm cultivators."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Likely both in the early stage."</p><p>If only these two guarded this place, Qin Sang and Su Nu could likely abduct the Siyou without much difficulty.  However, Qin Sang remained cautious.</p><p>His gaze swept across the islands below, where countless mortal cultivators, various strange creatures, and demonic beasts resided.  He couldn't tell which was the Siyou Clan's companion beast.  They simply needed to focus on the two Hollow Void Stage Second Realm cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu focused their minds.  The formation was complete. It was time to close the net!</p><p>...</p><p>A towering peak pierced the clouds, dominating most of the island.</p><p>Pine, cypress, and bamboo trees covered the mountain, shrouded in mist. It seemed an ideal location for cultivation, though the spiritual energy was somewhat thin.  Apart from a few insignificant minor sects, most who cultivated here were rogue cultivators.</p><p>On the eastern face of the mountain, facing the sea, the terrain was steep, difficult for mortals to climb.  Yet, clusters of spiritual light dotted the cliffs.</p><p>Each light represented a rogue cultivator's cave dwelling, some of which were luxurious courtyards.  Some families had lived here for generations.</p><p>Within a smaller cluster of green light, a simple cave dwelling had been carved into the cliff face. A woman paced anxiously outside the cave, frequently gazing out towards the sea.</p><p>Finally, seeing a streak of green light approaching from afar, the woman's furrowed brow relaxed, and she quickly opened the formation barrier.</p><p>The green light flew directly into the cave, revealing a man in green robes.</p><p>The woman examined him with concern. "Husband, your breathing is so labored. Are you injured? Quickly take this bottle of Blood Replenishing Powder!"</p><p>She retrieved a jade bottle and offered it with both hands.</p><p>"Thank you, wife."</p><p>The man accepted the bottle and bowed in gratitude before swallowing the medicinal powder.</p><p>The Haitang Academy valued propriety, and even husbands and wives maintained a respectful demeanor. While the academy didn't interfere in personal matters, it was customary to maintain decorum.</p><p>After taking the medicine, the man's breathing steadied. He bowed again and presented a wooden box. "Thanks to the Blood Replenishing Powder you refined earlier, my journey was quite successful.  I managed to obtain the Brocade Immortal Flower."</p><p>"Then Tan'er has hope of mastering the Shadow Form Curse!"</p><p>The woman was overjoyed.</p><p>Footsteps echoed from within the cave, and a frail young man, startled from his meditation, emerged.  He too bowed respectfully.</p><p>"Tan'er greets father! Greets mother."</p><p>The woman hurriedly handed the wooden box to the young man.  "Your father risked his life for this Brocade Immortal Flower. Tan'er, quickly refine it!"</p><p>The young man glanced at his father, thanked his parents, and returned to his meditation chamber with the box.</p><p>Watching her son's retreating figure, the woman's eyes teared up. "Although Tan'er failed the Literary Examination, if he masters the Shadow Form Curse, he can still compete in the Martial Examination.  We have no hope of achieving the Dao in this lifetime, but if Tan'er can enter the academy, I will die without regrets."</p><p>The man put his arm around the woman's shoulders, his face filled with emotion.  He was about to offer words of comfort when his expression suddenly froze. His eyes sharpened like blades, and he abruptly looked towards the sky.</p><p>At the same time, the young man, halfway into his chamber, stiffened. He slowly turned around, his expression icy, completely different from before, as if he had become another person.</p><p>"Sister, it's time…"</p><p>The woman's face was filled with shock. She suddenly lost consciousness and collapsed to the ground.</p><p>The father and son didn't even glance at her.</p><p>"They've finally come! We hid here, yet they still won't let us be!"</p><p>The man's expression contorted, his voice full of resentment. His voice changed as well, becoming old and shrill.</p><p>The young man remained silent, walking towards the cave entrance.  With each step, gray-white energy surged from his body, blurring his form. Then, as if shedding a skin, another person emerged from the shell.</p><p>The discarded shell retained the young man's appearance and aura, but it was now empty within, collapsing lifelessly on the ground.</p><p>The father and son were actually two Siyou Clan members in disguise. Now, realizing their enemies had arrived and their disguise was blown, there was no need to hide anymore.</p><p>The person who emerged from the young man's body was also a youth, with a jade-like face, phoenix eyes, crimson lips, and pale skin.  Their beauty was androgynous, almost impossible to categorize.</p><p>As they appeared, the gray-white energy that had coiled around the young man's shell retracted, sinking into their brow.  There, a translucent orb seemed to have been embedded, with energy swirling within.  It was a mystical sight, further enhancing their otherworldly presence.</p><p>The other Siyou Clan member also revealed their true form.  This was an elderly individual, with a hint of weariness in their features, yet devoid of any feminine qualities.</p><p>The two stood before the cave, gazing up at the sky.</p><p>Above, dark clouds gathered with astonishing speed, as if a celestial curtain had been drawn, enveloping the surrounding sea.</p><p>The elder gazed for a moment, then sighed deeply. "Young Master, the enemy has clearly come prepared. We must be ready for the worst!"</p><p>The young man's expression shifted slightly.  "Attendant Xia, what do you mean? We still have a companion beast outside.  The enemy was deceived by our clan's secret technique last time and believes all our beasts are gone. They won't be wary. If things go south, we can still escape."</p><p>"Even if we escape this time, we will have no more companion beasts to use. The enemy is relentless, and our capture is only a matter of time," Attendant Xia said gloomily.</p><p>The young man's expression was anxious. "They are causing chaos here.  We can still lure the Haitang Academy experts over…"</p><p>"The Haitang Academy won't interfere. They will only expel us all, which won't resolve the crisis."</p><p>Attendant Xia had made their decision. They waved a hand to stop the young man, speaking resolutely. "I know the Young Master is kind-hearted, but only this way can you escape! You must remember, no matter what, as long as you live, there is still hope. Please, value your life!"</p><p>With that, Attendant Xia bowed deeply to the young man.  "I have failed the Lord's charge, unable to continue serving at your side.  You will be alone from now on. Please, take care!"</p><p>The young man remained silent, biting their lip so hard that blood welled up.</p><p>Attendant Xia sighed, their face filled with resolve.  With a flick of their sleeve, they declared, "Young Master, please follow me to face the enemy!"</p><p>Then, they transformed into a streak of light, soaring towards the sky.</p><p>High above, atop the sea of clouds, two figures stood, looking down at the world below.</p><p>One of them, like Ji Chou, had wolf ears, but their earlobes were marked with swirling patterns, like vortexes leading to another dimension. This was a Quanfeng Clan elder.</p><p>Beside him stood a figure clad in white robes, their face and head completely concealed, making it impossible to discern their clan.</p><p>The Quanfeng Clan elder, named Ji Liang, had eyes that shone like lightning.  He peered through the dark clouds towards the cave dwelling within the barrier and let out a cold laugh. "Are you certain the younger one is the Siyou Clan's Young Master?"</p><p>"This information came directly from Elder Quan. Does Brother Ji doubt his judgment?"</p><p>The robed figure spoke confidently. "Within the Siyou Clan, there's a strict hierarchy.  The superior secret techniques are all controlled by the royal family. Since that elder is an attendant, the one they're desperately protecting must be of royal blood!"</p><p>Ji Liang mused, "It's a pity no one from the Mist Sea has come recently. I wonder what happened for the esteemed Siyou Clan Young Master to end up in the Blue Sands Province.  However, this is our opportunity.  If we capture them alive and present them to the higher-ups, the reward will be substantial. Are you prepared, brother?  Elder Quan is watching, and we must succeed."</p><p>()</p>
