<h1>Chapter 2033: Please Accept Our Condolences</h1><p>Irregular stone blocks, varying in size, floated in the void, countless in number.</p><p>The expanse of stones stretched as far as the eye could see, likely spanning tens of thousands of miles. According to Young Master Xin, this place held only stones, devoid of magical illusions or Small World fragments. A formless force seemed to bind these stones together.</p><p>These seemingly ordinary stones, having endured countless assaults from the malevolent winds and treacherous lightning, remarkably persisted to this day.</p><p>However, the Abundance Ruins’ interior was replete with phenomena that defied common sense, and the group had long grown accustomed to such oddities.</p><p>Upon entering the heart of the stone field, their eyes were met with nothing but gray stones, a monotonous landscape that resembled a gigantic labyrinth.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>A chilling wind howled incessantly through the chaotic stones. While less perilous than the malevolent winds, it still presented a considerable nuisance. Qin Sang and Young Master Xin’s group navigated the stone field, their task of locating a hidden secret realm amidst this chaos proving immensely challenging.</p><p>Prior to their current search, Young Master Xin had gathered extensive information about this place. It had attracted attention long ago, and countless searches had been conducted within. However, the area was rumored to be barren, lacking any valuable treasures, and gradually, interest waned.</p><p>Following the dying words of the Xin Clan's former patriarch, Young Master Xin conducted a covert investigation, successfully locating the secret realm. However, to orchestrate the demise of Protector Pei and Zhong Liang the Scattered Cultivator, he kept its existence concealed.</p><p>While the surface appearance of the stones varied, their composition remained similar, suggesting a shared origin. Young Master Xin speculated that they might be the remnants of a single, colossal boulder.</p><p>If this were true, how immense must the original stone have been? Throughout their journey, they had encountered countless stones that dwarfed even mountains.</p><p>After a winding path, a humid breeze wafted through the air. A flat, land-like stone, vast as a continent, materialized before them, a jade ribbon – a great river – flowing through its center.</p><p>The river surged, its banks lined with desolate stone mountains.</p><p>The group ascended the river, the secret realm located at its source.</p><p>With Young Master Xin leading the way, they soon arrived above a vast marsh.</p><p>Water vapor hung heavy in the air, shrouded in mist. Although there were no signs of life, the Xin Clan cultivators dispersed, maintaining a vigilant watch.</p><p>“Elder Qin, the entrance to the secret realm lies beneath the water,” Young Master Xin gestured downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense, discovering that the surrounding water was only a few fathoms deep, the bottom paved with sand and stones. Beneath them lay a narrow ravine, where gurgling water flowed up from below, exhibiting no unusual characteristics.</p><p>This was to be expected. If the entrance were so easily discernible, it would have been claimed long ago.</p><p>Young Master Xin retrieved a silk handkerchief from his sleeve and gently tossed it into the water.  Upon entering, the water bubbled as if boiling, releasing a dense fog that quickly enveloped the surrounding area in a white haze.</p><p>As it descended, the handkerchief's color gradually faded until it became transparent, merging completely with the water.</p><p>The next moment, a faint silver glow emanated from within the ravine.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he surveyed the surroundings. They had remained stationary, and the surrounding fog remained undisturbed. Yet, within Qin Sang's perception, an unknown transformation was unfolding nearby.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Suddenly, a fierce wind swept through, churning the white fog and twisting it into indescribable shapes.</p><p>The others, sensing the anomaly, grew wary.</p><p>As time passed, the wind intensified, its roar deafening, even more piercing than thunder, as if the earth were tearing apart and the heavens were overturning.</p><p>Young Master Xin, his expression composed, stood beside Qin Sang, awaiting instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a moment, then instructed the Xin Clan members to proceed first. He then gently took a step forward. With that single step, he seemed to enter a new world. The wind grew even more violent, white fog enveloping the entire space. The swirling wind and mist created a dreamlike illusion, yet the terrifying roar of the wind shattered the dream.</p><p>The raging wind brought with it an aura of chaos, unsettling the group.</p><p>“Is this it?” Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded, his gaze sweeping the area as if searching for something.</p><p>“It seems this secret realm is on the verge of collapse,” Qin Sang remarked.</p><p>This fluctuation was familiar; they had recently experienced a similar phenomenon within the tomb. It was a sign of a secret realm approaching destruction.</p><p>This place was in even worse condition than the tomb. The secret realm was likely already unstable, and their entry had accelerated its collapse.</p><p>“Elder Qin, look,” Young Master Xin pointed towards the depths of the swirling wind and mist, where a slender, white shadow faintly appeared.</p><p>The white shadow, cylindrical in shape, floated amidst the wind, rising and falling.</p><p>Qin Sang stretched out his hand, summoning the white shadow before him. It turned out to be a jade pillar, nearly two zhang long and requiring three people to embrace its circumference fully.  Several cracks marred its surface, and it was incomplete, one end displaying a clear break.</p><p>The jade pillar was crystalline, its interior flowing like water.</p><p>Upon seeing the pillar, Young Master Xin breathed a sigh of relief. “This jade pillar must be supporting this secret realm. With the pillar damaged, the realm has lost its support. There must be more than one jade pillar here!”</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, carefully sensing, and indeed detected a unique fluctuation, indicating that it was artificially refined.</p><p>This was a peculiar refining technique, piquing Qin Sang’s interest. However, a single broken pillar was insufficient to grasp the complete method.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang gave the order, and the group continued deeper into the wind and mist, soon finding another damaged jade pillar, this one even more fragmented.</p><p>Having been inside for so long without encountering any danger, Qin Sang commanded, “Split up and search, bring all the jade pillars here.”</p><p>He then sat cross-legged in mid-air, placing one hand on the jade pillar, closing his eyes to meditate, with Young Master Xin standing respectfully by his side.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The group dispersed to carry out his orders.</p><p>Subsequently, individuals returned with fragments of jade pillars, but none were intact.</p><p>Just then, someone hastily reported, “Young Master! Elder Qin! There's a complete jade pillar ahead, but it cannot be moved!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately rose and followed the individual to the jade pillar's location.</p><p>The jade pillar stood erect in the void, neither touching the heavens above nor the earth below, yet remaining remarkably stable, like a divine needle anchoring the heavens. It was almost entirely undamaged.</p><p>Qin Sang approached, gently stroking the jade pillar, his eyes gleaming. This pillar, combined with the previous fragments, provided him with enough information to deduce a great deal.</p><p>“The wind seems to be growing stronger…”</p><p>Someone murmured, their face etched with worry.  This indicated that the secret realm was rapidly collapsing, leaving them little time. They needed to find a solution quickly.</p><p>Young Master Xin opened his mouth to speak, when a shout echoed from afar. A young man in gray robes, having seemingly discovered something, hurried towards them.</p><p>“Young Master!”</p><p>“Old Thirteen, you've already reached Nascent Soul, why are you still so impetuous? What happened?” Young Master Xin frowned slightly.</p><p>Reprimanded by the Young Master, the gray-robed youth appeared embarrassed. He glanced at Qin Sang and said, “Young Master, we've discovered an unusual place, but we're uncertain about its nature. Elder Da is guarding it, hesitant to act rashly, and has instructed me to request your presence.”</p><p>Young Master Xin acknowledged with a hum. He appeared composed, as if he had already been aware, and was in no hurry to depart. He respectfully addressed Qin Sang, “Elder Qin, is there any possibility of repairing these jade pillars?”</p><p>“They can be repaired, and it doesn't require a Grandmaster Refiner to do so. You invited this old man here for a rather trivial matter,” Qin Sang stated.</p><p>“This matter is of utmost importance, and this junior dares not be careless. If these jade pillars are repaired, can it halt the collapse of the secret realm?” Young Master Xin asked hopefully.</p><p>“It can, but only temporarily. The number of jade pillars is clearly incomplete. To completely stabilize the secret realm, new jade pillars must be refined and added.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, “You probably don’t have the necessary spiritual materials to refine the jade pillars at present, do you?”</p><p>Young Master Xin sighed. “Only after entering the secret realm did we see its complete state. This junior made various preparations, but it was impossible to anticipate everything. Would Senior have the time to wait for us to gather the spiritual materials outside…”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, interrupting Young Master Xin.  “As this old man said, as long as one understands the method, refining the jade pillars isn’t difficult. Repairing and erecting these jade pillars will certainly stabilize the secret realm for a time. This old man will comprehend the complete refining method and pass it on to you. After leaving, you can have others refine them.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet agreed to Young Master Xin's proposal of having the Xin Clan pledge allegiance to him.</p><p>Even if he agreed, it would be for the Xin Clan to serve him, not the other way around, attending to every detail personally.</p><p>Young Master Xin responded with a respectful, “Yes! This junior obeys!”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in a rush to begin refining. He was also curious about the treasures within the secret realm. He instructed the gray-robed youth to lead the way.</p><p>Before long, they arrived at the location. Elder Da, guarding the site, immediately approached, his tone barely concealing his excitement, as if he had discovered some precious treasure.</p><p>“Young Master, there's likely Heavenly Frost Rune Silver here!”</p><p>Ahead, the dense fog persisted, yet within it swirled a patch of silvery-white mist, distinct from the rest. The silver mist remained cohesive, and a gurgling sound emanated from within, as if from a spring.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up as he examined the silver mist. This was something he had never encountered before, nor had he even heard of the name Heavenly Frost Rune Silver.</p><p>Heavenly Frost Rune Silver sounded like a type of spiritual material, yet the Five Elements Alliance's records contained no mention of it.</p><p>“Old Thirteen,” Young Master Xin beckoned the gray-robed youth closer and whispered a few instructions.</p><p>The gray-robed youth chanted incantations and formed a hand seal. Light and shadow flickered around him, and he took a step to the left, leaving behind an illusory shadow shaped like a gray wolf.</p><p>The gray wolf craned its neck, then leaped into the silver mist, letting out a silent howl. A layer of silver mist immediately adhered to its body.</p><p>The silver mist continued to seep into the gray wolf, quickly absorbing more than half of it, revealing what lay within: a pool of liquid silver.</p><p>When the gray wolf emerged, it had transformed into a silver wolf, its spirit invigorated, its form solidified, its aura potent, having clearly undergone some kind of qualitative change.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, the Xin Clan members rejoiced.</p><p>“It is indeed Heavenly Frost Rune Silver!”</p><p>Young Master Xin also beamed with delight. Noticing Qin Sang’s gaze, he quickly explained, “Elder Qin, Heavenly Frost Rune Silver is not a naturally occurring spiritual silver, but one that is refined.</p><p>“Our Xin Clan’s Shadow Transformation technique, when combined with specific treasures, can undergo a further transformation, greatly increasing its power. However, only a few materials, including Heavenly Frost Rune Silver, meet the requirements.</p><p>“Among them, Heavenly Frost Rune Silver is the most compatible. However, the refining method has long been lost. My father, by a stroke of luck, discovered that this place might contain Heavenly Frost Rune Silver, and that it can continuously regenerate…”</p><p>A continuous source of Heavenly Frost Rune Silver was indeed a treasure trove for the Xin Clan, a place they would undoubtedly strive to protect.</p><p>So, it was an artificially refined material, which explained why he had never heard of it before.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a drop of Heavenly Frost Rune Silver, carefully sensing it, and couldn't help but marvel at its ingenuity.</p><p>Unable to discern its uses for the time being, Qin Sang, upholding his duty as a refiner, collected a casket of Heavenly Frost Rune Silver for future study, and the Xin Clan naturally dared not object.</p><p>Within the entire secret realm, this pool of Heavenly Frost Rune Silver was the most valuable asset.</p><p>The following tasks were straightforward. Qin Sang found a suitable location and began repairing the jade pillars.</p><p>Young Master Xin assembled the Xin Clan cultivators, queuing them to refine the Heavenly Frost Rune Silver and enhance their divine abilities. These were the elites of the Xin Clan, the core members. After this expedition, the overall strength of the Xin Clan was bound to ascend to a new level. Excluding Soul Formation cultivators, they might even surpass the clan's power during the previous patriarch's reign.</p><p>When the first jade pillar was refined and erected, the trend of the secret realm's collapse was indeed alleviated.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang and the Xin Clan were engaged in their efforts, four streaks of light flew together through the Abundance Ruins, searching for something.</p><p>Their attire clearly identified them as Buddhist disciples – one bhikkhu and three bhikkhunis.</p><p>The monk had nine ring scars on his head, clad in gold-threaded kasaya robes, a string of prayer beads in his hand. A golden light enveloped him, resembling a Buddhist aura. He was a virtuous and eminent monk.</p><p>The three bhikkhunis all wore haiqing robes and monastic caps. One elderly nun continued to silently chant scriptures even as she flew. Judging by her aura, her cultivation level was comparable to the monk’s.</p><p>The two other bhikkhunis followed behind the elder nun. One was a young nun, her natural beauty barely concealed by her simple robes. Despite being a member of the Buddhist sangha, the strands of hair visible beneath her monastic cap indicated that she had not yet been tonsured.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a fragment of a sword pavilion – the Purple Star Palace fragment where Mount Tian was located.</p><p>Seeing the near-total destruction of Mount Tian, the young nun’s face was etched with alarm. She flashed forward, landing at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The rubble and ruins before her bore witness to the terrifying events that had transpired.</p><p>If anyone had been on the mountain at the time, they would likely have perished alongside it, leaving no trace.</p><p>At this moment, all hopes turned to dust.</p><p>The young nun trembled, closing her eyes in anguish.</p><p>She had searched tirelessly for a millennium, only to be met with such a cruel fate.</p><p>The other three exchanged glances and slowly approached.</p><p>Seeing the young nun’s expression, they knew without asking that this was the place they sought. They surveyed Mount Tian, attempting to find any encouraging signs, but ultimately, the monk and the elder nun exchanged a look of无奈 (helplessness) and sighed.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>The monk chanted a Buddhist invocation.</p><p>The elderly nun sighed deeply, her eyes filled with compassion. “Junior Sister, please accept our condolences.”</p><p>‘Plop!’</p><p>A tear drop stained the ground.</p><p>The elder nun opened her mouth, intending to offer further comfort, when a violent tremor suddenly reverberated through the void.</p><p>The change was so abrupt that everyone, except the young nun lost in grief, was startled.</p><p>“Is it the malevolent wind and treacherous lightning about to erupt?” another bhikkhuni asked.</p><p>“Something’s not right!”</p><p>The monk’s expression grew grave as he stared intently into the depths of the Abundance Ruins.</p><p>The next moment, a bolt of lightning, seemingly traversing millions of miles, tore through the Abundance Ruins. A profound aura followed, permeating the entire ancient battlefield!</p>
