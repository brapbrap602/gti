<h1>Chapter 1852:  The Southern Heavenly Gate</h1><p>‘Dang!’</p><p>A muffled sound like a bronze bell resonated from the half-edict.</p><p>All cultivators, both human and demon, felt their hearts tremble at the sound, a strange unease washing over them.</p><p>The old Daoist reached for the other half of the edict before him, but it was too late.</p><p>The half-edict violently vibrated; the spirit talisman sealing it flickered brightly, then spontaneously ignited in a fireless flame, instantly consuming its power.</p><p>‘Dang!’</p><p>Two bell tolls rang out in quick succession, almost blending into a single sound echoing through the auspicious clouds.</p><p>The bell's resonance not only stirred the hearts of those present but also caused the auspicious clouds to churn restlessly, birthing a sudden hurricane.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>A fierce wind howled, the clouds swirling wildly.</p><p>Two golden lights burst forth from the two half-edicts almost simultaneously.  The old Daoist's expression changed drastically, but he was powerless to stop it, watching helplessly as the golden light shot towards the heavens.</p><p>The two golden lights converged in the void, forming a complete golden character ‘敕’ before everyone.</p><p>The character ‘敕’ glowed with golden light, its inner divine intent palpable.</p><p>The surrounding phenomena intensified.</p><p>A middle-aged scholar smiled smugly, glancing at the old Daoist.</p><p>The old Daoist's face was grim. Ignoring the provocation, he ceased his attempts to seal the edict, looking up towards the depths of the auspicious clouds with utmost gravity.</p><p>At this moment, all eyes were drawn to the golden character.</p><p>With the appearance of the ‘敕’ character, an unprecedented strange energy emanated from the depths of the auspicious clouds, felt by all cultivators present.</p><p>The middle-aged scholar stood, hands behind his back, gazing towards the clouds with excited eyes.</p><p>Though somewhat reluctant, the old Daoist couldn’t help but anticipate the sight of the legendary Celestial Court.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The golden ‘敕’ character shone brilliantly, then shattered.</p><p>What followed was unexpected, leaving everyone present—humans and demons alike—with a strange expression.</p><p>The extraordinary phenomena abruptly ceased; the energy emanating from the depths of the auspicious clouds rapidly dissipated, vanishing in an instant.</p><p>Several Grand Masters and Demon Kings, ready to issue orders and seize the Celestial Court, were utterly unprepared for this turn of events.</p><p>The middle-aged scholar’s face turned livid. He sharply turned, his eyes fixed on the half-edict before the old Daoist.</p><p>The old Daoist, realizing the incomplete edict was the cause, felt a surge of relief. His side had only four Grand Masters, placing them at a clear disadvantage.  A delay would work in their favor!</p><p>Secretly ordering his men to prepare, the old Daoist used his sleeve to shield the half-edict from the middle-aged scholar’s greedy gaze, about to put it away.</p><p>Just then, another change occurred.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The clouds roiled incessantly, accompanied by muffled sounds like thunder emanating from deep within the altar, shaking the ground violently.</p><p>Lesser demon soldiers felt a surge of blood, their bodies resisting the force.</p><p>Simultaneously, all cultivators felt the entire altar tremble!</p><p>This tremor was far more violent than the one that accompanied the appearance of the Vajra Bodhi tree.</p><p>The Grand Masters who had yet to arrive hastened their pace, fearing the demons would get there first.</p><p>Liu Zhenren glanced at the seated Zuo Zhenren beside him, his anxiety growing.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren’s injuries were severe; his recovery was far from instantaneous, and he feared he wouldn’t make it in time.</p><p>As the tremors grew stronger, Zuo Zhenren only twitched slightly and did not awaken.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other demons at the bottom of the blue light sea also felt the anomaly.</p><p>Qin Sang, moving through the light waves, paused, sensing for a moment before looking toward the surface.</p><p>Since the tremors originated from outside and were unrelated to the Vajra Bodhi tree, Qin Sang didn't pay it much attention, glancing once before returning his gaze.</p><p>However, this tremor was clearly unusual.  The Grand Masters and Demon Kings had lowered their cultivation to enter the altar, making things more complicated than he’d imagined. It was best to obtain the Vajra fruit and return to his cave as quickly as possible.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang moved faster.</p><p>In the distance, Ling You Wang and other demons also stopped, looking towards the sky.</p><p>“My Lord, perhaps Yan Wang and the others have found the entrance to the Celestial Court,” Ding Xiang Hou whispered.</p><p>Ling You Wang’s expression remained calm.  He made a noncommittal sound, uninterestedly returning his gaze to continue guiding his ghostly waves forward.</p><p>Watching Ling You Wang’s back, a hint of helplessness flashed in Ding Xiang Hou’s eyes. He disagreed with his lord’s approach.</p><p>The struggle for the Celestial Court was not merely a matter of merit; it concerned the Dao itself.</p><p>Controlling the Celestial Court would restore the connection between the city’s seal and the Celestial Court, restoring its full power.  Whether pursuing the divine path or continuing their existing cultivation, they would no longer be limited by the city seal, opening up boundless possibilities.</p><p>Ling You Wang would understand what that meant.</p><p>Establishing such great merit would please the Great Saint and bring rich rewards. Perhaps Ling You Wang himself would be next to ascend to the position of Great Saint.</p><p>Such was the way of the world – one person’s ascension lifts all those connected to them.</p><p>A certain lord, the Marquis of Dingxiang, sighed inwardly at having followed an unambitious prince.  He and the other demon lords pressed forward nonetheless.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Waves of tremors struck.</p><p>The clouds churned, causing the old Taoist and the middle-aged scholar to momentarily cease their quarrel.</p><p>Shortly afterward, everyone—human and demon—saw golden light spreading from deep within the ritual grounds. They had witnessed such celestial displays many times, but this was different.  This golden light was gentle, passing over them like a refreshing breeze, filling them with a sense of peace.</p><p>Then, they saw a radiant glow emerging from the golden light, revealing a strange sight.  Its outline seemed to be that of a divine gate.</p><p>Even before the gate's true form was revealed, ten thousand golden rays rolled like crimson ribbons, and thousands of auspicious clouds billowed purple mist. Three particularly bright clusters of golden light atop the gate's outline seemed to form three large golden characters.</p><p>Beyond the gate, the sky glowed brilliantly, a misty azure expanse hinting at celestial palaces and treasure halls, as if it led to an immortal realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, perhaps due to the distance, no matter how hard they strained their eyes or used their divine vision, they couldn't see clearly.</p><p>For a time, all the cultivators, human and demon alike, were captivated.</p><p>“This… could this be the legendary South Heavenly Gate?”</p><p>The old Taoist clutched his half-token, sensing its trembling as if it wanted to break free from his grasp and fly towards the celestial palaces behind the gate.</p><p>“It truly is the Divine Court… the great upheaval at the ritual grounds over a hundred years ago was truly a sign of the Divine Court's emergence…”</p><p>Master Ruquan murmured, finally daring to believe it was real.</p><p>Upon hearing the claim of the Divine Court's imminent appearance, she had been skeptical. Even if these Daoist legends were true, the sudden emergence of the Divine Court after so many centuries of silence was suspicious.</p><p>To her knowledge, after the great upheaval, the Daoist Court had sent people to investigate the ritual grounds, finding nothing unusual.</p><p>Decades after the upheaval, the Imperial Edict appeared, discovered first by the Gui Fang nation, not the Daoist sect that created the Divine Court.</p><p>Later, the Daoist Court sent people with half an Imperial Edict multiple times into the ritual grounds, finding no divine anomalies.  They only confirmed the edict's connection to the Divine Court through other methods, after nearly a hundred years.</p><p>From the discovery of the edict to the confirmation of its origins, demons had always played a role.</p><p>Now, seeing the legendary South Heavenly Gate with their own eyes, she could no longer doubt.</p><p>The location of the South Heavenly Gate was the very source of the great upheaval at the ritual grounds over a hundred years ago, clearly inextricably linked.</p><p>Master Ruquan could hardly contain her excitement.  Those who weren't Grand Masters couldn't understand the overwhelming oppression they felt—the feeling of having a path but not daring to tread it, of facing an uncertain future.</p><p>Finally, the first rays of dawn appeared!</p><p>At that moment, the golden light began to fade, and the image of the celestial palaces gradually blurred.</p><p>The cultivators' hearts tightened, fearing the South Heavenly Gate would vanish, their hopes dashed.</p><p>However, the half-token in the old Taoist's hand continued to tremble, clearly guiding their way.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>At the old Taoist's command, the giant black sword turned and cut through the clouds.</p><p>The demon cultivators were not to be outdone.  They formed a battle array around the middle-aged scholar, with several demon kings' divine forms surrounding them in all directions, leading their demon lords in flight, their speed no less than that of the giant sword.</p><p>As they flew, those who knew the truth exchanged information in secret.</p><p>“Is that the legendary South Heavenly Gate?”</p><p>“The prince said the South Heavenly Gate is the entrance to the Divine Court. But, though this gate is wondrous, why does it seem… incomplete?”</p><p>“Didn't the prince say the Divine Court was struck down from the heavens and fell to earth, the South Heavenly Gate bearing the brunt?  What’s strange about it being incomplete?  I fear the inside is just a ruin.”</p><p>“Even if it's a ruin, it's still the Divine Court. The Great Saint Mansion surely has a way to restore it. Otherwise, why would so many princes willingly curtail their cultivation…”</p><p>Humans and demons alike, each with their own thoughts, traversed the layers of illusions.</p><p>If Qin Sang were here, seeing the direction they were heading, she would be astonished.</p><p>The South Heavenly Gate's location seemed to be near the illusions of the Vermilion Gold Spiritual Needle and the Ancient Mirror!</p><p>…</p><p>Unaware of all this, Qin Sang was traveling through the depths of the sea of light, diligently searching for the Vajra Bodhi tree.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Just as the external tremors stopped, the sea of light began to shake again.</p><p>The impact on Qin Sang was even more violent than before. She could only struggle to resist the light waves, to avoid being pushed too far and losing all her previous effort.</p><p>Her figure bobbed erratically in the light waves, unable to maintain a fixed position.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to remain vigilant, focusing a strand of her mind on sensing each light wave, attempting to find patterns in the chaos.</p><p>This strategy was inspired by the Spirit Nether King.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang's current location was practically the epicenter of the tremors.</p><p>The source wasn't a single point, but a vast expanse at the bottom of the luminous sea.  The scene was monotonous, lacking any distinguishing features, requiring inch-by-inch searching.</p><p>Qin Sang had been searching for some time, with little success, failing to find the Diamond Bodhi tree.</p><p>Ling You Wang and the other demons were also present.  Because of Qin Sang, they didn't dare to split up, and since Qin Sang was deliberately avoiding them, there had been no encounters.</p><p>As time passed, the luminous waves reached their peak intensity. Qin Sang, having a sudden insight, waited patiently until the vibrations subsided to a tolerable level.</p><p>With a flap of his phoenix wings, he chose a direction and flew off.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw a deep blue line far ahead.</p><p>The blue line wasn't straight, it meandered, its ends unseen. Closer, he could see alternating light and shadow, wave after wave of surges rushing towards him—the luminous waves erupting from this line.</p><p>It seemed like a deep trench, constantly spewing out a torrent.</p><p>Qin Sang headed straight for the blue line.  As he approached, his expression shifted slightly, and he turned his head towards the other end of the line.</p><p>Even with his Heavenly Eye fully activated, he could only vaguely see a dark wave hidden within the blue line.</p><p>"How fast!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. That dark wave could only be Ling You Wang.</p><p>He thought Ling You Wang would be slower, gathering the scattered demon lords, but he was faster than Qin Sang himself.</p><p>The methods of a demon king were truly unfathomable!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, but showed no sign of retreat.  He flapped his phoenix wings forcefully, instantly reaching the blue line.</p><p>Before him was a blue fissure, its interior filled with a swirling blue light, like a mysterious blue valley.</p><p>Luminous waves constantly surged from the valley, trying to push him away.</p><p>The force of the waves grew weaker with each surge, and the valley was rapidly closing.</p><p>Clearly, the valley's closure brought temporary stability to the luminous sea, while its opening caused the sea to shake.</p><p>But how many more times could the valley open?</p><p>Once the valley completely sealed, would those inside be able to get out?</p><p>These questions arose in Qin Sang's mind, but no one could answer them.  This was a risk inherent in treasure hunting.</p><p>He was always cautious, yet when opportunity presented itself, he never lacked courage or determination—that's how he had gotten this far.</p><p>His gaze hardened, Qin Sang hesitated not at all, and plunged into the valley!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Only after entering did Qin Sang realize that the inside of the valley was far more chaotic than the outside.  He was immediately hit by three converging luminous waves, as if struck simultaneously by three giant hammers.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator would likely be turned into mincemeat.</p><p>The Mingshan Armor shone brightly. Qin Sang's arms trembled as he smashed the waves before him with powerful punches, breaking free.</p><p>Luminous waves rose and fell within his field of vision, an endless expanse of deep blue, yet devoid of anything tangible.</p><p>The valley seemed to be a void, the limits of its space unknown. Searching for a single tree here was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Qin Sang used his wooden body to sense, finding no Wood Spirit energy nearby.  He continued to descend, planning to reach the valley bottom first.</p><p>He weaved through the gaps between the waves, struggling greatly.</p><p>However, Qin Sang considered this a good thing.  Those demon cultivators would have difficulty maintaining their formation here, unless Ling You Wang continuously used his powerful abilities, willing to bear the drain on his strength.</p><p>The valley was bottomless; the others would probably have to search separately.</p><p>He shouldn't have to worry about facing a whole group of demon cultivators at once.</p><p>After descending an unknown distance, a point of light suddenly flashed before his eyes.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly as he dashed forward, immediately spotting a bubble rising and falling in the luminous waves.</p><p>He'd seen such bubbles outside the valley, but only fleetingly.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to approach, he saw cracks forming on the bubble's surface, indicating it was about to burst.  He paused, activating his Heavenly Eye to observe.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he saw a mountain inside the bubble, lush with green vegetation and a thatched hut near the summit, its door half-open.</p><p>The scene within the bubble was incredibly realistic, each tree looking exactly like a real tree.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The bubble burst, and the mountain and hut vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly moved forward, carefully sensing, but the burst bubble had left nothing behind.</p><p>It was all like a mirage.</p><p>He was puzzled but decided to suppress his questions and continue his descent.</p><p>Gradually, he encountered more and more bubbles.</p><p>Each bubble contained an almost real scene, but each was different: mountains and rivers, fields and villages, palaces and towers—a diverse array, lacking only living beings.</p><p>If real, they left no trace upon bursting.</p><p>If illusion, every detail was incredibly vivid.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A luminous wave carrying a bubble surged towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, seeing an octagonal pavilion within, its pillars adorned with exquisite murals.</p><p>He approached the bubble, reaching out to grasp it, expecting to find nothing again.</p><p>The next moment, his expression changed, and he quickly retracted his hand, feeling a heavy weight in his palm—he had grasped a red tile, clearly from the octagonal pavilion.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The bubble shattered, the pavilion gone.</p><p>Still leaving no trace, only a tile in his hand!</p><p></p>
