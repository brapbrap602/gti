<h1>Chapter 1775: Annihilation</h1><p>Chapter 1775: Annihilation</p><p>At the foot of Yitian Peak.</p><p>Old Devil Mu had successfully escaped here, while the battle on the mountaintop raged on.  His physical body was destroyed, but luckily his spiritual sense was comparable to that of a powerful cultivator.  He managed to survive a fatal blow by using a life-saving technique and sacrificing a Fire Lotus Seed. Otherwise, his Nascent Soul would have been shattered, ending his life instantly.</p><p>His condition was still precarious. Only a remnant of his Nascent Soul remained, and the painstakingly refined Fire Lotus Seed was exhausted.  While his cultivation allowed him to withstand the pressure of the Spirit-Subduing Realm without much difficulty—previously, the effect was negligible—his severe injuries made even this minor influence significant.  A decline in cultivation realm would lead to a far worse outcome.</p><p>Old Devil Mu had burned his essence to escape undetected.</p><p>“Madam Li! Four Saints Palace!”</p><p>He glared resentfully at the mountaintop.  This collaboration with the Demon Lord had resulted in a complete loss—his essence was severely damaged again.</p><p>He dared not seek help from the Demon Lord.  He had no doubt that if he fell into the Demon Lord's hands, his Nascent Soul would be seized, or even worse, refined into a demonic puppet.</p><p>After this battle, Old Devil Mu understood that he could only lie dormant. With the Fire Lotus Seed destroyed and his grievous injuries, even recovering his cultivation and avoiding a decline in realm would be a stroke of divine luck. He didn't know how long it would take to make a comeback.</p><p>“That young man from the Merchant Guild…”</p><p>Old Devil Mu thought back to the beginning of it all—the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire—and gritted his teeth.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Old Devil Mu flew low to the ground, crossing a field of petrified vegetation.  Suddenly, he felt a pang of foreboding.  A deafening thunderclap exploded above him.</p><p>A bolt from the blue.</p><p>An aura of destruction descended.</p><p>“Someone!”</p><p>Old Devil Mu was startled. A silver light filled his vision, a blinding flash of lightning.</p><p>He thought he had successfully escaped unnoticed, but his whereabouts had been exposed.</p><p>Despair filled Old Devil Mu's heart.</p><p>Due to the restrictions of the ancient Spirit-Subduing Realm prohibition, the attacker was at least a peak mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.  The Merchant Alliance, the Four Saints Palace, and the leaders of both righteous and demonic paths were present at the ancient demonic seal, but that didn't mean those were the only powerful cultivators in the vicinity. Someone else must have been lurking nearby, discovering his trail.</p><p>In his current state, he was utterly helpless against such an opponent.  And the attacker was resorting to underhanded tactics, tracking him here to ambush him.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The thunderbolt struck Old Devil Mu's remnant Nascent Soul directly. His location was completely under the attacker's control.</p><p>Even in this desperate situation, Old Devil Mu didn't give up, desperately fighting for survival.</p><p>He burned his life force again, teleporting to escape.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The thunderbolt pierced the shadowy remnant of his Nascent Soul, striking the ground violently.  A huge crater was blasted into the petrified vegetation, rocks flying everywhere.  The power of the thunderbolt raged, countless sparks and arcs flashing through the petrified vegetation, which was instantly reduced to dust.</p><p>Old Devil Mu's remnant Nascent Soul teleported out of the area, avoiding the thunderbolt.</p><p>He was somewhat surprised; the thunderbolt's power wasn't as strong as he'd expected.</p><p>Before he could ponder this thought…</p><p>As his remnant Nascent Soul reappeared elsewhere, a gust of wind suddenly assaulted him.  A blue light rapidly expanded in his vision.</p><p>Bai, leaning against Qin Sang, the gray aura protecting a small area around Qin Sang, was unaffected by the Spirit-Subduing Realm restrictions.  Bai had already prepared the Star Conch, accurately predicting Old Devil Mu's teleportation location. He immediately launched it, giving Old Devil Mu no chance to recover.</p><p>The two were inevitably somewhat tense.  If their judgment was wrong and the ambush failed, they were ready to flee at any moment.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Star Conch spun, carrying extreme sharpness.</p><p>Old Devil Mu's remnant Nascent Soul had not yet recovered its strength. In his haste, he could only raise his weak hand, barely condensing a thin barrier of icy flames, but it was pierced before it even fully formed.</p><p>‘Puff!’</p><p>The power of the Star Conch exploded. Old Devil Mu was unable to dodge or resist. His remnant Nascent Soul was torn again, his aura extremely weak.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang rejoiced; his judgment had been correct.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The light suddenly dimmed. Banners fluttered, and surging demonic fire engulfed the sky and earth.</p><p>Old Devil Mu's survival was expected by Qin Sang.</p><p>To ensure success, while using the Summoning Thunder Technique, Qin Sang had generously consumed a drop of Three Lights Jade Liquid.  His true energy was exceptionally full.</p><p>As long as Old Devil Mu could be eliminated, these costs were worthwhile.</p><p>The Demon Banner Formation was the true killing move!</p><p>Nine demon banners soared into the air, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire surging out, instantly engulfing the remnant Nascent Soul.  At the same time, Qin Sang also flashed, sword in hand.</p><p>Seeing these familiar demonic flames, Old Devil Mu was taken aback, then noticing the realm of the attacker, he was momentarily stunned, thinking he had made a mistake.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Old Devil Mu immediately realized who it was.</p><p>This cultivator, only at the Golden Core stage, yet able to wield demonic flames—his true identity was revealed: the young man from the Qiongyu Trading Company he'd been searching for.</p><p>Outside the Outer Hall, the order was: kill a thousand by mistake rather than let one escape.</p><p>The Fire Curse seed: a relentless pursuit across a thousand miles.</p><p>The young man, using some unknown method, repeatedly escaped death, yet this only seemed to bring misfortune upon himself.</p><p>Now, at his weakest moment, the young man appeared again, aiming for his life!</p><p>Old Man Mu couldn't understand.  This young man, with only Golden Core cultivation, moved freely within the Spirit-Suppressing Realm, appearing before him as if descending from the heavens.</p><p>But none of that mattered anymore.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A torrent of demonic flames surged forward, breaking through the icy flames.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire burned fiercely.</p><p>Old Man Mu, already incredibly weakened from using a spatial displacement technique that had depleted his energy and reopened old wounds, was overwhelmed by the demonic flames, momentarily dazed; he didn't even have time to self-destruct.</p><p>The demonic flames engulfed the remnant soul. The ebony sword transformed into a sword wheel. Bai Yi used corpse energy to help, and the Spirit-Suppressing Realm's restrictions also took effect.</p><p>The remnant soul was like a flickering candle.</p><p>Seeing that Old Man Mu's remnant soul was shattered and powerless, Qin Sang had an idea. He formed a hand seal, attempting to seize Old Man Mu's soul.</p><p>"You insignificant brat, dare to attempt soul searching on me!"</p><p>The remnant soul coldly looked at Qin Sang. Its eyes showed no resentment or anger, only a hint of unwillingness.</p><p>Old Man Mu had always acted without restraint throughout his life, anticipating a day like this, but never expecting to fall at the hands of such an enemy.</p><p>The remnant soul closed its eyes. The last wisp of icy flame showed signs of instability.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a desolate aura emanating from the remnant soul, its soul on the verge of annihilation. He sighed inwardly—these old cultivators all had defensive measures. The higher the cultivation, the harder soul searching became.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang used the demonic fire to burn the remnant soul and prepared to retreat, fearing Old Man Mu might have some last-minute scheme.</p><p>At that moment, he suddenly discovered an unusual light point within the icy flames, resembling a lotus seed.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  Convinced it wasn't a self-destructing mechanism, he immediately manipulated the demonic fire, forming a large hand to grab it.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The Winter Nether icy flames retreated, the lotus seed revealed, seized by the demonic fire and brought before Qin Sang.</p><p>"Not a storage artifact."</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense scanned it, disappointment etched on his face.</p><p>"Careful! Someone!"</p><p>Suddenly, Bai's voice rang out. Qin Sang's eyelids twitched.</p>
