<h1>Chapter 2199:  A Trap Laid</h1><p>“That trick again!”</p><p>A cold snort echoed from within the swarm of insects, laced with annoyance.  Their distance to the bolt of azure lightning ahead was steadily decreasing when, suddenly, the lightning veered, plunging into the nearby mud, vanishing from sight in an instant.</p><p>This wasn't ordinary mud; it was clearly a manifestation of a restrictive formation, its interior unknown and potentially fraught with danger.</p><p>The bolt of lightning was, of course, Qin Sang.  He had been pursued to this point, and despite his considerable strength, facing overwhelming odds without Liuli to shield him from the Nine-Revolution Annihilation Wind, he was showing signs of exhaustion.</p><p>However, whenever Qin Sang was about to be overtaken, he would throw himself recklessly into nearby hidden realms or ancient restrictions, preferring to risk injury within rather than be cornered.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was a life-or-death struggle, a fight for survival where he would stop at nothing to stay alive.  But it wasn't the same for his pursuers. The man in green robes, unlike the young cultivator seeking revenge, was merely assisting and had no desire to be seriously injured, causing him to hesitate.  Opportunities were fleeting; a moment's hesitation would allow Qin Sang to escape again, giving him precious breathing room.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang resort to his old tactics, they had no choice but to follow him into the mud.  They had no better option than to stay on his heels, preventing him from using the complex terrain to escape.</p><p>Upon entering the mud, a suffocating pressure bore down from all sides.  The spiritual energy was unlike anything they had experienced before, heavier than mountains, and incredibly difficult to manipulate.</p><p>They sensed Qin Sang's speed drastically decrease ahead, but the pressure affected all intruders equally, forcing them to slow down as well.</p><p>“Brother Qi, still no news?”</p><p>The man in green robes said gravely.</p><p>The pursuit wasn't entirely fruitless; Qin Sang's injuries were worsening.  Given the current situation, they were certain to eventually corner and kill him.  But a cornered beast fights desperately; there was a risk of Qin Sang employing a last-ditch, mutually destructive tactic.  Only with the black-robed cultivator’s assistance could they guarantee success.</p><p>Yet, the black-robed cultivator was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Brother Qi might be trying to eliminate the female cultivator first, to remove a future threat,” the young cultivator speculated.</p><p>With his enemy so close yet still out of reach, he was becoming restless, forcing himself to remain calm.</p><p>“That woman's cultivation is weak, but the talisman she carries isn't simple.  Injuring her is easy, but killing her might be difficult.  It’s better to severely wound and drive her off, then kill our main target. She won't be able to cause trouble afterward…”</p><p>The green-robed cultivator, having experienced firsthand the power of the Imperial Heavenly Talisman, had a similar thought to the black-robed cultivator.  They never imagined that Brother Qi, with his strength, would be held back.</p><p>The young cultivator frowned.  In his view, avenging Qin Sang was paramount.  But if Brother Qi believed that killing Qin Sang would incur the wrath of the female cultivator, leaving her alive would create a hidden danger, so his desire to finish things here was understandable.</p><p>The mud not only exerted immense pressure but also concealed other dangers, like countless strange fish that lurked within, devoid of any life aura, appearing and disappearing without warning—a very eerie phenomenon.</p><p>Qin Sang unfortunately collided with one, and was immediately entangled, only managing to escape using his Xuanhuan Divine Light.  Some of his injuries were sustained this way, some intentionally incurred to avoid revealing his knowledge of Panlong Cave to his enemies.  So far, his plan was working; his enemies didn't seem to suspect anything, and he was drawing closer to his first objective.</p><p>As Qin Sang passed through the mud, his expectant gaze froze.  The scene before him was completely different from what he had anticipated.</p><p>There had once been a hidden realm here, with countless strands of light crisscrossing. These light strands were like琴弦 (qin xian - literally "qin strings"), emitting sounds upon contact, capable of damaging the soul and spirit of cultivators; the more one struggled, the greater the damage. This was where he could utilize the advantages of his jade Buddha.</p><p>Now, all the light strands had vanished.  The scenario he had most feared had come to pass.</p><p>Undeterred, Qin Sang continued his escape, soon arriving at a boundary, where he paused.</p><p>The area ahead was eerily silent, a rare occurrence in Panlong Cave at this time.  It wasn't completely dark; a faint, ethereal glow floated in the empty void, dreamlike in appearance.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated only a moment before rushing in, instantly causing a massive disturbance.  The area was riddled with ancient prohibitions, teetering on the brink of eruption. Qin Sang's intrusion was like throwing a stone into a lake, triggering immediate chaos.</p><p>Unaffected, Qin Sang sped through the prohibitions.  His pursuers arrived shortly after, watched for a moment, and then followed suit.</p><p>During his flight, Qin Sang glanced back.  Seeing no enemies, his gaze swiftly swept over the surrounding prohibitions. After a brief pause, he removed the Qianjun Ring from his hand and threw it forcefully.</p><p>The ring's light flickered before it fell into the depths of the prohibitions.  Qin Sang had already vanished into the distance, without looking back.  The ring, his constant companion for nearly two thousand years, had been discarded for the first time.</p><p>Soon, Xian Tong and Chong Yun arrived.</p><p>The more intruders, the more violent the disturbance became. Xian Tong sped past without noticing anything unusual, but Chong Yun, trailing behind, seemed to sense something. He paused abruptly, his cloud transforming into a giant face – that of the man in green robes.</p><p>The man in green robes gazed into the depths of the prohibitions, as if sensing something. A look of surprise flashed in his eyes.  He hesitated slightly, but instead of stopping, he increased his speed.</p><p>He then sent a voice transmission to Xian Tong: "Fellow Daoist Si, things are getting increasingly chaotic ahead. I almost lost track of him earlier.  Continuing this pursuit is not feasible."</p><p>Xian Tong sighed; he understood perfectly.  "Brother Tang, what's your strategy?" he asked.</p><p>"I do possess a secret technique that might trap him if successfully deployed. However, it's cumbersome and produces a massive spectacle, easily alerting him and allowing him to evade us. The chaotic energy here should mask the technique's effects. I might try it, but…"</p><p>The man in green's tone shifted. "...this technique can't be performed instantly; I need time."</p><p>Xian Tong frowned. "How long will you need, Brother Tang?"</p><p>"Not long. Once the technique is ready, I can immediately catch up! Fellow Daoist Si, just keep a close eye on him. Even if the technique fails, we'll only waste some time," the green-robed cultivator said.</p><p>Seeing the man in green's confident tone, Xian Tong hesitated before agreeing to his proposal.</p><p>The insect swarm halted, then retreated like a tide.  Shortly, the insect cloud returned to its previous position, rapidly contracting and reforming into the shape of the man in green.  The spiritual insects he’d left behind had vanished from his senses, apparently destroyed by the ancient prohibitions.</p><p>Time was pressing.  The man in green took a step, plunging into the depths of the prohibitions.  Looking at the empty void ahead, a look of astonishment flashed in his eyes.  He exclaimed in surprise, "There's actually a small pocket world!"</p><p>A flickering point of light, emitting a unique aura, floated in the void – a gateway to a hidden realm!</p><p>The gateway had clearly been revealed by the surrounding chaos.</p><p>He wouldn't have paid much attention to a typical small world; with their cultivation, the treasures of an ordinary small world would be unimpressive, likely just another cultivation site. Most small worlds are in their early stages of evolution, further diminishing their value.</p><p>But this was a sacred land, the place where the first signs appeared!</p><p>What did the presence of a pocket world here signify?</p><p>The thought sent a rush of excitement through the man in green. He was about to enter when he paused, raising an arm which transformed into a spiritual insect that flowed into the gateway.</p><p>He could sense everything the insect saw and heard.</p><p>"Such a thick fog!"</p><p>That was his first thought as the insect encountered a dense fog within the pocket world.  Given its location within the Heart Lake, it wasn't entirely unexpected.</p><p>Just as he was about to use the insect to explore, the man in green shuddered. He had sensed a peculiar aura.</p><p>Instantly, his face was filled with shock.</p><p>The origins of the sacred land were shrouded in numerous conflicting accounts, but certain secrets were known to some cultivators within. He knew that his clan's sacred land was connected to a celestial mountain, and that four others of comparable stature existed.</p><p>These celestial mountains contained unique vital energy.  It was rumored that the sacred land had places where this energy was collected—though not available to junior cultivators like himself. Legend had it that refining this energy benefited one's cultivation realm. He had once seen his ancestor, a Saint Realm powerhouse, playing a game with another Saint, using a vial of celestial mountain energy.</p><p>Following the aura, the insect sensed a mountain peak shrouded in mist, which sent another shockwave through the man in green.</p><p>“This mountain… this mountain… could it be…?”</p><p>The man in green muttered to himself, a possibility forming in his mind, unbelievable at first, then swiftly replaced by ecstatic joy.  His first thought was to claim the mountain for himself; his second, to keep its existence secret from everyone, including the celestial child and the black-robed cultivator.</p><p>Even a fragmented mountain of this nature would be invaluable!  And its appearance here might be connected to the previous omens.</p><p>“Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!”</p><p>No longer hesitating, the man in green stepped through the gateway, ready to claim the celestial mountain before the celestial child grew suspicious.</p><p>The world shimmered, and he found himself inside the pocket dimension. His smile instantly froze.  A young acolyte stood before him.  The acolyte, possessing a striking countenance and an unexpected composure, calmly said, “I have been awaiting you, friend, for some time.”</p><p>Simultaneously, two figures appeared behind the man in green: Qin Sang's physical form, and the thunder beast warrior, surrounded by crackling lightning.</p><p>Since his Cloud Wanderer sword had advanced to a post-heavenly spiritual treasure, Qin Sang had been pondering its use.  Keeping it locked away felt like a waste.  However, wielding the Cloud Wanderer would expose his identity as a disciple of Ziwei due to the unavoidable emanation of the killing talisman’s mark; this was the main reason he hadn't used it before.</p><p>But what if he could contain the emanation to a specific area, preventing any leakage?  The various isolating formations and restrictions weren’t reliable, but the Qianjun Ring was different.  The pocket dimension was a self-contained realm; outsiders couldn't sense anything within.</p><p>As Qin Sang's understanding of the pocket dimension deepened, he realized he could temporarily transform the Qianjun Ring back into a gateway. Plus, the pocket dimension itself was gradually recovering.  Acting here, provided he didn't exceed a certain limit, wouldn't trigger its destruction.  This plan seemed increasingly feasible.</p><p>If he failed, his secret would be exposed. The timing had to be precise, and he couldn't afford a mistake.  The Qianjun Ring had no power to subdue enemies; he couldn’t forcibly drag them into the pocket dimension; they had to walk in willingly.</p><p>Qin Sang considered it his ultimate trump card, to be used only as a last resort. Now, it was necessary. Thankfully, through careful planning, he had successfully lured his enemy.  After all, who would ever suspect a mere Nascent Soul cultivator of carrying a pocket dimension?</p><p>Greed is one of humanity’s greatest weaknesses, and cultivators are no exception.</p><p>*CRASH!*</p><p>Along with them came a heavenly thunderbolt, its power overwhelming, striking the man in green. High above, a butterfly's shadow flickered.</p><p>“A tribulation thunderbolt!”</p><p>The man in green was horrified, his mind reeling. But even more terrifying was the sight of the acolyte transforming into a sword beam.</p><p>He felt an unprecedented aura of terrifying sword power, descending upon him instantly. In an instant, his eyes and mind were filled with nothing but that sword light.  He had the illusion that the entire world vanished, leaving only the sword light—anyone targeted by it could not escape.</p><p>But his crisis was far from over.  Behind him, the thunder beast warrior erupted with lightning, its aura reaching its peak.  From within the lightning, a gigantic thunderous palm, with devastating force, struck out.</p><p>*BOOM… BOOM…*</p><p>The thunder shook the heavens, causing the entire pocket dimension to tremble violently.  A massive ball of lightning exploded within the dimension, right where the man in green stood. Even this dazzling light couldn't obscure the sword beam.</p><p>At that moment, the sword light dominated everything, piercing the thunder, cutting through space, and gently falling beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer appeared, a rare excitement on its usually calm face. This was its first time assisting Qin Sang in slaying a powerful foe since its transformation.</p><p>The lightning dissipated.</p><p>The man in green stood there, a sword scar on his forehead. A hummingbird-like spirit insect, his life essence, was visible within his skull, bisected by the sword.  Another sword mark ran across his body.</p><p>*WHOOSH!*</p><p>The man in green's body suddenly disintegrated, turning into countless insect corpses that rained down like falling leaves. With his life essence destroyed, he was truly dead.</p><p>Outside the pocket dimension…</p><p>After the man in green entered, a centipede-like spirit insect hovered nearby. This centipede was transparent, exuding no aura—a natural master of concealment.</p><p>Suddenly, its body trembled, and it turned to flee.  A hand appeared above it, pressing down, easily seizing the insect.</p><p>The transparent centipede struggled fiercely, but to no avail. Finally, it stiffened, motionless.</p>
