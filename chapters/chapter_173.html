<h1>**Chapter 166 – The Profound Earth Armor and the Underground Art**</h1><p>**Chapter 166 – The Profound Earth Armor and the Underground Art**</p><p>The sound of a sword howl resounded through the hall.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng flicked his fingers and a spirit sword that was around the size of his thumb shot out and flew out into the air. The spirit sword grew as it flew, and at the same time, a fiery-red sword aura suddenly exploded from its body and became incredibly sharp.</p><p>This sword was called the Crimsonflame Sword. The sword aura enveloped the spirit sword and hid its original appearance, but given that it bore such magnitude, even if it was not an extreme-grade Dharma artifact, it was at least a very meticulously refined high-grade Dharma artifact.</p><p>Bai Yunshan was consumed by hatred for the malevolent corpse. After he got his bearings, he did not hesitate to madly pump his spiritual energy into his wooden staff and then threw it with all his might. The wooden staff suddenly increased to several dozen times its original size while still in midair and became a verdant dragon-slaying tree that blotted out the sky and filled the hall, creating quite the spectacle as it struck the malevolent corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally used his Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword. The Ten Yama Banner was not appropriate to use around other people, and the Ebonywood Sword was put on hold in case he needed it against Wu Yuesheng.</p><p>Furthermore, their current battle formation was a tripod formation. If they encountered any dangerous situations, they could quickly provide assistance to each other. The malevolent corpse was trapped in the middle and surrounded, and they simply had to gradually wear down the malevolent corpse's baleful energy and wait for the right opportunity to kill it. There was no need to make haste, and the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword was quite sufficient.</p><p>Fiery-red sword aura, a wooden staff, and the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword - three attacks from three different directions struck nearly simultaneously and closed off all possible paths of escape. Even if the malevolent corpse was extremely fast, it had nowhere to run.</p><p>"Ah..."</p><p>The malevolent corpse's figure flashed repeatedly and scurried around in the narrow space. However, it was forced back each time by the relentless attacks and could not break out of the encirclement. It seemed as if it sensed the danger, and the expression and sounds it made began to take on a human-like anxiety, making it all the more sinister.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The malevolent corpse had nowhere to run and let out a ferocious roar at the three of them before it was immediately buried under various magic artifacts.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>A massive sound echoed through the hall and the entire hall trembled violently.</p><p>However, when the chaotic spiritual energy dissipated and the three of them saw the scene in the middle of the battlefield, the ease they had on their faces vanished, replaced by astonishment.</p><p>They saw that after enduring the combined attack, the malevolent corpse was only slightly disheveled, but otherwise entirely undamaged.</p><p>The baleful energy on its body had transformed into square-shaped black rocks of unknown origin, and these rocks swirled around its body without end. The three of them had destroyed the majority of the rocks in their joint attack, but the attack had also been mitigated by the rocks.</p><p>Moreover, after these black rocks were shattered, they would simply transform back into baleful energy and very quickly condense into new black rocks, tightly enveloping the malevolent corpse.</p><p>Thanks to these black rocks, the malevolent corpse had forcibly endured the three attacks. Even though it had a wound from being stabbed by sword aura, the baleful energy quickly healed it and it ended up being completely fine.</p><p>Although Qin Sang and Wu Yuesheng had both held back and not used their full power during the test, the combined power of their attacks was still not to be underestimated. Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the same realm who was armed with all kinds of magic artifacts and spells would have to deal with the situation seriously and would not dare to let down their guard in the slightest.</p><p>All three of them turned their gaze to the strange black rocks and their expressions differed.</p><p>"Could this be...the Profound Earth Armor?"</p><p>Wu Yuesheng looked at the black rocks hovering around the malevolent corpse and spoke with disbelief.</p><p>After hearing Wu Yuesheng say that, Qin Sang suddenly recalled a spell called "Profound Earth Armor." When he was choosing cultivation techniques at Baota Peak, he skimmed through many famous spells that Foundation Establishment cultivators could cultivate.</p><p>He did not have the money to buy them or the energy to cultivate so many of them, so he committed the spells' characteristics, weaknesses, and particularly their破解之法 to memory so that he would know himself and his opponents and be able to be victorious in any future battles.</p><p>Of these spells, the Profound Earth Armor was unavoidable and very famous.</p><p>The Profound Earth Armor was a spell that used earthen techniques and could only be cultivated by Foundation Establishment cultivators. It was very difficult to cultivate. Once cultivated, it could transform spiritual energy into armor to protect the entire body. Furthermore, cultivators could control the combination of the armor's plates as the situation required and instantaneously block all of their vital points, making it absolutely perfect for defense and without any weak points.</p><p>The black square-shaped stones floating around the malevolent corpse had a faint yellow hue to them and there were runes flashing on their bodies. They were like shields that revolved around the malevolent corpse with incredible agility.</p><p>Other than the color being black instead of earthen yellow, they were not much different from the Profound Earth Armor.</p><p>The Profound Earth Armor was incredibly practical, and there were quite a few cultivators who cultivated it. However, the fact that a malevolent corpse was able to use such a spell was incredibly strange, not to mention terrifying.</p><p>The malevolent corpse's strengths were limited to its corpse poison, baleful energy, and its powerful body that was not capable of feeling pain. Its tactics were simple, and thus the three cultivators were not particularly afraid of it despite how formidable it appeared to be.</p><p>But has anyone heard that an Evil Corpse would know how to cast magic spells?</p><p>Right at this moment, it was like Elder Bai suddenly recalled something, his complexion changing, and he said faintly, "Fellow Daoists, did you find that the Evil Corpse's movement technique seemed like some kind of escape technique?"</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Yuesheng were startled, and they recalled the previous scene and realized that Elder Bai's guess was probably correct.</p><p>The Evil Corpse's strength was not strong enough to overwhelm them. Even if its speed was fast, it would not be possible for them, the three Foundation Establishment cultivators, to remain completely oblivious, and they would not have been able to see it clearly.</p><p>If it was an escape technique, then that would make sense. There are countless escapist magic spells in the realm of self-cultivation. Among them, escape techniques that are covert and rarely known are not uncommon, so it would be normal if they had managed to hoodwink their Spiritual Perception.</p><p>"Yellow Earth Armor, along with an illusive escape technique..."</p><p>Wu Yuesheng's voice was a little hoarse. "What other magic spells will it know? Surely it won't be able to use magic tools too, right? Do we have to call it 'Fellow Daoist'?"</p><p>When he finished speaking, Wu Yuesheng gave a self-deprecating dry laugh.</p><p>Now, they no longer dared to view the Evil Corpse as a dead object. If it knew how to use all kinds of strange magic spells, then with its formidable body and fearsome corpse poison, it would be even more difficult to deal with than a cultivator of the same level.</p><p>The three of them looked at each other, their expressions all becoming a little more serious.</p><p>Just as the three of them were feeling uncertain and apprehensive, the Evil Corpse suddenly moved, once again using that unpredictable movement technique to instantly disappear from their sight.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng's complexion suddenly changed dramatically, and he hurriedly pinched a Seal Formula while the Crimson Flame Sword soared into the sky.</p><p>Next, they heard a crisp 'bang', and they saw the Evil Corpse's figure appear beneath the Crimson Flame Sword. The Ghostly Claw ruthlessly swatted at the Crimson Flame Sword, causing the spirit sword to tilt violently.</p><p>They had not put away their magic tools, and they had been secretly on their guard. However, Wu Yuesheng had not expected that the Evil Corpse would choose to attack the Crimson Flame Sword. Although he had reacted extremely quickly, the Crimson Flame Sword had still been grazed by the Evil Corpse's fingernails.</p><p>Several clearly visible emerald-green fingerprints appeared on the crimson sword body. The remaining corpse poison and baleful aura on the fingerprints seemed to be alive as they attached themselves to the Crimson Flame Sword and squirmed, rapidly devouring the sword's spiritual light and attempting to drill into the Crimson Flame Sword and corrode its true form.</p><p>Not only could the corpse poison injure people, but it could also damage magic tools!</p><p>When he saw this scene, Wu Yuesheng's expression became one of shock. He hurriedly poured all his strength into activating the spirit sword, which immediately erupted into blazing flames that fought back against the corpse poison.</p><p>The corpse poison was very quickly burned up by the flames, and fortunately, the Crimson Flame Sword was not damaged. However, Wu Yuesheng's heart was still pounding.</p>
