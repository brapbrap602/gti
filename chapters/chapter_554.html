<h1>Chapter 547:  Urging</h1><p>Chapter 547:  Urging</p><p>Due to the unique nature of the *Spirit Nurturing Sword Chapter*, in addition to the ebony sword, Qin Sang can also nurture a lifebound treasure in his dantian using the power of his Golden Core.</p><p>Thinking about this lifebound treasure, Qin Sang still doesn't know which one to refine.</p><p>He currently only knows how to refine four types of treasures: the Yin Xuan Pagoda and Yin Thunder Bead from the *Ancient Book of Yin Sha*, the Heavenly Sound Conch from the *All-Heaven Demon Sound*, and the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>The first three require matching cultivation techniques, so they're not being considered. The techniques treasured in Treasure Pagoda Peak are similar.</p><p>The Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring originally belonged to someone else, so it can't be used as a lifebound treasure unless Qin Sang destroys the Yin Ring and refines a new one.</p><p>“After I form my Golden Core, I’ll ask the Ancestor for guidance and help in choosing one…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>After forming his Golden Core, he will be able to meet the Nascent Soul Ancestor, Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Having been in the sect for nearly a hundred years, he has met many of the Golden Core cultivators of Shaohua Mountain, yet he has never met Dongyang Bo. In his mind, this ancestor is an extremely mysterious figure.</p><p>The thought of meeting Dongyang Bo made Qin Sang somewhat excited.</p><p>Sect cultivators can become Dongyang Bo's disciples after forming their Golden Cores, meaning he would have a Nascent Soul backer.</p><p>“I wonder if the Ancestor still remembers that insignificant cultivator who sold himself for foundation establishment years ago?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, remembering Morning Smoke Fairy.</p><p>So many years have passed, and he hasn't heard any news about Morning Smoke Fairy.  Even Master Ma Wu seems to have vanished, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Has she formed her Nascent Soul?</p><p>Logically, after forming a Nascent Soul, one would hold a Nascent Soul Grand Ceremony, inviting fellow cultivators to witness the event.</p><p>Qin Sang had this thought, then shook his head.</p><p>After that transaction, they had no further connection. Whether Morning Smoke Fairy formed her Nascent Soul or not has nothing to do with him.</p><p>Being sentimental will only bring trouble.</p><p>Today is the day to go to the Earth-Sinking Cave. Qin Sang put away the jade slip, left his cave dwelling, and flew towards the Earth-Sinking Cave.</p><p>The Flying Sky Yaksha emerged from the abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang skillfully checked the state of the Corpse Pill.</p><p>He has been back for almost two months, and the Flying Sky Yaksha's injuries have visibly improved. Some small cracks on the Corpse Pill have now healed.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently and ordered the Flying Sky Yaksha to sit cross-legged on the ground, continuing to treat its injuries.</p><p>…</p><p>Two hours later, Qin Sang returned to Shaohua Mountain. Just as he was about to return to his cave dwelling for cultivation, he suddenly found someone standing in front of his dwelling—Gao Yang, a disciple of Qi Yuan Shou.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Qin Sang quickened his pace, landing in front of Gao Yang, and said with a smile, “Disciple Brother Gao, what brings you here?  Did Master Qi let you leave the mountain?”</p><p>Qi Yuan Shou is in seclusion, and Gao Yang rarely leaves the mountain. They had only met once in the past two months.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang finished speaking, he noticed that Gao Yang looked somewhat uneasy.</p><p>Thanks to those two top-grade magical weapons, their relationship had always been good.</p><p>Gao Yang trusted Qin Sang very much, always addressing him as “Senior Brother” affectionately in their meetings.  Now, however, he looked very serious.</p><p>“Disciple Brother Gao, what happened?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked in a low voice, thinking that something might have happened to Qi Yuan Shou.</p><p>Gao Yang winked at Qin Sang, his expression unchanged. He cleared his throat and loudly said, “Senior Brother Qin, Master asked me to ask you why, after receiving the Xuanlu Guard assignment, you have not reported for duty, instead idling within the sect. Do you consider Master Qi's orders, the sect's rules, and the Xuanlu Pass military orders as nothing? You are ordered to immediately go to Xuanlu Pass without delay!”</p><p>After reprimanding Qin Sang on behalf of Qi Yuan Shou, Gao Yang's serious expression disappeared. He spoke softly about the reason, “Senior Brother, please don't blame me.  Earlier, Master called me to fetch a medicinal herb, and I casually mentioned that you had returned to the mountain. I don’t know why Master became so furious and immediately ordered me to urge you to report for duty at Xuanlu Pass.”</p><p>Qin Sang slapped his forehead. He had forgotten that he still had the Xuanlu Guard token given to him by Qi Yuan Shou.</p><p>He had accepted the token, planning to use his Xuanlu Guard identity to leave the pass and search for treasures, seizing the opportunity, after the Spiritual Tide ended.</p><p>Times have changed.</p><p>Now that he could form his Golden Core at any time, Golden Core cultivators didn't need to follow these rules. The Xuanlu Guard token was no longer needed. However, he didn't expect Qi Yuan Shou to reprimand him for this.</p><p>Thinking about this, Qin Sang realized that the Xuanlu Guard token was probably not easy to obtain. The token he possessed seemed to represent the leader's identity, but there weren't many such tokens within the Xuanlu Guard.</p><p>Xuanlu Pass is not dominated by Shaohua Mountain alone.</p><p>The token is related to whether one can enter the Ancient Immortal battlefield as quickly as possible to compete for resources. There must be many people vying for it. Qi Yuan Shou helped him obtain one, probably owing someone a favor.</p><p>However, he was ungrateful for the favor and didn't show up for almost two years. Qi Yuan Shou couldn't give Xuanlu Pass an explanation, hence the outburst of anger.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly asked, "Has Master Qi returned from seclusion?"</p><p>"Master left word that he's gone back into seclusion," Gao Yang shook his head.</p><p>"Alright, Junior Brother, when you return, tell Master Qi that I admit my wrongdoing and will go to Xuanlu Pass immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang changed his mind, deciding not to wait and set off immediately.</p><p>After forming his Golden Core, he no longer needed to rely on Qi Yuanshou, but he couldn't burn bridges and offend him unnecessarily, especially since Qi Yuanshou had his best interests at heart.</p><p>He still needed to maintain appearances and give Qi Yuanshou and the sect an explanation.</p><p>The reason he stayed was to wait for the Flying Night Rakshasa to recover.</p><p>Now that the Flying Night Rakshasa's injuries were improving, as long as he had enough earth-sha energy, he could treat its wounds at Xuanlu Pass just as well.</p><p>Qin Sang made a swift decision, bid farewell to Gao Yang, and immediately scoured the various markets, buying up all the lodestone he could find.  He then refined a large batch of Shao Yin magnetic bottles, filling them with earth-sha energy; his iron finger ring could hold them all anyway.</p><p>Then, he retrieved the Flying Night Rakshasa and headed straight for the Shangyuan Quiet Palace.</p><p>…</p><p>Shangyuan Quiet Palace.</p><p>Arriving at the Shangyuan Quiet Palace again, before Qin Sang even reached the mountain gate, he encountered several Foundation Establishment cultivators, all heading to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>In the southeastern region of the Xiaohan Domain, controlled by the righteous cultivators, only the Shangyuan Quiet Palace possessed an ancient teleportation array directly leading to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Everyone knew that the spiritual tide of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was nearing its end. Those cultivators hoping to try their luck were rushing to the battlefield.</p><p>The Shangyuan Quiet Palace offered convenient access; regardless of one's status, as long as a significant sum of spirit stones was paid, the teleportation array would be activated once enough people gathered.</p><p>Surrounding independent cultivators, sects, and family cultivators all had to follow the Shangyuan Quiet Palace's rules.</p><p>Upon entering the mountain gate, someone immediately guided them to temporary lodgings, explaining that the required number of people wasn't yet complete and would be by tomorrow evening.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat of a celebrity; not long after entering the mountain, he was recognized.</p><p>Fellow cultivators from their time on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield invited him, and he could not refuse their warm hospitality. He sat and discussed cultivation with them until noon the next day.</p><p>A message arrived; the teleportation array was about to activate.</p><p>Qin Sang bid farewell to everyone and flew toward the main hall.</p><p>Seeing the ancient teleportation array a second time, Qin Sang's understanding far surpassed his previous experience. He carefully observed how the Shangyuan Quiet Palace master activated the array and, combining his recent insights, gradually began to understand the principles involved.</p><p>However, very few ancient teleportation arrays existed in the world, leaving Qin Sang with no opportunities for practical application.</p>
