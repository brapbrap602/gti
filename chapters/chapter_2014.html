<h1>Chapter 2005: The World in White</h1><p>Emerging from the Small Teleportation Formation, Qin Sang saw beneath his feet a large, circular platform, forged entirely of dark iron.</p><p>The platform hung suspended in the heavens. Beyond its edge, a boundless sea of clouds stretched to the horizon, where distant mountains formed a continuous chain.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a colossal shadow looming overhead.  He looked up, and a celestial city filled his vision, a breathtaking fortress of steel!</p><p>It was Sky Mechanism City!</p><p>Before witnessing Sky Mechanism City with his own eyes, it was difficult to imagine such a wondrous city existing in the world of cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed upon the city's foundation, entirely constructed of metal.  Massive iron plates, interlocked by intricate mechanisms, formed a seamless whole. The joints between each piece of steel were clearly visible.</p><p>Countless man-made iron components, forged on a monumental scale, were tightly bound together, resembling a colossal aerial warship.</p><p>Eight iron pillars extended from the underside of this ‘warship,’ each rooted atop the summit of the surrounding majestic peaks.</p><p>Supported by these iron pillars, Sky Mechanism City lay across the crest of the cloud sea, high in the Ninth Heaven. It also resembled a gigantic mechanical beast—a steel spider—poised to stride forth on its eight legs at any moment.</p><p>Such an immense spider, with its incredibly long legs, could traverse even the towering mountains of Gen Province with ease.</p><p>Bathed in sunlight, the entire city shimmered with a metallic luster.  Even with his enhanced vision, Qin Sang could only barely discern the shadows of the iron pillars through the swirling mists.</p><p>The material of these iron components was far from ordinary. Qin Sang saw complex runes inscribed upon their surfaces, each meticulously refined by cultivators.</p><p>It was hard to fathom the amount of spiritual metal and manpower required to forge such a colossal city.</p><p>Qin Sang currently stood upon an iron disc extending from one of the steel pillars.</p><p>Countless similar discs, densely packed, lined the entire length of the pillar.  These housed not only Small Teleportation Formations but also various other functions.</p><p>His figure flickered, and he arrived at the disc's edge, catching a glimpse of the true Sky Mechanism City above the ‘warship.’</p><p>The lower half of Sky Mechanism City resembled a steel spider, while the upper half bloomed like an iron lotus.</p><p>The city’s inhabitants resided within this upper section. The city was not flat; petal-shaped iron plates, embedded in the main body, extended upwards and outwards.</p><p>These iron plates were incredibly thick and massive.  Each plate constituted a district of Sky Mechanism City, teeming with people and buildings.</p><p>All the iron plates combined to form an iron lotus, blooming in the heavens. Rough, hard, and sharp, it glittered under the sun, possessing a unique and unparalleled beauty.</p><p>At the edges of the ‘petals,’ countless black dots floated in the boundless void.</p><p>These dots were various iron birds and beasts ridden by cultivators, undoubtedly mechanical constructs.  A constant stream of cultivators entered and departed the city.</p><p>Unlike the lifelike Azure Tigers and Crimson Phoenixes of Radiant Gold City, these mechanical beasts were clearly metallic creations. Their steel shells gleamed, indestructible, rough, and cold.  The gaps in their armor revealed the intricate mechanisms within: gears, screws, bearings, connecting rods, chains…  Their movements produced a distinctive metallic symphony.</p><p>Iron birds flew into the city, landing directly on the edges of the petals. With a ‘click,’ their own mechanisms connected with Sky Mechanism City, seamlessly integrating and becoming part of the whole.</p><p>Of course, there were also cultivators who traversed the skies independently or rode spirit beasts.  However, those who rode mechanical beasts were not subjected to inspection and could enter and exit freely, suggesting some sort of established rule.</p><p>Besides the mechanical beasts, there were other means of entering the city.  Countless iron cages, suspended from the eight steel pillars and pulled by iron cables, traversed up and down, producing a constant rattling sound.</p><p>Below Sky Mechanism City, amidst the rolling mountains, there were also palaces, pavilions, and residences, where immortals and mortals lived together.  Situated beneath the city, they were not deprived of sunlight, presumably due to the workings of a grand formation.</p><p>A celestial city above, an iron spider bearing a golden flower!</p><p>Even though Qin Sang had heard numerous tales during his journey, he couldn’t help but marvel at the sight.  Sky Mechanism City was the most extraordinary celestial city he had ever seen in the cultivation world.  It stirred distant memories he had long forgotten, evoking a myriad of emotions.</p><p>He wondered if the capital cities of the Eight Great Celestial Provinces were all so magnificent and unique. What wonders awaited him in White Jade Capital?</p><p>Composing himself, Qin Sang entered an iron cage.  The pulleys whirred, and the cables rapidly pulled the cage upwards, carrying Qin Sang into Sky Mechanism City.</p><p>He didn't linger in Sky Mechanism City for long, taking only a cursory glance, eager to witness the Human Sacred Ground. A Grand Teleportation Formation connected Sky Mechanism City and White Jade Capital, allowing for instantaneous travel. He could return anytime he needed.</p><p>After inquiring about the location, Qin Sang found the residence responsible for teleportation.  A Deity Transformation stage steward received him.</p><p>The steward sized Qin Sang up, his expression turning serious. He rose and bowed, inquiring, “Senior Qin is a Void Refinement cultivator?”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, discerning the underlying meaning in the steward's question. He countered, "Is there a cultivation requirement for traveling to White Jade Capital?"</p><p>"Senior's insight is keen.  There are indeed requirements. The journey is long, and the Grand Teleportation Formation carries inherent risks. Generally, only those at the Void Refinement stage or above can ensure their safety.  Deity Transformation cultivators must either be accompanied by a Void Refinement cultivator, possess a token from a powerful figure, or meet certain special requirements. Otherwise, they cannot travel alone, and these requirements are exceedingly stringent. The cost of a single teleportation is also beyond the means of ordinary individuals.  This junior has yet to have the honor of visiting the Sacred Ground, and those below Deity Transformation have even less of a chance…"</p><p>Qin Sang inquired thoroughly, and the steward, not daring to offend him, patiently answered.</p><p>"I see.  Qin Mou wishes to depart as soon as possible. What is the cost?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>"The Grand Teleportation Formation is overseen by Senior Li. Senior, please follow me," the steward bowed slightly, leading Qin Sang deeper into the residence.</p><p>From the outside, it appeared to be a city of metal, but the interior boasted small bridges and flowing water, no different from the outside world, catering to individual preferences.</p><p>Passing through layers of restrictions, the steward led Qin Sang before an elderly man.</p><p>"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Li," Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>Faced with a potential patron, the elderly man surnamed Li was very enthusiastic, returning the greeting with a smile.  "Fellow Daoist Qin wishes to travel to White Jade Capital? What a coincidence! The Grand Teleportation Formation is scheduled to activate in one hour. Fellow Daoist, please take a look at this…"</p><p>He handed over a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it, his brow raising slightly.</p><p>As expected, spiritual stones were of little use here.  The slip listed various heavenly treasures and rare materials, including some relatively common ones, though in correspondingly larger quantities.</p><p>The trade convention at the Clear Sky Dharma Assembly, which used spirit treasures as entry tickets, was already exorbitant.</p><p>This was even more ruthless. Spirit treasures were acceptable, but their quality was scrutinized.  Shoddily crafted spirit treasures with inconsistent power were not accepted.</p><p>Qin Sang did possess heavenly materials and earthly treasures, acquired from the Clear Sky Dharma Assembly or selected from spoils of war, saved for future use.  Parting with any of them felt like a painful loss.</p><p>After careful consideration, using a spirit treasure was the most straightforward option.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved a spirit treasure called the Yuan Li Purifying Bowl. This treasure’s origins were unknown to Patriarch Ming Hu, from whom Qin Sang had obtained it. Among Ming Hu's possessions, its quality was second only to the Soul Obliterating Lamp and the Spirit Tablet.  Someone had expressed interest during the Clear Sky Dharma Assembly, but their offer was too low, and no deal was made.</p><p>With the Yuan Li Purifying Bowl gone, the only treasure remaining from Patriarch Ming Hu was the Spirit Tablet. This tablet, called the Spirit Sacrifice, was forged from countless souls and flesh, possessing the weight of ten thousand spirits, a treasure of immense power. Qin Sang planned to comprehend its mysteries thoroughly and keep it for his own use.</p><p>"It seems it's best to avoid this place in the future," Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Unless specific requirements for his divine abilities arose, crafting ordinary spirit treasures, although requiring more effort, couldn't withstand such exorbitant expenses.</p><p>After carefully examining the Yuan Li Purifying Bowl, the elderly man surnamed Li nodded in satisfaction. He gave Qin Sang a jade talisman and led him through a Small Teleportation Formation into another grand hall.</p><p>Entering the hall, Qin Sang felt a sudden tightening in his chest. The formation here was far more formidable than the previous one.</p><p>He calmly surveyed his surroundings. The hall was vast, with the formation situated in the center, shrouded in a dark mist, obscuring its true form.</p><p>At the edge of the mist, several figures sat or stood, all Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>Seeing the elderly man surnamed Li bring Qin Sang in, some nodded in greeting, while others merely glanced at him before looking away, their expressions indifferent.</p><p>"One hour remains. There should be no one else coming."</p><p>The elderly man surnamed Li stepped forward and said in a calm and unhurried tone, "Some of you may be traveling to White Jade Capital for the first time. Allow Li Mou to offer a few words of advice. During the teleportation, you must circulate your power to stabilize yourselves and resist the spatial turbulence. Once you arrive in White Jade Capital, the Grand Zhou Capital, the rules are stricter than in Gen Province. There will be personnel to guide you; simply follow their instructions…"</p><p>An hour passed quickly.</p><p>The elderly man surnamed Li stepped into the dark mist. A moment later, his voice emerged, "You may enter now."</p><p>Including Qin Sang, there were eight people in total.  Each activated their jade talisman and entered the mist from eight different directions.</p><p>Stepping into the mist, Qin Sang found himself surrounded by a hazy obscurity. Even with his Void Refinement cultivation, he couldn't see anything. He refrained from using his divine abilities to peer through the mist, took three steps, and stopped, waiting patiently.</p><p>After a period of silence, the elderly man surnamed Li performed some unknown action within the mist. Suddenly, Qin Sang felt a tremor beneath his feet, and a powerful wave erupted from the depths of the mist. Azure light swept outwards, instantly engulfing him.</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang felt himself bound by an immense force, pulled violently outwards. The mist vanished, and he was drawn into a bizarre and kaleidoscopic world, hurtling through streams of light, even transforming into a streak of light himself.</p><p>This space was filled with chaotic energy. The jade talisman emitted a series of cracking sounds before shattering, unleashing all its power.</p><p>Qin Sang could still feel the violent force crushing him, threatening to tear him apart or hurl him into the unknown. His mind flickered, and he summoned the Grey Warbler Sword. Sword intent enveloped him, its sharp edge pointing forward, cleaving through the turbulent currents!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>It felt like an eternity, yet also like the blink of an eye. The stream of light vanished without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled slowly, calming his agitated True Essence. Finding himself still within the mist, he heard voices coming from outside.  He stepped out of the mist and found himself surrounded by profound darkness.</p><p>The space was boundless, with void extending in all directions.</p><p>They stood upon a suspended white jade platform. From the platform, dozens of jade steps extended, leading to unknown destinations.</p><p>At the edge of the platform stood golden-armored guards, protecting the area.  Astonishingly, they were all Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>"Senior, please follow me," a golden-armored guard stepped onto a jade staircase, gesturing for Qin Sang to follow.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly glanced around and followed closely.  As expected, the end of the jade staircase was heavily restricted.  Qin Sang entered the restriction, offering no resistance. He felt the space distort around him as he was teleported away.  Suddenly, brilliant light flooded his vision.</p><p>His view widened dramatically.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself standing on a mountaintop, surrounded by a vast, boundless plain.  His vision was almost unobstructed, stretching to the horizon where rolling hills finally appeared.</p><p>This was a fertile land, dotted with houses, crisscrossed by roads, and filled with the sounds of human activity.  Millions upon millions of people resided here.</p><p>Beneath Qin Sang's feet lay the only mountain in the plain, majestic and towering, reaching towards the heavens, a sight befitting a Sacred Ground!</p><p>This mountain was the Human Sacred Ground—Jade Capital Mountain!</p><p>Standing atop Jade Capital Mountain, the sun, moon, and stars felt within reach.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's eyes, the clear blue sky concealed a boundless sea of clouds, hidden from mortal sight.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around.  Behind him stood a tall white jade platform.  Atop the platform was a statue, seemingly immense, its base hidden beneath the sea of clouds.</p><p>He slowly ascended towards the clouds, feeling himself pass through an invisible barrier.  As he emerged above the cloud sea, the scene transformed.</p><p>The first thing that caught his eye was a tall and imposing white jade statue, equal in height to Jade Capital Mountain, its feet planted on the sacred mountain, its head reaching the heavens.</p><p>The statue depicted a man clad in snow-white robes, hands clasped behind his back, gazing into the distance. He possessed an otherworldly grace and supreme authority, his eyes filled with the weariness of ages, as if concerned for the future of humanity. His hands, clenched into fists, also seemed determined to forge a path forward for humankind.</p><p>No introduction was needed. From ancient times to the present, only one person could possess such honor and such bearing: the Jade Emperor!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned solemn as he paid his respects.  Shifting his gaze, he saw a vast plaza formed by the sea of clouds, teeming with cultivators.</p><p>In the north of the cloud sea lay a magnificent celestial palace.</p><p>Clouds and mist swirled around it, imbued with immortal energy, where immortals came and went.</p><p>Countless majestic palaces, with glazed tiles and golden beams, shone brilliantly.</p><p>Above the white clouds, layer upon layer, rose towering pavilions, a breathtaking sight: the Thirty-Three Heavenly Palaces!</p><p>White Jade Capital!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled his experiences in the Divine Court.  That was a Daoist’s fantasy of the Celestial Court, encompassing the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Constellations, all-encompassing and magnificent.  The White Jade Capital before him, however, was real, a true celestial palace.</p><p>As he admired the palace, Qin Sang noticed something amiss.</p><p>Everyone in White Jade Capital wore white bands, and every household hung white silk, creating a somber and solemn atmosphere.</p><p>"The Zhou King has reached the end of his lifespan, his dragon carriage has ascended to the heavens. The world is draped in white!"</p><p>A voice suddenly spoke nearby, its tone heavy with grief.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. The Zhou King had passed away!</p><p>When did this happen? There had been no indication in Sky Mechanism City.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang realized something was wrong.</p><p>After reaching Void Refinement, lifespan became endless.  Death was usually caused by heavenly tribulation or unforeseen accidents. The term 'end of lifespan' was rarely used.  What was the Zhou King's cultivation level?</p><p>Qin Sang turned to see the speaker standing beside him. Looking at his face, it was one of the golden-armored guards from before.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man, his appearance unfamiliar.  Yet, for some reason, Qin Sang felt a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>“This old servant greets True Man!”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could ask, the man transmitted his voice, his tone familiar and respectful, "Master has ordered this old servant to wait here for True Man!"</p>
