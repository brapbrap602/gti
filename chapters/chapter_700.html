<h1>Chapter 692: A Long Journey</h1><p>“Since you two fellow Daoists haven't been out long, you must have made ample preparations and haven't used much of your丹药 and other supplies, right? I've just run out of supplies and would like to trade demon corpses and demon cores for some. What do you think?”</p><p>Qin Sang kept his promise and tossed them a top-grade magical artifact, then suddenly had the idea to trade with them.</p><p>The senior disciple asked in surprise, "Aren't you planning to return to Cliff Rock Island to take shelter?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I came to the Demon Sea to hunt demons and gather cultivation resources. I'm afraid that if I go back, I'll be trapped on the island and unable to leave. I'm alone, unlike you two fellow Daoists who have so many disciples and can come and go as you please. I've decided to stay out here for a few more years and see how things go. Trading your丹药 for demon cores will also prevent your trip from being wasted."</p><p>After a brief discussion, the two agreed to trade with Qin Sang. Following some bargaining, they threw him a storage pouch. Qin Sang tossed them several demon cores at the same time, wary of their potential greed.</p><p>After checking the contents of the storage pouch, Qin Sang cupped his hands. "Farewell, fellow Daoists!"</p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p>The two returned the gesture, their tone much softer than before.</p><p>"Oh, right," Qin Sang was about to leave when he suddenly remembered something and turned back. "The area around Cliff Rock Island seems unstable. The patrolling cultivators are nowhere to be seen. You two should be careful."</p><p>The senior disciple was startled. "Thank you for the warning…"</p><p>……</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his flying light and soared into the sky.</p><p>After making sure no one was following him, he landed on a deserted island and transferred the items from the storage pouch into his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Those two were very well-prepared. With these supplies, he wouldn't have to worry about running out of resources even if he stayed in the Demon Sea for a few more years, giving him much more flexibility.</p><p>"The place where we fought earlier wasn't far from Cliff Rock Island. If the five of them were careful, they should have already entered Cliff Rock Island and reported the situation to Ran Luo. If Ran Luo sends people out to meet them, should I go back and contact them proactively?"</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, stroking his chin as he pondered his next move.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang decided not to contact them.</p><p>After learning about the conflict between the two races and the lockdown of Cliff Rock Island, Qin Sang made up his mind almost immediately not to return to the island until the chaos subsided.</p><p>That was why he traded with those two, ensuring he had enough supplies to operate alone in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Having experienced the war between the Small Cold Realm and the Heavenly March Alliance, and having been on the front lines for five years, he knew very well how terrifying wars between cultivators could be.</p><p>This was true even for Foundation Establishment cultivators, and the battles between Golden Core experts were even more unpredictable.</p><p>In the Small Cold Realm, as a disciple of Lesser Hua Mountain, and because of his need to comprehend the Killing Talisman, he had no choice.</p><p>Now, things were different. He could comprehend the Killing Talisman by hunting demons. He had been accidentally transported here and had no deep ties with either the human or witch factions of the Roiling Sea.</p><p>Cliff Rock Island, with its Nascent Soul cultivator, seemed very stable.</p><p>However, if the war escalated, it was likely that no one from either the human or witch race would be able to stay out of it. Cliff Rock Island, as a larger target, would be even more vulnerable. Lin Hai's wish to seal off the island and stay out of the conflict was delusional.</p><p>When that happened, the cultivators on the island would be forced into the fight, obeying Lin Hai's orders, and Qin Sang would have to side with the humans.</p><p>Although he wasn't a Roiling Sea cultivator, his human identity left him with no other choice.  In such times, being a fence-sitter was the quickest way to die.</p><p>Qin Sang was merely an outer sea retainer of the Vast Expanse Trading Company. He had no foundation on Cliff Rock Island, no powerful backers, and the most dangerous missions would surely fall to him.</p><p>Why jump into the fire pit on his own?</p><p>Now, it seemed that being ambushed was actually a good thing, allowing him to conveniently detach himself from Cliff Rock Island.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang decided not to contact the Vast Expanse Trading Company for now, letting them assume he was missing.  He would have an excuse if they met again in the future. This way, he could avoid being forced to do anything by the Vast Expanse Trading Company or Cliff Rock Island and avoid a direct confrontation.</p><p>Qin Sang had a good impression of the Vast Expanse Trading Company and wanted to maintain that connection.</p><p>"Where should I go next? Should I go directly to Boundless Island and search for the Quehuo Sparrow? I wonder what the situation on Boundless Island is like now. Before the chaos erupted, one could take a boat to Boundless Island, but now I'm afraid I can only fly there myself. Fortunately, Boundless Island and Cliff Rock Island are not far apart, separated only by a large island. With the protective talisman, I don't have to worry..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the southwest and muttered to himself.</p><p>He had originally planned to go there after collecting the Jiao Souls.</p><p>The Primordial Concentric Rings could provide warnings, which was very useful in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Especially now, with the chaos between the two races, he could foresee that he would have to wander alone in the Demon Sea for the next few years.  He might even have to hide in the depths of the Demon Sea to avoid the war. The importance of the Primordial Concentric Rings was becoming increasingly apparent.</p><p>"The sooner I refine the Primordial Concentric Rings, the sooner I can hunt demons with peace of mind. If things get completely chaotic and even the safe sea areas become uninhabitable, I can just hide in the depths of the Demon Sea. I won't get involved in this mess..."</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang made his decision.</p><p>Before setting off, he would find a place to repair those few magical treasures, which would increase his chances of survival.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang adjusted his breath slightly, found a nearby small island with a spiritual vein, set up a spirit-locking formation, and devoted himself to studying the Golden Radiance Armor and other magical treasures.</p><p>A month later, Qin Sang deactivated the formation and flew away from the island on his sword, heading towards Boundless Island.</p><p>He now wore an inner armor.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and pressed his chest, feeling the power of the Golden Radiance Armor, a smile appearing on his face. Then, with a flash in his eyes, he stored the armor in his dantian.</p><p>Over the past month, Qin Sang had worked tirelessly, using up a lot of demon bones and spiritual materials, and finally found a way to repair the cracks in the Golden Radiance Armor.</p><p>However, the spiritual nature damaged by the Blood Defilement Divine Light had not fully recovered and required further nurturing.</p><p>Qin Sang flew at a low altitude, maintaining a certain distance from the sea surface to avoid being caught off guard by sudden demon beast attacks.</p><p>His eyes were alert, ensuring that no one was watching him, before he took out a map of the Demon Sea.</p><p>"The sea routes are probably not safe now, and I can't follow them completely. But the sea routes are charted paths where the demon beasts are not too powerful. Outside of them, dangers lurk everywhere, so I can't deviate too far..."</p><p>Qin Sang put away the map, having made up his mind. He adjusted his direction slightly, his figure gradually disappearing into the depths of the sea.</p><p>……</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>A streak of white light descended from the sky and landed on a deserted island. As the light dissipated, it revealed the figure within: Qin Sang, his face weary from the long journey.</p><p>For this entire journey, Qin Sang had been using flying magical artifacts or his sword to travel.</p><p>He still remembered the scene in the Small Cold Realm where Daoist Xuan Yu rode the Jiao Dragon spirit in such a carefree manner. That way, he wouldn't have to expend too much mental energy, only needing to focus a sliver of his divine sense on the Jiao Dragon spirit, even allowing him to cultivate simultaneously.</p><p>With dangers lurking everywhere in the Demon Sea, Qin Sang didn't dare to be so careless and had to do everything himself.</p>
