<h1>Chapter 2080: A Stone Cast into the Lake</h1><p>King Jinchan stayed at Green Ram Temple for over ten days before departing. Shortly after his leave, another visitor arrived – none other than Sect Master Mu of the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>The cultivation methods of the Hundred Flowers Valley originated from the Wu Clan. Due to their incompatibility with human physiology, achieving higher realms was challenging, and they encountered bottlenecks earlier than other sects. Upon learning of the Wu Clan's migration, Sect Master Mu decisively relocated her entire sect to the Central Continent, establishing their new mountain gate near the Wu Clan's territory.</p><p>The Wu Clan, the weakest of the three clans, sought to cultivate a close human ally, and the Hundred Flowers Valley was precisely what they needed.</p><p>With Elder Fang's approval and the Wu Clan's support, the Hundred Flowers Valley finally deduced a complete Nascent Soul cultivation method.  Sect Master Mu, leveraging this breakthrough, achieved Deity Transformation, and the Hundred Flowers Valley's status among human sects steadily rose.</p><p>Despite having the entire Wu Clan's backing, the Hundred Flowers Valley didn't produce a wave of exceptional cultivators.  Sect Master Mu's cultivation seemed stagnant for years, making the valley's reputation in the Tempest Realm somewhat inflated.  Outsiders speculated that this was due to an incomplete cultivation method.</p><p>“Welcome, Sect Master Mu!”</p><p>Due to Qin Sang's connection with the Hundred Flowers Valley, Li Yufu and Sect Master Mu maintained a cordial relationship.</p><p>Both sides carefully nurtured this connection, with frequent exchanges between their disciples. However, the Hundred Flowers Valley represented the Wu Clan externally, prioritizing the clan's interests in all matters, precluding a formal alliance with the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Nevertheless, perhaps due to Qin Sang's influence, Elder Fang never deliberately opposed them unless the Wu Clan's interests were directly involved.</p><p>Sect Master Mu laughed heartily. “Upon hearing of True Monarch's intention to rebuild the mountain gate, Elder Fang instructed me to inquire if you require any assistance.”</p><p>As he spoke, his gaze swept across the mountain peaks. Although his vision wasn't as keen as True Monarch Hegao or King Jinchan, he could still discern the extraordinary formations at play.</p><p>“Indeed, there's a matter I wish to discuss with Sect Master Mu and Elder Fang…”</p><p>Li Yufu warmly invited Sect Master Mu into the main hall and reiterated his previous proposal.</p><p>A while later, Sect Master Mu emerged from the palace with a grave expression.  Bowing his hands to Li Yufu, he said, “This matter is of great importance. I must inform Elder Fang immediately. I'll take my leave now and visit again another day.”</p><p>“Farewell, Sect Master Mu!”</p><p>Li Yufu escorted Sect Master Mu beyond the mountains, standing on the clouds as he watched the departing streak of light.</p><p>Like a chess piece dropped onto a calm lake, the Green Ram Temple's reconstruction had already stirred ripples throughout the Tempest Realm.</p><p>Their foundation was in the North Sea.  Previously, they held the moral high ground, relying on strength and prestige to unite various factions and suppress ambitious forces. Now, with Fairy Liu Li in secluded cultivation and the Green Ram Temple preoccupied, their ally in the Central Continent, the Four Saints Palace, began to withdraw.  Those with ambitions, sensing an opportunity, would likely begin to reveal themselves.</p><p>His martial uncle clearly intended to eradicate these issues once and for all, lancing the boil and scraping the poisoned bone. He hoped Elder Fang would remain calm and make a wise choice, otherwise, he didn’t know how many more blows the Wu Clan could withstand.</p><p>From now on, they only needed to focus on developing their mountain gate, calmly observing the unfolding events from their vantage point!</p><p>Li Yufu gazed deeply into the distance before turning and flying back to the palace.</p><p>…</p><p>East Sea.</p><p>Boundless azure waves stretched to the horizon.</p><p>After leaving Green Ram Temple, Guihou first toured the Central Continent, primarily out of curiosity about his master's connection to this place. Since his master hadn’t given explicit instructions, he wasn't in a hurry. After all, there was no one in the entire Tempest Realm who could rival him.</p><p>Flying leisurely over the sea, enjoying the cool breeze, Guihou noticed an island in the distance. His expression shifted slightly as he flicked a finger, sending out an inconspicuous ripple of energy.</p><p>Waiting patiently, he heard laughter carried by the sea breeze. “Brother Gui, what an honor! Why not grace my island with your presence? Allow me to host a banquet and express my gratitude.”</p><p>The figure of the Black Lion Saint King materialized from the void.</p><p>When Qin Sang had introduced them, the Black Lion Saint King hadn't known Guihou's true cultivation. However, as his master’s subordinate, he naturally dared not underestimate him, displaying fervent enthusiasm.</p><p>Thinking about how the demon cultivators here dared to call themselves Great Saints and Saint Kings with their meager cultivation, Guihou couldn't help but sneer inwardly.  A bunch of frogs in a well, unaware of the vastness of the heavens. Just wait and see how his master deals with them!</p><p>Maintaining a calm demeanor, he smiled. “My master has commanded me not to reveal my identity, so it's best to be cautious. I’ve come to visit Brother Black Lion to request your assistance with a certain matter.”</p><p>“Speak freely, Brother Gui!”</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King waved his hand magnanimously.</p><p>Guihou bowed. “Then I thank Brother Black Lion in advance. Once the matter is concluded, I will surely commend you to my master.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Black Lion Saint King became even more eager, urging Guihou to speak. Guihou then asked, “Brother Black Lion, you should have some informants planted among the demon clans of the Demon Sea, correct?”</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King’s eyes flickered, instinctively wanting to conceal the truth. However, he immediately realized that such attempts were pointless. Nodding, he readily admitted, "Brother Gui, do you have a use for them? Here is my token. Present this, and they will obey your commands. If any dare to disobey, feel free to eliminate them!"</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King produced a bronze demon token, which Guihou accepted without hesitation. Subjugating subordinates wouldn’t be difficult for him, but starting from scratch wouldn't be as efficient as utilizing the Black Lion Saint King's established network.</p><p>Having come specifically for this purpose, with the token in hand, he bid farewell to the Black Lion Saint King.</p><p>“Hold on, Brother Gui!”</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King hastily stopped him, bowing deeply.  “To be honest, Brother Gui, ever since I last saw your master, I've been filled with anxiety, eager to share his burdens and atone for my past transgressions.  However, I'm unsure what to do to earn his favor.  I feel lost.”</p><p>Guihou glanced at him, noticing his sincere attitude. Stroking his chin, he asked, “Do you think it difficult for my master to control those treacherous scoundrels?”</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King was taken aback.  “What are you saying, Brother Gui? They are mere insignificant ants.  Your master could crush them with a single finger!”</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>Guihou clapped his hands and laughed.  “The outcome is predetermined.  No matter how hard you try, it won’t affect the overall situation, nor will it improve the result. If you make a mistake and disrupt my master's plans, it will only invite punishment. Why bother?”</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King’s face fell.  “But I can't just stay idle in my cave all day, doing nothing!”</p><p>“I understand your fervent enthusiasm, Brother Black Lion, but you must direct it appropriately. Do you know what my master truly cares about?” Guihou’s tone became mysterious.</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King’s eyes lit up.  “Please enlighten me, Brother Gui!”</p><p>“Eliminating internal threats, even eradicating the Changyou Clan, is but a trivial matter for my master.  But beyond the Changyou Clan, there are other foreign tribes, and above the Imperial Tribes are the Superior Tribes, all potential enemies. Without the strength to defend against external foes, how can we act rashly?” Guihou spoke meaningfully.</p><p>“Brother Gui, are you saying your master possesses even greater methods, capable of confronting all foreign tribes?”</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King gulped, this exceeding his imagination.  “I wonder what…”</p><p>Guihou interrupted him. “You don't need to know what it is right now, Brother Black Lion. Just know that my master is about to construct a type of altar, an altar of great significance. This is what my master values most.  From what I understand, his next step is to reclaim the Demon Sea and the Canglang Sea, where he will undoubtedly establish these altars. Not every location is suitable for altar construction. If we can survey and make preparations in advance, wouldn't that save my master considerable effort?”</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King’s eyes grew brighter with each word, feeling as if the clouds had parted. Guihou was his guiding light. He immediately expressed his willingness to assist Guihou, but Guihou waved him off.</p><p>“You haven't grasped the key point, Brother Black Lion!”</p><p>Guihou sighed, deciding to be blunt.  “My master will require a vast workforce to construct these altars, with branch altars across all domains, built simultaneously.  The Demon Sea and Canglang Sea are unclaimed. Who will oversee their construction? If you can train an elite force, and we cooperate closely, would my master entrust this task to anyone else?”</p><p>"Brother Gui's guidance has opened my eyes!"</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King bowed in admiration.</p><p>“Here are some of my insights regarding the altar. You can start by gathering some trusted elite commanders and train them in this direction, awaiting the opportune moment.”</p><p>Guihou produced a jade slip.</p><p>The Black Lion Saint King accepted it, treasuring it in his hands.</p><p>“Please excuse me, Brother Black Lion. I must be going!”  Guihou transformed into a streak of light, vanishing in an instant.</p><p>Flying westward, a smile played on Guihou’s lips.</p><p>He didn’t understand why his master was reluctant to decisively eliminate the demon cultivators, either by eradication or enslavement.</p><p>Since his master chose this course of action, there must be a deeper meaning. He was considering the situation after the Demon Sea's reclamation.  Even if his master released some demon clans, he would need to appoint someone trustworthy to manage them.</p><p>Besides Luohou and himself, who else was qualified?</p><p>If he could secure this position, he wouldn't be confined to the altar anymore.</p><p>Guihou’s eyes gleamed, hoping those fellows would cause even more chaos!</p><p>…</p><p>While Guihou was meeting with the Black Lion Saint King, King Jinchan also entered the East Sea. After flying for a while across the vast ocean, he arrived at an island, revealing his form and announcing loudly, “Fellow Daoist Longjing, are you present?”</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder, immediately causing a commotion.</p><p>Demonic Qi surged from the island, where countless demon soldiers were stationed.  Accompanied by shouts and commands, squads of demon soldiers rushed out, their demonic Qi swirling, banners fluttering like a forest.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>A commanding voice echoed from the island. The demon soldiers obeyed instantly, withdrawing in perfect order and clearing a path.</p><p>King Jinchan flicked his sleeve and flew onto the island, complaining, “Fellow Daoist, you have far too many palaces.  It took me quite some time to find you!”</p><p>“What brings King Jinchan to my humble abode?” Saint King Longjing asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“To request a rare medicinal ingredient!”</p><p>King Jinchan replied frankly.</p><p>At the center of the island, a resplendent golden palace occupied the entire mountain peak. Inside the palace, King Jinchan and Saint King Longjing sat opposite each other at a massive golden table, attended by several beautiful fish-women.</p><p>The oppressive aura of the two demon kings was terrifying, causing the fish-women to tense their faces, trembling with fear.</p><p>After learning which spiritual herb King Jinchan sought, Saint King Longjing nodded and summoned a subordinate. “Go to the Yuanluo Palace and retrieve this herb for King Jinchan!”</p><p>“Yes, Your Majesty!”</p><p>The demon immediately departed to carry out the order.</p><p>King Jinchan sighed.  “You’re quite imposing, Fellow Daoist!  A Saint King, commanding others at will.”</p><p>After transforming into his human form, Saint King Longjing stood nearly two zhang tall, wearing a golden crown. He was tall and powerfully built, with arms like iron rods, a heavy chain wrapped around his right arm.</p><p>His large, bell-like eyes fixed on King Jinchan. “King Jinchan, you’re not here just for medicine.  What’s your true purpose?  Speak plainly!”</p><p>King Jinchan spread his hands.  “I truly came for the spiritual herb. Fellow Daoist, dominating the East Sea, living a carefree life, all treasures within your grasp.  Our territory, before the Heavenly Change, was barren land, wedged between human territories, constantly under scrutiny. Even finding a single spiritual herb is difficult.”</p><p>Saint King Longjing’s expression remained unchanged, clearly not believing his words.</p><p>King Jinchan paused, then smiled meaningfully. “However, on my way here, I witnessed some… interesting things…”</p><p>Seeing Longjing’s lack of reaction, he wasn’t annoyed, instead asking, “Are you aware that Green Ram Temple is rebuilding its mountain gate?”</p><p>“I’ve heard something of it.”</p><p>Saint King Longjing replied.</p><p>“You’ve likely not seen Green Ram Temple’s protective formation. It’s truly extraordinary.”  King Jinchan’s face showed admiration as he vividly described his observations at Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Saint King Longjing listened quietly, finally offering a bland assessment.  “That's the demeanor of a true prominent sect. Their previous setup felt cramped. Every time I visited Deerfield, I felt stifled.”</p><p>“While the spiritual formation is powerful, it's also complex, demanding a significant investment of Green Ram Temple’s resources.  Listening to Sect Master Li, it seems Fairy Liu Li won't be emerging from seclusion to assist.  Completing the formation alone will be no easy feat for Green Ram Temple. In my opinion, just the final stage could take several years, perhaps even a decade or more, tying up the entire sect.”</p><p>King Jinchan shook his head, pessimistic about Green Ram Temple's prospects.  "Sect Master Li claims they're pooling the entire sect's strength, but after careful consideration, I believe it may not be enough.  They’ll likely need to enlist external aid."</p><p>Saint King Longjing looked deeply at King Jinchan, his eyelids drooping slightly. “Establishing a mountain gate is a major undertaking for any sect. It's only natural for Green Ram Temple to be cautious. As long as they don't start a war with the Changyou Clan and don't disrupt the larger situation, whatever Green Ram Temple does is of no concern to me.  Do you intend to reject Sect Master Li’s proposal?”</p><p>King Jinchan had been observing Saint King Longjing's reaction since he started speaking, but seeing his impassive expression, unable to discern anything, he inwardly cursed the old fox.  Laughing dismissively, he said, "Fellow Daoist, you know full well that King Jiaolong makes these decisions. I'm merely a messenger.  King Jiaolong will discuss any thoughts he has with you."</p><p>At this point, King Jinchan remembered something and complained, “Shouldn’t you establish a method of contact in the Western Lands, Fellow Daoist? Previously, we could only send talismans to you, which not only delayed communication but also risked missing crucial moments. We are both of the demon race and should cooperate.  I don't understand your apprehension."</p><p>Saint King Longjing gave a noncommittal nod.</p><p>King Jinchan couldn't fathom Saint King Longjing’s thoughts, though he was accustomed to this.  Changing the subject, he spoke of other matters, to which Saint King Longjing occasionally responded.</p><p>It was as if they were simply engaging in casual conversation.</p><p>After waiting a while longer, the Saint King sent to retrieve the herb returned.</p><p>King Jinchan accepted the spiritual herb and rose.  "Thank you for the medicine, Fellow Daoist. I’m eager to return to seclusion, so I won’t impose any further. Farewell!" (End of Chapter)</p>
