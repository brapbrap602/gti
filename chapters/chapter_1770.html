<h1>Chapter 1761: Outside</h1><p>The Daoist’s expression was calm.</p><p>“Friend Daoist, if you agree, you needn’t do anything to earn my gratitude. Afterwards, I will surely visit to thank you.  If you betray me to my enemies, at most they will ruin my plans, they cannot kill me, but you will gain a powerful enemy.  I believe you can weigh the pros and cons.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me?” Qin Sang narrowed his eyes.</p><p>The Daoist opened his mouth to speak, but his brow furrowed suddenly. His sword trembled, instantly making eight strikes around himself.</p><p>Eight sword beams were extremely sharp, but they only cut a foot around the Daoist before transforming into sword energy.  Then countless strands of sword energy vanished into nothingness, their whereabouts unknown.</p><p>The Daoist looked at Qin Sang, his tone neither angry nor pleased.  “I didn't expect Friend Daoist to be so skilled in using poison. This poison is quite extraordinary.  Though I've never seen it before, I know that if it enters the body, the outcome is likely to be fatal. Fortunately, I have some skill in transforming my sword, able to change all things with a single strike. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to detect.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression remained unchanged when his method was discovered.  He was secretly amazed.  Upon sensing the ambush, he had activated the poison bead, releasing the poison secretly.  This poison was derived from the blood-sucking瘴灵, an extraordinary toxin.</p><p>But it was discovered so quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an invisible force within the poison. It was the Daoist's sword energy merging with the toxin, even showing signs of dispersing and absorbing it.</p><p>This poison, remember, came from a five-transformation spirit insect, even if just its corpse.</p><p>This person's swordsmanship was unparalleled in Qin Sang's experience. At least among Yuan Ying stage cultivators, Qin Sang had never seen anyone who could match him.</p><p>If Elder Qingzhu hadn't perished, and had reached the peak of the Yuan Ying stage, perhaps he could barely reach such a level.</p><p>This made Qin Sang even more vigilant.</p><p>The poison was actually a test.</p><p>Qin Sang had secretly prepared the Heaven-Severing Soul-Destroying Needles. After considering it, he finally put away his divine ability and silently urged the poison bead.</p><p>The poison in the air receded.</p><p>If the needles missed, it would be a situation of mutual destruction.</p><p>The fact that the opponent was hindered didn't mean he couldn't use his full strength. Qin Sang judged that in his current state, he shouldn't engage in a life-or-death battle with a top-tier expert.</p><p>If it was truly a misunderstanding, attacking without seeing any benefit would be unwise.</p><p>Besides this, Qin Sang had another concern.</p><p>Xing Valley was the place with the most concentrated star essence he had found so far. Even if it couldn't lead to a direct breakthrough, he could use it for help later and increase the chances of success.</p><p>He didn't know how Xing Valley was formed. A fight with the Daoist could potentially destroy this precious place.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang withdraw his power, the Daoist nodded with a smile, made a sword gesture, and his spiritual sword reappeared from the void, flying into his sleeve.</p><p>Then, the Daoist flicked a finger, and a stream of light flew toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang used his true essence to catch it and saw that it was a golden token.</p><p>“Friend Daoist, if you seek me, activate the restriction within the token at Crane Cry Mountain,” the Daoist briefly explained the token's use and swore an oath.</p><p>Qin Sang casually put it into his storage ring and said indifferently, “I fear that what I seek, Friend Daoist cannot provide.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The Daoist became interested. “Please tell me.”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Daoist, seeming to be thinking. After a moment, he asked, “Dare I ask what sect's expert you are?”</p><p>What did he want?</p><p>Undoubtedly, it was cultivation techniques!</p><p>In this world, one needed cultivation techniques to cultivate.</p><p>With this Daoist's cultivation level, his status within a sect must be high.  Like the Xuanji Sect, it only had one Nascent Soul stage sect master.</p><p>He wondered if this person had the authority to use the sect's resources to impart cultivation techniques to outsiders.</p><p>The Daoist shook his head slightly.  “It's not that I dare not reveal my identity to you… I am unattached to any sect.”</p><p>Unattached to any sect?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.  “Friend Daoist, are you a Daoist Court official?”</p><p>The Daoist Court was immensely powerful; what power he hadn't even heard of would dare to hunt down a Daoist Court official?</p><p>“Who said I must be a member of the Daoist sect?”</p><p>The Daoist asked back.</p><p>He called himself a Daoist, yet claimed not to be a member of a Daoist sect, which sounded strange.</p><p>But Qin Sang understood the Daoist's words, and the word "independent cultivator" flashed through his mind!</p><p>Independent cultivators in this world?</p><p>Qin Sang had a sudden realization; he might have fallen into a misconception.</p><p>Since he fell into this world, the first cultivator he met was a Daoist Court official.  From Zhong Mao Zhi to here, everything he saw and heard was under the control of the Daoist Court, and everything was orderly.</p><p>With the rampant six-day old energy in this world, cultivation depended on cultivation techniques, even for demon cultivators. Qin Sang had thought there was no room for independent cultivators to survive here.</p><p>The Daoist's words made Qin Sang recall his experiences after entering Ju Shan Zhi, and there had been suspicious points before.</p><p>Crane Cry Mountain was the largest immortal city in Ju Shan Zhi, located in the center of the vortex, but the overt guards were not strict.</p><p>He attempted to leave a spiritual contract with the Daoist Court using a forged identity to receive their summons.</p><p>His forged identity was solely for using the grand teleportation array, and he hadn't put much effort into it. Unexpectedly, he passed the scrutiny with ease; there was virtually no scrutiny at all.</p><p>Qin Sang initially believed the Daoist Court was wary of another major power, the Yin Tian Palace, or that they were prepared to abandon the city at any moment.</p><p>For the Daoist Court, rebuilding a celestial city was a trivial matter.</p><p>Now, it seemed likely that they intentionally relaxed their vigilance, leaving an opening for cultivators outside the Daoist sect.</p><p>What is the strength of the forces outside the Daoist Court? How do they overcome their cultivation challenges?</p><p>Do they also seek Dharma from the Daoist Court?</p><p>If so, obtaining Dharma might not be as difficult as he imagined.</p><p>In a flash of insight, Qin Sang considered many things, nodding and saying, "I truly didn't expect that outside the Daoist sect, there could be such a high-level cultivator like you."</p><p>The Daoist pointed outside, saying, "You must have recently arrived in Ju Shan Zhi. The scenery here is quite different from the Daoist Court. If you stay a while longer, you will see."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; he was focused on preparing for his tribulation crossing, and his departure this time was indeed hasty.</p><p>"I'm just curious, how did you obtain the qualifications to receive Dharma?"</p><p>The Daoist looked at Qin Sang meaningfully, "In Ju Shan Zhi, it's not entirely the Daoist sect's world. There are altars outside the Daoist sect that can bestow Dharma, but at our level, we can only seek it from the Daoist Court. That's our difficulty; obtaining Dharma is extremely hard, otherwise, we'd be stuck at this point. The path of cultivation is difficult at every step, unlike you, a true inheritor of the Daoist sect, whose cultivation naturally leads to receiving Dharma, making your path bright."</p><p>As Qin Sang suspected, cultivators in this world, regardless of Daoist sect origin, must receive Dharma.</p><p>The Daoist unintentionally pointed Qin Sang towards another path.</p><p>But Qin Sang needed Dharma for the Nascent Divinity stage. According to the Daoist, he must petition the Daoist Court, and obtaining the qualifications to receive Dharma was not easy.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, about to ask further, when the Daoist's expression changed. Bowing, he said, "My enemies are using secret techniques to search for me. I must immediately go into seclusion to avoid being found. Please forgive me, friend. In a few years, I should be able to resolve my troubles, and then we can drink together."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly and stopped questioning; he didn't want to get involved in needless conflict.</p><p>Furthermore, the more he asked, the more likely he was to reveal his shortcomings. It was better to return and investigate thoroughly. With the information provided by the Daoist, he could be more targeted and efficient.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang bowed slightly, summoned his escape light, and sped towards the exit of the cave.</p><p>The Daoist, standing on the water's surface, watched Qin Sang leave, then slowly submerged into the water.</p><p>The cave gradually returned to calm, only the gentle sound of flowing water remained.</p><p>Leaving the Star Valley, Qin Sang glanced back once before continuing directly to Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>Reflecting on his hasty battle with the Daoist, he had made significant gains.  The power of the innate wooden man stele did not disappoint him, solidifying his determination to continue studying this technique diligently. Even after his cultivation fully recovered, this technique would significantly enhance his combat ability.</p><p>He encountered no unexpected events along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Crane Cry Mountain safely.</p><p>After entering the city, Qin Sang remained prepared, diligently cultivating while investigating using the information the Daoist provided.</p><p>After several months, he finally had a more complete understanding.</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed one thing: the sects in Ju Shan Zhi outwardly respected the Daoist Court and called themselves Daoist sects, but they were not necessarily Daoist inheritors.</p><p>Although these sects were not Daoist sects, they had some connection with the Daoist Court.  The Daoist Court and Gui Fang Country were locked in fierce opposition, with no faction able to remain neutral. Those who didn't side with the Daoist Court had to join forces with demons and monsters.</p><p>Ju Shan Zhi also had independent cultivators, but they weren't entirely without background.</p><p>Indeed, there were altars outside the Daoist sect that could bestow Dharma, and the conditions were not as stringent as those of the Daoist sect.</p><p>But according to Qin Sang's investigations, these Dharma could only support cultivators up to the Sheng Xuan level, or the Nascent Soul stage, and most were flawed, which the Daoist sect referred to as "external Dharma."</p><p>The Daoist clearly perceived Qin Sang's true cultivation, indirectly confirming his strength.</p><p>After discovering this, Qin Sang attempted to contact a sect named Tao Heng Shan.</p><p>If he were willing to exchange merit, obtaining the qualifications to receive Dharma wouldn't be difficult. However, the more he learned about Dharma, the more hesitant he became.</p><p>Daoist Dharma encompasses everything. The type of Dharma received determines the type of altar one establishes.</p><p>The Dragon Tiger Altar of the three major Daoist sects actually stole techniques from demon Dharma. Physical cultivators don't need to stabilize their vital energy.</p><p>Qin Sang could only cultivate the Military Altar or the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>Comparing the two, he leaned towards the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>Therefore, he needed to combine his existing resources and carefully consider what type of Dharma to cultivate, hoping to establish an altar as soon as possible after receiving Dharma, and choose one that best suited him.</p><p>Dharma below the Nascent Divinity stage wasn't what Qin Sang urgently needed. Even without Dharma, he was rarely rivaled at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The problem was how to obtain Dharma qualifications from the Daoist Court.</p><p>He could only find out after contacting the Daoist Court.  But he could be certain that to gain the Daoist Court's recognition, he had to have a clear origin and withstand scrutiny.</p><p>And that was precisely what Qin Sang lacked.</p><p>Everything seemed to have returned to the starting point, but it wasn't actually the case. Obtaining a status outside the Daoist sect was far easier than infiltrating it.</p><p>After receiving this information, Qin Sang pondered that acquiring disciple status required careful planning.  Time was short; it was better to focus on making a breakthrough in body refinement, which offered better prospects.</p><p>He found a secluded cave dwelling in the Immortal City and dedicated himself to cultivating the "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement" technique.</p><p>Drawing in the primordial qi of the six heavens to temper his body, complementing it with stellar energy and aided by the Dragon Transformation Pool's spiritual liquid, his cultivation speed far surpassed anything he had experienced before.</p><p>If not for the worries of mental distraction, this realm was undoubtedly a paradise for physical cultivators.</p><p>In just five years, Qin Sang felt his progress was astonishing, as if he had undergone a transformation.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang wasn't completely oblivious to the outside world.</p><p>Shi Xuan and others frequently sent him various news, and Qin Sang himself occasionally interacted with different factions, trying to understand this world as much as possible.</p><p>One day,</p><p>a blue light flew into the cave dwelling, manifesting a talisman before Qin Sang. The talisman shattered, and several lines of text appeared in his mind.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang opened his eyes, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>He had left a spiritual contract with the Daoist court; as long as he had a foothold in the Immortal City, he could have the court send a summons.</p><p>Now he understood that the Daoist court issued summons not only to give out benefits but also to appease outside forces.</p><p>Given the unique environment of this realm, if the Daoist court didn't cultivate these forces, it would be tantamount to pushing them towards the Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>Simultaneously, they could delegate those thorny matters to outsiders, achieving two goals at once.</p><p>Of course, the summons wouldn't involve any true secrets.</p><p>The talisman brought news of a newly issued summons from the Daoist court. One item caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>The summons stated that if completed, one could obtain a token from a Dongxuan True Person of the Daoist court.  With this token, one could request the Dongxuan True Person's assistance once.</p><p>It wasn't for combat; this Dongxuan True Person specialized in alchemy and was quite renowned.  The opportunity to have him refine pills was something many people yearned for.</p><p>A Dongxuan True Person was equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>This was the kind of summons Qin Sang had been waiting for. His plan was to use the reward from the summons as leverage to request the Xuanji Gate Master's assistance through the Daoist court.</p><p>Summons that could procure the help of a Nascent Soul cultivator for combat would undoubtedly be extremely dangerous, and this one was just right.</p><p>Requesting the Xuanji Gate Master to cast a spell on him, infusing him with stellar energy, was comparable to asking the alchemist to refine pills.</p><p>Of course, with sufficient merit, he might have a chance to request the Xuanji Gate Master's assistance, but that would mean he would be begging, and he would be helpless if the other party refused.</p><p>Moreover, over the past five years, in order to improve his cultivation quickly, he had exchanged many spiritual herbs from the Daoist court, consuming a significant amount of his merit. Accumulating merit would require him to travel extensively, which would hinder his cultivation.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang needed to prepare Frost-Jade Pills for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, so befriending an alchemist beforehand wouldn't hurt.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer hesitated, immediately leaving his cave dwelling and heading straight for the Daoist court.</p><p>This summons was issued by the North Pole Exorcism Academy.</p><p>Qin Sang hurried over, extending his spiritual sense into the archway. Seeing that the summons hadn't been taken yet, he touched it with his spiritual sense, and a small path immediately appeared before him, leading to a large black hall.</p><p>As he approached the hall, the doors opened automatically.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped inside and saw a person sitting inside, expressionless and awe-inspiring.</p><p>After scanning the person's attire, Qin Sang bowed, "Greetings, Nine Heavens Inspector."</p><p>The Nine Heavens Inspector held a rank of Zheng Wu Pin  in the North Pole Exorcism Academy, one level higher than the capital altar master.</p><p>Judging by his aura, he had reached the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>The Inspector examined Qin Sang, "Daoist friend, are you willing to accept this summons?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "This is my intention, but I have a request."</p><p>"Please state it."</p><p>"If I complete the summons, can I exchange the token to have the senior intervene and request the Xuanji Gate Master to do something for me?"</p><p>The Inspector didn't make things difficult for Qin Sang, pondering, "Daoist friend, please wait a moment. I need to inquire about the senior's willingness." </p>
