<h1></h1><p>The Heavenly Fire returned to its position. The scent of blood, previously burned away, slowly seeped out again from the mangled corpses and Kundao, permeating the entire cave.</p><p>Kundao's hair was dishevelled, her appearance like a crazed demon.</p><p>She sat呆滞ly, her expression contorted, alternating between fear and vacancy. Blood, mixed with saliva, dripped from the corners of her mouth. Her aura, however, was climbing, as if she were absorbing the essence blood and Nascent Soul power of the white-robed Daoist.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Blood splattered on the ground.</p><p>Kundao seemed to be startled by the sound, her body jerking violently. A strange glint appeared in her hollow eyes as she stiffly and slowly turned her neck.</p><p>Indifferent to the remains of her senior brother in front of her, Kundao's gaze fixed on the Crimson Fire Sword beside the fire barrier.</p><p>When the white-robed Daoist perished, the Crimson Fire Sword had almost broken through the Fire Bell. Because the Heavenly Fire had been diverted by Kundao to ambush the Daoist, the sword had been flung away, landing on the ground alongside the Fire Rhinoceros Horn and the spatial ring it had dislodged.</p><p>Kundao crawled over on all fours and grabbed the spiritual sword.</p><p>The Crimson Fire Sword, now masterless, lost its fiery aura, revealing its true form. The blade seemed to be forged from some kind of crystal, similar to the Firefly Bracelet on Kundao's wrist.</p><p>Kundao saw her own reflection in the polished surface of the sword.</p><p>She lifted her bloodied hand and gently touched her face, her fingers tracing her features from forehead to lips to ears, carefully caressing them with a look of novelty in her eyes.</p><p>In the process, she smeared blood everywhere, turning her face into a grotesque mask that obscured her delicate features.</p><p>Suddenly, she froze, staring intently at her reflection.</p><p>An instinct that wasn't hers told her that this wasn't beautiful.</p><p>She tilted her head and drew a wisp of Heavenly Fire from the Fire Bell. It burst forth, flames encircling her, sweeping away the bloodstains. Finding the smell of blood unpleasant, she incinerated the remains and bloodstains, incidentally erasing all traces of the battle.</p><p>The air in the cave cleared.</p><p>Kundao straightened her robes and looked at her reflection again, feeling much more pleased.  Her lips twitched, forming an awkward, strange smile. Finally, she smoothed her lips with her fingers until the smile looked pleasant, practicing several times until she became proficient.</p><p>She grabbed the sword, testing its weight in her hand.  She then summoned the spatial ring and both of their interspatial pouches, using the Heavenly Fire to directly shatter the restrictions on them, scattering their contents across the floor.</p><p>She touched this, looked at that, discarding everything like trash. She ate whatever was edible.  Finally, her gaze landed on the Fire Rhinoceros Horn.</p><p>“Heavenly Tribulation…”</p><p>Kundao's voice was completely different from before. Though she was murmuring to herself, it was sharp and strange, like the strained voice of someone who didn't know how to speak. Her expression was also somewhat hazy.</p><p>After examining the Fire Rhinoceros Horn for a long time, Kundao decided to take it with her.  Holding the Crimson Fire Sword upside down, she propped herself up on her legs and slowly stood up, taking a step forward.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Though the cave floor was flat, Kundao fell straight down, landing hard.</p><p>Face-first.</p><p>“Oof…”</p><p>Kundao propped herself up, her posture awkward.  She giggled, a surprisingly innocent sound.</p><p>She got up again, steadied herself, and started walking again, becoming more coordinated with each step.  Within a few strides, she had completely familiarized herself with her body, walking with large, confident steps.</p><p>Walking out of the cave, Kundao suddenly turned her head towards the west, as if listening intently to something.  A moment later, her body flickered and she vanished into thin air.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two were still in pursuit.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could clearly sense that Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao had become more cautious, no longer as aggressive as before, focusing their efforts on dealing with the Divine Restriction.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang had also encountered a problem.</p><p>The power and difficulty of the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction far exceeded his expectations, giving Qin Sang a deeper understanding of the profound foundation of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>After entering the Divine Restriction and confirming that Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao could only trail behind him, posing no immediate threat, Qin Sang focused on finding a way to break the restriction.</p><p>He tried various secret techniques and treasures, finally returning to the Fire Seed Golden Lotus.</p><p>After careful deduction, Qin Sang discovered that the Divine Restriction seemed to lock onto intruders through the Heavenly Fire's own senses, automatically attacking discordant auras.</p><p>This led him to devise a strategy: control the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to construct a fire cage, and during the collision of flames, capture a portion of the Heavenly Fire's power.</p><p>Within the black fire dragon, the Blazing Sun Heavenly Fire automatically condensed into a ball.</p><p>Qin Sang's hand seals changed rapidly, cooperating with the restriction, forcibly severing the connection between this ball of Blazing Sun Heavenly Fire and the Divine Restriction, then immediately using the Fire Seed Golden Lotus secret technique to refine a trace of the Heavenly Fire.</p><p>The process of refining the Heavenly Fire was unexpectedly smooth.</p><p>The grade of the Blazing Sun Heavenly Fire was lower than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>But things weren't that simple.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the Heavenly Fire he refined and the Blazing Sun Heavenly Fire outside were essentially two different types of spiritual fire, either changed when he captured it, or during the refining process.</p><p>Refining Heavenly Fire to deceive the Divine Restriction wouldn't work!</p><p>Divine Restriction, Divine Restriction, the root cause still lay in the restriction itself. He had only refined the outer appearance of the Heavenly Fire, a mere semblance of the real thing.</p><p>This was troublesome.</p><p>The further in he went, the more terrifying the Heavenly Fire became.  If this continued, the power of the Divine Restriction in the depths would definitely be horrifying, capable of threatening the lives of Grand Cultivators.  Forcing his way through was not feasible.</p><p>Reaching that point, shaking off his pursuers wouldn't be difficult, but getting through the Divine Restriction to reach the Wordless Jade Wall would be.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a better solution for the time being.</p><p>Since the Divine Restriction was essentially masterless, Qin Sang was confident that with his strength and Heavenly Eye Divine Ability, he could definitely get through. The problem was that breaking the restriction required time.</p><p>While ascending the mountain, Qin Sang had noticed spiritual light flickering at the entrance of the Formless Immortal Sect, estimating that the Cloud Dragon's power was waning and cultivators were gradually entering.  This would undoubtedly provide powerful assistance to the Dao sects and the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>More critically, news of the legacy's emergence had inevitably spread, and experts from all sides were on their way.</p><p>By then, all sects would gather at the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>If it were chaotic warfare, it might be alright.</p><p>But the Central Continent was accustomed to order, and it was highly likely that they would first establish a protocol and divide the spoils of the Formless Immortal Sect amongst themselves. Those with unknown origins, like him, would be excluded and become targets.</p><p>How to break this deadlock?</p><p>While Qin Sang pondered, Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao had similar concerns.</p><p>They pursued him for two reasons: to find an opportunity to kill Qin Sang, and to drive Qin Sang deeper into the Divine Restriction to scout the path for them. Neither had forgotten the Wordless Jade Wall; neither wanted to miss the opportunity for Nascent Soul Transformation.</p><p>As they ventured deeper into the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction, the thought of killing Qin Sang faded, replaced by the need to guard against Qin Sang using the Divine Restriction to set traps.</p><p>If they hadn't wanted to keep an eye on Qin Sang and see what methods he would use to get through, they might have already given up the chase.</p><p>Su Zinan knew very well that it was impossible to kill Qin Sang here. Now, he was simply locking onto Qin Sang's movements, concentrating on observing the surrounding Heavenly Fire and pondering a way to break the restriction.</p><p>Judging by Mo Xingdao's expression, he was thinking along the same lines.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Heavenly Fire was attracted ahead, rushing towards them continuously.</p><p>They cooperated tacitly, using a deflecting technique to swiftly weave between the flames, their figures flickering, the fire unable to touch them.</p><p>It looked easy, but both knew that this maneuver had its limits. Unless they found a better method, it wouldn't be enough to traverse the entire Divine Restriction.</p><p>Just then, two balls of Heavenly Fire entered Su Zinan's field of vision.</p><p>Looking past the dazzling flames, Su Zinan noticed another smaller ball of Heavenly Fire.  He found it odd, then suddenly saw the small fire ball rapidly pass through the middle of the larger ones.  Alarm bells went off in his head; something was wrong.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Su Zinan, who had been habitually guiding the trajectory of the Heavenly Fire, immediately stopped and retreated rapidly.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was even more alert, retreating without hesitation.</p><p>The next moment, the small fire ball ripped open from within, a firebird spreading its wings and flying towards them.  Unfortunately, it ultimately collided with a ball of Heavenly Fire.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The firebird and the Heavenly Fire exploded like fireworks, countless streams of fire scattering in all directions.  The residual wave triggered other balls of Heavenly Fire, causing a chain reaction of explosions.</p><p>At the same time, a cold voice echoed in their minds, "If you dare to pursue me further, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao evaded the residual waves and looked at the chaotic scene in front of them, their expressions extremely serious.</p><p>Ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, simultaneously increasing his speed.</p><p>Just now, he had used the refined Heavenly Fire to cloak the firebird, masking its aura. Although the refined Heavenly Fire was only a semblance, from the outside, there was no difference.</p><p>The firebird was an inanimate object and wouldn't trigger a strong reaction from the Divine Restriction.</p><p>This way, he was able to stealthily leave the firebird behind, setting a trap and ambushing them.</p><p>However, the aura of the Southern Bright Flame was too unique; the Heavenly Fire couldn't completely conceal it, and given enough time, it would still attract the Divine Restriction's counterattack. Moreover, the trap could only utilize three firebirds; he couldn't control six yet.</p><p>Once he got close to them, he would definitely be detected, so the trap had its limits.</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully deduced that even if he subdued more Heavenly Fire or used his Demonic Fire, this kind of trap would be difficult to use effectively because they were now extremely cautious.</p><p>If he led them into the depths of the Divine Restriction, Qin Sang himself would be too preoccupied to act, let alone attack.</p><p>Knowing that the trap wouldn't be very effective, Qin Sang still used it.</p><p>Firstly, to force them to retreat, making things easier later.</p><p>Secondly, as a warning, primarily aimed at Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Qin Sang had used the Sun God Tree against Old Wu before.  Su Zinan couldn't have missed it, and he must have known the power of the Southern Bright Flame, but he might not have told Mo Xingdao. Once Mo Xingdao knew he possessed such a devastating weapon, he would become apprehensive and hesitate.</p><p>It would be even better if he could scare him off directly.</p><p>As he expected, as soon as the firebird appeared, they retreated.</p><p>Seeing his pursuers give up, Qin Sang continued inward for a while, then unexpectedly reversed course and flew towards the outside of the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction.</p><p>During the time they had been chasing him, his avatar should have almost passed through the outer fog, he thought. If his true body couldn't get past the Divine Restriction, his avatar had even less chance.</p><p>He planned to meet up with his avatar first.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang had a vague idea.</p><p>He was worried that spending too much time grappling with the Divine Restriction would give Zhu Wudao and the other Formless Immortal Sect remnants an advantage.</p><p>Did Zhu Wudao and the others have another motive for deliberately sabotaging the outer formations?</p><p>Sometimes, taking a step back might reveal a shortcut.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Mo Xingdao narrowed his eyes, staring at the dissipating remnants of the Southern Bright Flame, his gaze grim: “Is this the strongest spiritual fire that fellow wields?”</p><p>His tone implied a question.</p><p>Su Zinan's description of this spiritual fire had been too brief.  Those who heard it only knew that the spiritual fire was strong, but couldn't comprehend its terrifying nature.  This was clearly deliberate on his part.</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>Su Zinan nodded, his expression unchanged.  “Old Wu was forced back by this kind of firebird back then.  In a mere few decades, I hadn't expected him to have improved and become even stronger.”</p><p>Seeing him speak so casually, Mo Xingdao couldn't continue to dwell on this topic and asked what they should do next.</p><p>“It's not wise to pursue that fire fiend any further…  Does Fellow Daoist Mo recall what Old Devil Zhu said when he urged us to shatter the jade pavilion?” Su Zinan thought for a moment and asked Mo Xingdao in return.</p><p>Mo Xingdao answered indirectly, “Old Devil Zhu holds the Gold Phase Token.”</p><p>Su Zinan glanced at him and smiled, “So Fellow Daoist Mo had suspicions early on. The restrictions here follow the rules of the Five Elements' mutual generation. There must be four other elemental Divine Restrictions, comparable in power to the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction. He deliberately destroyed the jade pavilion, so there should be some change in the position of the Metal Divine Restriction!”</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded.  The two of them also started to return, but chose a different direction from Qin Sang, heading towards where they deduced the Metal Divine Restriction to be.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Divine Restriction.</p><p>Below the plaza, the fog churned as a figure emerged from within – Qin Sang's avatar.</p><p>Although the formations within the fog had been damaged, they were still troublesome. Fortunately, there was a connection between him and his true body. By clinging to this thread of connection, he wouldn't lose his way in the fog and quickly found his way out of the chaos.</p><p>The avatar was cautious.  Upon emerging, he immediately slipped into an abandoned dwelling and carefully surveyed the scene above.</p><p>Blocked by the Divine Restriction, his mind couldn't connect with his true body. He didn't understand the environment here, but knew that his true body had already entered, vaguely sensing its location.</p><p>Just then, the avatar's eyes narrowed slightly. He saw a golden cloud of mist in the west, its edges constantly vibrating, accompanied by rumbling thunder.  The commotion and fluctuations were quite intense, clearly indicating a battle between powerful individuals.</p><p>They were fighting as they moved deeper into the golden mist.</p><p>The depths of the golden mist seemed to be affected as well, with light and shadow flickering.</p><p>“Not the location of my true body…”</p><p>The avatar's expression eased slightly.  He continued to observe, confirming that there was no one else on the plaza, and cautiously approached the golden mist, entering the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Just as he entered, the Fire Jade Centipede suddenly awoke.</p><p>After devouring the fire spirit, the Fire Jade Centipede had been drowsy.  The avatar had tucked it into his sleeve, occasionally stimulating it to prevent it from falling into a deep sleep. Now, it suddenly awakened.</p><p>Based on experience, it had sensed something.</p><p>“A treasure within the restriction?”</p><p>The avatar was surprised. He was about to summon the Fire Jade Centipede to see the direction when the centipede's agitated state suddenly intensified, letting out a sharp cry.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>The avatar was startled, immediately realizing something was amiss.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's state indicated that the treasure was nearby and rapidly approaching him.</p><p>This place was permeated with the Five Elements Restriction, seemingly empty.</p><p>But the Fire Jade Centipede's behavior was definitely abnormal!</p><p>Without waiting to find out the reason, the avatar's eyes suddenly turned deathly pale. 'Swish!' The Ice Soul Divine Light was unleashed instantly.</p><p>White icy air surged like a torrential flood, instantly filling the space around the avatar, freezing everything.  This area was at the periphery, and the power of the Five Elements Restriction was limited, unable to withstand the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the divine light swept through empty space!</p><p>The avatar's expression changed.  He felt increasingly uneasy.  Surrounded by the divine light, he decisively retreated from the Five Elements Restriction.</p><p>As he retreated beyond the golden mist, the Fire Jade Centipede's agitation immediately subsided considerably.</p><p>At the same time, in a place beyond the avatar's vision, the golden mist distorted, a graceful figure flickering into existence.</p><p>Half of her body was still within the restriction, invisible.</p><p>But the other half was exposed.</p><p>Kundao frowned and retreated back into the restriction.</p><p>The avatar sensed something and abruptly turned his head, but saw nothing.</p>
