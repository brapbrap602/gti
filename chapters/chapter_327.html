<h1>Chapter 320: Gloom Mountain Pass</h1><p>Gloom Mountain Pass.</p><p>One of the Seven Stronghold Passes, situated between Pure罡 City and Heavenly Abyss Pass.</p><p>This city presents a stark contrast to Skull Pass.</p><p>The great city lies within a boundless swamp. Located in the frigid northern lands, the swamp remains unfrozen, instead bubbling with mud. Bursting bubbles release warm air.</p><p>At the swamp's bottom, a hot spring seems to exist.</p><p>A constant stream of heat, unable to dissipate, shrouds the entire swamp in a dense, dark fog.</p><p>Only by ascending to a great height can one see the sun.</p><p>Despite this harsh environment, vegetation thrives in the swamp, albeit in bizarre, twisted forms.  Especially in the fog, the contorted ancient trees resemble clawing ghouls.</p><p>Gloom Mountain Pass's walls are formed by a row of these peculiar ancient trees. These towering, blue-black trees are so massive that even the smallest requires dozens of people to encircle.</p><p>These tightly packed trees appear lifeless, their texture resembling iron and stone.</p><p>Security at Gloom Mountain Pass is not overly strict.  Qin Sang ascended to the "wall top," paid spirit stones to the guards, received a token, and gained free passage until the token's runes expired.</p><p>Overlooking Gloom Mountain Pass, Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>This city is built in the treetops.</p><p>It's said that many cultivators establish their cave dwellings within the tree hollows of Gloom Mountain Pass, and this proved to be true.</p><p>The current Gloom Mountain Pass bustled with activity, a cacophony of voices creating a sense of prosperity.  The constant flow of cultivators was a rare sight, likely drawn by the auction.</p><p>The cultivators' attire varied greatly, a veritable spectacle of different styles.</p><p>Within Gloom Mountain City, the Nascent Soul Grand City Lord maintains order. Neither righteous nor demonic cultivators dare to cause trouble.  Disputes are settled through duels outside the city.  This enforced harmony creates a strange atmosphere.</p><p>Qin Sang descended onto a net-like ground woven from countless thin branches. Looking down, he saw the churning black mud of the swamp, a nauseating sight, though it lacked any foul odor.</p><p>Furthermore, the underground heat couldn't penetrate Gloom Mountain Pass. It was daytime, the sun shining brightly, illuminating the city.</p><p>He stamped his foot, and the tree net shimmered with faint restrictive light, remarkably stable.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, then merged into the crowd.  After navigating several streets, he stood before a three-story wooden building.</p><p>The building rested on a large tree's fork, supported by only two slender branches. Qin Sang could tell that a suspension formation, not the branches, bore the building's weight; otherwise, the branches would have snapped.</p><p>Seemingly designed to complement the tree's form, the building appeared slightly crooked yet adhered perfectly to the trunk, creating a peculiar harmony.</p><p>Such wooden structures were common in Gloom Mountain Pass. Their three-story height made them appear modest compared to others.</p><p>Spirit Pill Pavilion.</p><p>The name was also understated.</p><p>Yet, this Spirit Pill Pavilion was a branch of the Taiyi Pill Pavilion.</p><p>Shao Hua Mountain also had businesses in Gloom Mountain Pass, but their influence was less than Taiyi Pill Pavilion's.  For information on the auction, Taiyi Pill Pavilion was the best resource, so Qin Sang came directly, armed with Steward Liu's token.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, welcome!"</p><p>Upon presenting the token and his identity, Qin Sang was warmly ushered into a quiet room by the Spirit Pill Pavilion's steward.</p><p>"Our humble shop is nothing to boast about," said Steward Pu, whose cultivation was comparable to Steward Liu's, though he came to Gloom Mountain Pass voluntarily rather than due to age.</p><p>Through Steward Pu, Qin Sang learned that most businesses in Gloom Mountain Pass were controlled by the City Lord.</p><p>Gloom Mountain Pass's City Lord commanded numerous cultivators, maintaining order like an independent power, albeit one without an official sect.</p><p>Taiyi Pill Pavilion didn't dare to challenge the City Lord within Gloom Mountain Pass, maintaining only a single shop catering to Foundation Establishment cultivators and above.  The reputation of Taiyi Pill Sect sufficed; they didn't need a grand storefront.</p><p>Due to this unique business model, Taiyi Pill Pavilion had connections with Gloom Mountain Pass's upper echelons, relying on this influence to gather information.</p><p>Unfortunately, details about the auction were scarce. Even after a year, little new information had surfaced.</p><p>"The auction begins in ten days. I'll arrange a quiet room for you, Fellow Daoist Qin, where you can cultivate undisturbed," Steward Pu offered.</p><p>Qin Sang declined. With only ten days, cultivation wasn't urgent. "To be honest, Steward Pu, I only learned about the Gloom Mountain Pass auction from Old Liu. I know little about it. Could you explain the rules and precautions?"</p><p>"Certainly."</p><p>Steward Pu ordered spirit tea. While they sipped, he began his explanation.</p><p>"The Gloom Mountain Pass auction isn't held in the city but on a stone island a hundred miles north.  A large formation surrounds the island, primarily to ward off Cloud Beasts. It poses no threat to cultivators.  Anyone with Qi Refining tenth level or higher can easily reach the island.</p><p>Fighting is strictly prohibited within the formation's range. All transactions must be consensual.</p><p>Legend says a Core Formation expert, arrogant in his strength, once tried to seize items by force.  The next day, his corpse was found hanging from the central stone pillar, and his sect didn't dare utter a word.</p><p>Besides hosting the auction, the island serves as a trading hub, a miniature marketplace, open only for a month each time.</p><p>This trading event isn't trivial. Even cultivators wanted by major powers frequent it. Yet, both righteous and demonic factions respect the City Lord and refrain from interfering with the trading event, at least openly.</p><p>Combined with the auction's draw, the island attracts numerous cultivators.</p><p>If you're interested, Fellow Daoist Qin, I suggest exploring the island. You might find rare treasures."</p><p>Steward Pu spoke meaningfully.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  The trading event being held outside the city suggested a compromise between the City Lord and the various powers.</p><p>Judging by Steward Pu's tone, the event likely featured illicit goods, unsuitable for the auction and traded discreetly.</p><p>It was worth a look.</p><p>Qin Sang's spoils from Yu Daiyue and the others, combined with his gains from Elder Di Que, amounted to over ten thousand low-grade spirit stones, a considerable sum for a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>A high-quality top-grade magical tool typically cost around three thousand spirit stones through normal channels.</p><p>Unless it was a talisman treasure, thousand-year spirit herb, or Soul-Attracting Grass—priceless treasures—he could afford most things.</p>
