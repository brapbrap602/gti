<h1>Chapter 1176: The Celestial Plateau</h1><p>Ancient scriptures and the life-bound insect gu techniques of the Witch Clan corroborated each other.</p><p>Although Qin Sang hadn't found any information about the Celestial Eye Butterfly, he was no longer as clueless as before. Some ideas had begun to form in his mind, though they would require further verification in the future.</p><p>"Even the Beast Taming Sect doesn't have records of it. From now on, we'll have to rely on each other and slowly find our way," Qin Sang said, turning his head with a gentle gaze toward the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly seemed to sense Qin Sang's thoughts, its soft wings lightly brushing against his cheek as if to comfort him.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Qin Sang returned the ancient texts, bid farewell to the deputy sect master of the Beast Taming Sect, and then headed directly south, arriving at Cangheng Island in the Yuncang Great Marsh.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, following instructions, had been waiting on the island for some time.</p><p>Qin Sang contacted a major merchant guild on the island, asking them to gather the spiritual herbs needed for the Fire Melting Pill formula. Once he decided which major city to station himself in, they would deliver the herbs there.</p><p>The merchant guild was more than willing to serve a demon king, and the prices they offered were very fair.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang purchased some materials. He still had a considerable amount of high-grade demon bones on him, which, combined with Golden Sinking Wood, could be used to forge flying swords.</p><p>Finding the most top-tier spiritual materials was difficult for the time being.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't aiming too high. For now, crafting a mid-grade spiritual sword would suffice, and he could think about upgrading it later.</p><p>After staying for a day to handle various trivial matters, Qin Sang and Tan Yi'en set off, crossing the Yuncang Great Marsh and arriving at its southern shore.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's first step into the Celestial Alliance!</p><p>With a flash, his figure landed on a mountain by the shore, and he gazed southward.</p><p>The Yuncang Great Marsh, extending westward to the Yuncang River, formed a natural barrier between the Minor Cold Domain and the Celestial Alliance.</p><p>It was said that in the past, the two regions were inseparable. But at some point, due to unknown reasons, a rift formed between them, and the conflict deepened to the point of armed confrontation.</p><p>The name "Celestial Alliance" was derived from the Celestial Plateau.</p><p>South of the Yuncang Great Marsh, the terrain rose rapidly, forming a vast plateau region known as the Celestial Plateau. Its area was as large as the Minor Cold Domain and the Heavenly Demon Hills combined.</p><p>Records indicated that the summit of the Celestial Plateau was also the highest point in the entire North Star Realm.</p><p>Compared to the Minor Cold Domain, the Celestial Plateau, though rugged and complex in terrain, had a more monotonous landscape, dominated by snowy plateaus. The mortal world here was also quite different from that of the Minor Cold Domain.</p><p>Because the Minor Cold Domain lay between the Celestial Plateau and the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the northern route for Celestial Alliance cultivators was cut off. While high-level cultivators could still traverse the area, low-level cultivators faced significant difficulties entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>To the south of the Celestial Plateau stretched an endless expanse of desert, sharing the same name as the North Star Realmâ€”the North Star Great Desert.</p><p>From this name alone, it was clear that the desert was the dominant feature of the North Star Realm, covering more than 80% of its territory.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard from Senior Sister Qingjun that among the four islands of the North Star Realm, the North Star Island was not the smallest in area, but its overall strength in the cultivation world was the weakest, precisely because of this.</p><p>The barren desert, with its sparse spiritual energy and scarce resources, was not only unsuitable for mortal life but also made it difficult for cultivators to find suitable abodes for cultivation.</p><p>In the vast desert, life was scarce, and settlements were few and far between.</p><p>There were oases scattered throughout the desert, hosting various small and large factions, but none of them were significant.</p><p>In the North Star Realm, the North Star Great Desert was the most expansive, but the majority of cultivators were concentrated in the Minor Cold Domain, the Celestial Alliance, and the Sin Abyss. These three major powers could be considered holy lands in the eyes of desert cultivators, with the Minor Cold Domain, adjacent to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, being particularly favored.</p><p>The Sin Abyss was located to the southeast of the Celestial Alliance, separated by a stretch of grassland that served as a buffer zone between the two powers. It was said that this grassland was gradually being eroded by the desert.</p><p>Now, the once-buffering grassland had already fallen under the control of the Sin Abyss.</p><p>The southern side of the Celestial Plateau was relatively gentler in terrain compared to the north, though the decrease in elevation was uneven, often flat for a stretch before abruptly dropping off into a cliff.</p><p>The two largest drops were known as the two great southern steps of the Celestial Plateau.</p><p>The Celestial Alliance, holding the high ground, had suffered consecutive defeats in the last war.</p><p>The first step's stronghold had already been lost to the Sin Abyss, which was now steadily advancing on the first step. Once the final barrier was breached, the Celestial Plateau would be left defenseless.</p><p>The Celestial Alliance was a coalition of various forces on the Celestial Plateau, united to resist enemies from both front and rear, currently led by the old Taoist Zhenyi.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Phoenix Wings, enveloping Tan Yi'en in his true essence as they soared high, finally reaching the summit of the Celestial Plateau, where the central city of the Celestial Alliance was located.</p><p>This was the highest peak Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>Night had just fallen.</p><p>The sky was cloudless, crystal clear.</p><p>Countless stars twinkled, forming a Milky Way that seemed within arm's reach.</p><p>But even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he dared not venture into the high-altitude wind zones.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the vast, deep sky, recalling the bold words he had once spoken to Princess Dongyang. After forming his Nascent Soul, he had passed through the Great Sui Dynasty and improved the restrictions on the princess's tomb.</p><p>Now, he stood as one of the pinnacle figures of this world.</p><p>Yet, the higher his cultivation, the more he realized how insignificant he truly was.</p><p>Nascent Soul, Spirit Transformation, Void Refinement, Unity, and Great Ascension, followed by transcending tribulations to ascend as an immortal.</p><p>In the present world, late Nascent Soul was the peak, and Spirit Transformation cultivators existed only in legends, let alone higher realms.</p><p>Where did the path ahead lie?</p><p>If the storm zone was a cage, could the path be outside the cage?</p><p>"Thinking too much," Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly. Every bottleneck from now on would require his own efforts to break through, and whether he could advance beyond late Nascent Soul was still unknown.</p><p>Finally, the outline of Celestial City came into view.</p><p>Though it paled in comparison to Tianxing City in the Canglang Sea, it was still the foremost city in this region.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his aura. With a flap of his wings, he flew straight toward one of the city gates.</p><p>The guards at the gate noticed Qin Sang's approach, and a Core Formation cultivator hurried out, bowing respectfully, "Esteemed Senior, are you the Moonlight Demon King?"</p><p>They had clearly received news of the demon king's reinforcements and easily recognized Qin Sang.</p><p>"Indeed, it is I."</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his wings, landing before the man and setting Tan Yi'en down.</p><p>"Elder Ji is waiting inside the city for the demon king seniors. Please follow me, Senior..."</p><p>"Wait here for me."</p><p>Qin Sang issued the order and followed the cultivator into the city. Moments later, they arrived at a palace, clearly a core area of the city, where he met Elder Ji of the Celestial Alliance.</p><p>"Just as Brother Snake King mentioned you, here you are, Brother Moonlight."</p><p>Elder Ji, dressed in Taoist robes, had a thin face and appeared to be in his forties. He was exceptionally warm toward Qin Sang.</p><p>"Brother Snake King spoke highly of you just now. It's only now that I've learned the Heavenly Demon Hills have produced another young talent! With Brother Moonlight guarding it, the Threefold Pass will surely be impregnable."</p><p>"You flatter me, Brother Ji. Brother Snake King must have exaggerated quite a bit."</p><p>Qin Sang clasped his hands in return. "So, you've already decided to have me stationed at the Threefold Pass?"</p><p>******</p>
