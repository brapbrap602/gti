Chapter 485: The Transaction


“Please have a look, Daoist friend!”


Manager Bao sat down opposite Qin Sang, producing a jade box from somewhere and placing it before Qin Sang.


He opened the jade box.


An extremely strong demonic aura surged upwards. Inside the jade box was a demon pill!


The oppressive aura of a great demon at the Demon Pill stage still lingered on the demon pill.  Qin Sang and Manager Bao were close enough to be affected, their breathing becoming heavier.


The demon pill was about the size of a baby’s fist, completely captivating Qin Sang’s attention.


He leaned forward slightly, his eyes wide as he observed.  Although the demon pill glowed brilliantly, the luster seemed somewhat dim, clearly indicating a loss of vitality – it had obviously been removed for many years.


If it were a freshly extracted demon pill, Manager Bao wouldn't dare offer it in exchange, would he?


Due to the restrictive seal on the jade box, it was difficult to see clearly.


Qin Sang reached out to take the demon pill, but Manager Bao stopped him.


“Whoa!”


Manager Bao gently pressed down on the jade box, his eyes glancing at the restrictions in the quiet room, reminding Qin Sang not to act rashly.  “Daoist friend, I’ve shown my sincerity. Shouldn’t you…”


Qin Sang withdrew his hand, nodded slightly, and said in a deep voice, “My apologies, Manager Bao. Please observe.”


He opened the corpse puppet bag.


The living corpse created by Huang Jiaren flew out.


After a living corpse is created, it retains one spell from its previous life. Huang Jiaren's was a combat technique and movement style, well-suited for corpses with low intelligence.


Yu Hua's legacy was a decent sword technique, but less practical compared to Huang Jiaren's.


Still, Qin Sang decided to keep Yu Hua.


Yu Hua's identity was connected to the Kui Yin Sect and the Yuan Zhao Sect; being left outside might attract trouble.  Huang Jiaren was from the Tian Xing League, eliminating such worries.


The moment Huang Jiaren appeared, Manager Bao’s eyes widened.


His obese body moved with surprising agility; he instantly lunged toward Huang Jiaren, his gaze filled with affection, as if looking at a lover, examining every inch of the corpse, leaving no detail unnoticed.


“A living corpse! It truly is a living corpse!  Full of spirit! You haven't deceived me! Such exquisite necromancy!”


Manager Bao exclaimed repeatedly. Finally, he focused his spiritual sense on Huang Jiaren’s energy sea, and after a moment, let out a much louder exclamation. “False Core stage! It’s truly at the False Core stage!”


Manager Bao suddenly turned, staring at Qin Sang, whose body was hidden by a black robe, his eyes revealing deep apprehension and a hint of awe.


Qin Sang calmly endured Manager Bao’s gaze.  Once the examination was complete, he immediately said, “This individual isn’t from Xiaohan Region, Manager Bao. You needn’t worry about his identity causing you trouble.  You’ve personally examined him. Can we now continue our discussion?”


Qin Sang had underestimated him.


As soon as the business discussion began, the fervor on Manager Bao’s face receded like a tide, his composure instantly restored. He sat back down. “My strength is limited; I’m not afraid of trouble, but…if I’m not mistaken, this type of living corpse shouldn’t be able to improve further, right? There’s no hope of it transforming into a Flying Night Rakshasa.”


Qin Sang snorted.


“Manager Bao, are you joking? If it could transform into a Flying Night Rakshasa, I would keep it myself! Why would I offer it now in exchange for a mere demon pill?


Even if, as legends say, there are self-cultivating corpse puppets reaching the False Core stage, transforming into a Flying Night Rakshasa would require an incredible amount of time.


Besides, do you have the strength to subdue one?


We’re discussing business. If you use unfounded reasons to belittle the living corpse I painstakingly crafted, I won’t agree!”


Qin Sang slammed the table in anger.


Manager Bao remained calm, shaking his head. “You can’t deny that what I said is true.  As you said, compared to a self-cultivating corpse puppet that’s reached the False Core stage, your living corpse seems slightly inferior.”


Self-cultivating top-tier corpse puppets, their bodies tempered by Yin energy, become as hard as refined iron, incredibly fast, and only a step away from becoming a Flying Night Rakshasa. Their power is terrifying, not something even False Core cultivators would easily provoke.


The living corpse was indeed somewhat inferior.


“Have a look at this, and then tell me what you think?”


Qin Sang didn't argue, directly urging Huang Jiaren to use his movement style, along with the protective spell Qin Sang had imbued into him. “A demon pill is just an inanimate object.”


"These living corpses are second only to False Core cultivators in power.  Such a powerful asset, whether for self-defense or to pass down to future generations, is something others would eagerly seek. Isn't it worth a demon core?"

"Incantations!"

Manager Bao was clearly shocked again, but he quickly added, "But they aren't top-tier incantations; their power is limited. They can only be used as a surprise tactic, better than nothing."

Qin Sang almost laughed at this man.

Manager Bao looked at Qin Sang with sincerity, earnestly pleading, "Friend Daoist, you're exchanging for a demon core!  You don't know how much it cost me to obtain this demon core! I've practically gone bankrupt!  Even ignoring Core Formation stage seniors, if I were to take it to the Taiyi Pill Sect, the spiritual pills I could exchange for would be worth no less than the corpse refinement techniques. Of course, if Daoist Friend is willing to exchange the corpse refinement techniques, I will agree immediately..."

Seeing Manager Bao's stubbornness,  Qin Sang, realizing the man was set on obtaining the demon core, decided not to haggle further. He summoned a Foundation Establishment late-stage ghoul.

"I'll add another ghoul."

Manager Bao firmly stated, "Two!"

Qin Sang thought for a moment, took out a jade slip, and wrote down a list of spiritual materials. "And these."

After reviewing the list, Manager Bao hesitated before saying, "Deal!"

...

Yun Cang Marsh.

After the transaction, Qin Sang immediately left the True Water Illusory Array and returned to the Earth-Sinking Cave.

Arriving at a secluded spot, Qin Sang opened the jade box and carefully examined the newly acquired demon core.

One False Core living corpse, plus two ghouls, in exchange for one demon core.

Whether it was a good deal or not was difficult to determine.

Most transactions in the cultivation world are like this; treasures don't have fixed values. For Qin Sang, the demon core was urgently needed, and he was willing to pay any price to obtain it.

This hard-earned demon core, don't fail me now.

Qin Sang let out a long sigh and sped back to the Earth-Sinking Cave.

Yu Hua, pale-faced, stood with his hands bound before Qin Sang.

Qin Sang, however, sat cross-legged, his hand resting on Yu Hua's dantian, his eyes closed. He had remained motionless for three consecutive days, meticulously reviewing the secret technique to enhance him into a Flying Night Rakshasa.

The secret technique was too complex.  There was only one chance, and he had to be extremely cautious.  Qin Sang hesitated to proceed.

He had mentally reviewed the technique countless times, simulating it with Yu Hua's condition countless times. Every problem discovered required a significant amount of time and energy to devise a solution; he was meticulously preparing for any contingency.

On the fourth evening, Qin Sang awoke.

He hadn't done anything, yet his face was filled with exhaustion.

After a night of meditation, Qin Sang finally opened the jade box and took out the demon core.
