<h1>Chapter 1147: The Phoenix Butterfly</h1><p>"Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly was actually undergoing a tribulation. Could it be advancing to its fourth transformation?</p><p>Generally, when spirit insects undergo metamorphosis, they require a long period of dormancy. During its previous two advancements, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had been no exception, transforming into a cocoon.</p><p>Back on Red Leaf Island in the Demon Sea, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had absorbed the power of thunder, mutating to gain the ability to control lightning. It had also slept for a long time to digest that power.</p><p>This time, however, there was no intermediate period of dormancy. After forming the cocoon, it immediately broke free and then attracted a heavenly tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that this was related to the power of the Azure Phoenix it had absorbed. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's transformation was likely not just a simple metamorphosis. He had no idea what kind of changes were taking place.</p><p>"What does a spirit insect's heavenly tribulation look like?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the tribulation clouds, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly was undergoing the tribulation in haste. He hoped nothing would go wrong.</p><p>He had originally planned to wait until he had formed his Nascent Soul before venturing out to seek opportunities to help the Heavenly Eye Butterfly advance. He never expected the butterfly to break through before him. Completely unfamiliar with the tribulations of spirit insects, Qin Sang was at a loss for what to do.</p><p>When cultivators undergo tribulations, they first face the Three Calamities and then the Inner Demon Tribulation.</p><p>For spirit insects, advancement directly attracts a thunder tribulation. There was no telling if there would be further changes afterward.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly was his life-bound spirit insect, connected to him by blood. He wondered if he could help it withstand the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts churned, hesitating. He feared that rashly intervening might cause the tribulation to mutate. The failure of Wandering Cloud during his tribulation had left a shadow on Qin Sang's heart. Facing a heavenly tribulation, he dared not take it lightly.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A fissure tore open.</p><p>A dense azure light burst forth.</p><p>*Sizzle!*</p><p>The light cocoon was completely torn apart. Within the azure light, a butterfly with folded wings appeared, its posture languid, slowly spreading its wings before Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's current appearance, Qin Sang was momentarily stunned, his heart filled with astonishment.</p><p>If not for the clear sense of bloodline connection and the familiar feeling of closeness, he would have doubted whether this butterfly was his Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had undergone a drastic transformation!</p><p>During its third transformation, even though it had gained the ability to control lightning, its appearance had not changed much. Only the patterns of its heavenly eyes had become more vivid, while its body remained as light and fragile as an ordinary butterfly.</p><p>After this metamorphosis, apart from the heavenly eyes on its wings, there was almost no trace of its former self. Even the patterns of the heavenly eyes had changed dramatically!</p><p>Its size had increased many times over, with its wingspan now exceeding a foot in width.</p><p>Even more astonishing was that its wings were no longer the thin, delicate form of a butterfly's wings. Instead, they resembled the wings of an Azure Phoenix, transforming it into a true Phoenix Butterfly!</p><p>The patterns on its azure wings formed a series of phoenix feather-like designs, tightly interwoven, with a flowing halo that could easily be mistaken for the real thing.</p><p>The only difference was that at the center of its wings, the heavenly eye patterns still existed, now elongated, with lightning flickering in their pupils, making them appear more lifelike and spirited.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly circled around Qin Sang, conveying feelings of joy and affection.</p><p>Its phoenix wings fluttered, its tail slender and long, trailing naturally as it flew, resembling the tail feathers of an Azure Phoenix.</p><p>The tip of its tail curled slightly, shimmering with azure light, flowing in the night sky and scattering specks of light.</p><p>This scene was breathtakingly beautiful, unparalleled in its splendor!</p><p>"So beautiful!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, almost failing to recognize his life-bound spirit insect. Such a drastic change could not be explained by a simple metamorphosis. It was likely that both metamorphosis and mutation were occurring simultaneously.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The tribulation clouds roared with immense power.</p><p>In the distance, Demon King Qianji suddenly halted his pursuit, gazing at the direction of the tribulation clouds with a grim expression.</p><p>After a while, the Snake Demon Consort and other great demons caught up, landing beside the demon king, panting heavily. "My lord, why have you stopped?"</p><p>Demon King Qianji snorted coldly, "If I go over now and trigger a mutation in the tribulation, wouldn't I be taking on his calamity?"</p><p>"That's… a tribulation cloud?"</p><p>The demon consort exclaimed, only now noticing the abnormality in the dark clouds.</p><p>The aura of the tribulation lightning was completely different from ordinary thunder. As the daughter of a demon king and the wife of Demon King Qianji, she naturally knew these secrets.</p><p>"Daring to undergo a tribulation in front of me!"</p><p>Demon King Qianji's face showed anger as he roared, "Even if he manages to survive the tribulation, that thief will surely be severely weakened and vulnerable… What a foolhardy creature!"</p><p>"My lord, have you identified the thief? He was able to infiltrate the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss without a sound. His escape techniques and swordsmanship are extraordinary. He must be someone of renown."</p><p>The demon consort also dared not act rashly. Even from this distance, the aura of the tribulation made her tremble, her eyes flashing with fear and a hint of envy.</p><p>She was only at the mid-stage of her demon core, far from achieving human form.</p><p>Demon King Qianji furrowed his brow, "I originally thought it was a young demon with Azure Phoenix bloodline, but after this chase, I'm not so sure. Among the Nascent Soul ancestors of the two realms, those who have comprehended sword intent are few and far between. If this lad is only now undergoing a tribulation, could he be a prodigy among humans?"</p><p>"My lord, why trouble yourself? Whether he's a cultivator or a demon, we'll know once we see the tribulation lightning."</p><p>The demon consort stared at the tribulation clouds.</p><p>There were differences between the tribulation lightning of humans and demons.</p><p>Suddenly, Demon King Qianji let out a light exclamation.</p><p>He had felt that something was off earlier, and now, reminded by the demon consort, he finally realized what it was.</p><p>"Why is the first strike already a thunder tribulation?"</p><p>Demon King Qianji's expression changed slightly as he stared intently at the direction of the tribulation clouds, his demeanor growing more serious. "No! The aura of the tribulation clouds is very abnormal!"</p><p>The demon consort was startled, "Why?"</p><p>"The tribulation clouds have formed, but their power is much weaker than when I underwent my tribulation!"</p><p>Before his words faded, the tribulation clouds underwent another mutation, suddenly converging madly toward the center. The clouds contracted, condensing into a single mass, with lightning streaking through them.</p><p>In an instant, all the accumulated power of the tribulation lightning within the clouds was unleashed!</p><p>The entire sky of tribulation clouds released only this single bolt of lightning before dispersing.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A deafening thunderclap.</p><p>The earth shook and the mountains trembled.</p><p>A streak of silver-white lightning descended from the sky, striking a mountain peak.</p><p>In that moment, the night sky lit up as if it were day, and the air was filled with an aura of destruction.</p><p>Within the mountain range, all living creatures were terrified, trembling and fleeing in panic.</p><p>"Silver tribulation lightning!"</p><p>Seeing this, both the demon king and his consort exclaimed in unison, exchanging glances filled with disbelief.</p><p>"Silver tribulation lightning, silver tribulation lightning…"</p><p>The demon king frowned deeply, trying to recall something. After a moment, his eyes widened with profound shock.</p><p>"Silver tribulation lightning! A spirit insect! A spirit insect is undergoing a tribulation! There's a spirit insect advancing to its fourth transformation over there!"</p><p>"A fourth transformation spirit insect, so that's it…"</p><p>The demon consort was in a daze.</p><p>In the current world of cultivation, a fourth transformation spirit insect was an even rarer existence than a shape-shifting great demon or a Nascent Soul ancestor. The demon race, with its incomplete bloodlines and fragmented heritage, found cultivation more difficult than humans. But compared to spirit insects, they were considered fortunate.</p><p>Spirit insects faced extreme difficulty in cultivation. The power of their heavenly tribulations was said to be less fearsome, and their lightning was silver in color.</p>
