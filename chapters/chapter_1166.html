<h1>Chapter 1158: A Visit</h1><p>Chapter 1158: A Visit</p><p>"Fire Seed Golden Lotus" is a fire-control secret technique.</p><p>Old Man Mu used this method to subdue the Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>After Qin Sang obtained it, he hastily refined a wisp of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, but soon discovered that his cultivation was insufficient to continue practicing this technique.</p><p>According to the secret technique's description, during cultivation, the refined fire seed will undergo transformations like a real lotus, from seed to blossom to full bloom.  "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" is named for this process.</p><p>Once the secret technique is mastered, there are further mystical changes, though the technique doesn't specify them, only mentioning that it depends on the cultivator's luck and chance.</p><p>For Qin Sang, these are still distant prospects.</p><p>Simultaneously with the breakthrough in "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," the cultivator's spiritual sense will also be greatly enhanced—this is the most precious aspect of this technique.</p><p>Back then, Old Man Mu hadn't completed the first stage, the fire seed was still in its seed form, yet his spiritual sense was already comparable to a Grand Cultivator's.</p><p>Qin Sang only refined a rudimentary seed form, barely considered entry-level; he hasn't felt this effect yet.</p><p>"The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire in the demon banners is more than enough to help me break through the first stage. The demon fire is certainly sufficient; it's just a matter of control.  The eighteen demon banners are precious, but this technique enhances oneself; even if all the banners are destroyed, it would be worthwhile."</p><p>Qin Sang was clear about his priorities.</p><p>Besides, the refined demon fire could also be used against enemies.</p><p>He picked up a demon banner, infused it with True Essence, and activated the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire within.</p><p>Soon, he stopped cultivating, his brows furrowed as he stared at the demon fire emanating from the banner.</p><p>His attempt to cultivate the technique again yielded unexpected results.</p><p>His cultivation had greatly increased, his spiritual sense far surpassing that of a Core Formation cultivator.  Furthermore, his soul had been nurtured by the Soul-Nurturing Wood for decades, resulting in a steadily refined spiritual sense showing some results.</p><p>But when he tried to cultivate "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" again, he still found it extremely difficult. Forcibly refining the demon fire nearly caused the fire seed to lose control, with the demon fire striking back.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Qin Sang immediately understood.</p><p>The problem wasn't with him, but with the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire itself!</p><p>It was likely that the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's rank was too high, exceeding the scope of his current realm.  Even at the early Nascent Soul stage, he couldn't control this fire. His previous forced refinement of the rudimentary fire seed was due to the Jade Buddha. After all, the demon fire's main body was sealed within the banners, only a portion of its power was manifested.</p><p>The South Bright 離火 (Li Huo) wouldn't be inferior to the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time.</p><p>Currently, there were only two options.</p><p>The first was to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Trying to strengthen his spiritual sense might also help, but it would be much slower, the return not commensurate with the effort.</p><p>The second was to find another, weaker spiritual fire, like the Winter Nether Cold Flame, as Old Man Mu had done, and first master the first stage of the technique.  Once the fire seed was sufficiently stable and powerful, he could forcibly refine the demon fire.</p><p>Neither of these options was easy.</p><p>One of his purposes in cultivating "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" was to control more demon banners and rapidly improve his combat abilities.</p><p>If it were that easy to break through, why go through all this trouble?</p><p>As for the spiritual fire, its power couldn't be too strong nor too weak.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's knowledge, there were two well-known places with spiritual fires in the Lesser Cold Region.</p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Fire of the Green Sun Demon Sect and the earth fire brewing within the Mountain-within-a-Mountain of the Void Spirit Sect.</p><p>Both of these spiritual fires were already claimed.</p><p>Mountain-within-a-Mountain was the foundation of the Void Spirit Sect.</p><p>This mountain floated in the center of an underground fiery vein, unconnected to the heavens or the earth, perpetually roasted by the underground vein.  Over time, the mountain's stones changed, giving birth to a peculiar earth fire far exceeding ordinary earth fires in power.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had heard that the Mountain-within-a-Mountain and the earth fire were one and the same, the earth fire couldn't be obtained separately.</p><p>And the Void Spirit Sect wouldn't agree.</p><p>"The Ancestral Sacred Fire…"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his infiltration of the Green Sun Demon Sect to steal the Green Sun Divine Gang.</p><p>He remembered the phantom of the Ancestral Sacred Fire atop Divine Gang Peak, like a raging fire god, incredibly ferocious, leaving a deep impression on Qin Sang.</p><p>It was said that the Ancestral Sacred Fire was left behind by the Green Sun Demon Sect's founder, similar in origin to the Winter Nether Cold Flame—spiritual fires cultivated by Nascent Soul ancestors.</p><p>However, the Ancestral Sacred Fire was sealed atop Divine Gang Peak, absorbing an unknown amount of Green Sun Divine Gang over the years, no longer the same spiritual fire as the Green Sun Demon Sect's founder.</p><p>The aura it revealed back then was no weaker than the Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>When the Green Sun Demon Sect declined, they once threatened to detonate the Ancestral Sacred Fire to repel those coveting the sect at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Back then, the Ancestral Sacred Fire was nearing loss of control, the Green Sun Demon Sect was terrified while absorbing the Green Sun Divine Gang."</p><p>"I can absorb and refine the overflowing power of the Ancestral Sacred Fire outside the seal," Qin Sang said, his eyes flashing.  "I wonder if the new sect leader has a way to solve the Ancestral Sacred Fire problem... If it weren't for a Yuan Ying cultivator appearing in the Qingyang Demon Sect, I'd go there and make a request.  I'm sure they wouldn't refuse."</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang decided to postpone his visit. He didn't know this new sect leader. The Qingyang Demon Sect was a demonic sect; they weren't on the same side, and a sudden visit would be inappropriate. He'd investigate the Qingyang Demon Sect first. If they couldn't handle the Ancestral Sacred Fire problem, he wouldn't mind lending a hand.</p><p>"During this period of calm, I might as well go to the demonic lands to investigate, and also check on the Mo Yan Sect and Mei Gu.  I should also visit the Yuanzhao Sect and retrieve the remaining banners..."</p><p>Qin Sang made a plan but didn't rush to leave. He thought about the transparent lotus seeds used for cultivation and wondered if he'd misjudged them before.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the fire seed and, following the steps of the secret technique, integrated the demonic fire into a transparent lotus seed. The process went smoothly; the seed disappeared, and the fire seed reformed.</p><p>He continued to refine the demonic fire, noticing a slight improvement, but that was all. Even at his limit, he couldn't control fifteen demonic banners.</p><p>So Qin Sang gave up and stopped wasting time. He focused on cultivation, spending half his time studying the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* and the other half on body refinement, steadily improving in both.</p><p>A month later, Qin Sang left Bai at the Yuan Shen Sect and departed alone.</p><p>Passing through Da Sui, Qin Sang met with Li Yu Fu and two others, gave them some guidance, then continued north towards the Yuanzhao Sect for a visit.</p><p>He'd already investigated.  The former leader of the Wuji Sect had betrayed the Xiao Han region, nearly leading to the annihilation of both regions. After leaving the Ziwei Palace, the anger of the powerful cultivators was understandable; they ruthlessly divided the Wuji Sect among themselves.</p><p>The Wuji Sect was completely destroyed, and sects affiliated with them suffered varying degrees of repercussions.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect was one of them.</p><p>Fortunately, they hadn't participated in the conspiracy, and by paying a price, they managed to survive without being annihilated.  Over the years, the Yuanzhao Sect had slightly recovered, but it was still not as powerful as it was when Qin Sang was undercover.</p><p>Now, the Yuanzhao Sect's mountain gate was located at the old site of the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang was essentially revisiting an old place.</p>
