<h1>Chapter 415: Skygloom Pass</h1><p>Skygloom Pass.</p><p>One of the two major passes controlled by the demonic sects, it was not far from Shadow Mountain Pass, and the terrain was somewhat similar. The difference was that Skygloom Pass's citadel was built on an island in a swamp, not in ancient trees.</p><p>Skygloom Pass was a gathering place for countless cultivators, especially now, given the current circumstances. Many cultivators dared not leave the pass, so naturally, there was no shortage of auctions, large and small.</p><p>In the southeast corner of Skygloom Pass, within a large courtyard with its gates wide open, two masked figures stood guard on either side.  Figures in black robes frequently entered the courtyard.</p><p>Strangely, they did not enter the rooms beyond the courtyard but instead walked towards an octagonal pavilion in the center.</p><p>The moment they stepped into the pavilion, the figures vanished.</p><p>A cultivator with high enough cultivation could catch a glimpse of thin, silver threads flashing within the pavilion in that instant. This was the fluctuation of a restrictive formation, revealing that the pavilion held a hidden realm.</p><p>As the night deepened, fewer people entered the courtyard.</p><p>Just as the two guards were about to close the gates, a figure hurried towards the courtyard.</p><p>The newcomer wore a concealing black robe, a magical artifact that could shield divine sense. It was impossible to discern whether the person was male or female with the naked eye, nor could their cultivation level be sensed.</p><p>The two guards exchanged glances, and one of them stepped forward, raising a hand to stop the newcomer. "Fellow Daoist, please wait!"</p><p>The newcomer stopped, looked around, and asked in a puzzled voice, "Isn't the auction today?"</p><p>The guard coughed lightly and explained, "The auction is indeed today... However, fellow Daoist, by order of our master, guests attending the auction require qualification verification.  Do you have a token?"</p><p>"Token?"</p><p>The newcomer said with displeasure, "I have long heard of the auctions hosted by Mr. Kan and admired his great name. I have never heard that a token is required for the auction! Did all those people who entered before have tokens? Are you making things difficult for me?"</p><p>The guard waved his hands and explained repeatedly.</p><p>"Certainly not, certainly not...</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please don't misunderstand. We ask this because our master has indeed issued tokens. Every person who holds a token is an honored guest of our establishment...</p><p>"Of course, you can participate in the auction without a token, but with our master's growing reputation, more and more fellow Daoists are coming to participate.</p><p>"Our master is flattered, but unfortunately, limited by space, we are unable to accommodate all fellow Daoists.  Especially for this auction, the matters are of great importance, and all the items are precious treasures. Many elusive seniors have also been attracted.</p><p>"Out of necessity, our master had to set a rule requiring fellow Daoists participating in the auction to present one thousand low-grade spirit stones or have a cultivation level beyond the tenth level of Qi Refinement.</p><p>"Of course, the treasures at the auction will certainly not disappoint you, fellow Daoist. Please understand."</p><p>After hearing the explanation, the newcomer's tone softened. They hummed in acknowledgement and released their cultivation, asking softly, "Is this enough?"</p><p>"Late Foundation Establishment!"</p><p>The guards' expressions changed slightly, and they both bowed deeply, their voices becoming incredibly respectful.  "Senior's presence brings honor to our humble establishment!  Senior automatically qualifies for VIP status. Please follow me to the VIP box. If you have any other needs, our establishment will do its best to fulfill them."</p><p>"No need!"</p><p>The newcomer waved a hand.  "I'm used to sitting in the main hall to watch the excitement.  Hiding in a box by myself is no fun.  Just take me to the main hall. I heard the auction starts at midnight, and the time is almost here. Don't delay my important business."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The guards looked at each other speechlessly. One of them could only lead the way, guiding the newcomer into the pavilion.</p><p>Stepping into the pavilion, the scene before them suddenly changed, and they appeared in an exquisitely decorated hall.</p><p>The hall was divided into three levels. The first level consisted of rows of seats, currently filled with the clamor of cultivators, the majority of whom had at least the tenth level of Qi Refinement.</p><p>The second and third levels were very quiet, consisting of individual boxes.  Each box was concealed by a swirling gray mist. Looking up from the main hall, one could only see a chaotic haze, unable to see who sat inside.</p><p>This mist was one of the effects of the spirit array in the hall.</p><p>In addition, on the walls surrounding the hall, sharp, golden light flickered, exuding a chilling aura, a constant warning to those attending the auction.</p><p>The guard was about to lead the newcomer to a seat up front, but the newcomer glanced around, waved to the guard, and directly sat down in an inconspicuous corner at the very back.</p><p>"Go on. Tell your Mr. Kan that there's no need to give me preferential treatment. As long as the auction satisfies me, I will naturally come again. There's no need for any tokens."</p><p>The guard had no choice but to attribute this to the senior's eccentricity and retreated.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the newcomer's chosen seat offered a panoramic view of the entire auction hall.</p><p>They sat there quietly, not interacting with anyone, exuding a "do not disturb" aura.  Their gaze swept inconspicuously across each cultivator in the hall, as if searching for something.</p><p>Finally, they leaned back in their chair, closed their eyes, and patiently awaited the start of the auction.</p><p>Midnight arrived.</p><p>The auction began.</p><p>Mr. Kan was a refined-looking middle-aged man whose words were as gentle as a spring breeze. It was no wonder, people thought, that he had such a reputation in Skygloom Pass.</p><p>Mr. Kan conducted the proceedings skillfully, briefly addressing the formalities before directly announcing the start of the auction.</p><p>One after another, precious treasures were auctioned off like flowing water.</p><p>Under Mr. Kan's subtle guidance, the atmosphere in the auction hall grew increasingly heated, with bids rising and falling as the treasures sold for high prices.</p><p>Strangely, from the beginning of the auction, the person sitting in the corner remained leaning back in their chair, seemingly fast asleep.  These treasures didn't seem to pique their interest at all.</p><p>Mr. Kan, overseeing the entire scene, glanced at this person intentionally or unintentionally, a flicker of confusion in his eyes.</p><p>He had already received a report from his subordinates, knowing this person's Late Foundation Establishment cultivation.</p><p>In the cultivation world, Late Foundation Establishment was already considered a high level. Befriending a Late Foundation Establishment cultivator would be quite beneficial to the auction house, so Mr. Kan naturally didn't want to miss the opportunity.</p><p>He was skilled at catering to people's preferences, especially at auctions.  Even the most composed individuals found it difficult to hide their interest when encountering something they desired.</p><p>But this person hadn't even moved, completely unmoved.</p><p>"Could it be that these treasures are too ordinary?  Is this person's background so extraordinary that they don't even look at them?"</p><p>Mr. Kan continued the auction methodically, these thoughts swirling in his mind, and he couldn't help but sneer inwardly.</p><p>If it were before, he would have been helpless against such a person.</p><p>But this time was different. Among the later auction items, there were indeed a few that could be considered genuine treasures, accumulated over many years, with which he hoped to make a splash!</p><p>"I'd like to see how long you can keep up this act!"</p><p>Mr. Kan withdrew his gaze, no longer focusing on this person. Coincidentally, a jeweled crown fetched a high price, and he raised his voice, taking the opportunity to bring the atmosphere in the hall to another peak.</p>
