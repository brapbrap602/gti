<h1>Chapter 675: The Fiery Sparrow and the Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet</h1><p>"Greetings, senior! What would you like to purchase? I will fetch it for you."</p><p>The servant girl, a cultivator at the 8th level of Qi Condensation, possessed a worldly air, posing and gesturing coquettishly, her tone laced with flattery and allure.</p><p>Ran Luo had mentioned that many low-level cultivators in the Demon Sea, especially female cultivators, willingly served as concubines or even furnaces for high-level cultivators for survival and cultivation.</p><p>This was not uncommon in the Canglang Sea either, but at least it was always done discreetly, not so openly.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't feel entitled to dictate anything, saying calmly, "I wish to buy a spiritual material and two spirit herbs, all of at least rare quality.  Kindly take me to your manager."</p><p>A flicker of disappointment crossed the servant girl's eyes, but she responded with a "Yes," leading Qin Sang upstairs.</p><p>The manager was merely a cultivator at the later stages of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his aura, and the manager immediately welcomed him warmly, dismissing the servant girl.</p><p>Sitting down in the quiet room, Qin Sang got straight to the point, "I wish to purchase two things: the heavenly treasure Wan Shi Zhang, and the spirit herbs known as Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet and Soul-Guiding Grass.  Does your establishment happen to have them?"</p><p>The manager, understanding that Qin Sang was a cultivator who disliked being bothered with trivialities, responded calmly without further ado, "Please wait a moment, senior. I will check the warehouse. If we don't have them, it may take a while. I will contact the various trading houses on Tian Wu Island to inquire on your behalf, saving you the trouble."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang sized up the manager, a man of about fifty with a goatee, who seemed quite shrewd. No wonder he could be a manager on Tian Wu Island.</p><p>"Excellent. If you find what I need, you will be well-rewarded. I will wait here patiently."</p><p>"Thank you, senior."</p><p>The manager's face brightened, and he hastily left.</p><p>After more than half an hour, the manager returned, "My apologies for the wait, senior. I've had people inquire with the various trading houses, and none have Wan Shi Zhang or Soul-Guiding Grass. However, we discovered that the Wu Chen Trading House has two Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets, consigned by someone else.  Should I have them sent over, or…?"</p><p>As expected, no Wan Shi Zhang or Soul-Guiding Grass.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, but two Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets was already an unexpected windfall. He stood up, tossed a small pouch of spirit stones to the manager, and said, "Send someone to guide me there. By the way, do you know where I can buy the most detailed map, including the distribution of demonic beasts?"</p><p>Failing to find Wan Shi Zhang, he could only resort to the Fiery Sparrow.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously investigated several places with sporadic traces of Fiery Sparrows, but these locations were unlikely to have Wan Shi Zhang.</p><p>Wan Shi Zhang would at least attract a Fiery Sparrow flock. Only where numerous Fiery Sparrows were found could the presence of Wan Shi Zhang be almost certain.</p><p>The manager weighed the pouch, a delighted expression spreading across his face.  He responded repeatedly, "Not just a map, even the treasure list of the Grand Auction, I can get it for you. Just come back later to collect it, senior. I will arrange everything for you properly."</p><p>"You can even get the treasure list of the Grand Auction?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in a low voice, "Can you guarantee its accuracy?"</p><p>The manager thumped his chest, "Rest assured, senior. It's actually leaked by Tian Wu Island itself, so it's definitely accurate. However, the most valuable treasures are something no one can find out about; you can only know by attending the auction personally."</p><p>"Good, bring it as well."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet agreed with the Qiong Yu Trading House. If the Grand Auction had what he needed, he would wait until after the auction to decide where to go next.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the Wu Chen Trading House's branch, where the manager was already waiting, having received word.</p><p>"The senior who consigned the Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets requires a talismantreasure in exchange."</p><p>The manager of Wu Chen Trading House was a Wu clan woman.  She placed a jade box containing the Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the box to reveal two flowers lying flat.</p><p>Six petals spread naturally, like butterfly wings, their colors vibrant and strikingly beautiful.</p><p>"A talismantreasure?"</p><p>Hearing the exchange condition, Qin Sang calculated mentally. The value of the two Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets was slightly less than a complete talismantreasure, but they were something he urgently needed, so the exchange was acceptable.</p><p>However, two Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets were only enough for the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to reach the mid-stage of its second transformation, showing how difficult it was to cultivate a rare insect.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang produced a talismantreasure obtained from Jiu Pao Daoist.</p><p>The female manager took it and examined it, delightedly exclaiming, "Senior, this talismantreasure's power is intact—a rare treasure!"</p><p>"I'll contact that senior cultivator right away.  I'm sure he'll be willing to trade."</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>Qin Sang stopped the female attendant. "When you contact that cultivator, tell him I'd like to meet him, make a friend, and ask if he's willing."</p><p>The Yuling Sect's herbal formulary has a detailed description of the Six-Petaled Butterfly Violet.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized these two flowers immediately; they were definitely harvested within the last two years.</p><p>Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets don't grow alone; there are always several together.  This person might have more, or we could find out where he harvested them.  Either way, it's worth pursuing.</p><p>Seeing the attendant hesitate, Qin Sang's face darkened.  She said coldly, "I'll be meeting him here anyway.  Won't you get your share?"</p><p>The attendant's expression relaxed, and she hurried off.</p><p>Shortly after, heavy footsteps sounded outside. A strong Wu tribe man pushed open the door and strode in, grumbling, "If you want to buy herbs, just buy them.  Why go to all this trouble and summon me? I don't believe you're interested in making friends. Just say what you need."</p><p>The man sat down opposite Qin Sang, slapping a jade box on the table and staring at the talisman in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't get angry. She chuckled, "Wu Dao You are straightforward. Let me be direct, too. I want to buy these two Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets."</p><p>Qin Sang slid the talisman across the table.</p><p>The man examined it, exclaiming, "That girl wasn't lying. It's a top-quality talisman."</p><p>Qin Sang took the jade box from the man, putting it away, and continued, "I happen to know a bit about Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets.  When they appear, it's never just two. How many more do you have, Wu Dao You? I'll buy them all; the price is negotiable. Or perhaps you'd be willing to sell me the location where they grow?"</p><p>"So that's it? What kind of elixir are you refining that needs so many Six-Petaled Butterfly Violets?"</p><p>The man looked at Qin Sang in surprise, then pondered for a long time before saying, "I only have these two; I don't have any more.  As for the location, seeing as you've been so straightforward, I'll tell you. I don't want you causing me trouble later. There are a few more immature plants on that island, but it's a dangerous place. Getting these two was lucky; I wouldn't dare go back. Are you sure you want to buy them?"</p>
