<h1>Chapter 1864: Ancient Secrets</h1><p>A divine seal descended.</p><p>Three ancient characters, faintly glowing, remained on the seal's surface.  To Ling You Wang, these characters spun rapidly, like bottomless whirlpools threatening to suck his soul away.</p><p>Ling You Wang was terrified, sensing a threat from behind as the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light pierced the air.</p><p>He relied on the Swallowing Sea Clam to draw on the water essence from beyond the realm to maintain this power, and he couldn't recall it in time.</p><p>Attacked from both front and rear, both the divine seal and the divine light were incredibly dangerous.</p><p>Of the two, Ling You Wang feared the North Pole Killing Ghost Seal the most. This seal, during the heyday of the ancient Daoist schools, was infamous for its terrifying power, slaughtering countless monstrous beasts and striking fear into the hearts of demons and evil spirits. He dared not gamble on how much power it still held.</p><p>While the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light displayed formidable power during his fight with Qin Sang, it was ultimately limited.</p><p>Ling You Wang gritted his teeth and spat out a mouthful of blood, a scale embedded within.</p><p>This scale was similar in size and shape to the ones he'd used before, but this one was blood-red; whether stained or inherently so, he couldn't tell.</p><p>A strange light flickered on its surface, consuming all the blood.</p><p>The scale, now crimson, rapidly expanded, transforming into a gigantic blood-red shield in an instant.</p><p>Still uneasy, Ling You Wang swayed, spitting out a cinnabar talisman.  The talisman transformed into a beam of dark light, striking the shield.  A more intense blood-red light erupted, staining half the sky crimson.</p><p>The shield towered like a mountain, protecting Ling You Wang below.</p><p>Simultaneously, Ling You Wang's body rattled as scales burst open. A current of water, formed by his divine power, gathered around him, filling the gaps between the scales.</p><p>A white spiritual rope encircled his body several times, weaving nimbly between the scales, stringing them together like threads.</p><p>Ling You Wang donned a bizarre suit of scales, a combination of strength and flexibility.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the North Pole Killing Ghost Seal and the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light arrived simultaneously!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The blood-red shield trembled violently.</p><p>Compared to the massive shield, the small North Pole Killing Ghost Seal was like an insignificant ant on a mountain. But when this 'ant' struck the 'mountain', the mountain shook violently, threatening to crumble.</p><p>Green light filled the surface of the shield, abruptly suppressing the blood-red light.  A series of 'crackling' sounds accompanied the appearance of a noticeable dent where the North Pole Killing Ghost Seal struck, surrounded by a web of cracks.</p><p>Seeing the cracks, Ling You Wang was even more terrified, but he had no time to spare, as the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light had arrived.</p><p>'Whizz!'</p><p>The divine light was incredibly swift, impossible to avoid.</p><p>Ling You Wang mustered all his strength to concentrate the power of the scales.  The moment the divine light struck, he suddenly sensed something was wrong, filled with astonishment.  Before he could react, his shocked expression froze on his face.</p><p>The divine light did not possess the destructive power he expected.</p><p>The Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light has positive and negative aspects: positive for banishment, negative for annihilation. Outsiders are unaware of its subtle workings and cannot differentiate between them, making it extremely easy to fall victim.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang had used the positive aspect, specialized in sealing, allowing Mo Xing Dao and the others to repeatedly escape danger in the perilous Netherworld.</p><p>Unprepared, Ling You Wang was struck by the five-colored divine light. It didn't damage the scales but exploded like fireworks.</p><p>Five-colored light flowed over Ling You Wang's entire body.</p><p>He looked as if he were wearing five-colored armor, or trapped within a five-colored seal, his body stiff, unable to move.  His expression and eyes remained lifelike, frozen in a single moment.</p><p>In the forest.</p><p>All the golden armored warriors surrounded the altar of the Left Real Person, their golden ropes interlinked, forming another array.</p><p>Left Real Person closed his eyes, performing incantations repeatedly. Finally, he stamped his foot heavily, causing the altar to shake.  The golden armored warriors roared to the heavens, and the Left Real Person let out a sharp cry, suddenly opening his eyes, his gaze like lightning, piercing the sky.</p><p>The next moment, all the color drained from the Left Real Person's face, leaving it deathly pale, his legs appearing unsteady, as if he'd exhausted all his strength.</p><p>The surrounding golden armored warriors shifted their formation, becoming more intricate and compact.</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed from the heavens.</p><p>High above, the North Pole Killing Ghost Seal's power surged.  Several large cracks pierced the blood-red shield, and with a resounding crash, the entire shield shattered into pieces, completely destroyed.</p><p>Fragments scattered, unable to stop the North Pole Killing Ghost Seal.</p><p>The divine seal descended.</p><p>At that moment, Ling You Wang finally broke free from the confinement, dispelling the five-colored divine light from his body.  Opening his eyes, he saw the seal inches away, along with three rotating divine characters, a deep fear in his gaze.</p><p>Simultaneously, a thunderous sword cry erupted behind Ling You Wang.  The Yun You Sword followed, only slightly slower than the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light.</p><p>A heaven-splitting sword, like a startled rainbow!</p><p>The seal's green light engulfed Ling You Wang.</p><p>Ling You Wang let out a desperate roar, his scales rattling, unleashing his final power. But it was instantly suppressed by the green light.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A sound like thunder.</p><p>Scales shattered.</p><p>Just then, the Yun You Sword unleashed a breathtaking sword intent. Its light, like a dragon, pierced the green light.</p><p>Countless scales scattered, like a celestial maiden scattering flowers.</p><p>Each dark scale was bloody at the base; some turned to dust before leaving the green light's range.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Yun You Sword pierced the green light, its tip trailing a spray of blood, circled in the air, then plunged downwards.</p><p>A hole appeared in the celestial barrier. The seal, pinning a giant fish demon, smashed through the barrier and towards the earth.</p><p>Green light fell from the heavens. Within the light, the black fish's body stiffened, its eyes filled with disbelief. Its skull was caved in, the seal embedded in its forehead. A bloody wound, piercing its chest and abdomen, nearly severed it in two.</p><p>Demon blood stained the sky!</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the ground, looking up at the green light. He had slain a demon king!</p><p>The killing blow was dealt by the Yun You Sword and the seal working together.  However, truthfully, Left Daoist was the one most responsible.</p><p>That seal… what was its origin…?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Left Daoist, who had already put away his altar and stood among the golden-armored warriors. Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, he looked over and nodded slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Left Daoist's weakened state. The seal must be a Daoist treasure; Left Daoist's words were true. The cost of using it was indeed immense, though he wasn't sure how much was deliberate deception.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The green light plunged to the earth.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished to see that the blood flowing from the fish demon’s wound was being absorbed by the seal.</p><p>Still unsatisfied, the seal, enveloped in green light, began to consume the fish demon's flesh and bones, turning them into pure essence.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Left Daoist, who explained:  “The seal is also a cursed seal. Even I cannot stop it now; I can only let it have its fill.”</p><p>The two watched as Ling You Wang was devoured by the seal, leaving behind only a few belongings.</p><p>Thankfully, at the last moment, Left Daoist mustered his remaining strength to salvage Ling You Wang’s demon pill.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Beiji Killing Ghost Seal created a huge crater in the earth, scattering items everywhere.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>Left Daoist, his old wounds reopened and further aggravated, stored the seal in his sleeve. Without even looking at the spoils, he sat cross-legged to recuperate.</p><p>The golden-armored warriors formed a formation, protecting Left Daoist. With Ling You Wang dead, they were guarding against Qin Sang.</p><p>This was only natural. Qin Sang didn't mind, keeping his distance to avoid misunderstanding.</p><p>He glanced at the crater, seeing a dark demon pill and a smooth pearl.</p><p>Two spirit treasures lay scattered around, along with some scattered scales and scale-shield fragments.</p><p>“The pearl should be a type of spatial treasure…”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't move, glancing at them before withdrawing his gaze. He swallowed a few pills and focused on recovering his strength.</p><p>His spirit wood body hadn't reached its limit; only his true energy was severely depleted. Despite his injuries, his condition was better than Left Daoist’s.</p><p>He appeared calm, but his heart was unusually exhilarated.</p><p>He hadn't expected to benefit from misfortune.</p><p>This battle was significant for him.  Not only did he befriend a great Daoist master, but the feeling of slaying Ling You Wang with one sword would provide ample material for contemplation for a long time.</p><p>“Even without obtaining the Diamond Body, this journey was worthwhile!”</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>After recuperating, Qin Sang woke, temporarily suppressing his injuries. His true energy was sufficient for consecutive uses of the Thunder Escape. He looked down at his slightly damaged Ming Shan Armor, then at Left Daoist in the distance.</p><p>His complexion had slightly improved.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke:  “This is a dangerous place. Let’s leave. I know a safe place nearby for us to recover.  What do you think, senior?”</p><p>Ling You Wang must have left a mark when he chased him.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Ding Xiang Hou and his associates.  He had wounded Ding Xiang Hou, and the other demon marquises were weak. Even if they chased after him, seeing this scene, whether they would dare to enter was questionable.</p><p>He worried about other nearby demon kings. Ling You Wang had been too reckless, inviting his own doom.</p><p>After careful consideration, he decided to leave. His next destination wasn't far.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren remained motionless.</p><p>The foremost golden-armored warrior spoke, his voice deep and resonant, yet it was Zuo Zhenren's voice.</p><p>"Very well. Please lead the way, friend.  Please put those items away for now."</p><p>Before the words finished, the golden-armored warriors simultaneously swung their golden chains, forming a golden platform beneath Zuo Zhenren.</p><p>With a shout, the golden-armored warriors lifted the platform, transforming into bearers, rising into the air on golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his sleeve, separating a strand of true energy, wrapping up the spoils of war.  He didn't put them into his Qianjun Ring, but kept them suspended beside him. He then broke through the celestial barrier, leading the way and orienting himself.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren followed closely behind.</p><p>Flying out of the barrier, without encountering strong enemies, Qin Sang's mind relaxed slightly. He then heard the golden-armored warrior speak again: "No wonder Zhijian values you so highly.  Even among the rising stars of the Dao Court, few can compare to you."</p><p>"Senior is familiar with Zhijian?" Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>"We have some connection," Zuo Zhenren replied, seemingly unwilling to elaborate.</p><p>Qin Sang wisely didn't press further, shaking his head. "Senior is too kind. I know my own limitations.  Thanks to you, Senior, otherwise I would only have had to flee in disgrace and might not have lived to see tomorrow."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at the demon core beside him.</p><p>"This demon core, I need to take it back to the Dao Court," the golden-armored warrior pointed at the core, stating his request plainly. "Of course, you also deserve half the credit, and it won't be overlooked. This situation is special; this demon core will likely be considered a true Demon King's core...If you're uneasy, you can keep it for now."</p><p>Qin Sang also wanted the Demon King's core, but after careful consideration, he nodded in agreement.</p><p>"As for the rest..."</p><p>The golden-armored warrior glanced at the other three items. "Let's simply divide them equally."</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally delighted. He ordered the Tianmu Butterfly to remain vigilant, and used his spiritual sense to probe the pearl, discovering a restriction inside.</p><p>This restriction was unlike anything he had ever seen, extremely intricate.</p><p>Afraid of damaging the treasures inside, Qin Sang dared not act rashly, but Zuo Zhenren knew how. Under Zuo Zhenren's guidance, Qin Sang gradually grasped the pattern.</p><p>Soon, the two passed through several illusions, their destination now before them.</p><p>"It's there," Qin Sang pointed, breaking through the illusionary barrier first.</p><p>The wood spirit energy rushed towards them, but it was much thinner than in the Forest Domain.</p><p>This was a world with hundreds of floating islands. Most were covered in vegetation, with a pervasive sense of death. The islands were full of hidden dangers, yet different from anything before, with the danger increasing the deeper they went.</p><p>Qin Sang chose a suitable island and set up a poison array, though it wasn't used.</p><p>He landed on an island at the edge. After a while, the golden-armored warrior carried Zuo Zhenren in, landing on a nearby island.</p><p>Silence fell between them.</p><p>Finally, the pearl in Qin Sang's hand emitted a brilliant light, which Qin Sang quickly concealed with a spell.</p><p>The next moment, the pearl shot out a ray of light, scattering various items onto the ground.</p><p>The golden-armored warrior looked over.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, surveying the spoils of war. He felt a wave of dizziness.</p><p>While they agreed to split things equally, it relied on their individual discernment.  Missing a treasure due to lack of knowledge wasn't something to blame the other for.</p><p>After looking for a while, Qin Sang felt a headache coming on. Some treasures were clearly extraordinary, yet he had never seen or heard of them before, making it impossible to judge their value.</p><p>The Sea-Swallowing Clam and the white rope were placed together.</p><p>Besides these, there were two spiritual treasures within the pearl, which Ling You Wang hadn't used, perhaps because he didn't understand the Treasure-Passing Technique.  Moreover, at Ling You Wang's level, spiritual treasures were valued for their quality, not quantity.  Excess treasures would be given to subordinates. The Sea-Swallowing Clam was clearly different from ordinary spiritual treasures.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, none of the four spiritual treasures had the Treasure-Passing Technique.</p><p>"If I take these spiritual treasures, will you mind, friend?" the golden-armored warrior pointed at them.</p><p>This was also a kindness.  These treasures, once delivered to the Dao Court, could be tried by Daoist disciples, and someone would eventually find a compatible one. In Qin Sang's hands, they would only be wasted and couldn't be sold for a high price.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed and immediately handed over the four spiritual treasures, contemplating what he should choose.</p><p>At that moment, the Altar space began to tremble, a frequent occurrence lately.</p><p>The golden-armored warrior turned towards the depths of the Altar, pondering for a moment before asking, "Qingfeng, you've accomplished great feats this time. What reward do you intend to request from the Dao Court?"</p><p>From beginning to end, Zuo Zhenren didn't ask why Qin Sang was pursued by Ling You Wang, and Qin Sang pretended to be oblivious.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, thought carefully, stood up, bowed respectfully, and said, "Junior knows how difficult cultivation is, lacking a good teacher.  My intention is to seek guidance on the mysteries of the Five Talismans realm, and the essentials of cultivation... I don't know what these merits can be exchanged for. Could Senior perhaps instruct me?"</p><p>"The essentials of cultivation... Indeed, you are a true seeker of the Dao, but..."</p><p>The golden-armored warrior nodded approvingly, then asked, "Do you know why we, and those Demon Kings, are willing to self-limit our cultivation to enter this Altar?"</p><p>"I came here unexpectedly and don't know," Qin Sang shook his head, truthfully.</p><p>"The ancient Daoist sect once established the Divine Court, the root of Talisman Dao..."</p><p>Zuo Zhenren spoke slowly.</p><p>He couldn't explain it in as much detail as the old Daoist, but without revealing true secrets, a brief explanation to Qin Sang of the reasons was sufficient. </p>
