<h1>Chapter 1953: The Chessboard</h1><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>Here, even the wind took on a form, the form of flames.</p><p>Blazing infernos drifted atop the surface of magma, howling as they came and went.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, there was no color other than crimson.</p><p>Occasionally, 'splashes' could be seen in the magma, strange figures flashing in and out of existence.</p><p>This was a pure ocean of magma, without a single piece of land in sight. Only fire beasts with unique bloodlines, and fire spirits born from the flames, could survive here.</p><p>They were unafraid of the environment, weaving through the magma like fish in water.</p><p>Suddenly, the fiery winds here paused for a moment, gradually revealing two illusory human figures.</p><p>These two were Ling Shi and Gui Hou.</p><p>Gui Hou, with a Fire Jade Centipede coiled around his arm, seemed to be communicating with it.  Then, he pointed downwards.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ling, it's here! Lord Zhuque mentioned before that some Umbral Lily Flowers grow beneath this magma.  I just don't know if their medicinal properties will meet your requirements."</p><p>"Umbral Lily Flowers prefer to grow in places where the power of flames is most potent and violent, absorbing fire toxins as nourishment.  The environment greatly influences their quality. If I were using them myself, high-grade Umbral Lily Flowers would suffice. However, this time I need to refine a virulent poison requested by Senior, and it requires top-grade quality."</p><p>Ling Shi gently twitched his nose, using a secret technique to sense the surroundings, and nodded. "This place is good, it has the potential to nurture top-grade Umbral Lily Flowers. Let's go, let's take a look!"</p><p>The two plummeted downwards, the magma parting on either side before closing up again in the blink of an eye, returning to normal.</p><p>The magma was bottomless.</p><p>Gui Hou led the way, continuously descending, and asked via sound transmission, "Fellow Daoist Ling, do you mean that there can only be a few top-grade flowers in the entire patch? How many are needed to refine the virulent poison?"</p><p>"The more, the better!" Ling Shi replied.</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Gui Hou frowned. "In the entire Fire Domain, I'm afraid there aren't many places like this. And once a patch reaches a certain size, it's likely to be claimed. The three major Sects of the Fire Domain are all proficient in fire-based cultivation methods, and there are also numerous smaller powers. Even if they don't cultivate Umbral Lily Flowers, they can develop it into a medicinal field."</p><p>"Let's do our best. This isn't the only option!  Besides, Senior is incredibly powerful and certainly has a way. If he wanted to unify the Fire Domain, wouldn't it be a simple matter?"  Ling Shi said in a relaxed tone.</p><p>When he was brought back by Qin Sang, Ling Shi was initially apprehensive, but now he felt at ease.</p><p>Here, he only needed to focus on comprehending the Dao of Poisons and developing various virulent toxins.  Qin Sang would fully support him, no matter the request.</p><p>This kind of treatment was usually reserved for Grandmasters of Alchemy.</p><p>Although there was a saying that alchemy and poison-making were two sides of the same coin, and Ling Shi did understand some alchemy, his cultivation of poisonous arts wasn't solely focused on refining poisons.  Moreover, without a proper alchemical inheritance, he couldn't compare to a true Alchemy Grandmaster.</p><p>The price was restricted freedom, but he was already targeted by the Soulfall Abyss, leaving him with no choice.</p><p>Gui Hou couldn't be as casual as Ling Shi. He shook his head and said, "While that's true, as subordinates, we must do our best to share Master's burdens."</p><p>As they spoke, the two descended to an extreme depth.</p><p>The temperature here not only hadn't decreased, but the blazing, violent aura nurtured by heaven and earth had become even more intense.</p><p>Gradually, the magma became invisible to the naked eye, transforming into pure streams of fire flowing from all directions.</p><p>It was unimaginable what kind of apocalyptic scene it would be if these forces erupted.</p><p>"Fire Domain cultivators call this place a Blaze Pool, where the power of flames undergoes a transformation. Within a powerful Blaze Pool, we must be cautious. Umbral Lily Flowers are connected to the Blaze Pool's energy. We must be careful when harvesting them to avoid causing an eruption."</p><p>Gui Hou warned.</p><p>As he spoke, they descended further, deliberately slowing down.</p><p>The surrounding scenery changed dramatically, and even these two Nascent Soul experts felt a primal sense of oppression.</p><p>Without any warning, the surroundings suddenly became calm.</p><p>Here, not a single turbulent current could be seen.</p><p>However, this tranquility felt incredibly eerie, as if immense power was accumulating here, ready to explode and destroy everything.</p><p>There was fire here too, burning quietly. The flames were a faint blue, swaying gently, giving off a sense of fragility.</p><p>They cautiously entered this space, avoiding the flames, and soon found a patch of shadow within the blue flames.</p><p>The shadow wasn't completely dark, emitting a dim blue light.</p><p>Within the light, scattered sparsely, were some flowers, shaped like lilies, their petals also a dim blue, some deep, others lighter in color.</p><p>There was no soil here. They floated, and one could clearly see countless blue roots growing from their base, extending into the flames, absorbing 'nutrients' from the fire.</p><p>"One, two... there are actually five top-grade Umbral Lily Flowers!"</p><p>Ling Shi's face lit up with joy.  He had expected only two or three at most.</p><p>He flashed to the side of a top-grade Umbral Lily Flower, his right hand reaching towards the root ball.</p><p>His fingers flicked gently, and strange fluctuations emanated from his fingertips, enveloping the root ball.</p><p>Ling Shi was fully focused, his movements gentle yet decisive. He carefully supported the root ball, then patiently picked out the roots from the flames one by one.</p><p>It took him about ten days to harvest a single Umbral Lily Flower.</p><p>Gui Hou watched him retrieve a complete flower and then offered his assistance.</p><p>Just as the two were concentrating on harvesting the spirit flowers, they suddenly sensed something and paused, exchanging glances.</p><p>"Someone's coming!" Gui Hou said gravely.</p><p>This magma was inhabited by countless fire beasts and fire spirits, and was inherently chaotic.</p><p>While harvesting in the Blaze Pool, they couldn't be aware of every fluctuation outside. If someone was merely passing by, they wouldn't be alerted.</p><p>However, the newcomer seemed unusual, fleeing here in a panic, as if being pursued, plunging headlong into the magma.</p><p>Both Gui Hou and Ling Shi possessed sufficient composure and didn't act rashly. They judged the direction of the uninvited guest's movement based on the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>"He's not coming here," Gui Hou's expression eased slightly.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, they sensed another aura, close behind.</p><p>Ling Shi uttered a "Just as I thought," then added in surprise, "It's two Nascent Soul cultivators!"</p><p>There weren't many Nascent Soul cultivators in the Fire Domain.  To encounter two at once, and they were chasing and fleeing…</p><p>"There might be people from the three major Sects of the Fire Domain, but it has nothing to do with us. The important thing is at hand," Gui Hou shook his head, but then noticed the change in Ling Shi's expression.</p><p>"The one behind… is a Corpse Demon from the Soulfall Abyss!"</p><p>Ling Shi's eyes flashed with a cold light, and he sneered, "These things, neither human nor ghost, I can smell their corpse stench even through the magma!"</p><p>…</p><p>Upper levels.</p><p>A crimson streak of light rapidly traversed the magma.</p><p>Within the escaping light was a burly man. If Qin Sang were here, he would recognize him as Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect. Qin Sang, in his transformed state, had lured Fu Xiao over when he eradicated the Sand Bandits.</p><p>Now, Fu Xiao's robust and sturdy body was hunched over, his face ashen, clearly suffering from serious injuries.</p><p>On his chest was a gaping wound, his robes pierced through.</p><p>The wound almost went straight through to his back, and his internal organs had inevitably been severely damaged.</p><p>The most troublesome thing wasn't the injury itself, but the layer of green flames covering the surface of the wound.</p><p>This layer of green fire clung to his flesh like a leech, preventing the wound from healing and devouring his life force.  Even consuming vast quantities of healing pills was useless.</p><p>'Huff! Huff! Huff!'</p><p>As he flew, Fu Xiao formed hand seals and spewed a ball of spiritual fire from his mouth.</p><p>The spiritual fire landed on his chest, entangling with the green fire, but it couldn't eradicate it.</p><p>He spat out several more mouthfuls, only managing to temporarily suppress the green fire.</p><p>Moreover, he discovered an even more terrifying phenomenon: the green fire was silently invading his internal organs.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, he had several methods to extinguish the green fire. But now, seriously injured and with pursuers behind him, his situation was precarious, and no method would work.</p><p>He mentally calculated the distance to his sect, growing even more anxious. At this rate, he would die before he could escape back.</p><p>He had accidentally stumbled upon the Corpse Demon's hiding place, but hadn't expected another one lurking in the shadows. Careless for a moment, he was ambushed, and the magical tool for contacting his sect was also destroyed. He was truly in dire straits.</p><p>From behind, the sinister aura relentlessly pursued him, rapidly closing in.</p><p>Chasing him was a streak of green flames, extremely conspicuous within the magma.</p><p>Within the green fire was another tall figure, appearing even more robust than Fu Xiao. It was one of the individuals Qin Sang had alarmed when he activated the copper pillars.</p><p>The others' whereabouts were unknown, only this tall man was pursuing Fu Xiao alone.</p><p>"Hmph! If Lord Fei Luo hadn't returned to report and Rou Ji wasn't injured, how could you have escaped alive!  Stay here!"</p><p>The tall man shouted coldly, his robes billowing.  Suddenly, streams of green flames surged from his body, transforming him into a man of fire.</p><p>The green fire spread, instantly dyeing the surrounding magma green, the green magma instantly shifting from scorching hot to chillingly cold.</p><p>The green fire spread incredibly quickly.  Fu Xiao had just sensed something amiss when he was already enveloped by the green magma, a warning flaring within his instincts.</p><p>Without any warning, a ghostly white claw emerged from the green fire, its five fingers like sharp swords, grabbing towards his back.</p><p>If this strike landed, Fu Xiao would surely be in grave danger.</p><p>Fortunately, he had taken precautions.  A fiery red pattern, formed by flames, appeared on his back, resembling a Bagua but with subtle differences.</p><p>As the Bagua fire diagram appeared, a muffled thunderclap echoed.</p><p>Struck by the ghost claw, the fire diagram trembled violently, cracks appearing, but it successfully blocked the ghost claw for a moment.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity to lunge forward, intending to distance himself from his pursuer.  Unexpectedly, he felt another gust of yin wind.</p><p>The ghost claw was uncanny, appearing right in front of him, aiming straight for his face.</p><p>Fu Xiao's expression changed drastically.  But amidst the panic, a hint of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes.  He opened his mouth wide, and instead of flames, a bead shot out.</p><p>This bead shone with an exceptionally brilliant luster. It was called the Crimson Seal Bead, a treasure Fu Xiao heavily relied on.  Now, to escape, he could only bear the pain of destroying it!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Crimson Seal Bead shot towards the ghost claw. The ghost claw immediately sensed the danger and its five fingers curled, about to retreat into the green magma.</p><p>However, the ghost claw was too close to Fu Xiao, and Fu Xiao had planned this for a long time, his timing impeccable.</p><p>With a 'Boom', the Crimson Seal Bead exploded, a fire serpent wrapped in fragments, its teeth and claws bared, charged out.</p><p>A furious roar erupted from within the magma.  The ghost claw, unable to retreat in time, simply didn't retract. Its five fingers spread wide, and embedded in its palm was a black eye, swiveling left and right, like a living creature, incredibly bizarre.</p><p>With a blink of the eye, a black beam shot out from the pupil, meeting the fire serpent formed by the Crimson Seal Bead.</p><p>The moment the two forces collided, a human figure vaguely appeared behind the ghost claw, retreating backwards.</p><p>The power of the Crimson Seal Bead was immense, instantly destroying the black beam.</p><p>The tall man appeared rather disheveled, but hadn't suffered serious injuries, having mostly dodged the attack.</p><p>However, the green fire that had permeated the magma could no longer be maintained.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the chance to escape, flicking his sleeves. Several streaks of light shot towards his enemy, and then, without even looking at the result, he chose a direction and fled with all his might.</p><p>He remembered a Six Harmonies Sect ruin from thousands of years ago.</p><p>The brief exchange had drastically aggravated Fu Xiao's injuries.  He knew that relying solely on his own power, escaping from the clutches of the Corpse Demon was nearly impossible.</p><p>He hoped the ruins were still there; it was his only hope!</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi temporarily stopped harvesting and quietly left the Blaze Pool.</p><p>They didn't approach the battlefield too closely, but based on the fluctuations emanating from there, they could deduce what had transpired with a fair degree of accuracy.</p><p>"It's the Azure Surge Art of the Six Harmonies Sect!"  Gui Hou rarely ventured out, but he had some understanding of the surrounding powers, especially the three major Sects of the Fire Domain.</p><p>"A Corpse Demon from the Soulfall Abyss chasing a Six Harmonies Sect expert here… don't you find it suspicious, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Ling Shi was eager to get involved. "The Soulfall Abyss is extending its clutches into the Fire Domain again. They must have some grand scheme!  We'd best investigate this thoroughly and be prepared, lest it disturb Senior's cultivation!"</p><p>Gui Hou glanced at Ling Shi.  He knew Ling Shi had a grudge against the Soulfall Abyss and certainly wanted to take this opportunity to vent his anger.</p><p>Ling Shi's words did carry some weight.</p><p>However, Gui Hou also had to consider whether their rash intervention would attract the attention of a Soulfall Abyss ancestor when there might have been no issue otherwise.</p><p>Having followed Qin Sang from the Rune Realm to the Great Thousand World, Gui Hou knew that Qin Sang hadn't broken through to Void Refinement through normal means.  Facing a true Void Refinement cultivator, he might not have the advantage and should consolidate his foundation, delaying such encounters as long as possible.</p><p>"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. This guy isn't particularly important in the Soulfall Abyss. There must be more than just him infiltrating the Fire Domain. Under the old monster, there are several late Nascent Soul stage demons.  The loss of a single Corpse Demon wouldn't even make him blink," Ling Shi asserted confidently.</p><p>Just as they were in disagreement, they suddenly heard a voice.</p><p>They immediately stopped and showed respectful expressions, listening attentively for a moment before bowing towards the void in unison.</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Only after the voice disappeared did they straighten up.</p><p>Ling Shi laughed heartily. "Just as I expected, Senior has already seen through everything!"</p><p>Gui Hou didn't comment, but looked ahead and quickly followed. "Fellow Daoist Ling, we need to discuss our plan. Master wants him captured alive. There must be no mistakes.  We can only rely on your poison skills next."</p><p>"Easy! The Corpse Demons of the Soulfall Abyss constantly refine corpse poison.  Ordinary toxins are ineffective against them.  However, my poison arts are an exception.  I'll make sure he never returns!"</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Daoist Abode.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sat cross-legged on a stone bed, surrounded by twinkling stars.</p>
