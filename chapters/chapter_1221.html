<h1>Chapter 1213: Escape</h1><p>After witnessing the terrifying power of the Blood Filth Divine Light during the battle at the Purple Palace, all the cultivators coveted a piece of the Endless Blood Mulberry to refine their magical treasures. The Frost Domain had ventured into the Boundless Valley multiple times in search of it, but to no avail. They began to suspect that the Endless Blood Mulberry had been completely gathered by the Sin Abyss, and the matter was eventually left unresolved. The Endless Blood Mulberry had only appeared briefly, and over the years, Jiang Chenzi and the others had gradually forgotten about it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Blood Filth Divine Light reappeared here, and this time, it was directed at them. Truly, the Heavenly Dao's cycle of retribution is inexorable.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Blood Filth Divine Light, seemingly slow but actually swift, drifted down onto the treasure banner. Jiang Chenzi had no time to withdraw it and could only watch helplessly as the banner trembled and, in the blink of an eye, lost its radiance. The three treasure banners were indispensable, and with one of them contaminated, the spirit formation inevitably began to falter.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>They hadn't anticipated that Qin Sang still had this trick up his sleeve. Jiang Chenzi frantically poured his true essence into the tottering banner, trying to salvage the situation.</p><p>Elder Demon Ye had already appeared above the blood pool at some point, intending to refine the cultivator surnamed Lu and the Frost Lizard within the blood. Sensing the damage to the banner formation, Elder Demon Ye frowned slightly, showing a hint of dissatisfaction, but his expression remained calm, devoid of surprise or urgency. He casually raised his hand, reaching out to grab Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, an unexpected change occurred within the blood pool.</p><p>A roar, unlike any human sound, erupted from the depths of the blood. The sound was piercing, filled with agony, like a demonic voice piercing the mind. Everyone who heard it furrowed their brows, feeling an intense discomfort.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A powerful force erupted violently, causing the blood to surge backward. At the same time, a terrifying chill spread from within. Some of the eerie blood had been frozen into ice by the frigid wind. A glowing blue orb slowly rose from the center of the explosion, resembling the snow pearl the Frost Lizard had wielded earlier, but the chill it emitted was far more intense than before.</p><p>A Frost Lizard, its body towering dozens of feet high, raised its head proudly, the snow pearl resting atop its crown. Its limbs, like massive pillars, stomped through the river of blood, its eyes filled with rage as it coldly stared at Elder Demon Ye.</p><p>Under the Frost Lizard's gaze, Elder Demon Ye's heart tightened. His calm expression flickered slightly, and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Among the four who had ventured into the Abyssal Ruins, the cultivator surnamed Lu and the Serpent King were both mid-stage Nascent Soul experts. Qin Sang, with the lowest cultivation level, possessed extraordinary abilities and treasures, making him the most formidable. Only the Frost Lizard, at the early stage of transformation, seemed unremarkable and not worth worrying about.</p><p>But now, the Frost Lizard had completely defied everyone's expectations. Not only had its size increased dramatically, becoming incredibly fierce and majestic, but the aura it exuded was also incomparable to before, causing even Elder Demon Ye to feel a deep sense of caution.</p><p>Elder Demon Ye's gaze shifted rapidly, finally landing on the area beneath the Frost Lizard's body, where he spotted the cultivator surnamed Lu. In stark contrast to the Frost Lizard, the cultivator surnamed Lu was pale, his aura extremely weak. His injuries seemed to have suddenly worsened, far more severe than before.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Lu and Elder Demon Ye locked eyes, their expressions equally calm, as if they weren't in a life-and-death struggle.</p><p>"What kind of secret technique is this? It seems the cultivator surnamed Lu has poured all his cultivation into the Frost Lizard..." Elder Demon Ye instantly deduced the reason for this transformation.</p><p>Earlier, the Frost Lizard and the cultivator surnamed Lu had remained motionless, likely preparing this secret technique. But what puzzled Elder Demon Ye was that the Frost Lizard bore no mark of the cultivator surnamed Lu—it wasn't his spirit beast—yet it had mastered such a powerful joint attack technique.</p><p>This thought flashed through his mind in an instant, for Elder Demon Ye heard the Frost Lizard's roar and immediately sensed danger. He retracted his hand, which had been reaching for Qin Sang, and pressed it toward the snow pearl instead.</p><p>At the same time, the snow pearl erupted with a dazzling radiance, like a dark blue sun.</p><p>Elder Demon Ye's expression turned grave. His fingers spread wide, and thin threads of blood shot out from his fingertips. The blood below was swallowed by these threads, rapidly condensing into a strange blood-colored diagram.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The moment the blood-colored diagram took shape, the dark blue sun collided with it violently. Blood light and cold light clashed and merged, sending out shockwaves that created a chaotic void, obscuring everything, including the figures of the cultivator surnamed Lu and the Frost Lizard.</p><p>Elder Demon Ye's figure flickered as he was forced to retreat upward, temporarily avoiding the brunt of the attack. The Frost Lizard's current strength was evident.</p><p>On the other side, after Qin Sang disabled one of the treasure banners, causing a flaw in the spirit formation, he and the Serpent King activated their magical treasures, repelling Jiang Chenzi's attempts to block them, and charged outward together.</p><p>Feeling the terrifying fluctuations from below and witnessing the entire process through the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang was slightly surprised. He hadn't expected them to have such a move. As expected, these Nascent Soul cultivators and great demons all had their own trump cards.</p><p>But he wondered, with the cultivator surnamed Lu severely injured and the Frost Lizard forcibly enhancing its power through a secret technique, would they still have the strength to escape the ensuing pursuit after breaking free from the blood's restraints?</p><p>Qin Sang and the Serpent King exchanged a glance.</p><p>Qin Sang still intended to follow the original plan and head to the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters. Although the Frost Lizard would tear open the blood's blockade, Elder Demon Ye appeared unharmed and still had strength to spare. If they descended now, they would still have to face Elder Demon Ye, and they would first have to pass through the malevolent spirits, risking everything if they weren't careful.</p><p>This was for the best.</p><p>As expected, the Frost Lizard and the cultivator surnamed Lu would likely break through the blood and escape the Abyssal Ruins, while Qin Sang and the Serpent King would take the path through the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Dividing their forces would scatter the Sin Abyss's strength.</p><p>As for the malevolent spirits, Qin Sang had already thought of a way to deal with them. Over the past few days, while searching for fragments of the Slaughter Sword in the Abyssal Ruins, Qin Sang had become very familiar with the ancient restrictions scattered throughout the ruins. He knew that on their way back, they would pass by several ancient restrictions that they could use to their advantage.</p><p>Although they couldn't kill the malevolent spirits, they could trap them momentarily and shake them off.</p><p>"Let's go!" the Serpent King said gravely, sharing Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>He had chosen to help Qin Sang after careful consideration, not because he was abandoning his companions or using the Frost Lizard and the cultivator surnamed Lu as bait. If he had decisively charged downward earlier, coordinating with the Frost Lizard to repel Elder Demon Ye, it might have seemed easier to break through the blood river's blockade.</p><p>But if Qin Sang had failed to break through the banner formation of Jiang Chenzi and the other two, and Elder Demon Ye had gained the assistance of three Nascent Soul cultivators, the power of the blood river would have been far greater. Once the full might of the banner formation was unleashed, they would have been trapped like caged beasts.</p><p>Only by acting as they did could the four of them successfully break free from the prison and escape separately. As for whether they could survive the ensuing pursuit, that would depend on their own abilities.</p><p>With that, they flew deeper into the Abyssal Ruins without a second glance below, taking the malevolent spirits with them.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi, furious and desperate, joined forces with the other two Nascent Soul cultivators to make one last effort to delay them. But with the spirit formation already damaged, Jiang Chenzi and the others had lost the initiative. By the time they tried to block Qin Sang and the Serpent King, it was already too late.</p><p>Qin Sang was skilled in escape techniques, and the Serpent King's cultivation was second only to Elder Demon Ye's, so their speed was naturally not slow. With a casual swing of their swords and blades, they easily repelled the hasty attacks from Jiang Chenzi and the others.</p><p>In a few flashes, Qin Sang and the Serpent King broke through all obstacles and entered a gap in the dark clouds. The Serpent King, unfamiliar with the path, could only follow closely behind Qin Sang. Together, they fended off the attacks of the malevolent spirits as they flew toward the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters.</p>
