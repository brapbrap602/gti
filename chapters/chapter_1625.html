<h1>Chapter 1616 Departure</h1><p>After mastering the *Gold and Jade Manipulation Art*, controlling gold and jade-type magical treasures became even more effortless, their power greatly amplified.  Should an opponent use a jade treasure, this Dao Art could be used to disrupt and diminish its power.</p><p>With one side waning and the other waxing, Yu Zhi held a clear advantage, becoming Yang Zhenren's bane.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of the multitude, Yang Zhenren ceased his offensive, his brow furrowed in thought.</p><p>The crowd held its breath, anticipating how Yang Zhenren would break the deadlock.</p><p>"I initially disapproved of Seventh Sister choosing the *Gold and Jade Manipulation Art*, but there are times when it truly yields miraculous results..."</p><p>Jin Wudai paused mid-sentence, noticing the monk entering at this moment, and shifted his gaze.</p><p>The monk approached Abbot Xingji, whispered something in his ear, and handed him a jade talisman.</p><p>Abbot Xingji's expression remained unreadable, but he immediately rose to depart.</p><p>"Where is the Master going?"</p><p>Jin Wudai called out, stopping Abbot Xingji.</p><p>"Amitabha, a small matter. This poor monk will return shortly. I beg Sect Master Jin to pardon my rudeness." Abbot Xingji's words were vague, and Jin Wudai, unable to press further, watched with a puzzled expression.</p><p>Abbot Xingji and his entourage occupied the most prominent seats, and his actions immediately drew everyone's attention.  Countless eyes followed Abbot Xingji as he left the Dharma Assembly, speculating about what had transpired.</p><p>For a time, the duel on the stage was forgotten.</p><p>Abbot Xingji left the assembly grounds, heading straight back to the temple where he was staying.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang was discussing the hunt for the fiend with Holy King Qinghu. Sensing Abbot Xingji's aura, he turned towards the door: "Has something happened at the Dharma Assembly?"</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang's tone was calm, yet veiled a murderous intent.</p><p>Luring the snake out of its hole had indeed proven effective!</p><p>Abbot Xingji presented the jade talisman with both hands, his voice grave: "The Myriad Venom Mountain sends word: The lost legacy of the Unfettered Immortal Sect has appeared in the Southern Prefecture!"</p><p>"The Unfettered Immortal Sect?"</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang accepted the talisman and examined it, his surprise evident. "The lost legacy is in the Taiyue Mountains?"</p><p>Immediately, Holy Sage Huiguang realized the problem. "For remnants of the Unfettered Immortal Sect to infiltrate the Taiyue Mountains and open their lost legacy, it couldn't have been done overnight. They must have been planning this for a while. You detected nothing?"</p><p>Abbot Xingji replied shamefully, "The monastery has not been lax, yet we received no warning."</p><p>"Unless someone helped them conceal it!"</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang snorted coldly, but did not blame Abbot Xingji.</p><p>Abbot Xingji was chosen as the abbot for his undeniable abilities and meticulous nature, perfectly suited for the position, and had earned Holy Sage Huiguang's approval.</p><p>"Where is Zi Lei?"</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang immediately grasped the crux of the matter.</p><p>The remnants of the Unfettered Immortal Sect would leave traces of their activities.  They could use other methods to disguise themselves and mislead the Nectar Dew Monastery's judgment, but they couldn't possibly appear out of thin air without a single whisper beforehand.</p><p>It was too strange!</p><p>Both the Dao and Buddhist sects were hunting down the remnants of the Unfettered Immortal Sect.  The Eight Sceneries Sect knew the Nectar Dew Monastery's arrangements best; only they could help the remnants deceive the monastery right under their noses.</p><p>Furthermore, the connection between the Taiyue Sect and the Eight Sceneries Sect was public knowledge. With the lost legacy in the Taiyue Mountains, it was even more convenient for the Eight Sceneries Sect to act.</p><p>The moment he received the news, Abbot Xingji had already thought of this. He remained composed at the assembly and sought Holy Sage Huiguang's decision. "Realist Zi Lei is at the Dharma Assembly. I have instructed two of my disciples to keep a close watch on him."</p><p>"No need. That one must be an imposter!"</p><p>With Holy Sage Huiguang's wisdom, he instantly deduced the Eight Sceneries Sect's motive for such a move. They must have mistakenly believed True Monarch Danyu had fallen and become suspicious of him.</p><p>"That Zi Lei, suspicious by nature and audacious, dares to harbor remnants of the Unfettered Immortal Sect!  Letting the Heaven Concord Palace enter the Heaven Image Palace â€“ doesn't he fear releasing the ancient devil sealed within, unleashing another catastrophe? If the ancient devil hadn't already ascended with the Immortal Palace, the consequences would have been dire."</p><p>Pausing, Holy Sage Huiguang commanded Abbot Xingji, "Quickly gather your men and proceed to the Southern Prefecture. We shall capture these remnants of the Unfettered Immortal Sect in one fell swoop!"</p><p>Abbot Xingji accepted the order and departed. Holy Sage Huiguang turned to Holy King Qinghu, "You heard, fellow Daoist. The lost legacy of the Unfettered Immortal Sect has emerged, saving us the trouble of searching.  When the Unfettered Immortal Sect's legacy was hastily sealed, many scriptures should have been preserved within.  They controlled the Immortal Palaces longer than the Delusion Palace, and the Sword Tomb Secret Realm was also discovered by them first.  Their understanding of the Immortal Palaces is unparalleled."</p><p>Holy King Qinghu waved a jade hand, the cartographic map dissolving into countless points of light and vanishing into thin air.  She spoke languidly, "This King isn't going to hang myself on the fiend beast's single thread. Even if we capture it, with demonic whispers and fiend beasts lurking along the way, it's still uncertain whether you and I will reach the Return to Emptiness alive. Since the lost legacy of the Unfettered Immortal Sect has appeared, we naturally must journey to the Southern Prefecture. Perhaps we will find some clues there."</p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators, without further hesitation, set off south!</p><p>...</p><p>On the stage.</p><p>The duel between the two sides was unaffected by Abbot Xingji's departure, and a victor had emerged.</p><p>As Seventh Precept Zhenren had predicted, Yang Zhenren, his magical treasure suppressed, was no match for Yu Zhi and conceded defeat.</p><p>The elder of the Gold Jade Sect presiding over the Dharma Assembly flew onto the stage and declared Yu Zhi the winner. He was about to invite the next pair of combatants.</p><p>"We invite Chan Master Xiaoxing of the Nectar Dew Monastery and... and..."</p><p>The Gold Jade Sect elder faltered mid-sentence.</p><p>Abbot Xingji had returned, and at his command, a large group from the Nectar Dew Monastery's seating area rose and left the assembly without a backward glance.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Jin Wudai was startled and uncertain.</p><p>Just as he was about to stop Abbot Xingji to inquire, he saw the experts of the Eight Sceneries Sect also departing.</p><p>In a Dharma Assembly held once every five hundred years, the two leading sects left only a few members to observe. Such a strange occurrence had never been seen before.</p><p>Soon, whispers of rumors began circulating within the assembly, quickly escalating into an uproar.</p><p>"Trouble in the Southern Prefecture!"</p><p>"An Immortal Estate has appeared!"</p><p>"It's said to be the work of the Taiyue Sect. No wonder Yue Lingtian isn't present!"</p><p>"The Nectar Dew Monastery and the Eight Sceneries Sect are definitely heading to the Immortal Estate!"</p><p>"An ancient Immortal Estate, a tremendous opportunity! I wonder if it's too late to go now! I should have never bothered with this blasted Dharma Assembly!"  Regret filled the air.</p><p>...</p><p>Quickly, the high-ranking members of various sects confirmed through different channels that an Immortal Estate had indeed appeared in the Southern Prefecture; it wasn't just a rumor.</p><p>And the information they received was more precise.</p><p>The Immortal Estate was most likely the lost legacy of the Unfettered Immortal Sect!</p><p>The powers of the Central Plains knew something of the Unfettered Immortal Sect, aware that it was the sole overlord of the Central Prefecture before the Dao and Buddhist Sects. Within its lost legacy, there must be countless secret treasures and a great inheritance!</p><p>It was evident that even the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Nectar Dew Monastery couldn't remain seated.</p><p>In an instant, the eminent cultivators of various sects disregarded Jin Wudai's attempts to dissuade them and departed.</p><p>The journey to the Southern Prefecture was long. Even with their high cultivation and flying at full speed, they wouldn't arrive in a day or two, likely missing the first wave of treasure hunting. They could only hope for some complications to arise during the emergence of the lost legacy.</p><p>The Dharma Assembly, meticulously prepared by the Gold Jade Sect, was turning into a farce.</p><p>Jin Wudai's face was grim, but he could do nothing.</p><p>Finally, Jin Wudai summoned the sect elders, issued some instructions, and also set off for the Southern Prefecture with several experts.</p>
