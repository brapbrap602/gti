<h1>Chapter 1168: Surveillance</h1><p>Chapter 1168: Surveillance</p><p>After their discussion, the Serpent King said gravely, "It's certain that the rate of change is accelerating.  Perhaps within a century, we'll see the final outcome.  If nothing unexpected happens, everyone here will live to see that day. This might be the greatest opportunity for our generation of cultivators! This is an unprecedented transformation. We must prepare early, and at least within our demon clan, we must stand together to seize more treasures!"</p><p>Redtail Demon King rubbed his hands excitedly, "I agree with the Serpent King! There's no deep-seated hatred between us. If there are any conflicts, let's put them aside for now. Let the humans fight among themselves; the more chaotic, the better.  Ideally, they'll be shattered and never unite again!"</p><p>The various Demon Kings had different expressions, but none opposed.</p><p>The Feather Demon King looked around, "How the Purple Micro Palace will evolve in the future is anyone's guess. But to enter the Purple Micro Palace next time, we'll still need to use the human formation. Gathering you all here is precisely to discuss our next trip to the Purple Micro Palace."</p><p>While the Demon Kings discussed, Qin Sang rarely spoke, learning many secrets of the Purple Micro Palace from them.</p><p>Redtail Demon King felt strange and sent a voice transmission, "Friend Mingyue seems unenthusiastic.  Aren't you planning to go to the Purple Micro Palace?"</p><p>"I've heard that the Purple Micro Palace has been plundered again and again, and I know nothing about it. I'm afraid it will be difficult to find any treasures, so I'm not very interested. I'll ask my master for advice before making a decision.  I've only recently formed my Nascent Soul, and the most important thing now is to consolidate my cultivation and refine my abilities."</p><p>Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Soon, the Demon Kings agreed on a simple plan, with further adjustments to be made as needed.</p><p>Then, finally, a Demon King asked about the military situation, Qin Sang's main concern.</p><p>"The Sinful God Palace and the Purple Micro Palace are connected. Since we've detected changes in the Purple Micro Palace's celestial array, the Abyss of Sin must have noticed as well. Will they, like last time, temporarily retreat, recover their strength, and then fight again after the Purple Micro Palace trip?"</p><p>The Feather Demon King nodded, "That's the second thing we need to discuss. Not long ago, we received a message from the humans; they have similar speculations, but they are more vigilant."</p><p>"Oh? What do you mean?"</p><p>The Demon Kings were very curious.</p><p>"Actually, you've all received bits and pieces of information and must have sensed it already.  The Abyss of Sin's offensive this time is rather strange. Since the beginning of the war, they've been aggressive, seemingly launching a full-scale attack, but their momentum is far less than last time. The Skywalk Alliance lost a few cities and then settled down, and things have dragged on for several years."</p><p>The Feather Demon King tapped his fingers on the armrest, "Master Zhenyi worries that the Abyss of Sin is trying to lull the Two Realms Alliance into a false sense of security. If the Alliance relaxes its guard, a sudden change could catch them off guard, especially on the eve of the Purple Micro Palace's appearance. However, I guess the Two Realms Alliance may be unwilling to continue being beaten and has other plans.  This kind of war is also a huge burden on the Abyss of Sin. Is the Abyss of Sin's foundation truly unfathomable, or is it just a bluff?"</p><p>"So, Master Zhenyi wants to take the initiative?"</p><p>The Demon Kings looked at each other. One of them sneered, "If it weren't for the agreement made by our ancestors, we wouldn't lend them a single soldier!  He's asking for more demon soldiers, wanting us to personally participate?"</p><p>The Feather Demon King flicked his finger, sending out a beam of light, "These are the conditions proposed by the humans.  You might as well take a look first. At the front line, you only need to control the city's protective array and command the demon soldiers. If the situation turns unfavorable, you can retreat in time.  If there are other arrangements later, you can negotiate with the humans yourselves and then decide whether to participate…"</p><p>Then, the Feather Demon King added, "I won't beat around the bush in front of you all. I still hope that the Two Realms Alliance can hold back the Abyss of Sin. I don't know if it's just my feeling, but in recent years, I've met several Nascent Soul cultivators from the Abyss of Sin, especially Elder Ye.  They give me an increasingly uncomfortable feeling. This sinister and eerie aura isn't even present in Elder Tongyou, who has mastered demonic arts."</p><p>The Serpent King stated his position directly, "I have similar thoughts. If the Abyss of Sin swallows the Little Cold Domain, it'll be difficult to abide by the ancestral agreement as before. After this meeting, I'll go there myself."</p><p>The beam of light circled the hall.</p><p>After reading the conditions, the opposition weakened.</p><p>The compensation offered by the humans was indeed quite generous. More importantly, they only needed to participate in defending the city, greatly reducing the danger. Even if they lost the battle, it shouldn't be difficult for transformed demon kings to escape in advance.</p><p>For a time, the hall fell silent as the Demon Kings considered the gains and losses.</p><p>Some demon kings agreed, others refused.  Qin Sang was among those who agreed to help.</p><p>He had intended to go to the front lines anyway.  Being human, and having many relatives and friends in Xiao Han region, he felt obligated to contribute. With his escape techniques, even if he encountered danger, survival wouldn't be difficult. If truly defeated, there was nothing he could do but become a fugitive, fleeing elsewhere.</p><p>Disguising himself as a demon king participating in the city defense would also bring rewards.  Qin Sang had his eye on a rare type of wood called Jin Chen wood.  His ebony sword didn't need to absorb other woods for now. He wanted to prepare a second spirit sword; the treasures he had acquired previously weren't suitable. Qin Sang planned to gather materials himself and refine it personally, improving his craft and preparing for the future subjugation of the Nan Ming Li fire.</p><p>A spirit sword made of wood would be ideal, and a wood-based spirit sword would be the most suitable. Jin Chen wood is incredibly hard; when refined into a treasure, it adds a sharpness that makes it a good choice.</p><p>After agreeing on these two important matters, the feathered demon king brought up a few minor issues, and soon the meeting drew to a close.  Finally, the demon kings took the opportunity to hold a small trading fair.</p><p>Qin Sang had only recently advanced in cultivation, and his wealth was far less than these demon kings, so he could only drool over the treasures.  Most of what he possessed was demon slaying pills and demon bones—things he'd rather not explain in front of so many demon kings.</p><p>After the trade, the demon kings dispersed. Qin Sang also prepared to leave Wan Yao City and head south.  The Red-tailed Demon King bid farewell to Qin Sang, agreeing to meet again later. He explicitly refused to participate in the war; in his words, no treasure was worth fighting for an outsider.</p><p>Returning to his palace, Qin Sang called White Crane and Fatty Chicken, bought some things in Wan Yao City, and left directly. Shortly after leaving the city,  Qin Sang and the two birds were flying when a glint appeared in his eyes. He suddenly stopped, turning to look behind him. The two demons stopped and looked back.  They weren't far from Wan Yao City, only a few mountain ranges away.  The mountains were quiet; no other figures were visible.</p><p>"Master, what's wrong?" Fatty Chicken felt something was amiss and cautiously approached.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the area, settling on a particular peak. He coldly snorted and called out, "Fellow Daoist, following this king for so long shouldn't be a coincidence, should it?"</p>
