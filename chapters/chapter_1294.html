<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1286: Seeing Through</p><p>The earthen puppet's strike pierced through empty air.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that these puppets were different from the ones before—they seemed to be some kind of sword puppets.</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi let out a soft exclamation, slightly surprised by Qin Sang's swift reaction.</p><p>However, the deadly trap she had meticulously laid out wasn't so easily avoided. With a swift motion, she formed a peculiar sword seal, and the four earthen puppets shattered simultaneously, transforming into a storm of ten thousand swords!</p><p>At that moment, Immortal Qiu Zhi suddenly sensed a terrifying aura above her. Her delicate brows furrowed, and a sense of foreboding surged within her.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A deafening thunderclap echoed through the air.</p><p>It was Qin Sang's *Art of Thunder Summoning*.</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi recalled that Qin Sang possessed a formidable thunder technique and dared not underestimate him. She shot him a hateful glare but had no choice but to change her incantation. The earthen puppets around her flew to her head, forming a thick stone wall.</p><p>*Crack... crack...*</p><p>In an instant, the puppets merged into a solid mass, creating a heavy stone barrier.</p><p>The next moment, a bolt of heavenly thunder descended, striking the stone wall with immense force.</p><p>A thunderous boom resounded as the stone wall trembled violently, cracks spreading across its surface, and debris scattering everywhere.</p><p>The stone wall then split apart, and the residual thunderbolt mercilessly pierced through, striking the ground below—but it too hit nothing but empty air.</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi reappeared a hundred zhang away, unharmed but somewhat disheveled from her hasty retreat. She summoned her puppets back, only to find that several of them had been completely shattered and were beyond repair.</p><p>In her heart, her estimation of Qin Sang rose yet again.</p><p>His swordsmanship, thunder techniques, and evasion skills were all capable of threatening her. This man was not merely a cultivator reliant on external tools. Even without his demonic flames, his strength was among the top in the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>The brief exchange had been perilous.</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi was forced to retreat to protect herself, while Qin Sang seized the opportunity to escape danger.</p><p>But he did not stop there. Taking advantage of the damage to her puppets, Qin Sang immediately controlled his ebony sword to launch another fierce assault. Then, with a flash of lightning, he lunged toward Immortal Qiu Zhi.</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi cursed inwardly. Her sneak attack had failed, and now Qin Sang had seized the initiative. She hastily summoned her Xuanhuang Greatsword and retreated, simultaneously calling her puppets to block Qin Sang.</p><p>In mid-air, the two flying swords clashed, forming a chaotic ball of light, making it impossible to distinguish their movements. Only the clashing of metal could be heard from within.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang, relying solely on his fists, sent several damaged puppets flying and rapidly closed the distance.</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi's expression changed. No wonder this man could disguise himself as a demon king without being detected—his physical body was as strong as a demon beast's!</p><p>With a sudden flick of her arm, two white water sleeves shot out like agile white snakes. These were no ordinary sleeves—they were a magical treasure.</p><p>At that moment, a flush of red suddenly appeared on Immortal Qiu Zhi's face, and she angrily shouted, "Shameless!"</p><p>She quickly used her water sleeves to cover her face and retreated further, tossing out a piece of green jade.</p><p>As soon as the jade appeared, it emitted a suction force, drawing in some invisible substance from the air. In an instant, the jade turned gray and lost its power.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The jade fell to the ground, shattering into several pieces, now nothing more than ordinary stone.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly sighed in regret. His approach had been a feint. Immortal Qiu Zhi had only lost a single move and was far from being exhausted. She still had plenty of trump cards left, and who knew what other treasures she might possess.</p><p>No matter how strong his physical body was, it had its limits. Qin Sang had no intention of using his body to block magical treasures.</p><p>His true killing move was the aphrodisiac poison, followed by the demonic flames.</p><p>After taking Yue Sanren's belongings, Qin Sang discovered that the floral fan was Yue Sanren's life-bound treasure. While he couldn't fully control it yet, he could extract the aphrodisiac poison stored within.</p><p>This poison had been painstakingly refined by Yue Sanren, being colorless, odorless, and nearly impossible to guard against. Unfortunately, Yue Sanren had perished too quickly, and the poison had been ineffective against Qin Sang's demonic flames.</p><p>To deal with Immortal Qiu Zhi, Qin Sang had decided to use all the aphrodisiac poison he had extracted, secretly releasing it. However, Immortal Qiu Zhi possessed an anti-poison treasure, rendering his plan ineffective.</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi quickly suppressed the flush on her face, gritting her teeth in anger. Though unharmed, she was still furious. With a flick of her water sleeves, she launched a counterattack.</p><p>To her surprise, Qin Sang, who had seemingly gained the upper hand, suddenly sheathed his sword and retreated. Before she could react, he had already fled far away.</p><p>On the battlefield, fleeing mid-fight!</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi was momentarily stunned. Qin Sang's actions were too bizarre. She suspected a trap but still locked onto him with her spiritual sense, preparing to give chase.</p><p>At that moment, ripples appeared in the water in the distance, and two figures emerged from either side. They glanced in the direction Qin Sang had fled and snorted, "That brat escaped quickly!"</p><p>"Brother Shan! Brother Song! When did you two arrive?"</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi was both shocked and delighted, her figure pausing mid-air.</p><p>These two were renowned experts from the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Brother Shan's cultivation was only slightly weaker than Immortal Qiu Zhi's.</p><p>Brother Song was a step below, but his mastery of the Divine Wood Blade was extraordinary, allowing him to challenge opponents above his level. He had personally participated in the Blood Pool Battle, assisting Jiang Chenzi and others in controlling the Banner Gate Formation, though he hadn't been able to join the main battle.</p><p>These two had not been at Twin Mirror Mountain originally but had been dispatched to provide support.</p><p>They had approached stealthily, intending to ambush Qin Sang. To avoid detection, they hadn't informed Immortal Qiu Zhi.</p><p>Even Immortal Qiu Zhi hadn't noticed their presence, yet Qin Sang had seen through their plan.</p><p>Qin Sang's sudden retreat had caught them off guard, forcing them to abandon their pursuit.</p><p>Brother Song narrowed his eyes as he gazed in the direction Qin Sang had disappeared. "He didn't even use his Demonic Flame Banner, clearly holding back. Even if we had surrounded him, we might not have been able to stop him."</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi recalled her Xuanhuang Greatsword and added, "His spiritual perception is far sharper than most. Earlier, he even detected my sword puppets hidden underground. Elder Ye once said he was skilled in restriction techniques, but in my opinion, it's more likely he possesses some powerful detection method—perhaps a spiritual sense secret art or a divine eye technique..."</p><p>"Your sword puppets were disguised as rocks, lifeless and without any fluctuations. He could still detect them?"</p><p>Brother Shan was startled. "Immortal, you've always had a keen eye for people. It seems we'll have to guard against him in this regard from now on."</p><p>After a pause, Brother Shan couldn't help but sigh, "What a troublesome fellow!"</p><p>"Indeed, he's difficult to deal with. Not only are his techniques and treasures top-tier, but his physical strength is also the strongest I've ever seen. He must have mastered some kind of body-refining technique..."</p><p>Immortal Qiu Zhi continued to reveal her observations, nearly exposing all of Qin Sang's hidden cards.</p><p>Humans lack the powerful bloodlines of demon beasts, and in this era, the path of body refinement is incredibly difficult.</p><p>Brothers Shan and Song felt a sense of helplessness, wondering how such a monster had emerged from the Cold Domain.</p><p>After a brief exchange, Immortal Qiu Zhi said lightly, "With the two of you here, Twin Mirror Mountain is secure. I'll return to oversee the formation. Please stay within the formation and intercept the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two Realms Alliance. Seize the opportunity to break through the Xun Wind Formation!"</p><p>The two exchanged glances and quickly stopped her. "Immortal, you may not know this, but Elder Ye and Senior Cang Hong have already ordered a retreat. We were sent here to assist you in withdrawing from Twin Mirror Mountain!"</p>
