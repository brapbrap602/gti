<h1>Chapter 969: Breaking the Seal</h1><p>Chapter 969: Breaking the Seal</p><p>Longling ignited without a flame.</p><p>From afar, it resembled a phoenix reborn from ashes.</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng spread her wings, flying towards the Immortal Seal, and cast down Longling.</p><p>A torrent of fire fell from the sky.</p><p>Like a setting sun, it sank into the smoky clouds.</p><p>Longling struck the Immortal Seal, instantly provoking a violent counterattack.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A single stone stirred up a thousand waves.</p><p>Fire and smoke clashed, a powerful wave erupting instantly.  The clouds shook, attempting to repel Longling, and the earth trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang steadied himself, staring in shock at the astonishing sight within the Immortal Seal—Queen Jiu Feng was attacking the Seal!</p><p>That Longling, whatever it was, did not vanish under the Seal's counterattack. It remained dazzling, like a blazing sun, slowly piercing the smoky clouds, delving ever deeper.</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng moved faster, countless runes flowing out like water, urging Longling into the clouds.</p><p>The Immortal Seal's counterattack intensified. Not only Longling, but even the Phoenix Banner Formation was under assault.</p><p>The formation sealed this space, suppressing the strange phenomena. Initially, this was easy, but as the clash between Longling and the Immortal Seal grew fiercer, the formation began to show signs of instability.</p><p>Ripples appeared in the void.  The previously hidden phoenix phantoms flickered into view, especially where the impact was strongest, showing signs of disintegration. It was unclear how long the Phoenix Banner Formation could hold.</p><p>It seemed the confrontation between Longling and the Immortal Seal wouldn't end quickly.</p><p>Longling disappeared into the deep clouds.</p><p>From the outside, only the fiery glow could be faintly seen.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly awakened the Sky Eye Butterfly. He vaguely saw, through layers of clouds, Longling slowly descending. The main body was unseen, but the phoenix image on its surface grew increasingly solid.  Strange fluctuations appeared around the ethereal phoenix, fluctuations that could penetrate the Immortal Seal, traversing it with wondrous ease.</p><p>At that moment, the Immortal Seal, which had been unable to stop Longling's advance, seemed to realize that Queen Jiu Feng was the master of Longling.  The smoky clouds surged like a raging ocean, transforming into beams of light that erupted outwards.</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng, closest to the Seal, was the first to be hit.</p><p>Her expression changed slightly, and she let out a sharp cry, her aura surging.</p><p>Simultaneously, Longling erupted in a blazing inferno, at the critical moment dispersing the beams of light and forming a fiery barrier, suppressing the Seal’s counterattack.</p><p>If not for the Phoenix Banner Formation, such a commotion would have already alerted the cultivators in the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>The aftershocks of the collision still radiated outwards.</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng weaved through the aftershocks, but the Phoenix Banner Formation bore the brunt of the impact.</p><p>A series of booming sounds echoed.</p><p>The Phoenix Banner trembled violently, swaying as if about to collapse.</p><p>Without waiting for Queen Jiu Feng's orders, Caiyi Xianzi and the other demons knew it was their turn.  They placed their hands on the Phoenix Banner, using their full power to activate secret techniques and stabilize the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang did the same, but he held back, not giving his all.</p><p>He was waiting.</p><p>If possible, he would not hesitate to act if the phenomenon attracted the attention of Yuan Ying stage cultivators.</p><p>But this opportunity was difficult to seize.</p><p>Yuan Ying stage cultivators were not nearby. By the time they discovered the anomaly and arrived, Qin Sang would already be dead at the hands of the demons, and even if Queen Jiu Feng were eventually hunted down, it would not benefit him in the slightest.</p><p>With the demons' support, the Phoenix Banner Formation, though seemingly on the verge of collapse, was considerably more stable than before.</p><p>Sensing the situation had stabilized, Queen Jiu Feng, without looking back, focused on manipulating Longling.</p><p>By now, Longling had sunk deep into the smoky clouds.  The inside of the Immortal Seal was shrouded in chaos, and the Sky Eye Butterfly could see nothing, so Qin Sang had to recall it.</p><p>Unable to see inside the Immortal Seal made it harder for Qin Sang to judge the timing, and he grew increasingly anxious.  He was mainly unsure of Queen Jiu Feng's true intentions, leaving him unable to act.</p><p>As time passed, Longling continued to break through the Immortal Seal.</p><p>The Seal's counterattack was fierce, but it was still suppressed by Longling, causing the demons to marvel at the unknown treasure that could subdue even the Immortal Seal.</p><p>Shortly after, Queen Jiu Feng suddenly changed her hand seals, spitting out a stream of red light that merged with Longling. Her eyes fixed on the Immortal Seal, she roared.</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The smoky clouds suddenly surged wildly, and the counterattack instantly sent Queen Jiu Feng flying.  Her feathers shattered, as if scorched by flames, leaving her in a sorry state.</p><p>Ignoring her injuries, she continued to stare intently at the Immortal Seal.</p><p>At that moment, Chang Ling's fiery feather burned out, successfully breaking the celestial barrier and falling into a mysterious area shrouded in darkness below.  Chang Ling, like the last rays of the setting sun, plunged rapidly into the darkness, instantly losing its brilliance and disappearing.</p><p>Outside the celestial barrier:</p><p>Facing the barrier's counterattack, the Fengqi Formation finally couldn't hold.  Unstabilized Fengqi flags snapped, losing their spiritual essence, and instantly turned to dust under the assault.  It was clear the formation was about to break, unable to suppress the anomaly.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang finally reacted, rapidly changing hand seals.  She successively detonated the Fengqi flags, exhausting the formation's remaining power, then said in a deep voice, "Retreat!"</p><p>"Leaving already?"</p><p>Cai Yi Xianzi and the other demons were astonished. They had expected Jiu Feng Wang, having broken the barrier, to enter the inner chamber or retrieve some treasure.  Instead, she only sent in the feather and was now withdrawing.  The demons couldn't guess her intentions.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang issued an unquestionable order and retreated.  At that moment, a chain reaction seemed to occur within the barrier, with waves of powerful shocks rippling outwards, even triggering distant parts of the barrier.  The terrifying fluctuations sent chills down their spines.</p><p>The demons, not daring to delay, scrambled to retreat, following Jiu Feng Wang.</p><p>Not far from the barrier, a tremendous roar erupted behind them.  The demons looked back in alarm, seeing a brilliant ray of light burst through the shattered Fengqi Formation and shoot skyward.  This pillar of light was clearly visible throughout the entire Qisha Hall.</p><p>The anomaly showed no sign of stopping; instead, it intensified.  In the distance, figures emerged from the mountains, their faces showing surprise and confusion as they gazed at the light column, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>Immediately afterward, several streaks of light, carrying powerful auras, appeared from the depths of the mountains and sped towards them at incredible speed.  The Yuan Ying Masters had indeed been alerted.</p><p>Faced with so many Yuan Ying cultivators, Jiu Feng Wang's expression turned serious.  She dared not be careless.  Returning to human form, she concealed the demons' presence and aura, then skirted around the approaching cultivators, moving stealthily through the mountains.</p><p>"Ninth Aunt, where are we going now?"</p><p>Cai Yi Xianzi couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Away from Qisha Hall!"</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang replied calmly.</p><p>Hearing this, the demons were puzzled.  Jiu Feng Wang had gone to great lengths, only to visit a ruined cave and send a feather into the inner chamber?</p><p>She offered no explanation, and the demons dared not question her, silently following Jiu Feng Wang back to Hua Xian Lake. Jiu Feng Wang did not possess a jade talisman.  Those with higher cultivation suffered greater impact when traversing the celestial array. Qin Sang's talismans couldn't be used by Jiu Feng Wang; she had to use the same method as before to leave Qisha Hall.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>It's getting late.</p><p>Weekends are busier with chores than work.</p><p>There's an early morning meeting on Monday. I'll try to write the next chapter during my lunch break tomorrow and see if I can adjust my schedule.</p>
