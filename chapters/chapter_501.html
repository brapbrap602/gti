<h1>Chapter 494  A Long Time Coming</h1><p>Chapter 494  A Long Time Coming</p><p>Perhaps the sacrifice of the three corpse demons worked.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised to find that the resistance of Jiupao Daoren began to weaken, the demonic energy showing signs of dissipation.  Qin Sang finally caught a glimpse of Jiupao Daoren's true form.</p><p>His condition was even worse than that of Feitian Yecha; his breath was weak, and he showed clear signs of exhaustion in the face of the relentless attacks of Qin Sang and Feitian Yecha. His defeat was inevitable.</p><p>But before Qin Sang could breathe a sigh of relief, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Jiupao Daoren roared, and the vast demonic energy suddenly collapsed inward at an alarming speed. In the center of the demonic energy, a black whirlwind rapidly formed, brewing a terrifying storm.</p><p>The whirlwind swept up the surging demonic energy, and Qin Sang sensed an incredibly violent aura within it, its power immensely destructive.</p><p>Even on the outer edges of the battlefield, Qin Sang felt a shudder, and a sense of unease rose in his heart; he realized this must be Jiupao Daoren's final, desperate gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to order Feitian Yecha to attack fiercely.</p><p>But he found that Feitian Yecha, without needing his urging, charged into the storm without hesitation.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Terrifying booms echoed from within the storm.</p><p>The valley caved in, rocks tumbled down.</p><p>A look of surprise appeared in Qin Sang's eyes. At this critical moment, the corpse pill power within Feitian Yecha erupted, and it somehow managed to withstand the terrifying storm.</p><p>It stood firm within the demonic storm like a stabilizing anchor, forcefully suppressing Jiupao Daoren, giving him no opportunity to exploit. No matter how Jiupao Daoren struggled, he could not escape Feitian Yecha. His roars became increasingly frantic, even desperate.</p><p>While excited, Qin Sang also felt a pang of pain.</p><p>The price of Feitian Yecha's valiant display was its inability to dodge, forcing it to endure each of Jiupao Daoren's counterattacks.</p><p>The cost was immense.  Already severely injured, Feitian Yecha's condition worsened; there wasn't a single unscathed part of its body.  It had a deep, sunken handprint on its abdomen, almost piercing through it.</p><p>All four limbs showed varying degrees of damage.  Only because Feitian Yecha lacked consciousness, yet possessed an incredibly strong physique, was it able to persist under these circumstances and maintain remarkable combat effectiveness.</p><p>The power within its corpse pill was being continuously drawn, showing clear signs of depletion.</p><p>The corpse pill's glow dimmed, its operation sluggish.</p><p>Qin Sang had no idea what state Feitian Yecha would be in after this battle.</p><p>Even if it could recover, it would likely take a considerable amount of time.</p><p>But Qin Sang dared not allow Feitian Yecha to retreat; as long as he could obtain Jiupao Daoren's golden core, even if Feitian Yecha were destroyed here, it would be worth it!</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Jiupao Daoren suddenly let out a deafening roar.</p><p>It was like the last desperate cry of a trapped beast, filled with terrifying hatred, unlike any human voice.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, and he saw the demonic storm suddenly halt.</p><p>The next moment, it exploded!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>In an instant, the valley plunged into darkness, as if eternal night had descended.</p><p>The violent demonic energy surged in all directions. Qin Sang's mind was taut, his eyes fixed on the center of the battlefield, and he finally saw two figures blasted into the air.</p><p>Feitian Yecha crashed into a nearby mountain, embedding itself deep within the mountainside.</p><p>Without lingering on Feitian Yecha, Qin Sang immediately turned his attention to the other figure.</p><p>He saw Jiupao Daoren create a deep crater in the ground, then unexpectedly sprung out of it, stumbling and staggering towards escape.</p><p>“Not dead yet?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. Without waiting for Feitian Yecha, he immediately controlled the Ten Directions Yama Banner to intercept him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jiupao Daoren hadn't traveled far when his body suddenly stiffened, and he fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>He tried to crawl, but couldn’t get up, as if someone was vying for control of his body. His body spasmed uncontrollably.</p><p>Jiupao Daoren screamed in panic.</p><p>"What are you doing!"</p><p>"I am your master!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred at this sight.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Jiupao Daoren's abdomen suddenly burst open, his body splitting in two, blood and flesh flying everywhere. A radiant light shot out from his dantian; he had again abandoned his physical body, attempting to escape with his golden core.</p><p>But that wasn't the end.  The moment his golden core emerged, a ghostly apparition suddenly surged from the severed parts of his body, desperately grappling and tearing at Jiupao Daoren's primordial spirit, pulling at his golden core.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed in front of him, extending a hand to beckon.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Inferno engulfed the golden core of Daoist Jiupao.</p><p>Suddenly, a chilling scream pierced the demonic flames.</p><p>"Who are you!  I have no quarrel with you, why kill me?!"</p><p>Jiupao, his body torn apart by Ji Wu, was left only as a remnant soul, unable even to self-destruct his golden core, still screaming in anguish.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him coldly, "Do you remember the countless wronged souls beneath Yin Sha Abyss? They've been waiting for you in the underworld. You've lived too long!"</p><p>With a cold snort, Qin Sang made a grasping motion. The Nine Netherworld Inferno completely consumed Jiupao's remaining soul.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>With these two sounds, the valley finally fell silent.  But the beauty was gone, leaving only ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang put away her magical treasures and the Ten Directions Yama Formation, feeling a wave of weakness wash over her.  Forcing herself to remain alert, she took two pills and looked at the ground.  Beside Jiupao's golden core lay a dark iron ring.</p><p>The ring was similar in shape and size to a finger ring, very inconspicuous, looking like it was made from ordinary black iron, even showing some rust.</p><p>A cursory scan with her spiritual sense revealed nothing remarkable; it was easy to overlook.</p><p>However, having survived the battle and kept on Jiupao's person even in his flight, the ring was surely more than it appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang approached, about to kneel to examine it, when she felt a faint gaze upon her.  Looking up, she found Ji Wu still alive.</p><p>His body was severed in two, blood almost drained, staining the ground a gruesome red.  His breath was shallow, yet he strained to keep his eyes open, fixed on Qin Sang, clinging to life through sheer will.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang notice him, a plea flickered in Ji Wu's eyes; his lips moved slightly, but he lacked the strength to speak. His gaze was desperate.</p><p>After a moment of shared gaze, Qin Sang understood, sighing softly, "Rest easy. I have no quarrel with Cold Mountain City, and I will not harm the Ji family."</p><p>The light in Ji Wu's eyes faded rapidly, and he closed his eyes, finally passing away.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Ji Wu's corpse, lost in thought, standing there for a while before kneeling to examine her spoils of war.</p><p>Golden cores and demon cores are very different. Both are beautiful, but lack the chilling aura of a demon core.</p><p>However, the aura of a Core Formation stage expert remained.  And since Jiupao had just died, his golden core glowed brilliantly, full of spiritual energy, captivating.</p>
