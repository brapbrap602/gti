<h1>Chapter 847: True Demonic Qi</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist Yue, heading north directly like this, we should be nearing Senior Wu’s grounds, shouldn't we? This large island sits at the northernmost edge of the cultivator territories, a place only someone with Senior Wu’s immense cultivation could hold.  Now that even Senior Wu has retreated to Desolate Island, further north is a savage wilderness rarely tread by cultivators. It's said powerful demon clans reside there. Is Fellow Daoist Yue's acquaintance trapped in such a place?”</p><p>The group flew swiftly over the sea.</p><p>Kong Yun gazed at the vast ocean to the north, his expression grave, questioning Yue Xiangu.</p><p>After setting off, they traveled day and night.</p><p>Yue Xiangu led them northward, unexpectedly about to leave the former boundaries of human territory with no intention of stopping, seemingly intending to take them into the demon lands.</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>Yue Xiangu nodded, frankly stating, “My acquaintance cultivates a unique technique requiring a specific environment, or their progress would be exceedingly slow. After a long search, they were fortunate to find a suitable location in the Demon Sea and established a cave dwelling to continue their cultivation. We agreed I would retrieve them upon completion of their training.  Unexpectedly, the Demon Sea has become perilous, and I fear I alone cannot protect them.  Were it not for this, how could I bear to offer such valuable treasures, inviting fellow Daoists to venture forth?”</p><p>Hearing Yue Xiangu’s explanation, Qin Sang and the others found it difficult to object. After all, the reward offered by Yue Xiangu was substantial, justifying their involvement.</p><p>“Yue Xiangu offered so many treasures just to find powerful protectors for this person. This individual must be extremely important to her…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Yue Xiangu’s snow-white hair, secretly speculating if it was her descendant, or perhaps a highly regarded disciple.</p><p>They journeyed in silence.</p><p>Three days later, they passed Senior Wu's grounds, which, like other large islands, had been overrun by demonic beasts and lay in ruins.</p><p>They proceeded cautiously, careful not to alert any demonic beasts.</p><p>All four were powerful cultivators, none lagging behind, their cooperation seamless.  Encountering demonic beasts, they either swiftly eliminated them or used coordinated maneuvers to conceal their presence, never once revealing a flaw.</p><p>Continuing north from Senior Wu’s grounds, they entered the demon territories. Demonic beasts were frequently encountered, forcing them to slow their pace. It took over a month to reach their destination.</p><p>“My acquaintance’s cave is on an island several dozen miles ahead.  This island is vast, and originally housed the nests of several powerful demons. I’m uncertain if they have been summoned to Desolate Island.  Protecting my acquaintance now falls to you, fellow Daoists.”</p><p>Yue Xiangu’s expression turned solemn. She cupped her hands towards the other three, then looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang affirmed he would do his utmost.</p><p>The four found a nearby reef to rest and adjust their condition.</p><p>Fortune favored them. The night was moonless and starless, pitch black.  Each employing their own methods to conceal their presence, they silently approached the island.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and activated his Heavenly Eye, allowing him to clearly see the surrounding scene even in the darkest night.  Soon, a massive dark shape appeared before them.</p><p>The edge of the island was still out of sight.  Its size was likely comparable to Desolate Island, a rare colossal landmass.</p><p>Before even landing, they could hear the cries of birds and the roars of beasts. The four paused momentarily before flying onto the island, quickly concealing themselves within a dense forest.</p><p>Yue Xiangu took out a map, pointing to a specific location. “The destination is here.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely, noting the marked location was not at the island's center. They could reach it by dawn.  Confirming their direction, the group set off without delay.</p><p>As they hurried through the dense forest, they sensed the presence of a demonic beast every short distance. Deep within the forest, a powerful demonic aura lingered.</p><p>With so many demonic beasts at the island's periphery, there were surely powerful demon nests deeper within.</p><p>Having come to rescue someone, they decided to spare these demonic beasts.</p><p>Traversing mountains and valleys, the terrain grew increasingly treacherous.</p><p>The island's mountains rose and fell in unbroken chains, but this posed no obstacle for them.</p><p>As the eastern sky began to lighten, they arrived at a deep valley. Yue Xiangu’s acquaintance's cave was hidden within.</p><p>A thick fog filled the valley floor, slowly rising. The valley was surrounded by towering mountains, trapping the fog within.  Strangely, the fog was not white, but tinged with faint black streaks, giving it a greyish-white appearance and an eerie coldness.</p><p>Even with their high cultivation levels, they were forced to circulate their spiritual energy to ward off the chill.</p><p>Seeing this, the smile that had appeared on Yue Xiangu's face upon their safe arrival vanished.  She urgently said, “Could we be too late? The valley’s restrictions… Fellow Daoists, please keep watch from above. I’ll descend and check if my acquaintance is still there.”</p><p>With that, Yue Xiangu tapped her foot, her white robe flowing around her as she disappeared before their eyes.</p><p>Ripples spread through the fog, quickly settling.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two exchanged glances, spreading out a short distance, each vigilant in their own direction.</p><p>Standing at the valley's edge, the chill of the fog intensified, piercing to the bone.</p><p>Qin Sang cupped a handful of fog, using his spiritual energy to purify it. What remained was a hair-thin wisp of black smoke.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation. As he was about to examine the smoke closely, he suddenly heard Zhu Shanzong's voice. “Fellow Daoist, have you noticed as well?  The fog seems to be infused with demonic qi!”</p><p>“Is it truly demonic qi?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, asking doubtfully, “I've encountered demonic cultivators before, and this seems different?”</p><p>Zhu Shanzong nodded. “Indeed, it is different. This might be ancient True Demonic Qi!”</p><p>“Correct,” Kong Yun added. “I have a few acquaintances in the demonic path and have perused some of their scriptures. These black wisps closely resemble descriptions of ancient True Demonic Qi.  Places where True Demonic Qi exists in the current cultivation world are extremely rare and only form under unique circumstances. The demonic qi cultivated by demonic cultivators is naturally far inferior to ancient True Demonic Qi.  The valley bottom is clearly an area saturated with True Demonic Qi, a demonic land. For Yue Xiangu’s acquaintance to cultivate using True Demonic Qi, they are no ordinary individual.”</p><p>Zhu Shanzong asked in puzzlement, “I don’t recall hearing of any connection between Yue Xiangu and the demonic path.”</p><p>Kong Yun chuckled. “I’m also unaware.  Perhaps Fellow Daoist could inquire with Yue Xiangu.”</p><p>Zhu Shanzong smiled without responding.</p><p>After their brief exchange, silence returned to the valley’s edge.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the black wisp of smoke, his mind recalling a past event.</p><p>After meeting Madam Liu, he had questioned her in detail about the events at the Seven Kill Hall when Xiang Yi activated the ancient divine platform, seeking to uncover the secrets of the East Pole Alliance and West Gloom Alliance.</p><p>He had obtained a strange talisman after killing the young man from the West Gloom Alliance, a talisman whose purpose he still couldn't decipher.</p><p>According to Madam Liu, after the ancient divine platform was activated, Xiang Yi used a secret talisman to suppress the thunder chains. The black dragon sealed within the talisman seemed to be formed from incredibly pure ancient True Demonic Qi.</p><p>The three great merchant alliances remained separate from both the righteous and demonic paths. Yet, two Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators within the East Pole Alliance were connected to True Demonic Qi.</p>
