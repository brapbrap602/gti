<h1>Chapter 593: Path of Swords</h1><p>After the sword energy dissipated, a faint glow also faded on the cliff face, easily overlooked if one wasn't paying close attention.</p><p>Before this glow appeared, the cliff showed no abnormalities, and no trace of a restriction or spirit array could be felt.</p><p>But when Qin Sang switched to the Cold Gold Sword and unleashed ordinary sword energyâ€¦</p><p>As the sword energy was about to fall, it was blocked by a strange force. The sword energy was impacted, rapidly dissipating.  Even the faintest remaining energy, landing lightly on the cliff, failed to leave a mark.</p><p>However, this time, no glow appeared on the stone wall.</p><p>As Granny Jing had said, only sword energy cultivated through the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*  and imbued with the unique killing intent of the killing talismans could activate the sword restriction here and open the way.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated no longer, immediately urging his Ebony Sword to strike again.</p><p>As wave after wave of sword energy was absorbed by the cliff, the glow on the cliff face became increasingly brighter.</p><p>After another burst of sword energy vanished into the cliff, Qin Sang suddenly felt the mountain peak tremble slightly beneath his feet. This time, the glow on the cliff didn't disappear.</p><p>The entire cliff shone with a faint light, within which a door materialized, its interior shrouded in darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. He dashed to the door.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner was useless now. Qin Sang focused on activating the Ebony Sword, circling it around his body for protection.</p><p>Beyond the door was a majestic ancient hall, dozens of feet high, its deepest parts plunged into darkness, its end unseen.</p><p>Considering this was near the mountaintop, where the peak was slender, it was impossible for such a large hall to exist.  It was unclear what secret techniques were used in its construction.</p><p>Most strangely, the floor of the ancient hall was filled with all sorts of swords!</p><p>These were not spirit swords, but stone swords carved from stone, each with a different shape. Some were exceptionally large and heavy as mountains; others were as thin as a cicada's wing. Not a single one was alike.</p><p>They were planted upside down in the ground, revealing half their length, practically filling the entire hall.</p><p>Amidst the thousands of stone swords, a path just wide enough for one person ran straight into the depths of the ancient hall.</p><p>This was a Path of Swords!</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the door, his expression grave. These stone swords didn't appear to be spirit swords, just ordinary stones, yet he could sense the chaotic sword intent filling the hall.</p><p>This sword intent was very familiar, originating from the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*.</p><p>The killing talisman on the Ebony Sword trembled, as if joyful at encountering its kin.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the center of the hall.</p><p>There, it was pitch black, nothing visible.  Divine sense couldn't penetrate either; once it entered the hall, it would immediately be shredded by the omnipresent sword intent.</p><p>What place was this?</p><p>A trial path?</p><p>Qin Sang wondered. He knew some sword cultivation sects had similar trials, where elders left behind the essence of sword intent to guide their successors in comprehending the sword way and improving their swordsmanship.</p><p>Shao Hua Mountain also had such a place, called the Sword Tower, which Qin Sang had visited twice. However, the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* was too special, its effects not very pronounced; Qin Sang rarely went back afterward.</p><p>This sword intent was clearly different from that of Shao Hua Mountain's Sword Tower. Each strand possessed terrifying killing intent, truly worthy of its origin in the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*.</p><p>Those who cultivated the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* and dedicated themselves to the path of killing should gain some insight traversing this Path of Swords.</p><p>But Qin Sang only valued the technique's rapid cultivation speed and powerful abilities, relying on the Jade Buddha for protection during cultivation and treating it as a tool; he hadn't, like others, completely immersed himself in the path of killing.</p><p>He didn't know if he could gain any insight from the Path of Swords.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang urged the Ebony Sword, unleashing sword energy for protection, and stepped into the hall.</p><p>The next instant, the light abruptly dimmed.</p><p>In an instant, thousands of stone swords resonated; the hall echoed with the long cry of swords.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was also affected, its sword energy vibrating and humming.</p><p>In response to the Ebony Sword, the sword intent scattered in the air calmed down.</p><p>But the stone sword closest to Qin Sang vibrated even more violently.  Then, that stone sword flashed, and a strand of sword intent shot out, instantly reaching him.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected that such ordinary-looking stone swords could unleash sword intent, and this intent was exceptionally powerful, causing him a bit of heart palpitations.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was prepared. The Ebony Sword flashed before him, intercepting the sword intent precisely.  Its sword energy surged, clashing head-on.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>With a single collision, the Ebony Sword suddenly dimmed, its sword energy scattered.</p><p>However, a trace of the sword intent remained, bypassing the Ebony Sword and slashing toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly. His full-power strike had been insufficient; this sword intent was almost as powerful as an attack from a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>He hastily made a sword-controlling gesture, about to summon his sword for defense, but suddenly paused, sensing something. He chose to forgo retrieving his ebony sword, relying solely on his own strength to resist.</p><p>A sword intent, thin as a hair, lightly landed before Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang braced himself.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sword intent didn't leave a wound, but instead directly cut into Qin Sang's spiritual space, only to be easily dispelled by the jade Buddha's golden light.</p><p>"As I suspected!"</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly excited; he had vaguely guessed.</p><p>This place was similar to the sword tower of Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>This seemingly terrifying sword intent was merely the essence of swordsmanship sealed within the stone sword, not true sword energy. It only attacked the spiritual soul, aiming to deter disciples of insufficient cultivation.</p><p>This would likely be a trial ground where only Foundation Establishment stage cultivators could pass easily.</p><p>With his current cultivation, without the protection of the jade Buddha, he could only proceed cautiously, slowly deciphering each sword intent. Even if he succeeded, it was uncertain whether he could reach the inner sanctum of the ancient hall before it closed.</p><p>He recalled Granny Jing mentioning that cultivating the "Spiritual Soul Sword Cultivation Chapter" would greatly increase the chances of finding Elder Qingzhu's relics after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. It wasn't an empty statement after all.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only a soul-piercing sword intent, easily resisted with the jade Buddha.</p><p>For him, this sword path was a smooth road!</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't rely on the jade Buddha to barge in.</p><p>At the moment the ebony sword and sword intent collided, Qin Sang seemed to glimpse a bloody scene.  Before he could comprehend it fully, he was overwhelmed by the intensity of the sword intent.</p><p>Now, he considered that this scene must have been left by ancient masters. The sword intent contained their understanding of cultivation techniques, the way of the sword, and the art of killing. If he could see it a little longer, he would certainly gain something.</p><p>Qin Sang's understanding of cultivation techniques was far less profound than Elder Qingzhu's, who had painstakingly cultivated his skills. He might not immediately grasp anything.</p><p>But if he could remember it and ponder on it later, it should help his later cultivation and comprehension of the killing talismans.</p><p>Perhaps it could even speed up his inscription of the killing talismans!</p><p>There was no danger, so why not?</p><p>His entry into the ancient hall was very smooth, with no delays, leaving him ample time.</p><p>Qin Sang thought and acted, continuing to activate his ebony sword, striding forward.</p>
