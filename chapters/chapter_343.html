Chapter 336 Shi Hong


“You all met the Kuiyin Sect's requirements, breaking through to the sixth level of Qi Refinement. The Sect has given you your promised rewards.  I learned from Yue Wu that Qin, you were appointed as an outer sect manager, and that Shi Hong was taken in as Yue Wu's disciple. You both received important positions.


Tan Jie thought he might have overreacted and resumed his cultivation. However, the higher his cultivation became, the more uneasy he felt.  At the same time, we noticed more and more irregularities.


Qin, you never returned.  Everyone who went out with you disappeared without a trace!


Shi Hong was kept under increasingly strict surveillance by Yue Wu, losing her freedom!


Those senior brothers and sisters who broke through to the tenth level of Qi Refinement also vanished!


The entire Yin Sha Abyss was like a huge cage, and we were livestock raised within it. People died every day; corpses were thrown into the abyss!


Constantly!


Everything about the Kuiyin Sect was abnormal.


By then, Tan Jie and I had already considered escaping. We tried to contact Shi Hong, but she was heavily guarded, with no opportunity to do so.


This made us even more uneasy, and we tried countless times to escape, but we never had a chance.


Then a sudden change occurred. The Sect Master's attack on Yuanzhao Sect failed, and almost all of the Kuiyin Sect's experts were killed.


The remaining people scattered. Those guarding the Yin Sha Abyss fled or dispersed. Yue Wu also died.  Tan Jie and I escaped during the chaos. But when we went to find Shi Hong, we ran into Liang Yan.


He was not only controlling Shi Hong, but he wanted to control us as well.


Naturally, we wouldn't let him succeed. After a fierce battle, Tan Jie and I were severely injured and escaped, but Shi Hong remained in his grasp.


We fled south, returning to our hometown near You Mountain Market.


Because we didn't know how to contact you, we left a letter for you with the You Mountain Market gatekeeper.  The letter contained a coded message warning you about the Yanluo Banner's deception.


That person had a photographic memory.  If you return to You Mountain Market, you should be able to retrieve the letter…”


Tan Hao looked at Qin Sang questioningly.


“Letter?”


Qin Sang was startled and slowly shook his head.


He obtained the Nine Illusion Sky Orchid years ago and fled in a panic. He didn't dare to enter You Mountain Market when passing by, missing the chance to reunite with the Tan brothers.


Later, he joined Mount Shaohua, diligently cultivating without a moment's relaxation. He hasn't even gone back to Da Sui, let alone You Mountain Market.


“I was afraid that Kuiyin Sect remnants were active in You Mountain Market, so I didn't dare go back…Since you escaped, did Tan Jie abandon the Yanluo Banner and rebuild his cultivation?”


Tan Hao lowered his eyes, a hint of sadness flashing across them. His voice was unusually low. “He didn't have a chance to rebuild his cultivation… When we escaped from the Kuiyin Sect, we first encountered Liang Yan, and then we were pursued.  Tan Jie’s cultivation was high, so he had to rely on it. This resulted in very serious injuries he couldn't suppress the evil spirits in the Yanluo Banner, and he was attacked by the spirits. Fortunately, he had anticipated the Yanluo Banner's trickery and was prepared. He wasn't completely overtaken by the evil spirits, but his soul and body were both severely injured. There was no one in You Mountain Market who could heal him.  To find medicinal herbs to treat him, I came to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield…”


“The Tranquil Spirit Pill you bought in the secret market was for Tan Jie, wasn't it?”


Qin Sang suddenly realized. No wonder Tan Hao appeared healthy and didn't look injured.


“Tan Jie is healing in the cave? I would like to go with you, Brother Tan. If there's a way to cure Tan Jie, I will definitely help.”


“Thank you, Brother Qin.”


Tan Hao gratefully bowed, but there was little joy on his face.


Qin Sang pondered. Tan Hao hadn't been able to cure Tan Jie for so many years; his injuries must be very serious.


However, Tan Hao was only at the Qi Refinement stage and was an independent cultivator with limited capabilities. He had to exert all his effort to buy a single Tranquil Spirit Pill.


Although Qin Sang didn't have many spirit stones left, he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator and had the backing of Mount Shaohua.  He also had a good relationship with Yun Youzi, a disciple of the Taiyi Danzong. He would have more options than Tan Hao.


If he could cure Tan Jie, Qin Sang would certainly not hesitate to help.


“By the way, Shi Hong was taken away by Liang Yan? Have you seen her since then?”


Qin Sang remembered Shi Hong.  Of the few who entered the Kuiyin Sect together, only four of them survived. Now that he had met the Tan brothers, Shi Hong was still missing.


Tan Hao hesitated, then whispered, “Since we parted ways at the Kuiyin Sect, Shi Hong has been missing.  It wasn't until a few years ago that we unexpectedly reunited on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.”


Qin Sang exclaimed joyfully, "Shi Hong escaped Liang Yan? How is she now?"

Unexpectedly, Tan Hao sighed, "Shi Hong is still under Liang Yan's control. Luckily, Tan Jie warned her about the suspicious nature of the Yan Luo Banner.  She's kept her cultivation at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, pretending to be stuck at a bottleneck, and hasn't dared to break through."

"Liang Yan isn't dead?"

Qin Sang's heart sank.  The Kui Yin Sect was destroyed, its cultivators almost completely annihilated by the Yuan Zhao Sect.  She never imagined Liang Yan would survive.

Tan Hao nodded, his voice filled with hate.

"Not only did he survive, he actually prospered from the calamity. Shi Hong said that even while at Kui Yin Sect, Liang Yan claimed to be a direct disciple of Yue Wu.  When the sect fell, he seized Yue Wu's legacy.  While fleeing, he encountered a severely injured Foundation Establishment cultivator from Kui Yin Sect. This cultivator was skilled at deception, and Liang Yan gained his trust before ambushing and killing him.  With the belongings of two Foundation Establishment cultivators, plus his own considerable talent, he soon broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage.  Shi Hong mentioned several years ago he was nearing the mid-Foundation Establishment stage; we don't know if he's achieved it yet."

"Foundation Establishment?"

Qin Sang sighed inwardly, thinking of Liang Yan and their fellow disciples.  Liang Yan was talented, but if he'd stayed at Kui Yin Sect, he wouldn't have advanced so quickly. It just goes to show that everyone's path is different.

The great battle was a catastrophe for Kui Yin Sect, but a great opportunity for Liang Yan. He lost his sect's protection, yet gained the resources of two Foundation Establishment cultivators, making his cultivation resources far richer.

It was the same for me. If it weren't for that war, if I'd stayed at Kui Yin Sect, I would have broken through to the tenth level of Qi Condensation, but I would have died from the Yan Wang's Devouring.  I would certainly have been discovered. I would not only have lost my life, but the Jade Buddha would have fallen into someone else's hands, becoming a gift for someone else. I wouldn't be alive today.

Shi Hong's experience, however, is incredibly cruel, having cut short her immortal path.  She's a dual-spiritual root (gold and wood), a prodigy second only to those with celestial spiritual roots. In the entire cultivation world, she's undeniably a genius. Even without joining a sect, Shi Hong had a high chance of achieving Foundation Establishment on her own.  Instead, she fell into the clutches of a demonic sect, almost becoming the soul of a demonic artifact. Though she escaped, she's been trapped at the eighth level of Qi Condensation, unable to break through to this day.  It's truly lamentable.
