<h1>Chapter 1625  Láng Huán Jade Palace</h1><p>Qin Sang recalled the treasures he obtained from the suspected tomb of the Water Aspect Master: a mysterious ice disc and two spirit pills.</p><p>His Manifestation had refined the "Ice Soul Divine Light" with the help of the mysterious ice disc, and sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough, though he could only simply utilize the disc's power. Qin Sang believed that he had not yet unearthed this treasure's true potential.</p><p>The two spirit pills remained even more enigmatic, and were put aside for the time being. The mysterious ice disc had always been carried by his Manifestation.</p><p>The Manifestation retrieved the treasure.  Illusory scenes constantly shifted within the ice disc, flashing images of an ice palace every few breaths. A corner of the ice palace within his field of vision precisely matched a part of the image within the disc.</p><p>Qin Sang flew horizontally to another mountain peak, gaining a slightly clearer view.</p><p>Since the mysterious ice disc was a relic of the Water Aspect Master, it was certainly deeply connected to the Formless Immortal Sect. However, Qin Sang hadn't expected the ice palace's image to be a real place, and he wondered which came first, the ice palace or the disc.</p><p>"The Water Aspect Palace?"</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the ice palace was the location of the Formless Immortal Sect's Water Aspect lineage's inheritance.</p><p>Having discovered the Water Aspect lineage's inheritance, he couldn't afford to miss it. His Manifestation cultivated ice-based cultivation methods, and with luck, might obtain further opportunities within the ice palace.</p><p>At the very least, he needed to ascertain the purpose of the ice disc and spirit pills.  Initially, Qin Sang had analyzed the ice disc as some sort of formation core object.</p><p>"Could it be the treasure that suppresses the ice palace's grand formation core?" Qin Sang mused.</p><p>If that were the case, Qin Sang would inevitably be somewhat disappointed.  How could he allow others to sleep soundly beside his bed? With the ancestral mansion revealed, regardless of which faction ultimately controlled it, it would be impossible for him to occupy a cave dwelling here.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>His original body and Manifestation didn't linger for long, flying away swiftly. Qin Sang's gaze swept across the Láng Huán Jade Palace, already forming a plan for his next move. He decided to continue exploring separately with his Manifestation and original body.</p><p>The Northern Wasteland held the suspected tomb of the Water Aspect Master. The entrance of the Formless Immortal Sect bore a stone tablet of the Earth Aspect Hall.</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect's inheritance was related to the Five Elements.  The five lineages, in addition to places like the Scripture Repository, the Artifact Foundry, and the Alchemy Hall, which were most likely to contain treasures, weren't enough for the numerous cultivators within the sect to divide among themselves.</p><p>Furthermore, Old Devil Fan could break free at any time, with remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect and Daoist masters arriving one after another.</p><p>If he were to remain trapped within the Láng Huán Jade Palace for too long, by the time he emerged, the ice palace might already be claimed by others.</p><p>…</p><p>The mountain peak where the Láng Huán Jade Palace stood, among the countless peaks of the Formless Immortal Sect, could be considered quite perilous.  Yet, the mountain's terrain wasn't particularly sharp.</p><p>Clear springs flowed on the mountain, ancient trees provided shade, and misty veils were like dark ink, creating a fresh and elegant scene.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang's Manifestation could see the Láng Huán Jade Palace from afar was because this jade tower was far too conspicuous.</p><p>A platform had been carved out midway up the mountain, and the jade tower was built upon it.  The mountain above the platform was directly sliced away, forming a sheer cliff face. The jade tower stood against this cliff, a thousand zhang tall, reaching into the clouds.</p><p>The peak of the jade tower even surpassed the mountain summit by a bit.</p><p>On the cliff face, beside the jade tower, four ancient characters were vertically inscribed: Láng Huán Jade Palace.</p><p>Two figures flashed out at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang and his Manifestation appeared here.  Seeing a stone tablet erected before the mountain path, inscribed with the three characters 'Path to Scriptures,' they knew they had found the right place.</p><p>His original body walked towards the stone tablet, while his Manifestation paused briefly before continuing north, heading straight for the ice palace.</p><p>…</p><p>The Five Aspect Halls surrounded Emperor's Bestowal Mountain, but the distance between them and the mountain wasn't entirely uniform, some being closer, some further away.</p><p>Their distribution also lacked any obvious pattern, with the only discernible regularity being their alignment with the flow of spiritual veins.</p><p>North of Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The mountain peaks here were lower than elsewhere. As far as the eye could see, there were vast expanses of jungle, green waves covering the undulating mountains.</p><p>The forests were exceptionally lush.  Ancient trees towered into the sky, their crowns like canopies. Clouds and mist flowed among them, lingering for a long time, adding a chilling aura to the jungle.</p><p>A figure was leaping among the treetops.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see that the treetops this person traversed were taller than those surrounding them. All these treetops, arranged in a line, formed a path in the clouds, winding towards the depths of the dense forest.</p><p>Parting the concealing foliage, it became clear that beneath this person's feet lay a series of wooden bridges, hidden among the treetops, forming a hidden path.</p><p>However, these wooden bridges were now dilapidated, many sections severely damaged, clearly bearing the marks of cultivator battles. From these traces, one could glimpse a fragment of the great war that had taken place.</p><p>Restrictions layered the wooden bridges, and this person encountered immense resistance with each step.</p><p>Above his head, a strange light flickered as a small token slowly rotated: the Wood Aspect Token!</p><p>This person was the Strange-Faced Man. After separating from Cave Master Qi Ling, he had come here alone, searching for the Wood Aspect Hall.</p><p>He had already walked here for an unknown amount of time. His scar-ridden face held a hint of impatience, frequently glancing towards the cliff face.</p><p>While the treasures of the Wood Aspect Hall were certainly important, the opportunities within the Immortal Palace couldn't be missed!</p><p>As long as the Wood Aspect Hall's treasures were in his grasp, he wouldn't fear Cave Master Qi Ling reneging on their agreement. He was worried about Zhu Wudao's overbearing actions, fearing Cave Master Qi Ling wouldn't be able to stop him.</p><p>"The Wood Aspect Token can't even control the outer restrictions!" the Strange-Faced Man muttered irritably, yet he could only slowly advance, bridge by bridge. "When I reach the Wood Aspect Hall and open the main hall, it should have some effect, right…"</p><p>As his thoughts flickered, the Strange-Faced Man passed through a section of jungle, finally seeing the silhouette of a palace appear ahead.</p><p>The palace was built above the treetops, bathed in a rich green light, vibrant and alive.  It was entirely constructed of wood, with some cave dwellings even carved directly into the trees themselves.</p><p>The wooden palace in the clouds, natural and harmonious, every corner in perfect accord with nature's essence, seamlessly integrated into the jungle, without the slightest incongruity.</p><p>This was the Wood Aspect Hall!</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's expression lit up with delight. He surged forward abruptly, only to be hindered by the restrictions, letting out a cold snort. A faint green glow suddenly appeared on his body, and with a thunderous boom, his body slammed through the layers of restrictions like a heavy hammer, charging towards the gate of the wooden palace in one go.</p><p>The green glow receded.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man exhaled softly, his gaze shifting to fix upon the main hall located at the center of the wooden palace. Before entering, he turned his head to glance towards the cliff face.</p><p>At that moment, the cliff face was intermittently illuminated by bursts of cyan light, followed by periods of stillness.</p><p>The peculiar scene didn't resemble the normal activation of a teleportation formation, exceeding the Strange-Faced Man's expectations.</p><p>Due to the distance, as well as the obstructions caused by restrictions and clouds and mist, being able to see this much was already his limit. The Strange-Faced Man frowned deeply, unable to fathom what was happening there.</p><p>For some reason, he suddenly had an ominous premonition.</p><p>Without further hesitation, the Strange-Faced Man flashed into the wooden palace.</p><p>…</p><p>At the bottom of two valleys.</p><p>This area was a scene of utter devastation, crisscrossed with ravines, severely ravaged.</p><p>The vegetation had suffered greatly, half withered from the assault of blood energy, the other half completely encased in ice, their vitality extinguished by the freezing cold.</p><p>It was clear that a fierce battle had just taken place.</p><p>Standing on a mountain peak overlooking the valley, Su Zinan watched the cliff face intently, also captivated by the scene unfolding there.</p><p>He wasn't a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect. Those individuals had deliberately concealed crucial information from him. He could only rely on the secrets his foster father had told him and the information he had gathered during his travels to make deductions.</p><p>"Could that be the entrance to the Immortal Palace? Mo Xingdao should have rushed over there, right…"  Su Zinan pursed his lips, looking down at the valley.</p><p>At this moment, the scene within the valley was chaotic beyond measure.</p><p>Icy winds howled, and a blizzard raged.</p><p>It seemed as if an underground river flowed beneath, its waves surging skyward with a deafening roar.  As the waves clashed with the icy air, they generated powerful fluctuations that swept across the valley, constantly expanding outwards.</p><p>However, no matter how strong the fluctuations, they were confined within the valley, unable to affect the outside world, because a blood-red net sealed the valley from above.</p><p>The blood net trembled repeatedly under the impact, yet remained remarkably resilient.</p><p>Beneath the blood net, a figure stood in midair: it was Old Wu, now under Su Zinan's control.</p><p>Old Wu wielded the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd, unexpectedly performing the Heaven-Fixing Halberd, a great divine ability from his lifetime!</p><p>Halberd shadows layered upon each other.</p><p>The astonishing pressure actually suppressed the icy air.</p><p>Just then, a blue light erupted from within the icy air, encasing a pale white water droplet.</p><p>The ice droplet didn't display any particular power, yet Su Zinan's expression suddenly turned grave.  He swiftly pointed two fingers towards the valley, shooting out demonic light that transformed into a black ruler.</p><p>In an instant, the black ruler passed through the blood net and appeared above the water droplet. Ruler shadows filled the sky, omnipresent.</p><p>The myriad ruler shadows abruptly converged, striking the water droplet with overwhelming force.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The water droplet exploded upon impact.</p><p>However, whether it was triggered by the ruler shadows or detonated on its own remained unknown.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>The sound of waves roared.</p><p>Streaks of white water, like bolts of silk, shot out from the water droplet.  Unfortunately, half of the droplet was forcibly suppressed by the black ruler, its light dimmed, falling directly to the valley floor.</p><p>Old Wu guided the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd to the sky above, its tip trembling slightly. The demonic halberd multiplied, raining down in a furious barrage.</p><p>In the next moment, a demonic halberd appeared above each streak of water, locking onto it.</p><p>Su Zinan's pupils turned blood-red, but he didn't look at the water droplet or any of the water streaks. His gaze pierced through the various phenomena, focusing on the cliff face on one side of the valley. His left hand, behind his back, subtly formed a hand seal.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A blood formation, shaped like a talisman disc, suddenly appeared within the earth.</p><p>This was the talisman disc Su Zinan had placed here in advance.</p><p>The talisman disc's power manifested, covering an extremely wide area. Blood-red runes intertwined, like the blood vessels of the earth and mountains, omnipresent.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Rocks shattered.</p><p>A large hole exploded open in the cliff face, revealing a treasure mirror within.</p><p>At this moment, a white shadow appeared within the mirror, but the mirror's surface was entangled with countless blood threads, forcing it to manifest here.</p><p>The white shadow, with disheveled hair, appeared quite disheveled: it was Elder Yanshan.</p><p>With a loud hum, the treasure mirror severed the blood threads, and the white shadow rapidly faded, about to vanish.  Suddenly, the treasure mirror was enveloped by demonic light, and a ruler shadow abruptly appeared above it!</p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoist, you have quite a few escape methods. If not for Su's meticulous net, you would have long slipped away…" Su Zinan's figure appeared at the entrance of the cave, blocking the light.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, his expression darkened.</p><p>Within the valley, the remaining half of the water droplet underwent a sudden change, transforming into an illusory image, flashing towards the valley's exit.</p><p>Old Wu reacted swiftly, the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd flashing and disappearing, piercing into the illusory image.  A loud splash resonated as the illusory image melted into a mass of water, writhing as if undergoing a new transformation.</p><p>At that very moment, two streams of ghostly qi charged in with a shriek, the other two evil shadows of the Three Corpses Death God Banner, tearing at the water frantically.</p><p>Still feeling uneasy, Su Zinan swept his gaze across the valley, chuckling sinisterly, "Fellow Daoist, why not quickly offer your Nascent Soul and enjoy eternal life within my banner? Wouldn't that be delightful?"</p><p>…</p><p>Before the entrance to the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>The Cloud Sculpted Dragon had collapsed.</p><p>The cloud wall had expanded to dozens of times its original size, its overwhelming power stretching across the entrance to the Formless Immortal Sect.  It would take time for this power to dissipate before the area could gradually return to normal.</p><p>Just then, a tear appeared on the inner side of the cloud wall, and the clouds within churned, intermittently flashing with demonic light, toxic clouds, and fist shadows.</p><p>A figure emerged first, escaping the chaos: it was Old Devil Fan.</p><p>Following closely behind, two more figures flew out one after another.  They were actually Poison King and Master Huaiyin, who had arrived later.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, barefoot and clad in a single garment, stepped out from the cloud wall, his demeanor composed, his steps steady. The raging power within had left no trace on him.</p><p>The fissure was about to close.</p><p>A cloud of toxic gas drifted out, and as the cloud dissipated, Poison King's figure was revealed.</p><p>Old Devil Fan appeared considerably more disheveled than the other two, his robes torn in several places.</p><p>A soft chuckle sounded from behind.</p><p>The laughter was tinged with malice.</p><p>Elder Fan, the Grand Elder of the Heavenly Firmament Tower, whose demonic reputation made people tremble in fear outside, was now being mocked by Poison King without any hesitation.</p><p>"The esteemed Grand Elder of the Heavenly Firmament Tower has been reduced to this state!"  While navigating the cloud wall together, Poison King and Master Huaiyin had learned the whole story.</p><p>Feeling humiliated, Old Devil Fan's body flashed with brilliant light, his robes instantly restored to their pristine condition. He raged, "That person is insidious and cunning! The Cloud Dragon's collapse was so opportune, it must be connected to him.  He dares to ruin my plans, I won't let him off!"</p><p>"Old Devil, if you hadn't concealed anything, this person's cultivation is no less than yours or mine, and he was able to outsmart you. You're probably not his match." Poison King taunted, relishing Old Devil Fan's predicament, happy to see the two fight to the death.</p><p>After flying for a while, they saw a range of mountains.</p><p>Poison King muttered, "So this is the Formless Immortal Sect?"</p><p>"Old Daoist Zi Lei and Old Ghost Yue have already entered, could it be fake?" The anger on Old Devil Fan's face vanished, as if he had forgotten his recent displeasure.</p><p>"Interesting! Old Daoist Zi Lei had already appeared in Jin Yu Prefecture, so that was a fake. The Eight Sceneries Alliance has been tightly guarding against the Formless Immortal Sect, yet they've been concealing their actions from the Buddhist Sect, allowing the Formless Immortal Sect remnants to reopen the ancestral mansion.  Truly strange."</p><p>Poison King transmitted his voice secretly, informing Master Huaiyin about various secrets of the Middle State.  He suddenly glanced sideways at Old Devil Fan, "Old Devil, you didn't participate in the Dharma Assembly, yet you're here in the Southern Border now. Were you targeting them all along?"</p><p>"Same to you."</p><p>Old Devil Fan chuckled, swallowing the retort that had risen to his lips. He glanced at Master Huaiyin with some apprehension, already aware of his identity. He mused, "Delayed by the Cloud Dragon, we're a few hours behind those others. One side is the Daoist Sect, the other the Formless Immortal Sect remnants.  Their strength cannot be underestimated…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Poison King interrupted, "Since when did you become so hesitant, Old Devil? We've already lost the initiative. If we don't join forces, are we just going to watch them plunder the treasures?"</p><p>Old Devil Fan laughed heartily, instinctively suppressing his urge to retort. "You're more straightforward than I expected."</p><p>Master Huaiyin asked, "It's said that the Formless Immortal Sect once controlled the Immortal Palace?"</p><p>"Indeed," Poison King looked around, then gazed towards the cliff face.  "The Formless Immortal Sect remnants must be prioritizing the Immortal Palace. The Daoist Sect's motives are harder to gauge, but I doubt they'll readily let the Formless Immortal Sect remnants have their way! The location with the most conspicuous phenomenon is most likely the entrance to the Immortal Palace!"</p><p>Old Devil Fan asked curiously, "Does the Western Land have an Immortal Palace?"</p><p>Master Huaiyin shook his head. "I've never heard of one."</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
