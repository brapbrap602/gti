<h1>Chapter 1801: The Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal</h1><p>The spirit had perished.</p><p>Hearing Master Gu's sigh, Qin Sang frowned slightly and asked, "Can't the spirit be restored when repairing this treasure?"</p><p>Master Gu countered, "Does the Daoist know the difference between innate spiritual treasures, acquired spiritual treasures, and true treasures?"</p><p>Qin Sang respectfully said, "Please, Master, enlighten me."</p><p>Master Qi only knew that spiritual treasures were further categorized, but couldn't explain the characteristics of acquired spiritual treasures and true treasures.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang understood these categories of treasures, Master Gu thought he could save a lot of words and directly explained their characteristics.</p><p>"I dare not take credit, I have only learned this from my sect's classics.  The biggest difference between innate and acquired spiritual treasures lies in their origin. As for whether their power differs, I don't know. It is said that innate spiritual treasures are creations of Heaven and Earth, extremely rare. We artisans can only refine acquired spiritual treasures and true treasures.</p><p>When a cultivator refines a spiritual treasure to the extreme, and a spiritual embryo is about to give birth to a spirit, there are two choices, thus giving rise to acquired spiritual treasures and true treasures.</p><p>A spirit is born, endures Heavenly Tribulation, and becomes an acquired spiritual treasure.</p><p>Or one forcibly interrupts the evolution of the spiritual embryo, dispersing the spirituality and integrating it into the treasure's main body, creating a true treasure.</p><p>There is no superiority or inferiority between these two choices; both are a kind of transformation.</p><p>Acquired spiritual treasures possess spirits that can assist their owner, or independently use the treasure to fight enemies, with many uses and infinite possibilities.</p><p>Possessing a spirit is like having a trustworthy companion, but likewise, the spirit may also betray.</p><p>Moreover, spirits are also among the myriad living beings in the world and must endure Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>True treasures do not need to endure tribulation.</p><p>Furthermore, the spiritual embryo is born from the essence of the artifact. By dispersing the spiritual embryo and completely integrating it into the main body, its power resides in the body itself, becoming purer and more extreme. Unless taken away, it will never betray – this is the greatest advantage of a true treasure.</p><p>In many cases, a true treasure is more suitable than an acquired spiritual treasure.</p><p>It is said that sword cultivators and cultivators who possess natal spiritual treasures mostly choose to refine their natal spiritual treasures into true treasures to help them pursue the pure and ultimate Dao."</p><p>Upon hearing these secrets, Qin Sang instantly understood a great deal. Looking at the broken drum, he murmured, "The spirit's demise is equivalent to the essence of the artifact being scattered…"</p><p>To make an inappropriate analogy:</p><p>Acquired spiritual treasures can be compared to spiritual cultivators; after their demise, their cultivation is lost, leaving only an empty husk.</p><p>True treasures are like physical cultivators; they focus on refining their bodies, and after death, their bodies are also treasures.</p><p>"Correct."</p><p>Master Gu nodded, "A true treasure's power lies in its main body. After destruction, repair is difficult, but once repaired, it can be restored to its peak. Even if it cannot be repaired, the fragments retain some of the main body's power. Acquired spiritual treasures are different…"</p><p>She paused, looking at the broken drum, "If the spirit were still there, even if only a trace of spirituality remained, it could slowly nurture itself back to its original state, even without external force. But if the spirit perishes, even if the main body is repaired to its original state, what remains is merely an inanimate husk."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly understood.</p><p>A fragment of a true treasure still possessed considerable power, and when melted into the Hui Feng Armor, it could withstand Li Hou's fatal blow.</p><p>But the broken drum, with only a hole in it, showed no mystical abilities, being equivalent to an ordinary object.</p><p>"Even husks have gradations.  If the main body of this treasure is restored, can it be used, and to what extent can its former power be restored?" Qin Sang pondered and asked.</p><p>Just as with spiritual cultivators, during cultivation, their bodies are also refined. Although their bodies are not as strong as physical cultivators', they are not ordinary either.</p><p>Moreover, acquired spiritual treasures are made from various heavenly materials and earthly treasures. Even if the spirit perishes, the essence of these heavenly materials and earthly treasures cannot be completely dissipated, leaving not a single drop.</p><p>Master Gu mused, "It's impossible to say for sure. The birth of each acquired spiritual treasure has its own chance encounter; its creation is complex. In my opinion, if the drumhead is repaired, it might be comparable to a spiritual treasure, or it might only be equivalent to a pseudo-spiritual treasure. If this drum was once a senior cultivator's natal spiritual treasure, it might only exhibit the power of a magic treasure."</p><p>This explanation coincided with Qin Sang's guess.</p><p>Repairing an unfamiliar acquired spiritual treasure without the cooperation of its spirit would certainly be extremely difficult.</p><p>Not only would it require exquisite refining techniques and a thorough understanding of the treasure, but it would also necessitate gathering various precious materials and experimenting with them one by one.</p><p>If the final result was only a magic treasure, it would be a waste of effort.</p><p>"Is there no way to revive the spirit?" Qin Sang was unwilling to give up, saying gravely.</p><p>Master Gu shook her head, "Even if such a secret technique exists, to revive something dead like bringing the dead back to life is probably harder than refining a new acquired spiritual treasure, something beyond our capabilities."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed; he also knew that his idea was a bit unrealistic.</p><p>Thinking again of the Shadow Sword within the Qianjun Ring, could this sword also be a postnatal spiritual treasure whose spirit has been extinguished?  He had originally held high hopes for the Broken Drum and the Shadow Sword, but they turned out to be less useful than the fragments of the true treasure.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Master Gu couldn't help but say, "The greatest value of this drum lies in the process of its repair;  one can gain profound insights into the Dao of Refinement. The refiner will surely reap immense benefits."</p><p>As she spoke, she looked at Qin Sang with expectant eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up slightly, understanding Master Gu's implication.</p><p>The allure of a postnatal spiritual treasure was something no refiner could resist. Master Gu had patiently explained so much, all for the sake of this final sentence.</p><p>She could easily find an excuse to exchange the treasure at a lower price;  given her publicly professed recent entry into the Xuan stage and supposed lack of experience, she might well have gotten away with it.</p><p>This action showed that Master Gu was a person of integrity, and that Master Lingxu's assessment of her was high.</p><p>Since the drum itself held little appeal, Qin Sang naturally aimed for the greatest possible value. He pondered, "Master, I am also somewhat versed in the Dao of Refinement.  While I cannot compare to you, my dedication remains strong."</p><p>Master Gu's eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p>She had intended to exchange it for a pseudo-spiritual treasure, which wouldn't have been a bad deal for Qin Sang.  Furthermore, he had just entered the Xuan stage and urgently needed to increase his strength, so she thought he would agree.</p><p>Before Master Gu could finish, Qin Sang rejected her offer without hesitation, "I already possess several defensive treasures; more would be superfluous.  I seek nothing else.  Would I be so fortunate as to receive your guidance in the Dao of Refinement, Master?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang unmoved, Master Gu found herself in a difficult position.</p><p>Her teachings were passed down from her sect and could not be shared freely. If Qin Sang were from a Daoist sect, there might be some room for maneuver.</p><p>"It's not that I am unwilling, but rather, it is restricted by sect rules;  the true teachings of my sect cannot be revealed. I can only offer the refining techniques and texts I have collected over the years, along with my personal insights derived from them to you."</p><p>Whether the value of these things was equal to a damaged postnatal treasure was a matter of opinion.</p><p>Observing Master Gu's expression, Qin Sang confirmed she wasn't haggling.  He mused, "In that case, I have one request.  This treasure will remain temporarily at your residence. I will visit you periodically.  Any insights you gain must be shared completely with me.  Furthermore, should the treasure's repair ever commence, I must be the one to perform the work, with you guiding me."</p><p>This condition was much like the one he'd discussed with Master Qi.</p><p>Master Gu showed a surprised expression;  Qin Sang's audacity was unexpected.  His conditions would only be fulfilled far in the future, yet he dared to leave the damaged treasure with her.</p><p>Simultaneously, Master Gu realized Qin Sang's condition was shrewd; understanding the damaged treasure would inevitably involve her sect's secrets.</p><p>But…</p><p>It was a damaged postnatal treasure!</p><p>She had only heard of it, never seen one before.</p><p>Her sect's lineage contained records of postnatal spiritual treasures, but subsequent generations had been lacking, leading to decline; no one could now create such treasures.</p><p>She only heard from her master of seeing a spirit once, within a great cultivator's residence, reportedly a delicately crafted female child.</p><p>Even a Xuan-stage cultivator, or a fourth-rank official of the Daoist Court, would at most possess a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Finally, Master Gu agreed to Qin Sang's conditions, and they swore an oath.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the Broken Drum toward Master Gu.</p><p>Master Gu's jade fingers pressed against the drum's surface, gently stroking it. After a moment, she swept her sleeve, revealing dozens of jade slips on the table.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked her and put them all into his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>...</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the Beiji Exorcism Academy.</p><p>The golden-armored guards recognized Qin Sang and, having received prior instructions, immediately escorted him to the Ordination Office.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that the Daoist Court's Ordination Office had a structure similar to major sects like the Thunder Left and Right Palaces, but on a grander scale.</p><p>The courtyard gate bore a plaque that read:  White Stone Governance Altar, not some sect's altar.</p><p>Clearly, the name denoted governance through the ordination altar, since ordination was fundamental to the Daoist tradition.</p><p>The inner hall was unlike the Three Suns Hall and the Lei Zu Hall he had seen before; it was the Hou Tu Hall.</p><p>Inside, hung an image of the Hou Tu Earth Mother deity!</p><p>Perhaps because Qin Sang wasn't a Daoist, this ordination ceremony was simple and devoid of elaborate rituals.</p><p>Only three masters were present: the Transmission Master, the Supervision Master, and the Recommendation Master.</p><p>The Recommendation Master was Ning Luo Zhenren; the other two were elderly Daoists with deep, profound auras, yet an inescapable air of weariness about them.</p><p>When the auspicious time arrived, the Transmission Master opened the altar.</p><p>Strangely, instead of a golden seal, a sphere of light emerged from the altar, its internal glow constantly shifting, obscuring its shape.</p><p>Otherwise, everything proceeded as usual.</p><p>The altar was opened.</p><p>The transmission occurred.</p><p>The decree was issued.</p><p>...</p><p>Everything proceeded according to procedure.  Qin Sang knelt, and when he saw the Daoist law split into two, one entering his body and the other ascending as an offering, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The ordination ceremony concluded; the two masters immediately closed the door and dismissed him.</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren gave Qin Sang a Wan Shen Lei Si Xian Yin , setting a date for the retrieval of texts, and then left in a hurry.</p><p>Qin Sang, without hesitation, left the Beiji Exorcism Academy and headed straight for his cave abode.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The cave abode closed, and the protective barrier activated.</p><p>Qin Sang could hardly conceal his eagerness. He immediately sat cross-legged, summoning his altar.</p><p>The altar at this moment was far more complete than before, now possessing a proper altar shape. The Shenxiao Lei Xi  within slowly rotated.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, calmly cultivating within the altar, flew out upon Qin Sang's summons, landing on the ground and curling into a ball.</p><p>The altar's structure consisted of Yuqing Zhao Lei Fu  and Liu Jin Huo Ling Lei Zhao  formations. Qin Sang had now obtained a third-order spell, the Wu Lei Mi Jue , and a new divine talisman.</p><p>The divine talisman containing the Five Thunder Secret Technique was called the Wu Lei Tian Xin Zheng Yin Fu .  Legend said this talisman could form the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Correct Seal, wielding heavenly punishment with unparalleled power and possessing a formidable reputation.</p><p>Of course, what Qin Sang cared most about was the spell's ability to stabilize his Qi; the talisman was merely a bonus.</p><p>He first took out the new Wan Shen Lei Si Xian Yin and quickly scanned it.</p><p>Water Thunder Immortal, Thunder Order Master, Heavenly Thunder Upper Minister, Dragon Thunder Immortal Executioner, Divine Thunder True Executioner…</p><p>The number of gods was fewer than in the second-order spell, and their positions were clearly higher.</p><p>Unfortunately, the names of all the gods were grayed out.</p><p>After looking, Qin Sang put the Wan Shen Lei Si Xian Yin aside and took out some jade slips.  These were some texts from the Beiji Exorcism Academy's collection, given to him beforehand by Ning Luo Zhenren. They contained insights left by previous cultivators of the Five Thunder Secret Technique, helpful for his upcoming comprehension of the talismans.</p><p>Next, he took out a jade box from his Qianjun Ring .</p><p>The box held a demon core, that of a Thunder Turtle, which he planned to refine for altar construction.</p><p>With everything prepared, Qin Sang took a deep breath, entered a meditative state, calmed his mind, and immersed himself in the Five Thunder Secret Technique.</p><p>An incredibly complex talisman structure appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>The Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Correct Seal Talisman!</p><p>Even with the relevant texts and the talisman already partially disassembled, comprehending it still required immense effort from Qin Sang.</p><p>The difficulty of the first scattered form wasn't that great.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to build the altar. He first went through all the scattered forms, reviewed the texts, and formed an overall impression of the talisman before beginning.</p><p>*Sizzle!*</p><p>Lightning illuminated Qin Sang's palm, emitting a fluctuation similar to the Thunder Turtle demon core. This was the remaining thunder power from refining the Thunder Turtle's bones.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes and manipulated this thunder power, drawing in the void.</p><p>With his movements, a winding and intricate talisman emitted a dazzling silver light.</p><p>This step went smoothly; the first scattered form was completed in one go, flashing into the altar.</p><p>The altar trembled, the Shenxiao Lei Xi emitted a bright light, and thunder threads danced within the altar in a chaotic scene.</p><p>However, there was order within the chaos.</p><p>As Qin Sang continuously changed his hand seals, the altar's trembling lessened, the thunder threads converged, and the thunder light in the Shenxiao Lei Xi subsided.</p><p>The third-order altar was complete!</p><p>"Finally done…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't continue; he immediately awoke, his eyes filled with excitement as he inspected his dantian .</p><p>With a thought, he circulated his cultivation technique. The dormant energy in his dantian finally stirred, attracting the spiritual energy in the cave abode, which surged towards him, almost forming a vortex around him.</p><p>Spiritual energy poured into his body relentlessly.</p><p>With the third-order altar suppressing it, there was no sign of disorder, and his cultivation rapidly recovered, breaking through the limits of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>His strength returned!</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and tried a few spells; the familiar feeling returned.</p><p>A smile appeared on his lips; he could finally continue his cultivation.</p><p>This world's spiritual energy was abundant, and his aptitude, having been honed many times, was no less than that of someone with a heaven-grade spiritual root.  His future cultivation would certainly advance by leaps and bounds!</p><p>There was no rush.</p><p>First build the altar, then cultivate.</p><p>He simultaneously comprehended the scattered forms and used thunder power to build the altar, eventually exhausting the thunder power from the bones.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The jade box opened, and the Thunder Turtle demon core flew into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Gently stroking the demon core, Qin Sang sensed the violent power within it. After pondering for a while, he attempted to draw the thunder power from the core.</p><p>Days passed.</p><p>The altar gradually improved.</p><p>Finally, the appointed time arrived, and Qin Sang returned to the Beiji Exorcism Academy.</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren, as promised, brought the texts from the Tian Shu Academy and the Left and Right Thunder Palaces.</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude profusely.</p><p>After taking the texts, he paid another visit to Master Gu before leaving the altar, feeling utterly relieved.</p>
