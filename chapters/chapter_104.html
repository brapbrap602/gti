<h1>Chapter 98: Phoenix Peak of Nine Peaks Mountain</h1><p>Yuan Zhao Sect's issued robes were destroyed in the cave, and Qin Sang wasn't in the mood to tidy himself up either.  After months of fleeing, he looked no different from a savage.</p><p>The weather grew warmer, and the population gradually denser. The towns along the way became more prosperous. Qin Sang felt that the time was right.  He changed into clean clothes, blended into a small town, and inquired about his current location.</p><p>"Zheng State..."</p><p>Qin Sang wolfed down a large meat bun at a bun stall. He had just learned that this place was within Zheng State.  The name felt familiar. He suddenly remembered that Zheng State was on the map given to him by Immortal Han.</p><p>Leaving the bun stall, Qin Sang found a deserted spot and pulled out the map from his storage pouch, sighing with relief.</p><p>Zheng State was indeed on the map, located at the westernmost edge. If he continued west, he would go beyond the map's boundaries.</p><p>Zheng State was southwest of the You Mountain Range, separated by a considerable distance.</p><p>In the south of Zheng State, there was a place called Nine Peaks Mountain.  Judging by the small portion shown on the map, although it was not comparable to You Mountain Range, it was still considered a renowned mountain in the vicinity.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and decided to head to Nine Peaks Mountain, find a secluded and spiritual spot to establish a cave, heal his old wounds, see if he could find other cultivators and gather some information, and then continue south, escaping into the heartland of the righteous sects.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the outcome of that night, but recalling the terrifying sun and the unexpected appearance of the Golden Core cultivator, he felt that the Kui Yin Sect might not have prevailed.</p><p>For such a long time, no one from the Kui Yin Sect had pursued him, which gradually calmed his anxious heart.</p><p>...</p><p>Nine Peaks Mountain, Phoenix Peak.</p><p>Phoenix Peak was once the most beautiful of the nine peaks of Nine Peaks Mountain, with countless enchanting legends.</p><p>From afar, Phoenix Peak resembled a divine phoenix spreading its wings, ready to take flight. Unfortunately, an unexplained earthquake later caused the "Phoenix Stone" to collapse and be destroyed.</p><p>Although the mountain range was still called Nine Peaks Mountain, Phoenix Peak was gradually forgotten, becoming an ordinary peak.</p><p>Later, one day, Phoenix Peak was suddenly enveloped in a perpetual thick fog. Ordinary people who strayed into the fog would get lost, wandering for a long time before finding their way out.  Various legends began to circulate again.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, this former Phoenix Peak had become a gathering place for cultivators near Nine Peaks Mountain. The persistent fog was actually a simple barrier, only affecting mortals.</p><p>At the end of every ten-day period, itinerant cultivators and cultivators from small cultivation families near Nine Peaks Mountain would gather here. The number of attendees wasn't necessarily large, not comparable to a cultivation market, and they were all low-level cultivators.  However, they could exchange goods, share cultivation experiences and bits of news.</p><p>Today was the end of a ten-day period. Early in the morning, several streaks of light arrived together, followed by more people entering the fog.</p><p>As daylight broke, a woman in her thirties landed in front of Phoenix Peak.  With a delighted expression, she said to the young man beside her, "Fellow Daoist Qin, your Cloud Escaping Technique is truly remarkable. It's more discreet and much faster than my Water Escaping Technique. Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for being willing to teach me."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded with a smile.</p><p>The woman traveling with him was named Li Youniang.  Over thirty years old, she was originally an ordinary person from a small village outside Nine Peaks Mountain, married in her teens.</p><p>Later, her husband saved an injured cultivator while gathering firewood in the mountains.  The cultivator was gravely injured and dying. To express his gratitude, he decided to pass on his cultivation techniques before his death. Unfortunately, only Li Youniang possessed a spiritual root, and it was a four-element root. She cultivated for many years to reach the third level of Qi Refining.</p><p>However, after receiving the cultivator's inheritance, Li Youniang did not leave the village to seek immortality.  She didn't despise her husband for being a mortal either. Instead, she continued to live an ordinary life, hidden among common folk.</p><p>She now had three children, and the family lived happily together.</p><p>Half a month ago, her husband suddenly fell seriously ill.  Anxious, Li Youniang went to Phoenix Peak to seek medicine.  She happened to pass by Qin Sang's cave and was stopped by him.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang had found a secluded mountain stream on Nine Peaks Mountain to establish a cave and had been in secluded cultivation, healing his injuries.</p><p>He had intended to make contact with the nearby itinerant cultivators to gather information.  With Li Youniang appearing, he was naturally happy to make her acquaintance. Hearing of her difficulties, he immediately gave her a medicinal pill, which cured her husband's illness.</p><p>Li Youniang regarded Qin Sang as her savior.  When he asked, she readily agreed to bring him to Phoenix Peak for the gathering.</p><p>And tell him that if he wants to gather information, it's best to wait until the end of the month.</p><p>Her master had a good friend named Yu Lian before he passed away. Yu Lian was a disciple of the Yu family, a cultivation family near Nine Summits Mountain. He was well-informed, enjoyed making friends, and would hold forth on Phoenix Peak every month's end.</p><p>Nearly everything the nearby rogue cultivators knew about the cultivation world came from him.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed at Li Youniang's home until the end of the month. Witnessing the harmonious and joyful life of Li Youniang's family, though he didn't necessarily agree with her choices, he admired her steadfastness.</p><p>Li Youniang composed herself and said, "Fellow Daoist Qin, follow me. I'll introduce you to Martial Uncle Yu."</p><p>The illusory formation on Phoenix Peak was ineffective against cultivators. With a simple aura-viewing technique, one could see a path leading directly to the summit. Qin Sang followed Li Youniang, surprised to find that Phoenix Peak held a unique beauty.</p><p>A hollowed-out white rhinoceros horn, a low-grade magical tool with the sole function of condensing water vapor, sat upon the remnants of a divine phoenix statue. The horn's opening faced a small stream below, its gentle flow continuously pouring out from the horn. The stream gurgled, winding its way down the mountain, passing elegant pavilions and flowing waterways.</p><p>Numerous cultivators had already gathered in the various pavilions, conversing in small groups. Li Youniang greeted them as she walked, seemingly familiar with everyone. They were all rogue cultivators from the Nine Summits Mountain area.</p><p>Seeing the unfamiliar face of Qin Sang, everyone was curious, but no one asked.</p><p>Li Youniang led Qin Sang to the summit of Phoenix Peak, arriving at a bamboo pavilion. Inside, seven people surrounded a goateed elder of about seventy, drinking and talking.</p><p>"Speaking of recent events in the cultivation world, a few major things have indeed happened..."</p><p>The goateed elder took a sip of wine, slightly intoxicated and enthusiastic. He deliberately raised his voice, but stopped mid-sentence when he saw Li Youniang and Qin Sang. He waved them over warmly. "Youniang is here! Come in and sit, help your Martial Uncle warm up two jugs of wine. Eh? And this fellow Daoist is?"</p><p>"Martial Uncle Yu, this is Fellow Daoist Qin, the one who saved Sir Lang's life," Li Youniang explained, recounting the previous events for him.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward and bowed. "Qin Sang greets Senior Yu."</p><p>The inebriated look on Yu Lian's face vanished. His small eyes scrutinized Qin Sang. "Youniang and Sir Lang are truly fortunate to have met such a kind-hearted friend as Fellow Daoist Qin. Please, come in."</p>
