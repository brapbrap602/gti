<h1></h1><p>This command token was precisely the last of the Five Phases Tokens—the Fire Phase Token.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist retrieved the Fire Phase Token and ascended the steps.</p><p>After walking for a long time, the sect gate came into view.</p><p>It was similarly a tall jade gate, but the characters inscribed upon it were ‘Reattaining Bodhi.’</p><p>Kun Dao stared at the characters on the jade gate, inevitably puzzled as to why a Buddhist term was carved here.</p><p>“Emperor Bestowal Mountain holds a supremely high position within the Formless Immortal Sect. Initially, it was the ancestral grounds, later evolving to serve numerous functions, but more importantly, it holds symbolic significance.  Myriad methods exist in the world, but times change, the world changes, and heaven and earth transform.  Among all the Dharma Gates, very few cultivators in this era can reach Deity Transformation. It is said that these jade gates commemorate the predecessors of the Formless Immortal Sect who dared to explore new Dharma Gates and cultivated with valiant diligence, each possessing the potential to establish their own sect!  They traversed these new paths, achieved Deity Transformation, effectively pioneering new roads for future generations. Thus, they left behind a flight of steps and a jade gate on Emperor Bestowal Mountain…”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist scrutinized the four characters ‘Reattaining Bodhi.’</p><p>Undoubtedly, the predecessor commemorated by this jade gate cultivated Buddhist Dharma, but ‘Bodhi’ held profound meaning in Buddhism, and its use here was certainly an exaggeration, even presumptuous.</p><p>Of course, the Formless Immortal Sect cared not for the opinions of outsiders.</p><p>“Could this predecessor have fallen from the Deity Transformation realm, or perhaps switched to cultivating Buddhist Dharma and re-entered Deity Transformation?”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist did not delve deeper, instead focusing his attention on the sea of mist beyond the jade gate. He gestured for Kun Dao to approach him, and they passed through the gate together.</p><p>They encountered the same phenomenon as Qin Sang.</p><p>As the tide of mist surged towards them, the Fire Phase Token flickered with crimson light, enveloping the two and guiding them to a jade pavilion.</p><p>The entire pavilion was constructed from a type of spiritual jade, devoid of any runes or inscriptions, appearing utterly pure.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist shook the Fire Phase Token in his hand, but the jade pavilion remained unchanged, its doors firmly shut.</p><p>He examined the Fire Phase Token again.</p><p>The token had led them to the pavilion, yet it elicited no further response.</p><p>Kun Dao was somewhat surprised. “This isn’t the key to open the pavilion?”</p><p>“When the experts of the Formless Immortal Sect activated the grand formation, sealing themselves within the mountain, these tokens were forged, divided into the Five Phases. Since there’s no reaction, it's likely that after tens of thousands of years, the experts of the Formless Immortal Sect have long since ascended, and there's no one inside to receive us. However, this also has its advantages. Without anyone controlling the grand formation, it will simply operate according to its inherent patterns. With the Fire Phase Token, we needn’t worry about being annihilated by the formation and can gradually discern its workings,” the white-robed Daoist stroked his beard, contemplating as he examined the pavilion’s doors.</p><p>Then, he signaled Kun Dao to retreat three zhang, and with a slight flick of his wrist, his Crimson Fire Sword flew from his hand.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A crimson sword shadow shot straight towards the pavilion’s doors.</p><p>Upon impact, there was no sound of collision, but a red halo burst forth, instantly sweeping towards them.  The halo appeared unassuming, yet it contained astonishing power.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist’s expression turned solemn, and without hesitation, he held the Fire Phase Token horizontally before his chest.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>Upon contact with the Fire Phase Token, the halo dissipated soundlessly.</p><p>Seeing this, the white-robed Daoist’s expression relaxed slightly, and he continued to strike with his sword, thrusting again and again at the jade doors.</p><p>Observing his actions, Kun Dao grew increasingly perplexed. She was well aware of her senior brother’s strength; his swordsmanship shouldn’t be so light and airy, and the speed of his strikes was growing slower.</p><p>She didn't see the strange glint in the white-robed Daoist’s eyes as he attacked, deducing something with each strike.</p><p>Before long, the white-robed Daoist finally gained some insight. He let out a loud laugh, recalled his Crimson Fire Sword with a flip of his palm, and ran his fingers along the blade, channeling his energy through it.</p><p>Wherever his fingers passed, crimson flames erupted, and the sword hummed resonantly.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist pointed at a specific spot on the pavilion’s doors.</p><p>In the next moment, sword energy arced like a rainbow.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>An unprecedentedly dazzling halo suddenly exploded. Although the Fire Phase Token neutralized the halo as it rushed towards them, the residual force continued to surge into the depths of the mist, creating waves of disturbance.</p><p>As swift as lightning, the white-robed Daoist, holding the Fire Phase Token, pressed it against the center of the exploding halo.  Unexpectedly, it met no resistance and sank into the door!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The jade pavilion trembled slightly.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist retreated swiftly.  Looking at the pavilion again, a new token had appeared, having shifted itself to the lintel above the door.</p><p>The Fire Phase Token merged with the jade pavilion, becoming one with it!</p><p>With a ‘creak,’ the tightly closed doors of the jade pavilion opened a sliver.</p><p>The two exchanged a glance.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist used his sword to push the door, finding no resistance.  With a gentle nudge, it swung open, revealing, unexpectedly, a pitch-black void behind it.</p><p>The grand formation was interconnected; a single change affected the whole.</p><p>Kun Dao dared not move, watching the white-robed Daoist.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist took a step towards the jade pavilion, and Kun Dao quickly followed.  However, the white-robed Daoist suddenly froze, as if sensing something, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang had already entered the jade pavilion.</p><p>Like the white-robed Daoist, he utilized the protective properties of the Wood Phase Token, constantly testing the changes in the pavilion’s restrictions.</p><p>Although he didn’t know the secrets of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, by perceiving the shifting restrictions through the Wood Phase Token, combined with his accumulated knowledge of restrictive formations and the aid of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he also discovered the underlying principles. He used the Wood Phase Token to open the pavilion’s doors, entering even earlier than the two from the Jade Terrace Sect.</p><p>However, the scene inside the pavilion greatly exceeded his expectations.</p><p>From the outside, the pavilion didn’t appear particularly large.</p><p>Yet, behind the doors was not a hall, but a void.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sensation of drifting in empty space, as if this space had no boundaries. It was deathly silent, devoid of any sound or tangible objects.</p><p>The only thing he could sense was the entrance, the pavilion's doors, which remained fixed in one position.</p><p>Assured that he could return at any time, Qin Sang began to explore boldly. Using the pavilion's doors as a marker, he flew straight towards the deepest part of the space, comprehending its changes as he traveled.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang gained some understanding.</p><p>He could confirm that this wasn't a real space, but one formed by the power of a formation. While he seemed to be moving through space, he was actually being constantly shifted by invisible restrictions, preventing him from reaching an exit.</p><p>The spiritual formation used this method to prevent people from entering Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>If someone were guiding him, he could easily find the way out, but now he had to rely on himself to discover the pattern.</p><p>However, as long as he found the key, there would be a way to break it.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was not a difficult task, merely one that required some time.</p><p>…</p><p>“Crows Fly, Rabbits Run.”</p><p>Before a jade gate…</p><p>Zhu Wudao, Su Zinan, Mo Xingdao, and Old Devil Fan arrived at this location.  Looking at the inscription on the jade gate, Su Zinan softly recited the words, unable to grasp their meaning.</p><p>This phrase described the passage of time, the changing of day and night, and its meaning in this context was unclear.</p><p>Old Devil Fan lingered outside, making his own markings. Seeing the conspicuous white jade steps behind the jade gate leading straight into the sea of mist, he grumbled, “Junior Brother Zhu, the path beyond the gate is clearly visible.  Are you exaggerating, trying to frighten us?”</p><p>Zhu Wudao responded with a smile.  “Without a Five Phases Token, the white jade steps are real. With a Five Phases Token, one realizes they are an illusion! If Senior Brother doesn’t believe me, you are welcome to try entering.”</p><p>Although Old Devil Fan was suspicious, he wouldn't fall for such a trick.  He snorted, “If that’s the case, I won’t rush in. I'll wait for my helpers to arrive, and we'll enter the mountain together.”</p><p>Zhu Wudao sighed. “I swear I haven’t uttered a single falsehood. It’s enough for Senior Brother to guide them here. Once you help me break the grand formation and shift the mountains and change the positions, the path into the mountain will reveal itself, and they will quickly catch up. Senior Brother mustn’t forget, two groups have already gone ahead of us, and one of them includes Old Daoist Zi Lei!”</p><p>A glint flashed in Su Zinan’s eyes as he feigned confusion. “Since we’re already here, why does Elder Fan continue to be so secretive?  I wonder which esteemed cultivators those two Daoist friends are. If they were the ones who caused the disturbance at the Fire Phase Hall, they might not be able to escape so easily.  Surely we can’t all just wait here.”</p><p>Judging by Old Devil Fan’s serious demeanor along the way, it didn’t seem like a pretense.</p><p>Yet, his helpers were still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Su Zinan had probed several times, eager to uncover their identities.</p><p>“Heh heh, when they arrive, Fellow Daoist Su will naturally know.  Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, their cultivation is no less than ours.  A mere remnant formation can't trap them.”</p><p>Old Devil Fan knew that Zhu Wudao had gathered many experts.</p><p>Besides Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao, there was also the Wailing Souls Cave Master on another route, making at least five Grand Cultivators allied with Zhu Wudao.</p><p>The Daoist sect also had three Grand Cultivators.</p><p>Old Devil Fan felt deeply outnumbered and preferred to drag Poison King and Master Huaiyin into the mix, muddying the waters.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, waves of mist suddenly surged from the western side of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, accompanied by flickering spiritual light.</p><p>Such phenomena were common on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  Su Zinan and the other two glanced over casually, paying no mind. Only Zhu Wudao’s expression changed, and after a quick calculation, he muttered, “This is not good.”</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Su Zinan asked curiously.</p><p>“Someone else has entered the mountain, and they possess a Five Phases Token!” Zhu Wudao's expression was grave, but unnoticed, a hint of joy flickered in his eyes.</p><p>“The Earth Phase Token is in the hands of the Daoist sect, and the two from the Wailing Souls Cave hold the Wood Phase Token.  The Water and Fire Tokens haven't appeared yet,” Su Zinan mused, lost in thought.</p><p>Only he knew that the Water Phase Token was in his possession!</p><p>Zhu Wudao shook his head. “It’s not the Water Phase Token!  Based on the formation’s movements, it corresponds to the Fire Phase Token!”</p><p>His understanding of Emperor Bestowal Mountain far surpassed others’, allowing him to deduce parts of the formation’s patterns from outside.</p><p>“The Fire Phase inheritor!”</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao exchanged glances, both thinking of the Fire Devil simultaneously.</p><p>They had suspected it earlier, and now it was confirmed.</p><p>Su Zinan was uncertain whether the Fire Rhinoceros Horn had been retrieved by the Fire Phase inheritor or had fallen into the hands of Old Devil Fan’s helpers.</p><p>However, one thing was certain: the Ice Instrument Divine Disc was in the Fire Devil’s possession!</p><p>“Senior Brother Fan, are you sure you still want to wait?” Zhu Wudao frowned at Old Devil Fan.</p><p>Old Devil Fan sneered inwardly, but seeing that Zhu Wudao’s expression wasn’t feigned, he also became hesitant.  Three groups had already entered the mountain, including descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect.  If he waited any longer, the opportunities might be taken.</p><p>Seeing his hesitation, Su Zinan inwardly cursed the old devil's indecisiveness, wondering why Zhu Wudao insisted on involving him.  Had he known, he would have abandoned them and acted alone.</p><p>Finally, Old Devil Fan nodded. The four of them entered in single file, arriving at the jade pavilions.</p><p>The three jade pavilions were identical in appearance.</p><p>However, Zhu Wudao’s approach differed from Qin Sang’s.</p><p>He stood directly in front of the pavilion’s doors, initially probing as well, but instead of merging his Gold Phase Token with the pavilion, he, after some exploration, instructed Su Zinan and the others to attack it.</p><p>With Zhu Wudao controlling the Gold Phase Token, the others couldn’t accurately perceive the changes in the pavilion’s restrictions and could only follow his instructions.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao stood to Zhu Wudao’s left, while Old Devil Fan stood to his right.</p><p>The four of them unleashed their respective powers.</p><p>Under Zhu Wudao’s guidance, magical treasures and Daoist techniques continuously bombarded the pavilion, causing flashes of light to erupt frequently.  Initially, the pavilion remained unshaken, but under the relentless assault of the four Grand Cultivators, the tremors grew increasingly violent.</p><p>The halos released by the pavilion were blocked by the Gold Phase Token, allowing them to disregard the backlash and attack without restraint.</p><p>However, Su Zinan and the other two were shrewd individuals. Seeing Zhu Wudao insistently make them attack the pavilion, they began to suspect his motives.</p><p>“Junior Brother Zhu, it takes the combined strength of four Grand Cultivators to barely shake this pavilion.  The other groups, only the Daoist sect might possess comparable means; the rest will likely be hindered by the pavilion for a considerable time.  If that's the case, why worry about being overtaken?”</p><p>Old Devil Fan narrowed his eyes, the power of his demonic weapon diminishing abruptly.</p><p>Zhu Wudao’s expression remained unchanged. He raised the Gold Phase Token and said in a deep voice, “Indeed, I can’t deceive Senior Brother!  You’re right, there’s another method. We can use the Five Phases Tokens to open the pavilion and discern the patterns of the restrictions within, slowly finding the correct path. They’re certainly using that method. But we’re already behind; if we follow the established procedure, we’ll inevitably be left behind.  Following my method, destroying the pavilion might seem reckless, but it actually eliminates many complications, allowing us to directly reach the heart of the mountain!”</p><p>Su Zinan frowned.  “Fellow Daoist Zhu, Emperor Bestowal Mountain is the shared domain of the Five Phases, a sacred ground of legacy. We could sense the might of the spiritual formation even at the foot of the mountain.  Are you certain we can destroy the pavilion with brute force?”</p><p>“Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, if I dare to suggest this, I naturally have confidence.  Tens of thousands of years ago, or if this formation were controlled by someone, destroying the pavilion would be impossible.  The Formless Immortal Sect has been sealed for tens of thousands of years, the earth veins have shifted, and this is our opportunity. Moreover, the more Five Phases Tokens are in place, the more advantageous it is for us.  As you can see, the pavilion is already weakening,” Zhu Wudao spoke with absolute certainty.</p><p>As he said, the pavilion was shaking violently.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone fell silent, increasing their efforts.</p><p>While they attacked the pavilion…</p><p>Poison King, Master Huaiyin, and Qin Sang’s avatar also ascended Emperor Bestowal Mountain one after another.</p><p>The avatar arrived at the jade gate and, seeing the mark left by his original body, waited as instructed.</p><p>Knowing the dangers of the spiritual formation beyond the gate, the avatar sat down to meditate and adjust his Qi, taking out the lotus platform for examination.  Judging by its size, the Wishing-Fulfilling Pearl would fit perfectly within the platform, a seamless match.</p><p>But whether the two treasures were a set would only be known after reuniting with his original body.</p><p>"The Wishing-Fulfilling Pearl is a defensive treasure. If it merges with the lotus platform, will the protective barrier's power increase?"</p><p>The avatar wondered inwardly, extending his spiritual sense into the lotus platform, yet he sensed no spiritual presence. It likely wasn't a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Poison King and Master Huaiyin were similarly blocked outside the gate.</p><p>“Old Devil Fan told us to wait outside and join forces to seize the Deity Transformation opportunity.  When did that old devil become so generous, willing to share opportunities with outsiders?  Is he bluffing, or did he encounter a formidable opponent and intend to divert trouble onto us?”  Poison King found Old Devil Fan's mark and sneered.</p><p>Their agreement with Old Devil Fan held no binding power.</p><p>Master Huaiyin gazed into the sea of mist and commented, “This place is not to be trifled with.”</p><p>“Very well,” Poison King glanced around.  Having just recovered from the Fire Poison, he was in excellent spirits and decided to trust Old Devil Fan for once, waiting patiently.</p><p>After a moment of thought, he flicked his sleeve, and a streak of black light shot out.</p><p>A faint crimson glow permeated the black light, giving it a rather eerie appearance.</p><p>Poison King pricked his fingertip, forcing out a drop of blood essence, which merged into the black light and was instantly devoured.</p><p>Simultaneously, Poison King's face turned deathly pale, as if he had paid a considerable price. His exceptionally beautiful features took on a touch of fragility.</p><p>The black light wriggled, then abruptly turned and charged towards the mountain with a screech.</p><p>“That person really went in!” Poison King said coldly.</p>
