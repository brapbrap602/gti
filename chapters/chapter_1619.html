<h1></h1><p>Outside Rainbow City.</p><p>The old monk and the woman journeyed north.</p><p>As they neared Rainbow City, the woman sensed something, her expression shifting slightly. She flashed down to the summit of a mountain below. With a gentle tap of her foot, the mountain trembled, loose rocks tumbled, and her True Essence vibrated the void.</p><p>"Come out!"</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>Several streaks of escaping light instantly flew out from the shadows.</p><p>Unexpectedly, someone was hiding in this desolate wilderness.</p><p>Among them, two auras, one azure and one black, were the strongest and fastest, their momentum exceptionally fierce. At the same time, a thunderous, rough voice came from the black escaping light.</p><p>"Who dares disturb me..."</p><p>The clamor abruptly ceased.</p><p>The person within the black light seemed to have their throat constricted.</p><p>"Holy King!"</p><p>A delighted voice rang out from the azure light as it rushed to the mountaintop. A figure in azure armor appeared, bowing deeply. "This subordinate greets the Holy King!"</p><p>The black light followed closely behind, revealing a burly man in black robes. Seeing the woman's enigmatic smile, the burly man felt uneasy and hurriedly followed the azure-armored figure in bowing. "This subordinate was disrespectful. Please, Holy King, mete out punishment!"</p><p>They were all unexpectedly of the妖 race (demon/yokai kind).</p><p>The clothing and armor on the azure-armored figure and the burly man were clearly extraordinary treasures, capable of concealing their identities well. The other demon kind all exuded varying degrees of demonic aura.</p><p>The woman was none other than the current Holy King of the demon race, the master of the East Sea Holy King's Palace—Holy King Qinghu!</p><p>The old monk was the Buddhist Divine Transformation expert, Holy One Huiguang, who had already entered Rainbow City ahead of them.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu asked, "The human race is holding a Dharma Assembly. What are you doing here?"</p><p>"Reporting to the Holy King, we haven't seen the Holy King return for a long time and were worried about your safety. We searched all the way from the East Sea to this place. We learned that there's a custom of Divine Transformation experts appearing at human Dharma Assemblies, so we thought there might be news of the Holy King..."</p><p>The azure-armored figure was interrupted mid-sentence by Holy King Qinghu's snort.</p><p>"Once you confirmed that this King and the human Divine Transformation experts had disappeared, you dared to carve up the Holy King's Palace, didn't you?"</p><p>"This subordinate wouldn't dare!"</p><p>The azure-armored figure and the burly man were terrified by her words and loudly protested their innocence.</p><p>The azure-armored figure, quick-witted, said repeatedly, "Holy King, please see clearly! This subordinate is completely loyal to the Holy King! It's just that that scoundrel Longjing, seeing that the Holy King was absent, colluded with Liuzhu in secret, plotting treason. This subordinate had no choice but to seal the Holy King's Palace and flee here."</p><p>Holy King Qinghu was merely reprimanding them and didn't intend to truly punish them. She said, "What major events have occurred during the years this King has been absent?"</p><p>"Two hundred years ago, that scoundrel Longjing started stirring up trouble. Several Transformation realm companions were attacked and mysteriously disappeared without a trace. It's highly likely he was the one who killed them. A hundred years ago, he even personally led his shrimp soldiers and crab generals, deliberately passing by the Holy King's Palace. This is a crime of disrespect that should be punished! One hundred and thirty years ago, the Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo bloomed. This subordinate has already blocked the news."</p><p>...</p><p>The azure-armored figure recounted the events of these years one by one.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu seemed somewhat absent-minded.</p><p>The demonic whispers of the Heavenly Dao persisted, and ascension was seemingly becoming an illusion. There was nothing more important than this in the mortal world, and other matters hardly stirred any ripples in her heart.</p><p>But when the azure-armored figure mentioned a particular event, Holy King Qinghu's expression drastically changed. "What did you say?  Ferocious Beasts?"</p><p>The azure-armored figure was very surprised that the Holy King didn't even know about the Ferocious Beasts.</p><p>Ferocious Beasts roamed within the Storm Belt, each at least at the Divine Transformation level, and there was more than one.  For decades, and sometimes just a few years, a Ferocious Beast would pass through the Central Continent.</p><p>The current Storm Belt was countless times more dangerous than before.</p><p>At least, at the Nascent Soul level, the matter of the Ferocious Beasts was common knowledge.</p><p>Previously, there were still Nascent Soul cultivators who ventured beyond the barrier, traveling within the Storm Belt. With good luck, they might obtain opportunities and discover ancient treasures.</p><p>Now, almost no one dared to go out; encountering a Ferocious Beast meant certain death.</p><p>The only fortunate thing was that the Central Continent's barrier seemed to possess a certain power that these Ferocious Beasts feared or disliked, preventing them from approaching.</p><p>It was still safe within the barrier.</p><p>The Holy King didn't know about the Ferocious Beasts? Could it be that she was truly trapped somewhere?</p><p>The azure-armored figure thought to himself, but didn't dare to pry into the Holy King's experiences. "More than two hundred years ago, someone first discovered a Ferocious Beast, and more appeared later. The Ferocious Beasts are incredibly powerful.  Both races have had overconfident individuals who attempted to spy on the Ferocious Beasts and lost their lives. Their origins are unknown, and their nature is savage, completely devoid of reason..."</p><p>The woman's expression was grave. After pondering for a moment, she suddenly soared towards Rainbow City.</p><p>The azure-armored figure and the burly man exchanged glances, ordered the other demons to remain and await orders, and then hurriedly followed the Holy King. Within Rainbow City, human experts gathered. They hadn't dared to approach before, but now that the Holy King had returned, they had nothing to fear.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu flew above Rainbow City, her gaze sweeping across the city.  She flashed towards a verdant hill in the north of the city.</p><p>Lush forests and bamboo groves covered the hill, with a temple faintly visible within.</p><p>Before they approached, an urgent bell sounded from the mountain, signaling an alarm.</p><p>"Who goes there!"</p><p>Dozens of monks flew out instantly, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p><p>At this moment, the voice of Abbot Xingji, the head of the Sweet Dew Monastery, came from within the temple. "Don't be rude! Junior Brother Xingzhen, please invite these benefactors into the mountain."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>A young-looking monk stepped forward, gesturing for the disciples to open the formation. He chanted a Buddhist prayer.  "Benefactors, my senior brother invites you."</p><p>Holy King Qinghu hadn't intended to stop anyway. She barged straight into the temple, causing the monks to frown.</p><p>Inside the temple.</p><p>Abbot Xingji, despite his esteemed position, could only stand at the lower end, respectfully speaking to the old monk. Seeing Holy King Qinghu barge in, he fell silent.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu asked bluntly, "Old monk, are you aware of the Ferocious Beasts' rampage?"</p><p>Holy One Huiguang nodded.  "I just learned of it."</p><p>After a pause, Holy One Huiguang addressed Abbot Xingji and the two demons.  "You may leave now."</p><p>This was something he and Holy King Qinghu had agreed upon beforehand.  The matter of the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers could not be revealed for now, or it would surely cause panic in the cultivation world and throw the world into chaos.</p><p>For the vast majority of cultivators, ascension was a distant goal, but at least it was a goal.</p><p>Now, let alone ascension, under the influence of the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers, the Heart Demon Tribulation during breakthroughs would definitely be extremely terrifying.  They might not even be able to overcome this hurdle.</p><p>With the path of immortality severed, their only hope lost, and eternal life out of reach, what else could they pursue?</p><p>In their despair, there was no guarantee they wouldn't do something drastic.</p><p>"The Ferocious Beasts' rampage began after the appearance of the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers!"</p><p>Holy King Qinghu said gravely, "The Returning Ruins is the Ferocious Beasts' nest, where the Beacon Gate lies. The Ferocious Beasts only operate near the Returning Ruins. Their sudden scattering must mean something has changed in the Returning Ruins! The source of the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers is likely in the Returning Ruins, and the Immortal Palace's ascension is just a trigger!"</p><p>"This poor monk also has this suspicion," Holy One Huiguang agreed.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu acted decisively. "In that case, it goes without saying which is more important. We must quickly go out to sea and make preparations to hunt the Ferocious Beasts!  Over time, the madness accumulated within you and me from the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers will grow stronger, and we will eventually lose control.  This King doesn't want to completely become a lunatic!  We should aim to capture the Ferocious Beasts alive. Although their nature is savage, there's a chance we can obtain some fragments from their memories and learn what happened in the Returning Ruins.  This King will order someone to return to the palace and bring the protective formation flags. Old monk, you should stop focusing on the Dharma Assembly. After hunting the Ferocious Beasts, this King will help you deal with those insignificant pests."</p><p>...</p><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled day and night, crossing the Six States of Jiangzuo and arriving at the Southern State.</p><p>Returning to the Southern State, Qin Sang was familiar with the roads and headed straight for the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>As he neared the Taiyue Sect, Qin Sang concealed himself, hiding in the shadows as he cautiously approached.</p><p>There were no abnormalities along the way.</p><p>There were no signs of troop movements from any factions; the attention of the Central Continent's cultivation world was focused on the Ullambana Assembly.</p><p>Qin Sang was most concerned about the Eight Sceneries Sect. He hadn't discovered any movements from True Person Zilei yet, and he didn't know how many experts the Eight Sceneries Sect had sent this time.</p><p>The Taiyue Sect's mountain gate was located within the Taiyue Mountains, in the northern part of the Southern State.</p><p>This area was blessed with beautiful scenery, unlike the southern part where miasma was rampant. It was only slightly inferior to the Six States of Jiangzuo.</p><p>Most of the sect forces in the Southern State were concentrated here.</p><p>The Taiyue Mountains had a strategic terrain and abundant spiritual energy, and without the miasma, it was an excellent place for cultivation.</p><p>The mountain range stretched for tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>The Taiyue Sect only occupied a few spiritually rich peaks, but the entire mountain range was within their sphere of influence. Only a few sects subordinate to the Taiyue Sect were allowed to establish themselves within the Taiyue Mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang infiltrated the Taiyue Mountains without encountering any resistance.</p><p>The Taiyue Sect seemed unaware that someone was plotting against them.  The disciples within the sect were still carefree. Qin Sang encountered several groups of Taiyue Sect disciples, some visiting relatives and friends, others going out on training missions.</p><p>"It seems the Gu God Sect hasn't made their move yet."</p><p>Qin Sang quietly appeared on the peak of a desolate mountain, gazing towards the Taiyue Sect. After some thought, he didn't continue forward. Instead, he carved out a cave dwelling on the spot and hid himself.</p><p>The emergence of the Formless Immortal Sect would undoubtedly cause a great commotion; it would be impossible to keep it hidden. Otherwise, the Gu God Sect wouldn't have to wait for the Ullambana Assembly. He would definitely be able to sense it from here.  Getting too close might lead to his discovery by both sides.</p><p>He had no grudges with the Eight Sceneries Sect or the Gu God Sect.  With the situation unclear, he didn't want to choose sides so early.</p><p>After creating the cave dwelling and carefully concealing it, Qin Sang awakened the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to maintain vigilance, while he continued to explore the Sun God Tree.</p><p>...</p><p>Somewhere else.</p><p>This seemed to be an underground cavern.</p><p>The cavern was dim.</p><p>Figures lurked within, each possessing a powerful aura.  Crowded together like this, they appeared inconspicuous.</p><p>Inside the cavern, there was a jade wall.</p><p>The jade wall emitted a faint light, its surface rippling like water. Within, there was a scene of chaos, indistinct and difficult to discern.</p><p>At this moment, two people stood before the jade wall, intently staring at it, silently waiting for something.</p><p>One of them was True Person Zilei, the Sect Master of the Eight Sceneries Sect.</p><p>The other person wasn't a Daoist. He wore a robe embroidered with mountains in black and yellow, appearing to be around forty years old.  His face was firm, his tiger-like eyes sharp, and he exuded an air of authority.  He was Yue Lingtian, the current Sect Master of the Taiyue Sect!</p><p>The leaders of the two great sects were unexpectedly not in Golden Jade State, but hidden in this narrow underground cavern!</p><p>A period of oppressive silence followed.</p><p>Yue Lingtian calculated the time silently, then couldn't help but say, "Why hasn't there been any news from Hegao yet?"</p><p>"Don't be anxious."</p><p>True Person Zilei remained calm and composed. "According to the information we've gathered, breaking the Formless Immortal Sect's grand formation requires the Five Phase Command Talismans. The more talismans are missing, the greater the difficulty, and the greater the price to be paid. The most crucial point is that the speed of breaking the formation will also slow down. The longer it takes, the more experts will be attracted.  With Junior Brother infiltrating the Gu God Sect with the Earth Command Talisman, even if the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect suspect him, they'll definitely wait until the Formless Immortal Sect opens before taking action."</p><p>Yue Lingtian hummed in agreement. "I'm worried that Qishen will make a mistake at the Dharma Assembly. That old baldy's Buddhist Dharma is profound and can see through people's hearts. I'm afraid Junior Brother Qishen's cultivation is too shallow, and he'll be exposed."</p><p>"Junior Brother and the others took the Cloudveil Vestment with them. Their cultivation is no lower than yours or mine.  As long as they are cautious and avoid fighting, they shouldn't be exposed. Once we enter the Formless Immortal Sect, even if they are exposed, it won't affect the overall situation," True Person Zilei clearly had everything planned out, having calculated every step.</p><p>"It's a pity that Junior Brother Qishen and the others had to go to Golden Jade State. We're a bit short-handed here. How confident are you, Daoist Brother, in taking down the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect?"</p><p>Yue Lingtian calculated with his fingers. "Since they're using the Five Immortal Command Talismans to activate the grand formation, not counting Hegao, they'll need at least four Grand Cultivators.  If there aren't enough talismans, they'll need even more. A centipede dies but doesn't stiffen; it's truly a wise saying.  The Formless Immortal Sect has been destroyed for so many years, yet they can still gather such a powerful force!  News from Golden Jade State says that Su Zinan doesn't seem to have appeared there. There's also Mo Xingdao, the number one rogue cultivator of the Northern Wastelands, who's inseparable from Su Zinan. I'm afraid these two have also been recruited by the Gu God Sect."</p><p>True Person Zilei calmly said, "It doesn't matter. Our goal this time isn't to eliminate the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect.  That should be the responsibility of the Buddhist and Daoist sects, not ours alone."</p><p>Yue Lingtian pondered, not pursuing the matter further.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the jade wall suddenly flickered. The halo flowed inwards, outlining a blurry figure of a female Daoist.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Sect Master! Sect Master Yue!"</p><p>The female cultivator was the only late Nascent Soul cultivator in the Eight Sceneries Sect, her Daoist title being True Person Su Xia.</p><p>True Person Su Xia's voice was also somewhat ethereal as it reached their ears.  "Senior Brother Hegao sent news. They've already set off and infiltrated the Taiyue Sect. They are currently setting up formations in secret, sealing off the Taiyue Sect."</p><p>"The Formless Immortal Sect is truly within my sect's grounds?"</p><p>Yue Lingtian had a premonition, but upon receiving confirmation, he was still very surprised, repeatedly asking, "Which peak?"</p><p>"It's unclear at the moment. However, the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect went to Soaring Dragon Cliff first," the female cultivator replied. "Senior Brother Sect Master, you can set off now."</p><p>"Soaring Dragon Cliff!"</p><p>Yue Lingtian's eyes widened in disbelief.  "This Sect Master has cultivated on Soaring Dragon Cliff for hundreds of years, and I've never sensed anything unusual!"</p><p>He wasn't the only one.</p><p>Soaring Dragon Cliff was the cultivation grounds for successive Sect Masters of the Taiyue Sect. The entire sect had been kept in the dark.</p><p>True Person Zilei's expression remained unchanged. He then asked, "Besides the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect, who else is there?"</p><p>True Person Su Xia replied, "Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao are both there, and they haven't concealed their identities. However, Su Zinan doesn't have the Nether Moon Guards with him. From this, we can deduce that the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect didn't reveal their secrets to him beforehand. They are suspicious of each other and are not a united front. This can be exploited."</p><p>This news wasn't unexpected.</p><p>True Person Zilei wasn't surprised. He nodded and said, "Anything else?"</p><p>"There's another Grand Cultivator of unknown origin."</p><p>True Person Su Xia paused before continuing. "It's said that this person is also a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, but they don't possess any of the Five Phase Command Talismans.  Senior Brother said that the Gu God Sect has only gathered the Metal and Wood talismans. Counting Senior Brother's Earth Command Talisman, there are only three!"</p><p>"The Water and Fire talismans are still missing!"</p><p>True Person Zilei suddenly realized. "The Gu God Sect Master has been collecting Five Elements treasures everywhere, precisely to refine treasures and compensate for the missing Five Phase Command Talismans... Has Junior Brother not discerned his true identity yet?"</p><p>True Person Su Xia gently shook her head. "Senior Brother isn't certain yet. However, in Senior Brother's opinion, the resources this person can mobilize are vast, far beyond that of a rogue cultivator. He must hold a high position within a certain sect."</p>
