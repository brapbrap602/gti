<h1>Chapter 678: Refining Tools</h1><p>For cultivators, as long as spiritual energy is abundant, nothing is a problem.</p><p>The city on Allrock Island may seem simple and crude, but in reality, it's home to a considerable number of mortals and low-level cultivators, presenting a scene of prosperity.</p><p>In the Demon Sea, few islands enjoy the lasting stability of Allrock Island.  With its rich monster resources, not only do the island's original inhabitants thrive, but many foreign cultivators also venture across the sea to settle here.</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked with Ran Luo and the others, easily locating the cave dwelling under Ran Luo's guidance.</p><p>Elder Zou had chosen a cave dwelling on the edge of the city, near a barren mountain. This location was chosen with specific reasons in mind.</p><p>The mountain, known as Redstone Mountain, differed from other rocky mountains. Its stones had a faint reddish hue due to an underground fire vein. The island's lord had established numerous fire chambers on the mountain, making it an excellent location for both tool refining and alchemy.</p><p>Ran Luo and Elder Zou were busy organizing their personnel, leaving Qin Sang undisturbed in his cultivation.</p><p>Ten days later, Ran Luo finally sought him out.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, have you rested well? If you're free, how about we start refining magical tools now? Our chamber of commerce personnel who remained here have acquired a large number of monster corpses, filling several storehouses. Elder Zou and the chamber's alchemists have categorized them, setting aside the parts suitable for refining pills like the Fiend Demon Pill and Bloodbone Pill.  More than half remain, requiring your expertise.  Everything is prepared on Redstone Mountain…"</p><p>Qin Sang, already prepared, readily agreed, "Please lead the way, Fellow Daoist Ran."</p><p>Refining tools on Allrock Island naturally meant using Redstone Mountain, especially for large-scale refining and alchemy.  A cultivator's own flame couldn't sustain such a massive undertaking.</p><p>Qin Sang preferred to keep his Nine Nether Demonic Fire concealed and needed earthfire as cover.</p><p>Renting fire chambers on the mountain was expensive, but the Jade Firmament Chamber of Commerce was footing the bill, so he wasn't about to save them money.</p><p>The two walked side by side, quickly arriving at Redstone Mountain.</p><p>Ascending Redstone Mountain, they felt the scorching heat of earthfire permeating the air.  Mortals wouldn't last long in this environment, quickly succumbing to dehydration.</p><p>Ran Luo led Qin Sang through a winding path, arriving at a stone wall halfway up the mountain.</p><p>An opening had been carved beneath the concealing stone wall, and several people were waiting there.</p><p>Elder Zou was among them.</p><p>Behind Elder Zou stood two figures. One was a kind-looking, white-bearded old man with a constant smile, who nodded amiably towards Qin Sang and Ran Luo.  </p><p>The other was a thin young man with a stern expression. Qin Sang keenly noticed the hostility hidden in the young man's gaze.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred as he recalled their identities.</p><p>Ran Luo had mentioned them before. The white-bearded elder was the chief alchemist recruited by Elder Zou, while the thin young man was a tool refiner.</p><p>"Stepping on someone's toes, it seems," Qin Sang thought, but remained unfazed by the young man's hostility.</p><p>Tool refining was ultimately a matter of skill. If he proved inferior, there was nothing to be said.  If his skills surpassed the young man's, the position of chief tool refiner would naturally be his.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you've arrived," Elder Zou greeted them, stepping aside to introduce the others. "This is Old Jia, an old friend of mine. He was planning to retire, but I dragged him back to help.  This is Fellow Daoist Zhuo, who hails from the renowned Sword Cauldron Sect and is quite famous throughout the East Sea region."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, "I am Qing Feng. Greetings, fellow Daoists."</p><p>He hadn't heard of the Sword Cauldron Sect, assuming it was a sect known for tool refining in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Zhuo, maintaining his composure, returned the greeting with a curious question, "From which sect does Fellow Daoist Qing Feng hail?  Elder Zou and Steward Ran have spoken highly of your skills. You must have unique insights into tool refining. Perhaps your sect has some connection to our Sword Cauldron Sect."</p><p>"I am a rogue cultivator," Qin Sang chuckled. "I happened upon a tool refining technique some time ago.  It likely has no relation to your esteemed sect…"</p><p>Zhuo didn't press the matter further.</p><p>Elder Zou produced a storage pouch and handed it to Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist, please take a look.  How many magical tools can you refine with the spiritual materials and monster corpses within?"</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense swept through the pouch, finding it filled with a rich assortment of materials.  Besides various spiritual materials, there were numerous beast bones and hides, including a complete spine that appeared to belong to a Flood Dragon.</p><p>After examining everything, Qin Sang pondered for a moment.  "With these materials, I should be able to refine five top-grade magical tools.  As for low-grade tools, it's hard to say, depending on how much material remains."</p><p>"Five?"  </p><p>Elder Zou and Old Jia exchanged glances, their eyes filled with delight.</p><p>The thin young man, however, was stunned, his face full of disbelief. He wouldn't dare attempt more than three top-grade magical tools to ensure a reasonable success rate. "Can you truly refine five top-grade magical tools with just these materials? Are you exaggerating?"</p><p>Qin Sang spoke with confidence, "Fellow Daoists, just wait a few days.  You'll see when I'm finished."</p><p>Elder Zou clapped his hands. "Excellent! The fire chamber is ready for you.  No one will disturb you during this time.  If you have any needs, just instruct the attendants. I await good news."</p><p>A guard emerged from within. Qin Sang bid farewell to the group and followed the guard into the cave dwelling, selecting a high-quality fire chamber.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang enter, Elder Zou smiled and turned to Ran Luo. "Fellow Daoist Qing Feng can refine five top-grade magical tools. Such skill is rare even in the entire East Pole Alliance.  It's a pity he doesn't refine magical treasures, but his skill is still remarkable.  We owe Steward Ran a great debt for recruiting him."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhuo told me earlier that he could only guarantee three top-grade magical tools. Fellow Daoist Qing Feng confidently claimed five.  He didn't seem to be boasting.  Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Zou, on acquiring such a talent."</p><p>Old Jia added his agreement.</p><p>The thin young man remained silent.  If Qin Sang could deliver on his promise, he would have to acknowledge his inferior skill and suppress any further dissatisfaction.</p><p>At that moment, the middle-aged man who had been observing coldly stepped forward. "Elder Zou, Steward Ran mentioned that this person has worn a cloak since the Sorcerer God Continent, never revealing his true face.  Could he be a fugitive from the Inner Sea?  If we don't investigate his identity, we might be implicated."</p><p>Elder Zou shook his head. "We've only invited Fellow Daoist Qing Feng to be an Outer Sea guest elder. Even if he committed heinous crimes in the Inner Sea, it has nothing to do with us. There's no need to worry.  In a few days, when Fellow Daoist Qing Feng emerges, we'll finalize his guest elder status. I will then visit other islands to inspect the chamber's businesses. Matters on Allrock Island are now in order.  Old Jia will oversee internal affairs, while Steward Ran will manage external affairs. I ask for your cooperation."</p><p>Everyone assented.</p>
