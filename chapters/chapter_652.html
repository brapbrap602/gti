Chapter 644: Nature's Gift


His heart finally calmed down.
Qin Sang murmured, “As expected, Blazing Gold is incredibly attractive to them. Fortunately, I had a backup plan.”
He wasn't reckless.  Scattering the Bloodwing Hornet larvae far and wide was a precaution. If a terrifyingly powerful spirit insect was attracted, he could detonate the larvae as an escape route.
Compared to chasing down an intruder, Blazing Gold was undoubtedly more important.
Spirit insects aren't highly intelligent and only make simple judgments like this.
Every spirit insect has a different temperament. Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure how effective Blazing Gold would be, as it's only useful to spirit insects on the verge of transformation.
Now it seemed he had underestimated its allure.
This method was viable, but the final outcome was beyond his control.
Qin Sang cursed the people who discovered the Gloom Eater. He wondered if the information was wrong or if the cave held a nest of Gloom Eaters instead of just one.
The Gloom Eater hadn't appeared before, only stirred by the Blazing Gold.
The Gloom Eater chasing him was terrifying.  It easily found the Sky Yaksha’s hiding spot and possessed frightening combat power, far exceeding Qin Sang's expectations, possibly late Stage Three Transformation.
Its attacks were undetectable, seemingly capable of disrupting spells.  He only felt them upon impact.
The Gloom Eater was discovered decades ago.
Qin Sang had assumed that even at its strongest, the Gloom Eater would only be at the initial Stage Three Transformation. He and the Sky Yaksha wouldn't need to worry.
Thankfully, he reacted quickly, detonating the larvae and diverting it. Otherwise, the Sky Yaksha might not have survived a third attack.
Qin Sang summoned the Sky Yaksha. Seeing its wounds, he felt a lingering fear.  He took out a Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle containing Earthly Yin energy and let it absorb the energy to heal.
Gazing towards the cave entrance, Qin Sang's expression flickered.
He decided to leave, abandoning the Gloom Eater.
With it there, the cave was extremely dangerous.
Qin Sang was no match for the Gloom Eater.
Even if he found help and captured it, it would be pointless.
The spirit insect control methods Qin Sang knew, whether from the Spirit Taming Sect's heritage or the Witch Tribe's Life Gu, required the cultivator's power to surpass the spirit insect's.
A Life Gu was out of the question.
To control this Gloom Eater using the Spirit Taming Sect's methods, he'd have to wait until it began its fourth transformation and seize the opportunity during its vulnerability.
In other words, Qin Sang needed to reach Nascent Soul stage.
If the Gloom Eater knew to consume Blazing Gold without refining it, absorbing its power at the start of its fourth transformation, its fate might change because of this sliver of Blazing Gold.
This was a true case of fortune arriving unexpectedly.
Qin Sang's expression was strange.  He had become a delivery boy.
Would it thank nature for its gift?
Luring the Gloom Eater only required a small amount of Blazing Gold, so Qin Sang's loss wasn't significant. However, this experience taught him a lesson: extreme caution was necessary when using Blazing Gold to lure spirit insects.
……
"The sixth one."
Qin Sang stood at the edge of a venomous swamp, massaging his temples with a headache.
After leaving the Gloom Eater's cave, Qin Sang visited four other locations without rest.
He was even more cautious now, first testing with insect-attracting incense, then using Bloodwing Hornet larvae as bait, trying various methods before resorting to Blazing Gold.
While luring, he and the Sky Yaksha kept their distance and planned escape routes.
Qin Sang spared no effort, traveling thousands of miles across various desolate lands, diligently searching four locations, all in vain.  Each time he focused all his energy, yet came up empty-handed. This left him exhausted and mentally fatigued.
However, this outcome was expected.
Spirit insects are highly sensitive to danger and migrate frequently.  The rumors were widespread, meaning many people knew about them, and they might have already been captured, especially those high on the Witch Insect List.
Qin Sang had Blazing Gold, but others might possess unique insect-luring methods as well.
Finding a suitable spirit insect was not easy.
This venomous swamp was the sixth location, rumored to house a Rainbow Ringed Earthworm.
The swamp was smaller than the Gloom Eater's wasteland. Multicolored poisonous mist hung above it, appearing even more vibrant under the sunlight, bringing to mind the bright fur of venomous beasts.
The swamp's mist was extremely potent. Deep within, even true energy couldn't withstand its corrosive effects.  It was a death zone that even Core Formation cultivators dared not enter.
Strangely, the swamp contained many spiritual herbs that could neutralize all poisons.  Therefore, cultivators would occasionally venture in, searching for these herbs.
Of course, they stayed at the edges, never daring to enter the swamp's core.
This Stage Two Transformation Rainbow Ringed Earthworm was discovered by herb gatherers.  Multiple people had witnessed it, with the latest sighting thirty years ago, making this information more reliable than the Gloom Eater's.
The Rainbow Ringed Earthworm possessed the bloodline of an ancient giant earthworm.  It thrived on poisonous gases and not only released a poisonous cloud but was also incredibly toxic throughout its body. Most wouldn't dare touch it.
The more colorful and vibrant its rings, the more potent its poison.
It was a good choice for a Life Gu. After its third transformation, its poison cloud would become invisible and odorless, easily affecting even Core Formation cultivators.
It was said that after its fourth transformation, it would gain an extremely rare Indestructible Body, a powerful ability coveted by countless body cultivators.
Of course, like other unique insects, cultivating it was exceptionally difficult.
Its toxicity made it hard to capture, so herb gatherers weren't interested in it.
Qin Sang prepared talismans to resist the poisonous mist and entered the swamp with the Sky Yaksha, stopping near the core. He didn't dare go deeper, choosing to set the bait there.
Due to the mist, the insect-attracting incense was ineffective.
Qin Sang released Bloodwing Hornet larvae but found that without his protection, they were instantly corroded by the mist.
Finally, he resorted to Blazing Gold directly.
Qin Sang understood the Rainbow Ringed Earthworm's nature.
Although toxic, the Sky Yaksha wasn't particularly vulnerable to it.
Its body, tempered by Earthly Yin energy, had significantly increased poison resistance.  Even if they encountered a late Stage Three Transformation Rainbow Ringed Earthworm this time, they wouldn't be as helpless.
However, Qin Sang remained cautious, fearing he might attract something other than the Earthworm.
Oddly, ordinary plants grew within the poisonous swamp, somehow adapting to the environment.
Since he couldn't use the larvae, Qin Sang smeared Blazing Gold on the trees and leaves, covering a large area.
Then, he and the Sky Yaksha climbed into the canopy, staring at the bubbling swamp below, waiting patiently.
