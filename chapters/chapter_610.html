<h1>Chapter 603  Tian Shan Mountain</h1><p>Chapter 603  Tian Shan Mountain</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to activate the green bronze piece, ultimately failing.</p><p>He grasped the piece and left the stone chamber.</p><p>Turning to look back, the small bird spirit puppet was still struggling in the South Ming Li Fire, its body mostly melted, extremely weak, its lifespan nearing its end.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding the green bronze piece, rose on his sword and returned the way he came.</p><p>This time, passing through the South Ming Li Fire, he felt a difference.</p><p>Holding the green bronze piece, he didn’t feel like he would be incinerated the next moment, as before. A faint warmth emanated from his palm, seemingly bearing the pressure of the fire.</p><p>Under the green light of the bronze piece, the South Ming Li Fire seemed to dim slightly.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang successfully passed through the South Ming Li Fire and landed on the ground.</p><p>The bird spirit puppet in the demonic fire let out a silent cry, turning to ash the moment Qin Sang landed.</p><p>Yun Youzi collapsed on the ground, drenched in sweat, nearly exhausted.  Manipulating the spirit array and the bird puppet had pushed him to his limit, even after he'd just recovered.</p><p>“This green bronze piece truly isn’t afraid of the South Ming Li Fire!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the piece, savoring the experience, secretly amazed.  However, aside from this one function, it seemed like just a worthless piece of scrap metal.</p><p>Even the once mighty Immortal Cauldron was irrelevant now, just a fragment.</p><p>“Senior, how are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang walked over, handed the bronze piece to Yun Youzi, and helped him up, reminding him, “This piece is very heavy, Senior, be careful.”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s eyes were filled with excitement. He took the bronze piece with both hands; his arms sank under its weight, and he placed it on the ground. He waved off Qin Sang's help, standing up on his own, saying, “Thank you for your help, Qin! How is the mark on your hand? I need to recuperate before I can act. Let me send you out first.”</p><p>Qin Sang raised his wrist. The cracks on the wooden bracelet had multiplied to seven or eight, and one dragon scale had shattered.</p><p>The bracelet wouldn't last much longer.</p><p>Qin Sang said no more, wished Yun Youzi success, and walked towards the passage's exit.</p><p>“Qin, until we meet again!”</p><p>Yun Youzi, in his Daoist robe, stood tall at the passage entrance, bowed to Qin Sang, smiled freely, “If this old Daoist fails, the next time you enter the Purple Micro Palace, offer a stick of incense for me. That will suffice!”</p><p>“Until we meet again!”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the respectful bow solemnly.</p><p>If Yun Youzi failed to be reborn from the flames, this would be their final farewell!</p><p>The passage slowly closed. Qin Sang stood there, watching Yun Youzi resolutely turn and walk towards the firelight.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Another crack appeared on the dragon-shaped bracelet, this time on the dragon's head; a whisker broke off and fell.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, then increased his speed, rushing towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p>On the way, he sorted through the items he’d acquired in the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Having traversed so many places and experienced so much, because the information was accurate, the time spent wasn't actually that long, most of it used for travel.</p><p>Qin Sang was afraid the bracelet would break mid-journey, revealing his location to Dongyang Bo, so he didn't dare to rest, not even a moment to catch his breath.</p><p>The Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and the follow-up cultivation methods for the "Chapter on Nurturing Swords with the Yuan Shen," his two goals for entering the Purple Micro Palace, had miraculously been achieved, and he'd also gained unexpected treasures.</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid went without saying; Qin Sang considered it the most precious item, crucial for the Du E Pill.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner had the potential to become a mid-grade magic treasure, and the corpse had a high chance of transforming into a true Flying Night Rakshasa, capable of fighting against early Foundation Establishment cultivators without losing.</p><p>These things together would pave a smooth road for him after Foundation Establishment, all the way to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The only drawback was the incomplete cultivation method, lacking the final stroke.</p><p>As Qin Sang descended the mountain, he summoned the Flying Night Rakshasa from the corpse puppet bag.</p><p>It was currently immobile; the chaos in its Yuan Shen continued. The transformation process was slower than Qin Sang had imagined, and might take some time.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had returned to the shore of the small lake. He put away the Flying Night Rakshasa, took out the compass Yun Youzi had given him, and entered the illusion array.</p><p>Since the array was an ancient ruin, it had many weak points.</p><p>Using the compass, Qin Sang quickly found a weak spot and approached it.</p><p>He put away the compass, checked himself to make sure he’d left no trace, crushed the bracelet in his hand, and stepped into the weak point.</p><p>He pretended to be bewildered and flustered, like a headless fly, crashing around in the array, unable to find a way out.</p><p>While Qin Sang was frantically searching, he suddenly felt a tightening sensation, realizing he was enveloped by a large shadow.  Startled, Qin Sang looked up and saw a gigantic hand effortlessly breaking through the illusionary array and reaching for him with lightning speed.</p><p>Qin Sang was helpless, grabbed by the hand and lifted up like a chick.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>In a flash, he found himself high in the air, having been plucked directly from the array.  Staggering to his feet, Qin Sang saw Dongyang Bo staring at him with a dark expression, his eyes blazing with anger.</p><p>Faced with a Nascent Soul master, the weight of his gaze was immense.  Qin Sang’s back instantly broke out in cold sweat.  He bowed and confessed, “Master, I beg your forgiveness! I was lost in the illusionary array, unable to find my way. I almost perished within, and I am grateful for your rescue. I have delayed your important affairs and am utterly unworthy of your grace…”</p><p>He had already anticipated Dongyang Bo's anger for the time he’d wasted on his own matters. However, Qin Sang’s excuse was plausible. The illusionary array had areas that could obscure the fluctuations of the markings. While few from the Central Continent entered the inner hall through the jade disc, and even fewer stumbled into the forbidden area, it wasn't entirely impossible.</p><p>By portraying it as an accident, and while he was still useful, Dongyang Bo, despite his anger, wouldn't lash out directly. After leaving the Purple Micro Palace and achieving Nascent Soul stage, his value would be different.  Dongyang Bo wouldn't likely hold a simple accident against him then.  Qin Sang considered this a worthwhile risk to anger Dongyang Bo for his future.</p><p>Qin Sang, his face full of fear, stammered an explanation.  Dongyang Bo’s gaze remained intense, fixed on Qin Sang for a moment, then on the illusionary array on the mountain. He coldly snorted, “This place is full of countless forbidden areas.  You’re lucky to be alive!”</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Dongyang Bo sent a wave of true energy that swept Qin Sang up, hurtling towards the Heavenly Mountains at incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not struggle as he was carried along, secretly relieved that he had managed to conceal the truth. Fortunately, Dongyang Bo had pressing matters and hadn't investigated further.  He just needed to flawlessly carry out Dongyang Bo’s instructions, and this would be over.</p><p>Dongyang Bo’s speed was phenomenal; the landscape below raced by at an astonishing pace. The distant Heavenly Mountains were soon within sight.</p>
