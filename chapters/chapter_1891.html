Chapter 1882: Defend Our Dao Lineage!


Daoist Zhang gazed at the celestial expanse, witnessing Venerable Tianyue ascend to the heavens, reaching for the moon.
Withdrawing his gaze, Daoist Zhang surveyed the Demonic Wasteland and the Demonic Sea. The first beat of the Demonic Summoning Drum had resounded, and he could already sense the oppressive atmosphere pervading this realm, encircling the Immortal Sects.
At this moment, the Dao Lineage had become an isolated island.
His face grave, Daoist Zhang exchanged a glance with Kundao from afar. His figure flickered, arriving above the Celestial Hub Academy's Decree Hall.
Figures flew towards the Decree Hall, all of them Lords of various departments within the Celestial Hub Academy, True People of the Dao Court.
However, these True People could only stand on the periphery.
Before this, within the Governance Altar, numerous golden halls, sealed for many years and whose ownership had been questioned by many, opened one after another.  From within emerged Grand True People, each possessing profound auras and cultivation as deep as the sea.
All of them were figures from legends, familiar to later generations.
Outside the Governance Altar, from the Ten Directions’ Sacred Grounds, Grand True People, who had been secluded in their temples and monasteries, were roused by the anomaly and emerged from their meditative chambers.
……
Pure Spring Abbey.
The abbey was hidden deep within the mountains, amidst swirling clouds and mist.
This mountain possessed a hundred spiritual springs, living up to the name 'Pure Spring.'
The abbey's pavilions and halls, like the surrounding environment, were elegant and refined, nestled among the trees without any sense of intrusion.
In the back mountains of Pure Spring Abbey, beside a spiritual spring, stood a courtyard and a thatched hut. Birds chirped merrily in the serene atmosphere.
On either side of the courtyard gate stood several wooden halls. Two young, refined female Daoists, seemingly seventeen or eighteen years old, sat in meditation before the wooden halls.
Suddenly, the door of the thatched hut opened, and a figure flashed out. It was True Person Ruoquan.
True Person Ruoquan’s cultivation had not yet fully recovered, remaining at the Profound Cave realm. She stood in mid-air, robes fluttering, glanced at the sky with a startled expression, and then soared towards the front of the mountain.
True Person Ruoquan did not conceal her movements. The two female Daoists outside were awakened. Seeing their Grandmaster emerge from seclusion, unaware of the reason, they hurriedly crushed the jade talismans in their hands.
Within the abbey at the front of the mountain, streaks of escaping light immediately ascended.
“Master…”
The current Abbess of Pure Spring Abbey flew to greet her. Her lips parted slightly, about to inquire, when True Person Ruoquan’s voice rang out, deep and solemn.
“Heaven and Earth are in upheaval. Activate the Sect Altar! Quickly summon all disciples!”
The Abbess dared not delay, obeying the order. Soon, the disciples of Pure Spring Abbey gathered at the Decree Hall, witnessing True Person Ruoquan standing before the Sect Altar with her hands clasped behind her back, seemingly waiting for something.
Similar scenes unfolded in various locations within the Dao Lineage’s twin Governance Centers.
……
Central Abundance Governance Center’s Governance Altar.
The True People gathered in the sky above the Decree Hall, below which lay the core of the Decree Hall, the true location of the Governance Altar!
Daoist Zhang landed before the main hall. The doors opened on their own.
The furnishings within were similar to those of the North Star Exorcism Academy's Decree Hall. Inside, there was also a Decree Bestowal Altar. However, the sacred image hanging at the back of the hall was not that of the 'Earthly Sovereign Empress,' but of the 'Celestial Emperor Gouchen of the Upper Palace.'
Daoist Zhang bowed respectfully to the sacred image, stepped onto the Decree Bestowal Altar, and sat cross-legged.
In the next moment, a sphere of light leapt from the altar, twisting and turning before Daoist Zhang. Occasionally, the outline of a Dharma Seal could be vaguely discerned within the light.
This seal was the Merit Seal of the Central Abundance Governance Center!
The Merit Seal had not yet reached its full potential, its form not solidified, hence its appearance before the world in this state.
At some point, a square seal had appeared in Daoist Zhang’s hand. Holding the square seal, he pressed it against the sphere of light, leaving a vermillion imprint, which then flashed into the interior of the sphere.
In the next moment, the entire Decree Hall began to tremble violently. The dome of the Decree Hall seemed to vanish as the Merit Seal emitted a cyan beam of light that shot straight into the clouds.
Simultaneously, all the Pacification Altars, Capital Altars, Branch Altars under the Celestial Hub Academy, as well as the Sect Altars of various temples, monasteries, and sects throughout the land, resonated in response.
“I, Zhang Haichan, Supreme Lord of the Nine Heavens Golden阙, Minister of the Celestial Hub Academy. Now, holding the Seal of the Upper Clarity Celestial Hub Academy, I decree to all Immortal Officials of the Dao Court and Masters of Temples and Monasteries: Obey this decree and act accordingly. There must be no delay!”
“This is truly a moment of life and death for the Dao Lineage…”
Daoist Zhang's voice resounded through the Decree Hall, transmitted through the Merit Seal of the Central Abundance Governance Center, reaching every altar within the realm.
The True People outside the Decree Hall, and the True People and Daoists waiting at the various altars, all listened with solemn expressions to the True Monarch's decree.
“I implore all True People, defend our Dao Lineage!”
The final sentence, uttered with a suddenly heightened tone, stirred the hearts and ignited the blood of all who heard it.
“We obey the decree!”
The True People outside the Decree Hall responded with a resounding roar.
……
Pure Spring Abbey.
True Person Ruoquan turned to face the disciples behind her. Some were familiar, some unfamiliar. Some were at the True Person realm like the Abbess, while others were newly initiated, their cultivation still low.
Their expressions varied: some calm, some apprehensive…
“You,” True Person Ruoquan raised a jade-like finger, pointing at the Abbess, and then at several others.
“You remain here!”
“Master!”
The Abbess, greatly alarmed, stepped forward but was stopped by a wave of True Person Ruoquan's hand.
True Person Ruoquan slightly raised her beautiful head, a strange light flickering in her eyes. “With the Divine Court’s emergence, someone must preside over the Sect Altar and await the Imperial Decree. Rest assured, there will be a role for you later. Other disciples of Pure Spring Abbey, follow me out of the mountains to slay demons and defend the Dao!”
Hearing her Master's unquestionable tone, the Abbess dared not argue. She could only stand aside, her face filled with worry, watching as True Person Ruoquan led a group of disciples and flew out of the mountains.
Streaks of escaping light flew out of Pure Spring Abbey, like a meteor shower across the night sky, heading east.
Their destination was the nearest Dao Court Capital Altar.
Small Shifting Formations were mostly set up in Immortal Cities under the Dao Court's jurisdiction, and most Dao Lineage temples and monasteries were built around these cities.
This was partly due to the Dao Court's will, and partly because the locations chosen by the Dao Court were the most suitable sacred grounds for cultivation.
At this moment, if someone were to look down from the sky, they would see countless streaks of escaping light interweaving across the Dao Lineage's twin Governance Centers, shrouded in night, forming a vast net that covered the land.
These lights were like tributaries converging towards the main artery.
……
Within the Governance Altar.
The True People dispersed, but some remained, including two Grand True People.
The doors of the Decree Hall slowly closed. After the True Monarch issued the decree, there was silence.
The two Grand True People each selected a group of followers, one heading south, the other north.
They exchanged a glance across the Decree Hall, summoned their flying altars, and traversed the Heavenly Stems. Other True People and Daoists surrounded the Grand True People, forming formations and performing techniques, changing their formations according to the Grand True People's罡 steps and hand seals.
From a distance, they resembled two constantly shifting talisman diagrams.
Incantations chanted by the Grand True People continuously echoed from within the formations. Divine talismans materialized in the air, then were launched towards various locations within the Governance Altar.
‘Rumble!’
The Governance Altar trembled incessantly, spiritual light erupting from all directions.
Beams of spiritual light connected in the sky, finally converging inwards through the hands of the two Grand True People, merging into one, resembling a giant altar suspended above the Governance Altar.
Similar scenes played out in the White Stone Governance Center.
……
While the Grand True People presiding over the Governance Altar were busy, other Grand True People had already led True People and Dao Court troops to the city's Shifting Grand Hall.
Figures swarmed above the Shifting Grand Hall, a vast, boundless, dark mass. Streaks of escaping light continuously converged here from outside the city.
Even during the Dao Court’s most perilous times, there had never been such an astonishing sight.
Seemingly chaotic, yet under the Dao Court's guidance, the teleportation proceeded in an orderly manner.
Figures continuously poured into the Immortal Cities at the north and south ends of the Dao Lineage’s twin Governance Centers.
If this realm were considered as two parts, one land, one sea, the Four Governance Centers were located at the juncture of land and sea, occupying a part of the land that jutted outwards, arranged in a line along the coastline.
The north faced the Demonic Wasteland’s ferocious beasts, while the south faced threats from the sea.
Even though the ferocious beasts rarely attacked them proactively, the Dao Lineage had to guard against the Ghost Fang Nation beating the Demonic Summoning Drum, and preparations had long been made.
The layout of the Immortal Cities at the north and south ends within the twin Governance Centers concealed a profound design, specifically to defend against this day!
The Dao Court’s army marched mightily towards this area. However, relatively few were sent to the Yellow Springs Path, which faced direct confrontation with the Ghost Fang Nation. Instead, troops were redeployed to other fronts.
The Demon Saint had dispatched most of its elite forces to the Saint’s Mansion to prevent the Dao Court’s True Monarchs from seizing the Demonic Summoning Drum.
As for the demons within the Yellow Springs Path, the stationed armies could handle them. They did not need to attack proactively, but only needed to form formations to block the demons, preventing them from breaking through into the heartland of the Dao Lineage.
Unfortunately, in such haste, the Dao Court could only manage this much.
Cultivators of the Mount Ju Governance Center also received the True Monarch’s decree through the Sect Altars, learning of the impending upheaval.
With the Dao Court stretched thin, they had to rely on themselves.
Fortunately, the Demon Kingdoms of Mount Ju also needed to protect themselves and had not joined the Ghost Fang Nation's madness. Moreover, the Dao Court was not entirely unprepared.
Crane Cry Mountain.
The Yin Heaven Palace spared no effort, activating its sect-protecting formation, all its experts emerging.
Star Island Immortal Lake.
Both the Left and Right Thunder Palaces unleashed thunder, shaking the eight directions.
……
True Person Xun stood alone on a mountaintop in the north of the White Stone Governance Center. Behind him came inspiring shouts.
“Defend our Dao Lineage!”
“Defend our Dao Lineage!”
……
The voices shook Heaven and Earth.
True Person Xun gazed northwards. The Demonic Wasteland’s black clouds pressed down like a city, the night impenetrable, demonic Qi soaring into the sky. He couldn’t help but sigh softly, a trace of worry flashing in his eyes.
At this moment, a streak of escaping light flew from afar, landing behind True Person Xun. A young-looking Daoist appeared.
The young Daoist bowed respectfully and spoke rapidly: “The formations of all cities have been activated, supporting each other like horns. Fellow Daoists have also dispersed outside the cities, trying to bring as many mortals into the cities as possible. However…”
The young Daoist’s face revealed a trace of unbearable pain as he continued with difficulty, “The beast tide is approaching. If the Ghost Fang Nation relentlessly beats the Demonic Summoning Drum, we cannot possibly bring all mortals into the Immortal Cities…”
“Do what we can, leave the rest to fate,” True Person Xun said indifferently.
These words sounded cruel but were born of helplessness.
The events unfolded abruptly. The demons had made their desperate gamble, and the Dao Lineage itself was barely holding on. How much more could they do to save the mortals?
The young Daoist’s lips moved, wanting to speak but hesitating.
Noticing this, True Person Xun frowned and snapped, “Spit it out! What else do you have to say!”
The young Daoist steeled his resolve and knelt on one knee. “Forgive my impertinence, but why haven’t we seen the True Monarch’s presence?”
True Person Xun snorted coldly, “The True Monarch cannot be easily mobilized!”
Before he finished speaking, True Person Xun suddenly felt something, abruptly raising his head. He saw two white rainbows shooting out from the Lunar Palace.
Within the white rainbows were two sword shadows, one south, one north, slashing towards the Demonic Sea and the Demonic Wasteland, respectively.
At this moment, within the Four Governance Centers, whether cultivator or demon cultivator, all could see these two sword shadows that seemed to cleave the heavens.
True Person Xun watched the sword shadow flying north. Although he strained his Dharma Eyes, he could not see the true form of the sword shadow.
He knew this was because the sword intent contained within the sword shadow was too powerful. He couldn't help but feel secretly alarmed.
The sword shadow was clearly not aimed at him, merely whistling past high in the sky, yet he felt a twinge of fear and trepidation, the hairs on his body standing on end.
He had personally witnessed the True Monarch make a move before, but this was the first time he had felt this way.
“What realm is this Sword-Wielding True Person? Could his cultivation be even higher than the two True Monarchs?”
True Person Xun had already learned of the Sword-Wielding True Person from the True Monarch, but he hadn’t expected this person’s strength to be so astonishing.
‘Whoosh!’
The sword shadow traversed the sky and entered the Demonic Wasteland.
The drumming from the Ghost Fang Nation’s Saint's Mansion was as loud as thunder, beat after beat, urgent and rapid.
From the depths of the Demonic Wasteland came continuous roars.
Countless terrifying figures, wrapped in demonic clouds, surged south. The mountain where True Person Xun stood was directly in the path of the vanguard of the beast tide.
True Person Xun’s eyes shone with divine light, his gaze piercing through the demonic clouds.
Behind the beast tide was a terrifying aura rapidly approaching, belonging to a True Monarch level ferocious beast.
Cultivators who had participated in the battle at the Mount Ju Governance Altar would find it familiar. It was the ferocious beast that had manifested as gray lightning.
The beast had been injured by the True Monarch after being drawn by the Demonic Summoning Drum that year.  Apparently, it hadn’t learned its lesson and was causing trouble again.
Facing a True Monarch level ferocious beast, even True Person Xun, whose cultivation was second only to the True Monarch, couldn’t suppress the tension in his heart. He clenched his fists, watching the movements of the sword shadow.
The sword shadow seemed to sense the aura of the ferocious beast and shifted slightly, traversing the void towards it.
As it flew across the sky, the sword tip revealed its sharp edge. By the time it reached the demonic clouds, the sword shadow had left a ten-thousand-zhang long streak of sword light in the void.
The sword light slashed diagonally into the demonic cloud.
Wherever it passed, the demonic clouds dissipated, countless ferocious beasts perishing without any ability to resist.
Beast blood stained the earth crimson.
The sword light split the beast tide, its momentum unabated, striking the center of the gray lightning without deviation.
‘Boom!’
The sword light cut a fissure through the center of the gray lightning, as if to pierce straight through it.
“Roar!”
A shrill scream erupted from within the gray lightning.
In the next moment, the gray lightning solidified, then shattered into pieces. A pangolin-like ferocious beast tumbled out from the void, screaming as it retreated, blood spraying across the sky.
True Person Xun’s eyes widened in disbelief. A mere sword shadow, a single sword strike, had injured a True Monarch level ferocious beast.
After the sword strike, the roars from the Demonic Wasteland suddenly lessened considerably.
The sword shadow hung upside down in the sky, its edge gleaming.  The demonic clouds seemed to hesitate.
Not only that, the other sword shadow flying towards the Demonic Sea similarly slashed into the storm, reaping the lives of countless ferocious beasts, staining the sea red with blood.
On the sea surface, a ferocious beast resembling a wild ox pawed the waves restlessly, roaring at the sword shadow.
One sword stemmed the demonic clouds, one sword broke the storm!
Venerable Tianyue’s true body still stood before the Southern Heavenly Gate, single-handedly blocking the Demon Saint’s path.
The Star-Breaking Divine Sword stood in the void, its divine light brilliant.
Having unleashed two sword shadows, seemingly at great cost, Venerable Tianyue’s face was pale. He did not use the Star-Breaking Divine Sword again, but waved his hand, summoning his natal spirit sword.
‘Hum!’
The sword transformed into thousands, all pointing towards the five-clawed golden dragon.
He was actually going to protect the Dao Lineage single-handedly!
……
Celestial Hub Academy, Decree Hall.
True Monarch Zhang sat cross-legged on the Decree Bestowal Altar, his gaze penetrating the hall, pausing momentarily on Venerable Tianyue before continuing upwards.
Passing through the Divine Court, his gaze reached beyond the Nine Heavens.
In the depths of the starry sky, strange ripples arose. The galaxy was shrouded in shadow, the starlight flickering unsteadily, as if the heavens were about to shatter.
He closed his eyes, both hands gripping the Merit Seal of the Central Abundance Governance Center.
In the next moment, wind and thunder raged around the Governance Altar. The spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth transformed into a spiritual tide, surging madly into the Decree Hall. (End of Chapter)
