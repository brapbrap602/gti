<h1>Chapter 1110: Secluded Cultivation</h1><p>After successfully obtaining their objective, the two immediately distanced themselves from the Corpse King's lair. They smoothly exited the Immortal Tomb, traversed the Vulture Mountain, and arrived at the palace complex at the entrance of the Purple Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang found a secluded courtyard at the entrance and quietly waited for the immortal formation to stabilize. Before long, a series of whooshing sounds came from deep within the palace. Startled, Qin Sang leaned out to look and was surprised to find a large group of cultivators arriving together. These cultivators did not conceal their auras, and among them were several Nascent Soul Ancestors!</p><p>"So many Nascent Soul Ancestors traveling together in the Purple Palace?" Qin Sang was astonished. Recalling the confrontation outside the Demon Cave, he realized that the situation in the cultivation world might have undergone a significant change.</p><p>The cultivators headed straight for the entrance of the Purple Palace. Fortunately, the palace complex was vast, and Qin Sang discreetly hid in a corner, avoiding any chance encounters with old enemies. He carefully retreated, suppressing his aura, and silently waited.</p><p>Soon, other cultivators began to gather sporadically. Finally, the fluctuations in the sea of clouds within the immortal formation began to weaken until the clouds stagnated, and the entire Purple Palace started to tremble, about to descend into the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>In an instant, beams of light shot into the sky. Not wanting to be left behind, Qin Sang activated his protective treasure and rushed into the sea of clouds. The dangers he had faced when entering the Purple Palace were still vivid in his mind, but leaving was much safer.</p><p>Qin Sang smoothly passed through the immortal formation and finally returned to the familiar Ancient Immortal Battlefield! The spiritual tide had not yet completely subsided, and the battlefield was in chaos. The Purple Palace, located deep within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, was as dangerous as the storm belts at the periphery of the two great seas.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the ground, his feet touching the desert. He glanced back at the swirling vortex of wind and clouds, not wanting to interact with anyone here, and immediately distanced himself from the area. Before flying out of the Purple Palace, he had already summoned the Moonview Rhinoceros Horn, a treasure that could still guide him in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, ensuring he wouldn't get lost.</p><p>No one noticed Qin Sang leaving alone. The spiritual tide's power was not as formidable as before, and Qin Sang maneuvered and dodged, successfully flying out of the desert. Then, spatial rifts began to appear in the void, causing his heart to race.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and, with the help of its divine ability, headed towards the Seven Heroes Pass. He traveled alone through the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, his speed varying as he frequently detoured to avoid dangers. After several days, he finally noticed that the spatial rifts were becoming sparse, and the spiritual tide's intensity was weakening day by day.</p><p>At this moment, he unexpectedly discovered a strange phenomenon deep within the mountains ahead. Multicolored lights flickered intermittently, resembling the signs of a secret realm emerging. The speed of Nascent Soul Ancestors was certainly far superior to Qin Sang's, but since he had deliberately taken a detour, no one should have discovered this phenomenon before him.</p><p>Qin Sang traversed mountains and ridges, arriving at a bare stone mountain. The strange light was emanating from within the mountain, seeping through the cracks in the rocks. After a brief investigation, Qin Sang confirmed that this light was the manifestation of a secret realm's restriction, stimulated by the spiritual tide, revealing a flaw and thus appearing in the world.</p><p>However, rather than a secret realm, it seemed more like a cave dwelling, filled with a decaying aura. After some exploration and finding no treasures, Qin Sang cast a spell to clean up the cave dwelling, repaired the restriction, and concealed the phenomenon. He decided to seclude himself here for a while.</p><p>Since entering the Seven Slaughter Hall, there had been constant turmoil and numerous changes, leaving him no time to catch his breath. He needed to thoroughly sort out his experiences. Additionally, various signs indicated that significant changes had occurred in the cultivation world here. He needed to carefully consider what to do and how to proceed upon his return.</p><p>Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag. Qin Sang asked, "Do you have any clues about the Corpse Soul Pearl?"</p><p>Bai flipped his hand, revealing a round pearl in his palm—the Corpse Soul Pearl of the Corpse King. After Qin Sang helped Bai severely injure the Corpse King, Bai attempted to subdue it but failed, ultimately having to kill the Corpse King and take its Corpse Soul Pearl.</p><p>The Corpse Soul Pearl is formed when a refined corpse achieves the status of a Corpse King, with its essence merging into the Corpse Core, eventually transforming into something akin to a cultivator's Nascent Soul. The surface of the pearl was a dark greenish-black, flowing with an alluring luster, and occasionally, mysterious runes would appear—restrictions Bai had placed on the pearl. Inside the pearl, corpse energy condensed, swirling like clouds, sometimes revealing a terrifying, grotesque face that snarled silently at the two, trying to break free.</p><p>The Corpse Soul Pearl was extremely rare. Neither Qin Sang nor Bai knew how to refine it. Bai gently shook his head, hesitating, "The Heavenly Corpse Talisman has merged with its essence into the Corpse Soul Pearl. I dare not act recklessly; it will likely take more than a day to achieve. However, if I can refine this Corpse Soul Pearl, even if I can't fully comprehend the secrets of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, I should still have a chance to break through to the Corpse King level..."</p><p>Qin Sang was pleased, "At least our efforts weren't in vain! After we return, once you achieve the Corpse King level, we can work together to search for the ruins of the Heavenly Corpse Sect. We're bound to uncover something."</p><p>Bai chose a stone chamber to seclude himself in. Qin Sang sealed the restriction, and silence fell over the cave dwelling.</p><p>Inside the cave, Qin Sang extended his divine sense into the Thousand Jun Ring, examining his gains one by one. The Nine-Life Mystic Turtle Shell was temporarily lent to Bai as a shield. Qin Sang felt that refining the shell into a mere defensive treasure would be a waste. The shell contained extremely pure Mystic Water energy, and Qin Sang had a vague idea that he needed to further study artifact refining after forming his Nascent Soul to determine its feasibility.</p><p>Before him appeared four items: a transparent lotus seed, fragments of the Slaughter Sword, and two jade slips. The Slaughter Sword fragments showed no change from a few days ago, and the sword spirit's awakening time was uncertain. Qin Sang examined them briefly before storing them away.</p><p>Next, his gaze fell on the transparent lotus seed. The seed carried the "Seed of Golden Lotus." Qin Sang's decision to seclude himself here was largely related to this treasure. He had hastily condensed the fire seed without time to thoroughly comprehend the "Seed of Golden Lotus," nor had he used the lotus seed, fearing it might leave some hidden flaws.</p><p>Picking up the transparent lotus seed, Qin Sang activated his divine sense, simultaneously comprehending the secret technique and erasing Elder Mo's mark. Time passed unnoticed in the cave dwelling.</p><p>After two full months, Qin Sang awoke from his meditation. He gazed at the lotus seed for a while but did not absorb it into his body, instead returning it to the Thousand Jun Ring. During this time, he had comprehended the "Seed of Golden Lotus" and examined the lotus seed. He ultimately confirmed that the seed's functions were indeed limited to two: recording the secret technique and serving as an aid during the initial stages of cultivation to prevent the cultivator from self-immolation. Beyond that, it had no other uses.</p><p>He now realized that once he refined the fire lotus seed to a certain extent, it would reach its limit. Absorbing more Nine Nether Demon Fire into his body would be unsustainable. Neither the Jade Buddha nor the lotus seed could help him; it was a matter of insufficient cultivation. Clearly, the "Seed of Golden Lotus" was not meant for Golden Core cultivators. To progress further, he would need to form his Nascent Soul.</p><p>At this level, the fire lotus seed's power was insufficient, and the boost to his divine sense was minimal. For now, the "Seed of Golden Lotus" could only serve as an auxiliary technique for controlling the Demon Banner.</p>
