<h1>Chapter 622: Stormy Demon Sea</h1><p>“Medicine meets Qi, form takes shape, Dao harmonizes, nature prevails. A golden core swallowed, destiny defied.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi bowed deeply, his voice laced with envy and a touch of sorrow, finally culminating in a congratulatory message, "Congratulations, Senior, on forming your core."</p><p>Qin Sang looked remarkably young, about twenty years old, while Cui Xuanzi's hair was as white as snow.</p><p>If ordinary mortals witnessed this scene, they would be astonished, expecting the opposite to be true.</p><p>But in the cultivation world, where strength reigns supreme, this was perfectly normal.</p><p>"A nascent Gold Core merely loosens some shackles. The immortal path remains arduous, teeming with powerful figures. I dare not claim to defy destiny."</p><p>A faint smile touched Qin Sang's lips. He recalled the Nightfiend and glanced towards where the Five Venom Sect disciples had departed. "Is your sect's Gold Core cultivator available? I've just formed my core and have many questions. I wish to visit and discuss the Dao with them."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's eyes flickered, his voice unwavering as he explained, "Senior Qin, my Martial Uncle embarked on a journey shortly after forming his Gold Core. It's unclear if he's still in the Western Frontier. I heard he's invited fellow cultivators to hunt demons in the Stormy Demon Sea. He likely won't return soon. If you can stay longer, I'll send him a message."</p><p>Earlier, Cui Xuanzi, observing Qin Sang's demeanor despite commanding a Nightfiend, found him amicable, not a bloodthirsty fiend. His worries had lessened.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang mention a Gold Core cultivator, Cui Xuanzi's heart tightened again.</p><p>The Five Venom Sect did have a Gold Core cultivator, Cui Xuanzi's Martial Uncle.</p><p>But that Martial Uncle had left on a journey shortly after Cui Xuanzi became sect leader. Now, Cui Xuanzi was nearing the end of his life, and his Martial Uncle remained unheard from, with no soul lamp left behind.</p><p>They didn't even know if he was alive or dead.</p><p>Outsiders, unaware of this, could invoke his name, using it as a deterrent. Cui Xuanzi wouldn't volunteer this information to Qin Sang.</p><p>Stormy Demon Sea…</p><p>Qin Sang encountered another new place name, seemingly similar to the Demon Mound, likely a demonic territory.</p><p>However, Gold Core cultivators hunting demons there suggested the relationship between the demons of the Stormy Demon Sea and cultivators wasn't as harmonious as in the Demon Mound.</p><p>"Forget it. I came to the Western Frontier seeking spirit insects suitable for my Natal Gu. I hear the Western Frontier wilderness teems with rare spirit insects. Forming my core here was unexpected. I won't stay in your Bear Mountain region long."</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized Cui Xuanzi. His sharp eyes discerned falsehoods in Cui Xuanzi's words, but he didn't probe further. He waved his hand, saying, "Since that cultivator is absent, no need to trouble yourself."</p><p>Unexpectedly, before he finished, Qin Sang noticed Cui Xuanzi staring at him in astonishment, as if he'd heard something unbelievable.</p><p>"Senior formed your Gold Core… without choosing a Natal Gu?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was incredulous.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Cui Xuanzi's reaction implied the Natal Gu aided core formation.</p><p>After conversing with Yuan Hu,</p><p>Qin Sang learned of the deep-seated animosity and past wars between the Wu and Human races.</p><p>Now, the Wu, driven to the Wu God Continent, harbored even greater resentment towards humans. Even Yuan Hu, who had never left Bear Mountain, felt this. Qin Sang decided maintaining his Wu disguise was best.</p><p>Fortunately, his interactions revealed little outward difference between the Wu and Human races.</p><p>The Wu called cultivators Wu God Envoys and had peculiar customs.</p><p>But in dealing with Yuan Hu and Cui Xuanzi, these customs seemed diluted. Their behavior differed little from human cultivators, requiring minimal adjustment from Qin Sang.</p><p>Only the village shamans and priests fully retained their bizarre customs.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected this was for maintaining control and their status among mortals.</p><p>The Wu feared the Wu God Envoys' power yet staunchly believed in the Wu God. Faith, seemingly ethereal, could be incredibly potent.</p><p>Wu cultivators excelled in insect control, even refining spirit insects into Natal Gu.</p><p>He wondered what path the human cultivators here followed, if it resembled the Wu.</p><p>A thought flashed through his mind, and Qin Sang calmly said, "I cultivated in seclusion for many years, never finding a suitable Natal Gu, hence the delay. Recently, facing a bottleneck in core formation, I ventured out to seek suitable spirit insects and gain experience. Unexpectedly, inspiration struck mid-journey, and I formed my core. I didn't anticipate it myself."</p><p>Qin Sang lied effortlessly.</p><p>Inwardly, he scoffed, "If only you knew the trials I endured to form my core!"</p><p>"Senior's talent is unparalleled…"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was astounded, shaking his head repeatedly. "Forming a core without a Natal Gu… even the direct disciples of the great sects outside the Western Frontier can't compare… Senior, during your travels in the Western Frontier, if you have any needs, just command. I and my disciples will do our utmost."</p><p>Discovering Qin Sang lacked a Natal Gu further solidified Cui Xuanzi's belief in his extraordinary background. He desired to form a connection, hoping for future benefits.</p><p>With Qin Sang's thick skin, he naturally didn't blush.</p><p>Hearing Cui Xuanzi's words, his curiosity deepened.</p><p>Did Wu cultivators, unlike those in the Small Cold Region, rely on Natal Gu instead of various pills and treasures for core formation?</p><p>Qin Sang eyed Cui Xuanzi with amusement, chuckling softly, "If I wished to peruse your sect's secret techniques, would you agree?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's expression shifted, surprised Qin Sang coveted their techniques.</p><p>His background must be extraordinary. What could their small sect's inheritance offer him?</p><p>"Senior is jesting, right? Cultivation methods in the Western Frontier are largely similar. My sect's inheritance is rudimentary, unlikely to interest Senior," Cui Xuanzi forced a smile.</p><p>Qin Sang said flatly, "Would I joke about such matters? Drawing parallels and learning widely, anything benefiting my cultivation interests me. Your sect, standing in the Western Frontier, dominating Bear Mountain, and producing a Gold Core cultivator, must have its strengths. Lending it for study might grant me insights. Of course, I won't force the issue…"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi inwardly groaned, regretting mentioning his Martial Uncle.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang retrieved an item from his Qianjun Ring, displaying it to Cui Xuanzi.</p><p>"If you're willing, I can trade this for it."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi focused, seeing a talisman, slightly puzzled.</p><p>Upon recognizing it, his face registered shock, "A Talisman Treasure?"</p>
