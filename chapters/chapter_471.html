<h1>Chapter 464: Detaining the Stone</h1><p>Many orbs of light were entangled with the barrier, inseparable.</p><p>Forcefully removing these Star Origin Stones would disturb the delicate balance, potentially causing unknown changes to the barrier.</p><p>Time was limited, and Elder Jing struggled to stabilize the barrier, warning Qin Sang against any unnecessary actions. If the spatial structure of Sky Point Peak collapsed, they would all perish.</p><p>No wonder Vice-Island Master Xiao hadn't mentioned this before. The Spirit Locking Bracelet alone couldn't retrieve the Star Origin Stones entangled with the barrier. Only the Star Net could.</p><p>"Enter here."</p><p>Elder Jing didn't choose the seemingly safest path along the waterfall to ascend and leave the grassland.</p><p>Instead, she pointed towards a stone path leading into the forest. Seeing Qin Sang's hesitation, she said calmly, "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist Han. I'll guide you through the barrier. The Star Origin Stones we collect along the way will be enough for you to surpass the others."</p><p>The forest was dimly lit, deathly silent, and somewhat eerie.</p><p>But it wasn't quiet. Multicolored light specks danced within, like countless spirits, but they were actually fluctuations from barrier fragments.</p><p>The radiant light on the treetops was merely a part of the barrier fragments within the forest. They were everywhere. Because of these barriers, navigating the forest was extremely difficult.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang chose to trust Elder Jing.</p><p>Just before entering the forest, Qin Sang looked up as far as he could.</p><p>Sky Point Peak was far taller than he had imagined. Its majestic silhouette pierced the clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely saw a peak resembling a soaring hawk. This was one of the few landmarks on Sky Point Peak that Vice-Island Master Xiao had mentioned.</p><p>Seeing Hawk Peak from here meant he was likely on the upper slopes of Sky Point Peak.</p><p>Truthfully, his luck wasn't the best.</p><p>The distribution of light orbs on Sky Point Peak followed a pattern. The closer to the summit, the more numerous and dangerous the orbs became.</p><p>The barriers and terrain there were more perilous and complex, but there were also many unentangled orbs that were easier to collect.</p><p>Unlike here, where the vast grassland held not a single orb.</p><p>One hour was neither short nor long.</p><p>Judging by the surrounding terrain, without Elder Jing and the Star Net, Qin Sang had a chance to obtain a reward, but to strive for first place, he had to steel his resolve and enter the forest, disregarding his own safety.</p><p>Collecting Star Origin Stones one by one within the gaps of the barrier was his only hope.</p><p>Of course, there was another way, provided he encountered others.</p><p>He stepped into the forest.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision suddenly brightened. His face was bathed in half red and half blue light.</p><p>The source of the light was the shimmering glow between two ancient trees ahead. The red and blue light pressed against each other, yet didn't merge, forming a distinct dividing line.</p><p>They seemed to regard each other as enemies, unwilling to yield, yet bound within this space, they could only push against each other. Sometimes the blue light prevailed, sometimes the red light swallowed a piece of the blue.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to the two-colored shimmer. Elder Jing's voice rang out, "Collect the Star Origin Stones above."</p><p>Looking up, Qin Sang noticed five orbs floating among the branches of the two ancient trees.</p><p>His luck wasn't bad. Three of them floated at the edge of the two-colored shimmer.</p><p>The other two were embedded in the gap between the two colors, swaying with the shimmer.</p><p>"Don't touch the middle two," Elder Jing added.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The two orbs in the middle were deeply intertwined with the barrier. Removing them would likely trigger a violent conflict between the two colors.</p><p>He gently raised his palm. The silken threads in his palm shot towards the branches, rapidly unfolding into a fine net after leaving his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang had already refined the Star Net to respond to his will. After quickly completing the hand seals, the Star Net approached the three orbs, expanding into a large net, perfectly enveloping them.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Star Net flared brightly, unhesitatingly pouncing on the three orbs.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's precise control, the Star Net avoided touching the two-colored shimmer.</p><p>The orbs were intangible, merely pure starlight condensed from Star Origin Power. Without specialized artifacts like the Star Net or Spirit Locking Bracelet, one would simply pass through them.</p><p>It would be impossible to condense them into Star Origin Stones.</p><p>The moment they were enveloped by the Star Net, the starlight fluctuated, attempting to resist or escape, but it couldn't break free from the net's restraints.</p><p>The Spirit Locking Bracelet could only capture one orb at a time, and its power was far inferior to the Star Net.  Even suppressing a single orb was strenuous, requiring the user's full assistance.</p><p>If the orb couldn't be suppressed, one had to abandon it immediately. Otherwise, if the barrier was triggered during the orb's resistance, the fragile Spirit Locking Bracelet wouldn't withstand the impact.</p><p>Even with the Star Net, Qin Sang had to be extremely careful when encountering resistance from the orbs.</p><p>Fortunately, his control was excellent. He successfully restrained all three orbs without incident.</p><p>Under the continuous pressure of the Star Net, the orbs' resistance weakened, their size shrinking as the starlight compressed inwards.</p><p>Gradually, the orbs transformed into small, irregular crystal beads.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>The Star Net, carrying the three similar-sized crystal beads, flew back to Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>These were the Star Origin Stones.</p><p>Called stones, they were actually beads.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill in his palm. The Star Origin Stones were light, like willow catkins, almost weightless, yet incredibly hard. Even squeezing them with all his might couldn't shatter them.</p><p>Sweeping his divine sense over the Star Origin Stones, Qin Sang only sensed an indescribable etherealness, a unique quality he'd never encountered before.</p><p>These could be used to set up formations?</p><p>Curiosity arose within Qin Sang, but he knew it wasn't the time to examine them. He immediately stored them in the special pouch provided by Stargazing Island, gripped the Star Net, and turned to Elder Jing.</p><p>From deploying the Star Net to capturing the Star Origin Stones, only a few breaths had passed. The speed was astonishing, far exceeding the fragile Spirit Locking Bracelet's efficiency.</p><p>Thinking of the two spiritual objects waiting for him outside, Qin Sang felt immensely pleased.</p><p>Elder Jing, already aware of the Star Net's capabilities, showed no emotion.  Her gaze fixed on the gap between the two-colored shimmer, she raised a jade finger. "Enter here!"</p><p>The time was too short. Qin Sang couldn't discern the nature of this barrier fragment, so he could only follow Elder Jing's command.</p><p>The ancient trees in the forest weren't densely packed, with paths leading in all directions. Yet, Elder Jing chose the most dangerous route.</p><p>If she wanted to harm me, there would be no need for such elaborate measures!</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. Without hesitation, he obeyed Elder Jing's command. His figure flickered, transforming into a streak of light as he rushed into the gap between the two-colored shimmer.</p><p>At that moment, two terrifying pressures suddenly appeared on either side of Qin Sang. If this pressure landed on him, his protective robe wouldn't last a moment, and he would be instantly crushed.</p><p>Fortunately, the instant he sensed the pressure, Qin Sang had already passed through the gap in the two-colored shimmer, emerging on the other side.</p>
