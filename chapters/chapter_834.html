<h1>Chapter 826: High-Grade Spirit Stone</h1><p>Chapter 826: High-Grade Spirit Stone</p><p>Master Yi sized up Qin Sang.</p><p>Having never sparred with him, he couldn't tell from appearances whether Qin Sang had undergone body refinement. He was secretly surprised that the other party not only had such high cultivation but also practiced both spiritual and physical cultivation. This talent was truly remarkable; he hadn't misjudged him.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't hide it from Master Yi, and nodded.  "I wasn't a body cultivator before, but my cultivation hit a bottleneck, and I couldn't see any hope of breaking through. I had no choice but to seek other methods. Trying body refinement was a last resort, hoping it could help me learn by analogy. Master Yi, you truly are a great Master Alchemist, your knowledge is profound; you immediately identified the effects of these spirit herbs."</p><p>"I just happened to see them mentioned in my research…"</p><p>Master Yi simply took out an ancient scroll and gave it to Qin Sang. "Qin Daoist, you can read it yourself.  These two spirit herbs are recorded in this ancient scroll.  The Scorpion Venom Grass contains a potent poison. Refining the body with intense poison – its medicinal properties are even more ferocious than the Dominating Blood Fruit. They are both extremely potent herbs. Without the power of a demonic beast bloodline to suppress them, at best you'll be crippled, and at worst, you'll die from the poisonous shock. Even human body cultivators shouldn't take them lightly. Daoist, please be careful."</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, took the scroll, and carefully examined it.</p><p>While he was reading, Master Yi said, "Actually, these two spirit herbs aren't entirely demonic fruits. The Qingwu Root has a milder medicinal effect. We humans have records of it too, called Maoshan Vine, used to make pills that strengthen bones and muscles, increasing strength. It's somewhat underwhelming. However, the Qingwu Root's effects are certainly not limited to that, but only demonic beasts can fully digest it.  We lose a lot of its medicinal properties during refinement."</p><p>Qin Sang memorized all the demonic fruits recorded in the ancient scroll, then returned it to Master Yi.</p><p>"Master Yi, have these three spirit herbs ever appeared in the Canglang Sea before?"</p><p>Master Yi thought for a moment, then said, "In my memory, two hundred years ago, there was indeed a Maoshan Vine, or Qingwu Root, auctioned at an auction house. It was said that the seller found it accidentally in the Demon Sea, but it didn't sell for a high price. As for who the buyer was, that's now untraceable. That's the only time. As for the Scorpion Venom Grass, I've never heard of it."</p><p>It seems gathering these spirit herbs is no easier than finding a place for Star Yuan body tempering.</p><p>Qin Sang looked thoughtful and asked Master Yi to keep an eye out.</p><p>They chatted for a while longer, then Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang visited several familiar shopkeepers he knew, and unexpectedly, he found something.</p><p>A shopkeeper told him that someone had a high-grade Fire Spirit Stone, but the exchange requirements were very strict: it had to be a spirit herb that could cleanse demonic煞 energy from the primordial spirit.</p><p>If the herb was good enough, they'd add some low-grade spirit stones.</p><p>High-grade spirit stones were rare, but for most Foundation Establishment cultivators, they weren't essential.  Only those who founded sects and had extremely strong protective formations would need high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>Few people, like Qin Sang, urgently needed high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>And this kind of spirit herb that could cleanse demonic煞 energy was extremely effective for most human Foundation Establishment experts who had broken through by taking the Demonic煞 Pill.</p><p>Over the years, such herbs became increasingly scarce, and prices soared.  That person only had one high-grade spirit stone and wanted to exchange it for a spirit herb, depending on the opportunity.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang remembered he did indeed have a Jinlan Grass.</p><p>He had obtained this Jinlan Grass when he killed Du Han in the Western Frontier of the Witch God Continent, and he hadn't had a chance to use it since. Although he had been short of funds for a while, he wouldn't use such a treasure to exchange for money.</p><p>The worth of this exchange was entirely up to his judgment.</p><p>Qin Sang urgently needed a high-grade spirit stone, and the Jinlan Grass itself wasn't that extravagantly valuable, so he immediately agreed to the exchange and asked the shopkeeper to contact that person.</p><p>While drinking tea in the shop and waiting for a while, the shopkeeper brought in a person.</p><p>Qin Sang was a little speechless when he saw him. This person, for a single herb, wore a black robe and a hooded cloak—both were treasures that could shield his aura. He was even more cautious than Qin Sang had been.</p><p>"Daoist, you have a Jinlan Grass, is it a mature herb?"</p><p>The black-robed man's voice was hoarse, clearly disguised.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't waste words, took out a jade box and handed it to the black-robed man.</p><p>After a careful examination, the black-robed man carefully took out a pouch and gave it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the high-grade spirit stone; a wave of heat immediately hit him. Sensing the pure Fire-elemental spiritual energy, his face lit up, and he looked at the black-robed man. "It's indeed a high-grade spirit stone. Do you have any other high-grade spirit stones, any element is fine, you can name your price."</p><p>"You really need high-grade spirit stones, unfortunately I only have this one. Since you have no objections to this transaction, I'll take my leave."</p><p>The black-robed man was concise and efficient, turning to leave immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly astonished, paid the shopkeeper his fee, and also took his leave.</p><p>By the time he walked out, the black-robed man had vanished without a trace.</p><p>He only has three high-grade spirit stones.  Completely refining the Xuan iron pillar needs at least four, and he needs to reserve two for the ancient teleportation array.  That means he needs to find three more. Thankfully, there are no attribute requirements, otherwise it would be even more troublesome.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered as he walked.</p><p>Shortly after he left.</p><p>In a secret room within the shop.</p><p>The black-robed man returned, toying with a Golden Fence Grass, appearing indifferent to the spiritual herb. The shopkeeper stood before him, awaiting instructions with a respectful expression.</p><p>"Willing to part with even this herb, this person truly needs high-grade spirit stones urgently.  I wonder just how much he needs..."</p><p>The black-robed man said calmly.</p><p>The shopkeeper nodded eagerly. "High-grade spirit stones are indeed hard to come by now. I hear there's been trouble in the Demon Sea lately.  The spirit mines recently discovered by both factions were taken by the demon clan. It's going to be even harder to find them in the future. This person has been searching for some time. He disappeared for several years, whether in seclusion or traveling elsewhere, and still hasn't found any. It seems he's not from any major faction, likely a lone cultivator, which fits Master's requirements."</p><p>"His cultivation is a bit low, but he'll suffice as support. We can hire him with just a few spirit stones, not bad."</p><p>The black-robed man nodded.  "The time isn't right yet. Let's keep him as a backup. Don't contact him. Continue to keep an eye out for others. We need to hire more late-stage experts to ensure success.  We can offer them generous terms. I'm here on Master's orders, and the senior brother will also arrive soon.  There's no need to worry about treasures; we'll be able to satisfy their demands."</p><p>"That..."</p><p>The shopkeeper's face fell. "Late-stage experts among lone cultivators are scarce. Most have been recruited by major factions. I'll do my best..."</p><p>While they were in their secret meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang left the market, winding through the streets until he arrived at the mundane courtyard he'd purchased earlier, where he found a sound transmission talisman sealed within a protective barrier.  Lady Liu had contacted him while he was away.</p>
