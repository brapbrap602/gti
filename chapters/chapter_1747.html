<h1>Chapter 1738: The True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix</h1><p>Facing the seal of the Phoenix Clan's ancestral hall, Qin Sang directly summoned six divine birds. A streak of crimson fire streaked across the sky, its dazzling light piercing through the mist, turning the sky above the spirit island into a sea of fire. The surrounding seawater was dyed red, resembling molten lava.</p><p>The sudden departure of the Phoenix King threw the Phoenix Clan into chaos. They were easily suppressed by Qin Sang's avatar, and just as they were scrambling to regain their footing, they sensed the aura erupting from the ancestral hall, causing them to shudder in fear.</p><p>As the divine birds soared through the air, Qin Sang swiftly retreated. The moment the fiery stream engulfed the Phoenix Clan's ancestral hall, the entire ancestral land of the Phoenix Clan, along with the jungle where they resided, trembled violently. Countless demonic birds were startled from the forest, their dark flocks flying aimlessly like headless flies. Seeing the towering flames from the direction of the forbidden area, they let out panicked cries.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in mid-air, watching the ancestral hall turn into a sea of fire. His eyes narrowed slightly, and a look of surprise flashed across his face. The power of the six divine birds had been tested multiple times, but to his astonishment, as the flames dimmed slightly, he could see that the Phoenix Clan's ancestral hall had not been destroyed. It stood firm amidst the raging inferno!</p><p>The ancestral hall creaked and groaned, on the verge of collapse. But the light barrier formed by the seal was still intact! Although the barrier was covered in visible cracks, it did not shatter immediately. Moreover, a strange power continuously seeped out from the ancestral hall. As this power merged with the barrier, the cracks gradually healed.</p><p>The Sun Divine Birds, which had always been unstoppable, had failed to break the seal! With Qin Sang's keen eyes, he could naturally see that this power originated from the broken feather. The force resisting the Sun Divine Birds was not the ancient hall's restriction itself but the result of the fusion between the hall's restriction and the power of the broken feather.</p><p>In the legends of the Phoenix Clan of the Demon Sea, the broken feather was said to be a true feather of the ancient Heavenly Phoenix, a treasure of the clan. Back then, when the various races of the Demon Sea sent people to infiltrate the Canglang Sea and enter the Seven Slaughter Hall to steal the dragon corpse, it was mainly led by the Phoenix Clan and the Dragon Clan. The previous Dragon King had risked his life and offered great benefits to persuade the Phoenix Clan to bring out the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix, which was then entrusted to the Nine Phoenix King, whose bloodline was most compatible with the feather.</p><p>The broken feather, being a true feather of the ancient Heavenly Phoenix, naturally possessed immense power. The Phoenix Clan's ancestral hall was the place where the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix was enshrined, and it relied on this feather to maintain its impregnable seal.</p><p>The Phoenix Clan of the Demon Sea claimed to be descendants of the Heavenly Phoenix, but most of their members could not gain the recognition of the true feather. Once separated from the ancestral hall, only those descendants whose bloodline was most compatible with the true feather could barely wield a portion of its power, and even then, with great limitations, making it unsuitable for use on the battlefield. Otherwise, the Phoenix Clan could simply summon the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix to exhaust the human race.</p><p>The decline of the Canglang Sea's Witch Clan and the rise of the human race had only occurred over the past few thousand years. In terms of heritage, neither could compare to the Demon Sea's demonic races, which was why the Demon Sea's demonic races dared to brazenly invade the Canglang Sea. Even if they were defeated, they could simply retreat to their ancestral lands and hold their ground, leaving the human and witch races powerless against them.</p><p>Allowing the Nine Phoenix King to take the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix to a foreign land inevitably raised concerns about losing the clan's treasure. In fact, the Dragon King had indeed perished in the Seven Slaughter Hall. If not for the top experts of the human and witch races risking their lives to seal the Demon Lord, the Nine Phoenix King and other demons outside Yitian Peak would not have survived.</p><p>However, the Phoenix King had other considerations. At that time, the Demon Sea's demonic races had already begun to suspect that the distance between the Demon Sea and the Canglang Sea was not as vast as imagined. The Demon Sea had also produced Divine Transformation experts who knew about the existence of a barrier around the Demon Sea, allowing them to leave but not return. The connection between the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea was established after the discovery of the Seven Slaughter Hall.</p><p>The Demon Sea's demonic races speculated that the Seven Slaughter Hall was the key and that it might not be accessible only from the Canglang Sea. Besides searching for the dragon corpse, the Dragon King's group had another mission: to use the Heavenly Phoenix's feather to explore the secrets of the Seven Slaughter Hall and find an exit towards the Demon Sea.</p><p>The Dragon King was caught in the battle with the Demon Lord and perished. Later, the Nine Phoenix King dared not pursue the dragon corpse any further and instead went into hiding, secretly exploring the Seven Slaughter Hall. Before she could find anything, the Seven Slaughter Hall ascended, and the two realms were connected, which could be considered a mission accomplished.</p><p>Although Qin Sang did not know all the details, he had personally witnessed the Nine Phoenix King using this feather to break through the inner hall's immortal restrictions. He had tried to estimate the power of the broken feather as highly as possible, but it seemed he had still underestimated it.</p><p>The stronger the seal, the higher the grade of the broken feather! As Qin Sang watched the cracks on the seal visibly heal, the power of the South Ming Li Fire was blocked by the seal, unable to burn the ancient hall.</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated his profound technique, and a vast amount of true essence poured into the Sun Divine Tree. Six newly formed divine birds took flight and plunged into the sea of fire!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>Layers of fire waves surged, turning the spirit island into a fiery domain. Amidst the raging flames, faint cracking sounds could be heard. Qin Sang's expression shifted, and his figure suddenly vanished.</p><p>At the same time, a crack appeared in the dark sky, revealing flickering sword stars within. The Phoenix King appeared before the crack and rushed out. She immediately saw the ruins at the center of the sea of fire and Qin Sang standing amidst the wreckage of the ancient hall. Her eyes widened in fury, and she let out a mournful roar.</p><p>Qin Sang was examining an object in his right hand. It was a feather over a foot long, with signs of breakage. The feather shimmered with the same spiritual light as the seal's barrier, but the light was gradually fading until it completely lost its color, turning a withered yellow. However, the intricate patterns on the feather could still be seen.</p><p>Even though the spiritual light had dimmed, Qin Sang dared not touch it directly and instead enveloped it with his true essence. Fortunately, the feather's power was not as violent as the Vermilion Bird's true feather, so there was no need to suppress it with other treasures.</p><p>He looked up and saw the Phoenix King breaking through the formation, surprising him. Although he had not focused his attention on the Phoenix King earlier, she was only at the late Transformation stage. According to common sense, she should not have been able to break through the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation so quickly.</p><p>Sensing the spiritual energy emanating from the Phoenix King, Qin Sang understood. Near the ancestral hall, the Phoenix King could connect with the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix through the seal, gaining powers beyond her own realm. Now that the ancestral hall was destroyed and the true feather was in Qin Sang's hands, the Phoenix King's aura rapidly declined.</p><p>"The Demon Sea's demonic races indeed possess a great heritage!" Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>If he had not been cautious and swiftly destroyed the ancestral hall with overwhelming force, allowing the Phoenix King to summon the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix, capturing her would have been no easy task.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Qin Sang secretly formed a sword seal. The dark starry sky behind the Phoenix King suddenly dissipated, and in the next moment, seven sword avatars surrounded her. Seven bright sword lights crisscrossed above the Phoenix King's head, ready to strike at Qin Sang's command!</p><p>"I have no intention of causing more bloodshed. I hope you will think twice," Qin Sang said deeply, his tone meaningful.</p><p>The Phoenix King's body stiffened. She could sense the sharp and powerful sword intent locked onto her. Without the protection of the ancestral hall, with her current abilities, not only would she be unable to harm Qin Sang or retrieve the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix, but escaping would also be difficult.</p><p>This was the ancestral land of the Phoenix Clan. With the ancestral hall destroyed, there was no way to counter Qin Sang. If he decided to unleash a massacre, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>She glared at Qin Sang, her right sleeve trembling slightly as if hiding some means of attack. She hesitated several times, but upon seeing the Sun Divine Tree floating beside Qin Sang, a look of fear flashed in her eyes, and reason ultimately prevailed.</p><p>The Phoenix King clenched her fists, almost grinding her teeth, and forced out a sentence, "I have never seen you before!"</p><p>A Divine Transformation cultivator couldn't have just popped out of nowhere.</p><p>"I am not from the Canglang Sea, so of course you wouldn't recognize me," Qin Sang replied casually, his attention still drawn to the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix.</p><p>The Phoenix King's pupils contracted. The invisible barrier had indeed been protecting them, and it was no mere rumor. The barrier had only disappeared a few hundred years ago, and already a Divine Transformation expert from a foreign land had arrived. Could the human race of the foreign lands be so powerful?</p><p>"Since you come from a foreign land, you should have no grievances with the races of the Demon Sea. Do you intend to meddle in the conflict between our two realms and help the human race slaughter the demonic races? Aren't you afraid of being labeled as a bully for picking on the weak?"</p><p>This line of questioning seemed feeble, and the Phoenix King knew she was bluffing, her heart growing cold.</p><p>"Who said we have no grievances?" Qin Sang smiled faintly and raised the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix. "Although I am from a foreign land, this is not my first time here. Back when my cultivation was still shallow, your subordinate, the Nine Phoenix King, pursued me in the Seven Slaughter Hall with this feather. I killed her and took the feather to settle that old score, but I have no intention of causing further trouble."</p><p>The Phoenix King was both shocked and doubtful. When the Nine Phoenix King had returned, she had reported her experiences in the Seven Slaughter Hall, mentioning that she had pursued a cultivator and nearly been caught in Yitian Peak. But that person had only been at the Golden Core stage back then!</p><p>With the Nine Phoenix King dead, there was no way to verify the truth, and it didn't matter anymore. Since the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix was now in Qin Sang's hands, he would not willingly return it. The fact that he hadn't unleashed a massacre in the Phoenix Clan's ancestral land was already a stroke of luck amidst misfortune.</p><p>But the Phoenix King dared not fully believe Qin Sang's words. She took a deep breath, calming the fury in her chest, and forced herself to remain composed. "So, you won't help the human race slaughter my clan or interfere in the conflict between our two realms?"</p><p>"Not exactly," Qin Sang shook his head. "One of my purposes for coming here is related to this, but it's not what you think. As long as you are sensible, I will not create more bloodshed. However, you alone may not be able to make the decision. I need you to guide me to visit the Dragon King."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Qin Sang looked towards the outskirts of the spirit island. "Quickly tell your clansmen to stop, or my avatar will no longer hold back."</p><p>With the Phoenix King trapped by Qin Sang's true self, his avatar and demonic soul were wreaking havoc outside. Having been driven into their ancestral land, the Phoenix Clan's demon kings had no way out and were fighting with their lives on the line, displaying ferocious bravery.</p><p>The Phoenix King's expression shifted between gloom and uncertainty. She let out a long sigh and emitted a clear cry, and the chaos outside abruptly ceased.</p><p>...</p><p>In the western part of the Phoenix Clan's ancestral land, a magical boat cut through the waves on the calm sea. The avatar stood at the bow, personally steering the boat, while the Phoenix King stood beside him, her face cold as ice.</p><p>As they traveled, Qin Sang could sense the presence of demonic creatures watching them from nearby. The further they went into the Demon Sea, the more numerous these creatures became, with dragon-like beings appearing more frequently towards the rear.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned that the top three clans of the Demon Sea's demonic races were the Dragon Clan, the Phoenix Clan, and the Golden Toad Clan. Convincing these three clans would secure the overall situation.</p><p>He openly headed towards the Dragon Clan, unafraid of any potential traps ahead.</p><p>The sea stretched endlessly before them.</p><p>After traveling an unknown distance, the waters ahead suddenly churned, and the sea split open from the front of the boat, rising high like a mountain. A dark shadow emerged from the depths.</p><p>Two groups appeared, one of golden dragons and the other of black dragons, led by two humanoid demon kings with horns.</p><p>Qin Sang's true self appeared at the bow of the boat, recognizing these as the Dragon King's personal guards, but the Dragon King himself was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The two groups of dragon guards surfaced and stopped ahead. The two demon kings bowed to Qin Sang from a distance and then struck out with their hands. Two streams of water converged between them, forming a water mirror that displayed a majestic man wearing a golden crown and dragon robes—the Dragon King himself.</p><p>The two sides faced each other through the water mirror. The Dragon King glanced at the expressionless Phoenix King and clasped his hands in greeting.</p><p>"According to human etiquette, should I address you as 'True Person' or 'True Lord'? I have failed to welcome you properly, my apologies!"</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly and replied without mincing words, "Titles are but empty names. You may address me as you wish, Dragon King. My intentions should already be clear to you. What is your decision?"</p><p>"For you to demand our retreat with a single word, how can I be sure this isn't a delaying tactic?" the Dragon King asked.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "If I intended harm to the Demon Sea, why would I need a delaying tactic? If I suddenly attacked on the battlefield, how many of you could escape? Or should I destroy the ancestral halls of each of your clans one by one before you agree to my mediation?"</p><p>At the last sentence, Qin Sang's tone turned icy.</p><p>The dragon guards' eyes burned with anger, but they dared not speak.</p><p>The Dragon King remained silent for a long time. "The message you sent earlier seemed to have more to it."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the dragon clansmen on either side of the water mirror. "This matter is of great importance and not suitable for public discussion. Can your water mirror technique transmit secret messages?"</p><p>"He is my younger brother, and his lips are sealed. If you transmit your message to him, he will relay it to me through a secret technique," the Dragon King pointed to the demon king on the right side of the water mirror.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and whispered.</p><p>Soon, the demon king's expression changed to one of shock. He did not dare delay and quickly relayed the message to the Dragon King in the ancestral land through a secret technique.</p><p>In the water mirror, the Dragon King suddenly stood up.</p><p>He wanted to ask if it was true, but reason told him that this True Lord would not have traveled thousands of miles just to deceive them.</p><p>"I can swear a karmic oath," Qin Sang paused and then added, "This is a calamity that no cultivator in this realm can escape. I hope to gain your full cooperation. Once it is resolved, you may fight as you wish, and I will not interfere."</p><p>The Dragon King paced back and forth a few steps, glanced at the Phoenix King, and said, "I need to consult with the other clan leaders before making a decision."</p><p>"I will wait here," Qin Sang returned to the magical boat.</p><p>The water mirror dissipated, and the dragon guards silently stood guard. Without Qin Sang's orders, the Phoenix King dared not leave the boat.</p><p>The sea returned to calm.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>Inside the boat, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix resting on his knees, and the Sun Divine Tree placed before him.</p><p>During the journey, he had discovered that the power contained within the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix was indeed a type of demonic fire, which he tentatively named the Phoenix True Fire!</p><p>Qin Sang activated the "Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus" technique and aimed it at the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix, attempting to extract a wisp of demonic fire using a secret method and compare it with the South Ming Li Fire within the Sun Divine Tree.</p><p>"Failed!"</p><p>The firelight dimmed, and a sigh was heard.</p><p>But Qin Sang's face showed no sign of disappointment. He could feel that when he activated the secret method, there seemed to be a fluctuation within the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix. At the very least, it should be easier to refine than the South Ming Li Fire.</p><p>As he pondered, a voice suddenly rang in Qin Sang's ears, clear and crisp like that of a seven or eight-year-old girl, but the words were not pleasant.</p><p>"You're going to die."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, and his gaze sharpened like a sword as he turned towards the Sun Divine Tree!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
