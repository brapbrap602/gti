<h1>Chapter 1724: A Promise Kept</h1><p>The river wound its way through the land, passing by villages nestled on its banks.  This area was surprisingly populous compared to other parts of Nan Zhou.  Taoism and Buddhism were deeply ingrained in the lives of the people, and despite its remote location, a Buddhist temple called Lianxi Temple stood nearby, home to nuns.  The name "Lianxi" was a reference to the Lianxi River.</p><p>Lianxi Temple was an ordinary earthly temple; the nuns were ordinary people. There were no known supernatural occurrences within its walls.  Local villagers offered incense and prayers simply for peace of mind.</p><p>Qin Sang landed by the river, standing still, and focused inward. The poison pearl slowly rotated within her dantian. Seven-colored light flowed around it, yet it seemed somewhat dim.  Inside the poison pearl was a black orb.  Upon closer inspection, one could see it wasn't solid, but formed from smoke – the venomous essence, the sacred object of Wan Du Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had promised the Poison King the essence of the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit in exchange for the poisonous smoke.  The idea of merging the Gu King and the sacred venomous essence to recreate the original Bloodthirsty miasma spirit was merely a hypothesis of Wan Du Mountain's founder, never proven.</p><p>Qin Sang lacked mastery of Wan Du Mountain's true teachings and couldn't control the sacred object, but with the help of the poison pearl, she had succeeded. Within less than half a year of studying at Wan Du Mountain, she made headway, successfully merging the first strand of the original poison and fulfilling her promise to the Poison King.</p><p>Creating the original poison was no easy task; even with Qin Sang’s cultivation, it couldn't be accomplished overnight. She allowed the Poison King to extract the sacred venomous essence, sealed it within the poison pearl, and brought it out to slowly refine it.</p><p>This time, she overdrew from the sacred object's power. Her old injuries hadn't healed, and the damage was even worse than before.  After returning it to the restricted area, she lay motionless like a corpse, it was unknown how long it would take for her to recover.</p><p>The Poison King, having obtained the essence of the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit, could use it to verify his cultivation methods and attempt to reach the Transcendence Stage. Moreover, his insights would benefit future generations of Wan Du Mountain.  In the past, even a thousand-year slumber of the sacred object would have been acceptable.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew her spiritual sense, looked up at the small temple atop the mountain, and walked up the mountain path.  She only encountered two pilgrims on her way, indicating that Lianxi Temple wasn't very popular.</p><p>Lianxi Temple was actually a secular branch of Yan Yue Temple, a hidden temple. Visiting Yan Yue Temple required prior notification from Lianxi Temple's abbess.  Because of its ties to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, Yan Yue Temple had to remain hidden from the world.</p><p>Qin Sang learned about the relationship between Lianxi Temple and Yan Yue Temple from Liuli.</p><p>Lianxi Temple's abbess seemed to know something. Upon seeing Qin Sang, before she could state her identity or purpose, the abbess respectfully bowed, offered her a seat, and then went to the back hall.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use her spiritual sense; she sat patiently for an incense stick’s time. When she sensed a familiar aura approaching, she stood up and saw an elderly nun entering.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this elderly nun was the current Yan Yue Temple abbess, Yun Xin Shi Tai.</p><p>"Greetings, Nun Yun Xin."  Qin Sang stepped forward, bowing deeply. "I am greatly indebted to you for saving me from danger years ago.  I regret that I was unable to thank you personally. Please forgive my tardiness."</p><p>Yun Xin Shi Tai quickly returned the courtesy. "Master Qin is too kind.  I didn't do much. It was my junior sister who rescued you regardless of the danger, and it was also she who held back the demon king.  Master Qin's gifts of invaluable scriptures have greatly benefited us. I always felt undeserving. Furthermore, hearing that Master Qin cleared the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's name at the Grand Ceremony, allowing future generations to see the light of day—I should be the one thanking you…"</p><p>It was a very polite and flattering exchange. The relationship between the two immediately became considerably closer.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind Yun Xin Shi Tai; no one else accompanied her.  Yun Xin Shi Tai, acutely aware of Qin Sang's gaze, promptly invited her to Yan Yue Temple as a guest, adding, "My junior sister, Liuli, is currently in seclusion, but I've sent word. She should be emerging from her retreat now.”</p><p>Yan Yue Temple was located deep within a remote and uninhabited mountain range.</p><p>Qin Sang flew with Yun Xin Shi Tai for a while. She sensed a subtle change in the air, her eyes flashed, but she didn't comment. Then, she saw the mountain scenery shift, trees swaying, revealing a few serene temple buildings.</p><p>After they settled in a stone pavilion in the temple, Qin Sang and Yun Xin Shi Tai discussed the Ascension Platform.</p><p>More than half a year had passed since the Grand Ceremony. The news Qin Sang revealed at the ceremony had already spread throughout the cultivation world. From Bei Huang to Nan Hai, from Dong Hai to Xi Mo, the entire Zhong Zhou was shaken.</p><p>Large and small sects, as well as independent cultivators, were all searching for the Ascension Platform. The top clans with powerful cultivators leading them were the most diligent, searching even their own forbidden areas countless times.</p><p>Alternatively, one could look for the Ascension Platform by searching for ancient demons.  Ancient demons like Gui Mu, whose cultivation was sealed, unaffected by the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound, might still be lingering somewhere.</p><p>Gu Mo undoubtedly knows the location of the Ascension Platform.</p><p>It's necessary to first find a sealed demonic realm, similar to the ruins of ancient cultivators.  Avoid rash actions; ordinary people shouldn't get involved, lest they unleash demonic beings.</p><p>Master Xingji and others are stationed in the Central Plains, gathering information from all directions.  They have also contacted the Dragon Whale Sage of the East Sea's demon clan, exchanging secrets.</p><p>It's a truly unprecedented sight in history, that the human and demon races, different sects and schools of thought, regardless of their traditions, are cooperating on a single task.</p><p>From the land to the deep sea, the footprints of the realm's cultivators are everywhere.</p><p>While the Ascension Platform hasn't been found, several unknown secret realms have been discovered unexpectedly. Those with great fortune have gained immense opportunities.</p><p>However, very few descendants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect have dared to reveal themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang wants to ask Abbess Yunxin to contact these people.  Yanyue Temple should be in contact with some of them.</p><p>Abbess Yunxin readily agreed.</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  Abbess Yunxin also sensed it, stood up, and smiled gently, “I recall something I must attend to.  Please excuse me for a moment, True Monarch…”</p><p>“Please, go ahead.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly.</p><p>As soon as Abbess Yunxin left, a female lay nun appeared at the end of the stone steps outside the pavilion, walking from the mist.  She wore a simple grey robe, her nun's hat covering her dark hair, but not her stunning beauty.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, gazing at the woman quietly until she reached the pavilion.</p><p>Young nuns peeked from behind distant trees, giggling at the scene before being hushed and pulled away by their companion, adding a touch of liveliness to the picturesque countryside.</p><p>“Congratulations on achieving the Transcendence stage, Daoist friend,”  Liuli looked at Qin Sang intently, her usual calm voice showing a rare ripple of emotion, seemingly filled with wonder.</p><p>Their first meeting was something they wouldn't easily speak of.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had just reached the Foundation Establishment stage, using a foundation-building elixir bought with the sale of himself, while Liuli was just a step away from becoming a Nascent Soul cultivator.  The difference between them was vast.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang was forced to leave, and when they met again, his cultivation had surpassed hers.</p><p>Now, the gap is even wider.</p><p>Liuli could hardly imagine how someone with five spiritual roots could achieve this, what incredible willpower it took to reach this point.</p><p>“Congratulations on reaching the late Nascent Soul stage, Fairy.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly returned the courtesy.</p><p>He had been thinking about how to tell Liuli about the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound.</p><p>Liuli's experience was the opposite of his; she may have suffered no less than he had.</p><p>Before reaching the Nascent Soul stage, he struggled; Liuli progressed smoothly.</p><p>After achieving Nascent Soul, with the effects of his cultivation technique and jade Buddha, his cultivation path became relatively smooth, but Liuli was plagued by the imprint of an evil technique, facing many hardships.</p><p>Liuli, with her unwavering resolve, relentlessly fought the imprint, and eventually, she found a solution through Buddhist teachings, only to face a new obstacle: the demonic sound, as the immortal dao of this realm was nearly extinguished.</p><p>The world can be cruel indeed!</p><p>They sat opposite each other in the pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, creating a barrier around the pavilion to prevent observation.</p><p>To those inside, everything appeared normal; those outside could only see a black curtain.</p><p>Liuli looked up at him questioningly.</p><p>“Fairy, have you forgotten your vow to save your master?”</p><p>Qin Sang began with a rhetorical question.</p><p>From his understanding of Liuli, saving her master was her lifelong obsession; she had even practiced a yin-yang cultivation technique to achieve this.  She wouldn't forget.</p><p>As expected, Liuli frowned, but seeing Qin Sang staring at her seriously, waiting for an answer, she replied quietly, “No.”</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “I have broken through to the Transcendence stage.  According to custom, I will cultivate for a period before going to the East.  After ascension, I will do my best to help the fairy investigate the whereabouts of your master and, if possible, rescue her.”</p><p>Concerning the safety of her master, Liuli couldn't refuse, she opened her lips to thank him, but Qin Sang interrupted.</p><p>“However, I would prefer to see the fairy rescue your master herself.  Only then would it not be in vain, and we outsiders could never match your dedication.”</p><p>Qin Sang's words were somewhat peculiar; he seemed to be encouraging her.</p><p>Liuli didn't need encouragement, but she understood Qin Sang's good intentions, saying, “I won't be lax.”</p><p>“I believe in your strong will and your talent for reaching the Transcendence stage; however, the world is unpredictable…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, no longer hesitating, recounting the changes in the Heavenly Dao to Liuli in detail.</p><p>He held nothing back, explaining the threat of the demonic sound and his speculations about the changes in the heavens.</p><p>The stone pavilion was silent.</p><p>Qin Sang watched her quietly without speaking.</p><p>Liuli kept her head down, staring at the stone table between them; her expression was unreadable.  After a long while, she finally raised her head, her expression and tone as cold as ever, “Because of the changes in the Heavens, you're looking for the Ascension Platform.”</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Liuli's unwavering resolve was extraordinary.  Despite the devastating blow, her spirit remained unbroken.</p><p>"That's true," Qin Sang nodded. "But we must consider what we'll do if this is the only Ascension Platform."</p><p>Liuli's lips moved slightly.</p><p>She knew her own condition best.  She had successfully used Buddhist practices to suppress the demonic imprint, otherwise her breakthrough to late Yuan Ying stage wouldn't have been so smooth.  But the imprint remained, a hidden danger. Others might have a chance, but with the Heavenly Demon's Song, the Heart Demon Tribulation, and the imprint all attacking at once, she had no hope of survival.</p><p>"Do you remember what Elder Gui Mu said?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly asked an unrelated question.</p><p>To solve Liuli's problem, Elder Gui Mu had said four words—'Unblocking is better than blocking'.</p><p>The explanation to Liuli back then wasn't so direct, but it implied the same meaning.</p><p>Liuli's eyes flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke, as if in contemplation, "Cultivators always talk about transcendence, regarding the seven emotions and six desires as obstacles to cultivation, some even fearing them like tigers. But in my view, true cultivation is to be free from both emotional attachments and detachment.  What do you think, Lady Liuli?"</p><p>Liuli looked intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't flinch, meeting her gaze.  The Qianjun Ring gleamed, and two things flew out— coincidentally, both half-formed spirit embryos.</p><p>One was a Tian Linglong spirit embryo.</p><p>The other was a superior Zhenling incense medicine embryo.</p><p>"If we can't find the Ascension Platform, Gui Xu is inevitable. The Qinghu Saint King is my enemy, and the Huiguang Saint also plotted against me. I'm alone and need help... Lady Liuli, you're the only person I completely trust in this world. Helping you is helping myself."</p><p>Qin Sang placed the two treasures on the stone table.</p><p>Under the Heavenly Demon's Song, ordinary people have almost no chance of surviving the Heart Demon Tribulation, let alone Liuli. To help her ascend to the Transformation stage, these two treasures were clearly insufficient.</p><p>They needed to deal with the demonic imprint.</p><p>Qin Sang had been pondering this for some time, but any attempt would require Liuli's willing cooperation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't pressure her to accept immediately.</p><p>After putting down the treasures, Qin Sang said, "Lady Liuli, please don't refuse hastily. I intend to unite the cultivators of this world. I'll be traveling west and exploring various regions soon, and then investigating the edges of Gui Xu.  A sixty-year period might not be enough.  I'll leave these two treasures at the Yan Yue Temple for now.  Please consider this carefully and make a decision later."</p><p>Refining the Tian Linglong was possible, but gathering the herbs needed for the superior Zhenling incense would be difficult for even Liuli alone.</p><p>Qin Sang would also look for them during his travels.</p><p>Leaving the two treasures was a demonstration of his resolve to Liuli.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, as long as Liuli accepts him, they could work together to overcome any obstacle!</p><p>Even if the demonic imprint couldn't be removed, and Liuli truly became a Xuan Nu, as long as she could ascend to Transformation, it would be worth it.</p><p>The vast world is full of mysteries; they could seek a solution later.</p><p>Of course, everyone has their own convictions. Qin Sang wouldn't force his ideas on Liuli; he could only let her understand on her own.</p><p>Having said that, Qin Sang pressed the stone table, stood up tall, and left without hesitation. As he reached the pavilion's edge, he paused.</p><p>"Lady Liuli, you should know my character. If you can let go of your worries, regardless of whether we can remove the imprint, I have only one thing to say…"</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his back to Liuli, gazing at the vast land beyond the mountains.</p><p>It was early morning, the eastern sky ablaze with golden light, the sun about to rise.</p><p>"No matter what, I will never let you down!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bid farewell to Abbess Yun Xin, striding down the mountain. His robes fluttered as the rising sun cast his silhouette against the distant mountains, its golden light reflected in Liuli's eyes.</p><p>Eight words, resounding in the pavilion.</p><p>In the pavilion...</p><p>Two treasures, enough to drive the whole world mad, lay before Liuli, but she didn't glance at them.  She stared at Qin Sang's back until he disappeared among the mountain mists.</p><p>A gentle breeze stirred the trees outside the pavilion, everything silent.</p><p>…</p><p>Since Qin Sang's arrival, all the nuns in Yan Yue Temple had been watching the stone pavilion.</p><p>Seeing him leave so quickly and without saying goodbye, they were all surprised, including Abbess Yun Xin.</p><p>Liuli had risked her life to save Qin Zhenjun; and Qin Zhenjun clearly cared for her deeply.</p><p>What's more, they were both exceptionally talented and well-suited, it was hoped they wouldn't repeat the tragedy of their ancestors.</p><p>They had expected to witness a happy marriage.</p><p>"What happened? Go and see my junior sister…"</p><p>A nun, anxious, was about to rush to the pavilion, but Abbess Yun Xin stopped her, sending everyone back to the temple.</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving Yan Yue Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang chose a mountaintop, sat facing the rising sun, inhaled the purple qi, meditated for a long time, then stood up and continued his journey.</p><p>(End)</p>
