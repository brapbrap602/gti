<h1>Chapter 1142: An Old Acquaintance Among Demons</h1><p>The other party had been lurking in the Demon King's cave all this time, only making a move now. Could it be that, like me, they had followed the guards and sneaked in together?  </p><p>That thought sent a chill down Qin Sang's spine.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had not detected anything at all.  </p><p>Qin Sang believed it was highly unlikely that the other party was a Nascent Soul cultivator or a fully transformed demon. Otherwise, he would have already been exposed under their watchful gaze.  </p><p>Steadying his mind, Qin Sang refrained from acting rashly. He slowed his pace and quietly trailed behind.  </p><p>The Demon King's favored concubine's chamber was brightly lit.  </p><p>A green wolf, leading a group of lesser demons, stood guard at the foot of the mountain, all of them looking dejected.  </p><p>While the grand feast was in full swing ahead, they were the only ones being scolded.  </p><p>The Demon King's favored concubine had vented all her anger on them. It was only after she had exhausted herself and returned to her chamber that they finally got a moment of peace.  </p><p>"Keep your eyes sharp! If anything goes wrong, I won't wait for the Demon King's ordersâ€”I'll seal your cultivation and throw you all into the Ten Thousand Serpents Cave!"  </p><p>The green wolf growled, its eyes flashing with ferocity as it bared its teeth.  </p><p>"Who's there?"  </p><p>In the next moment, a gray falcon demon emerged from the shadows, flying straight toward the green wolf and its group. Its movements were extremely cautious, as if afraid of alerting the Demon King's favored concubine.  </p><p>Seeing the gray falcon, the green wolf felt a sense of familiarity and recalled that it was a lesser demon under the White-Feathered Eagle's command.  </p><p>"Is that you?"  </p><p>The lesser demons were about to swarm forward, but the green wolf barked at them to back off.  </p><p>"Did the White-Feathered Eagle send you?"  </p><p>The gray falcon, unable to speak human language, nodded repeatedly. It flew up to the green wolf and carefully placed a pouch it was carrying on the ground. A crisp clinking sound accompanied the faint, intoxicating aroma of fine wine.  </p><p>Then, the gray falcon respectfully stepped aside and pointed upward with its wing.  </p><p>"Did the Demon King order you to bring us this immortal wine?"  </p><p>The green wolf's eyes lit up. It tore open the pouch and saw bottles of exquisite wine inside. The frustration in its chest vanished instantly. It grabbed a few bottles and tossed the pouch to the demons behind it.  </p><p>"Brothers, the Demon King hasn't forgotten us! Take these and share them!"  </p><p>The lesser demons, who had been salivating over the wine, cheered and scrambled to grab the bottles.  </p><p>"Fine wine indeed!"  </p><p>The green wolf downed a bottle in one gulp, smacking its lips in satisfaction. "I heard this immortal wine was bought by the Demon King from the Yuan Demon King. It truly lives up to its reputation!"  </p><p>After downing three bottles in quick succession, the green wolf glanced at the gray falcon and sneered, "I think your Demon King should be called the White-Feathered Mouse instead. As timid as a mouse! The Demon King ordered him to deliver wine to me, yet he didn't dare come himself."  </p><p>The gray falcon replied, "Wolf King, please calm your anger. The Eagle King is stationed at the front mountain and cannot leave his post."  </p><p>"Tch..."  </p><p>The green wolf scoffed, but its expression suddenly froze.  </p><p>The lesser demons were also stunned.  </p><p>This gray falcon had never been enlightened by the Demon King, yet it was speaking human language.  </p><p>"Fall! Fall! Fall!"  </p><p>The gray falcon raised its wing and gently patted the air downward.  </p><p>The lesser demons' eyes rolled back, and they collapsed to the ground, unconscious.  </p><p>The green wolf, being a Core Formation demon, was not so easily subdued. But when it tried to pounce on the gray falcon, it found its body weak and its demonic power stagnant, unable to muster any strength.  </p><p>"You..."  </p><p>The green wolf collapsed heavily to the ground, still struggling to resist. But then, a flash of light filled its vision as a net of crackling lightning descended upon it. A sharp pain shot through its body, and it fell unconscious.  </p><p>"This Immortal's Drunk is something I went through great trouble to acquire from the Immortal-Demon City. Even a late Core Formation demon can be knocked out by it. Too bad it only works when ingested."  </p><p>The gray falcon's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as it quickly dragged the green wolf and the other demons into the shadows.  </p><p>Then, it spat out a round pearl from its mouth.  </p><p>Once the pearl left its body, the gray falcon's aura surged dramatically.  </p><p>Its feathers, once gray, now shimmered with a silvery-white hue, as if lightning constantly danced across its wings.  </p><p>It looked like a thunder beast born from the tempest!  </p><p>Its eyes were sharp, and its talons resembled swords.  </p><p>Though it still resembled a falcon in appearance, its presence now far surpassed its previous form, like the difference between the full moon and a firefly.  </p><p>Even more astonishing was that the gray falcon, which had been a mere Spirit Awakening demon, had now leapt to the mid Core Formation stage!  </p><p>"This Mirage Pearl my mother left me is quite useful for disguises, but I had to seal my cultivation to make it flawless. Being ordered around by you all these years has been unbearable!"  </p><p>It kicked the green wolf fiercely, then looked up at the Demon King's favored concubine's chamber. The pearl flashed, and a mist surged around it. After swallowing the pearl again, it transformed into the green wolf and silently made its way up.  </p><p>In a nearby grove, Qin Sang hid in the shadows, having witnessed everything.  </p><p>Seeing the transformed falcon demon, Qin Sang suddenly felt a sense of familiarity.  </p><p>"Could it be?"  </p><p>Qin Sang stared at the falcon demon's silvery-white feathers.  </p><p>He suddenly recalled an event many years ago when he and Yun Youzi had infiltrated the Endless Valley in search of the Midnight Lily. They had witnessed a Thunder-Swallowing Falcon battling two human Nascent Soul cultivators.  </p><p>This falcon demon, though far weaker in aura and cultivation compared to the fully transformed Thunder-Swallowing Falcon, bore a striking resemblance to it.  </p><p>Qin Sang remembered that the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon had a fledgling, which he had once teased.  </p><p>Could this be that same fledgling?  </p><p>Confirming that it was only a mid Core Formation falcon demon relying on a strange treasure for disguise, and that it had long been hiding among the demons, Qin Sang felt relieved. It wasn't as terrifying as he had imagined. He quickly followed.  </p><p>The Demon King's favored concubine's chamber was adorned with light silk curtains and a white jade dressing table.  </p><p>At first glance, it looked like the boudoir of a human noblewoman.  </p><p>In fact, the chamber's owner, the Demon King's favored concubine, was indeed a female cultivator.  </p><p>This woman possessed stunning beauty, but her talent was somewhat lacking, leaving her stuck at the False Core stage. However, she was deeply cherished by the Demon King, who had promised to spare no effort in helping her break through to the Core Formation stage.  </p><p>Neither her cultivation nor her background could threaten the position of the Demon King's primary consort.  </p><p>The favored concubine was well aware of this, so she merely put on a show of venting her anger on the lesser demons, not daring to cause a scene at the birthday feast. At this moment, her face showed no trace of anger as she sat before the mirror, applying her makeup, radiant and alluring.  </p><p>"Madam, the Demon King has sent someone to deliver the immortal fruits and wine you love."  </p><p>The voice of the green wolf came from outside.  </p><p>"Hypocrisy! Why didn't he come himself?"  </p><p>The favored concubine snorted. With a sweep of her divine sense, she saw that it was indeed the green wolf delivering the items. She opened the barrier at the chamber's entrance. "Leave them outside!"  </p><p>"Yes!"  </p><p>...  </p><p>Suddenly, the favored concubine sensed something amiss. Through the mirror, she was horrified to see that the green wolf had somehow entered her chamber and was now standing behind her.  </p><p>"How dare you!"  </p><p>The favored concubine was both shocked and furious, but a cold sensation gripped her neck as a silver chain tightened around it.  </p><p>"Madam, don't act rashly. I know the Demon King has given you many protective treasures. If I get nervous and accidentally end your life, it would be unfortunate."  </p><p>The mist around the falcon demon dissipated, revealing its true form.  </p><p>"What do you want? I was forcibly taken by him! I know nothing!"  </p><p>Seeing an unfamiliar falcon demon, the favored concubine was terrified, not daring to move.  </p><p>"I'm not here to ask you anything."  </p><p>The falcon demon said indifferently, then flicked a bolt of lightning from its fingertip.  </p><p>The favored concubine's vision went dark as she fell unconscious.</p>
