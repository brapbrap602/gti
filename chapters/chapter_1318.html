<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1310: The Shadow in the Darkness</p><p>---</p><p>"Baseless speculation and demonic lies!"  </p><p>Elder Canghong snorted coldly.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi's eyes suddenly gleamed as he transmitted a message to Qin Sang while replying aloud, "Elder, there's no need for anger. Since Fellow Daoist Tianzheng will recover in due time, his appearance on the battlefield will reveal the truth, won't it? We can afford to wait a little longer. If Fellow Daoist Tianzheng is indeed unharmed, I will personally apologize to him on behalf of Fellow Daoist Qin..."</p><p>From the start of the negotiations, Elder Canghong had been aggressive, throwing out one enticing offer after another.  </p><p>Without lifting a finger, they had gained so much, including the most crucial secrets of the Demon Lord Ye.  </p><p>With a bit more negotiation, they could push Elder Canghong to agree to a few more conditions, making the deal acceptable.  </p><p>The sudden upheaval in the Sin Abyss had left them desperate for peace talks, which was understandable. They had been led along by Elder Canghong, and in the heat of the moment, they hadn't delved deeper into the implications.  </p><p>If Elder Tianzheng had indeed been secretly harmed by Demon Lord Ye, the Sin Abyss would now be left with only Elder Canghong as their sole top-tier expert, a lone pillar struggling to hold up the sky. Moreover, those who had consumed the Withered Origin Pills would continue to suffer from the lingering side effects, weakening the Sin Abyss' strength over time.</p><p>"We have heard the conditions of the Sin Abyss, but it is difficult for us to make a decision now. There is no need to continue the talks today. Farewell!"  </p><p>With a collective bow, the group turned and flew down from the cloud platform, leaving the Sin Abyss representatives with grim expressions.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi whispered, "The Star Eternal Sect is the foremost faction of the Sin Abyss. I have planted a spy within, though their status is far inferior to Fellow Daoist Qu. Still, they can keep us informed of any significant movements within the sect. Elder Canghong's eagerness for peace talks suggests that news of Elder Tianzheng's unexpected death may have leaked. We'll know the truth in a few days..."</p><p>---</p><p>**Palace of the Sin Deity**  </p><p>An unknown secret realm shrouded in darkness.  </p><p>Here, the darkness was so thick that one could not see their own hand, and the air was heavy with the stench of decay.  </p><p>Suddenly, a flash of crimson light illuminated the darkness, only to vanish as quickly as it appeared, swallowed once more by the void.  </p><p>Following this, faint footsteps echoed, as though someone was slowly approaching from the depths of the darkness.  </p><p>*Shhh... shhh...*  </p><p>The footsteps grew clearer, each step perfectly spaced in time.  </p><p>As the figure drew closer, a soft sigh emerged from the depths of the darkness.  </p><p>"How many years has it been? You've finally come..."  </p><p>The voice was hoarse, like the grating of two metal plates, resembling the desperate cry of someone lost in a desert, parched and dying.  </p><p>There was another person here, clearly trapped for a long time.  </p><p>*Hummm!*  </p><p>The void trembled slightly.  </p><p>Then, a faint azure light erupted, its source an ancient seal. The voice belonged to someone sealed within this ancient barrier.  </p><p>The mysterious figure struck the seal, activating its power.  </p><p>The newcomer stopped at the edge of the seal. Half of his pale face was illuminated by the azure light, while the other half remained hidden in darkness, creating an eerie visage. It was none other than Demon Lord Ye!  </p><p>Demon Lord Ye's breathing was ragged, his robes torn and bloodied. The pursuit by Elder Canghong had taken its toll, leaving him severely injured.  </p><p>Yet, his expression remained calm, his eyes indifferent, as though his wounds were of no concern. He gazed down at the ancient seal.  </p><p>Within the seal was an endless void of darkness, revealing nothing.  </p><p>The sealed figure's emotions suddenly surged with excitement, his voice sharp and piercing as he shouted, "Where is it? Did you succeed?"  </p><p>Without a word, Demon Lord Ye tossed something forward.  </p><p>*Thud!*  </p><p>A skeleton crashed to the ground—a Jade Bone and Brocade Skin.  </p><p>He had brought it with him.  </p><p>"Be careful!"  </p><p>The sealed figure cried out in distress.  </p><p>He seemed to examine the Jade Bone and Brocade Skin, falling silent for a moment before bursting into laughter. "Just as I expected! My younger brother, desperate to survive, would surely practice this forbidden art to refine his own body! What a pity, what a pity! Without blood sacrifices, he fell just short of perfecting the Jade Bone. Still, this body is more than enough to help me bear the seal and escape! Did you see him? Did you tell him it was I who sent you?"  </p><p>The sealed figure gloated, his tone dripping with malice, hinting at some deep-seated grudge.  </p><p>Demon Lord Ye lowered his gaze to the left foot of the Jade Bone and Brocade Skin.  </p><p>The little toe of the left foot stood out starkly from the rest of the jade-like skeleton—it was not jade but blood-red bone.  </p><p>"By the time I arrived, his consciousness had already dissipated," Demon Lord Ye shook his head. "However, he had been tirelessly seeking blood sacrifices. Had he devoured a few more Nascent Souls, killing him would have been far more difficult."  </p><p>"He's already dead?"  </p><p>The sealed figure's voice suddenly grew somber. After a brief silence, he added, "This Jade Bone alone isn't enough. What else do you have? Time is running out! Judging by your wretched state, not only are you severely injured, but your Blood Demon Avatar has also been destroyed. Don't tell me you failed? Back then, you were so determined, guarding against me with such vigilance, yet your boasts were so grand!"  </p><p>A flicker of disdain passed through Demon Lord Ye's eyes. With a wave of his sleeve, streams of light flew out from within.  </p><p>Among the lights was a spherical crystal—the core of the Nether Crystal Tower.  </p><p>The rest were Nascent Souls that Demon Lord Ye had captured and imprisoned.  </p><p>These Nascent Souls were filled with hatred, their faces twisted with malice, wishing they could tear Demon Lord Ye apart. Yet, they were completely restrained, powerless to resist, their only outlet being the most venomous curses they could muster.  </p><p>Upon seeing the crystal and the Nascent Souls, the sealed figure's tone immediately shifted, his voice filled with admiration. "Good! Good! I never thought you'd actually pull it off, deceiving the entire world! Truly ruthless! As expected of someone who managed to break free from my control and turn the tables on me!"  </p><p>Demon Lord Ye remained unmoved, his expression devoid of pride. Instead, he asked coldly, "I've gathered everything you asked for. What's next?"  </p><p>"Why the rush? The time isn't right yet. Once you help me escape this cursed place, I'll reveal everything to you, holding nothing back."  </p><p>The ancient seal flickered incessantly as the sealed figure grew impatient. "Everything is ready, save for the final push! Why haven't you thrown the Jade Bone over to help me break free?"  </p><p>Demon Lord Ye, however, paid no heed to the sealed figure's urging. He sat down cross-legged and said indifferently, "Since the time isn't right, we'll wait until it is before releasing you."  </p><p>"You!"  </p><p>The sealed figure roared in fury.  </p><p>The ancient seal trembled violently, but Demon Lord Ye closed his eyes and began meditating, completely ignoring the outburst.  </p><p>After venting his rage, the sealed figure calmed down and let out a few cold laughs, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "If you help me break the seal now, I can use this time to recover some of my strength, increasing our chances of success. This opportunity is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. You've schemed for nearly a millennium—can you truly bear to let it slip away? What are you afraid of? I've sworn a binding oath to you, vowing not to harm you. I've even allowed you to place restrictions on me. Heart Demon Oaths, Karmic Vows... I've sworn them all."  </p><p>Demon Lord Ye finally opened his eyes, lifting his eyelids slightly.  </p><p>"Heart Demon Oaths, as far as I know, are not unbreakable. As for Karmic Vows..."  </p><p>He paused, his gaze sweeping over the floating Nascent Souls before settling on the most prominent one—Elder Tianzheng.  </p><p>Unlike the others, who were consumed by fear or hatred, Elder Tianzheng's Nascent Soul sat in a meditative posture, calmly awaiting its fate.  </p><p>Demon Lord Ye gave Elder Tianzheng a deep look before stating firmly, "I have never believed in karma."  </p><p>The ancient seal flickered once more before gradually dimming.  </p><p>Silence returned to the void.</p>
