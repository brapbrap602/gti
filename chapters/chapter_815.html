<h1>Chapter 807: Split Wind Isles</h1><p>Qin Sang had barely formed the thought when the power surged towards his back.</p><p>In the next instant, cyan light pulsed across his spine, and a pair of wings unfurled with a 'whoosh'.</p><p>The wings were proportionate to Qin Sang's size, but their shape was identical to those of the celestial Qingluan bird.</p><p>Qin Sang, feeling the unfamiliar appendages on his back, stared at them in astonishment. The sensation of wings was alien to him, but he quickly grasped how to control them.</p><p>"Fly..."</p><p>With a gentle flap of his wings, Qin Sang, without employing any Daoist arts, slowly floated off the ground.  Initially a little wobbly, he soon gained control, maneuvering nimbly through the air.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gust of wind swept through the small courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure vanished in a flash of cyan light, reappearing in another corner a moment later. His speed was impressive.</p><p>"A divine ability manifesting wings of the Qingluan...am I human or demon now?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his shadow on the ground, puzzled and slightly apprehensive.</p><p>Landing back on the ground, Qin Sang withdrew his divine ability, and the wings vanished.</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief. He had no desire to abandon his humanity; it was good that he could retract them.</p><p>This was the heartland of the human race, a major island teeming with powerful cultivators.  Walking around with a pair of wings would be far too conspicuous. If mistaken for a demon, he would have no way to defend himself.</p><p>"These demon wings offer incredible speed. I'll focus on refining them. Once I break through to the third level of the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, my escape speed will increase dramatically!"</p><p>...</p><p>Tianxing City Marketplace.</p><p>Inside a shop, the owner chatted amicably with a man in a cyan robe.</p><p>Their gazes shifted towards the door as a young man hurried in.  When he entered, they both rose to greet him.</p><p>The shopkeeper, seemingly well-acquainted with the young man, said with a smile, "Fellow Daoist Qin, it's been a while. If it weren't for some good news I received today, it would have been difficult to meet you."</p><p>He then turned to the man in cyan and introduced him, "This is Fellow Daoist Qin I told you about.  Despite being a rogue cultivator, he achieved the mid Core Formation stage at such a young age.  He spent years hunting demons in the Demon Sea and now dedicates himself to cultivation on Mount Baogu. Those of us who know him are filled with admiration."</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang.</p><p>He procured all his cultivation necessities from these shops and was quite familiar with the owners, often entrusting them to gather information for him.</p><p>He had come because the shopkeeper had sent a message saying that a fellow Daoist had visited, mentioning an island called Spirit Turtle Island, which sounded rather peculiar, prompting Qin Sang to rush over.</p><p>The Canglang Sea was vast, and numerous islands bore the name Spirit Turtle Island. None of them were connected to Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>"Is this Fellow Daoist Wang?"</p><p>Qin Sang addressed both men politely, directing his question to the shopkeeper.</p><p>He discreetly observed the man. He appeared to be in his forties or fifties, possessed a refined air, and was a Core Formation cultivator.  He was also said to be a rogue cultivator.</p><p>The shopkeeper nodded and led them to a quiet room.  "Fellow Daoist Wang hails from the Split Wind Isles.  He mentioned an island near the Split Wind Isles called Spirit Turtle Island, where many strange things have occurred. I immediately thought of Fellow Daoist Qin. Perhaps this is the place your old friend went to."</p><p>"The Split Wind Isles..."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that it was an archipelago located in the southwestern region of the Canglang Sea, far from Tianxing Island.  It was a vast expanse, encompassing countless islands of varying sizes.</p><p>Far from central authority, the power dynamics there were naturally complex.  The southwest was frequently plagued by storms and sea beasts, making it a dangerous and unruly region, often left to its own devices.</p><p>Such places were not uncommon in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Things improved somewhat after the Demon Sea was cleared, but restoring stability remained an impossibility.</p><p>After returning, Qin Sang had studied the entire cartography of the Canglang Sea and had a clear memory of these key locations.</p><p>"The cartography doesn't seem to show a large island called Spirit Turtle Island within the Split Wind Isles."</p><p>Fellow Daoist Wang smiled faintly. "Fellow Daoist Qin won't find it on a map. Spirit Turtle Island is not a large island, and its location is extremely remote. In truth, most cultivators in the Split Wind Isles are unaware of its existence."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's interest was piqued. He promptly invited Fellow Daoist Wang to sit and personally poured him tea.</p><p>"Spirit Turtle Island was once a deserted island, quite small, and shaped like a spirit turtle.  Someone casually named it Spirit Turtle Island, and the name stuck.  No one expected it to conceal a spirit vein. Over two hundred years ago, a mysterious person discovered it and established a cave dwelling on the island..."</p><p>Fellow Daoist Wang took a sip of tea and began his tale.</p><p>"Initially, no one paid attention to such a barren island, and those who passed by didn't notice the cave dwelling.</p><p>"Several years later, people were surprised to find the island transformed into a sea of pink and purple peach blossoms, clearly the work of someone.</p><p>"Intrigued individuals, including those with malicious intent, ventured onto the island to investigate. However, they all perished mysteriously within, leaving no trace.</p><p>"The nearby cultivators were alarmed, realizing the island possessed a formidable formation and that the island's master was incredibly powerful. Gradually, they dared not provoke him.</p><p>"The island's master remained shrouded in mystery, never revealing himself publicly after occupying Spirit Turtle Island. No one knew his true appearance. The local powers, initially wary, seeing this, realized he was a dedicated recluse and relaxed their vigilance. Both sides maintained a peaceful coexistence.</p><p>"Decades later, the island's spiritual formation suddenly opened, and the island's master announced he would hold a night of Dharma discourse on Spirit Turtle Island, open to all rogue cultivators.  This news caused a stir, and fueled by curiosity about the island master's identity, cultivators flocked to the island.</p><p>"The various factions, initially suspecting the island master intended to establish a sect, were on high alert. Unexpectedly, the island master simply delivered his discourse. As dawn broke, he dismissed everyone and sealed the island once more, without uttering a single unnecessary word.</p><p>"The mysterious island master, speaking from amidst the peach blossoms, delivered a profound yet accessible discourse, elucidating subtle principles. The audience listened, captivated, and all gained insights.  Thereafter, every few years, the island master would hold another Dharma discourse, each time attracting numerous cultivators, even those from afar. The island master continued his practice of seclusion, never revealing his face.</p><p>"Some attempted to become his disciples, but all were refused.</p><p>"Those who attended his discourses addressed him with the respect due a teacher, indicating his genuine depth of knowledge.</p><p>"My hometown is relatively close to Spirit Turtle Island, and I had heard of it. Before I left to travel, the Spirit Turtle Island Master held another Dharma discourse."</p><p>Listening to Fellow Daoist Wang's account, Qin Sang grew increasingly convinced that this Spirit Turtle Island was the place he sought and that the island master was Senior Qingzhu!</p><p>Peaches, peach trees...</p><p>The peach trees on Sword Gate Mountain had flourished after Senior Qingzhu's departure, bearing incredibly sweet Red Jade peaches. This imagery was inextricably linked to Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>Upon hearing of the island filled with peach blossoms, Qin Sang's heart had skipped a beat.</p><p>He just couldn't fathom why Senior Qingzhu would hold Dharma discourses, guiding rogue cultivators.</p>
