<h1>Chapter 335: Past Experiences</h1><p>“Qin…”</p><p>Tan Hao opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, and then surprisingly said, “Tan Hao greets Uncle Qin…”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. He suddenly remembered the rule Yue Wu established when they first joined the Kuiyin Sect—seniority was determined by the order of entry, and whoever achieved Foundation Establishment first would be addressed as "Uncle," just like him.</p><p>Thinking about it now, it was so ridiculous.</p><p>Anyone who chose to cultivate with the Yama Banner couldn't possibly achieve Foundation Establishment. Yue Wu's words were full of lies!</p><p>Qin Sang said helplessly, “Brother Tan, do we need to be so formal? The Kuiyin Sect is gone, the past is like a dream, we are both free now, why bother with those so-called sect rules? Just call me Brother Qin.”</p><p>In fact, in the Kuiyin Sect, Qin Sang was the junior, and the Tan brothers joined earlier, making them seniors.</p><p>With the current disparity in their cultivation levels, Tan Hao definitely wouldn't dare call him junior.</p><p>“Brother Qin…”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang say this, Tan Hao's expression relaxed a lot, and the past camaraderie brought a touch of closeness to his tone. He said gratefully, “Thanks to running into you, Brother Qin, otherwise I would be a dead soul at the hands of that villain.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head nonchalantly, “Brother Tan, you misunderstand. It wasn't a chance encounter, I followed you here. Your mask is quite impressive; I couldn't see through your disguise. I felt you looked familiar at the auction, and later, hearing your voice in the black market made me even more certain.  I noticed someone following you, so I came to have a look, and unexpectedly, it was you.”</p><p>“So Brother Qin was also at the auction and the black market. You saw my embarrassing display then.”</p><p>Tan Hao smiled sheepishly, summoning the mask and showing it to Qin Sang.  “I obtained this by chance. It's said to be refined from the skull of a late-stage Spirit Demon beast. It can disguise one's aura as that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>As long as I don't make a move, it won't be exposed.</p><p>Thanks to this mask, I've been able to survive in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield these years.</p><p>However, every time I use the mask, I have to use all my divine sense to maintain it. My physique is different from ordinary people, so I can't conceal my figure with other artifacts. It's truly frustrating…”</p><p>Compared to their first encounter in the You Mountain market, Tan Hao had undergone earth-shattering changes.</p><p>Back then, he would stand up for what's right, unafraid of offending anyone.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to hold a banquet to thank him, but Tan Hao flatly refused, saying he acted according to his conscience and sought no reward. Tan Jie had to smooth things over for him, a clear sign of his youthful pride.</p><p>Now, although Tan Hao still had a rugged appearance, his words and actions were very cautious, without any impropriety. His mind had become much more refined and tactful.</p><p>He must have gone through a lot of hardship over the years.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and asked curiously, “Brother Tan, the Kuiyin Sect suddenly suffered a great upheaval. I luckily escaped and thought I would never see you again, but unexpectedly we meet again today. How have you been these years? Have you joined another sect? And...why isn't Tan Jie with you? Did you two brothers get separated?”</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's question, Tan Hao's eyes dimmed. He looked around and said, "This isn't a good place to talk. I have a cave dwelling outside Shadow Pass. If you don't mind, Brother Qin, come with me to my cave dwelling, and we can talk on the way."</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>The two of them summoned their flying light and flew towards Shadow Pass.</p><p>“Back then, you and Senior Sister Shi Hong both broke through to the sixth level. Senior Sister Shi Hong was taken as a disciple by Yue Wu, but your whereabouts were unknown. Yue Wu said you went to the outer sect to manage affairs.  We never saw you again until the Kuiyin Sect was destroyed…”</p><p>Tan Hao recounted Qin Sang's experiences after leaving the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and said frankly, “That’s right. Back then, Senior Sister Shi Hong and I went to see Uncle Yue Wu.  Senior Sister Shi Hong was favored by Uncle Yue Wu because of her talent. The rest of us, due to our inferior talent, were sent out of the sect.</p><p>Actually, Yue Wu was lying. We weren’t managing affairs, but were threatened and sent out by the sect leader on dangerous missions.</p><p>Fortunately, I was outside the mountain gate at the time and wasn't affected by the Yuanzhao Sect's counterattack. I sensed something was wrong and chose to flee, which is how I luckily escaped the Kuiyin Sect's clutches.</p><p>I heard that the Yuanzhao Sect launched a massive counterattack and has now occupied the Kuiyin Sect's mountain gate. I wonder what the situation was like back then, and how did you escape?”</p><p>Tan Hao glanced at Qin Sang, hesitation appearing on his face. Instead of answering Qin Sang’s question, he asked hesitantly, “Since you have already left the Kuiyin Sect, Brother Qin, and become a Foundation Establishment expert… did you disperse your cultivation and start over, or did you simply not cultivate with the Yama Banner?”</p><p>“It seems, Brother Tan, you also noticed something amiss with the Yama Banner.”</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for Tan Hao to ask this question, and immediately countered.</p><p>Although Tan Hao hadn't reached Foundation Establishment, he had surpassed the tenth level of Qi Refining. The fact that he hadn't been refined into a tool spirit meant he must have discovered the secret of the Yama Banner.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang knew that Tan Hao hadn’t joined any other sect after leaving the Kuiyin Sect, but had remained a rogue cultivator, venturing alone into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>If Tan Hao had dispersed his cultivation and started over, reaching the thirteenth level of Qi Refining again, such perseverance was admirable.</p><p>Qin Sang admired his tenacity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Tan Hao gave a bitter laugh and said something that surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>“It wasn’t me who discovered the secret of the Yama Banner, but my younger brother, Tan Jie.</p><p>When we first entered the Kuiyin Sect, Tan Jie had some doubts about the Yama Banner.</p><p>But later, finding that the entire sect was cultivating with it, Tan Jie thought he might be overthinking things.  Cultivating with the Yama Banner definitely carried risks, but the numerous Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Kuiyin Sect couldn't all be fake.</p><p>Moreover, the temptation of the Yama Banner was too great. As they say, fortune favors the bold, and we couldn't bear to give it up.</p><p>After discussing it, my brother and I made a decision. He had always been clever and meticulous, able to quickly spot anomalies and adapt. So, he would use the Yama Banner for cultivation.</p><p>I continued to cultivate as before.</p><p>This way, if anything really went wrong, there would still be a chance to struggle. And as long as Tan Jie could reach Foundation Establishment, I wouldn’t have to worry about cultivation resources.</p><p>Since then, fearing the Kuiyin Sect would discover our secret, I rarely left the cave, and Tan Jie took care of everything.</p><p>If I had known this would happen, I would have rather switched places with Tan Jie!”</p><p>Tan Hao recounted his story with deep sorrow and regret in his voice, moving Qin Sang.</p><p>A flash of lightning struck Qin Sang's mind as he recalled his time in the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>No wonder he rarely saw Tan Hao during his years in the Kuiyin Sect. Tan Hao hadn't even attended a single one of Yue Wu's monthly lectures.  He had assumed it was because Tan Hao was dedicated to his cultivation, but there was actually such a hidden story.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Tan Hao’s face and asked softly, “I wonder where Brother Tan Jie is now…”</p><p>Since Tan Jie chose to cultivate with the Yama Banner, and he wasn't present now, with only Tan Hao traveling alone…</p><p>Could he already be…</p>
