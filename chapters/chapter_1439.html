<h1>Chapter 1431: The Dan Ding Assembly</h1><p>Chapter 1431: The Dan Ding Assembly</p><p>Initially, the situation was urgent.  After Qin Sang broke the Jin Ding Buddha Hall's restriction, he only glanced around quickly.</p><p>Buddha statues, stone statues, offering tables.</p><p>Corpses, magical treasures.</p><p>It could be confirmed that there were no written inscriptions.</p><p>The seven-story pagoda was hidden within the Guanyin statue; an additional shrine encased it, placed in the center of the offering table, holding a position of greater importance than the spiritual fungus or the Ruyi Orb.</p><p>This arrangement couldn't be without reason.</p><p>"Could it be the status symbol of some senior cultivator, holding special significance to the Jing Hai Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered this, his eyes narrowed as he stared at the seven-story pagoda.  "That person's... relics, worshipped as sacred objects?"</p><p>He recalled the stone statue that shouldn't have been in the Buddha Hall.</p><p>The stone statue and the Buddha statue were given equal status, worshipped together in the Buddha Hall – a desecration of the Buddha, a desecration of their own faith.</p><p>The Jing Hai Sect shouldn't have made such a mistake; even a life-saving grace wouldn't justify this from Buddhist disciples.</p><p>Qin Sang became intensely curious about the stone statue.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tan Hao didn't know anything about it.</p><p>The stone statue was lifelike, its features distinct.</p><p>If this person was a powerful senior cultivator from Beihai, it shouldn't be difficult to investigate.</p><p>"Let's investigate this person's identity first, then we'll decide what to do."</p><p>Qin Sang temporarily put away the seven-story pagoda.</p><p>Afterwards,</p><p>Qin Sang remained in his cave dwelling, secluded from the world.</p><p>He refined the demonic fire and the Ruyi Orb while contemplating how to modify the  降魔杵 (Jiang Mo Chu –  let's call it the Demon-Subduing Pestle), and using the Pestle to study Buddhist methods of refining weapons. His gains were considerable.</p><p>Since it was only a change in appearance, not an improvement in the Pestle's rank, it didn't require extremely precious materials.</p><p>Qin Sang searched through his Qian Jun Ring and found a few items that were sufficient.</p><p>More than two months later,</p><p>Qin Sang activated the demonic fire and reforged the Demon-Subduing Pestle.</p><p>In his hands, the imposing Demon-Subduing Pestle underwent a dramatic transformation.  The Buddhist patterns disappeared, the surface bulging into spikes until it became a spiked club!</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang wielded it, the image of the powerfully built Tan Hao smashing opponents with a spiked club flashing through his mind. A slight smile played on his lips.</p><p>Putting away the spiked club, he cultivated for a short time before the cave dwelling's restriction was suddenly triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, opened the door, and saw Tan Hao had returned.</p><p>"Try it."</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the spiked club to him.</p><p>"Is the reforging complete?"</p><p>Tan Hao caught the spiked club, his face beaming with joy. He handled it lovingly, twirling it a few times before following Qin Sang's instructions to refine it.  The spiked club immediately glowed with a faint blue light, clearly a formidable weapon.</p><p>"I've done my best to conceal it. However, the essence of the Buddhist treasure cannot be changed. Once you engage in combat, your opponent will still be able to sense the unique fluctuations of the Buddhist restriction. Don't leave any loose ends."</p><p>Qin Sang warned him, his tone changing as he asked, "What did you find out?"</p><p>Tan Hao happily put away the spiked club and said seriously, "The ripples caused by the Jing Hai Sect haven't subsided. Many cultivators are still lingering in the Kong Ling Sea, some even traveling great distances to get there. However, the traces of the Jing Hai Sect have been erased by the blazing flames, and for now, no one has found the treasure. There are a lot of swindlers taking advantage of the situation. In the beginning, Yuan Ying masters frequently appeared, but they haven't been seen lately..."</p><p>Then, Tan Hao recounted the key points of his investigation.</p><p>"The seal's collapse caused countless cultivators to die, an uncountable number. The islands near the Kong Ling Sea are filled with mourning. However, apart from the phenomenon of the blazing flames, there were no other anomalies, and there was no major battle between the Hun Mo Elder and the other Yuan Ying cultivators.  After the phenomenon subsided, they searched the area again before leaving."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "If there wasn't a major battle, it seems the demonic being inside the seal is dead. Of course, it's also possible they used some method to deceive everyone, but that doesn't concern us.  Tell me, did you find anything about Qi and Wang?"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded. "The identities of those two aren't hard to find out.  The Qi cultivator and the Ji Jie Island's abbot, Jie Zhenren, are both major powers near the Kong Ling Sea, and they've always been at odds, with frequent clashes between their descendants. He didn't establish a sect, but he has eight disciples. The female cultivator surnamed Wang recently achieved Yuan Ying, reportedly his Dao companion."</p><p>Qin Sang silently repeated Jie Zhenren's name, knowing that the second person who attacked them was him.</p><p>However, this person was backed by the Hun Mo Elder, so it was not advisable to provoke him for now.</p><p>Tan Hao continued, "At first, I didn't dare to directly inquire about the eight disciples, but soon I heard rumors that the island where the Qi cultivator's cave dwelling was located was attacked by a mysterious expert, and everyone on the island, both mortals and cultivators, was completely annihilated, leaving not a single survivor.</p><p>However, rumors circulated that the eight senior disciples mysteriously disappeared before the massacre, their whereabouts unknown, but the truth remains unconfirmed.”</p><p>The eight senior disciples' disappearance might mean they were taken away.</p><p>They were unaware of the events at the Jing Hai Sect, and Qi and Wang couldn't have foreseen that a chance encounter would cause such a huge uproar, making preemptive measures impossible.</p><p>This suggests that one of the three Mu leaders survived.</p><p>Most likely, it's Mu, the highest-cultivation leader, who also possesses the Four-Transformation Tidal Crab.</p><p>Qin Sang felt slightly relieved.  This made finding him for a trade much easier.</p><p>“These are the individuals and organizations in the Boundless Sea skilled in alchemy and accepting commissions,” Tan Hao handed him a jade slip.</p><p>Unless it's a major event like the Jing Hai Sect incident, Yuan Ying masters rarely appear in the mortal world.</p><p>Golden Core cultivators are the main players in the cultivation world.</p><p>Tan Hao's collected information was very detailed.</p><p>“The Boundless Sea's most reputable and skilled alchemist is surprisingly the Grand Elder of the Nine Stars Assembly.”</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised by this information.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang ruled out the Nine Stars Assembly.</p><p>Having inquired about the Kong Ling Sea at the Nine Stars Assembly while in the Jing Hai Sect, this incident would undoubtedly trigger suspicion.  It's best to avoid further contact with them.</p><p>He quickly scanned the rest, his brow gradually furrowing.</p><p>Other options either lacked skill or had poor reputations.</p><p>While he wasn't afraid of them coveting his treasures, he preferred to minimize trouble.</p><p>“Ah, the Dan Ding Assembly.”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fixed on one organization, discovering it was also a merchant guild, backed by the prestigious Dan Ding Mountain sect in the Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>Dan Ding Mountain is renowned for both alchemy and artifact refinement, comparable to a combination of the Taiyi Dan Sect and the Xu Ling Sect, and boasts an excellent reputation.</p><p>He had originally planned to go to the Crescent Moon Realm if he couldn't find anyone in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>He decided on the Dan Ding Assembly.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, exchanged a few words with Tan Hao, and returned to his quiet room for meditation.</p><p>More than half a year passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>During this time, Tan Hao went out to investigate several times, with similar results.</p><p>The turmoil caused by the Jing Hai Sect seemed to have completely subsided.</p><p>A figure broke the surface of the water, skimming the sea, flying westward—it was Qin Sang.</p><p>He planned to go to the Dan Ding Assembly immediately to commission the refining of Concealing Fragrance Pills.</p><p>The Dan Ding Assembly is not a local force, and its outposts are sparsely located.</p><p>Qin Sang chose the nearest outpost, an island called Blue Star Island, known for its thriving commerce. Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry, taking over half a month to reach his destination.</p>
