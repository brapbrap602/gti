<h1>Chapter 1248: The Traitor</h1><p>Chapter 1248: The Traitor</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, are you injured?”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Si Di’s pale complexion and felt a chill in her heart.</p><p>Had the two sides already clashed in a great battle?</p><p>Si Di touched his shoulder, saying, “I got separated from the others. It wasn't the members of the Abyss, but a swarm of Blood Souls. I was unfortunately scratched by them, and the evil energy entered my body. I’ve just taken a spirit pill, and I’m fine now.”</p><p>“A swarm of Blood Souls?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. “Were the other Daoists also scattered?”</p><p>Si Di nodded. “It happened so suddenly. We were dealing with a difficult restriction when, somehow, we disturbed them. Countless Blood Souls suddenly attacked. Initially, we didn’t know that the Blood Souls were immortal, and we suffered a great loss due to our carelessness. Our formation broke, and we were scattered by the Blood Souls. We decided to escape separately and meet at the designated location after getting away. I spent a long time circling around the Blood Souls pursuing me before I managed to shake them off and find a place to heal.”</p><p>The two briefly discussed and decided to move together.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang frequently summoned the fat chicken. Si Di was curious but seeing Qin Sang unwilling to explain, he didn’t ask further.</p><p>…</p><p>Center of the basin.</p><p>This was where the blood mist was densest, thick as blood.  Two huge blood-red gates stood within the mist!</p><p>Countless mysterious runes covered the surface of the gates.</p><p>However, the gates were now pitted and cracked, with even some gaps. Through the gaps, one could vaguely see the scene within.</p><p>Tall towers stood, radiating a chilling aura.</p><p>While showing signs of collapse and decay, it was relatively better than other places.</p><p>Before the gates, a cleared space held several figures, all Abyss cultivators. Qing Jun and the others were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Everyone was facing the gates, arranged in a fan shape.</p><p>Two people were at the front.</p><p>One, clad in a blood-red cloak, with a withered face, was Ye Laomo, whose demonic name echoed throughout the Northern Heavens Realm, known as the world's greatest expert!</p><p>Beside him stood a white-haired elder with a refined and scholarly air, Tian Zheng Daochang, the Sect Master of Xing Heng Sect within the Abyss, whose cultivation was only slightly inferior to Ye Laomo’s.</p><p>With them leading, everyone launched a combined attack on the blood gates, their attacks pouring out like a waterfall, shaking the gates violently.</p><p>“Those fellows from the Two Realms Alliance must have encountered the Blood Souls, right? Ye Lao’s blood magic is truly extraordinary. Using a blood demon avatar, he lured away the Blood Souls.  Not only did these Blood Souls not become a problem, but they even helped us to use a strategy of ‘using a tiger to devour a wolf,’ easily blocking our opponents.”</p><p>A Yuan Ying cultivator paused, took a moment to recover, turned towards the depths of the blood mist, and chuckled darkly.</p><p>This person, known as Xuansi Daoist, wore a spider-patterned robe, his eyes were sinister, and his lips an unnatural purplish-blue—a clear sign of a demonic cultivator.</p><p>“Daoist Xuansi makes it sound easy, but Ye Lao’s blood demon avatar is comparable to his real body’s cultivation. It’s not something everyone can possess. Only such a powerful avatar can secretly lure away so many Blood Souls.”</p><p>Next to him, an elder in black robes, also a demonic cultivator, expressed immense admiration for Ye Laomo, immediately showering him with excessive praise.</p><p>The Abyss wasn't a monolithic entity; like the Lesser Cold Realm, there was a struggle between righteous and demonic cultivators, though this conflict was overshadowed by more pressing matters.</p><p>An uncomfortable righteous cultivator interjected, “Don't get too excited.  The Two Realms Alliance has many powerful experts. It's uncertain how long those Blood Souls can hold them off. These blood gates are hard to break, so the two Daoists should focus on assisting Daochang and Ye Lao in breaking the gates.”</p><p>The two who had spoken before exchanged a look, showing displeasure but didn’t argue, instead whispering amongst themselves.</p><p>“Last time at the Crime God Palace, we broke through numerous ancient restrictions to find the demon who was suppressed there. The demon was tortured beyond recognition, and we went overboard, ultimately only obtaining some fragmented memories from its remnant soul. Yet, we still gained such a great benefit, suppressing the other forces so they couldn’t lift their heads. I wonder how great the harvest will be this time!”</p><p>Xuansi Daoist was filled with anticipation, almost unable to contain himself.</p><p>The elder in black robes chuckled, equally unable to hide his excitement, “According to the demon, a traitor from the Ziwei Palace is imprisoned in this Blood Prison, someone who must be extremely knowledgeable about the Ziwei Palace! As long as we capture this person, all the treasures in the Ziwei Palace will be within our grasp. The old ghosts from the Lesser Cold Realm and Tianxing Alliance, what can they compete with us with? We'll cut off their supplies! How laughable that they think their long-standing presence in the Ziwei Palace will exclude us.”</p><p>Saying this, the black-robed elder looked up, his gaze passing through the cracks in the blood gate into the interior.</p><p>Xuansi Daoist chuckled, "While Ziwei Palace is impressive, in my humble opinion, his cultivation techniques and secrets are secondary.  His memories of the ancient era are far more valuable. We must learn from him how the world became this way, and if there's a path beyond the Endless Storm to a wider world.  We mustn't repeat the mistakes of our predecessors and die with regrets.  This time, we must proceed cautiously; capture him alive.  We can't repeat the last incident where we left him only a remnant soul, obtaining only fragmented memories."</p><p>"Xuansi, your ambition is considerable. But even if a path exists, how could we possibly traverse the Endless Storm? How can we ensure we don't get lost?  Improving our own strength is paramount,"</p><p>The black-robed elder fired off a series of questions, each hitting the mark.</p><p>Xuansi Daoist's expression soured.</p><p>Seeing this, the black-robed elder quickly changed his tone, saying,  "However, it's premature to discuss this now. This seal is weaker than the one at the Sinful God Palace.  The Ziwei Palace traitor, imprisoned here, suffers less torment and suppression.  His remaining strength is unknown, but he will likely not be as easy to subdue as the Demon Lord.  Also, last time, nearly all of us participated, working together; it seemed easy.  This time, we were unexpectedly disrupted by the Moonlit Demon King, forcing us to split our forces.  With Cang Hong Daoist and the others guarding the Sky Traverse Plateau, our strength is diminished. We must be extra careful."</p><p>Xuansi Daoist, having cultivated to this level, wouldn't be angered by a few words.</p><p>Upon hearing the black-robed elder’s words, Xuansi Daoist nodded slightly, agreeing with his caution, but his expression wasn't as serious, "A weaker seal suggests his cultivation is also lower.  This isn't an ordinary seal; it's a place of punishment like the Sinful God Palace! Since we began monitoring Blood Lake, we've noticed that every ten years, he makes a disturbance when the seal weakens.  Each disturbance was weaker than the last until, over a decade ago, he fell completely silent.  Did Elder Ye wait another cycle, confirming he's as depleted as the Demon Lord, before deciding to act now?"</p><p>Their conversation wasn't private.</p><p>Others, seeing the blood gate fissure widening, whispered amongst themselves.</p><p>Tianzheng Daoist, overhearing, glanced at Elder Ye, who sat like an ancient pine, expressionless, and ignored them, focusing on breaching the gate.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>I intended to rest yesterday after returning, but I overslept. Fortunately, I woke up early.</p>
