<h1>Chapter 1598: The Land of Ascension</h1><p>Realist Hegao, with his profound cultivation and steady temperament, still took a long time to compose himself.</p><p>The Soul-Attracting Mirror was shattered.</p><p>This not only concerned Grand Magus Danyu's safety but would also have an immeasurable impact on the Eight Sceneries Sect and even the entire cultivation world!</p><p>Rumors of a Soul Formation cultivator's demise were spreading throughout the cultivation world.</p><p>Realist Hegao scoffed at this, and neither the upper nor lower echelons of the Eight Sceneries Sect were affected by such gossip.</p><p>Soul Formation cultivators stood at the pinnacle of the world.</p><p>Only they knew how formidable a Soul Formation cultivator's power truly was.</p><p>Realist Hegao was more inclined to believe that the Soul Formation cultivators were plotting something. With his current cultivation and status, he wasn't qualified to participate in the schemes of Soul Formation masters. He would naturally know when the time was right.</p><p>Moreover, during the beast hunt, Realist Zilei had produced the Grand Magus's decree.</p><p>Never had he expected that the decree was a forgery!</p><p>“I remember, Senior Brother, you said that Master left with Saint Huiguang back then…”</p><p>Realist Hegao still couldn't believe this fact, racking his brains to recall what his Sect Leader Senior Brother had said before, trying to discern what was true and what was false!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Realist Zilei confirmed that this statement was true.</p><p>Realist Hegao immediately grasped the key point, “Could it be that Saint Huiguang also…”</p><p>Since then, Saint Huiguang hadn't appeared either. His cultivation sanctuary, Small Boundless Mountain, had even been raided by thieves, yet Saint Huiguang hadn't manifested.</p><p>It was precisely this incident that caused the news of the Soul Formation cultivator's disappearance to spread widely, triggering a series of subsequent events that escalated to this day.</p><p>Two Soul Formation masters from two sects had vanished.</p><p>The Sect Leader and Abbot Xingji of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery should have had a tacit understanding.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Realist Zilei shook his head, "I don't know."</p><p>Realist Hegao was stunned.</p><p>Was there something more between the two sects?</p><p>Realist Zilei’s tone was unreadable, "The Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and Xingji are too composed."</p><p>Realist Hegao suddenly understood his Sect Leader Senior Brother's meaning.</p><p>He wanted to say that, from an outsider's perspective, the Eight Sceneries Sect appeared the same. Even he, the Sect Leader's Junior Brother, only sensed something amiss recently when his Senior Brother forcefully intruded into the Hall of No Desires and was injured, and later arranged for him to put on a show in front of Su Zinan.</p><p>Out of trust in his Sect Leader Senior Brother, Realist Hegao meticulously carried out his orders, never asking a single question.</p><p>Now he knew that his Sect Leader Senior Brother had been silently bearing a tremendous burden, but he must have made many unknown arrangements.</p><p>“The Sweet Dew Zen Monastery… should also have a Soul-Binding Treasure, right?” Realist Hegao hesitated.</p><p>Such treasures had range limitations.</p><p>Ordinary Soul Lamps were limited to the Central Continent.</p><p>The Soul-Attracting Mirror had a much wider range. Even if Grand Magus Danyu left the Central Continent and entered the depths of the Storm Belt, it could still reflect his fortune or misfortune. This was the very reason why the two realists were so shocked.</p><p>Presumably, the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery also possessed similar treasures.</p><p>If Saint Huiguang's Soul-Binding Treasure was also shattered, even if Abbot Xingji made the same decision as his Sect Leader Senior Brother to suppress the news, he would definitely take action in secret.</p><p>For so many years, his Sect Leader Senior Brother had been paying attention and would have noticed some clues.</p><p>Realist Zilei silently shook his head.</p><p>It was precisely because they hadn't detected any signs of unusual activity from the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery that they couldn't be certain.</p><p>Cultivators had diverse temperaments. Not everyone in the Eight Sceneries Sect was willing to leave behind a Soul-Attracting Mirror or a Soul Lamp.</p><p>It wasn't unprecedented for Soul Formation cultivators to leave the Central Continent and travel abroad, encountering fortuitous encounters and being gone for centuries.</p><p>If Saint Huiguang hadn't left a Soul-Binding Treasure and had met with an accident outside, the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery wouldn't be aware.</p><p>If Saint Huiguang had left a Soul-Binding Treasure and it hadn't shattered, meaning his life was not in danger, the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery would be even less likely to act rashly!</p><p>After a moment of silence, Realist Zilei recalled something and said, “I calculated that someone spotted Saint Huiguang in the East Sea. This rumor emerged after Master's Soul-Attracting Mirror shattered. At that time, Saint Huiguang should have been traveling with the Holy Fox King. By then, Master had already disappeared…”</p><p>Realist Hegao gasped, finally understanding what Sect Leader Senior Brother was suspecting.</p><p>Two Soul Formation cultivators traveling together, yet only Master's Soul-Attracting Mirror shattered…</p><p>Was it an accident, or was it deliberate?</p><p>The Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and the Eight Sceneries Sect were known as the two great Immortal Sects, not because they didn't want to dominate the cultivation world, but because neither could overcome the other.</p><p>Moreover, the relationship between the two sects wasn't simply a matter of conflicting interests!</p><p>“That time in the Hall of No Desires, Senior Brother, you deliberately acted impulsively and intentionally injured yourself?” Although Realist Hegao was asking, he used an affirmative tone.</p><p>Back then, Realist Zilei's aggressive assault in the Hall of No Desires resulted in him being seriously injured, causing great anxiety among all the cultivators of the Eight Sceneries Sect.</p><p>The severity of his injuries was alarming. A slight misstep could have ruined his foundation. It would take at least a century of recuperation to recover.</p><p>Looking back now, Realist Zilei’s aura was full and robust, showing no sign of injury whatsoever.</p><p>His intention was obvious: to put on a show for the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, and for the world!</p><p>For the time being, they hadn't detected any movements from the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>But remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect had begun to surface.</p><p>Although Realist Hegao still didn't know what his Senior Brother's purpose was in luring the snake out of its hole.</p><p>“What about the ferocious beasts? Why did Senior Brother forge the beast hunting decree back then? Could the beast rampage also be related to Master’s disappearance?” Realist Hegao had too many questions in his mind, eagerly voicing them one by one.</p><p>"Before Master left, he left behind three words—The heavens have changed."</p><p>Before Realist Hegao could comprehend the hidden meaning behind these three words, Realist Zilei gently touched the fragments of the Soul-Attracting Mirror with his fingertips and said in a deep voice, “It’s time to tell Junior Brother some secrets. Haven't you always been curious about how to ascend, and why only Soul Formation cultivators can ascend? Because the Land of Ascension is in—the Returning Ruins of the East Sea!”</p><p>…</p><p>After Qin Sang made a deal with the shadowy figure, he traveled north by land and returned to Flying Cloud Crossing.</p><p>He wasn't in a hurry to see Jiang Mu and claim the Meteorite Divine Whip.</p><p>The Six Continents Hall needed time to investigate the origins of the Meteorite Divine Whip. He could simply inquire about the results later.</p><p>Qin Sang also wasn't worried that the Six Continents Hall would recognize the Meteorite Divine Whip's true value and keep it for themselves.</p><p>The Meteorite Divine Whip itself wasn't particularly valuable. The Six Continents Hall could research it however they liked. It was because of its connection to the Ancient Devil and the Ascension Platform that Qin Sang valued it.</p><p>If the Six Continents Hall acted unusually, it would mean they also knew about the Ascension Platform, which would actually be a good thing, saving Qin Sang the trouble of investigating.</p><p>As long as one's cultivation was sufficient, anyone could ascend on the Ascension Platform.</p><p>If he, a great cultivator, approached them, could they possibly refuse him a spot?</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang placed the Near Dragon Saliva and the Thousand-Knot Divine Net before him.</p><p>He set the Near Dragon Saliva aside first and attempted to refine the Thousand-Knot Divine Net.</p><p>The shadowy figure had voluntarily erased his mark on the Thousand-Knot Divine Net, so Qin Sang only needed to refine it step by step.</p><p>When inactive, the Thousand-Knot Divine Net automatically shrunk into a silver ball the size of a baby's fist.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang’s divine sense touched the Thousand-Knot Divine Net, the silver ball radiated brilliantly, as if coating the entire cave dwelling and Qin Sang himself in a layer of silver paint.</p><p>With a ‘swish,’ the Thousand-Knot Divine Net suddenly unfolded, transforming into a thin, large net that hovered above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Currently, the Thousand-Knot Divine Net was unclaimed, its form different from before, clearly revealing the individual silver threads woven into the net.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, sensing this magical treasure purely with his divine sense. The feedback he received was a comfortable sense of affinity, truly worthy of being a divine sense treasure.</p><p>After a brief sensing, Qin Sang attempted to refine the Thousand-Knot Divine Net.</p><p>After just one hour, the Thousand-Knot Divine Net began to change. Starting from the edges, the silver light gradually dimmed, and the silver threads took on an ethereal quality.</p><p>This indicated that the Thousand-Knot Divine Net was merging with Qin Sang's divine sense.</p><p>When the entire silver net transformed like this, it would signify that Qin Sang had completely refined the treasure.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze filled with excitement. The process of refining the Thousand-Knot Divine Net was smoother and faster than he had anticipated. The power of the Soul-Nourishing Wood was manifesting, making his cultivation of divine sense secret arts and refinement of divine sense treasures twice as effective!</p><p>After refining a corner of the Thousand-Knot Divine Net, he could store the treasure in his Purple Mansion, summoning and dismissing it at will. Qin Sang temporarily paused the refinement and looked towards the Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>The Immortal Grease Bee Dragon's nest was woven into a silk pouch to prevent the Near Dragon Saliva's power from dissipating.</p><p>Qin Sang took the silk pouch into his palm; it felt soft to the touch.</p><p>Imitating the actions of the Daoist in the robe, Qin Sang made the pouch transparent, glanced at it a few times, and then unhesitatingly tore it open. Simultaneously, his divine sense surged forth, enveloping the Near Dragon Saliva completely and bringing it before him.</p><p>The golden Near Dragon Saliva was exceptionally pure, emitting a unique Dao韵 (Dao rhythm), intoxicating to the senses.</p><p>“This is the essence condensed from a Fifth Transformation spirit insect!”</p><p>Qin Sang marveled inwardly.</p><p>He thanked Xiao Xiangzi. Without the Spirit-Calming Incense, he would have missed out on this treasure.</p><p>He didn't feel any immediate impact.</p><p>The Daoist in the robe wouldn't tell Qin Sang how to refine the Near Dragon Saliva, so he could only experiment little by little.</p><p>Enveloping the Near Dragon Saliva with his divine sense and bringing it into his Purple Mansion, Qin Sang focused his mind on the Jade Buddha.</p><p>The Buddha’s light rippled slightly, allowing the Near Dragon Saliva to enter Qin Sang’s Nascent Soul.</p><p>Within his Nascent Soul, there was also the Wandering Sword.</p><p>Over the years, whenever Qin Sang had free time, he would perform the "Nascent Soul Refinement Art" on the Wandering Sword. Although it was still far from developing sentience, Qin Sang could feel a subtle, indescribable connection with the Wandering Sword, closer than before.</p><p>Yun Youzi's True Spirit also seemed to have stabilized slightly.</p><p>This change was still subtle, perceptible only because the Wandering Sword was Qin Sang's natal magic treasure.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang focused all his attention on the Near Dragon Saliva, his divine sense like a knife, carefully peeling off a thin layer.  Based on past experience, he would use a simple and crude method, forcibly refining the Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>In an instant, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The Near Dragon Saliva, originally solid, immediately melted into a golden liquid when Qin Sang attempted to refine it. The relatively stable energy within also began to surge uncontrollably.</p><p>The Immortal Grease Bee Dragon offspring could consume the Near Dragon Saliva as easily as drinking water.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that he couldn't directly absorb the Near Dragon Saliva; he had to first restrain and regulate this energy. If he didn't do this, the Near Dragon Saliva's energy would become increasingly chaotic until it exploded, rendering all his efforts futile.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The silver light of the Thousand-Knot Divine Net had only recently faded when the cave dwelling was once again bathed in golden light.</p><p>A burst of golden light erupted before Qin Sang, as if streaks of delicate golden lightning appeared and vanished just as quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang failed to pacify this portion of the Near Dragon Saliva and didn’t dare let it explode within his body. He could only move it outside, watching helplessly as it dissipated.</p><p>Wasting such a precious treasure pained Qin Sang greatly, but thankfully, his divine sense was powerful. After this experience, he had a clear idea.</p><p>He didn't rush into a second attempt, instead entering deep meditation, recalling every subtle change in the Near Dragon Saliva and making deductions.</p><p>Days passed within the cave dwelling, oblivious to the changing light outside.</p><p>During this time, the Near Dragon Saliva exploded once more.</p><p>On the third attempt, Qin Sang finally managed to stabilize the energy.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, he discovered that the entire Near Dragon Saliva was beginning to melt and was about to erupt. The transformation was happening much faster than the Daoist in the robe had indicated!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have time to curse the Daoist for his deceitful nature and exerted all his effort to finally stabilize the Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>In the end, a drop of golden liquid appeared within his Nascent Soul, shining alongside the Wandering Sword.</p><p>But this was only the beginning. Refinement was the greatest hurdle.</p><p>When he attempted refinement, Qin Sang finally sensed the strange energy that the Daoist in the robe had mentioned.</p><p>As soon as he began to refine the Near Dragon Saliva, he was assaulted by it.</p><p>That energy wasn't simply force; it seemed to contain the unique Dao rhythm of the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon. It was a great tonic for its offspring, but a danger to outsiders, and must be purged.</p><p>Allowing this energy to surge through him could, at best, severely injure his Nascent Soul, and at worst, shatter his foundation.</p><p>A scene that delighted Qin Sang unfolded.</p><p>At this moment, the Jade Buddha finally displayed its power. His Nascent Soul, as solid as a rock, remained unaffected.</p><p>However, Qin Sang then discovered that although the danger of this step was eliminated, refining the Near Dragon Saliva was not a task that could be accomplished overnight. Refinement and absorption were a lengthy process.</p><p>Calculating it, he could probably save half the time compared to others, but it would still take decades to completely refine this piece of Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from meditation, a contemplative look on his face.</p><p>The effects of the Near Dragon Saliva were truly extraordinary; his divine sense had noticeably improved.</p><p>"First, subdue the Thousand-Knot Divine Net. Then, while absorbing the Near Dragon Saliva, cultivate the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus,' striving to refine the Demonic Fire Origin as soon as possible…"</p><p>Qin Sang set his plan and proceeded to execute it step by step.</p><p>He shut himself off from the outside world.</p><p>Unknowingly, Qin Sang remained in seclusion for half a year, becoming very proficient in refining the Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>This time was different from usual. Qin Sang summoned both the Celestial Eye Butterfly and the Fat Silkworm. The energy containing the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon's Dao rhythm was unusable for him, a human, but perhaps the spirit insects could utilize it!</p><p>This wasn't a sudden whim; Qin Sang had entertained this idea for a while.</p><p>This was the true essence of a Fifth Transformation spirit insect; it would be too wasteful to let it go to waste!</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had the ability to devour, although it currently only manifested in the Dao of Poison.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly could counteract the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon's divine abilities.</p><p>All things in the world could be mutually generative and mutually destructive, thus creating connections.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang also released the Fire Jade Centipede without much hope.</p><p>He commanded the three spirit insects to surround him.</p><p>Qin Sang skillfully peeled off a trace of Near Dragon Saliva and began refining it, simultaneously dividing a portion of his attention to observe the three spirit insects.</p><p>When that energy emerged, it was expelled from his body by the Buddha's light.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede coiled itself up, indifferent.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm sensed the fluctuation, alertly raising its upper body, its eyes darting around. It stared at Qin Sang for a moment, then lost interest and lay back down.</p><p>“This fellow still only eats poisonous things?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned inwardly.  Only the Celestial Eye Butterfly remained.</p><p>He shared a close connection with the Celestial Eye Butterfly and keenly sensed that when the energy appeared, the Celestial Eye Butterfly showed a keen interest, yet also fear.</p><p>The fear was likely due to its lower realm, a suppression from the Fifth Transformation spirit insect's power. Qin Sang felt something similar, but not as pronounced.</p><p>“There’s hope!”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed and quickly soothed the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Near Dragon Saliva was, after all, an inanimate object. Sensing its master's encouragement, the Celestial Eye Butterfly quickly suppressed its instinctive fear.</p>
