<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1291: The Old Demon Qin</p><p>Secret Radiance Stone was a precious spiritual material used for refining magical treasures. Its extraction was extremely difficult, as even the slightest mishap could cause the ore to lose its potency, rendering it worthless. Only Golden Core cultivators, or at least Foundation Establishment cultivators, could carefully extract it using secret techniques.</p><p>Deep within the mine, in a quiet chamber, a man sat in meditation. He had a goatee and was shorter than the average person, yet he wore a wide black robe. His aura was extremely obscure, as if he didn’t exist at all.</p><p>This man was the Nascent Soul cultivator from the Abyss of Sin, tasked with guarding the mine. His appearance was hideous, with a pockmarked face full of scars, earning him the nickname "Pockmarked Hu" among his peers.</p><p>Pockmarked Hu had once been a dashing figure, but during an exploration of a secret realm in the Abyss, he had encountered an accident and was poisoned by a strange toxin. Though he managed to save his life, the residual poison had seeped into his bones, disfiguring his appearance. After several failed attempts to restore his looks using secret techniques, he had resigned himself to his fate and stopped wasting effort.</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp screech echoed outside the chamber, jolting Pockmarked Hu awake. Panicked shouts followed from above: "It's bad! Enemies are invading! Everyone, be careful!"</p><p>Pockmarked Hu's expression darkened. He had anticipated that the alliance from the two regions would send people to seize these spiritual mines, but he hadn’t expected them to arrive so soon. After years of mining, a large canyon had been carved above the Secret Radiance Stone deposit. The defensive formations around the canyon had already been activated.</p><p>Pockmarked Hu's figure flickered as he appeared in the canyon. He looked up and saw that the defensive formations were shaking violently. The enemy had just begun their assault, yet the defenses were already on the verge of collapse.</p><p>"Four Nascent Souls!"</p><p>Seeing four figures, Pockmarked Hu was startled. Among them, one person stood out conspicuously, impossible to ignore. This person's figure was blurred, surrounded by overwhelming demonic flames that ignored the defensive formations entirely.</p><p>Pockmarked Hu suddenly recalled someone and quickly activated his spiritual vision. When he finally saw the person's face, his expression changed drastically, and he exclaimed in shock, "The Old Demon Qin!"</p><p>Without hesitation, Pockmarked Hu summoned his escape light and fled deep into the mine. The surrounding cultivators, who had been waiting for his orders, were dumbfounded by this sudden turn of events.</p><p>Upon hearing Pockmarked Hu's exclamation, Qin Sang's face darkened. After the battle at Twin Mirror Mountain, the nickname "Old Demon Qin" had spread like wildfire, first among the low-level cultivators of the Abyss of Sin, and now it was known to almost everyone.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Yu joined forces to break through the defensive formations. Ignoring the panicking low-level cultivators, they activated their thunder escape technique, transforming into two streaks of lightning as they pursued Pockmarked Hu.</p><p>Pockmarked Hu, sensing the rapidly approaching auras behind him, was filled with terror. Knowing he had no way to escape, he suddenly stopped and turned to face his pursuers.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Yu didn’t slow down. They split to the left and right, coordinating perfectly as they closed in on Pockmarked Hu. With only early Nascent Soul cultivation, Pockmarked Hu was no match for Qin Sang, let alone both of them.</p><p>To avoid complications, Qin Sang directly summoned the Eighteen Demon Banners, while Jing Yu wielded a thunder trident she had recently acquired, which perfectly complemented her divine abilities.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Demonic flames roared, and thunder raged. Pockmarked Hu's breath hitched as he summoned an ancient black cauldron, suspending it above his head. In the next moment, he was engulfed by the demonic flames and thunder, and soon, all sound from him ceased.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt something was off. Pockmarked Hu had died too easily. When he withdrew the demonic flames, he found nothing but the ancient cauldron floating alone. Pockmarked Hu seemed to have been completely obliterated, reduced to ash.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Yu exchanged a glance and were about to inspect the cauldron when it suddenly exploded!</p><p>At the same time, hundreds of miles away from the mine, deep underground in a narrow, dark chamber, there was a sinister altar. A flash of ghostly light appeared, and a figure materialized from illusion to reality—it was Pockmarked Hu.</p><p>Pockmarked Hu stumbled as he appeared but quickly steadied himself, though his face was pale.</p><p>"Fortunately, I had prepared in advance. I didn’t expect the Old Demon Qin to come personally. Those demonic flames are truly terrifying—the rumors weren’t exaggerated in the slightest. If I had been even a moment slower, I would have been injured. I had planned to use the Profound Miasma Orb hidden in the cauldron to ambush one of them, but such tricks likely wouldn’t work on the Old Demon Qin. It’s better for me to flee now. The others will have to fend for themselves!"</p><p>Pockmarked Hu, still shaken, glanced around and then darted out of the chamber.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang and Jing Yu traced his trail to the dark chamber, but Pockmarked Hu was already gone.</p><p>"These old ghosts are all slippery as eels," Qin Sang said with a sigh.</p><p>Jing Yu chuckled, "Those who aren’t cunning have long since perished. How else could they survive to this day? That Dongyang Bo is even more cautious—he never travels alone and always has other Nascent Souls with him, leaving no openings. What are your plans, Fellow Daoist? My cultivation has been mostly stabilized, and soon I’ll return to my cave to seclude myself and refine the Corpse Flower Blood Amber."</p><p>"If you sense the opportunity for a breakthrough, by all means, return to your mountain and focus on your cultivation. Transcending your tribulation is the priority," Qin Sang said, waving his hand. "Dongyang Bo is no longer a major threat. Unless there’s some extraordinary benefit, it’s unlikely the alliance from the two regions would be swayed by him. I just need to guard against him colluding with external enemies or using others to do his dirty work. If he truly seeks his own destruction, I won’t mind personally sending him on his way."</p><p>Jing Yu nodded, "As long as you’re prepared, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Next, the four of them split up and seized all the spiritual mines in the area. The Abyss of Sin had no time to destroy them, and the process went smoothly. It seemed the Abyss was too preoccupied to care about these places anymore.</p><p>Elder Ji stayed behind to guard the mines, while the other cultivators tasked with taking over the mines were on their way.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other three returned, not empty-handed. The previous output from the mines, which the Abyss of Sin hadn’t had time to transport, was divided among the four of them.</p><p>Having completed their mission, the three of them encountered a small-scale battle on their way back. A dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators, led by two Golden Core cultivators, were engaged in a fierce fight.</p><p>Cang Qing raised her hand, and a black spike the size of a thumb shot from her sleeve, appearing instantly before the face of the Abyss of Sin’s Golden Core cultivator. The man only then noticed the three figures in the air. In his panic, he tried to flee, but it was too late. The spike pierced his forehead, killing him on the spot.</p><p>The alliance cultivators, seeing this, were overjoyed and quickly finished off the others before flying up to pay their respects.</p><p>Upon inquiry, they learned that the two armies had clashed ahead, and a major battle had just broken out. The Abyss of Sin had been well-prepared, while the alliance had been caught off guard and was struggling.</p><p>The three of them immediately set off to reinforce their allies.</p><p>Ahead, the battlefield was ablaze with the sounds of battle and cries of war.</p><p>As they flew, Qin Sang’s gaze swept over the battlefield, assessing the situation. Suddenly, his eyes caught a familiar figure, and a look of surprise flashed across his face.</p>
