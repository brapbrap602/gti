<h1>Chapter 1679: Yin-遁 Charm of the Heart</h1><p>*Thump!*</p><p>The demons tumbled out of the sword formation, crashing to the ground, causing the mountain below to tremble.  Without the Saint King's protection, they dared not withstand the sword formation continuously.</p><p>The incident happened suddenly. So many demon kings appearing at once caused demonic energy to surge into the sky, alarming nearby cultivators. Their gazes shifted from Mount Disu, and an uproar erupted.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The cultivators, bracing for battle, raised various magical treasures, pointing them at the demons. The demons, unyielding and ferocious-looking, glared back, some even revealing their true forms, baring fangs and claws.</p><p>Those brought to the Central Plains by Bai Xiao were all transformed demon kings, possessing formidable strength. Yet, exposed to so many cultivators, they felt apprehensive despite their outwardly fierce demeanor. They sensed the avarice in some of the cultivators' eyes.</p><p>Cultivators occupied the land, while the demon race resided in the East Sea.  For years, there had been a fragile peace, the old blood feud fading with time. But given the chance to hunt each other, neither side would hesitate.</p><p>Then, a white figure descended from the sky, exuding the aura of a late-stage transformed being.  Cultivators with malicious intent quickly lowered their gazes, feeling apprehensive.  Even if they could kill these demon kings, they had to consider whether they could withstand the counterattack of a demon Saint.</p><p>Bai Xiao snorted coldly, surveying the mountains with a defiant posture.  He finally looked towards Mount Disu, his brow furrowed. He wasn't worried about their situation; the Saint King wouldn't have brought them here to die. It seemed the Saint King had arrived with a Buddhist saint, suggesting a prior agreement.</p><p>The Daoist master had failed his tribulation. Yet, the Saint King acted strangely. Had something else happened on the mountain?</p><p>"Follow me!"</p><p>The voice of the Qinghu Saint King echoed, his tone unprecedentedly serious.</p><p>Bai Xiao's heart pounded; he didn't dare hesitate, and beckoned his subordinates to fly away. The cultivators, already less eager after seeing Bai Xiao, heard the near-commanding shout directed at the demon Saint. Sensing a fleeting powerful aura, they suddenly realized something.</p><p>High above, a blue shadow flickered, seemingly ignoring the sword formation.</p><p>"It seems…to be a demon Saint King!"</p><p>A cry of surprise rose.  Someone else pointed towards Mount Disu.</p><p>"Look there!"</p><p>On the summit of Mount Disu, a figure appeared – a monk in kasaya, holding Buddhist beads, clearly an amiable old monk. Those who recognized him cried out.</p><p>"It's a Buddhist saint!"</p><p>"Sage Huiguang!"</p><p>"A Nascent Soul cultivator has appeared! He wasn't missing!"</p><p>"If that's so, why did Master Zilei attempt his tribulation so hastily?"</p><p>"Sage Huiguang and the demon Saint King have both appeared. Where is Master Danyu?"</p><p>…</p><p>Regardless of the cultivators' reactions within the Legacy Mansion…</p><p>The demonic spirit, inhabiting its body, repelled Old Devil Fan with a single strike, forcing the Poison King to use a sacred artifact's power to protect himself. The overwhelming demonic intent alarmed Sage Huiguang.</p><p>Only then did Sage Huiguang learn that an ancient demon was sealed beneath Mount Disu, surviving until now. He finally understood why Master Zilei had forcefully attempted his tribulation at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>At this moment, Sage Huiguang's plan to wipe out the Wuxiang Immortal Sect remnants was impossible. Hiding was pointless.  He had to deal with the ancient demon first; everything else had to wait.</p><p>Though Sage Huiguang hadn't experienced that demonic calamity, he knew how terrifying it was. The decline of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and the ruined state of the Southern Barbarian provinces – a testament to its power.  Releasing the ancient demon would have unimaginable consequences!</p><p>Sage Huiguang descended from the heavens.</p><p>Old Devil Fan was fleeing, almost colliding with Sage Huiguang. Upon seeing the arrival, his expression shifted, a complex mix of emotions filling his heart – relief being the most prominent.</p><p>He wondered what changes had occurred in the seal that caused the ancient demon's sudden power surge, allowing it to control the Five Elements Crown.  Although it was just one strike, it had truly frightened Old Devil Fan. His painstakingly cultivated life-saving technique, the Illusion Demon, was destroyed.  Sage Huiguang's timely arrival meant someone could deal with the ancient demon.</p><p>Old Devil Fan worried about how Sage Huiguang intended to deal with him, as he was one of the instigators.</p><p>"Greetings, Saint Monk!"</p><p>Old Devil Fan calmed his breathing, stepping aside to bow.</p><p>Sage Huiguang gazed into the depths of the mountain, ignoring him.</p><p>Fan Laomo didn't dare to show anger. He looked up at the sky.  Below the dissipating tribulation clouds, Hegao Zhenren caught the remains of Zilei Zhenren, concealing the unsightly aftermath of the Heart Demon Tribulation and preserving a last shred of dignity.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren silently gazed at his senior brother, his expression stiff, betraying no obvious sadness.</p><p>However, Fan Laomo could guess his feelings.</p><p>No one expected that Zilei Zhenren, who had successfully passed through three tribulations, would fall to the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>Fan Laomo sighed inwardly, wondering why Dan Yu Zhenjun hadn't appeared.  Remembering that the Eight Scenic View was the root cause of this chaos, he felt somewhat reassured.</p><p>As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work," and besides, he had the Tianhao Tower behind him; the bald-headed monk would have to consider appearances.</p><p>While Fan Laomo was lost in thought, Huiguang Shengzhe's gaze pierced through the chaos, seeing the scene within the mountain.</p><p>The demonic body felt something, and suddenly raised its head.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Their eyes met; both were shaken to their core.</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe was startled by the madness in the demonic body's eyes.  He and Qinghu Shengwang had calculated, when discussing the Heavenly Dao Demon Sound, that one day, if they were assimilated by it, they too would gradually fall into this madness.</p><p>However, the energy within the demonic body was too chaotic, making it difficult for him to see clearly.</p><p>The demonic spirit was frightened by the sudden appearance of the Nascent Soul cultivator and felt threatened.  She had no interest in the Demon-Infected Realm; she only sought to cultivate her spirit. Without the Nascent Soul cultivator, she could have slaughtered the disciples of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, absorbing enough cultivators, finding a place to close herself off, resisting the Heavenly Dao Demon Sound and absorbing the demon child to complete her true nature. A bright future awaited.</p><p>But then, an unexpected event occurred!</p><p>The five-colored pillar of light pursuing Fan Laomo was suddenly retracted by the demonic spirit.  The pillar shot back, like five ropes, wrapping around the giant cocoon and violently pulling the Poison King down.</p><p>“How dare you!”</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe roared.</p><p>Fan Laomo telepathically conveyed the key information.  Huiguang Shengzhe learned that the cocoon contained the Poison King and saw the demonic body's intention.  If the demonic body absorbed the Poison King, they would not only lose a powerful fighter, but the demonic body's strength would inevitably increase.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Five Elements Crown restrained the cocoon, pulling it toward the demonic body.  As it was pulled, the five-colored spiritual light continuously impacted the cocoon, which was visibly pitted and deformed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the demonic body rapidly descended, attempting to retreat into the seal.</p><p>At that moment, a beam of Buddha light emerged from Huiguang Shengzhe's palm—a scroll containing Buddhist mantras, falling from the sky, seemingly slow but actually swift.</p><p>A five-colored pillar of light shot upwards, directly colliding with the mantra scroll.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The mantra scroll, surprisingly fragile, shattered.</p><p>Before the demonic spirit could rejoice, the fragments suddenly erupted with a vast Buddha light, illuminating the entire mountain.  By the time the demonic spirit realized something was wrong, it was too late.</p><p>The mantra scroll wasn't targeting the demonic spirit; its target was the seal!</p><p>Wherever the Buddha light reached, the five-colored seal solidified, as if cast in iron, and a slightly illusory character ‘鎮’ appeared above the seal.</p><p>In a critical moment, Huiguang Shengzhe understood the key point: for some reason, the demonic body's energy was closely connected to the power of the seal, allowing it to hide within the seal and escape.</p><p>To subdue the demonic body, its escape route had to be cut off, ideally isolating it from the seal—to trap it.</p><p>The power of the seal was suppressed by the mantra scroll.</p><p>The demonic body stiffened, feeling a hard barrier beneath it.  It let out a ferocious roar, and the Five Elements Crown shone brightly, its five-colored light plunging downwards.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The mantra scroll shattered.</p><p>However, Huiguang Shengzhe hadn't intended to rely solely on one mantra scroll.  As the scroll broke, eight beams of silver light simultaneously lit up within the mountain.</p><p>The silver lights were like wheels, extremely mystical; they were the Buddha treasures, the Dharma Flower True Wheels.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The Dharma Flower True Wheels simultaneously locked onto the demonic body.  Silver lights appeared around the demonic body, forming silver rings that constricted it tightly.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang finally arrived.</p><p>A yellow light shot into the mountain—an ancient, simple jade, seemingly natural, showing no signs of human craftsmanship.</p><p>Lingyu and Fahua Zhenlun worked together seamlessly.  Instead of attacking the demonic body, a torrent of spiritual water gushed from Lingyu, sounding like crashing waves.  The seemingly gentle stream was sharper than any blade, swiftly severing the connection between the demonic body and its seal.</p><p>But it was only temporary.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>The demonic body raised its head.  Turbulence and determination flickered in its demonic eyes.  Within its body, the demonic spirit, ignoring the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound, directly merged with its true self.</p><p>…</p><p>Simultaneously with the crashing waves came Qinghu Shengwang's furious question.</p><p>"Old monk, what's going on?!"</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe had no time for explanations.  As he appeared, his throat vibrated, emitting a dragon's roar and tiger's growl that echoed through the relic mansion, filled with killing intent.</p><p>"Those who approach Mount Disu, die without mercy!"</p><p>The extent of the ancient demon's previous actions remained unclear, but anyone near it risked demonic corruption.  The spread of this corruption, and the potential for another demonic calamity, had to be stopped.</p><p>The roar echoed like thunder, terrifying everyone.</p><p>At that moment:</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar, focused on observing the Heavenly Tribulation, stood atop the mountain.</p><p>Yue Liting arrived at the foot of Mount Disu, shocked by the failure of Zi Lei Zhenren's tribulation.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao were locked in a fierce battle.  Outnumbered, Mo Xingdao was losing ground, only managing to turn the tide repeatedly through his puppet's incredible escape techniques.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, satisfied with the Lingxi Immortal Fruit, wished to leave the relic mansion.  But unless he abandoned his physical body and used his puppet's Yin-Yang escape technique, escaping Su Zinan would be impossible.</p><p>The sudden appearance of Huiguang Shengzhe sent everyone into a state of alarm.</p><p>By now, they understood the situation.</p><p>The Eight Scenery had allowed the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect to pass through the relic mansion to the Immortal Palace.  Unexpectedly, the path to the Immortal Palace was blocked, and Zi Lei Zhenren's hasty tribulation attempt confirmed earlier rumors.</p><p>Something must have happened in the Immortal Palace, trapping Daoist and Buddhist Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Their attention was focused on each other, completely unprepared for the return of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar rushed into a nearby cave, using every ounce of strength to transmit his thoughts to his main body.</p><p>While Zi Lei Zhenren underwent his tribulation, Qin Sang's main body was diligently breaking the stone chamber's seals. He encountered trouble with the final seal.  Witch clan and human seals differed significantly, slowing the process far behind schedule.</p><p>Fortunately, with the assistance of the Tianmu Butterfly, and the constant shockwaves from the shaking seal, Qin Sang gradually deciphered the pattern.</p><p>He raced against time to break the seal, only to be relieved by Zi Lei Zhenren’s failure, the greatest threat gone.  His relief was short-lived.</p><p>Given the strength of the Daoist and Buddhist sects, if trapped, the best-case scenario would be surrendering all their gains!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Demonic fire instantly engulfed the entire stone door.</p><p>The seal dimmed.  Qin Sang mustered his remaining strength, forcing a crack open and squeezing through.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The stone door slammed shut.</p><p>His aura was temporarily shielded by both the chamber's residual seal and the larger seal, preventing detection.  But he couldn't stay there forever, and could only proceed cautiously.</p><p>Unknown to Qin Sang, Huiguang Shengzhe and Qinghu Shengwang's intervention saved him. Sensing someone's intrusion, the demonic spirit attempted to take him along as it fled.</p><p>On the mountain:</p><p>Others reacted swiftly.</p><p>Yue Liting turned and left.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and Su Zinan stopped fighting.</p><p>Su Zinan coldly watched Mo Xingdao, realizing that reclaiming the Lingxi Immortal Fruit was impossible.</p><p>"Let's see if you can hold onto your treasure!"</p><p>Su Zinan sneered, a yellow talisman appearing in his palm.</p><p>Years ago, when Lu Lao Mo ascended to Nascent Soul, he was invited to the Central Plains.</p><p>The Daoist and Buddhist sects, offering various conditions, including a Daoist marker and the right to enter the Immortal Palace, made a pact with Lu Lao Mo, forbidding him from intervening in this world.</p><p>Lu Lao Mo was relatively kind to Su Zinan, his adopted son, adding a clause to the agreement to spare Su Zinan’s life, no matter what he did.</p><p>Su Zinan knew that the exposure of the demon banner's soul-collecting abilities meant Huiguang Shengzhe couldn't kill him due to his adopted father's legacy, but other methods remained.</p><p>At the very least, the Three Corpse Death God Banner was lost, all his efforts reduced to ashes.</p><p>This talisman, left by his adopted father, was called the Heart-Form Shadow Escape Talisman.  Used correctly, it could mask one's presence from Nascent Soul cultivators.  It was the only one of its kind. Although pained to use it, Su Zinan had no choice.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The talisman shattered.</p><p>Su Zinan’s figure blurred and vanished, his presence erased.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, aware of the danger, recalled his puppet and prepared to flee.</p><p>Suddenly, a monk's ethereal figure blocked his path, hands clasped.</p><p>"Layman, please stay."</p><p>At the same time:</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar, Yue Liting, and even Hegao Zhenren were stopped by the monk.</p><p>His tone was calm but possessed an undeniable authority.</p><p>Yue Liting seethed inwardly.</p><p>Qin Sang, expecting this, made no resistance, simply nodded and slowly retreated from the cave.</p><p>Mo Xingdao reacted swiftly, allowing only his puppet to escape, thankfully carrying the Lingxi Immortal Fruit.  Abandoning his physical body was a difficult decision.</p><p>In reality, he had no chance of escaping with his Yuan Ying; Qinghu Shengwang's intent had locked onto him.</p><p>"Your puppet is quite skillful, but it's best if you cooperate,"</p><p>Her alluring laughter carried a chilling coldness that sent shivers down Mo Xingdao's spine.</p><p>Simultaneously, Huiguang Shengzhe's voice echoed in everyone's ears.</p><p>"Help me subdue the ancient demon, and your past transgressions will be forgiven."</p>
