<h1>Chapter 1790: Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>A golden light, like a bursting river dam, surged forth with an unstoppable force.</p><p>It was clear the golden light was connected to the demon lords.  They had pursued relentlessly, and were not far from the epicenter of the golden light's eruption. When they noticed the anomaly, the auspicious clouds ahead were already turning a pale gold, the color rapidly spreading.</p><p>Qin Sang, bathed in the golden light, felt no discomfort.</p><p>To everyone's spiritual senses, the golden light didn't exhibit much destructive power, only immense spectacle.</p><p>But they soon realized the problem. Illusions affected by the golden light, particularly those formed from the divine abilities of ancient powerhouses, showed signs of instability.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Intense blue light erupted from the edge of the golden light.</p><p>This was the blue sea of light that Youhuang Zhenren had mentioned. For some reason, it was churning up waves of blue light, pushing back the golden light.  Blue and gold intermingled, creating another spectacular sight.</p><p>After countless years of change, these illusions had become mutually restrictive and layered upon each other. The auspicious clouds acted as a buffer and connection, forming a stable structure. Even powerful Nascent Soul cultivators could only navigate the complex illusions, reacting as needed.</p><p>Even with their full power, they could hardly shake these illusions.  As in the rain of soldiers conjured earlier, Qin Sang and the others could only continuously slay the clay figures, unable to find the root cause, let alone break the divine ability.</p><p>Now, the golden light seemed to be shaking the very foundation of this space.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Blinding orbs of light continuously erupted ahead, like the most dazzling fireworks in the world.  These multicolored orbs, carrying strange energy fluctuations – some soft, some forceful, some violently fiery, some gently warm – impacted the surroundings, causing even greater chaos.</p><p>The chaos spread outwards at an alarming rate, reaching them in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Everyone cried out, echoing Zhang Zhenren's alarm.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren stood on a stone platform, all four of them on a cloud path. The path was narrow, barely allowing space for four to cast spells. The stone platform was to their left; two illusions pressed close on their right.</p><p>One was a mass of reddish-yellow threads, as fine as faint clouds; one might mistake them for auspicious clouds without close inspection.  Next to the threads was a fissure, like a monstrous beast hidden in a spatial crack, only its gaping maw visible, constantly devouring the threads.  The devouring never ceased, and the threads were endless.</p><p>Similar illusions existed before and behind the stone platform. Some were clearly divine abilities, others of unknown origin. Should these erupt, with them in the middle, the consequences were unimaginable.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Guyun Zhenren shouted.</p><p>The four took flight, retreating swiftly.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren hastily stopped their work on the stone platform; they couldn't finish setting up the array before the golden light arrived. It wasn't the time for that; both were adept at making the right choices, abandoning the array without hesitation and dashing away from the platform.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as they moved, the stone platform violently shook, and a sudden change occurred.  Lines, dense and deeply etched, suddenly appeared on the previously smooth surface, like an extremely complex talismanic chart.</p><p>Everyone present were versed in talismans. As they retreated, the talismanic chart on the platform entered their vision, triggering their innate talismanic instincts, only to cause a splitting headache.</p><p>The stone platform gave them no time to study it. The moment the chart appeared, a powerful surge erupted from the platform.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren were caught off guard, unable to fully escape. They could only hastily activate their protective treasures, causing a loud bang as a tremendous force slammed into them from below.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang and the others watched in shock as the two zhenren were swept away by the surge from the stone platform. They could only barely protect themselves, powerless against the force.  The distance between them and the two zhenren rapidly increased as they disappeared into the golden light, too quickly to leave a word.</p><p>The stone platform continued to erupt with power, causing immediate chaos. The energy blasted into the cloud-like threads, creating a large indentation, immediately provoking a counterattack. Threads shot out in all directions. Anyone nearby would instantly have several transparent holes in their bodies.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded repeatedly. The golden light triggered a chain of changes, spreading too quickly for Qin Sang and the others to escape.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang felt a blow to his chest, struck by the aftershock of the stone platform's talismanic chart, and was sent flying backward.</p><p>He had already activated the Golden Light Armor, so he wasn't injured.  But as he retreated, Qin Sang saw changes happening on both sides of him, and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly gave a warning.</p><p>The illusions on both sides were expanding; a collision would have unpredictable consequences.  Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  He made a swift decision and crashed into the illusion on his right.</p><p>He'd just entered the illusion, hadn't even seen what was inside, when a piercing wind sound startled him.  He felt an immediate warning, and struck out with a palm towards the rear right.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang turned, but neither he nor the Sky-Eyed Butterfly saw anything. Only a gentle force on his palm pushed him uncontrollably upwards, out into the open.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang was ejected from the illusion, and found himself in a new location, unable to see Youhuang Zhenren and the others.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang could only focus on his own safety; he couldn't worry about them, as they surely had their own protective measures.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>He heard the sound of water above him.</p><p>Without looking up, Qin Sang dashed forward.  The chaos around him was complete—up, down, left, right, everywhere. He felt like he was inside a vibrant, swirling canvas.</p><p>Finding a safe haven in the chaos was impossible. He could only continuously move and dodge, testing his reflexes and strength.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly helped Qin Sang find his way; he only needed to concentrate on avoiding danger.  The improved Sky-Eye ability proved invaluable, allowing him to detect even the briefest openings.</p><p>Working together seamlessly, Qin Sang, aided by the butterfly, weaved through the strange phenomena, sometimes summoning the Lotus Seal, sometimes flapping his Phoenix wings, sometimes using his Spiritwood body to charge forward—a dance on the edge of a knife, enough to make anyone watching wince.</p><p>His situation seemed perilous.</p><p>However, as time passed, Qin Sang discovered the chaos caused by the golden light wasn't as severe as he'd imagined.  The space remained relatively stable and far from collapse.  The ancient divine power wasn't truly activated; it was merely the aftershocks triggered by the golden light that continued to rage.  As long as a Nascent Soul cultivator reacted appropriately, there was no danger to their life, at most just some hardship.</p><p>Relieved, Qin Sang tried to find the others, but they had vanished.  The situation had been too chaotic, and he couldn't remember the location of the stone platform. He remembered the communication talismans they'd prepared before entering, and took one out, activating it.</p><p>The talisman transformed into a sigil in his palm, its light flickering before slowly dissipating.  Qin Sang frowned; the talisman was ineffective here.</p><p>The change had been too sudden; they hadn't had time to decide on a meeting point.  Where should he go now? Should he search for the Demon Lord alone, or leave and wait for them at the Golden Palace?</p><p>Another worry gnawed at him: how long would this unstable situation last? Would there be another, more powerful surge of golden light?</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang noticed a flashing blue light ahead, and a thought struck him – the blue sea of light.</p><p>On the way in, Youhuang Zhenren had described her experiences there, and Qin Sang had listened carefully, committing it to memory. Youhuang Zhenren had explored most of the illusions along her route, knowing where was dangerous and where was relatively safe. If he could find that route, any subsequent changes wouldn’t catch him off guard.</p><p>From the appearance of things, he was already near the blue sea of light.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang immediately sent a mental message to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, instructing it to find a path toward the blue sea of light.</p><p>Like a skilled navigator braving stormy seas, Qin Sang arrived at the edge of the blue sea of light without serious incident.  Before him lay a breathtaking vista of azure.</p><p>According to Youhuang Zhenren, the blue sea of light had been calm, like a pure blue wall of light. Gazing upon it had induced a sense of unprecedented tranquility. This was initially a good thing, but Youhuang Zhenren discovered that after staring at it for some time, the blue sea would ripple outwards in concentric circles, seeming to draw her in and filling her with inexplicable dread, forcing her to stop looking.</p><p>The blue sea of light now showed slight distortions, but remained largely calm.</p><p>Qin Sang avoided looking directly at it and moved along the edge, searching for illusions matching Youhuang Zhenren's description.  Several times, he tried to contact his companions using talismans, but received no reply.</p><p>As he flew,</p><p>a fierce wind approached, bringing with it a vast, overwhelming shadow of black sand.  The black sand exuded an aura of decay.  Qin Sang frowned slightly, unwilling to let such a strange thing touch him, and immediately changed course, moving sideways.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Black sand swept across, clearing a path. Qin Sang darted back, about to make a dash, when a black streak shot from the edge of the passage ahead.</p><p>Before the streak arrived, the Sky-Eye Butterfly had already transmitted the image within: a person!</p><p>The newcomer was a lean young man in black armor.  The armor plates were as fine as fish scales, densely covering his entire body except his head and hands and feet, seeming to be part of his skin.</p><p>Seeing the long, scaled, pointed tail behind him, Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  The newcomer was a demon!</p><p>Here, no one could mask their aura.  When the Sky-Eye Butterfly detected the other party, the other party also sensed Qin Sang.</p><p>The figure rushed into the passage, then suddenly stopped, revealing the young man in black armor.</p><p>This demon had sharp, sunken cheeks and small but extremely sharp eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. He had sensed the other's aura: Transformation Stage Mid-level!</p><p>Comparable to Zhang Zhenren!</p><p>Against a Transformation Stage early-level demon lord, Qin Sang believed he had a good chance of killing it, completing the mission, and withdrawing from the Jushan ritual grounds.</p><p>Facing a mid-level Transformation Stage demon, even with a Stabilizing Truth Pill, Qin Sang didn't have much confidence.</p><p>Repelling and killing were two different things. If he couldn't eliminate the opponent, he'd have no credit, only a pointless battle.</p><p>A mutually injurious battle would be even worse.</p><p>The young man in black armor stared at Qin Sang, a cruel smile playing on his lips. "Were you the one following this Lord just now?"</p><p>These demon lords clearly had backup.  Qin Sang and the others were discovered by them after entering the Nine-Curve Star River.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the black armor on his chest, recalling information he’d read.  This demon should be Li Hou, one of the demon lords of Guifang.</p><p>Compared to other demon lords with illustrious achievements, Li Hou was less renowned, but this was because he rarely appeared on the battlefield.  No one dared underestimate a mid-level Transformation Stage demon.</p><p>Li Hou's eyes flashed with cold light, clearly showing that he saw Qin Sang's lower cultivation and had murderous intent.</p><p>Qin Sang thought quickly, not answering. Wings appeared on his back. He flapped them, turning into a streak of lightning and fleeing to the side.</p><p>As he fled, Qin Sang silently activated the Celestial Demon Transformation, releasing his pure demonic energy, and added, "Lord Li, there's been a misunderstanding."</p><p>Sensing the unusually pure demonic energy, Li Hou paused, then sneered, his face full of killing intent.</p><p>In this realm, the Daoist sects had developed many methods to disguise demonic energy to counter Guifang, though none as pure as this. Li Hou had seen many such techniques and wouldn't be fooled, but his interest in Qin Sang grew even greater.</p><p>Moreover, even if this person was a demon cultivator, he didn't match any demon lord he knew.  His presence here meant he was undoubtedly an enemy.</p><p>Li Hou flicked his pointed tail. A black light erupted from the tip, enveloping him, and he pursued Qin Sang relentlessly.</p><p>One man, one demon, one chasing the other. Li Hou pursued relentlessly.</p><p>The chaos hadn't subsided; their pursuit inevitably involved dodging dangers, slowing their speed.</p><p>Li Hou followed Qin Sang closely, wearing him down while waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, his brow furrowed.</p><p>It seemed Li Hou was also flung out by the golden light.  Oddly, the demon showed no injuries; he wondered what they had gone through.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang tried repeatedly to contact his allies using talismans, but received no response.</p><p>Li Hou watched with a sneer. He had already determined that before the golden light dissipated, any communication would be impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He wasn't afraid, but he didn't want a pointless battle.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He suddenly remembered what Youhuang Zhenren had said about that illusory forest.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren had gathered spirit flowers there, and consuming them had real medicinal effects.</p><p>Perhaps the forest itself was real.</p><p>With abundant wood spirit energy, he could gain a geographical advantage, fight Li Hou using his spirit wood body, and then decide based on the situation.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang immediately formed a plan. His speed unchanged, he continued flying along the edge of the blue light sea.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Li Hou finally found an opening.</p><p>A claw swiped towards Qin Sang's head.  But Qin Sang seemed prepared.  His figure flickered, perfectly using the illusory scenery to deflect the blow.</p><p>Li Hou frowned. This person's escape techniques and spiritual perception were not weak, and he was solely focused on escape.  A swift victory would be impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang continuously outmaneuvered Li Hou, appearing battered but secretly searching for the path.  His efforts paid off; he finally found the illusory scenery Youhuang Zhenren had mentioned.</p><p>Qin Sang’s demeanor didn't change.  Subtly, he altered his escape route.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang followed the path Youhuang Zhenren had taken.  Before long, he found his target!</p>
