<h1>First Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy-Ninth Chapter Tianyue Senior</h1><p>"A traitor from the Profound Heaven Palace, I wonder what this person actually did..."</p><p>The black-clad martial artist turned to look at Master Feng, "Fellow Daoist Feng has extensive connections and is well-informed. Have you received any news?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Master Feng shook his head, "A nascent soul betraying the Profound Heaven Palace, causing such a scandal, how could the Profound Heaven Palace publicize it widely? Moreover, there's the boundless sea in between. Even if rumors spread, who knows when they'll arrive, and what distorted form they'll take."</p><p>The white-robed scholar echoed, "Fellow Daoist Feng speaks reasonably! What this person did isn't important, what matters is what secrets he holds. According to the demon rat, the experts from the Profound Heaven Palace chased him into the demon realm relentlessly, and it's said that they almost alarmed the Great Sage Heavenly Roc, before reluctantly calling off their pursuit. The traitor may have brought out a supreme treasure from the Profound Heaven Palace, but the demon rat didn't specify what it was, perhaps because he didn't know the truth, or perhaps he was concealing something."</p><p>The phoenix-crowned female cultivator raised an eyebrow, radiating charm, "Something regarded as a supreme treasure by the Profound Heaven Palace..."</p><p>The black-veiled martial artist then looked at Master Feng, "The demon rat has already been killed, but the opponent still has more people than us, should we invite reinforcements?"</p><p>Master Feng pondered for a moment.</p><p>"Not long ago, we contacted fellow daoists from the Star Sand Archipelago. The demon race seems aggressive, but there are no substantial actions. It seems Bifang doesn't want to start a war either, and is bluffing to conceal his true purpose. We don't need to make a big fuss, inviting too many people, lest the news leak and cause more trouble."</p><p>After a pause, Master Feng added, "I have ordered people to spread the news, inviting that mysterious fellow daoist, let's wait and see."</p><p>The white-robed scholar asked curiously, "Is this person from the Star Sand Archipelago? Nascent Soul middle stage, proficient in Lightning Escape Technique, it's impossible for him to be unknown!"</p><p>Master Feng shook his head, "I've already asked, no such person exists!"</p><p>Just then, a stream of light flew into the hall.</p><p>Master Feng caught the stream of light, and after reading it, smiled, "Speak of the devil! I'll go back and meet him first, you continue investigating."</p><p>...</p><p>Mount Fengyang.</p><p>Qin Sang was sitting cross-legged in the quiet chamber, when he suddenly felt something and opened his eyes.</p><p>Then, the restrictions of the quiet chamber were triggered.</p><p>Chu Huanqiang's report came from outside, "Senior Mingyue, Master has returned to the mountain and is waiting for you in the main hall."</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the quiet chamber and followed Chu Huanqiang to the top of the mountain, where he saw Master Feng.</p><p>Being old monsters, they exchanged warm greetings, Qin Sang thanked Master Feng for helping him scare away Bifang, and Master Feng expressed shared hatred, quickly becoming familiar like old friends for many years.</p><p>"Forgive Feng for being presumptuous, may I ask where Fellow Daoist Mingyue's Immortal homeland is?"</p><p>Master Feng didn't beat around the bush and went straight to the point, asking about Qin Sang's origin, "With fellow daoist's cultivation and divine abilities, you are a rare existence in the entire Northern Sea. Feng is ignorant, but I have never heard of you."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, and decided to tell the truth, saying calmly, "This poor Daoist is from an outer domain."</p><p>If he was only in the early stage of the Nascent Soul, he could say that he cultivated hard somewhere, and was fortunate to break through, so he was unknown, which would be understandable.</p><p>A cultivator who only cultivates in seclusion cannot have a Nascent Soul middle stage cultivation.</p><p>If Master Feng intends to investigate, but finds that he can't find any news about himself in the cultivation world, he will definitely become suspicious, and the lie will not last long.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang is not afraid of exposing his origin, it is unimportant.</p><p>"Outer domain?"</p><p>Master Feng was stunned, pondered for a moment, and suddenly remembered something, exclaiming, "Fellow Daoist is from Beichen Domain?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, "Fellow Daoist Feng is indeed knowledgeable and remembers everything at first guess, could there be other fellow daoists from Beichen Domain, who crossed the storm and came here?"</p><p>Beichen Domain cultivators know about the Three Realms of the Northern Sea.</p><p>This shows that there must have been communication between the two domains before.</p><p>There must also be legends of Beichen Domain in the Three Realms of the Northern Sea.</p><p>It's normal for Master Feng to know Beichen Domain.</p><p>Qin Sang asked indirectly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Master Feng shook his head repeatedly, "Legend has it that thousands of years ago, the number one expert in Beichen Domain, Tianyue Senior, crossed the sea alone, and defeated all the experts in the Northern Sea with one man and one sword, warning the Northern Sea Three Realms cultivators not to step into Beichen Domain, and the two domains have since lost contact. Fellow Daoist Mingyue is the first cultivator from Beichen Domain that Feng has ever met!"</p><p>Saying this, Master Feng looked surprised, and looked at Qin Sang, as if looking at something rare.</p><p>His expression didn't seem like a disguise.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, it seems that Chen Yan and the others haven't shown their faces in Mount Fengyang, maybe they deliberately concealed their whereabouts.</p><p>Tianyue Sanren. </p><p>Qin Sang's mind turned, and he remembered this person's origin.</p><p>This person was the last Great Cultivator in Beichen Domain before Old Devil Ye!</p><p>It is said that Tianyue Senior was a loose cultivator , who was very low-key throughout his life, had no descendants, and suddenly disappeared, so there are few rumors. Qin Sang only knew about this person when he heard other Nascent Souls talk about it.</p><p>"One man and one sword, defeating all the masters in the Northern Sea..."</p><p>Qin Sang yearned leisurely.</p><p>He never expected that Tianyue Senior, who was only remembered by a few people in Beichen Domain, would leave a great reputation in a foreign land.</p><p>When Master Feng mentioned Tianyue Senior just now, his expression was solemn, obviously very respectful of Tianyue Senior.</p><p>"No wonder there are so many masters in the Northern Sea, but only Master Chen Yan has been to Beichen Domain, it turns out that someone is silently guarding it."</p><p>Qin Sang felt respect in his heart.</p><p>Unfortunately, he knew too little about the deeds of Tianyue Senior.</p><p>It is said that this person was born in the desert, was a genius, had a detached temperament, like idle clouds and wild cranes, traveling everywhere, unrestrained.</p><p>Tianyue Senior's achievement as a Great Cultivator was never publicized, and he accidentally met other fellow daoists once, which was known to people and spread, but then he disappeared again.</p><p>There are different opinions on the whereabouts of Tianyue Senior.</p><p>Some say that Tianyue Senior fell in a secret realm.</p><p>Many ancient secret realms in Beichen Domain are full of dangers, and Great Cultivators dare not be negligent.</p><p>Others say that Tianyue Senior may have silently broken through the Spirit Transformation stage, crossed the storm belt, and traveled around.</p><p>With his temperament, it is very possible.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his thoughts, and was a little curious.</p><p>It's been so long, if Tianyue Senior failed to advance to Spirit Transformation, he must have fallen, apart from Master Chen Yan, wouldn't anyone else want to go and see?</p><p>He only heard Master Feng say, "Back then, Senior Tianyue erected his sword at the Cape of Heaven, and drifted away, and since then no one dared to take half a step, including the Profound Heaven Palace. Later, the demon race grew stronger and stronger, swallowing most of the Star Sand Archipelago, and the Cape of Heaven was also occupied by the demon race. Losing the Cape of Heaven route, even if we want to go to the Beichen Domain, we don't have the strength. Feng once moved this thought, but tried it once, encountered extremely chaotic storm turbulence, almost lost his way, and had to return home. The descendants are unworthy, and I don't know, is the sword erected by Senior Tianyue still there..."</p><p>Master Feng smiled bitterly.</p><p>The Cape of Heaven, in the northern part of the Star Sea Archipelago, is a corner of the barrier protruding towards the storm belt.</p><p>It is said that there is a safe path here that can reach the Beichen Domain, but only relatively speaking, it is not absolutely safe, and the requirements for the cultivation of those who break in are also extremely high.</p>
