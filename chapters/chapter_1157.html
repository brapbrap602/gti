<h1>Chapter 1149: Mountain Guardian Beast</h1><p>Having obtained the treasure, Qin Sang had no desire to continue engaging with the puppet king.  </p><p>Finding a safe place to refine the remaining Azure Luan power within his body was the priority.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang was very worried about Tianmu Butterfly and needed careful observation before making a judgment.  Absorbing tribulation thunder was unheard of, and he didn't want it to negatively impact Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>After flying over several mountain ranges, Qin Sang suddenly changed direction and plummeted.</p><p>"Gak!"</p><p>A panicked shriek echoed from the abyss, as a figure fled in a hurry, only to be seized by Qin Sang by the scruff of its neck.</p><p>It was the Falcon demon!</p><p>The Falcon demon was startled, attempting to struggle, but Qin Sang slapped it on the head.</p><p>Before his breakthrough, Qin Sang could easily capture the Falcon demon without effort; now it was even easier.</p><p>"Behave! You little guy is quite bold, daring to follow me!"</p><p>Qin Sang taunted.</p><p>He had let the Falcon demon go, intending to find him later, but the fellow hadn't fled, instead secretly following to observe Tianmu Butterfly's tribulation.</p><p>The Falcon demon's concealment and disguise skills were good, but trying to hide from Tianmu Butterfly's perception was too naive.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed the Falcon demon sneaking around.  With his increased strength, he simply captured the Falcon demon and took him along.</p><p>The Falcon demon became compliant, dejected, cursing his bad luck.</p><p>Using the treasure left by its mother, the Falcon demon had been running rampant, causing numerous incidents, even lurking in the Wan Snake Abyss for years without being caught.</p><p>However, after failing twice at Qin Sang's hands, the Falcon demon realized that Qin Sang must possess extremely skillful methods capable of easily seeing through its disguise, finally giving in.</p><p>"Big Brother, I'm wrong! Please show mercy and spare this little bird's life! I will never forget your kindness. I was worried when you were being chased by the puppet king and wanted to see if I could help…"</p><p>The Falcon demon repeatedly begged for mercy, trying to appease Qin Sang.</p><p>"Heh, you were hoping to pick up the scraps, weren't you?"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>This kid, whatever he'd been through, was mid-stage demon core, yet so slick and smooth, lacking any of a great demon's bearing.</p><p>The Falcon demon was speechless.  Carried by Qin Sang, it sensed the alluring aura from Qin Sang's body, its eyes darting around.</p><p>The tribulation clouds dissipated, and the stars and moon reappeared.</p><p>In the starry night, two streaks of light chased each other through the air, Yao Fei and the others having been left far behind.</p><p>The puppet king desperately pursued, but the thief's escape technique was even more skillful, the distance growing further until he had to give up. He watched helplessly as the thief sped away, taking the mysterious stone tablet and the Four-Change Spirit Insect.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The puppet king angrily smashed a large rock, venting his fury.</p><p>Flying far away, ensuring the puppet king was shaken off, Qin Sang found an uninhabited mountain, entered it, and casually created a cave dwelling.</p><p>Bai stood guard outside.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the Falcon demon aside, about to resume cultivating and refining the Azure Luan power.</p><p>The Falcon demon, after much hesitation, couldn't resist the temptation, shamelessly pleading: "Master! Grandpa! You clearly have a kind heart.  You successfully found that stone tablet in the demon nest; I deserve some credit for that. Please, let me take just one breath!"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes. "One breath of what?"</p><p>The Falcon demon eagerly replied, "The mysterious aura sealed within the stone tablet. I can feel it'll greatly benefit me, which is why I lurked in the Wan Snake Abyss for so long.  After absorbing it, I might advance to the late stage."</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Falcon demon, curiously asking, "You were also drawn to the stone tablet and infiltrated the demon king's treasure vault? You're a Thunder Swallowing Falcon, without Azure Luan bloodline; wouldn't recklessly merging Azure Luan essence blood damage your foundation?"</p><p>"Azure Luan essence blood?"</p><p>The Falcon demon froze, shaking its head repeatedly. "I wouldn't dare to directly absorb the essence blood, but the power within it also contains a strange thunder force.  It's extremely unique, and might improve my aptitude."</p><p>So it coveted the thunder power contained within the Azure Luan essence blood.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>Thunder Swallowing Falcons are born with thunder control abilities; its perception should be accurate.  It seemed Tianmu Butterfly's ability to absorb heavenly thunder was related to the unique thunder power in the Azure Luan's true blood, but its origin remained unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fully integrate the Azure Bird's blood, so he channeled it into his wings, continuing to refine them for the potential to develop lightning-based abilities.  This refinement, primarily using the Azure Bird's blood, would dissipate much of the lightning power. Sharing some with the hawk demon wouldn't be a significant loss for him.</p><p>"This lightning power isn't very useful to me," Qin Sang said calmly. "But I know you resent me. Why would I give this to you, cultivate a powerful enemy for myself?"</p><p>The hawk demon chuckled nervously. "I've already submitted, I wouldn't dare oppose you. I swear on my demonic soul!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, unconvinced. "I only trust my own."</p><p>The hawk demon nervously laughed. "Your own... you wouldn't be thinking…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He needed a mount, one that would willingly submit.  The white crane was intelligent, but also incredibly lecherous, likely to cause trouble.  Qin Sang had taken the crane only for temporary use. Its potential was far inferior to the Thunder Hawk.  The Thunder Hawk, a descendant of a transformed demon, had immense potential after absorbing the Azure Bird's lightning power.</p><p>"No way! Absolutely not!"</p><p>The hawk demon was furious, feeling insulted. It wasn't a mindless beast; it wouldn't willingly become anyone's mount.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.  Getting a spirit beast to willingly submit was difficult. He ignored the hawk demon, closing his eyes and continuing to refine the Azure Bird's power.</p><p>The hawk demon was dumbfounded. Shouldn't he continue negotiating?  He was desperate, coveting the Azure Bird's power, finally blurting out, "Within a hundred years, I'll come to your cave and be your guardian beast. How about that?"</p><p>"Your life is in my hands right now," Qin Sang said indifferently.  "Disobedience means plucking your feathers and making soup.  Why the extra step?"</p><p>The hawk demon stiffened, then suddenly grew defiant. "If you dare touch a single feather, my mother won't let you live! She's also a transformed demon, skilled in lightning techniques.  You might have escaped the Weaving Machine Demon King, but against my mother, you'll be dead!"</p><p>Qin Sang mocked him, "For a descendant of a transformed demon, you're surprisingly weak. I wonder who your esteemed father is."</p><p>"My mother lives peacefully in the Boundless Valley, she's not some Demon King,"  the hawk demon retorted. "She’s already placed a hidden mark on me. I know you don't believe me, but go ahead, try it.  I move freely in demon king lairs, I have my means of protection!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. From the Boundless Valley... it must be that fat chicken. The hawk demon wasn't lying; he truly had a transformed Thunder Hawk mother. Qin Sang had witnessed the Thunder Hawk's power firsthand—a single combat against two Yuan Ying cultivators without losing ground. Even after his own Yuan Ying advancement, he wasn't confident in defeating it.</p>
