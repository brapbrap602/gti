<h1>Chapter 1382: Ice Sacrifice</h1><p>Wa Yu opened its mouth, wanting to say something more.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>The restriction on the cave dwelling opened, and a rat demon pushed the door out.</p><p>The rat demon's appearance was similar to that of ordinary rats, but the difference in size was too great.</p><p>This rat demon was comparable to a calf in size, with thick limbs, and its fur was a neon color, as if light was constantly flowing.</p><p>Rainbow Rat  was named for this.</p><p>The rat demon's eyes darted around, with an unconcealable weakness and fatigue.</p><p>Bifang and the other demons looked towards the cave dwelling in unison, and when they saw the rat demon, they all showed joy.</p><p>However, after seeing the state of the rat demon.</p><p>The two male and female Demon Kings' expressions darkened slightly. They exchanged glances, their figures flashed, and they appeared on both sides of the rat demon, like two bodyguards, faintly guarding against the other three demons.</p><p>The Cunning Fox  smiled charmingly, extremely alluring.</p><p>A displeased look flashed in Wa Yu's eyes.</p><p>Bifang seemed not to see it, his expression unchanged, looking at the rat demon, he asked with concern: "Rainbow Fellow Daoist ! How are your injuries?"</p><p>"One day, I will definitely repay this debt! Cough cough..."</p><p>The rat demon looked in the direction of the Crescent Moon Realm , hatred welling up in its eyes.</p><p>Its voice was like that of a wizened old man, with a look of insufficient energy.</p><p>After coughing a few times, the rat demon's hatred subsided, and it turned its head to look at Bifang, and said in a low voice, "Fellow Daoist, don't worry, this King won't die for the time being! However, I need to recuperate for a while before I can complete the Divine Ability  and completely transform the clone into the main body. During this period, I can only appear in demon form, my cultivation level  is greatly restricted, and it is inconvenient to take action. I can only trouble you all."</p><p>Bifang breathed a sigh of relief and asked, "Can Fellow Daoist first find the hiding place of the Profound Heaven Palace  traitor? I'm afraid that person has already escaped from this sea area."</p><p>Unexpectedly, the rat demon gently shook its head and smiled bitterly, "Using that secret technique  consumes a lot of energy. My current state cannot bear it. At least, I need to recuperate for a few days before I can do it..."</p><p>Saying that, seeing that Bifang and the other demons showed disappointment, the rat demon paused, "Fellow Daoists, don't worry, he has been severely injured by me several times, and this time he is exhausted and almost dying. If it hadn't been for the unexpected interference of that Shen , ruining my good deeds, I would have captured this person long ago! Now, he must be hiding to heal his injuries, and he can't run too far. I can vaguely sense that he is still somewhere in the nearby sea area. Once I recover a portion of my cultivation , I will immediately drag him out."</p><p>Bifang and Cunning Fox  exchanged glances, worried, "I'm afraid that Old Ghost Feng  and that Shen  will find him first! They even designed in advance to ambush Fellow Daoist Rainbow , it is very likely that they have already discovered something."</p><p>Rainbow Rat  knew what Bifang was afraid of, and sneered: "My main body was besieged, and feeling that there was no hope of escape, I decisively self-detonated, not letting them succeed."</p><p>At this time, the female Demon King beside Rainbow Rat  interjected, "Fellow Daoist Bifang  doesn't need to worry. The Profound Heaven Palace  traitor is good at concealment techniques, and it is not so easy to be caught. Fellow Daoist Rainbow  personally taking action also requires a lot of effort to confirm that person's hiding place."</p><p>Hearing this, Bifang's expression eased slightly, and he comforted, "Fellow Daoist Rainbow  has suffered! After this matter is over, we will definitely avenge Fellow Daoist!"</p><p>Rainbow Rat  remained noncommittal and turned to return to the cave dwelling.</p><p>The Demon Kings  could only continue to wait.</p><p>...</p><p>Unknown space.</p><p>Darkness shrouded everything.</p><p>In the depths of the darkness, faint blue fluorescent light flickered faintly.</p><p>This seemed to be underground.</p><p>Where the fluorescent light shone, one could see an irregular black stone wall, with protruding rocks and jagged edges. The surface of the stones was covered with a layer of frost.</p><p>The chill emanated from the blue fluorescent light.</p><p>Four ice pillars stood on the ground, arranged in four directions, each as tall as a person, covered with runes. The fluorescent light came from the runes.</p><p>In the middle of the four ice pillars, the chill condensed into a huge block of ice.</p><p>The white ice block floated above the ground. In the middle of the ice block, a person was lying down, sealed in the profound ice , motionless.</p><p>This person was dressed in white, his face pale and bloodless, without any fluctuations, as if he were a corpse.</p><p>Not knowing how long passed.</p><p>A flush appeared on the white-clothed man's face, and suddenly, he seemed a bit more alive. His eyelids trembled slightly, and he actually woke up.</p><p>An imperceptible sigh sounded in the space.</p><p>The white-clothed man looked inside himself. The sight was terrible, and his expression was bitter, "Although the Ice Sacrifice Secret Technique  can recover me, what it overdraws is actually my own foundation. It won't last long, and I'll be even weaker later. If I unseal the Xuanbing , that guy will come looking for me. Before that, I must first solve this major hidden danger ..."</p><p>The fluorescent light flickered.</p><p>The white-clothed man closed his eyes, and his aura became silent again.</p><p>...</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The stone door suddenly shattered.</p><p>Now, only Bifang and the one male and one female Demon Kings  were guarding outside.</p><p>They were startled and stood up abruptly, looking at Rainbow Rat  rushing out of the cave dwelling.</p><p>Rainbow Rat's  eyes were bloodshot, its breathing was rapid, its head was shaking back and forth, and its expression was agitated.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Bifang had a bad premonition in his heart but was still able to remain calm.</p><p>Rainbow Rat  gasped for breath, "The mark is moving abnormally! That person is deciphering my tracking secret technique !"</p><p>Hearing this, the three demons' expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Rainbow Rat  let out a cold snort, "Daring to actively touch the mark, seeking death! This King will fulfill him now! Please, three fellow Daoists, help me!"</p><p>The three demons were surprised and delighted.</p><p>Rainbow Rat  opened its pointed mouth and let out a sharp shriek towards the sky.</p><p>The shriek was extremely sharp, like a demonic sound piercing through the clouds, and could be heard clearly even outside the island.</p><p>The demon soldiers  entrenched in the vicinity were in an uproar when they heard the shriek. Some bird demons  flying in mid-air became stiff and plunged into the sea headfirst.</p><p>Not to mention the chaos outside.</p><p>At the same time as Rainbow Rat  let out the shriek, it spat out a mouthful of essence blood , which floated in mid-air. Bifang and the three demons exchanged glances and simultaneously took action to help Rainbow Rat  stabilize the essence blood .</p><p>Rainbow Rat's  eyes were like lightning.</p><p>Before long, the essence blood  suddenly burst apart.</p><p>A look of fatigue appeared in Rainbow Rat's  eyes, and it whispered, "Go!"</p><p>After saying that, Rainbow Rat's  body size shrunk, turning into the size of an ordinary rat, and leaped up.</p><p>At the same time, spiritual light flickered on the male and female Demon Kings . One transformed into a hawk demon  in the form of a falcon, while the female Demon King  transformed into a green snake, and together with Rainbow Rat , jumped onto the hawk demon's  back.</p><p>Bifang also manifested his demon form .</p><p>One black and one red streaks of light flew out of the demon island  and went straight to the west.</p><p>Not long after they flew out, waves appeared on the sea, and a green line separated the water surface, rushing over. It turned out to be Wa Yu carrying the Cunning Fox .</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>On the nameless island.</p><p>Island Master Shen  was at a loss.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt an abnormality from the blood worm in his palm. His expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly urged his secret technique . Then, he discovered that the blood worm was tense, pointing straight to the west, actually easily determining the location of the Profound Heaven Palace  traitor.</p><p>Island Master Shen  was both surprised and delighted. He immediately rushed out of the main hall, took out the communication treasure to send messages to others, but when it came to Daoist Mingyue , he hesitated for a moment.</p><p>After hesitating for a while.</p><p>Island Master Shen  still decided to call Daoist Mingyue  to go with him, just in case.</p><p>During this period, the demon race  showed no signs of withdrawing their troops, obviously not willing to give up.</p><p>Although the mastermind, Rainbow Rat , had been ambushed and killed by their design, Island Master Shen  did not dare to be certain whether Bifang had other ways to lock onto the Profound Heaven Palace  traitor.</p>
