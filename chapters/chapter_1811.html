<h1>Chapter 1802: Gauntlets and Sword Artifacts</h1><p>Baishi Prefecture.</p><p>Xuyi Prefecture.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu's Residence.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Northern Pole Exorcism Court and went straight to this place. Upon seeing Grandmaster Lingxu, he heard good news.</p><p>"It's only been a few years, and unexpectedly, Fellow Daoist is now one of us. Congratulations! Congratulations!"</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu saw Qin Sang and clicked his tongue in admiration.</p><p>"Thank you, Grandmaster Lingxu, for your help back then. You moved True Person Xingqiong to come out of seclusion, which enabled this humble Daoist to reach this stage today."</p><p>What Qin Sang said was the truth.</p><p>If Beigong Nandou hadn't helped him refine talismans for Stellar Essence Infusion, who knows how much effort it would have taken him to break through, and his tribulation wouldn't have been so smooth either.</p><p>"This is this old Daoist's duty. Why should my dear friend be so polite?"</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu pulled Qin Sang to sit down, his expression cordial, and he couldn't wait to say, "After you left last time, Fellow Daoist, this old Daoist shamelessly wrote to a few old friends asking for Hundred-Section Earth Bamboo, and there is indeed news."</p><p>"Oh? I wonder which Fellow Daoist currently possesses the Hundred-Section Earth Bamboo?"</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly had broken through on its own and didn't need the Azure Frost Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang had been collecting ingredients for so long, and the pill formula was only missing one spiritual herb. Naturally, he didn't want to give up halfway.  Once the Azure Frost Pill was refined, he could leave it for the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>"That old fellow's Daoist name is Guzhen. He comes from the Celestial Physician Division of the Tianshu Institute. His attainments in the Dao of Alchemy far surpass this old man's, but he rarely sets up his cauldron outside the Dao Court, so his fame isn't widespread. Fellow Daoist may not have heard of him."</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu briefly introduced this person.</p><p>"Someone from the Dao Court?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression became slightly serious.</p><p>In this world, the Daoist sects flourished, with the Dao Court reigning supreme.  Whether in terms of strength or various esoteric arts, the Dao Court certainly had no shortage of experts.</p><p>By visiting these people, presumably, all of Qin Sang's problems could be easily solved.</p><p>However, Qin Sang deliberately avoided the Dao Court.  Grandmaster Lingxu and Grandmaster Gu both came from the lineage of ancestral temples and monasteries.</p><p>Although temples and monasteries were closely connected with the Dao Court, after prolonged contact, one could still sense the difference.</p><p>The Dao Court's strict structure and vast influence brought immense pressure, and Qin Sang always avoided it if possible.</p><p>"Is Master Guzhen willing to part with it?" Qin Sang asked, frowning.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu nodded. "The value of Hundred-Section Earth Bamboo lies in its rarity. The Dao Court possesses countless spiritual herbs more precious than Hundred-Section Earth Bamboo. Old Daoist Guzhen is experienced and knowledgeable. Even if we offer better treasures, it would be difficult to move him.  However, Old Daoist Guzhen is somewhat interested in the Azure Frost Pill formula. Without your consent, Fellow Daoist, this old Daoist wouldn't dare to make the decision on my own."</p><p>He had an agreement with Qin Sang that the pill formula couldn't be divulged.</p><p>So that's how it is.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, isn't this selling to multiple parties? One pill formula in exchange for a stalk of Hundred-Section Earth Bamboo and Grandmaster Lingxu refining the pill.</p><p>Whether it's worth it or not depends entirely on oneself.</p><p>As long as the Panhu True Scripture wasn't revealed, selling a few pill formulas shouldn't bother the Ghost Mother.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and said, "Master, please don't reveal this humble Daoist's origins. Just say that the pill formula was obtained by Master by chance."</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu was slightly taken aback, seeing Qin Sang's wariness towards the Dao Court.</p><p>This was normal.  Anyone facing such a behemoth as the Dao Court would have to be cautious, let alone Qin Sang, who came from Jushan Prefecture.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu nodded, then suddenly looked at him with anticipation. "During these years of searching for similar pill formulas, Fellow Daoist, have you made any new discoveries?"</p><p>The old Daoist's expression at this moment was like a child anticipating a new toy. Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh at the allure of pill formulas for alchemists.</p><p>"This humble Daoist thoroughly searched after returning and managed to compile a pill formula, but I don't know if this formula can be successfully refined." Qin Sang took out a jade slip he had prepared beforehand.</p><p>The jade slip recorded a type of pill called the Yinghua Pill.</p><p>The Yinghua Pill was one of the pills recorded in the Panhu True Scripture. Its efficacy was slightly weaker, but it was the easiest to refine. When a spirit insect was at the fifth transformation realm, consuming it could enhance its cultivation to a certain extent.</p><p>However, this effect was secondary. This pill's greatest function was that, in the process of continuous consumption by the spirit insect, it could subtly weaken the barriers between minor realms, laying a solid foundation for future breakthroughs.</p><p>This pill needed to be used in conjunction with the Panhu True Scripture to achieve its maximum efficacy; otherwise, its effects would be greatly reduced.</p><p>Previously, with the help of his avatar, Qin Sang had dabbled in the Dao of Alchemy and achieved some proficiency. If he had the intention to continue studying the Dao of Alchemy, one day, he could also refine the Yinghua Pill himself.</p><p>After weighing the pros and cons, he realized his accumulation in alchemy was far less than in artifact refinement. Qin Sang decided to temporarily abandon the Dao of Alchemy.</p><p>His avatar still existed and could potentially handle it; he truly couldn't divide his attention.</p><p>Re-refining his avatar to possess Soul Formation cultivation would take an unknown amount of time, and insufficient cultivation would hinder achievements.</p><p>To find the path to ascension, he needed to increase his strength as soon as possible. Comprehending the Dao of Alchemy, collecting spiritual herbs, and setting up a cauldron to refine pills would all consume a large amount of time and energy. It was better to entrust it to others.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu was overjoyed. He took the pill formula and eagerly began to examine it.</p><p>"All spiritual flowers. This should be the Nine-Layered Serpent Stamen. Hmm, the spiritual flowers required for this formula are more precious, but fortunately, they aren't particularly rare..."</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu was immersed in the formula, muttering to himself, as if he had forgotten Qin Sang in front of him.</p><p>When he came back to his senses, he discovered a jade box had appeared on the table in front of him. Opening it, he saw a demon core.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu was startled.</p><p>The aura of the demon core indicated that its previous owner was a mid-stage Profound Void demon, and the demon core didn't contain the residual ferocious intent characteristic of savage beasts.</p><p>It was precisely because of this difficult-to-erase ferocity that the value of savage beast demon cores was inferior to that of normal demon beasts.</p><p>The owner of this demon core was a Demon Marquis during its lifetime!</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu looked at Qin Sang with shock in his eyes. "Fellow Daoist, you killed a mid-stage Profound Void Demon Marquis?"</p><p>It was indeed the Li Marquis' demon core.</p><p>"It was pure luck. I encountered a severely injured Demon Marquis," Qin Sang said calmly. "How many of the spiritual herbs in the pill formula can this demon core exchange for?"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu couldn't answer for a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang said decisively, "Could Master help me exchange it for spiritual herbs, all to be used to refine Yinghua Pills? I want as many as possible! If this demon core isn't enough, this humble Daoist will go hunting savage beasts in the Vicious Territory again."</p><p>By cultivating the Panhu True Scripture, while his own cultivation increased, he could help his natal spirit insects grow rapidly, but the bottlenecks between realms still existed. The master could only provide limited assistance to the spirit insects. With sufficient Yinghua Pills to aid them, before the sixth transformation, he wouldn't need to worry about the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang's tone carried great confidence, as if savage beast demon cores were readily available.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu was bewildered.  Was he truly just recently entered the Profound Void realm?</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang, Grandmaster Lingxu thought to himself that he needed to re-evaluate this Fellow Daoist. He was planning to refine this pill personally anyway, so naturally, there was no reason to refuse.</p><p>Qin Sang originally intended to discuss the compensation for pill refinement with Grandmaster Lingxu, as it wouldn't be just one batch. He might need to ask Grandmaster Lingxu for help continuously in the future.</p><p>According to convention, when requesting an alchemist to refine pills, it was implicitly agreed that the pill formula would be offered as a gift.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Grandmaster Lingxu flatly refused.</p><p>The two discussed and reached an agreement. Grandmaster Lingxu decided to visit Master Guzhen in the near future, exchange for the Hundred-Section Earth Bamboo, and set up his cauldron to refine the Azure Frost Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang would wait until the pills were finished before departing, so he asked Grandmaster Lingxu to lend him a fire chamber, which Grandmaster Lingxu readily agreed to.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the fire chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang sat quietly for a long time.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu was no longer in the residence, and a Daoist boy stood guard outside the door. No one disturbed Qin Sang.</p><p>Several items were placed in front of him.</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor.</p><p>The Wood Jiao's scales.</p><p>The Li Marquis' transverse bone awl and a pair of claw gauntlets.</p><p>In addition to these, there were some spiritual materials and savage beast bones found by the Li Marquis from its storage artifacts.</p><p>He was considering how to refine these for his own use.</p><p>The claw gauntlets and bone awl had been refined by the Li Marquis for many years. The auras of the two treasures were similar, and with artifact refinement techniques, there was a chance to meld them together.</p><p>The power of the bone awl alone was comparable to a pseudo-spiritual treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang had the Grey Warbler Sword and the Four-Carriage Serpent Seal, and the Cloud Wanderer Sword was also nearing completion. He decided to refine a pair of gauntlets powered by vital energy and blood. He couldn't just rely on his bare fists in battle.</p><p>Regarding this, he had consulted Grandmaster Gu and already had a general idea.</p><p>Personally refining the gauntlets and consulting Grandmaster Gu, as well as later personally repairing the broken drum, were all aimed at improving his artifact refinement skills.</p><p>The ultimate goal was, firstly, to complete the Cloud Wanderer Sword as quickly as possible, and secondly, to repair the Taiyi Star Carriage early.</p><p>He might still need to rely on this treasure when searching for the path to ascension and the Dao Marker Gate.</p><p>He wore a contemplative expression, sketching the outline of the gauntlets in his mind. His gaze swept over the various treasures before him, and finally, he put away the Returning Wind Armor.</p><p>He had originally intended to integrate the Wood Jiao's scales into the Returning Wind Armor. After some thought, Qin Sang decided to use them all to refine the gauntlets.</p><p>The first step was shaping.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the spiritual fire in the fire chamber, first refining all the spiritual materials to remove impurities.</p><p>He used the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to refine materials that were difficult to temper.</p><p>Gradually, spheres of varying sizes floated within the fire chamber. Some were liquid, and some were pure orbs.</p><p>Only the Wood Jiao scales, the bone awl, and the claw gauntlets remained.</p><p>One by one, the azure scales flew into Qin Sang's palm, gradually shrinking under the tempering of the spiritual fire, their luster becoming even more dazzling.</p><p>Then came the bone awl and the claw gauntlets.</p><p>These three items were melted and fused, forming the structure of the gauntlets. Finally, a pair of initially formed gauntlets appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>The gauntlets were only the size of fists. Their surfaces shimmered with azure light, displaying beautiful fish scale patterns, as if they were formed by layers of fish scales.</p><p>At the knuckles of each gauntlet, three sharp spikes protruded. The spikes were slightly curved, glinting with a cold light, exceptionally sharp, easily capable of piercing an enemy's defenses. They were undeniably vicious weapons!</p><p>Looking at his creation, Qin Sang made some further adjustments and nodded in satisfaction, drawing the orbs into the gauntlets, strengthening their structure and enriching the details.</p><p>The shaping was complete. The next step was to inscribe restrictions and runes, a crucial step that determined the gauntlets' power.</p><p>This step was equivalent to opening meridians for the gauntlets. The restriction runes were like meridians, which artifact refiners referred to as "penetrating energy channels."</p><p>The choice of restriction runes, how to combine them, and whether they were compatible with the user all required careful consideration and extreme caution.</p><p>Refining for himself was relatively simpler, but the progress was still extremely slow.  Several months passed, and he only obtained a rudimentary form.</p><p>During the refining process, Qin Sang gained many insights and also had many thoughts that needed to be clarified. He knew it couldn't be accomplished overnight, so he stopped refining.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu had returned at some point. Seeing Qin Sang emerge from seclusion, he immediately pulled him into the hall and presented a jade bottle, stroking his beard and smiling, "Fortunately, I haven't failed your trust!"</p><p>Three pills were stored within the jade bottle.</p><p>The azure pills had a layer of fine white frost on their surfaces, like wispy white clouds drifting across the blue sky.</p><p>Three Azure Frost Pills!</p><p>Qin Sang was pleasantly surprised and greatly admired Grandmaster Lingxu's skill.</p><p>According to the pill formula, one batch of Azure Frost Pills, if all the spiritual herbs' medicinal properties were of superior quality and other conditions were near perfect, could yield four pills.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the spiritual herbs he collected were of varying quality. Grandmaster Lingxu achieving three pills was a testament to his superb alchemy skills.</p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, thinking to himself that if the Fire Jade Centipede consumed three Azure Frost Pills and still couldn't break through, he could only let nature take its course.</p><p>Gathering the spiritual herbs needed for the Yinghua Pill would still take time, so Qin Sang didn't stay any longer and bid farewell to Grandmaster Lingxu.</p><p>...</p><p>Northern Zhongmao Prefecture.</p><p>Zhengxing Prefecture, Miaotong Altar.</p><p>After leaving Grandmaster Lingxu's residence, Qin Sang arrived at this metropolitan altar.</p><p>He was going to visit a faction called the Dianjin Mountain.</p><p>Dianjin Mountain was quite famous in the Daoist community, specializing in artifact refinement. Their affiliated business, Dianjin Pavilion, had branches in many prefectural altars.</p><p>However, Dianjin Mountain's main headquarters weren't in a prefectural altar but were located under the jurisdiction of a relatively remote metropolitan altar.</p><p>After making inquiries, Qin Sang chose Dianjin Mountain.</p><p>At this time, he had changed his appearance and traveled from the prefectural altar, landing at the metropolitan altar's city gate. He entered the immortal city and found the Dianjin Pavilion.</p><p>Stepping into the pavilion, Qin Sang simply said he wanted to appraise a magical treasure. A servant girl led him to the back hall, where he met an artifact refiner from Dianjin Mountain.</p><p>He saw through the other party's cultivation at a glance.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down casually. "I heard that the Dianjin Mountain Sect Master is a Grandmaster Artifact Refiner. This humble Daoist came here specifically to admire your reputation. I have a treasure that I'd like your Sect Master to take a look at, but I wonder how I can meet him?"</p><p>The other party's expression remained unchanged. "As long as Fellow Daoist's treasure is rare enough, the Sect Master will certainly meet you personally."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a wooden box and placed it on the table. "If Fellow Daoist wants to see it, take it."</p><p>The artifact refiner took it in his hands.  After a short while, beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. He couldn't even break the restrictions on the wooden box and immediately understood.</p><p>He looked at Qin Sang with awe, hurriedly stood up, and respectfully said, "Please wait a moment, True Person. This humble Daoist will go and invite the Sect Master to come down!"</p><p>A servant girl brought fragrant tea.</p><p>Qin Sang waited in the quiet room for the time it took to burn an incense stick. Then, the door was knocked on, and a square-faced Daoist priest walked in.</p><p>The Daoist priest was stern and had a serious demeanor. He entered and bowed respectfully.  "My subordinate was ignorant and怠慢了真人 (disrespected the True Person)."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and returned the greeting with a smile. "It's only because this humble Daoist came uninvited."</p><p>The Daoist priest was the Dianjin Mountain Sect Master.  He sat down opposite Qin Sang, neither asking about Qin Sang's identity nor the origin of the treasure.  After receiving permission, he opened the wooden box.</p><p>The box seemed empty, allowing one to see the wood grain of the bottom directly.</p><p>The Dianjin Mountain Sect Master's gaze narrowed slightly. He cautiously extended both hands, lifting out the Chengying Sword.</p><p>"After obtaining some more artifact refinement manuals from Dianjin Mountain and verifying my previous findings, the refinement of the gauntlets should be foolproof..." Qin Sang sipped his spiritual tea, pondering silently.</p><p>The Dianjin Mountain Sect Master's palms surged with golden light, his hands appearing as if cast from gold and iron. The golden light spread towards the Chengying Sword's blade, illuminating the golden sword body, clearly using a unique secret technique to examine it.</p><p>Then he switched to several other secret techniques in succession.</p><p>A look of confusion flashed in the Dianjin Mountain Sect Master's eyes, and he hesitantly said, "This might not be a sword."</p><p>"Not a sword?"  Qin Sang was surprised, somewhat puzzled.</p><p>The Dianjin Mountain Sect Master nodded. "At least it doesn't belong to any type of sword artifact I've seen before. Perhaps my knowledge is limited. But I suspect it's not a magical treasure or a spiritual treasure at all, nor does it resemble the legendary true treasures. Instead, it's a special kind of treasure.  Perhaps... finding a sword cultivator skilled in the Way of the Sword might be able to discern something."</p>
