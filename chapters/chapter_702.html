<h1>Chapter 694: Thousand Demon Sea</h1><p>“Go now?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards Huntian Island, a hesitant expression on his face.</p><p>Han Cuo said, seeing this, “Friend Daoist, if you have no pressing matters, there’s no need to rush. Once you’re on Huntian Island, getting back out isn’t so easy; you’ll miss a lot. Our human cultivators have set up a sort of market outside Huntian Island, a place for exchange and news. It serves as a base. Those who dare stay outside the island at this time are all quite strong. Sometimes, even strong cultivators face misfortune and have to sell their most treasured possessions.  So, rare and valuable items often appear in the market.  Friend Daoist might want to come along and have a look; you might find something you like.  As you helped us defeat those powerful enemies, let us treat you to show our gratitude…”</p><p>“Oh? It seems Daoist Han has made a significant gain.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Han Cuo.</p><p>He wouldn’t go to Duoyan Island, and certainly wouldn’t go to Huntian Island. He had guessed there would be a market outside Huntian Island, but he didn’t expect Han Cuo to mention it, preparing to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>He wasn’t attracted by the treasures Han Cuo mentioned; Qin Sang planned to find out what he wanted to know at the market, and then directly search for the Wan Shi Chang.</p><p>“To be frank with Daoist Qin, my gains in this period are comparable to almost ten years past.”</p><p>Han Cuo smiled modestly, then sighed, “I originally thought that the mid-Core Formation stage was my limit.  Going forward, perhaps I could see a glimmer of hope for the late stage. With this opportunity, I might as well give it a try, otherwise I wouldn't risk my life and stay outside…”</p><p>Hearing Han Cuo’s words, another Core Formation cultivator also looked moved.</p><p>“In that case, I will go with you all, hoping for a good harvest.”</p><p>Qin Sang considered it for a moment and agreed.</p><p>Han Cuo and the others were overjoyed and immediately decided to set off together.</p><p>Their flight direction was exactly opposite to Huntian Island, clearly heading towards the deeper part of the Demon Sea.</p><p>It was clear that Han Cuo and the others were very cautious. They changed their direction frequently and their formation was carefully planned.  Qin Sang didn’t act independently, but followed Han Cuo’s commands.</p><p>As a result, Han Cuo and the others had a better impression of him.</p><p>Three days later, when they arrived at an uninhabited sea area, Qin Sang noticed that Han Cuo occasionally took out a compass-like artifact, which seemed to be some kind of directional calibration or communication device.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang’s gaze, Han Cuo explained, “Because we have to guard against both the demon and the witch clans, the market doesn’t have a fixed location. Instead, it’s held at a different location in this sea area every so often. The market is about to open. We were originally going to the market; we just happened to encounter those witch bandits, leading to this battle.”</p><p>“Many cultivators from both the human and witch clans choose to stay outside Huntian Island?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Han Cuo changed direction again, silent for a moment before saying gravely, “Compared to the cultivators on Huntian Island, those who stay outside are in the minority, though the actual number isn’t small either. Who dares to say they have a chance of Nascent Soul stage, except for those gifted with Heaven Spirit roots or Dual Spirit roots, those who diligently cultivate? The conflict between the two clans is dangerous, but hunting demons on a daily basis is equally risky. Many cultivators share my thoughts, some even more radical.”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  “Daoist Han means that Core Formation late-stage cultivators from both sides have already stepped forward to organize their forces, forming two opposing armies?”</p><p>“Even more terrifying than you think!”</p><p>Han Cuo shook his head, a hint of fear in his eyes, “Without the Island Master's control, evil cultivators are even more unscrupulous, and many desperate people have joined them, gathering in the Thousand Demon Sea. They show no mercy to either humans or witches; it's the most chaotic and bloody place outside Huntian Island.  Initially, those who approached the Thousand Demon Sea unknowingly all perished without a trace.  No one knows who the killers are, human or witch.”  “Unless your path to immortality is severed, and you're fighting for survival, it’s best not to go to the southeastern direction of Huntian Island.”</p><p>“Thousand Demon Sea?” Qin Sang's face changed slightly.</p><p>“Oh,” Han Cuo suddenly realized, “I almost forgot that Daoist Qin just arrived at Huntian Island. The situation outside Huntian Island is changing drastically; you certainly don't know about it. This is a geomantic map I often use. I have marked the latest information collected, which should be helpful to you.”</p><p>With that, Han Cuo tossed a jade slip to Qin Sang and said, “The Thousand Demon Sea was already the most dangerous place outside Huntian Island, named so because countless powerful demons lurk in this sea area. There is only one explored route in the Thousand Demon Sea, and it remains extremely dangerous. Only Core Formation mid- to late-stage cultivators dare to go there; those people are stationed along that route.”</p><p>After hastily reading the geomantic map, the last sliver of hope in Qin Sang vanished.</p><p>Han Cuo’s suggested route through the Thousand Demon Sea was the only way to the Firebird's Nest!</p><p>Right now, that path was blocked by rogue cultivators!</p><p>If I hadn't been cautious, contacted local cultivators, and gathered information, I would have blindly walked right into it. Even with the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, I probably wouldn't have survived.</p><p>Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat, terrified and deeply worried.</p><p>With the only route cut off, how could I possibly cross the Thousand Demon Sea and find the Firebird? Had I wasted half a year, only to fail?</p><p>I wonder if there's another path through the Thousand Island Sea.</p><p>Han Cuo was busy searching for the market and didn't notice Qin Sang's distress.</p><p>After a moment, Han Cuo exclaimed, "We're here!"</p><p>Then, a small islet, only a few dozen feet across, appeared ahead.  Just as Qin Sang was puzzled, Han Cuo tapped his compass.  The water rippled near the islet, and a cultivator surfaced from beneath.</p><p>"So it's Daoist Han,"</p><p>This person seemed very familiar with Han Cuo, greeting him with a broad smile.</p><p>After a brief conversation, the person gave Han Cuo something, then submerged again.  Han Cuo then signaled for everyone to conceal their presence and they continued flying in another direction.</p><p>This happened three times.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly admired the cultivators' caution, understanding it was necessary given the pressure from the demons and witches, so he didn't rush.</p><p>While worrying about crossing the Thousand Demon Sea, he silently followed Han Cuo.  Suddenly, he heard Han Cuo exclaim, "The market's ahead!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently.  A long, narrow island appeared in view.</p><p>The island was covered in overgrown grass and numerous rocky mountains. It was deserted and desolate.</p><p>From afar, it seemed unremarkable, but it held a secret.</p><p>Han Cuo led them to the island and directly to a cliff face.  Qin Sang stared at the cliff for a while, finally noticing something unusual—a very subtle but powerful restriction.</p>
