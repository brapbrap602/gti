<h1>Chapter 1523: Grand Seizure Art of Profound Heaven Primordial Qi (4k)</h1><p>In the heart of Green Goat Island.</p><p>A Daoist Temple rose from the ground.</p><p>All traces of the Yellow Heaven Gate had been completely erased.</p><p>The Daoist Temple was hidden among the towering mountains and deep valleys, not ostentatious at all.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's intention. After he left, Green Goat Temple must remain sufficiently low-key.</p><p>Qin Sang built a Cold Pond here to keep Snow Pythons.</p><p>He only kept one Heavenly Mountain Snow Python in the late Core Formation stage, which he had obtained after killing the cultivator surnamed Yue in the Holy Land. Qin Sang had requested it.</p><p>A Heavenly Mountain Snow Python in the late Core Formation stage, combined with the Python Banner, could barely participate in the battles between Nascent Soul cultivators. He left it for his external incarnation, enriching his combat methods.</p><p>The other resources were categorized by Qin Sang and left in the two Green Goat Temples. Tan Hao and Li Yufu were to manage them prudently, supporting the sect's development.</p><p>Green Goat Temple was gradually getting on the right track.</p><p>Qin Sang tried his best to pave the way for the sect.</p><p>He stood on the mountain peak, gazing around.</p><p>Green Goat Island was vast.</p><p>His gaze swept across the towering mountains, vast plains, rivers, and through the faint morning mist. He could vaguely see the distant shore, where waves undulated.</p><p>Further away, the water and sky merged, turning into a seamless expanse of azure, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>If one day he met with misfortune and perished, Green Goat Temple would be the trace he left in this world. At least, there would be people who remembered him as the founder of Green Goat Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of Reverend Jixin and Mingyue.</p><p>During his travels in the Lesser Cold Domain, he personally visited the places where this master and disciple had left their grace.</p><p>The ancestral shrines built by the common people in the past were often dilapidated, some even completely abandoned, submerged in wild grass and dense forests, forgotten by people.</p><p>Rabbits entered through the dog hole, pheasants flew from the roof beams.</p><p>Traveler's grain grew in the central courtyard, wild mallows sprouted by the well.</p><p>...</p><p>But there were also some places where incense burned brightly. The people passed down their deeds by word of mouth. In some places, they even erected steles and biographies for them, offering sacrifices every year, almost treating them as deities.</p><p>Being forgotten by everyone is true death.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang did not want this kind of 'longevity'. His goal had never changed, and he pursued it tirelessly!</p><p>The rising sun dispersed the morning mist.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, strolled down the mountain, and returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>The external incarnation was in deep meditation.</p><p>If Liuli and the others saw this, they would be surprised. The external incarnation's aura had changed. Although it still belonged to the Dao of Ice, there were obvious differences.</p><p>This was because Qin Sang had already made the external incarnation switch to cultivating the inherited cultivation technique of the Profound Heaven lineage, the "Pure Clarity Record".</p><p>After changing the cultivation technique.</p><p>The external incarnation could no longer maintain the form of a false infant and would gradually condense a true infant.</p><p>In the future, the main body's control over the external incarnation would decrease, and the probability of rebellion would increase. However, the "Pure Clarity Record" was clearly more profound than the previous cultivation technique, with a broader future.</p><p>Several divine abilities of the "Pure Clarity Record" were quite powerful.</p><p>However, what moved Qin Sang the most was that after switching to the "Pure Clarity Record", the external incarnation could cultivate the Falling Nether Spirit Restriction, or the Profound Qi Grand Hand divine ability that Yin Changsheng had once displayed.</p><p>This divine ability was called the "Grand Seizure Art of Profound Heaven Primordial Qi".</p><p>Of course, the difficulty of cultivating such top-tier divine abilities was very high, and it consumed a lot of mental energy. One person's energy was difficult to manage two at the same time. Qin Sang had not yet decided, and was waiting for Liuli's improved Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>The main body entered the cave dwelling.</p><p>The external incarnation sensed it, stopped cultivating, opened his eyes, and said, "You're back."</p><p>The main body nodded, "Fellow Daoist, you've worked hard."</p><p>"You are me, and I am you."</p><p>The external incarnation smiled, his expression lively and no different from an ordinary person, "Since it's for longevity, how can we speak of hardship?"</p><p>Having said that, the external incarnation opened his mouth, and a stream of light flew out. It was a nascent infant that had initially taken shape. The external incarnation's expression became stiff, losing its liveliness.</p><p>The nascent infant, condensed into a solid entity, was equivalent to Qin Sang's second nascent infant.</p><p>The second nascent infant paused slightly and entered Qin Sang's body.</p><p>Qin Sang was using himself to nurture the second nascent infant, keeping the external incarnation and the main body as closely connected as possible, reducing the possibility of betrayal.</p><p>After putting away the second nascent infant and the incarnation, Qin Sang meditated for a short time. Suddenly, he felt the cave dwelling's restrictions being touched. He swept his divine sense outward and found that Shi Xue had come looking for him.</p><p>"Junior Sister has sensed the Heavenly Tribulation."</p><p>Shi Xue stood at the entrance, speaking in a deep voice.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, got up, and walked out of the cave dwelling. Together with Shi Xue, they flew towards the pre-selected location for the tribulation.</p><p>Their expressions were not overly grave, nor were they nervous.</p><p>The probability of a Nascent Soul cultivator surviving the first Heavenly Tribulation was very high, unless they were seriously injured or encountered other special circumstances. Moreover, Liuli's strength was far beyond that of other cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>Qin Sang had Liuli undergo the tribulation on Green Goat Island to deter those with ill intentions.</p><p>In a short period of time, two Nascent Soul cultivators had successfully undergone tribulation on Green Goat Island. Coupled with the notorious Qin Sang, this could be considered a top-tier sect anywhere.</p><p>Even if he didn't show his face for a long time in the future, others who wanted to target Green Goat Temple would have to think twice.</p><p>Before they reached the tribulation site, the two felt the pressure from the Heavenly Might.</p><p>Looking into the distance, although it was a clear, sunny day, a cluster of dark clouds had gathered at the edge of the sky, its range growing larger and larger, accompanied by continuous rumbling of thunder.</p><p>The tribulation site was chosen on a vast plain, and all unrelated people nearby had been cleared out.</p><p>Tan Hao had arrived in advance.</p><p>"Brother Qin! Sect Master Shi!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Tan Hao greeted him and cupped his fists in salute, "The island protection grand array has been activated. I just flew around and detected some obscure gazes. No one should dare to approach Green Goat Island."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "Thank you, Brother Tan, for leading the disciples to control the grand array. Sect Master Shi and I will go over to protect Fellow Daoist Liuli."</p><p>While speaking, Qin Sang and Shi Xue flew to the mountain closest to the plain, and from afar, they saw the graceful figure in the plain.</p><p>Liuli was still without makeup, wearing a plain robe.</p><p>The Heavenly Might was approaching, dark clouds were gathering, and a fierce wind was blowing.</p><p>Her black hair danced in the wind.</p><p>Liuli glanced in their direction, then raised her head, focusing on the increasingly heavy tribulation clouds, waiting for the arrival of the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>With a flash of sword light.</p><p>The phoenix-shaped treasure sword appeared, transforming into a stream of light, circling around Liuli.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The sound of thunder was deafening.</p><p>The tribulation clouds blotted out the sky and the sun. Even outside, one could see the dark clouds above Green Goat Island and feel a trace of the Heavenly Might.</p><p>On a remote island of the Emerald Bright Archipelago.</p><p>Two middle-aged men were playing chess. The one holding the black pieces was a Nascent Soul cultivator, while the one holding the white pieces, although only in the Core Formation stage, did not appear restrained in his demeanor, clearly indicating a close relationship between the two.</p><p>Both of them were members of the Boundless Sea's merchant guilds.</p><p>Qin Sang did not prohibit other cultivators from entering the Emerald Bright Archipelago. The active merchant guilds began to consider setting up branches on the Emerald Bright Archipelago, and these two were the pioneers.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>The one holding the black pieces was the first to notice the anomaly. He dropped the chess piece, his figure flickered, and he appeared in mid-air.</p><p>A moment later, the one holding the white pieces followed, and following the gaze of the Nascent Soul cultivator, looked towards Green Goat Island.</p><p>"This is... someone undergoing Heavenly Tribulation?"</p><p>The one holding the white pieces hesitated for a moment, "Wasn't there someone who broke through to Nascent Soul on Green Goat Island a few years ago? Did Old Devil Qin cultivate so many talented disciples?"</p><p>"It's not a Nascent Soul Heavenly Tribulation," the one holding the black pieces stared for a long time and shook his head, "It's the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation that occurs once every three hundred years. Judging from its aura, it seems to be the first Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation."</p><p>"Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, could it be Old Devil Qin himself? There are rumors in the Profound Heaven Palace that Old Devil Qin's talent is astonishing. He broke through to Nascent Soul less than three hundred years ago, and his strength already surpasses all others in the cultivation world."</p><p>The one holding the white pieces looked suspicious and uncertain. When he spoke of Qin Sang, his tone unconsciously carried a hint of fear.</p><p>The one holding the black pieces pondered, "More than a month ago, I visited the island and had the honor of meeting him. There was no aura of Heavenly Tribulation on him. It shouldn't be him..."</p><p>Before he could finish his words, a sudden clap of thunder exploded.</p><p>The entire Emerald Bright Archipelago could clearly hear it. Whether mortals or cultivators, their minds were shaken, and they felt inexplicably uneasy and frightened. The higher their cultivation, the more obvious the feeling.</p><p>The plain was brightly illuminated, every detail visible.</p><p>Lightning struck down like a pillar, pouring down.</p><p>The might of the tribulation lightning was still terrifying, threatening to engulf Liuli.</p><p>However, the power of this tribulation lightning was clearly inferior to Yin Changsheng's. Qin Sang sensed it slightly, nodded inwardly, and believed that Liuli should not have much difficulty in overcoming this tribulation.</p><p>Moreover, she still had a spirit treasure as a backup.</p><p>The moment the tribulation lightning descended, Liuli continuously cast sword incantations.</p><p>The phoenix-shaped treasure sword stopped rotating, its blade standing upright, pointing directly at the sky.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>In an instant, sword energy erupted. The body of the phoenix-shaped treasure sword was invisible to the naked eye. Only a light blue sword light could be seen, faster than lightning, leaving a blue thread in the air.</p><p>The sword intent was restrained, the thread as thin as a hair, especially compared to the tribulation lightning. It appeared weak and fragile, giving the impression that it would be instantly destroyed by the tribulation lightning.</p><p>A loud 'boom' was heard.</p><p>The thread was indeed submerged by the tribulation lightning, but not only was it not destroyed, it instead burst forth with astonishing momentum. A ball of blue light erupted inside the tribulation lightning.</p><p>If someone could see through the tribulation lightning, they would find that these blue lights were actually composed of sword lights, easily obliterating the first tribulation lightning.</p><p>At the same time, Liuli flew away from the ground, rising slowly.</p><p>Her black hair danced wildly, her clothes fluttering.</p><p>Her eyes were slightly closed, and she chanted incantations. The phoenix-shaped treasure sword revealed its true form, slashing out one sword energy after another at the sky, piercing the clouds.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Liuli, a woman who refused to be inferior to men, confronted the tribulation lightning with a strong stance, engaging in a thrilling battle.</p><p>It had to be said that such a scene could easily make one's blood boil.</p><p>The tribulation clouds rotated faster and faster, as if enraged by Liuli. The might of the tribulation lightning became even more terrifying. Thick tribulation lightning, like long snakes, surged out, constantly striking.</p><p>At the last moment, countless bolts of lightning intertwined and gathered into a ball.</p><p>In mid-air, all the tribulation lightning merged into one, the lightning light dazzling, like a river of lightning, diving down.</p><p>Liuli showed no fear. She raised her hand and made a grasping motion towards the phoenix-shaped treasure sword. The treasure sword returned, she gripped it firmly, twisted her fair wrist, and fiercely slashed a sword at the sky.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The earth shook.</p><p>The sword light bloomed with brilliant radiance and then disappeared.</p><p>The tribulation lightning shattered in response. Countless lightning threads, some thick and some thin, scattered out, constantly ravaging the plain, the aftermath destroying the beautiful scenery.</p><p>After a while, the chaos subsided slightly.</p><p>The tribulation clouds showed no sign of dissipating, continuing to brew the next wave of tribulation lightning.</p><p>Liuli had landed on the ground at some point, a deep pit appearing beneath her feet, struck by the tribulation lightning. Her hair was messy, and her face was slightly pale, but fortunately, she was not injured.</p><p>She quickly calmed her breath and continued to be on high alert.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>...</p><p>Liuli used her Dharma treasures and divine abilities in succession, successfully blocking wave after wave of tribulation lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shi Xue's expressions also became increasingly relaxed.</p><p>Until the last, most terrifying tribulation lightning descended, Liuli, who had been enduring, finally unleashed her strongest divine ability—Ice Soul Divine Light!</p><p>The tribulation lightning broke through layer after layer of obstacles, coming within inches.</p><p>A ghostly blue suddenly appeared in Liuli's eyes. The remaining tribulation lightning suddenly froze without any warning, and was actually sealed in ice.</p><p>The next moment, Liuli disappeared from the spot.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The tribulation lightning shattered the ice, but it was already unable to harm Liuli in the slightest.</p><p>The imposing tribulation lightning finally reached its end. The tribulation clouds in the sky stopped rotating. Without the support of the Heavenly Might, they turned into ordinary dark clouds, scattered by the sea breeze.</p><p>"Success!"</p><p>Shi Xue's face lit up with joy, and she was about to fly towards Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly frowned and stopped Shi Xue, "Wait!"</p><p>Shi Xue was stunned, not understanding why, but she still stopped and followed Qin Sang's gaze, looking at Liuli with doubt.</p><p>The plain was a mess, covered in scorched black marks, and everywhere were deep pits.</p><p>Liuli appeared on an empty space, not looking at the tribulation clouds above, nor was she overjoyed at having survived the Heavenly Tribulation. Instead, she sat cross-legged on the spot, her expression calm.</p><p>Her actions did not seem like she was regulating her breath to recover.</p><p>Sensing the change in Liuli's aura, Shi Xue was shocked and exclaimed, "Is Junior Sister going to break through now?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, he remained silent, staring closely at Liuli. He also did not expect Liuli to be so reckless, attempting a breakthrough in her state after just undergoing tribulation.</p><p>He was considering sealing off the area around Liuli, blocking the sight of others, including Shi Xue.</p><p>It was expected that Liuli would use the Spirit-Suppressing Incense.</p><p>So far, only he and Liuli knew that there was Spirit-Suppressing Incense in the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>The Spirit-Suppressing Incense was of great importance.</p><p>News of this extraordinary treasure must not be leaked!</p><p>Although Qin Sang left the formula in Green Goat Temple, he did not mention the three words 'Spirit-Suppressing Incense', and deliberately made a layer of disguise. Only when future generations gathered all the spirit medicines and refined the Spirit-Suppressing Incense would they understand.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to do so.</p><p>He unexpectedly discovered that Liuli only took out one thing—the cicada slough of the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada.</p><p>Then, she gently tossed the cicada slough up. The ghostly blue light in her eyes became extremely intense, her eyes completely turning azure. The ghostly blue light spread out, enveloping the cicada slough.</p><p>At this moment, the cicada slough was also stained blue, as if it might come alive at any time. It was impossible to tell whether it was a living Eight-Winged Heart Cicada or a cicada slough.</p><p>Silently, the shadow of the cicada slough became fainter and fainter, gradually melting.</p><p>During the process of merging with the cicada slough, the ghostly blue light was also gradually changing. The blue color became increasingly faint from its original intensity, until only a touch of light color remained.</p><p>Qin Sang was too far away and knew very little about the Ice Soul Divine Light, so he was not clear about what benefits the cicada slough would bring to the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>But the benefits to Liuli were very obvious.</p><p>After refining the cicada slough, the ghostly blue light retreated like a tide back into Liuli's eyes.</p><p>The next moment, the aura within Liuli's body rose steadily, once again impacting the bottleneck!</p><p>The following scene was not unexpected.</p><p>Her expression suddenly changed, her body also trembled slightly, and she was affected by the evil technique's imprint again. Shi Xue was so frightened that she clenched her hands tightly, holding her breath.</p><p>But Liuli was unwavering!</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang suddenly understood, finally realizing Liuli's intention.</p><p>She was actually using the impact of the Heavenly Tribulation's might on her mind to resist the influence of the evil technique's imprint, while simultaneously using the transformation of the Ice Soul Divine Light to impact the bottleneck!</p><p>Liuli clearly had two sticks of Spirit-Suppressing Incense, and only needed one to break through to the middle stage of Nascent Soul, yet she chose to take the risk.</p><p>Her ambition... was great!</p>
