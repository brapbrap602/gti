<h1>Chapter 1111: The Three Great Merchant Alliances</h1><p>After waiting a while, Ning Wuhuai finally arrived.</p><p>He entered the White Jade Square with several disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect. Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, he glanced at him impassively and walked towards the area where the Righteous Path cultivators were gathered.</p><p>Seeing Ning Wuhuai, Qin Sang's expression softened.</p><p>He pricked up his ears, listening to the discussions among the cultivators. The cultivators in the square were all top-tier experts, and Qin Sang actually overheard many secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that not all cultivators wanted to enter the inner hall.</p><p>Many remained in the outer hall, exploring the outer hall's secret realm.</p><p>However, staying in the outer hall at this time wasn't a good idea.</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed when he arrived that due to the instability of the immortal array and the chaotic spiritual energy, the entire outer hall was in disarray.  Beasts were rampaging, and the restrictions and ancient arrays were affected, making it far more dangerous than before.</p><p>While Qin Sang was silently observing the situation, the corpse puppet pouch at his waist suddenly vibrated slightly. Qin Sang's expression shifted, and he sent his spiritual sense into the pouch.</p><p>"Be careful, Old Devil Mu is here!"</p><p>Bai issued a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. "He's in the square too?"</p><p>"Yes! I just tried using the fire curse seed to secretly investigate. Old Devil Mu's location is very close, definitely among these people," Bai said in a low voice.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, his gaze quickly sweeping across all the cultivators in the square, focusing on the Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>To understand his opponent, he had specifically investigated Old Devil Mu's background.</p><p>None of these people looked like Old Devil Mu.</p><p>Old Devil Mu was a wanted man, so he would certainly disguise his identity. But daring to enter the square so openly under the noses of the Demon Lord and Lingzhuzi was incredibly audacious.</p><p>"Can you pinpoint his true form?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, a cold light flashing.</p><p>"It's difficult."</p><p>Bai hesitated for a moment, then said, "There are too many Yuan Ying cultivators here, I dare not act rashly. Besides, the area where I sensed Old Devil Mu's approximate location is quite intriguing…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the direction Bai indicated and found that it was where the Demon Path cultivators were gathered, right near the Demon Lord.</p><p>"You mean the Demon Lord might be protecting Old Devil Mu…"</p><p>Bai hummed in agreement, saying, "During the siege of Tianfeng Island, only the Demon Lord and Lingzhuzi were present. The Demon Lord could easily create an opportunity for Old Devil Mu to escape. With Old Devil Mu's strength, it's worth the Demon Lord taking the risk to win him over.  I just wonder if Lingzhuzi noticed anything at the time."</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, not surprised at all.</p><p>The lack of news about Old Devil Mu's death had made him suspicious.</p><p>Old Devil Mu had subdued the Winter Nether Cold Flame, making him stronger than cultivators of the same level. The Demon Lord would gladly accept him as a powerful aide.</p><p>Compared to that, the lives of a few Nascent Soul cultivators were insignificant.</p><p>"He may or may not know!"</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, "Lingzhuzi's actions were to warn other Yuan Ying cultivators not to act recklessly in the Seven Killing Hall. The destruction of Tianfeng Island and Old Devil Mu's forced concealment had already achieved the goal. Unless Lingzhuzi is prepared to confront the Demon Lord directly, even if he really noticed something, he would turn a blind eye. After all, the main conflict in the current cultivation world is not the division between Righteous and Demon Paths, but the struggle between races."</p><p>There are the Yao race in the Demon Sea and the Witch race outside, and the strengths of the Righteous and Demon Paths are roughly equal. Those powerful cultivators certainly wouldn't want internal conflict among humans.</p><p>Back in Xiaohan Domain, the Red-haired Ancestor and the Mysterious Demon Sovereign also worked together.</p><p>Bai said with relief, "It's good that you understand.  Using someone else's hand to kill him is likely not feasible; we shouldn't act rashly. To take revenge, you can only rely on yourself."</p><p>"I don't know when that will be. It seems I'll just have to swallow this anger."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, dismissing his distracting thoughts.</p><p>Now, the most important thing was to find the ancient teleportation array, return to Xiaohan Domain to cultivate the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid to its peak, and attempt to reach the Nascent Soul stage. He couldn't lose his mind because of revenge.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang and Bai were secretly communicating, he suddenly smelled a fragrant scent.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and was startled.</p><p>A woman had appeared at the edge of the square, seemingly emerging from a sea of flowers. Her figure was graceful, her beauty striking, and her every move possessed a captivating charm.</p><p>As soon as she appeared, she attracted the attention of all the cultivators, causing murmurs of admiration.</p><p>Even Lingzhuzi and the Demon Lord were startled and looked over.</p><p>"It's Daoist Qingyun. Daoist Ji and Daoist Bai Li should be arriving soon, too,"</p><p>Lingzhuzi's eyes flashed as he spoke.</p><p>As soon as he said this, the square erupted in an uproar.</p><p>Qin Sang also showed a surprised expression.</p><p>One of the three major merchant alliances, the Xi You Alliance, was led by Qing Yun, a woman rumored to be exceptionally beautiful and talented.  Today's meeting proved those rumors true.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi mentioned two other leaders: those of the Bei Chen and Dong Ji Alliances.</p><p>More and more human cultivators were arriving.</p><p>The leaders of both the righteous and demonic paths, and the three merchant alliances—representing the most powerful factions among humans—had gathered at the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>The Xi You Alliance leader approached gracefully.</p><p>Her goal wasn't to side with either the righteous or demonic path, but rather to remain neutral.</p><p>Cultivators at the Golden Core stage respectfully made way, while Yuan Ying masters greeted her with smiles. The three merchant alliances were loose confederations, not sects, yet they had intricate connections with various factions.</p><p>Qin Sang observed Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord's expressions, but could glean nothing from them.</p><p>"I came alone," Qing Yun said calmly, "I don't know when Ji Daoyou and Bai Li Daoyou will arrive."</p><p>Ling Zhuzi chuckled disbelievingly.</p><p>The Demon Lord sneered, "Everyone knows the three merchant alliances are closely linked.  You three rarely leave your secluded residences, and even more rarely enter this secret realm alone.  One might think someone was threatening you."</p><p>The Demon Lord's tone was unfriendly.</p><p>Qing Yun remained composed, neither humble nor arrogant. "We three have relatively low cultivation, yet carry the heavy responsibilities of our alliances.  We must be extremely cautious. We established the alliances to better support cultivation, yet some ascribe imagined conspiracies to us. I have to be wary; if I lose my life, what else matters?"</p><p>Suddenly, a tearing sound broke the silence.  Everyone looked up to see two figures arriving swiftly.</p><p>One was a tall, imposing elder with a ruddy face; the other resembled a refined scholar.</p><p>They landed in the square, their gazes sweeping across the assembled crowd.</p><p>The ruddy-faced elder laughed heartily, striding forward with a booming voice.</p><p>"Fellow cultivators, we've arrived! Ji and Bai Li arrived a little late, but hopefully not too late for the main event!"</p><p>The scholar followed, greeting Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord.  He then glanced at Qing Yun, who remained expressionless and unresponsive. He frowned slightly, sighing inwardly.</p><p>"Ji Daoyou! Bai Li Daoyou!"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi returned the greeting. "The Seven Killing Hall's trial realm hasn't opened yet. You've arrived just in time."</p>
