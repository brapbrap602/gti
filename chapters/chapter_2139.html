<h1>Chapter 2129  Sacred Mountain</h1><p>Great Compassion Zen Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped out of the translocation array and immediately felt the oppressive atmosphere hanging over the temple.</p><p>Flying into the air, the scene of the battlefield came into view.</p><p>The Grand Protector led a large army, charging aggressively.  Under the impact of this overwhelming force, the rain seemed to stagnate.</p><p>The Thunder Altar was already activated and poised to strike.</p><p>In the Yue Du Bay battle, he had personally participated, deceiving the perception of the Old Ancestor Ming Hu, because the Thunder Altar needed time to activate; before its full power could be unleashed, Ming Hu might have escaped.</p><p>The new Thunder Altar, both in power and speed of activation, was vastly superior, but because the Si You tribe possessed unique abilities and possessed miraculous treasures to save their leader, he still needed to come in person.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>The sound of the rainstorm was incessant, filling the ears.</p><p>Under the gloomy sky, the Grand Protector's eyes were bright and piercing, like lightning, seemingly able to penetrate the rain curtain.</p><p>He didn't hide his figure, standing proudly at the front of the army, with thousands of troops behind him!</p><p>Qin Sang saw him at a glance, his expression darkening slightly, his figure quietly merging into the rain.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Lu Wang army approached the rain curtain. The Grand Protector, his posture upright and without hesitation, led his army into it.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The rainstorm was like a gaping abyss.</p><p>Entering the rain curtain, the familiar sight appeared again: countless shadows silently standing in the rain, waiting for them.</p><p>The figures were dense and endless, silent and eerily still.</p><p>These were the Thunder Soldiers, their old foes, but this time they were prepared.</p><p>Before close combat, clouds of mist rose from the Lu Wang army's formations. They were still using the same formations, but the formation's focal point was now a Si You tribe strongman. However, with the experience from last time, they could now target the formation's weak point, making the core much safer.</p><p>The clouds connected, rising into the sky, and the rain weakened.</p><p>After searching for a moment, the Grand Protector found no trace of Qin Sang and the others. Without hesitation, he ordered the army to attack.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The two armies collided suddenly, the impact earth-shattering.</p><p>The clouds moved with the cultivators, and the flow of the clouds revealed the distribution of the Lu Wang army's forces.</p><p>Like sharp knives, they pierced into the Thunder Soldier formations, unstoppable. In an instant, countless Thunder Soldiers fell.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>The Grand Protector had been searching the surroundings for Qin Sang and the others, and now seemed to sense something, his expression shifting slightly, but then he was drawn to something else.</p><p>Qin Sang, Shuang Diao, the stone statue, and Huo Ling appeared simultaneously, as before, charging into the battlefield from four different directions.</p><p>Except for Qin Sang, Shuang Diao, the stone statue, and Huo Ling had average strength and mostly played a harassing role.  The Grand Protector immediately dispatched troops to meet them, and secretly sent a message to Li Yue, ordering him to intercept Qin Sang.</p><p>Last time, Li Yue fought Qin Sang alone, falling into the sword formation right away, his cultivation useless as he only struck empty air.</p><p>With the Grand Protector present this time, Li Yue swore to redeem himself, immediately summoning his companion beast, donning his spirit armor, and stepping forward.</p><p>At the same time, the Grand Protector brought out a Hexagram Talisman, and the other Si You tribe strongmen also brought out this treasure. The talismans hung in the air, rotating constantly, responding to the situation, preventing the Five Elements Crown from activating.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Li Yue moved like an avalanche, the void trembled, his momentum overpowering Qin Sang's.</p><p>A clang of a sword.</p><p>As before, Qin Sang's first move was a flying sword, the Gray Sparrow Sword slashing toward Li Yue.</p><p>Li Yue's response was also the same as before: he wanted to resist the spirit sword with his physical strength, seemingly forgetting the previous lesson.</p><p>As he wished, the sword light flashed in mid-air, and then the spirit sword disappeared, the void suddenly becoming extremely silent, the sword formation unfolding, and Li Yue instantly fell into the formation.</p><p>At the moment of success, Qin Sang suddenly heard a dog's howl, his gaze focused, looking towards Li Yue's rear. He saw two black-furred spirit hounds, one on each side, crouching at the Grand Protector's feet.</p><p>The hounds had short, fine fur, long wedge-shaped heads, deep chests and narrow waists, and slender legs, straight in front and arched behind.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the two hounds were the Grand Protector's companion beasts.</p><p>They raised their heads to the sky, emitting a series of long howls, the howls far-reaching and highly penetrating, able to pierce through the clouds.</p><p>After a moment, a faint light poured into the battlefield. A circular spot of light appeared in the sky, gradually brightening, like a full moon hanging in the sky.</p><p>Spirit Hound Howls at the Moon!</p><p>The 'full moon' shot a beam of light, falling into the sword formation.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed a connection forming between Li Yue and "Full Moon" within the array.  Feeling uneasy, she continuously shifted the formation, but couldn't sever the link.</p><p>Li Yue, on the other hand, initially felt disoriented after entering the sword array, facing the vast starry expanse.  His previous encounter had been too hasty to fully grasp the array's weaknesses.  But with "Full Moon" appearing, his confusion vanished, as if guided.  He sharply turned, his gaze as sharp as a blade, fixing on a particular sword star before charging, like a raging bull, his momentum terrifying.</p><p>Li Yue's cultivation was already considerable, further aided by the Grand Protector.  His relentless assault on the sword array might actually break it.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Grand Protector, who was still attempting to remotely control the battlefield.  But she wouldn't let him succeed.</p><p>Just then, the same feeling the Grand Protector had experienced earlier returned.  The battlefield situation was unexpected; the thunder troops were significantly weakened, showing signs of defeat after a brief clash.  Despite their thorough preparations, this swift outcome was unexpected.</p><p>"Are they going to abandon the Great Compassion Temple?"</p><p>In fact, after Qin Sang activated the sacrificial thunder oath but held back its full power, all the altar masters were under immense pressure.  The longer the thunder talismans remained inactive, the greater the pressure became.</p><p>At this point, including Su Nu and the other two, no one dared to be distracted. The Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique was pre-activated by Qin Sang, utilizing stored power.  Each bit spent meant less remained; without the altar masters' cooperation, many variations couldn't be used, resulting in the Lu Wang army's overwhelming advance.</p><p>The Grand Protector noticed this, but before he could analyze it, he was startled by thunder.</p><p>The Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman moved according to his will, thunder filling the sky, transforming into a thunder seal.  The terrifying power of the thunder shattered the void, striking at Li Yue within the array.</p><p>Qin Sang poured almost all her power into this strike. Even someone as powerful as Li Yue would be severely injured, if not killed, if he couldn't dodge.</p><p>However, the Grand Protector wouldn't let Qin Sang succeed so easily.  A golden light immediately shot from his sleeve.</p><p>He was prepared, holding nothing back.  The Heaven-Binding Golden Lock unleashed its full power, an obscure ripple spreading with the golden light.</p><p>Nearly all the Transcendence-level experts on the battlefield were drawn to this ripple, for it was the power they had long sought—the power of a Dharma Realm!  Only Qin Sang could discern that it was still far from a true Dharma Realm.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Grand Protector’s ability to use the pseudo-Dharma Realm with the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock placed him among the top of his rank.</p><p>The pseudo-Dharma Realm enveloped the battlefield, dimming the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal.  Before, even if not annihilated, the thunder's power would have been severely hindered.  But after forging the thunder altar, Qin Sang had made significant progress, refining the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal to its peak, giving it power exceeding his own cultivation level.</p><p>"Rumble…"</p><p>The thunder continued.</p><p>Amidst the golden light, azure thunder, like sharp arrows, pierced the sky, aiming to penetrate the pseudo-Dharma Realm.</p><p>The Grand Protector's expression was grave.  The thunder's power exceeded his expectations.  He urgently chanted incantations, the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock emitting a series of locking clicks, golden waves surging within the pseudo-Dharma Realm.</p><p>Just as the thunder seal and the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock clashed, the Grand Protector sensed something unusual and abruptly looked toward the sword array.</p><p>Through the two spirit hound familiars and "Full Moon," he had established a connection with Li Yue, subtly perceiving his changes.</p><p>What Li Yue now conveyed was—terror!</p><p>Li Yue, a mid-stage Void Realm Second Stage cultivator, with three familiars possessing him, facing an opponent of the same level, who was already being held in check – why would he feel terror?</p><p>Within the sword array…</p><p>Li Yue was running wildly across the starry sky, wielding powerful punches, smashing sword stars with extreme ferocity, unstoppable.</p><p>The sword array seemed powerless against him.</p><p>But just as the situation was looking favorable, countless sword stars suddenly trembled, starlight converging into the White Tiger and Vermilion Bird凶煞, attacking Li Yue together.</p><p>Li Yue stopped, bracing himself, and then sensed the anomaly.  As the凶煞 attacked, the array seemed to have undergone a change; the starry sky felt completely foreign.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Li Yue's face changed drastically, a flash of horror in his eyes.</p><p>A Sword Realm!</p><p>He had witnessed the Grand Protector creating a pseudo-Dharma Realm with the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, but the aura of this Sword Realm was more real, a true Dharma Realm!</p><p>Though Li Yue considered himself exceptionally capable, he didn't believe he could win against a Sword Realm.  His opponent, at the same level, had actually comprehended a Dharma Realm.</p><p>At the same time, the Grand Protector outside also sensed the aura of the Sword Realm.</p><p>Li Yue, a high-ranking general, must be saved.  The Grand Consecrate raised his right hand, palm cupped around a treasure vase.  The vase, slender-necked and round-bellied, shimmered with light, becoming translucent in his hand.</p><p>Inside, there was only a globe of light, shifting in brightness, emitting two dazzling white beams.</p><p>These two beams, centered on the vase, crossed each other, forming a rapidly spinning cross of light.  Instantly, this transformed into a giant wheel of light, which tilted and sliced into the sword array at incredible speed.</p><p>At that moment, the Grand Consecrate’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang, having once mimicked a trace of the aura of a Dao Domain, had terrified Gu Yun Old Man and Ming Hu Old Ancestor. But the Grand Consecrate, with his extensive experience, had witnessed a true Dao Domain and could even deploy a pseudo-domain.</p><p>"Mere imitation!"</p><p>He sneered coldly, though inwardly astonished.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang's sword domain was only a superficial imitation, the fact that he could manifest it proved he had glimpsed its principles. Any late-stage cultivator hearing this would likely be envious—the Grand Consecrate was no exception, and killing intent arose within him.</p><p>He even began to doubt the wisdom of provoking Qin Sang in this operation, though the Mist Sea was ultimately the domain of the Yi people; outsiders could not stir up much trouble.</p><p>As these thoughts raced through his mind, the light wheel and the sword array collided.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang appeared within the sword array. Ignoring the light wheel beside him, he looked at the Grand Consecrate, murmuring, “This distance… is enough.”</p><p>The next instant, a crystal pagoda flew from his chest.</p><p>A three-tiered pagoda—the Void-Breaking Spirit Pagoda!</p><p>Upon seeing it, the Grand Consecrate's expression froze, a sudden sense of danger seizing him.</p><p>*CRASH!*</p><p>*BANG!*</p><p>The Void-Breaking Spirit Pagoda shattered completely, fragments flying everywhere, continuing to break down into the finest dust, dispersing on the wind.</p><p>The pagoda was undoubtedly a treasure capable of suppressing the Siyou race, but it was extremely difficult to refine and had a limited number of uses; with careful calculation, it could be used three times at most.</p><p>To ensure success, Qin Sang unleashed the pagoda's power without reservation.</p><p>An invisible, subtle force spread with the dust, permeating the battlefield.</p><p>Simultaneously, all the altars in the Storm Realm activated, cultivators performing incantations, their resonant chants shaking the heavens!</p><p>…</p><p>The Foul Land.</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma Image followed Min Zhuo to the source of the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>It seemed to pass through a barrier; the sea vanished ahead, revealing a deep, dark abyss before Qin Sang.</p><p>Looking around, he was reminded of the scene of the Return Abyss he had witnessed before. It too was an abyss where seawater cascaded down in waterfalls.</p><p>However, the Return Abyss was vibrant and full of strange phenomena; this abyss was pure darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang lost sight of Min Zhuo, but he wasn't worried.  The vibrations emanating from the abyss grew increasingly clear; following their source would lead him to his target.</p><p>He flapped his wings, flying into the depths of the abyss, feeling the pressure steadily increase.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang encountered his first obstacle: a damaged ancient prohibition.</p><p>Although broken, the prohibition's emanations revealed considerable power.</p><p>After a moment's deduction, Qin Sang carefully passed through it.  Shortly after, he encountered another.</p><p>He had heard Mo Xingdao recount his experiences in the Return Abyss, a place rife with such prohibitions and danger.</p><p>“Could this truly be a transformed part of the Return Abyss, or perhaps a remnant?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, then saw a flash of azure light—a wisp of Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>The prohibitions here did not harm it.  The Azure Spirit Qi passed unimpeded.  Qin Sang captured it, observed it for a moment, then released it without taking it.</p><p>Continuing onward, nearing the source of the vibrations, Qin Sang finally found Min Zhuo.</p><p>Because they took different routes, Min Zhuo's warning measures remained untouched, completely unaware of the pursuer closing in.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The vibrations grew clear, just ahead.</p><p>Min Zhuo, impatient, suddenly accelerated.  Moments later, points of azure light appeared in the darkness ahead.</p><p>Several wisps of Azure Spirit Qi passed him, unnoticed. He focused intently on the end of the darkness.</p><p>There, within a dense mass of azure light, a divine mountain stood, dominating the darkness, captivating Min Zhuo’s gaze.</p><p>The mountain was barren, a stone mountain, towering and precipitous, jagged and rugged, its cliffs and rocks a vibrant azure, appearing incredibly heavy yet somehow suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The mountain trembled, seemingly struggling against some constraint, striving to break free from the abyss and return to the world.</p><p>Each tremor intensified the azure light, revealing a fissure that almost bisected the mountain—the source of the light, and the source of the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>Facing the mountain, a sense of awe mingled with greed filled Min Zhuo’s eyes.</p>
