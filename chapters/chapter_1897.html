<h1>Chapter 1888: The Swordsman Guards the Heavenly Gate</h1><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Zhongmao Prefecture, Jizhen Garrison.</p><p>A roar, akin to a tiger's, shook the Immortal City.</p><p>This tiger's roar even drowned out the combined roars of the beast tide, causing the surrounding ferocious beasts to tremble and the cultivators' hearts to pound in their chests.</p><p>Realist Ruoquan awoke with a start, his gaze fixed on the north. There, amidst billowing yellow smoke, he could faintly make out a ferocious tiger sprinting towards the Immortal City.</p><p>The tiger was the size of a mountain, each stride shattering peaks and flattening valleys. Its massive, copper-bell eyes radiated a terrifying凶light, locked onto the city.</p><p>All the beasts prostrated themselves!</p><p>The first Great Calamity had finally arrived!</p><p>Realist Ruoquan's face paled. He anxiously looked towards the Pacification Altar.</p><p>With only the city's protective formation and the cultivators present, they had no hope of withstanding the assault of a True Monarch-level beast.</p><p>Zhongmao Prefecture, Governance Altar.</p><p>The two Grand Realists sensed the approaching danger and looked towards Jizhen Garrison.</p><p>One began chanting:</p><p>“The Supreme Moon in the Middle Heaven, Pure light illuminates ten thousand paths.</p><p>Wind shakes the pine, moon breaks through, wind stills, moon remains whole.”</p><p>The other continued:</p><p>“Cool shade divides the four seasons, long and short endure the three watches.</p><p>Only for its selfless illumination, it follows the wind to the Grand Emptiness.”</p><p>The chanting spread from the Governance Altar to all the Dharma Altars under the Heavenly Hub Institute’s jurisdiction, reaching the ears of every altar master and officiating cultivator.</p><p>Those well-versed in the Daoist scriptures instantly understood the upcoming ritual upon hearing these opening verses. Excitement filled their eyes as they followed the commands,符talismans glowing softly in response to the Governance Altar.</p><p>All the Realists reverently proclaimed: “Heavenly Venerable Miao Guo Suyue!”</p><p>The Dharma Altars beneath the two Grand Realists trembled slightly. As if sensing their call, the moon in the Middle Heaven cast a gentle radiance upon the Zhongmao Governance Altar. The two Grand Realists appeared ethereal, veiled in a shimmering lunar gauze.</p><p>Within the moonlight, their voices resonated in unison:</p><p>“Middle Heaven's Divine Moon, Crimson dawn breaks.</p><p>Three scenes illuminate together, all heavens brighten.</p><p>Rivers and seas fall silent, mountains conceal smoke.</p><p>A single incense stick offered, a precious name proclaimed.”</p><p>As the incantation continued, divine符talismanic light flickered between the two Grand Realists, finally manifesting a spiritual incense stick. Its fragrant smoke drifted upwards, reaching the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The Realists devoutly chanted again: “Heavenly Venerable Miao Guo Suyue!”</p><p>The resounding chant shook the moon in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Looking up from within Zhongmao Prefecture, one could see the lunar halo surrounding the moon expand almost twofold.</p><p>Outside the nested double moon, a third moon seemed to appear.</p><p>At this moment, the Grand Realist positioned to the north on the Governance Altar rose. With a flick of his dust whisk, he began pacing in accordance with the celestial constellations.</p><p>“A truly pure heart, the Dao as its foundation, like the precious moon in the Middle Heaven.</p><p>Sweeping away the confusing clouds, without a speck of blemish, a single disc of light fills the vast emptiness.”</p><p>The Realists echoed his words.</p><p>He continued chanting several more verses, each requiring corresponding divine符talismans and precise hand seals synchronized with his steps.</p><p>The Realists’ expressions grew solemn, as if in the presence of a sacred being. They chanted in unison, their voices imbued with a unique rhythm.</p><p>“Pure and pristine moonlight, gentle breeze resides within.</p><p>Dividing the void, setting the scene, gathering Qi, suspending the heavens.</p><p>Today's descendants, admire the pure dust.</p><p>We pledge our allegiance, merging with the Dao, becoming one with truth!”</p><p>Bright moonlight bathed the land in its pure radiance. The moon grew increasingly brighter, as if it were about to descend from the heavens.</p><p>Within the Divine Court.</p><p>A divine hall bore a plaque inscribed with: "Moon Palace Yellow Flower Pure Radiance Primordial Essence Holy Queen Taiyin Yuanjun."</p><p>This was the hall of Taiyin Yuanjun, one of the Nine Luminary Star Lords, also known as the "Taiyin Imperial Sovereign."</p><p>Inside, the statue of Taiyin Yuanjun radiated a cool lunar glow, clearly sensing the summons from the lower realm.</p><p>The Grand Realist holding the dust whisk raised his head towards the heavens and bowed, declaring:</p><p>“A gentle breeze caresses the face, true fragrance penetrates the Taiyin Palace.</p><p>The bright moon proclaims the words, a decree requests the descent of the supreme decree!”</p><p>With the incantation complete, the Grand Realist abruptly flung his dust whisk northward, pointing towards Jizhen Garrison.</p><p>Within the Pacification Altar of Jizhen Garrison's Immortal City, divine light suddenly shot towards the constellations of the Ox and the Dipper. A figure ascended with the divine light, a female Daoist priestess clad in ceremonial robes.</p><p>Her expression was serious, adorned with a Hibiscus Azure Sky Crown and a rhinoceros horn hairpin.</p><p>She wore purple Daoist robes embroidered with emerald and five-colored clouds, complemented by a thirty-two-stranded purple cloud and five-colored stole.</p><p>A crimson skirt with five panels and four folds, a jade pendant at her waist.</p><p>She ascended, her gaze fixed on the Middle Heaven, her aura resonating with the celestial moon.</p><p>At this moment, all the moonlight within Zhongmao Prefecture converged towards Jizhen Garrison.</p><p>The moon in the Middle Heaven shone brilliantly.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The priestess spread her arms, her Daoist robes billowing around her.</p><p>A beam of moonlight descended from the heavens.</p><p>Every cultivator gazed upon her with reverence and excitement. Bathed in moonlight, she appeared ethereal, like Taiyin Yuanjun descending to the mortal realm.</p><p>Boundless divine power poured into her through her crown. Her aura surged, yet her beautiful face contorted, as if enduring terrible pain and冲击. Clenching her teeth, she finally crossed a certain threshold.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Outside the Immortal City, the ferocious tiger landed heavily, its forward momentum momentarily checked. Its fierce eyes were fixed on the celestial priestess, sensing a threat from her. It roared ferociously.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The priestess opened her eyes, devoid of emotion. Divine light shot out like lightning, piercing the depths of the tiger's gaze, provoking an even more savage roar.</p><p>The tiger transformed into yellow smoke and charged towards the Immortal City!</p><p>…</p><p>The ground war raged on.</p><p>Within the lunar halo, outside the Divine Court.</p><p>Celestial Master Tianyue stood before the Heavenly Gate, his sword raised, facing a demon race Great Sage alone.</p><p>“Get out of my way!”</p><p>A five-clawed golden dragon, wreathed in滔天golden flames, swung its tail, lashing out at Celestial Master Tianyue.</p><p>With a single swing, the dragon's tail transformed into a ten-thousand-zhang golden rainbow, its power awe-inspiring.</p><p>Facing this terrifying attack, Celestial Master Tianyue remained calm. He pointed with his sword, summoning countless beams of sword energy that shot out in unison.</p><p>The sword energy formed a river of swords, vast and boundless, its sharpness unparalleled, as if capable of piercing any obstacle. It clashed head-on with the golden rainbow.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The tip of the golden rainbow shattered, scattering fragments of golden light.</p><p>The river of swords surged forward within the ten-thousand-zhang golden rainbow, unstoppable, like a bamboo splitting through its sheath!</p><p>The sword's edge pointed directly at the dragon's head!</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon felt a faint pain in its brow. Its gaze narrowed as it raised its forepaw, swiping through the void. Intense golden light erupted, forming a gigantic golden claw before the dragon's body.</p><p>The claw was immense, its tips sharp as blades, grasping towards the river of swords with the force of wind and thunder.</p><p>‘Rumble… ’</p><p>The void seemed to tear under the dragon's claw.</p><p>As the river of swords pierced through the ten-thousand-zhang golden rainbow, the dragon claw arrived.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>The dragon claw clenched, grasping countless beams of sword energy. The sword energy struck the claw, as if hitting metal, and dissipated.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon thrashed its body, attempting to bypass Celestial Master Tianyue. However, as it moved, a deafening tearing sound echoed.</p><p>The seemingly dominant dragon claw shattered into four pieces, and the river of swords surged forward with heaven-splitting momentum.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon's expression shifted dramatically. It let out a hurried growl as its scales shimmered, and a golden armor materialized around its body.</p><p>The ancient armor radiated golden light, swirling around the five-clawed golden dragon like a vortex.</p><p>Seeing this, Celestial Master Tianyue instantly changed his sword technique. The river of swords, originally aimed at the dragon, retracted its momentum. Its head and tail connected, forming a ring of swords that encircled the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>As the ring of swords closed, Celestial Master Tianyue sensed something amiss. He furrowed his brow.</p><p>A deep rumble then emanated from within the ring of swords, and a shadowy light appeared within the golden vortex.</p><p>This light was eerie, seemingly capable of devouring the golden light.  A chilling sensation washed over anyone who looked upon it.</p><p>As the shadowy light rapidly spread, its source revealed itself to be an obelisk.</p><p>The obelisk stood upon the five-clawed golden dragon's back. It was entirely black, its surface covered in cryptic inscriptions. The characters were twisted and curved, as eerie as the shadowy light itself.</p><p>The golden dragon carried the obelisk, raising its head in a furious roar!</p><p>The obelisk vibrated, unleashing a surge of shadowy light, like a terrifying tidal wave, or a fog of countless vengeful spirits. Its power was horrifying as it crashed against the ring of swords.</p><p>The light within the ring of swords dimmed. Countless beams of sword energy were tainted by the shadowy light, turning black before vanishing.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon lunged forward, breaking through the encirclement of swords. It was about to continue its assault when a sudden sense of foreboding washed over it.</p><p>The ring of swords dissipated.</p><p>In its place appeared a single beam of sword light, a single spiritual sword.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A three-foot long azure blade hung upside down from the highest point of the sky. As it plummeted, its momentum intensified, transforming into a rainbow of sword light. Its tip pointed directly at the five-clawed golden dragon's reverse scale, its vital weak point.</p><p>Locked onto by the sword intent, the five-clawed golden dragon felt a jolt of fear. Protected by its golden armor and possessing immense physical strength, it felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p>If it continued its charge and was struck by this sword, it would be gravely injured, if not killed!</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon had overestimated its opponent. It had never imagined that this man, without even wielding that Heaven-Sundering Divine Sword, could possess such terrifying swordsmanship!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>In its desperation, the five-clawed golden dragon abandoned its charge, shifting its massive body sideways. It puffed out its cheeks and spat out a ball of golden light.</p><p>This golden light lacked the spectacle of its previous attacks, yet it was far more condensed, resembling a dragon pearl.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sound of the impact reverberated throughout the heavens.</p><p>The spiritual sword halted mid-air.</p><p>The golden pearl dimmed abruptly, shooting back towards the five-clawed golden dragon, which swallowed it.</p><p>The dragon groaned, its body trembling, as if it had suffered a blow.  Killing intent radiated from its eyes.</p><p>“You court death!”</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon snarled, abandoning its initial plan to charge forward.</p><p>It had sensed its own Guardian Deity of the altar.  Its gaze shifted past Celestial Master Tianyue, landing upon the Divine Court.</p><p>In the next instant, emerald light appeared on the horizon.</p><p>Wind and thunder roared.</p><p>The emerald light, like pure wood essence, shot towards the five-clawed golden dragon and merged into its body.</p><p>Despite being a five-clawed golden dragon, it summoned the Star Lord of Wood Virtue and Year, one of the Nine Luminaries.</p><p>Already a Great Sage, it summoned a Guardian Deity of equivalent rank, thus bypassing the complex rituals required by Grand Realists.</p><p>Demonic cultivation was ultimately inferior to orthodox methods. It could only summon Guardian Deities, not higher-ranking符talismanic deities.</p><p>After undergoing Divine Transformation, the burden on the dragon was greater.</p><p>However, the five-clawed golden dragon couldn't afford to hesitate.  It had to give its all to enter the Divine Court!</p><p>“Divine Transformation?”</p><p>Celestial Master Tianyue recalled the Dao Court’s teachings, his expression growing more serious, but he remained composed.</p><p>This was within his expectations.</p><p>Divine power originated from符talismanic deities. After undergoing Divine Transformation, cultivators gained the most significant improvements in their符talismanic arts.</p><p>The demon race, however, focused on their bloodline abilities, unable to fully utilize the power of Divine Transformation.</p><p>Of course, slaying the five-clawed golden dragon wouldn't be easy.</p><p>‘Ding!’</p><p>The spiritual sword trembled slightly.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon's ferocious expression froze.</p><p>This time, there were no myriad sword beams, not even the spiritual sword itself remained visible.</p><p>Yet, within the five-clawed golden dragon's perception, sword intent permeated the surrounding void!</p><p>No matter which direction it charged, it would be blocked by the pervasive sword intent.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Thunder rumbled.</p><p>Emerald demonic lightning erupted beneath the five-clawed golden dragon, its power immense, instantly filling half the sky.</p><p>The demonic lightning struck the surrounding void.</p><p>The void exuded an inexplicable sense of darkness, yet to the naked eye, it appeared empty.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Without warning, vast swathes of demonic lightning vanished, fleeting glimpses of sword shadows flashing within.</p><p>Gaps appeared in the lightning net. It seemed as if several spiritual swords were moving simultaneously, shattering the demonic lightning and striking at the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>The dragon soared into the sky, conjuring a bone-chilling demonic wind.  With a swipe of its claws, thick bolts of demonic lightning materialized, frantically lashing out at the invisible sword intent.</p><p>Simultaneously, treasures shimmered around the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>Following the golden armor, obelisk, and dragon pearl, it unleashed several more treasures, some intact, some damaged.  All were heirlooms of the Ghost Fang Kingdom, each possessing unparalleled power.</p><p>In contrast, Celestial Master Tianyue wielded only a single sword, or rather, two.</p><p>He channeled the Heaven-Sundering Divine Sword, sending two sword projections towards the Calamity Source and the Calamity Sea, while simultaneously using his natal spiritual sword to confront the demon race Great Sage. He was effectively multitasking with his mind divided three ways.</p><p>Relying on a single sword, he neutralized all the five-clawed golden dragon’s attacks, preventing it from advancing even a single step.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon roared in frustration.</p><p>The roar reached the Great Sage's Palace.</p><p>The demon soldiers within were on high alert, anticipating an attack from a Dao Court True Monarch.  Unexpectedly, the True Monarch chose not to assault the Great Sage's Palace and seize the Demon Calling Drum.</p><p>Hearing their Great Sage's roar, the demon soldiers immediately changed formation.</p><p>The Great Sage's Palace, now teeming with demon soldiers, moved as one, forming a complex demonic formation.</p><p>Demon Kings formed the core of the formation.</p><p>As the formation took shape, the Demon Kings pointed towards the heavens. Spiritual light, like swords, shot towards the celestial pole, providing long-range support to their Great Sage.</p><p>The pressure on the sword-wielding Realist intensified, his vision filled with the blinding light of demonic lightning.</p><p>His face paled, yet he stood tall, one hand resting on the hilt of the Heaven-Sundering Divine Sword, calmly observing his opponent, refusing to yield.</p><p>At this critical juncture, a change occurred within the Calamity Source and the Calamity Sea.</p><p>The Great Calamities' ferocious nature took over, prompting them to attack the sword projections.</p><p>The projections had lost their deterrent power, and the Dao Gate now possessed some ability to resist.</p><p>Celestial Master Tianyue glanced towards the ground, directing the sword projections to deliver one final strike, repelling the Great Calamities. He then withdrew his sword intent, feeling the pressure lessen significantly.</p><p>‘Slap!’</p><p>Celestial Master Tianyue removed his hand from the hilt of the Heaven-Sundering Divine Sword. He took a step forward, his foot landing on empty air, causing the demonic lightning before him to momentarily stagnate.</p><p>Golden light flickered within the demonic lightning, revealing the near-frenzied form of the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The spiritual sword materialized before Celestial Master Tianyue. The sword intent abruptly retracted.</p><p>Celestial Master Tianyue’s eyes gleamed.  He laughed, his laughter booming over the thunder, filled with awe-inspiring spirit. “Please, fellow Daoist, receive one more sword from this old man!”</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>Sword light erupted for ten thousand zhang, its momentum like a rainbow!</p><p>…</p><p>While Celestial Master Tianyue battled the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>Within the Bestowal Institute of Zhongmao Prefecture's Governance Altar.</p><p>Grand Realist Zhang, seated on the altar, holding the Merit Seal, stirred slightly.  The influx of Heaven and Earth spiritual energy into the Bestowal Institute momentarily paused, then surged into his body with even greater force.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Grand Realist Zhang achieved a breakthrough. However, he didn't stop.  After briefly stabilizing his cultivation, he continued absorbing spiritual energy.</p><p>Shortly after, a similar event occurred within the Bestowal Institute of Baishi Prefecture's Governance Altar.</p><p>Holding the Merit Seal of Baishi Prefecture, Kundao's expression remained serene as her cultivation smoothly crossed the bottleneck, following close behind Grand Realist Zhang, entering the middle stage of the River Chart Dharma Position.</p><p>Unlike Grand Realist Zhang, Kundao didn't wait to consolidate her cultivation.  She slowly rose to her feet, her steps light as she exited the Bestowal Institute.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
